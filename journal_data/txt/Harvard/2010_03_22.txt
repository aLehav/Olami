After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After barely two months in office, Virginia’s attorney general seems to have determined that his state’s legal policies are not controversial enough. How else to explain his decision to send a letter to Virginia universities and colleges instructing them to ban protections on gay rights? In the document, Attorney General Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II advised that, “The law and public policy of the Commonwealth of Virginia prohibit a college or university from including ‘sexual orientation,’ ‘gender identity,’ ‘gender expression,’ or like terms in its non-discrimination policy.” The attorney general may be right about a legal technicality. However, if addressing it means abolishing important protective measures, he should focus first on instituting equivalent state protections.
Cuccinelli may indeed have had sound legal reasoning behind his move. According to him, the Virginia General Assembly has never given specific authorization for such discrimination protections, and in-state colleges and universities are overstepping their bounds by employing them. The attorney general cited the Virginia Human Rights Act, which singled out race, color, religion, national origin, and sex as affiliations deserving of special protections—but not sexual orientation. He also pointed out that the General Assembly has voted 25 times not to include “sexual orientation” in various nondiscrimination measures since 1997.
However, this legal technicality is a small concern that Cuccinelli has pointed out in order to nullify more important protective measures. Article one, section one of the constitution of Virginia concerns the “equality and rights of man.” It states, “That all men are by nature equally free and independent and have certain inherent rights.” This statute clearly allows for myriad protections against discrimination, and Virginia’s institutions of higher education have simply been upholding a similar standard of rights. It should be the focus of the attorney general to bring the specific texts of Virginia’s laws in line with such overarching legal principles.
Moreover, Cuccinelli’s move is a targeted attack on a minority group. The Commonwealth of Virginia allows colleges and universities to operate under other policies without explicit permission; for example, a former Virginia assistant Commonwealth attorney pointed out that many places of higher education prevent their staff and students from carrying concealed weapons on the premises, even though this rule does not apply in the rest of Virginia. By singling out this specific legal point at this specific time, Cuccinelli’s letter seems suspiciously discriminatory itself.
Whether or not Virginia’s attorney general is pursuing ends other than the upholding of legal doctrine throughout the state, Virginia should pass laws to cover the protections he aims to take away. Steps are already being taken toward this end. Republican Governor Bob McDonnell has issued a directive banning state discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Virginia’s General Assembly and other legal bodies should follow his example and also uphold gay rights. The attorney general seems to be using this hot-button political issue to make a stand against important civil liberties protections, and the rest of the Commonwealth’s authorities need not allow him to do so.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the fall term the Harvard Republican Club took a trip to the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington D.C. At the conference HRC members met students from around the country, listened to speakers from a multitude of backgrounds, and were able to visit the nation’s capital. The CPAC trip gave a welcome breather from academics, helped to supplement the various government classes being offered at Harvard that many HRC members take, and allowed the HRC members to become better friends.
Taking such a break from campus life is highly unusual for today’s Harvard undergraduate, and this is a shame. In the past, the Harvard experience was mainly academic, leaving time for family visits and weekends off. However, today the experience is much more encompassing, and the 24/7 pressure inevitably affects student mental health. To remedy this, students should consider taking short, term-time vacations whenever possible. They are more feasible than many students realize, and the university calendar system provides ample time to recover from them.
Today, the College experience has become an extension of the constant ladder climbing that preceded admission. In pursuit of desirable post-graduation plans, students drive themselves relentlessly in multiple spheres—academic, extracurricular, and social. Although the College provides mental health services, and should of course continue to do so, these resources are not always enough.
Instead, at times when Harvard becomes overwhelming, students should take a short vacation. Harvard truly values travel, as can be clearly seen by the plethora of grants available to undergraduates. However, travel should not be limited to eight weeks over the summer or two weeks over J-Term. Instead, off-campus trips should be seen as a respite from daily life that is beneficial at any time.
Students may think that this time away from classes is academically deleterious, but this is a misconception. The university schedule makes it possible for the trips to be practical. Reading period allows students ample time to catch up on any reading they may have missed. It is a matter of using the time one has productively.
With better time management, students can surely carve out a weekend during a term to attend a conference that supplements their academic endeavors; visit a friend’s family, promoting student camaraderie; or simply take a trip. Teaching fellows and professors do not need to make exceptions for the academic responsibilities of students leaving for travel experiences because students are able to plan ahead, thanks to syllabi handed out at the beginning of the semester, well in advance of any due dates. Provided that teaching fellows and professors consistently follow the syllabi they provide, students are able to plan ahead responsibly. In any of these cases, planning ahead could make up the weekend of lost time for academics.
And as to whether it’s a good idea to encourage students to play hooky—yes, academics are the foremost priority at the College and students should dutifully attend to their studies as much as possible. But for the most part, students treat their work seriously and manage to turn in their work in a timely manner. In this context, a trip is an excellent formative experience that should not be discouraged, but rather promoted.
While the bygone era of Harvard as a country club cannot, and in some cases, should not come back in its entirety, the ability for students to take vacations during a term should be preserved. Harvardians are quite capable of planning their academic duties out for the future to make time for a vacation. After all, it was planning out one’s future that landed each Harvard man and woman at the College in the first place.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While advertisements on behalf of British Columbia attempt to remind television viewers of the Vancouver Olympics, public attention has moved on. Though this may come at the disappointment of hockey-crazed Canadians, the faded spotlight could not come more quickly for Russia. But as the host of the 2014 Winter Olympics, Russia will find it difficult to close the door on the glimpse Vancouver has provided of a fake superpower with an ego problem.
You can read about Russia’s resurgence each time Vladimir Putin makes a headline or a Russian billionaire purchases a sports team in the West. In the past year, I have debated the point with anyone who unwittingly mentions the apparent trend in my presence—from basketball fans to Harvard professors. I was most shaken by a discussion with the British journalist Alex Dryden a few months ago while interning for New York City’s National Public Radio station. While Dryden’s pseudo-fictional insights in "Red to Black" merit their own reading (know, at least, that Dryden uses a pseudonym to avoid prosecution by the Russian government), Dryden is just one of the more eloquent voices arguing that Russian authoritarianism never left the Kremlin.
The fall of the Soviet Union will remain a seminal moment in the lives of anyone alive in 1991, regardless of what happened afterward. Yet, 10 years removed from the hope of the 1990s, when Americans could still claim victory in the Cold War and point to a democratic Russia, such optimism provokes derision. Professors point to Gorbachev’s reforms and conclude that current violence against the press oppresses at levels unseen in the 80’s. In business circles, mention “Hermitage Capital Management” and “Russian capitalism” in the same sentence and see what happens. If anyone’s employer has a Moscow office, you will likely be rewarded with a tirade about financial bullying and fraud at the hands of the Russian government. Russian capitalism? The term was actually invented for a new reality television show about oligarchs who gossip with Putin and then buy English soccer teams.
Reality check time—the 2010 Winter Olympics. Vancouver might not have meant much to Americans in the scheme of things: Wall Street had a fling with curling; NBC bled money on Olympics coverage bought before the financial crisis. In Russia, however, the Olympics had a much more dramatic impact. Russia’s headlines cried foul as their country’s dominance of the games ended suddenly and in pathetic fashion.
The collapse of their Olympic juggernaut surprised and troubled many Russians. The aftermath, however, has revealed several gaping holes in the façade of a new era of Russian strength. President Dmitri Medvedev demonstrated petulance unbecoming of such a supposed giant. A Soviet-era leader, faced with such embarrassment, would have summarily sacked those involved—if not found them a new job opportunity in a small Siberian town. President Dmitri Medvedev’s public reaction, however, seems more like Hollywood parody of a Soviet response: Canceling his scheduled appearance at the closing ceremony, Medvedev announced, “[Those responsible] must have the courage to submit their resignation. And if they do not have this resolve, we will help them.” The president of the Olympic Committee and the deputy sports minister have both since resigned. Yet if Medvedev meant to show his control of the situation to his concerned citizens, why not simply fire the officials outright?
Instead, Medvedev seems to have consciously invoked the spirit of the Soviet autocrat and come up short. After Russia’s once invincible hockey team failed to earn a medal, the team’s coach, Vyacheslav Bykov, provided a bitter and ironic response to Medvedev’s posturing: “Let’s put up a bunch of guillotines and gallows. We have 35 people on the hockey team. Let’s go to Red Square and dispatch with them all.”
Bykov’s frustration, however, points to the real weakness Vancouver revealed—the collapse of Soviet-era infrastructure in modern Russia. The Soviet Union prioritized Olympic victories as public relations efforts. Substantial investments in coaching staff, training facilities, and athlete development from a young age would pay off in public relations success and the boost to the people’s morale as medals poured in. Since 1991, however, the new Russia has not sustained these programs. New facilities around Moscow have not functioned properly, and many farther from the capital have been abandoned.
The Vancouver games occurred 20 years after Soviet collapse, and athletes trained by the Soviet infrastructure are now too old to compete. One cannot argue that the new Russia simply doesn’t care—the government invested substantial sums in Vancouver, and failure there induced public dismay. Instead, failure has demonstrated that there can be no quick fix to the collapse of Soviet system infrastructure.
Russia vows to restore its Olympic image at the next Winter Olympics it will host in Sochi. Yet Sochi itself is an aging communist-era resort, and construction there has been condemned for its environmental damage. Do not expect a stunning reversal of fortunes on the podiums and in Russia’s image at Sochi. Instead, heed the warning of Vancouver—Russia’s crisis of identity and a collapsed infrastructure most likely transcend issues far more pressing than Olympic gold.

This past St. Patrick’s Day, Irish-Americans had extra cause for celebration. Early last month, the Northern Ireland Assembly unanimously approved legislation that will finally turn control of police and justice powers in the six counties of “Ulster” from Westminster to Belfast. By doing so, the body’s members resolved what many considered the final obstacle to implementation of the Good Friday Peace Accord of 1998—the agreement that ended a 30-year period of violent conflict that claimed the lives of more than 3,500 Catholics and Protestants. February’s agreement on “devolution” is a testament to the strength and perseverance of Northern Ireland’s political leaders and citizenry who, 12 years after reaching an initial agreement, have finally positioned themselves for a sustainable peace.
So, what lessons can be drawn from this remarkable achievement in peacemaking and conflict resolution? To what extent could those lessons inform the international community’s approach to issues like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict?
We spent several days in Belfast, Northern Ireland, interviewing people ranging from government officials to community organizers and cab drivers. In each of these conversations we asked a simple question: “What made the Northern Ireland peace process work?” Though the answers varied somewhat (often along sectarian lines), almost all agreed that the success of the Good Friday Peace Accord was the result of a combination of four key factors: courageous leadership by the relevant political parties, an inclusive negotiation framework that demanded commitment to a peaceful and democratic process, a strong public desire among Catholics and Protestants to see an end to violence, and the direct and unwavering support of the United States.
And what does this experience have to teach us about the conflict in the Middle East? Northern Ireland Secretary of State Shaun Woodward summed it up best when he said, “The Israelis and Palestinians should see from our example that it doesn’t have to be like this. If you work together, that which now seems impossible can be achieved.”
That promising message of hope carried us to Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories of the West Bank. There we found much the opposite of what we encountered in Northern Ireland. The dozens of Israelis we interviewed, whether they were members of the Knesset, academics, or local entrepreneurs, all communicated a depressing lack of hope about the prospects for a peace settlement. Their main explanation for this failure was that the Palestinian leadership was divided between Fatah in the West Bank and the “terrorist group” Hamas in Gaza. As one Knesset member put it, “We simply do not have a viable political partner in peace.”
In our interviews with Palestinians in the West Bank, we found equally pessimistic outlooks. Though the security situation seemed very much under control and the local economy was vibrant, no Palestinian we met believed that they would have an independent state of their own any time soon. As Issa Kassissieh of the Palestinian Authority Negotiations Affairs Department put it, “There is no hope. The state of Israel cannot see their interests and the Israelis are not ready for peace.” What people viewed as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s arrogant and stubborn leadership was often cited as a potentially insurmountable barrier to peace.
It is not clear that situation in the Holy Land has any of the four factors that were present in Ireland—particularly when it comes to political leadership and even-handed U.S. support (although the recent diplomatic quarreling between Israel and the U.S. and the calls for a settlement freeze suggest this may change). It is also evident that the Israelis have gotten comfortable with the status quo, and the U.S. and Europe must take measures to change that.  The spark to that change can begin with the 42 million members of the Irish-American community. Irish-Americans should unite as they did during the 1990s, this time in opposition to Israel’s illegal occupation of Palestinian territories, and call on the U.S. government to put more pressure on Israel to freeze settlement expansion and come to the negotiating table. Irish-American community leaders should also reach out to the Israeli, Jewish, Arab, and Palestinian diaspora groups in the U.S. to impart the lessons they learned in the 1990s and bring the parties together.
The EU also has a greater role to play in mediating this conflict. Imagine if a small group of its more powerful states got together and proposed fast-tracked EU and NATO membership for Israel, provided it negotiates a two-state solution and comes into compliance with international law. The promise of such memberships and the economic opportunities and security guarantees that come with them just might put enough positive pressure on Israel to do the right thing.  Should the Israelis fail to take action, the EU would then need to consider punitive trade sanctions similar to those imposed on South Africa during its apartheid era in the 1980s. The message to Israel must be clear: We want to help you, but the status quo is unacceptable.
Twelve years ago Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland ended a conflict that many said was irreconcilable. As Irish-Americans celebrated St. Patrick’s Day last week and continue to celebrate the remarkable peace achieved on the Emerald Isle, it is important that we all remember the lessons that made that peace possible and how they can be applied to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve a lasting peace of their own.

Sir Ronald M. Cohen, co-founder and former chairman of Apax Partners, will deliver the keynote address to Harvard Business School graduates on Class Day, scheduled for May 26, the HBS Student Association announced earlier this month.
Cohen, who graduated from HBS in 1969, currently serves as chairman of The Portland Trust, a British foundation he established in 2003 that seeks to bring peace between the Palestinians and Israelis through economic development in the private sector.
In 1972, Cohen and three of his HBS classmates co-founded Apax Partners, which has become one of the world’s predominant private equity advisory firms over the last 30 years.
“He’s been one of the groundbreakers in the venture capital and private equity industry,” said Jamie D. Chang, HBS Class Day Committee co-chair. “It’s very relevant to the Business School.”
Chang said that Cohen’s work with The Portland Trust is exemplary of HBS’ focus on effecting social change through entrepreneurship, as showcased in the School’s recent Social Enterprise Initiative—a project founded in 1993 that emphasizes individual and organizational contributions to social improvement.
“I think that’s a good message to Business School students: to use the skills they’ve developed for broader societal benefit,” Chang said.
“The mission of the School has always been to create responsible leaders who make a difference in the world—helping business students connect to social enterprise,” Chang said.
Cohen is a member of the Harvard Board of Overseers—the University’s second-highest governing body—and the Board of Dean’s Advisers at HBS. He is also a recipient of the HBS Alumni Achievement Award.
In 2007, Cohen published “The Second Bounce of the Ball: Turning Risk into Opportunity,” a book about the principles of entrepreneurship.
Cohen was chosen as the Class Day speaker by the HBS graduating class in a class-wide vote last fall, according to Chang.
“It’s hard to please 900 people. We’re doing the best we can,” Chang said.
“We’re just excited for [Cohen’s] broader appeal as a great speaker. We’re happy to have him here,” he added.

Harvard has begun planning for its next capital campaign, University President Drew G. Faust said in an interview earlier this month, after over five years of delays caused by turmoil within the University and in the larger economic landscape.
Over the coming months, the University’s planning effort will identify projects and themes that Faust said she hopes will excite donors. The University has not yet set a firm date for the launch of the campaign.
“We want to align our sense of what is most important to us with what we think we can raise money for,” Faust said.
Capital campaigns for major non-profits typically span several years and begin securing donation pledges before the campaign is publicly launched, sometimes raising upwards of 40 percent of the campaign’s net commitments in the so-called “quiet phase” of fundraising. The University has appointed Jennifer Pachus, a former FAS associate dean for development, as executive director of the upcoming capital campaign.
Harvard’s last capital campaign, which raised $2.6 billion ($3.2 billion in today’s dollars), ended nearly 10 years ago in 2001, but the University has repeatedly decided to postpone a new campaign in recent years.
The lack of a permanent University President and central administration staff in 2006 led officials to delay the launch of a campaign, as the president’s vision is crucial to determining the direction of large fundraising drives. In the past two years, the campaign was again pushed back due to the economic downturn that saw the University endowment contract by 27.3 percent in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2009.
Administrators will take into account the impact of last year’s recession on donors when determining fundraising goals, Faust said. But given the time elapsed since the last capital campaign, the University needs to move forward on a capital campaign despite recent economic turbulence, she added.
“It’s been 10 years since Harvard ended its last campaign,” Faust said. “That’s a very long time to go between campaigns. It’s really time for us to be assessing how we are going to be moving into this.”
Large campaigns like the 2001 effort represent an opportunity for University Presidents to lay out their vision for the University’s future in the hope that donors will agree to fund that effort­—an experience that can define the president’s tenure.
According to Faust, major capital campaigns are beneficial for the University not only because they raise funds, but also because they force administrators to set priorities.
Leaders within the University must choose programs to emphasize that can garner the support of the alumni community—a type of austerity measure that Faust said would strengthen the University.
In the long term, capital campaigns also renew alumni bonds to Harvard through the course of the planning and organizational process, which leads to an increase in overall giving after the end of the campaign, according to Faust.

The Harvard Corporation—the University’s top governing body, which has long faced intense criticism for its lack of transparency—has begun an internal review of its governance policies and increased its interaction with the Board of Overseers.
The increased interaction with the Board is largely unprecedented in the history of the two bodies, said one Overseer. The Board of Overseers, composed of elected Harvard alumni who serve in an advisory capacity, is the University’s second highest governing body.
The Corporation’s internal review, which may result in increased transparency, centers around the Corporation’s relationship with the Board of Overseers. The Corporation is known for its high level of secrecy and does not release agendas nor minutes for its meetings.
University President Drew G. Faust said in an interview earlier this month that the review will also examine how the Corporation sets its agenda, how it interacts to the community, and how it determines the scope of its responsibilities. But it is unclear whether the review will result in further changes in the Corporation’s functions.
The Corporation—which has traditionally interacted only nominally with the Overseers—has improved communication with the Board in recent years, according to three Overseers who all asked to remain anonymous in order to preserve their relationship with the Corporation. Most Overseers declined to be interviewed for this article or did not return requests for comment.
As part of a package of reforms introduced several years ago under Corporation senior fellow James R. Houghton ’58 that have intensified recently, Corporation members have begun attending Overseers’ plenary meetings and have solicited input from Overseers on issues they would like to include on the Corporation’s meeting agenda, according to two Overseers.
Corporation members have also been making individual phone calls to Overseers in order to consult with them on the ongoing search for a new member of the Corporation after Houghton retired late last year.
The seven-member Corporation has largely retained the same structure since 1640. Members still serve for life and wield great influence over the University’s direction. Most importantly, the Corporation has sole hiring and firing power over University presidents, an important role in an era when Harvard’s presidents have served as public figures.
The internal governance review comes in the face of mounting criticism against the organization for its structure.
In a scathing Boston Globe op-ed, former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 and engineering Professor Frederick H. Abernathy labeled the Corporation “a dangerous anachronism” and argued that it is “too small, too closed, and too secretive to be intensely self-critical, as any responsible board must be.”
Abernathy and Lewis said that much of the Corporation’s problems are “structural” and, until the organization undergoes reform, the Corporation will only share power voluntarily with the “powerless” Overseers.
In recent months, the Corporation appears to have taken steps in that direction, though it remains unclear, one Overseer says, what effect the Corporation’s interactions with the Overseers have on its decision making.
It is also unclear whether recent changes in the Corporation’s operating structure, which Faust contends began several years ago during Houghton’s tenure, are part of the Corporation’s governance review.
According to Faust, the Corporation has expanded its interactions with the Overseers during the past several years, noting that Overseers served on the presidential search committee that selected her.
She also said that regularly scheduled meetings take place between the Overseers’ executive committee and the Corporation.
But now, Faust said, is an excellent time to re-examine that effort.
“This is a time when everyone in the University is scrutinizing everything,” Faust said. “It seemed like a good time for the Corporation to ask these questions.”
When asked if she thought there existed a need for increased transparency on the Corporation, Faust declined to take a clear stand.
“I think there’s an opportunity for communication that we want to take advantage of,” Faust said, clarifying that the opportunity lay between the governing boards and the community.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
(Part II of this story appeared on March 23, 2010.)
Thirty years ago, cheating required work. Students had to go to the stacks, pore over academic texts, and manually copy the information to plagiarize a paper.
But with the advent of smart phones and easy access to the Internet, technology has blurred the lines of what constitutes blatant academic dishonesty as opposed to improper attribution, for example.
As a result of the past decade’s technological advancements, cheating has become more difficult to identify and assess, and professors have grown increasingly reluctant to turn cases over to the Administrative Board—Harvard College’s disciplinary body—stating that the punitive measures are too inflexible.
In light of the growing disconnect between faculty and the Ad Board, some administrators worry that many cases of academic dishonesty are not reported or even identified.
“There’s ample reason to think we have a real problem,” says Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris. “We certainly assume that the cases that are brought to the Ad Board are the tip of the iceberg.”
Administrators say they are taking preventative steps to improve how the College educates students about academic dishonesty, including reworking “Writing with Sources”—a text used in Expository Writing 20—and encouraging all departments to teach proper citation in sophomore tutorials.
“A lot of faculty just assume students know things that we’ve never actually taught them,” Harris says, such as appropriate forms of collaboration and citation.
Given the widespread dissatisfaction among faculty, administrators, and students, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds took steps to address the root of their complaints—the rigidity of the Ad Board’s process for handling cases of academic dishonesty.
Hammonds called on the Faculty of Arts and Sciences to create “a new process for adjudicating academic dishonesty cases that would expand the options for disciplinary sanctions,” as recommended in the Committee to Review the Administrative Board’s report released by Hammonds on March 10.
A FAIR PUNISHMENT
Pforzheimer House Resident Dean Lisa Boes—who, like all resident deans, sits on the Ad Board—says that from her experience, faculty members will sometimes choose to handle cases of academic dishonesty themselves as they feel the College’s disciplinary actions may be too severe.
These instances are “widespread,” Boes says, and College administrators worry that inconsistent handling of academic dishonesty cases is unfair and results in uneven outcomes.
“If somebody’s required to withdraw for a year, and somebody else gets a zero on one paper which gets averaged in with a bunch of things [and] you end up with a C in a class, that’s an enormous gap and that’s just not equitable,” Harris says.
Much of the faculty’s dissatisfaction comes from the limited range of responses the Ad Board is allowed to consider when hearing academic dishonesty cases.
Currently, the most common outcome in a case of academic dishonesty is “required withdrawal” for two semesters, with over one-third of cases in the past five years resulting in this decision, which mandates that students leave campus and find work.
Disciplinary probation—during which the College closely monitors student behavior—ranks next, with 28 percent of students in the last five years who went before the Ad Board receiving this decision.
The remaining options, none of which carry any serious repercussions, are “admonish,” “take no action,” and “scratch.”
David J. Malan ’99, who teaches the popular introductory course Computer Science 50, says he thinks that these existing Ad Board responses do not provide enough flexibility. For some cases of academic dishonesty, Malan says he thinks that removing a student from the course might be a more “proportional” response than requiring withdrawal.
When deciding whether to send a student to the Ad Board, many professors are cognizant of the most likely outcome—required withdrawal.
“There are times when [professors] may conclude—and we don’t know this, that’s the thing—that it is plagiarism, or it is inappropriate collaboration, and they just deal with it [themselves],” Harris says. “They’re not supposed to do that.”
A TWO-TRACK SOLUTION
To address the Faculty’s concerns that the Ad Board’s disciplinary actions cannot adequately address the range of academic dishonesty cases, the Committee to Review the Ad Board recommends creating a new process that would increase the range of disciplinary responses available.
Faculty and teaching staff would be encouraged to report every case to the Ad Board, as per current policy.
For students who have already faced formal charges in the past, the case would automatically be forwarded to the Ad Board for review.
For students who have not been previously reported for academic dishonesty, two courses of action are possible. If the student denies the charges, the student would be required to appear before the Ad Board. Otherwise, the Secretary of the Ad Board—currently John “Jay” L. Ellison—would meet with the course professor, who would determine whether the case should be sent to the Ad Board or handled with punishments such as mandatory tutoring, a course warning, or a graded penalty.
The proposed two-track solution could help ease faculty apprehensions about turning students over to the board, and administrators say the solution may provide more flexibility in handling cases. Members of the Ad Board have raised concerns that it can be difficult to administer disciplinary action proportional to the degree of infraction or address the nuances of individual cases given the limited options.
“The range of cases we see only seems to be getting larger, and the kinds of responses that feel fair are very wide-ranging,” said Adams House Resident Dean Sharon L. Howell. “There’s a kind of restrictiveness at the moment.”
One junior, who was required to withdraw from the College for two semesters in January for using verbatim and near-verbatim quotations in a paper draft without proper attribution, says she believes the punishment she received was too harsh.
“The punishment I got for doing something like that on a draft of a paper was pretty extreme because that’s the same punishment someone would have gotten if they had bought a paper online and used it for their final paper,” says the junior, who asked to remain anonymous in order to avoid the stigma associated with being forced to withdraw.
BROADER CONVERSATION
Even if the Faculty passes the committee’s recommendations this year, College administrators are looking to start broader conversations about the meaning of integrity and academic dishonesty at the College.
Next year, administrators hope to bring in a “management fellow” to study how peer institutions handle academic dishonesty as well as “lay the groundwork for us to have a bigger discussion in the Faculty about the academic dishonesty rules,” Ellison says.
Harris adds that he expects to see the creation of a new committee to explore other issues relating to academic dishonesty, such as the implementation of an honor code.
“It’s a moment to really revisit the way in which we are instructing students about respect for intellectual property,” Harris says. “Some of the certitude surrounding intellectual property is breaking down, and scholarship cannot flourish in a world in which integrity is absent or diminished.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although Ivy League play has just begun, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team took an important step Saturday afternoon toward securing itself a spot in the Ancient Eight tournament at season’s end.
The Crimson (3-3, 1-1 Ivy), which entered the season predicted to finish fifth in the conference standings, upended Cornell (2-4, 1-1), the team predicted to finish fourth, in a 10-4 victory at Harvard Stadium, moving the Crimson one step closer to earning one of four playoff berths.
Harvard controlled the tempo from the onset and, with strong defense, held the Big Red scoreless for the game’s first 39 minutes—allowing the home team to grab a commanding 6-0 lead.
Cornell’s offense woke up in the final period, as attacker Jessi Steinberg scored three straight goals for the Big Red in less than five minutes, but the Crimson responded by holding the visitors scoreless for the next 10 minutes.
“I think when we lose our legs a little bit, we slow down, but it’s to be expected, and they finished the game,” Harvard coach Lisa Miller said. “There was a point there where they could have been like, ‘Uh oh,’ and I don’t think they [panicked]. They finished the game, which is a good thing for us.”
Despite facing double teams throughout the contest, freshman Jennifer VanderMeulen still managed to lead the Crimson attack once again, netting three goals to push her team-leading total to 20.
“[Facing double teams] gives you more drive to go to the goal,” VanderMeulen said. “I think it’s kind of like a pride thing, where you don’t want to let someone stand you up, so you work harder to get by them.”
Classmates Danielle Tetreault and Cyr each chipped in with one goal apiece, while sophomore Tyler Petropulos added two.
Tetreault notched her team’s first goal, scoring off a free-position shot on Harvard’s first possession. After winning the match’s opening draw control, the Crimson slowed it down on offense, working the ball around the perimeter and behind its opponent’s goal. Harvard’s first two shots failed to hit their target, but Tetreault’s attempt found the back of the net.
“We’re trying to work on [slowing down the offense],” Miller said. “I think our first five games were [characterized by] youthful exuberance. It was like we would race to the cage and might not take the quality shot that you want or might generate a turnover.”
After Harvard senior goalie Katherine Martino came up with her first of eight saves in the contest on the visiting team’s first possession, the Crimson offense was back on the attack again.
This time, VanderMeulen took it herself up the middle, shooting it low past Big Red goalkeeper Kyla Dambach.
The teams traded shots over the next 10 minutes of play, but the Crimson’s aggressive defense disrupted Cornell and forced the Big Red to commit six first-half turnovers.
Co-captain Sara Flood broke the scoring drought with 8:02 left in the period, cutting across the middle and finishing a pass from sophomore Melanie Baskind. Baskind nearly recorded her second assist of the contest moments later when she found rookie Alexis Dal Col open in front of the net, but the freshman’s shot was deflected away by Dambach.
The Crimson scored twice more before the halftime buzzer sounded, courtesy of VanderMeulen and Petropulos. VanderMeulen bounced home a free position shot for her second score of the game, while Petropulos used a spin move to break down her defender and find an open path to the cage.
With those scores, Harvard led 5-0 at the break, marking the first time this season that Cornell failed to score in the opening frame.
“I thought [the defenders] did their job,” Miller said. “[Junior] Sam McMahon did a really good job on [attacker Libby Johnson], turning her down and just containing her. They worked together really well.”
While the Crimson struck first in the second, the Big Red did not give up without a fight, responding with a 3-1 run to cut Harvard’s lead to four.
But the Crimson’s defense clamped down from there, and Cyr iced the game with 4:45 left, when she cut up the middle alone and netted her first career goal.
Cornell added one final score, but its total output of four was the lowest surrendered by Harvard since Mar. 18, 2007.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After starting 4-1 for the third-straight season, the No. 11 Harvard men’s lacrosse team still had a lingering question: would it be able to finally make the next step and compete regularly with the likes of Brown, Cornell, and Princeton?
That question remains unanswered.
Despite a gutsy second-half comeback, the Crimson (4-2, 0-1 Ivy) continued its struggles against the class of Ivy League lacrosse, falling to the No. 17 Bears (3-1, 1-0) in both squads’ Ivy opener, 13-11.
“It was pretty disappointing, considering this was a really big game for us,” sophomore Jeff Cohen said. “We really struggled with clearing, but that being said, we did do some things well. We worked hard, and we definitely didn’t give up. We did fight back.”
Junior attack Dean Gibbons opened the scoring when he rolled behind the goal and swept the ball under Brown goalie Matt Chriss to put Harvard ahead, 1-0, at the 10:21 mark of the first quarter.
The Bears responded five minutes later when Carey Collins rifled one from 10 yards out past sophomore goalie Christian Coates. Just 24 seconds later, Coates tried to clear, but his long pass was intercepted, and Brown’s quick offense rode a fast break to take its first lead of the game, 2-1.
The Bears would rattle off four straight goals—including three within one minute—to take a 6-1 lead less than a minute into the second quarter.  Coates was pulled in favor of freshman Harry Krieger after allowing five goals and recording only one save in the first frame.
“It was a disappointing first quarter, because I thought we got the better of the play for the majority of the quarter,” Crimson coach John Tillman said. “They got the better of the play in ground balls and faceoffs, and that’s a lot of extra possessions. It’s hard to give that many opportunities to a good team like Brown.”
Sophomore Terry White broke the Bears’ run with his sixth goal of the season only to have Brown’s Thomas Muldoon respond with his second goal of the game two minutes later.  Krieger would settle down between the pipes and make two impressive point-blank saves while Cohen and sophomore Kevin Vaughan each notched unassisted goals to bring Harvard within three at halftime, 7-4.
Early in the third quarter, co-captain Travis Burr found White for his second goal of the game, cutting the Crimson’s deficit to two.
But the Bears’ speed and command of the faceoffs would prove the difference over the remainder of the quarter as Brown would score four of the game’s next five goals to take an 11-6 lead near the end of the third frame.
Cohen’s second goal of the day in the first minute of the fourth quarter would narrow the score to 11-8. The Bears never faltered though, coming right back to extend the lead to four with only 10 minutes left in the contest.
“Offensively we did some things well,” Cohen said. “We have to keep working hard, getting ground balls, and we have to finish our chances better on offense.”
White’s fourth goal of the game just 90 seconds after Cohen’s third closed the gap to 12-10.  Brown’s defense started to get a little bit rattled, and Cohen took advantage when he brought the goalie out of position behind the goal and ran around the crease to bounce it in just above the recovering Chriss.
With just over a minute left, Chriss took the ball all the way down the field untouched and got off a shot that went past Krieger as he fell to the ground.  Chriss was ruled in the crease when he shot, and the goal was nullified—giving Harvard one last chance to equalize with 1:46 left on the clock.  The Crimson was never able to control possession in the waning minutes of the game, and Andrew Feinberg’s goal with 53 seconds left sealed the 13-11 victory for the Bears.
“We knew this wasn’t going to be easy,” Tillman said. “But I really believe in this group. They really care about each other, and there’s a lot of potential out there. I’m excited to see how good they can get.”
Overall, Harvard was only able to convert 19 of 26 clear opportunities and won a season-low 40 percent of its faceoffs. The Crimson outshot Brown, 39-32, but was dominated on the ground balls, 35-24. Krieger stepped up to record nine saves in goal and kept Harvard competitive throughout the game.
“We thought Christian did a great job [against Colgate] and that he earned the right to start today,” Tillman said. “We were disappointed he didn’t have the start we thought he would have, but I thought Harry stepped up and gave us an emotional lift when we really needed it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard concluded its spring break trip on Saturday by taking on Fresno State in Fresno, Calif. In decisive fashion, the No. 51 Crimson women’s tennis team (8-6) swept its matches from the Bulldogs (0-12) to win, 7-0.
“Today’s match went very well,” Harvard coach Traci Green said. “We competed very well as a team, top-to-bottom.”
“I’m really proud of the way we stuck together and stayed mentally tough,” the coach added.
It was the team’s first shutout victory since it opened its spring season against Boston University in January.
“Everyone fought really hard today…We’ve been working really hard at practice,” freshman Hideko Tachibana said. “It’s finally paying off.”
Harvard began the afternoon by winning two of the three doubles matches to take the doubles point for the first time in four contests.
Sophomore Holly Cao and junior captain Samantha Rosekrans delivered an 8-3 win in the top doubles spot, while Tachibana and freshman Kristin Norton clinched the point with an 8-6 victory.
“We had a lot of energy,” Tachibana said of her doubles match. “We started off really well.”
“We were working on trying to close in and come to the net,” she added. “It was a tough match, and we pulled it out.”
After doubles play concluded, sophomore Sam Gridley set the tone for the singles round with a 6-3, 6-0 win in her first action of the road trip.
“She stepped in there at No. 6 today and was fired up from the very beginning,” Green said. “She fought all the way through and came through for the victory.”
Tachibana started off slowly at No. 2, dropping her first set 6-2.
Not one to go quietly, she fought her way to quick 6-1 wins in the second and third sets to give Harvard its third point of the afternoon and put it one away from clinching the match.
“I was not as prepared as I should have been,” Tachibana said. “But I stayed tough to pull out the second and third sets.”
Following Tachibana’s example, classmate Norton stayed strong through a close match. Norton won her first set handily, but the second set was neck-and-neck.
It eventually went into a tiebreak in which the Crimson rookie earned a tight victory to seal the fourth team point, 6-2, 7-6 (7-4). Norton improves to 9-4 this year at No. 3.
“Kristin Norton clinched the match for us,” Green said. “We are really excited about coming away with the win.”
The matches following the decisive effort were no less exciting, as Harvard battled for every point it could get.
Rosekrans began her match against Melissa McQueen with a quick 6-2 victory but lost the second set by the same margin, pushing the match into a decisive third set.
But the captain was able to return to her winning ways in the final set to earn another 6-2 victory.
“It was a really exciting, back-and-forth match,” Green said. “Her opponent was playing really well, but Sam took control of the third set.”
No. 54 Cao improved to 10-2 at No. 1 this season with a 6-2, 7-5 win.
“Holly Cao is one of a kind,” Green said. “She’s been playing well.”
Cao missed the opportunity to play Fresno State’s top player, No. 10 Anastasia Petukhova, who has been out with an injury for the past month.
To complete the Crimson’s shutout, freshman Alexandra Lehman faced a tough match at No. 5, where she played for the first time this season. After winning the first set, 6-2, she dropped the next one, 6-3.
In the final set, with the score tied 5-5, Lehman won the next two games to claim the victory.
“She was using a lot of energy out there,” Green said. “Her mental toughness really pulled her through.”
Leaving California with a 2-1 record, Harvard will come home to begin Ivy League play beginning on Apr. 2.
“[The trip] was great for our squad,” Green said. “I think everyone improved. We will try to build on that momentum in the Ivy season.”
“We’re all really pumped up for the Ivies,” Tachibana said. “I think we’re ready.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the Harvard softball team, a trip to California didn’t bring much fun in the sun.
Playing against some of its stiffest competition of the season, the Crimson (4-12) dropped five games at the San Diego Classic II at the USD Softball Complex this weekend.
“We didn’t feel defeated by these losses,” sophomore pitcher Rachel Brown said. “We knew these were going to be tough teams…They were scheduled to make us better. And instead of playing easier teams, we wanted to play good competition and get ready for Ivies.”
Harvard’s pitchers kept many of the games close, as the squad dropped a pair of decisions by a single run, but a lack of timely hitting prevented the Crimson from coming away with wins.
“I think we’re definitely feeling like we’re hitting our stride,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said. “We’re just trying to polish ourselves and work on getting those timely hits.”
SAN DIEGO STATE 4, HARVARD 0
The Crimson bats were again quiet in the squad’s final game of the weekend, as Harvard mustered just five singles in a 4-0 loss to San Diego State (18-8).
Freshman pitcher Jessica Ferri kept the Aztecs—now on a 10-game win streak—quiet through the first four innings before allowing two runs in the fifth on a walk and a pair of singles, aided by two stolen bases.
San Diego State padded its lead in the sixth, as co-captain Margaux Black allowed a fielder’s choice and a single that, combined with an error, put two more runs on the board.
“Our goal on Sunday was to be clean on defense, and we made one throwing error in 14 innings of play,” Allard said. “We had great at-bats—what we lacked was just getting the hits when we needed them.”
LONG BEACH STATE 1, HARVARD 0
Earlier on Saturday, the Crimson lost a 1-0 pitcher’s duel to Long Beach State (13-13).
49ers pitcher Brooke Turner allowed just two Harvard hits and didn’t allow a runner past second in a complete-game shutout.
Brown pitched three dominant innings—allowing just one hit—before yielding to Black in the fourth.
“Margaux Black really came on and was really effective for us in a few of these games this weekend,” Allard said. “It was great to see her hold some of those great-hitting teams [quiet]…Our pitchers were really stepping up, and I could see their confidence increasing.”
Long Beach State would finally mount an offensive rally in the sixth, as Caitrin DeBaun plated the game’s only run with a single through the right side.
NO. 20 TEXAS A&M 10, HARVARD 1
No. 20 Texas A&M (26-6) was too much for the Crimson to handle in Friday’s nightcap, as the Aggies slugged their way to a 10-1 win.
Brown shut Texas A&M down through four innings, allowing just three baserunners, before breaking down in the fifth. The Aggies launched a pair of long balls to plate six runs in the inning and scored four more off Black in the sixth.
“Although the score kind of shows a lopsided game, we stuck with them for four innings, and it was exciting to see that we could stick with that team,” Brown said. “It was very cool for us to play against these nationally-ranked teams. It shows we’re all playing the same game, and we can compete with them.”
Harvard was able to string some hits together in the bottom of the sixth, with co-captain Melissa Schellberg, who is also a Crimson sports editor, driving in her team’s only run with an infield single. But sophomore Jane Alexander struck out with the bases loaded to end the Crimson rally.
KANSAS 9, HARVARD 1
Kansas (14-15) torched Harvard, 9-1, in Friday’s opener, a run-rule game that wrapped up in five innings.
The Jayhawks struck early with four runs in the first and never looked back, plating a run in four out of the five frames.
The Crimson got its only run of the game in the top of the fourth, when sophomore Whitney Shaw and Alexander strung together back-to-back doubles.
SAN DIEGO 3, HARVARD 2
San Diego (8-15) rallied from a 2-0 hole to top Harvard, 3-2, in Thursday’s opener.
Torero Celeste Soto drove in the game-winner with a single in the top of the seventh, spoiling Brown’s complete-game, nine-strikeout performance.
The Crimson started the tournament with a bang, as Brown struck out the side in the first and senior Jen Francis blasted a two-run dinger in the bottom of the inning.
But from there, Harvard’s offense struggled, leaving at least one runner on base in the second, third, and fourth before San Diego’s Jennifer Ellenbeck closed out her complete game with three perfect innings.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In “The Bug,” Mary Chapin Carpenter sings, “Sometimes you’re the Louisville Slugger. Sometimes you’re the ball.”
Against Charlotte this past weekend, the Harvard baseball team (3-10) was the ball. The 49ers (11-5) scored more runs in each of the first two games than the Crimson was able to score all weekend, as Charlotte took three straight victories in Charlotte, N.C.
“I thought Charlotte was a much stronger ballclub than us,” Crimson coach Joe Walsh said. “That was reflected in the scores. Teams down here in Carolina are very good.
We’ve got a long way to go before we can compete with them.”
CHARLOTTE 4, HARVARD 1
The third time wasn’t quite the charm for the Crimson, but Harvard’s defense stepped up yesterday, allowing a little over a sixth of the offensive production it had given up the day before.
“I thought it was good that we bounced back a little,” sophomore Marcus Way said. “Defense made some really good plays. I was really pleased. It was a good one to end on.”
With Way on the mound, the Crimson held the 49ers scoreless in the first three innings before finally surrendering a run in fourth.
“We had a very well-pitched game,” Walsh said.
Soon after, Harvard picked up a run of its own when junior Sean O’Hara knocked in classmate Dillon O’Neill to even the score at 1-1.
But after Way left the mound after the fifth, sophomore Will Keuper took the ball and found that the Charlotte batters had a few runs left in them. Keuper allowed two runs in his lone inning of work.
By that point the Crimson bats—which had reached double digits in runs the day before—had dried out. Harvard’s offense was unable to solve 49ers pitcher Kelly McLain, who picked up the save in Charlotte’s third-straight win.
CHARLOTTE 18, HARVARD 10
Crimson freshman Kyle Larrow picked the wrong day to hit his first collegiate home run and pick up his first three RBI. Had he held off his offensive outburst until Sunday, the Crimson might have been able to head home with a victory.
Unfortunately for Harvard, the Crimson’s best showing at the plate of the season came on a day when its opponents hit the voting age in runs—half of which were scored in the third inning.
Before the third, Harvard had jumped out to an early lead when junior catcher Tyler Albright scored off a single from junior right fielder Joey Smith in the top of the second. But the 49ers soon changed the tone of the game, after Charlotte scored nine runs in the bottom of the third inning. First baseman Ryan Rivers was the first to strike, sending center fielder Cory Tilton home to put his team on the scoreboard. Rivers soon crossed the plate off a wild pitch from sophomore Brent Suter. Suter allowed seven runs before he was replaced by Matt Doyle. The freshman allowed two more runs before 49ers’ designated hitter Zane Williams struck out swinging.
“[Suter] pitched really well in the first two innings,” Walsh said. “He’s had some back issues, and it kind of stiffened up.”
The Crimson responded with a two-run inning in the top of the fourth, but soon after Charlotte responded with three-run innings in the fifth and sixth, effectively neutralizing Harvard’s six runs in the seventh inning and sending the Crimson to its second loss of the weekend.
CHARLOTTE 15, HARVARD 3
First is the worst.
So goes the popular, if cruel, children’s rhyme, and the 49ers certainly schooled the Crimson on Friday. The 12-run loss was Harvard’s worst of the season.
Unlike the final two games of the series, Charlotte wasted no time getting on the board, kicking off its abuse of junior pitcher Eric Eadington with two runs in the first inning. By the time Eadington left the mound, the 49ers were already up 8-2.
“[The 49ers] have a terrific offensive lineup,” Walsh said. “We got behind guys, walked guys, and every time we did, they punished us for it.”
Meanwhile, Harvard had already put together nearly all of the scoring it was going to get, though Smith scored an unearned run in eighth inning.
“We had an opportunity to play a really good team in Charlotte University,” Way said. “It was a tough break but I think we showed progress. I think we’re going to be really good.”

In track and field, winning the top three spots in an event is hard to do. Grabbing spots one through five in an event is even harder. Claiming the top five in one event and then the top four in another is even more impressive.
For the Harvard men’s and women’s track and field teams, last Friday was a day to impress. The Crimson squads came ready to race at the Texas Southern Relays this past weekend in Houston, grabbing medals in nine different events before rain caused the meet to finish a day early.
“I thought we had a great spring break,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “We got in some really good training, working hard and getting a lot of good things accomplished, and then we had a good Friday at the TSU relays.”
After spending a week training at Rice University, the women’s distance squad was more than ready on Friday. In one of the first races of the day—the women’s 3000-meter event—a pack of Harvard runners took the lead from the start, refusing to relinquish its position. Junior Claire Richardson crossed the line first with a time of 9:59.33, followed four seconds later by Crimson sophomore Nicole Cochran. Sophomore Jeanne Mack and juniors Hilary May and Jamie Olson grabbed the third through fifth positions. Fifteen more seconds lapsed before a runner from a different team reached the finish.
The men’s side had similar success in the 3000-meter race, claiming the top four spots. Freshman Jeremy Gilmour grabbed first place with a time of 8:35.39, two tenths of a second ahead of classmate Phil Galebach. Sophomores Dan Stiles and Michael Hoffman were right behind, placing third and fourth.
“To see [the distance runners] go out and dominate the field like that, I was very pleased,” Saretsky said.
In addition to the distance wins, the women’s 4x800 relay team saw success as the sophomore quartet of Magda Robak, Shannon Conway, Lauren Leon and Alison Lee took second place with a time of 9:20.59 behind Alabama State.
“The 4x400 team ran the 4x800 race and they were right in it the entire time,” Olson said. “It was pretty impressive since they normally run 400s. They did really well. In the last two laps it was just them and Alabama [State].”
Members of both sides also took victories despite competing outdoors for the first time this year. Sophomore Robbie Paris won the 400-meter hurdles in the third of five sections with a time of 56.85, while his classmate and counterpart on the women’s side, Kim O’Donnell, placed second by two tenths of a second in her section.
As Harvard’s track team handled the competition, the field squad was equally successful. On the men’s side, senior Jack Brady won the hammer throw with a mark of 56.35 meters, followed by junior Eric Clayman, who grabbed third place. The Crimson also took first and third place in the javelin throw. The women’s field events featured Harvard taking three second-place finishes. Junior Dina Emde jumped 1.65 meters in the high jump for the silver, while freshman Sydnie Leroy placed second in the pole vault. Senior Jessica Fronk rounded out the trio, finishing second in the javelin throw.
With all of the triumphs, the only damper of the week came when race officials decided to cancel Saturday’s races due to strong rain.
“The [athletes] were definitely disappointed,” Saretsky said. “They were looking forward to competing, but it’s one of the things we talk about—focusing on what you can control as an athlete, and you can’t control the weather.”
Saretsky added that despite the bad weather, Friday’s victories proved that the team will have more success to come, including next weekend’s events at the Stanford Invitational and the Central Florida Invitational.
“Fortunately we have a number of weekends coming up for other opportunities to turn in some good performances,” Saretsky said. “It should be a fun season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past weekend, co-captain Alexandra Clarke accomplished a feat that hasn’t been achieved by a female Harvard swimmer in nearly four years: she secured All-American status with a stellar 16th-place finish at the NCAA Women’s Swimming and Diving Championships at University Aquatic Center in Minneapolis, Minn.
The last female Crimson swimmer to earn the distinction was Noelle Bassi ‘07 in the 200-yard butterfly in 2005 and 2006.
But Clarke shined in the 1,650-yard freestyle as she has her entire career, clocking in at 16:10.25 and breaking her previous school record.
Breaking into the top 16 of the race was no guarantee for Clarke entering Saturday morning. The 1,650 is unique in that the players only get to swim once, as opposed to other races that involve a preliminary round prior to the final race. Her fate thus rested on a single thrust of energy.
“After I finished my heat, it became a waiting game [to see how opponents from other heats were going to perform],” Clarke said. “There were three girls who had beaten me earlier by less than a second, so I was really nervous to see how they would do.”
The star athlete’s adrenaline promptly kicked in, and she was able to edge out a talented group of swimmers to clinch the 16th—and final—All-American spot.
“Ali and I have swam at NCAAs for three years now, and we even went to Olympic trials together,” junior teammate Kate Mills said. “I’ve seen how she’s worked so hard both in and out of the pool. She totally deserves her success, and it was very special that she was able to accomplish this goal in her final meet. She just put it all out there at the very end.”
Attaining All-American status was only the crowning jewel on the co-captain’s already-decorated college career. The Phoenix, Ariz. native has received the Sharon Beckman Award, given to Harvard’s most outstanding swimmer, for two consecutive seasons. In her main event—the 1,650 free—Clarke has posted top-30 finishes at the NCAA championships all four years. Although she is the first female Crimson swimmer to gain All-American status since 2006, Clarke is the first to specifically do so in the 1,650 in over 18 years.
“I’m definitely happy about going out on a positive note this weekend,” Clarke said. “This is the first time that I swam better at NCAAs than I did at Ivies. I was nervous about not having this last meet go the way I wanted it to, but everything worked out.”
Indeed, Clarke was able to build on a very strong league campaign, in which she was one of eight Harvard women’s swimmers to receive All-Ivy distinction. Clarke was further the sole Crimson representative on the All-Ivy First Team following her victory in the 1,000-yard freestyle at home during Ivies.
The All-American’s talents also extend beyond longer-distance freestyle events. Clarke came in 44th in the 200-yard freestyle and 48th in the 500-yard freestyle at NCAAs, with times of 1:48.03 and 4:47.87, respectively.
The senior’s dominance in the pool has become more than apparent over the past four seasons, but just as much praise can be allotted to her strong character and unwavering leadership.
“Ali has been captain for two years now,” Mills said. “We elect our captains, so that says a lot. We value her guidance so much. We wouldn’t have chosen her if we didn’t have complete trust in her abilities. She’s honestly not lacking in any sense of the word [leadership].”
Mills also competed at the NCAA championships this weekend. The junior put forth an impressive display, placing 27th in the 200-yard butterfly and 64th in the 200 free.
“I would’ve liked to be All-American, but the great part is that I still have another year,” Mills said. “I think I swam an outstanding heat, and I’m really ecstatic.”
Clarke and Mills’ performances at the NCAA championships capped off a successful season for Harvard, which went 6-1 in Ivy League competition. The Crimson also posted solid second-place finishes at the Ivy League and ECAC Championships in February, leaving Mills optimistic about the squad’s future potential.
“Every year’s a new year,” Mills noted. “We’re a really close team, which is odd seeing as we have about 40 players. Next year, we’re hoping to come out strong again. I would love to really see another high-performing relay or two and send more swimmers to NCAAs. Our girls tend to be outstanding students, and there’s nothing to stop them from being just as outstanding athletes.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Alabama was less welcoming than Lynyrd Skynyrd advertised for the men’s tennis team, which came away from the Blue-Gray Classic in Montgomery with a 1-2 record.
Harvard (8-6) fell to eventual tournament winner No. 16 Texas Tech (16-1) in the first round, steamrolled Penn State (12-3) in the second, and yielded in the final round to Boise State (7-6).
While the record was unappealing, the team felt it faced difficult competition and was pleased with its play.
“I’m really happy. I feel everybody fought hard,” junior Alexei Chijoff-Evans said. “The energy was great, and we gave a good performance.”
BOISE STATE 4, HARVARD 3
In Harvard’s final match of the tournament, the Crimson fell in a close battle to No. 71 Boise State.
Harvard started off on the right foot, taking the doubles point by winning two of the three doubles matches. Junior Aba Omodele-Lucien and freshman Christo Schultz shut out their opposition at the top spot, and Chijoff-Evans and rookie Joshua Tchan added an 8-3 victory in the No. 3 match. The sophomore-freshman pairing of Alistair Felton and Andy Nguyen dropped the No. 2 match, 8-5.
The Crimson’s success did not last in the singles though, as Harvard was able to capture only two of the six matches. No. 4 Felton squeezed out a 6-4, 7-6 win, while Omodele-Lucien, Nguyen, and Tchan lost in straight sets.
Nguyen, still suffering from an injury sustained in the first match, elected to play rather than force the rest of his lineup to change.
No. 6 Schultz came back from a 5-2 deficit in the second set to force a tiebreaker and win, leaving Chijoff-Evans at the No. 1 spot with the deciding match against a talented opponent in James Meredith
“[The Boise State] No. 1 was as fine a player in the tournament as there was,” said Crimson coach Dave Fish ’72. “Just a beautiful athlete. Alexei played a great match.”
Chijoff-Evans fell in the third set, leaving his final score 6-2, 6-7, 6-1.
“[Meredith] was an absolutely incredible defensive player,” Chijoff-Evans said. “I’ve never played anybody like that.”
HARVARD 4, PENN STATE 0
In the first match of the consolation bracket, Harvard posted an impressive shutout of No. 44 Penn State to hand the Nittany Lions their third loss of the season.
The doubles point went the Crimson’s way first, as Omodele-Lucien and Schultz teamed up to win the top match, 8-6, and Chijoff-Evans and Tchan united to take the No. 3 match, 8-4. The No. 2 match went to Penn State, 8-5.
Nguyen, who suffered an injury in doubles play, pulled out of the singles matches, leaving Felton to take his spot at No. 3 and the rest of the lineup to advance one place up the ladder.
But Chijoff-Evans and Omodele-Lucien achieved speedy victories at the top of the ladder, and Schultz stepped up to secure the win for Harvard.
At the No. 1 spot, Chijoff-Evans cruised to a 6-0, 6-4 victory, and Omodele-Lucien followed with a 6-4, 6-4 triumph of his own at No. 2. Schultz finished with a 6-0, 7-5 score at the No. 5 spot to end the match.
“The match was a terrific win for us,” Fish said. “Christo Schultz had a terrific day.”
NO. 16 TEXAS TECH 4, HARVARD 0
In its first match of the Classic, Harvard’s chances for the championship were decisively squashed by No. 16 Texas Tech. The Red Raiders, who have lost only once this season and were the eventual tournament champions, did not drop a single match to Harvard.
“They’re a really good team,” Chijoff-Evans said. “All the players are really experienced. They make you play every single point to the full extent.”
To further complicate matters, the Crimson was playing without Schultz at No. 6.
“Christo decides to do a little acrobatic dance [in practice] and falls on his hand,” Fish explained. “We had to reshuffle our lineup.”
Harvard was outmatched from the start, as Texas Tech’s lineup of five Brazilian players and one Ecuadorean tore the Crimson apart. The Red Raiders took all three doubles by a score of 8-3, while in singles, Chijoff-Evans, Omodele-Lucien, and Nguyen lost in the top three spots to give Texas Tech the win.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the March Madness upsets continued over the weekend, so too did an upset happen in the pool. For the first time in the past three years, Harvard’s women’s water polo team defeated a ranked opponent, beating No. 19 California State East Bay (16-7), 15-11, Friday afternoon.
The next day began with a loss to No. 17 Pacific (17-5), but just as the Crimson started the week with a win, it ended with a victory against Cal State Monterey Bay (8-18). The 13-10 win capped a split 3-3 week, giving Harvard an 11-8 record for the year.
“We’re sad to be going home,” sophomore Devan Kennifer said. “We’ve been loving [it in] California.”
The Crimson plans to take lessons from the wins and failures of the past weekend into next week’s match against Marist. Earlier in the season, Harvard fell to the Red Foxes in a close 12-10 battle.
“We are definitely pumped for it,” sophomore Monica Zdrojewski said. “We played Marist earlier this season, and things didn’t go as well as we hoped, so it’s a great opportunity to build from the successes of the week and learn from our losses and victories.”
“We are going to be tanner than them so that’s great,” Zdrojewski added.
HARVARD 13, CAL STATE      MONTEREY BAY 10
In the final game of the squad’s West Coast trip, Harvard jumped out to a 5-1 lead early on before Cal State Monterey Bay came back to make it 7-6 by the half. With the score 10-9 in the fourth quarter, the Crimson shot three into the net while holding the Otters to only one goal, securing its third victory of the week.
“They gave us a good game,” Kennifer said. “We played pretty well, and it was a good game to finish on.”
Zdrojewski’s hat trick in the team’s finale was her third of the week, while sophomore Ita Barton-Kettleborough also scored three. Kennifer managed one tally as well, despite the fact that many of the players at Cal State Monterey Bay have already played with and against her.
“They’re from my hometown and taught by the coach who taught me how to play water polo, so it was great to play that team,” Kennifer said.
NO. 17 PACIFIC 11, HARVARD 5
Even with 33 shots on goal, Harvard had a hard time finding the back of the net in Saturday’s opener. The Crimson was scoreless in the first half of the match and down, 5-0, at the break, thanks to solid defense and Pacific goalie Brooke Millar’s quick reactions.
“Their goalie was really good,” Kennifer said. “We put up a lot of shots against them but just couldn’t find the back of the net.”
Down 8-3 going into the fourth quarter, Kennifer completed her third hat trick of the week to pull the Crimson closer. While Harvard grabbed two more goals, the Tigers scored again in the final 16 seconds.
“We thought that on a different day, we probably could have won and beat that team,” said sophomore goalie Laurel McCarthy, who recorded seven saves. “We were having bad luck with our shooting, but I think it’ll be exciting to play them again. I don’t think the score reflected how close the game was, which was a little disappointing.”
HARVARD 15, NO. 19 CAL               STATE EAST BAY 9
Just as Tiger Woods will always remember the first hole-in-one he shot, most of the members of Harvard’s squad will always remember the first time they beat a ranked opponent.
“The East Bay game was definitely my favorite,” McCarthy said. “That was the first time since I’ve been on Harvard water polo that we beat a ranked opponent. It’s been a while.”
The Crimson jumped out to an early 3-1 lead before the Pioneers brought it to within one after the first eight minutes of play. Ahead 8-6 at the half and 10-9 at the end of the third quarter, the Harvard athletes could feel that they would need an extra kick in the last quarter.
Kennifer and Zdrojewski each completed a hat trick in the final quarter as the Crimson grabbed five tallies to East Bay’s two, sealing the victory.
Junior Patricia Smith, who started each game this week after freshman Elise Molnar suffered a concussion, tabbed her own hat trick as well, as Harvard ended the Pioneers’ five-game win streak.
“Patty Smith deserves a lot of credit,” McCarthy said. “We’ve had a lot of trouble starting out our first quarters, and she got in there, and two games in a row she scored the first two goals. She took control of the offense, and it was awesome.”
Freshman Aisha Price and sophomore Shannon Purcell each banked two in the net to help the Crimson, while McCarthy stopped four of East Bay’s shots.
“First with them being a ranked opponent, we were viewed as an underdog going into the game,” Zdrojewski said. “For us to be able to step up to that and be able to have control during the duration of the game was a great thing.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If there is one thing the Harvard men’s volleyball team knows how to do, it is showing up for big games.
Despite starting the season 0-10 against non-conference opponents, Saturday’s 3-0 victory over Sacred Heart (13-8, 3-1 EIVA Hay Division) put the Crimson at 2-1 in conference play and earned it the third spot in the division standings.
“In a weird way, timing is everything,” co-captain Gil Weintraub said. “We’re peaking at the right time. It’s great because we’re putting ourselves in a position to succeed in league, which is the ultimate goal.”
But the second win of the season for Harvard (2-11, 2-1 EIVA Hay Division) did not come with much breathing room.
Playing on the road in Fairfield, Conn., the Crimson outscored Sacred Heart by just two and three points to capture the first and third sets, respectively. But behind strong serving, efficient offense, and well-placed blocking, Harvard captured the 3-0 victory, 30-28, 30-23, 30-27.
Sophomores Nikola Ivica and Matt Jones led the strong Harvard attack, which finished at a 37 percent attack clip, marking just the second time this season the Crimson attacked at an efficiency above 35 percent.
Ivica finished with a game-high 20 kills, while Jones added 18. Ivica benefited from the Pioneers’ aggressive style of defense, as he utilized the opposite side of the court when the Sacred Heart defenders set up their block on the outside.
With the strategy’s initial success, Weintraub, the team’s setter, continued to find his open target.
“When a player is that hot, just keep feeding him,” Weintraub said.
Ivica’s final total of 20 kills marked a season-high for the native of Serbia.
But Ivica was not the only Harvard player to come up with a big game.	Weintraub handed out a season-high 49 assists to go along with just one setting error. Weintraub, who started the season at attack, shifted back to the setter position midway through the season to aid his injury-riddled team. Since Weintraub’s return to his natural position, the Crimson has gone 2-3.
“Gil set phenomenally,” co-captain Erik Kuld said. “He’s making the hitters’ job really easy.”
But Harvard’s success on Saturday resulted from more than just its high-powered offense. Defensively, the Crimson was able to slow down the Pioneers, holding its opponent to an attack rate below 30 percent.
Crucial to the visiting team’s defensive success was the ability of its blockers to get touches on the ball. Harvard finished with nine team blocks, led by Ivica, who batted away two spike attempts.
“We weren’t just killing the ball, we were messing up their offense as well,” Weintraub said. “We were taking points away from them.”
The Crimson’s defense was particularly effective in the match’s opening two sets, during which Harvard held the Pioneers to 14 kills in each frame.
The Crimson grabbed the first set in dramatic fashion, rebounding from a 17-12 deficit to take a narrow two-point victory. Service errors plagued Sacred Heart down the stretch and strong play from Jones gave the Crimson the lead.
Jones led his team from behind the service line, finishing with four of Harvard’s nine aces. The Crimson also committed its fewest service errors of the season with nine.
Serving helped Harvard take control in the second, as the team went on a 15-5 run midway through the set to take a commanding lead. The Crimson did not look back from there, cruising to the seven-point win.
The third set was not as easy for Harvard, as Sacred Heart took an early 4-0 lead. But Jones came up with big plays for the Crimson, notching two aces and two kills in the early going to help Harvard take a 10-7 advantage. With the momentum back on its side, the Crimson did not let go of its lead, eventually closing out the match with the 30-27 win.
“I thought we played really well,” Weintraub said. “It was the first glimpse of what we’ve been working toward and working for.”

Black miniskirt, white v-neck, and purple cardigan? Or blue miniskirt, black tank top, and silver bangles? It’s Friday night and you’re heading out for a night of fun with the girls. It’s almost time to meet them—but your outfit is far from perfect.
This is when Go Try It On, a Web site founded by Harvard Business School graduate Marissa A. Evans, comes in handy. With three simple steps, you can upload a photo, add a brief description, and post your image for comments, compliments, and scrutiny from the public eye.
While this site may not be necessary for many college students who are constantly surrounded by blockmates and friends willing to lend some advice or loan out clothing, it can be handy for the man or woman living alone who needs that extra opinion.
This Web site sounds like the ultimate solution to an outfit’s dilemma, but questions still linger: What if the comments get out of hand? What if the feedback blurs the line between constructive and critical?
We decided to test it out with one of our own. We posted a photo of an outfit worn to this correspondent’s high school prom: a purple strapless dress, black heels, a black bag, and a gold necklace. Then, we asked Go Try It On visitors to tell us what they thought.
One viewer said the following: “The dress is great, but the high necklace totally ruins the great neckline that this dress gives you, you should definitely not wear a necklace with this dress.”
Another viewer agreed, but in a slightly different manner. “Love the dress! You look great. Not loving the bag/ necklace combo. Maybe try something jeweled for the bag, and some sparkly earrings instead of the necklace. Show off that collarbone! Well done!”
Overall, the consensus was to lose the bag and the necklace and keep the dress. We appreciate the advice, but we caution other users to take it with a grain of salt. Regardless of what you end up wearing, own it and flaunt it, and the night will be yours.
