After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A water main break sent a steady stream down Mt. Auburn St. early Friday morning near the intersection with JFK Street.
The deluge rendered the road practically impassible by car, and pedestrians stopped to marvel at the growing puddle. The authorities were on the scene shortly after 1:30 a.m. and were still working to control the break at press time.

No matter how many clubs you sign up for at the activities fair, you're guaranteed to have missed some you would’ve sold your soul to know about and join at least a handful of clubs you will never attend a meeting for. That being said, here are some pearls of wisdom:
DON’T (we repeat, do not) give a club your email address if you have zero intentions of joining but just want to feel as if you’re doing something productive by signing up. Soon enough, half of your emails will be from clubs you got peer-pressured into signing up for knowing fully well you didn’t want to. You might feel bad about saying no to the sign-up list, but not to worry! If all your tactics fail, just put down that annoying kid in your entryway’s email instead.
DO spend a lot of time exploring. It might be good to go through the whole fair more than once, especially if you have an idea of a club you want to join. There are more or less a zillion clubs here, and you’re bound to find pretty much anything you might want to do. Keep looking if you can’t find it! We promise, the club of ~your dreams~ is out there.
