After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Completely reversing the audience’s opinion of a particular character is a sizable storytelling challenge. Those narratives that do so most successfully—“Harry Potter” and “A Song of Ice and Fire” immediately come to mind—tend to be sweeping, plot-driven tales that supply multiple perspectives on characters by dint of their scope. It is quite impressive, then, that an episodic comedy like “Broad City” has in its most recent episode made it almost impossible to hate Trey.
The show writers (one of whom, Paul W. Downs, portrays Trey) have executed this transformation at no cost to the show’s humor. Trey of Season 1 is the NYC fitness douchebag elevated to its comic pinnacle: “Do a 5k, take an ice bath, urinate as hard and fast as you can,” he advises Abbi when she fakes a cold. Trey of Season 3 responds to Abbi’s reluctant summons after she has been robbed and runs through the apartment with a baseball bat, shouting “Clear!” after he checks each room; the selection of DVDs he brings over consists of “The Hangover 3” (“Honestly the best one”), “Babe” (“Oscar nom”), and “Ratatouille” (“My personal favorite”). And so it’s cause for celebration when Abbi finally decides to make her move and sleeps with him.
The theme of the episode might well be described as “surprisingly likable men.” While Abbi and Trey watch Pixar, Ilana hooks up with NBA player Blake Griffin (playing himself), who, by virtue of his over-6’5” stature, constitutes for Ilana a “stamp in my sexual passport.” When Ilana discovers that Griffin’s genitalia are of similar stature, the pair are forced to get creative in what is likely the most wonderfully ridiculous sex scene ever shown on TV. Griffin further earns his keep when he and Ilana discuss the WNBA: “It’s just like the best version of basketball there is,” he says. Later, Abbi is concerned that Lincoln might be jealous, but the episode’s final scene—the best of the season so far—proves otherwise. With one of Griffin’s shoes strung over his shoulder by its laces, Lincoln excitedly explains to a hotdog vendor that he’s using Griffin’s shoe as a “murse” because they are now Eskimo brothers.
The episode’s smaller details are similarly brilliant: Abbi and Ilana’s spontaneous transformation of street clothes into club chic and Ilana’s uncomprehending Japanese subletters, who try to use their phone to translate what she is saying, land particularly well. By the end of the episode, however, Trey is what stands out by far. With three episodes left in the season, Downs will hopefully have plenty more opportunity to shine.

Describing the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert & Sullivan Players’ staging of “H.M.S. Pinafore, Or The Lass That Loved a Sailor” as a shipshape production not only feels natural (nautical?) but also reflects the production’s seemingly effortless success. The show, which ran March 25-April 3 in the Agassiz Theater, featured spot-on direction executed by a superb cast, impressively tight orchestration, thoughtful and professionally performed choreography, and a beautiful set and costumes to boot.  From the moment music director Jacob Moscona ’16 lifted his baton to key in the plucky violins and reverberating percussion that punctuates the operetta’s buoyant overture, the Agassiz stage transformed into the deck of an interwar British battleship (albeit one that never leaves port) on which the actors sang, danced, and dazzled. Smooth sailing, indeed.
In traditional G&S fashion, “H.M.S. Pinafore” combines not-so-subtle sociopolitical satire with upbeat music and colorful characters. Doe-eyed sailor Ralph Rackstraw (Alex J. Raun ’17) courts Captain Corcoran’s daughter, Josephine (Olivia R. Miller ’16), whom he laments as “a lass above his station.” Miller’s voice, for example, soared during a breathtaking rendition of “Sorry her lot who loves too well,” capturing Josephine’s same realization that the British focus on wealth and status confines her love for Rackstraw. To that end, Moscona, director Olivia M. Munk ’16, and HRG&SP historian Barra A. Peak ’18 in their playbill notes emphasized the strict order and limited social mobility of late nineteenth-century England, where someone like Captain Corcoran (Ben M. Kelly ’17) would dream of setting up Josephine with the high-ranking Sir Joseph (Kevin Q. Hilgartner ’16) and shudder to think of her illicit liaisons with a common tar.
Munk successfully coached the actors to tease out these social burdens with both wit and flair on stage. Kelly mastered the twinkling eyes, smooth swagger, and everyman smile of Captain Corcoran, embodying the cartoonish persona of an eight-year-old child who has always dreamed of running a ship. Hilgartner, for his part, pulled off the curmudgeonly, bug-eyed Sir Joseph with an understated ease that commanded chuckles. (“I thought so little, they rewarded me, / And now I am the ruler of the Queen’s navy,” he sang, simultaneously proud of his social promotion yet still blissfully befuddled as to how he achieved it.) And Brad A. Latilla-Campbell ’16, as the unpleasant sailor Dick Deadeye, combined sardonic humor à la Russell Brand and utter silliness with such conviction that his hamming it up on stage practically took the production from operetta to improv comedy club. The cookie-cutter British tars and Sir Joseph’s gaggle of sisters, cousins, and aunts—torn straight from the pages of a vintage 1920s resort catalog—rounded out the cast and added to the show’s effortless musicality, most notably in the number “A Many Years Ago.”
Professional-quality choreography and subtle lighting choices attentively enhanced the production’s already-beautifully rendered musical numbers. Swabbing the deck-slash-stage, Rackstraw and the British tars twirled mops with mesmerizing synchronization throughout Act I, and Captain Corcoran, Josephine, and Sir Joseph maintained the show’s energy by jigging it up in the happy “Never Mind the Why and Wherefore” in Act II. When the cast rang in the show’s denouement by singing,“Oh joy, oh rapture unforeseen,” they clearly had known the ropes all along.

“Don’t make this about race.” 
I’ve heard this sentence a lot recently, read it a lot online. Saw its use launch a Facebook flame war while I waited for my plane to board at the end of spring break. It’s the easiest way for white people to invalidate experiences of oppression and avoid fraught debates about justice in America.
But of course it’s about race—everything is. Our country was built on oppression, and race is everywhere, at every moment on my standard trip back to Harvard.
The view from my airplane window is about race. Colonizers killed Indigenous people for those tidy plots of farmland. We profited from those fields by exploiting and terrorizing slaves. We rejected demands for land return and reparations, compounding racist domination based on the pretext of “free market” capitalism, and we devised new ways to produce and preserve systemic injustice. It is impossible to separate the wealth that paid for my plane ticket from structural oppression. When I land at Logan, it’s about race.
Sometimes, my uncle picks me up at the airport, and we drive into Cambridge on the Central Artery. The Central Artery is also about race. Its construction tore Chinatown apart in the 1950s and ‘60s. Land that was home to generations of low-income Chinese immigrants—who lived there because they were unwelcome in more desirable parts of Boston—was seized through eminent domain. Blocks of affordable homes were demolished, and more than a thousand residents were forced from the neighborhood. The Central Artery also severed present-day Chinatown from those who lived east of Interstate 93, dividing a whole community. Then, when the Massachusetts Turnpike followed in the 1960s and ‘70s, it further isolated the neighborhood from immigrants living to the south.
In combination with luxury high-rise developments, these infrastructure projects slashed away at affordable housing. This is not race-neutral. City officials knew these incursions would do irreparable damage, but the marginalized people of Chinatown had little political power. Today, low-income Chinese immigrants can no longer afford to pay rent in Chinatown. They represent less than half of present-day residents. A neighborhood that was built many years ago by people like them, for people like them, isn’t theirs anymore. That’s about race.
If my uncle can’t get off work, I take the Silver Line to South Station, then the Red Line to Harvard Square. The Silver Line’s about race, too. In the 1960’s, protests broke out in Jamaica Plain, Roxbury, and the South End when Boston started razing homes for another highway project. The people of color who inhabited these neighborhoods, primarily Black and Latino, knew their livelihoods and communities would never have come under such existential threat if they were rich and white. They forced the city to halt construction, but the deal stripped majority-Black Roxbury of its Orange Line access to the MBTA. The city promised to replace it, but residents are still relegated to the inefficient and unreliable buses of the Silver Line. Whether it’s retribution or negligence, that’s about race.
Right off the T station in Harvard Square, the benches on Mass. Ave are partitioned. Handrails also divide the benches at Trinity Church and Jamaica Pond, and solar panels segment flashy new seats in Central Square. This is hostile architecture. These narrowly spaced partitions—like concrete spikes on highway medians and iron studs on sidewalks—exist to keep people from lying down when they have no place else to sleep. Hostile architecture is designed to repel the homeless and others who “loiter” in public spaces. The majority of America’s homeless are people of color, the denial of economic opportunity is a function of structural oppression, and the fear that justifies hostile architecture is predicated on highly racialized stereotypes. These benches are also about race.
America’s wealth and power is derived from the violence of genocide and human bondage. We reify white supremacy through exclusion, eviction, and eminent domain, and we reinforce white supremacy by denying it. We say, “Not everything is a race issue. Don’t make this about race.” But Harvard exists on this land because of race, I pay for plane tickets because of race, and I get here on the Silver Line or by the Central Artery because of race.
Because in a country built on oppression, everything is about race. Including the benches.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Publicly walking in my Army uniform makes me very uncomfortable. The awkward stares as I quietly enjoy lunch, the occasional drunkard who warns me of some government super-soldier program, and the self-righteous student hoping to lecture me on the morality of war mean that wearing my uniform around Cambridge tends to make for an interesting day. The phrase “thank you for your service,” however, presents the largest source of discomfort by far.
When someone confronts me with the phrase “thank you for your service,” my mind freezes. Do I respond to this with another “thank you”? Should I silently nod, or would that come off as rude? Or should I tell them the truth: that I’m a cadet, not a soldier. I’ve never been deployed. I’ve never spent more than a month at a fort, nor do I drill with the National Guard or Army Reserve. Hell, I don’t even know the Cadet Creed.
When thanked for my service, I feel guilty. Guilty of stealing attention away from those who’ve already served yet remain forgotten. At first glance, such a claim might seem foolish. We’ve got Veteran’s Day, Memorial Day, and tons of monuments dedicated to service personnel, past and present. Military discounts are abundant: even Ben & Jerry’s offers one (up to 15 percent off, if you’re interested). But despite these benefits, military personnel often find themselves unfairly blamed by the public as responsible for the unpopular conflicts they’re sent to fight in.
As the armed forces continue to face force reductions, the community of veterans continuously becomes smaller. Technological advances and the shift towards an all-volunteer force enabled the U.S. to maintain global military supremacy with fewer troops. As a result, a smaller proportion of Americans have served now than ever before. Those who now serve disproportionately come from military families, making the cost of war a distant thought from the daily considerations of most of the population at large.
Nevertheless, despite their dwindling numbers, military personnel have found themselves in a constant state of war since Congress passed the Authorization for Use of Military Force against Terrorists in September 2001. With the ever-expanding War on Terror and growing military commitments to allies across the globe, our military finds itself stretched thin. Yet despite America’s increased military role in maintaining the current international system, years of war have drained the public’s support for interventions abroad.
In terms of public opinion, military personnel find themselves at the center of America’s contentious foreign policy. On one hand, our service personnel enjoy unparalleled respect. According to a 2011 Gallup poll, 78 percent of Americans express a “great deal” or “quite a lot” of confidence in America’s armed forces; only 3 percent expressed “very little” or “none” at all. To this day, no other government group receives as much widespread respect as those in uniform.
Yet when it comes to the wars our troops are sent to fight, most Americans find them morally dubious at best. By mid-2014, 71 percent of Americans declared that the invasion of Iraq wasn’t worth the cost. As of June 2015, 42 percent of Americans viewed the Afghan war as a mistake. Following a decade of nonstop conflicts, the American public has grown tired of watching the young spill their blood in what most believe are hopeless quagmires.
So what about the individuals sent to kill and die in these so-called hopeless quagmires? How strange to be held in such high esteem, yet be sent to fight wars condemned by the same individuals who laud your service when they greet you on the street? If your comrades-in-arms lay down their lives for unpopular causes, was their blood spilled in vain, or does the public’s adoration of your uniform somehow make the sacrifice worth something?
I understand that individuals mean well when they thank others for their service. After all, a little gratitude goes a long way. Nevertheless, there’s something off-putting about our willingness to worship a uniform whilst ignoring those who wear it. We’ve been at war for almost 15 years, yet we continuously separate the military from the civilian world that sends its soldiers to fight and die almost as an afterthought.
As a public, we’ve grown accustomed to the image of the stoic soldier. In worshiping this idol, we’ve forgotten the human cost behind the wars we wage. Soldiers are more than uniforms; they’re people, citizens whose lives continue long after they’ve retired from military service. I’m not arguing against respecting the uniform, nor am I advocating for individuals to abstain from critiquing military policy. Rather, I simply want society to separate the wars soldiers fight from the soldiers themselves.
Sometime this Wednesday I’ll be headed to MIT in uniform. Some will see a representation of freedom. Others will see an embodiment of cruel American power. A few might thank me for what I haven’t yet done. I wonder if anyone will look past all that and see the name on my uniform: Williams.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It has lately become fashionable to see the freedom of expression as under attack, and not entirely without reason. The rise of “safe spaces” and “trigger warnings” has prompted furious brow-furrowing by those who see the First Amendment as threatened. We need not wade into the national debate about these issues to see that Harvard is not immune from concern.
Last Monday brought the latest episode in this saga, as members of the Law School student activist group Reclaim Harvard Law took down posters equating their movement to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. The Reclaim movement—which is in the name of racial equality on campus—has been occupying the lounge in the Caspersen Student Center, calling it “Belinda Hall” after a slave owned by Law School benefactor Isaac Royall Jr., and cited the posters’ potential offensiveness to Muslim law students that were to meet there.
Throughout the week, both sides subsequently put up posters in the lounge in contravention of the Law School’s no-postering policy, prompting Law School Dean Martha Minow to modify that policy on Friday. That night, however, an as-yet-unknown individual vandalized the Reclaim group’s signs with the words “stop censorship.” Since then, the activists and counter-activists have traded accusations of censorship: the former for removing the posters and the latter for the anonymous vandalism.
It is important to note that, methods aside, the Reclaim movement has legitimate grievances. Though we have opposed some of their demands and tactics before, it is undeniable that many minority law students feel alienated from their peers and from their school. This is an unacceptable state of affairs. We are proud to attend a college and a university that strives to build an ever more inclusive campus. Harvard should be a place for students to find a home, regardless of their background or past.
When law students say that their voices are not being heard, that deeply disturbs us. We have said before that these problems are structural, and indeed they involve the composition of the faculty, the history of the school, and the culture. We are heartened that they are now being brought to the fore.
Past oppression, however, should never serve as a rationale for its continuation in any form. The right to free expression, as messy and complicated as it might be, must never be abridged. At a basic level, a movement like Reclaim is possible because they hold the unalienable rights to speak and assemble.
We deplore the systemic factors that cause minority law students to feel incapable of speaking out on equal terms with their classmates, but we do so precisely because such impediments harm the free exchange of ideas. The benefits of diversity are lost when certain groups, though physically present, cannot be thoroughly vocal and engaged. By failing to hear each other fully, we cannot learn from each other fully, and by not learning from each other fully, we cannot partake in full of the personal, academic, and social growth that Harvard stands for.
The de jure protections of free speech are not a substitute to, but rather a prerequisite for, a university where students can speak on equal footing. They are not a salve that subordinates the concerns of students to blind faith in institutions, but instead the only guarantor of a more inclusive future towards which to work.
History tells us that heavy-handed censorship rarely works to the benefit of the oppressed. Failing to uphold the societal, administrative, and legal rules that, however imperfectly used, purport to give each person an equal microphone means that we no longer have a foundation on which to seek equality. If we lack a philosophical dedication to free speech, why strive for it at all? The graffiti and the removal of posters might seem insignificant, but in fact, they signal an undermining of that commitment.
Our present failures to achieve our high-minded ideals of genuine diversity and inclusivity are never reasons to reject our goals. Indeed, they are reasons to rededicate ourselves to them, and so too it must be with the freedom of expression.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a fruitful debate during the Undergraduate Council’s Sunday meeting over the funding of Tuesday’s “Berry Brain Break,” a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health has agreed to have his department sponsor the event.
Following a contentious vote by the UC to spend $850 on berries as part of this week’s Freshman Health Project, School of Public Health nutrition professor Eric B. Rimm voiced his support for having berries at the brain break, and offered to have his department cover the costs of the berries.
Rimm, who has been a blueberry researcher for about 15 years, said he wanted to sponsor the event because he felt that “students were being cheated out of berries.”
He said part of the motivation for funding the berries was that he worried undergraduates were not eating healthy foods.
“I am concerned about freshmen when they come in, because not all of them have had healthy food as part of their childhood learning,” Rimm said. “I think Harvard Dining can help them by giving them options that are healthier and also taste good.”
Department of Nutrition Chair Walter C. Willett wrote in an email that he supported the Freshman Class Committee's efforts “for putting healthy eating on the table.”
“Too often this would be pizza,” Willett added.
The Freshman Class Committee, which had originally allocated close to 10 percent of its annual budget on the berries, expressed gratitude for the offer.
“It’s an incredibly generous offer that they’ve extended,” Freshman Class Committee Treasurer Scott Xiao ’19 said. “It goes... with our motivation for Freshman Health Project: to promote issues related to student health.”
Several of the UC’s freshman representatives, who are organizing this week’s Freshman Health Project, said they pushed for bringing berries to brain break in response to demand seen in a survey of the freshman class.
“Bananas aren’t enough,” Freshman Class Committee Secretary Leah D. Stewart ’19 wrote in an email to freshmen publicizing the event. “We heard you, we fought for you, you will be getting your berries.”
Xiao said the committee would consider providing berries for students again at brain break, but that funding berries could prove to be a financial difficulty. According to Harvard University Dining Services Spokesperson Crista Martin, berries tend to be too expensive to be feasible daily options.
“Berries are incredibly expensive, and rarely in season locally when Harvard students are on campus,” Martin wrote in an email.
“As a daily item, they are too expensive for the quality we’d be able to get,” Martin added.
Xiao said that despite controversy over the initial vote, many students had expressed enthusiasm and support for the UC’s decision to bring berries to brain break.
In the past, representatives have said they want to pursue smaller initiatives like study breaks in addition to their broader goals.
“Life at Harvard is pretty good as it is,” Elm Yard Representative Evan M. Bonsall ’19 said in an interview last month. “But there are still some low hanging fruit where we could make some really simple changes to make life a lot better.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Housing rights advocates interrupted an event featuring Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Melvin Watt at the Law School Monday evening to protest Watt’s housing finance policies, prematurely ending the event and prompting questions about security protocol at the school.
The event, organized by Law School professor Hal S. Scott, was intended to be a “fire-side chat” about federal housing policy. Scott said he heard beforehand that activists might protest, and as a result, Harvard University Police Department assigned two plainclothes officers to the event at the request of Law School administrators.
Several minutes into the event, members of City Life—a Boston-area community organization that advocates for tenant rights—stood up and interrupted Watt’s remarks. City Life community organizer M. Antonio Ennis coordinated the protest with advocacy organizations Lynn United for Change and Springfield No One Leaves, and estimated that around 75 of the 85 event attendees were protesters.
The activists—who are not affiliated with the Law School—presented Watt with several demands primarily focused on principal reduction, a policy that reduces mortgage principals for qualifying homeowners. Ennis said City Life members had helped put Watt in office two years ago after Watt promised to make principal reduction a centerpiece of his agenda. Watt has not yet created such a policy.
“If he couldn’t do it, why can’t he tell us—the people who are losing our houses?” City Life volunteer Ramon Sepulveda said.
Representatives from Watt’s office at the Federal Housing Finance Authority declined to comment.
Ennis said that City Life had attempted to reach the Federal Housing Finance Agency director several times unsuccessfully. When he heard from a Law School student who does clinical work for City Life that Watt would be speaking at the school, Ennis saw an opportunity.
“Our objective in coming here was to show him the faces of people who have lost their homes,” Ennis said. “We’re embarrassed to be losing our homes, so we wanted to embarrass him here on his platform at Harvard.”
After protesters interrupted Watt in a manner Scott characterized as “screaming,” Watt attempted to answer their questions, but was unable to talk over activists. Scott said the HUPD officers did not ask protesters to leave, and seeing no way to continue the discussion, Scott escorted Watt from the event.
“An HLS administrator asked the protesters to stop disrupting the event.  The event ended shortly thereafter,” HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano wrote in an email. “As a matter of policy we are not going to get into specifics on what our officers did.”
Scott expressed disappointment that Watt was unable to finish the discussion, and raised concerns over security protocol in place at Harvard. Scott said he thinks security should have removed the protesters.
“I would hope Harvard’s policies are that we don’t allow people to come and disrupt events,” he said. “Where do we draw the line? Can these people come into classrooms, and we do nothing?... I was appalled, quite frankly, that security didn’t do more.”
According to the Law School’s official Protest and Dissent Guidelines, “The speaker is entitled to communicate her or his message to the audience during her or his allotted time, and the audience is entitled to hear the message and see the speaker during that time. A dissenter must not substantially interfere with a speaker’s ability to communicate or an audience’s ability to see and hear the speaker.”
After protesters cut the event short, Scott brought Watt to his office to continue the discussion on camera. He said he will make the video available to Law School students online.

Public outcry has sprouted over Harvard’s recent removal of four large trees from the Smith Campus Center plaza as part of a larger multi-year renovation project.
The four large Bradford pear trees provided shade in Forbes Plaza, located directly across Mass. Ave. from Harvard Yard. Although officially owned by the University, the plaza is publicly accessible and frequented by residents, homeless people, and tourists hoping to enjoy the outdoor recreational space.
“[The plaza] attracts people from all corners,” Cambridge City Councillor Jan Devereux said. “It’s a well-loved space.”
Several local residents said they were saddened by Harvard’s decision to cut the trees down for the renovations of the Smith Center.
"It’s a disaster,” Cambridge resident Eleanor M. McPeck said. “It’s a very lively, attractive place with the trees and now its lost its charm and character.”
Gregory H. Daugherty, a local fixture who sells Spare Change newspapers around the plaza, said locals already miss the trees.
“When you come through this area here, when you see the trees and the birds flying around in the springtime and summertime, it was a feeling that you wanted to enjoy,” Daugherty said. “People can’t believe the trees are gone.”
Locals also said they felt shocked by the trees’ seemingly sudden removal, arguing that Harvard did not do enough to inform the public of its plans ahead of time.
“Many people felt blindsided that the trees were removed,” Devereux said. “They didn’t realize these trees were coming down, particularly in a space that so many members of the community feel very attached to.”
Harvard had previously revised its building plans in response to public criticism, providing for additional space in the plaza. More generally, Harvard has held 19 public meetings with “Harvard Square stakeholders" over the course of more than a year according to University Spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke.
"The number of trees, green space and amenities like public bathrooms, chess tables and food vendors will all be increased, benefiting both the Cambridge and Harvard communities," O'Rourke wrote.
Despite the plans for new trees, Devereux said she was worried many aging residents will not be able to see “the new trees reach the same canopy and breadth” as the older trees.
Harvard Environmental Action Committee Co-Chair Sabrina G. Devereaux ’18 said she hoped Harvard would make up for the trees’ removal.
“It is always sad when people cut down trees, especially with greenhouse gases and [carbon dioxide] in the atmosphere being such a large problem,” Devereaux said. “Those trees were probably decades old. I just hope Harvard does more to compensate for that loss.”
Others, however, are optimistic about the changes the renovations will bring to the plaza.
“I always hate to see a tree cut,” Donald H. Pfister, professor of botany and former interim dean of the College, said. “In this case, I think it’s part of a larger plan, so what can I say? They’re gone now. They will be replaced by this atrium, and it will be something wonderful.”

Harvard faculty members praised General Electric’s decision to move its headquarters to Boston as an opportunity for increased collaboration between the corporation and students, especially given local expertise in data and technology.
“For Harvard students, it is a mutually beneficial arrangement between General Electric and the Boston ecosystem,” said Jodi Goldstein, who has worked at GE and is currently the Managing Director of Harvard’s Innovation Lab.
The surrounding universities, she added, create a rich intellectual environment from which the corporation can draw talented students.
Gu-Yeon Wei, a professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Harvard, echoed Goldstein's thinking that GE will benefit from Boston’s large number of universities.
“I think having a large number of these universities in this area would be a big asset to GE because then they have a potential pool of hires they can draw on,” Wei said.
Goldstein also said GE’s move is yet another confirmation that Boston is a well-positioned city in the technology sector.
“We have a strong focus on technology, innovation, and robotics. Life sciences is obviously incredibly strong,” she said.
The company’s move to the region may also mean a potential new source for student engagement at Harvard, according to Goldstein.
“We have so many large corporations interested in engaging with students in the i-lab,” Goldstein said. “I envision working with General Electric in different ways.”
Willy C. Shih, a professor at the Business School, said the corporation’s move also marks a return to its historic roots. In particular, Shih cited the company’s partnership with MIT chemist Willis Whitney, who ran General Electric’s industrial research laboratory in the early 1900s.
Shih also said he believed GE’s move was potentially made to address a new “industrial Internet” era in which there is an increasing emphasis on innovative technology. He added that Boston is already a leader in areas such as robotics.
“They want to open themselves up to fresh ideas," Shih said. "To immerse themselves in the ecosystem here and to learn from that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After five days without Chickpea Fritters or BBQ Seitan, vegetarian eatery Clover Food Lab opened their new Harvard Square location early Tuesday afternoon for the first time since closing their former storefront last week.
The restaurant closed its doors last Thursday and originally planned to open its new location last Friday, according to Clover Founder and CEO Ayr Muir. However, construction and inspection delays pushed the opening to Tuesday.

Clover’s relocation comes after the restaurant was forced to move out of their Smith Campus Center storefront due to renovations slated to last until the spring of 2018. Although Clover faced uncertainty in finding a new location in Harvard Square, the company was able to lease a storefront just a few steps away at 1326 Mass. Ave.—formerly home to Szechuan-style Chinese restaurant Yenching.
“I really didn’t want to be in the other side of the Square. We established ourselves here and now we’re even closer to the Yard.” Muir said.
Although the new space is considerably smaller than the former location, Clover was able to keep its large community table and also install new booths along the sides.
The new location has a modern feel, with a full glass storefront, large windows, and LCD screens displaying the menu. However, one standout feature of the new restaurant predates Clover itself—the walls of the new store are covered with tile pennants of schools including Harvard that were discovered during demolition according to Muir.
“Constructors are not usually very sensitive about it and don’t tell you what they found,” Muir said. “In our case, our contractor started sending pictures to me and I said ‘let’s preserve it.’”
Other schools with their flags along the top edge of the walls include the University of Michigan and the now-defunct Harvard football rival Carlisle Indian Industrial, which was a federally funded boarding school for Native Americans until its closing in 1918.
Muir said the tiles inspired him to do some research at the Cambridge Historical Society in the hopes of finding out what occupied the restaurant during the early 1900s.
To Muir’s surprise, he discovered the restaurant used to be home to two of Cambridge’s main cafeterias. The first was the Waldorf Lunch Place, followed by the Hayes-Bickford.
“100 years later, we are trying to build a chain and the Waldorf Lunch Place was actually one of the first restaurant chains in the world,” Muir said. “It had almost 200 locations from the late 1800s to the early 1900s.”
According to Clover Director of Communications Lucia Jazayeri, the Waldorf Lunch was an important meeting space for both students and laborers in the early 1900s when Cambridge was a more blue collar town. Later on in the same location, Hayes-Bickford was the site of several major meetings during the civil rights movement, Jayerzi said.
Students said they were pleased with the renovation, especially Clover’s decision to restore the tiles.
“I think the old tiling really characterizes this Clover as Harvard's own Clover, as opposed to any other location, while the new counter and kitchen spaces adds a nice, modern flare to it,” said Gaby D.M. Ruiz-Colon ’16. “

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a contentious debate harkening back to last year’s election, the Cambridge City Council sent a resolution to committee that could potentially institute municipal lobbying regulations.
According to sponsoring Councillors Jan Devereux, Nadeem A. Mazen, and Dennis J. Carlone, the resolution aims to make local government transparent and accountable by disclosing conversations and donations associated with lobbyists.
“It would benefit the public to require lobbyists to register and publicly report their work in the City of Cambridge,” the Council’s resolution read.
The resolution cited similar legislation making its way through the Massachusetts State Senate and Boston City Council. It also gave examples of cities across the nation that had implemented lobbying regulations like San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston.
“People are talking about having the same types of disclosures that exist at the federal level,” Mazen said. “Those meetings and those actions you take as a lobbyist are under greater and much more transparent public scrutiny.”
While the resolution passed, some council members expressed concerns that neighborhood groups would fall under the categorization of lobbyist.
“If we’re trying to encourage transparency at all levels of government, whose life does it include?” Councillor Craig A. Kelley said. “It’s not entirely clear. I think we need to specifically figure out what it is we are looking for before we turn around and say ‘this is how we regulate it’.”
However, Devereux said that regulations would not impact local activists but rather individuals who receive substantial payment for their efforts and interactions with the City Council.
“That is not what we’re looking at,” Devereux said. “We’re looking at paid professionals representing clients.”
Such disagreements reminded some councillors of the previous election cycle, in which topics of campaign finance were of great importance.
“Transparency, lobbying, and public disclosure were a part of the last election,” Mazen said. “Some people have a huge preponderance of their money coming from special interests.”
“It costs a surprising amount of money to run a campaign for city council,” Devereux said. “[The resolution] was not to dredge up any divisive feelings left over from the campaign.”
The Council was split according to last election’s slates on where to send the resolution next. Devereux, Carlone, and Mazen originally intended for the resolution to be sent to the City Manager for review, however, the remaining six councillors preferred to send the order to the Government Operations, Rules and Claims Committee for further discussion. Councillors Devereux, Carlone, and Mazen were, unlike the other six councillors, not members of the “Unity Slate” from last fall’s election.
“I think the signal that some of my colleagues are sending in not sending it to the Manager is ‘wouldn’t it be nice if we took our time with this’ rather than everyone circle their wagons because this is important,” Mazen said. “I think people are just putting their priorities out there on full display.”
Discussion on the resolution had been postponed from the council’s meeting on March 21 after Kelley suggested the council do “some more research.”
The Government Operations, Rules and Claims Committee is currently in the process of determining a successor to City Manager Richard C. Rossi, a process which may delay the discussion of this resolution.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: APRIL 6, 2016, at 4:30 p.m.
The clock is ticking for “Harvard time.”
Two pending proposals suggest to eliminate the unofficial seven-minute grace period between classes starting as early as fall 2018, in anticipation of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences’s move to its new Allston campus in 2020.
Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris presented the proposals to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at their monthly meeting Tuesday. The proposals aim to spread out courses more evenly throughout the academic day and week to reduce course scheduling conflicts for students. They also would allow for adequate pass time once FAS expands to a second campus.
“The great richness of our catalog needs to be made available to our students,” Harris said. “All of this requires a fundamental rethinking, so that we indeed can have a schedule that’s built around academics.”
While administrators have not drafted formal legislation for schedule changes, Harris said he hopes to begin that process in the fall of 2016 and have courses scheduled under the new system during the 2018 fall semester, two years before the move to Allston. In a memo describing the proposed changes, Harris wrote that the scheduling would require “a proper regulatory regime that does away with ‘non-compliant times' and other endearing and unique features of  ‘Harvard time.’”
The proposals recommend staggering course start times across the Cambridge and Allston campuses, with the first of the two proposals suggesting that instruction begin at 8:45 a.m. in Cambridge, and 30 minutes later on the Allston campus. Under that proposal, students would have 45 minutes of commute time between Cambridge and Allston, and 75 minutes for the return. Within a particular campus, students would have 15 minutes for a passing period.
At the meeting, SEAS Dean Francis J. Doyle III elaborated on a variation of this proposal, which would increase the 30-minute stagger between classes to 45 minutes, allowing for a symmetric 60-minute passing time both to and from the Allston campus.
The second option Harris proposed suggests expanding instruction time on Fridays, recasting Wednesday as a flexible day for scheduling long seminars. Classes that now meet twice a week would meet either on Mondays and Thursdays or on Tuesdays and Fridays.
Currently, more than 80 percent of courses in FAS meet between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., and only a minority meet on Fridays, Harris said. In addition, courses have varied lengths—55, 85, 115, and 145 minutes, for example—and often overlap, he added.
During the discussion period that followed Harris’s presentation, some faculty members raised concerns that extending the academic workday would negatively impact faculty with childcare responsibilities, and that students may not attend courses scheduled in the early mornings and evenings.
Brigette A.B. Libby, a lecturer in Classics and resident dean of Pforzheimer House, also expressed concern that the second proposal might lead to students in some departments “having a sort of untenable Wednesday,” chock-full of seminars not evenly spread across the week.
Also at the meeting, during an open question period, Government professor Harvey C. Mansfield ’53 criticized the terminology used in a recent University-wide sexual assault prevention report, calling it a “perfect marriage of social science and political correctness.”
University President Drew G. Faust said Harvard’s efforts to prevent sexual assault have “been about respect, indeed about safety...about human beings treating each other with the dignity that human beings deserved.”
“We felt we needed to address this in every possible dimension,” she added. “This place is nothing if it is not a community in which we treat each other with dignity and respect.”
FAS members also approved a merger between the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies and the Standing Committee on the Ph.D. in Film and Visual Studies. Starting July 1, VES will offer a doctoral program in Film and Visual Studies, a first for the 50-year-old, undergraduate-only department.
At the start of the meeting, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith formally introduced new Dean of Arts and Humanities Robin Kelsey and announced new appointments to the Faculty Council, the highest elected body in FAS. The new members are Government professor Danielle S. Allen, Statistics professor Joseph K. Blitzstein, History professor Vincent Brown, Psychology professor Joshua W. Buckholtz, East Asian Languages and Civilizations professor David L. Howell, Comparative Literature lecturer Sandra Naddaff, and History of Art and Architecture professor Jennifer L. Roberts.

Four current Harvard students will embark on Red Bull’s “Can You Make It” Challenge on April 12, trekking through Europe with only Red Bull cans as currency.
A team of three College seniors—Madeline C. Hung ’16, Nina L. Hooper ’16, and Hanna Evensen ’16—have qualified to participate in the challenge alongside 165 student teams from more than 50 countries around the world. Masahiro L. Kusunoki ’17 has joined two friends from Japan on another team.
“The Red Bull Challenge just seemed like such an awesome and crazy opportunity, especially with it being senior spring and potentially not having the chance to take off and do something like this in the coming years when we have real jobs and might be separated by large states or bodies of water,” Hung said.
Teams will start off at five different locations throughout Europe and will have one week to travel more than 600 miles. Along the way, teams must visit certain “Red Bull checkpoints” and complete numerous challenges, the results of which determine each team’s final score. The winning team will be awarded a trip to Europe, with transportation and accommodation expenses paid for.
During the seven days, each team will only have 24 Red Bull cans at their disposal to trade for food, accommodation, and transportation. In order to limit their transactions and make good use of their time, the all-Harvard team, “Seeing Red,” plans to sleep on buses and trains as they make their way to their final destination, Hooper said.
Kusunoki said his team, which competed in the Japanese qualifying rounds, has no idea what they will do when they get to Europe because there has been very little information as of yet from Red Bull.
“They haven’t told us the checkpoint, they haven’t told us the rules, they haven’t given us a sponsor or emergency contact,” he said.
Although teams are not allowed to make formal arrangements in Europe before the challenge starts, Seeing Red has been active on social media given that part of their team’s final score comes from votes on websites including Facebook. Furthermore, members of Seeing Red said they have been reaching out to the Harvard Alumni Association and Harvard clubs across Europe.
“We really think that capitalizing on the huge network of Harvard alumni would be really, really useful to get them engaged and get them to spread the word,” Hooper said.
The students are preparing for an austere trip, with Seeing Red bringing dry shampoo in anticipation of a week without many opportunities to shower. They say they are unsure of what they can acquire with 24 cans of Red Bull.
“We are most afraid of having to eat day old pizza out of a trashcan in a back alleyway in Rome after having spent all our Red Bull,” Hung said jokingly. “But, I’m not too worried about it.”
If the team ever finds itself in danger or facing starvation, they have the option of pulling out their phones or wallets, but that would disqualify them from the challenge. Students said they are not very concerned about dire circumstances, though.
As for worries about work piling up back in Cambridge, Kusunoki said he is doing his best to finish as much as possible before he goes. He has spoken with his professors, who he said are all supportive of his undertaking.
Hung, Hooper, and Evensen said they are especially excited for the chance to compete against a Yale team, “the Red Bull Dogs,” who also qualified for the challenge. The two teams have been in communication with each other, and the competition is heating up.

With final clubs at the top of the agenda for many administrators at Harvard College, another group less historically involved in undergraduate social life is scrutinizing the organizations: the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body.
William F. Lee ’72, the Corporation’s senior fellow, and the rest of the 13-member governing board “regularly” meet with Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana to consider how the College should oversee the clubs, Lee said in an interview Tuesday. Last month, a task force dedicated to studying sexual assault prevention released its final set of recommendations, specifically calling on the College to develop a plan to address “the problems presented by final clubs” by the end of the semester.

“Dean Khurana has been giving special attention to the final clubs and he has worked with some of us specifically on this issue over time, and he’s come to the Corporation and talked about ideas and possibilities,” Lee said.
Khurana has refused to detail forthcoming recommendations for final clubs or rule out any policy proposals. When asked about how Amherst approached the presence of single sex social groups—Amherst banned undergraduate enrollment in Greek life in 2014—Lee said he is working with Khurana as Khurana crafts recommendations specific to Harvard.
One of the task force’s subcommittees suggested administrators bar undergraduate membership in final clubs. Khurana and Michael D. Smith, dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, are in the process of formulating their final proposals, according to Lee.
“We’re in a situation where we don’t own the clubs. We don’t own the real estate; we don’t own the clubs; they’re managed by independent boards,” Lee said. “But they have an association with Harvard and their membership is overwhelmingly Harvard students. So I think that what we’re trying to do is look for a solution that's right for Harvard.”
Beyond the task force’s report, Lee said the Corporation has discussed whether the single gender clubs’ membership policies are inconsistent with University values.
“[The clubs] are basically determining membership on the basis of gender only or some other exclusive basis are things that we need to consider and to decide whether they are consistent with the values of the University. [Khurana] has reported regularly to the Corporation, I have worked with him directly,” he said.
Over the past few years, College administrators have amped up scrutiny of the final clubs, a set of private social organizations that maintain properties off campus. Since the 1980s, when the male clubs split ties with the College after refusing to go co-ed, the groups have enjoyed a formal independence from the University, and Harvard administrators have largely left them alone.
Increasingly, though, Khurana and other administrators at the College—concerned about the prevalence of sexual assault and membership practices in the clubs—have pressured the organizations to go co-ed.
Last month, the sexual assault task force lambasted the groups for a culture “often inimical to Harvard’s mission.” The report devoted more than three of its 20 pages to a detailed condemnation of the “deeply misogynistic attitudes” and “sexual entitlement” perpetuated by the clubs.
In an interview earlier this month, University President Drew G. Faust—a member of the Corporation—also criticized the clubs, and echoed Lee’s support for Khurana’s actions.
“The particular means and instruments for addressing [the final clubs] are ones that we will be devising over the coming weeks and I await [Khurana’s] recommendation to see what direction that should take,” Faust said. “But the report of the task force certainly reinforces in my mind the broader concerns of inequity and discrimination that are at the heart of what the final clubs represent.”
Lee said some members of the Corporation were in final clubs when they were students on campus, though Lee said his personal experiences have not colored the way the he has approached the issue. Lee said he is not affiliated with a final club.
“I think if you think about the people on the Corporation, they bring a breadth of experience to the issue that allows us to look at it fairly and squarely and not necessarily through the prism of our own personal experience,” Lee said.
Under scrutiny from top University officials, several clubs have changed their membership and guest policies. Last week, the A.D. Club announced in an internal email it would host an “open Punching process” next year, institute a members-only policy, and mandate a University-advised “sexual assault prevention training program” for its undergraduate members.
The Fox Club and the Spee Club each accepted women as members for the first time last fall.

This past weekend, the Harvard women’s track and field team sent competitors across the country to race in three separate meets. Though the meet locations varied from California to Florida to Texas, one characteristic remained the same across the board—Crimson success.
When all was said and done, Harvard came away with four Olympic Trial qualifying athletes across five different events. Seniors Paige Kouba and Autumne Franklin, sophomore Courtney Smith, and freshman Gabby Thomas all came away from the weekend with times that put them in the running for a bid to represent the United States this August in Rio de Janeiro, although qualifying for Trials is just the first step in a long process.
“I was obviously very happy, but not jumping off the walls or anything, because—not in a cocky way—but it’s kind of just one box to check off,” Franklin said. “I still plan to hit the A standard, which means I can actually go to the Olympics and compete, and I’m also still hoping to run a lot faster.”
Franklin’s stab at the Olympic podium comes in the 400 hurdles event, as the senior co-captain came in second at the Florida Relays this past weekend with a time of 56.81, good enough to pass the mark for USA’s Track and Field Olympic Trials, to be held this upcoming July in Eugene, Ore.
Classmate and co-captain Kouba is familiar with the setting of the Olympic Trials, as the Eugene native has volunteered at the past two renditions of the meet.
“I’ve gone the last two Trials as a volunteer on the basket crew, carrying gear for the athletes, so I was on the track, but in a little bit of a different capacity,” Kouba said. “It’s a lifelong dream of mine…. [Franklin] and I talked over spring break about how this is our last season with Harvard, and I think we both really appreciate how special that is, and we want to make the most of it.”
Kouba will be representing Harvard in the steeplechase, having set a Crimson record on Saturday at the Stanford Invitational. Her 9:50.21 for a 3,000 meter run is also the second best time in Ivy League history, coming in just shy of three seconds under the automatic qualification time.
On the other end of the spectrum, the youngest Olympic Trials qualifier for the Crimson is Thomas, who had already qualified for Trials at the Raleigh Relay in North Carolina on March 28. Her 23.18 in the 200 meter dash not only propelled her to Eugene, but also beat the then-best NCAA time.
This past weekend, Thomas qualified for her second event—the 100 meter dash. Finishing the race in 11.30 seconds, Thomas shattered the program record by almost three tenths of a second. She then went on to break her own 200 time, shaving off 0.43 seconds from her time the previous weekend to bring it down to 22.75. She is currently ranked 10th in the nation for the 100 and second in the 200, 0.05 seconds behind Arkansas’s Taylor Ellis-Watson.
“After the race, I went over to my coach, and he told me...the good news [that] I made the Olympic Trials,” Thomas said after her race March 28. “I was so excited...really pumped. I immediately just called my mom.”
Rounding out the quad of Olympic Trial qualifiers, Smith is a second-year distance runner whose time of 32:08.32 in the 10K at the Stanford Invitational brought her the eighth-best time in the nation and also put her almost 20 seconds ahead of the cutoff for trials.
For Smith, the high-standing results came earlier than previously expected, as she had her eyes set on the 2020 Games and did not expect to qualify for the Trials in Rio.
“I hadn’t really thought about expectations for the Trials yet, actually, but I guess just going in there and getting good experience [will be good] since hopefully this isn’t the last Trials for me. My goal would be making the 2020 Olympics,” Smith said. “It’s a cool place, and you never know what’s going to happen…. If someone catches a bad day. I’m just going to go for it and not be intimidated.”
With a spread of youth and leadership among the qualifiers, each athlete will have a support system going into July’s Trials, which should push each competitor to their full potential while providing them with an understanding of the training process.
There are also hopes that the success of the four will instill an expectation in Cambridge to stride farther as the track and field program continues to grow and improve in coming years.
“It feels good to know that with me being a leader on the team, we’re doing probably the best that we’ve ever done since I’ve been here,” Frankin said. “I just hope that us doing well and having the leaders on the team—me and Paige—inspires people and motivates people. I would hope that we’re fostering a culture of greatness and striving towards greatness and helping to inspire good lifestyle habits and ambition towards excellence.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Monday night, I couldn’t take my eyes off my laptop. Not because I had an essay due, but because there was a tense, back-and-forth championship game coming down to the wire. I’m talking, of course, about the epic Nova-UNC game (shout-out to Kris Jenkins for finishing off the most memorable college game I’ve ever seen).
Yet while Jenkins was writing a new chapter in NCAA tournament lore, there was another tense championship game unfolding about 2,500 miles away from Houston over in Kamloops, British Columbia. It was the final of the International Ice Hockey Federation’s Women’s World Championships between bitter rivals the United States and Canada. And it had a Crimson flavor to it.
Former Harvard co-captains Michelle Picard and Emerance Maschmeyer were part of the rosters for the United States and Canada, respectively, leaving the two to go against each other after years of donning the Crimson H together and protecting the Harvard goal.
Picard, who was on the ice in the 2012 Sochi Olympics when the Red, White, and Blue fell to Canada in the title game, helped the United States pick up the gold on Monday while playing on the second pair. The Taunton, Mass., native was part of a formidable defensive unit that conceded a mere two goals in five tournament games and held the potent Canada attack to just one goal in 132 minutes of play between the two teams.
While the blue-liner—who logged a plus-4 rating in the tournament—will return to Cambridge with the gold, it was Maschmeyer who walked away as one of the stars of the tournament.
Playing on the same ice her brother Bronson once played on as a member of the Western Hockey League’s Kamloop Blazers, Maschmeyer had a breakout performance on the international stage.
Chosen as the starter for Canada’s opening game against Team USA, the Bruderheim, Alberta, native dazzled in goal, making save after unbelievable save.
The former Harvard captain opened the tournament with an impressive 35 saves against a potent USA attack. While Canada lost the game, 3-1, Maschmeyer kept the game close before an empty netter with 20 seconds remaining sealed the final score.
That performance was merely the start for Maschmeyer.
The senior would go on to play in all five games of the tournament, starting three of them—including both matchups against the United States—while conceding only four goals over 191 minutes of time between the sticks.
In her final performance on Tuesday, Maschmeyer provided 33 saves in over 72 minutes of playing time, shutting out the USA and withstanding barrages of shots late in the game until Boston College senior Alex Carpenter poked a loose puck past the goalie in overtime to give Team USA the gold. For her efforts, Maschmeyer was named the tournament’s top goaltender.
As I processed the performances and watched their highlights on loop, I came to a sad realization: we’ll never get to see them in a Crimson uniform again.
It’s funny how you don’t appreciate or fully realize how important someone is until that person’s gone. Next year I’ll return to the press box overlooking Bright-Landry’s rink, but no longer will I see the names of the seniors I saw on the lineup sheet every game. No longer will we get to see them skate alongside the rest of their teammates.
Gone will be Maschmeyer and Picard, two of the most decorated players in Harvard history. Both came in as highly touted recruits and exceeded expectations with both the Crimson and their international squads during their time in Cambridge.
Maschmeyer leaves as one of the most prolific netminders in Harvard history, holding the school record for career saves with 2,538. Meanwhile, Picard was a stalwart on the blue line, recording a plus-103 rating for her career to go along with 53 points. The commanding presence of the two seniors in the back end will no longer be there, leaving a large hole.
Also gone will be classmates Miye D’Oench, Jessica Harvey, and Mary Parker, athletes who left sizeable marks of their own on the program.
D’Oench, an offensive spark for Harvard over the past three years, ended her career with 64 goals and 122 points, becoming just the 24th Crimson athlete to break the 100-point barrier. Parker, who was injured early in the season, led the team with 39 points during its run to the national championship game in 2015, where Harvard fell short against Minnesota. Harvey provided depth as a constant presence for the Crimson on the second and third lines.
As I watched replays of Villanova’s trophy ceremony the next day, I couldn’t help but notice the respect and praise being directed towards seniors Ryan Arcidiacono and Daniel Ochefu for all they had done to lead the Wildcats to the title. Writing this column, I feel the same level of respect and admiration for the women’s ice hockey seniors that will leave Harvard this year.
Their success at multiple levels demonstrates the talent of each of those players and showcases the impact they have had on an already storied Crimson program. While they might not suit up for Harvard anymore, their commitment and impact will always be appreciated and felt.
While only time will tell what each senior accomplishes after Harvard, both on and off the ice, I know one thing for sure: I’m already looking forward to seeing Maschmeyer, Picard, and the rest of the seniors suit up once again, wherever it might be.

Now take a look back at which letter you picked the most:
Strawberry (A): You're friends with everyone. You’re a very versatile person and fit into a ton of different kinds of situations. You compliment others very well. (Fun fact: Scientifically, strawberries aren’t “berries.” They’re accessory fruits. But we at Flyby like them so much that they’re on this quiz anyway.)
Blackberry (B): People that don't know you might find you to be kind of horrible, but to the few people you’re close to, you're loyal forever, and they can always count on you to be there for them.
Banana (C): You don't really fit in anywhere. You're the kid that has everyone going, "She doesn't even go here." Your role in friend groups is really ambiguous. But everyone still thinks you’re cool.
Cranberry (D): People think you’re sweet, but that’s because you cover up your bitter and sour personality with a sugary façade. Once you get down to the core, all that’s left is cynicism.
Deadly nightshade (E): You're just an awful person. You're poisonous to people around you, and literally kill any and all chance of relationships with others. It would be best if you existed in isolation.
Yours Botanically,Flyby
