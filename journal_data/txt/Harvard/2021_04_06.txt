Barack Obama claims that writing a book was “hardly a financial plan” — an ironic statement considering his almost 800-page memoir has made it onto many bestseller lists, sold millions of copies, and certainly made its author a tidy sum in the process. In addition to chronicling the life of the 44th President of the United States, from his youthful days in Hawaii to his many meetings in the oval office implementing world-changing policy, “A Promised Land” outlines Obama’s concerns for the future of politics, as well as his cautious optimism for the future of the United States of America and the world.
Obama uses much of his memoir to explain himself and his decisions in office. He details policy rationales and thought processes, while also expressing frustration with fellow politicians and media outlets for only paying attention to the often incorrect, but loudest and most entertaining, voices. As he says, “Sometimes your most important work involved the stuff nobody noticed.” In Obama's opinion, the press was overly focused on his mistakes. That said, Obama himself spends a lot of time in "A Promised Land" explaining things that went wrong. He says philosophically, "I knew a time would come when I would disappoint" his supporters.
Most importantly, throughout the memoir Obama emphasises the importance of honesty and graciousness. Obama sings an ode to the honest and thoughtful man, lamenting that in our day and age, those his mother considered “.. bullies, cheats, and self-promoters seemed to be doing quite well, while those she considered good and decent people seemed to get screwed an awful lot.” Obama’s dissatisfaction with current partisan, radicalized politics, informs everything he hoped to safeguard and warn against: the tumultuous Trumpist era to come, which “would threaten to blot out everything — your previous positions; your stated principles; even what your own senses, you eyes and ears, told you to be true.”
This is not to say that Obama’s tone is one of a bitter, slighted man, writing “I told you so!” over and over again for 800 pages. Instead he moves on, stating there is much work left to do and optimistically pushing for civic participation, peace, and less partisanship in the hopes that we as a nation will chart a new path forward. Throughout the memoir, Obama incorporates dialogue from conversations with his daughters, parents, and Michelle in order to introduce complex questions about morality and what it means to be American.
Obama is an eloquent and scholarly writer whose sentences and expansive vocabulary provide imagery and infuse life into his stories of bureaucratic wrangles and soporific senate sessions. He even manages to add excitement to budget overhauls. Nevertheless, all the colorful dialogue and minute details also add to the page count of his book. Length is not the only way "A Promised Land" resembles a Russian novel: Each page teems with the names of everyone Obama seems to have met or worked with, from minor functionaries to major political players — everyone gets a mention!
Sprinkled with anecdotes, regrets, advice, hard-learned lessons, and Obama’s characteristic dry sense of humor, Obama’s memoir reminds us that “maybe politics could be less about power and positioning and more about community and connection,” thus providing readers with a deeply inspirational text that reminds us: no matter what, “Try anyway.”

In her fifth studio album, “LILAC,” IU embraces the symbolism of lilac flowers as memories of youth to bid an emotional farewell to her 20s and say a hopeful hello to her 30s. At 29 years old, the Korean singer, songwriter, actress, and “Nation’s Little Sister” said that she crafted this album with love and gratitude for all the people who supported her during the musical projects of her 20s — from her single album “The Spring of Twenty” to, finally, “LILAC.” To commemorate this huge milestone in her life, IU challenged herself to work with new composers for each song, resulting in a masterful album of delightfully different genres, styles, and stories.
“LILAC” is well worth the four-year wait, as it speaks to the true breadth of IU’s musical ability. The album’s blend of sounds stems from the fact that IU created “LILAC” from the perspective of a producer, as opposed to that of a songwriter. As a surprising, yet welcome addition to her discography, IU worked with a variety of different producers — including WOOGIE, Sumin, Junny, and AMKU’s Lee Chan-hyuk — and swapped her usual light and airy style for an upbeat and retro-influenced one. The album creates a feeling of both weightlessness and playfulness and, while stylistically varied, stays true to IU’s typical sound.
With a perfect blend of rhythm, guitar, strings, and bright synth accents, the album’s disco- and city pop-inspired title track, “LILAC,” will surely evoke a sense of both nostalgia and optimism among listeners. Its groovy instrumentals and frolicsome chorus make the song feel almost like a spring breeze. City pop can often sound monotonous, but IU’s melodic vocals inject the track with energy and positivity. With lyrics such as “Take good care of our last moment in the page / Could this last goodbye be any more perfect?” and “Love me only ‘till this spring,” the singer bids farewell to the joyful memories of her youthful 20s that shine through the track’s pleasant and refreshing sound.
In another fun departure from her usual sound, “Coin” showcases IU’s newfound rapping skills and incorporates a brassy funk backbone, compounded with strong, fast-paced percussion and bass guitar, to capture the intensity of her 20s. The overall song is a metaphor for IU’s intense dedication to her craft when she sings, “I can’t die, I’m all-in.” Here she is comparing the adrenaline of high-stakes betting to that of working constantly on her music and projects. IU admitted that while she does not regret much from her 20s, she wants to focus on living more than working in her 30s in an effort to avoid burnout as a result of her relentless work ethic. Nonetheless, “Coin” is the perfect soundtrack for a high-intensity, adrenaline-pumping scene that has a lot at stake for the main characters.
An IU album is incomplete without a tear-inducing ballad, and “My sea” fully embraces that role for a whopping five minutes and 16 seconds: a choice composer Jehwi made to represent IU’s birthday, May 16th. Once again, IU demonstrates incredible vocal ability by not only sustaining a technically demanding F5 note but also vocally painting an emotional journey of finding oneself in the midst of chaos like in the endless sea.
However, the album has its shortcomings. The pre-release track, “Celebrity,” is unfortunately oversaturated with basic Western electro-pop synths and awkward dance breaks that distract from IU’s unique musicality. “Ah puh,” however, achieves what “Celebrity” failed to do; the playful track incorporates dainty rhythms with an addictive melody as an adult take on her old style, providing listeners with a delightful and fresh departure from IU’s typical sound.
In the aptly-named final track of the album, “Epilogue,” IU poetically sings, “Were you happy to know me? / Were you happy to love me?” which she immediately follows up with, “If you answer 'yes' to all of these questions / With that alone, my life will be okay / Oh, it’ll hold enough meaning.” IU pours her heart out to listeners on this reflective and lovely song paired with acoustic guitar, soft drums, and crackles from a record player. The track’s lyrics are arguably the best of this album, if not of IU’s songwriting career. She sings of wanting to have positively touched the life of someone she loves dearly, even in the smallest ways — “Do the long memories with me make you laugh even a bit? / Are you still proud that we were together at some point in life?” Ultimately, she perfectly captures feeling content in life after finding “your person” then being validated and recognized by them. IU is able to weave years of gratitude and love into this emotional homage for everyone, especially her fans known as Uaenas, who has been with her throughout her 20s. And for the record, the answer to all of IU’s questions is a resounding “yes.”
Nearly 13 years into her career, IU continues to amaze her fans, redefining what it means to be a K-pop singer, songwriter, and producer. Much like the dual meaning of the Korean word “insa,” which can mean both a farewell or greeting in Korean, “LILAC” captures the sentiments of her 20s and lays the foundation for the future of the artist’s career as she enters the next chapter of her life.

“Judas and the Black Messiah,” the latest film from director Shaka King, blends the historical with the contemporary, the political with the dramatic. The title employs a biblical allusion as a metaphor for the relationship between Fred Hampton — chairman of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party, portrayed here by Daniel Kaluuya — and Bill O’Neal, his confidante-turned-informant-to-the-FBI, portrayed by LaKeith Stanfield. At its core are themes of brotherhood and betrayal, as well as an overarching sense of tragedy, which is heightened by the youth of the two men (Hampton being only 21 when he was fatally shot by the FBI, O’Neal only 17 when first coerced into working with the FBI). The film plays with this dynamic, as both actors are much older than the characters they portray, but it still weighs heavy as one tragic aspect of an incredibly complex story.
On March 15, the Academy announced the list of nominations for this year’s Oscars: Notably, both Kaluuya and Stanfield were nominated in the category for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, though Stanfield’s role in the film was arguably better suited for a nomination for Best Actor in a Leading Role. In February, the film was similarly snubbed by the Golden Globes, with Kaluuya up for (and, eventually, winning) Best Supporting Actor and Stanfield not represented at all.
The Oscars snub comes as a shock, considering the critical acclaim for both actors’ performances; Kaluuya has been heralded as “stocky and sensational, [delivering] with power and aplomb;” Stanfield, as delivering a “performance [that] holds a nuance...the strongest asset of the film.” Director Shaka King spoke on the unfolding power of Stanfield’s acting presence: “I want actors to surprise themselves, and [Stanfield] does that all the time; that’s something that he is known for. Maybe it hasn’t been expressed that way, but that’s why you like watching him.” Stylistically, King centers O’Neal’s voice in this telling of the story, setting Stanfield up to be slated as a leading role nominee. So, why was he overlooked?
In an interview with NME that came out just before the Oscar nominations were announced, Stanfield gave almost-prophetic insight: “To be honest with you, most Black films that I’m a part of — or even the ones I’m not in — the way that they’re critiqued is annoying. Because I think a lot of people doing the critique don’t really understand the [Black] experience, so they kind of miss it a little bit.” He recognizes a real issue in the film industry: Even in years past, there have been plenty of well-crafted films that center the Black experience, although these films are often left out of the spotlight or disproportionately recognized when awards season comes around.
The 2021 Oscars will take place on April 25 — and it’s anyone’s guess how things will go down. In “Judas and the Black Messiah,” Kaluuya and Stanfield skillfully enact a story of tragedy, both political and personal; Stanfield’s Oscars snub represents a stinging tragedy in its own right.

It’s pretty standard nowadays for musicians to promote their new music on social media, but no one does it quite like Lil Nas X. Connoisseurs of his work knew when he announced the release of his latest single “Montero (Call Me By Your Name)” that the real entertainment wasn’t to be found in the song itself, nor in the music video, but in the already erupting controversy surrounding its release.
Filled with Biblical allusions and references to Lil Nas X’s own sexual experiences with a man, the song and accompanying music video seem designed to elicit religious conservative outrage. One of the best lines of the song, “If Eve ain’t in your garden, you know that you can / Call me when you want” occurs as Lil Nas X, playing Adam (or perhaps Eve) in the Garden of Eden, succumbs to the temptations of a snake-like male figure. In another now-infamous scene, he gives Satan a lap dance, before snapping Satan’s neck and ascending to the throne. It’s jarring, interesting, and high camp in a way most mainstream artists could never pull off — but it’s not the main story here.
“Montero” itself is catchy and lyrically clever, though not particularly bold even considering its subject matter. The accompanying music video, though captivatingly provocative, is similarly on the flashier side of average. (A jaw-dropping pole-dancing scene, in which Lil Nas X descends to hell clad in boxers and knee-high boots, also bears a concerning degree of resemblance to the pole-dancing in FKA twigs’ “Cellophane” music video, a fact Lil Nas X has acknowledged.) All of it had been done before; the difference now was in who was doing it.
For Lil Nas X, it didn’t matter whether the song or the video merited any artistic praise so long as the right people took umbrage at it. And they did. Governor Kristi Noem of South Dakota cited American children’s “God-given eternal soul” in defence of a firm stance against Lil Nas X’s “Satan sneakers,” which dropped along with the song. Conservative pundits like Candace Owens took to Twitter to howl their disapproval. They had no idea what laid in store for them.
Lil Nas X is a particularly adept spider in the complex and reverberating web that is social media. Nobody can play the Twitter game quite like him. One by one he took aim at the army of high-horsed disapprovers and picked them off with brutal precision. To Governor Noem he shot back, “ur a whole governor and u on here tweeting about some damn shoes. do ur job!” To pro-gun activist Kaitlin Bennett’s racist jab “Do you still see your dad?” it was the concise and time-honoured “yep and i might fuck yours.” Bennett responded with the singularly bewildering Tweet, “At least I can procreate,” followed by a frog emoji, a symbol recently co-opted by white nationalist movements, and a cup of tea emoji. Against such opponents, Lil Nas X couldn’t have looked better if he tried.
With “Montero” and all its half-manufactured controversy, Lil Nas X has hit his golden age. Come a year or so, the Internet’s great spotlight may not shine so forgivingly. But for now, he has harnessed all the power of his Twitter talent, and “Montero” is a star in the Billboard sky.

At first glance, Christie’s March 11 auction seemed like yet another episode in art’s never ending telenovela of collectors scrambling to secure a masterpiece. The bidding opened at $100. The final price reached over $69.3 million. But the artist was not Warhol and the medium not canvas. The London-based auction house’s highest-selling lot of 2021 so far can hardly even be called an item. The piece in question, Beeple’s “Everydays – The First 5000 Day”, is a completely digital work of art — a non-fungible token, or NFT.
On a fundamental level, NFTs are a form of cryptocurrency. They are stored in digital wallets and secured with “keys,” which are essentially long passwords. With the current technology, they would require millions of years to hack, making them essentially unstealable as long as their owners don't share the keys. The major difference between NFTs and regular cryptocurrencies is that, as the name suggests, they are “non-fungible,” or unique. A single bitcoin is a single bitcoin. That is not the case with NFTs, as they contain different information, which in turn determines their value. Cryptocurrencies and NFTs could be compared to canvases and paintings. Two identical, blank canvases are fully interchangeable, or in other words, fungible. Two paintings, even though they might exist on canvases, are not. In short: unlike other cryptocurrencies, NFTs are unique and contain unique data, which means they can be used to store information about and to sell art.
The wording here is crucial. The files containing the digital artwork are simply too large for any cryptocurrency to hold. The data stored in an NFT is not a copy of a painting, a video, or a song, but rather a link to it on an outside platform. That way, it’s more akin to a purchase certificate from the work’s creator that lets the token’s new owner loudly proclaim to the world: “I got this first.”
“What the buyer gets is essentially a long string of numbers and letters. It’s a code that exists on the Ethereum blockchain that will be dropped into their Ethereum wallet,” says Noah Davis, Christie’s expert on post-war and contemporary art, in an interview with CNBC while noting they will get separately “a gigantic JPG.”
There’s nothing preventing the work linked to in an NFT from being distributed by people who don’t own it. There’s nothing preventing the work’s author from distributing it, as the purchase of an NFT more often than not doesn’t mean obtaining copyrights from the artist. Vignesh Sundaresan, the man who bought the NFTs “Everydays,” decided to share it online, in full resolution. What’s more, they still rely on the traditional web for hosting the actual, digital artworks, which means that if a domain goes down, the token is reduced to nothing more than a proof of purchase.
If the owner of an NFT doesn’t own the rights to the work (other than the one to display it), and others could easily get it — in this case the JPG — for free, then why spend millions on it? It’s easy to dismiss NFTs as a fad, the art world’s equivalent of fidget spinners, especially in an era when adding the word “blockchain” to the name of an ice tea company makes its stock price double, but the ease is deceiving. Buying a photograph, just like buying an NFT, does not have to mean buying the copyright. A perfect copy of it could be printed with ease, and the image is likely accessible to the public — And yet it’s not unheard of for one to fetch millions of dollars at an auction. Similarly, a first edition book, just like an original NFT, is going to be more expensive than a reprint, even if the design isn’t changed.
“I don’t think it’s a one-off … NFTs clearly are more than just an emerging, nascent collecting space,” says Davis. The words don’t seem like a mischaracterization considering the fact that this “cryptoart” has undeniable advantages over its traditional counterparts. Thanks to the cryptocurrency aspect of NFTs, purchases can be done with absolute privacy, an important consideration for the art-selling world, where most vendors and buyers choose to remain anonymous. The digital form eliminates the need for storage and insurance, and it also makes it easier for emerging artists to market their works directly to their audiences — in a way, levelling the field and reducing entry barriers. The blockchain technology allows for NFTs to be designed in such a way that the artist would receive royalties every time a token is resold. The egalitarian aspect is hardly limited to creators themselves. NFTs make art collecting more accessible than ever, with purchases possible in an instant without the need to leave home, a trend noticed even by Christie’s. “Of those 20+ initial bidders, only three were known to Christie’s,” Davis says.
Non-fungible tokens represent a sharp break with the tradition. They stretch the definition of ownership, force us to rethink what it means to collect art, and rely on technology that, to many, seems esoteric. For other phenomena such challenges could prove insurmountable, but NFTs manage to achieve something paradoxical; at the same time, they make life easier for newcomers and benefit the establishment of the art world.

Well before her long-awaited solo career began, Rosé understood one of music’s greatest contradictions: the daunting necessity of revealing deeply personal stories to unfamiliar audiences. Blackpink’s main vocalist, who released the single album “R” last month, discussed her creative process with producer Joe “Vince” Rhee in the 2020 documentary “BLACKPINK: Light Up the Sky.”
“That’s something I can’t do too easily,” she said of embracing the vulnerability inherent to the recording studio — the very quality that suffuses “R” with such sincere warmth and flair. The album’s B-side, “Gone,” laments past love and future loneliness in the timeless form of a forlorn guitar ballad.
Two years after first recording the track and just over two months after its widely acclaimed debut at Blackpink’s virtual concert “The Show,” Rosé finally shared the music video for “Gone” on April 4.
As the guitar intro plays, Rosé wakes up on a candlelit bathroom floor, slowly opening her eyes as if reluctant to leave a happy dream of the past. When she starts singing, the scene shifts to hint at the memory in question: Rosé smiling brightly while on the phone, surrounded by her namesake flowers. Among clusters of dyed blue roses lie far fewer red ones, suggesting the rarity of true love relative to sheer romantic artifice. Still more of the roses are purple — a potential reminder that most relationships fall somewhere in between.
“I’m tired of always waiting,” Rosé continues, as the video cuts to her doing just that at a nighttime bus stop. Then, she’s planning chess moves as a red rose blooms in a vase, doomed to wilt before its artificial counterparts on the wallpaper lining the room. Her opponent later makes a brief appearance, seemingly attempting to move a pawn two spaces over another. (Now there’s a misstep that might justify the line, “It’s hard for me to blame you when you were already lost.”)
The attempt to preserve the rose in water echoes the pre-chorus’ longing to “be the one / But to you we’re already done.” During these lines, Rosé’s downcast stare at her smartphone couldn’t feel further from her earlier laughter into a retro handset. The first verse offers an explanation for this newfound silence: “I see you changed your number, that’s why you don’t get my calls.”
“Another story that’s sad and true,” Rosé begins the first chorus, rejecting the more common “sad but true” for a bold confrontation of her unhappy reality as she documents the story’s more hopeful moments with a vintage movie camera. “You had to be the one to let me down / To color me blue,” she sings, evoking the roses whose unnatural blue symbolizes the search for something impossible.
Meanwhile, vivid splashes of spilled wine and dripping candle wax foreshadow the red rose’s inevitable end, which in turn calls to mind the inscription of “Roses are dead, love is fake,” in Rosé’s music video for “On The Ground,” her solo album’s lead single. Just before the last chorus, a striking image of the flower on fire only cements this message.
When the video’s second half introduces clips of Rosé in front of a projector, she never tries to relive the cheerful memories on the wall by looking in their direction. Instead, in the penultimate scene, she reaches for the projector’s glaring beam of light — which, of course, remains as intangible as ever.
The final scene again shows Rosé with a glass of red wine. Except now, she sits alone at the table, her eyes meeting the camera’s gaze as the shot fades out. “All my love is gone / Now you’re dead and gone,” the song ends, but Rosé’s nuanced acting and beautiful voice leave a lasting impression.

“A word of caution: Some of you may think you can get away with being naked from the waist down. Based on personal experience, I would advise against it.”
In a skit about how to look your best while teleconferencing, Roy Wood Jr. poked fun at the virtual format of the 26th Annual Critics’ Choice Awards, which took place on March 7. Following suit with other awards shows, this year’s ceremony was partially in-person and partially virtual, with Taye Diggs hosting from Santa Monica while presenters and nominees tuned in from around the globe. The digital format meant that the show’s usual pomp and circumstance were necessarily replaced with canned applause, awkwardly-paced interviews, and video call fumbles caused by faulty internet connection (celebrities, they’re just like us!). And though the disembodied “Virtual Tables'' of actors and actresses showed us firsthand that glamorous attire doesn’t ameliorate the awkwardness of Zoom socializing, the show went on, recognizing achievements across film and television over the past year.
The forgotten sibling of awards season, the CCAs don’t tend to field much press. Nevertheless, the ceremony has consistently proven to be one of the most accurate predictors of Oscars success in terms of nominations and wins, and with the Oscars postponed until April, there’s still ample time for predictions. But ratings for even the most “prestigious” awards shows have been on a steep downward trend in recent years, and a global pandemic has, of course, upended most conventions of the entertainment industry over the past year. Moviegoing has dwindled due to production shutdowns and stalled release dates, and even with expanding streaming services, most people likely haven’t had the opportunity to see a majority of film entries. With interest in awards shows at an all-time low, and box office metrics largely irrelevant as a predictive tool, do the CCAs even tell us anything? And does it matter whether or not they do?
What this year’s Critics Choice Awards did do was deliver a show whose nominees and winners possibly signal small movements in the right direction for diversity and inclusion in Hollywood. The CCAs indicate that marginalized artists might receive the appreciation they deserve at this year’s Oscars — or so viewers can hope.
On the television front, the CCAs proceeded as expected. The show swept through its small-screen nominees with few surprises: Netflix’s “The Crown” led the pack in both nominations and wins, taking home Best Drama Series on top of three acting nominations for Josh O’Connor, Emma Corrin, and Gillian Anderson. Awards season favorite “Schitt’s Creek” carried nominations in the comedy categories and secured wins for both Daniel Levy and Catherine O’Hara.
But the show also corrected some of the Golden Globes’ most dubious nominee choices in its own list of nominees: The HBO series “I May Destroy You” picked up a nomination for Best Limited Series, after an incomprehensible snub at the Globes. Creator Michaela Coel, at long last, received recognition for her starring role in the show, appearing in the Critics Choice Best Actress in a Limited Series race. The Critics Choice Awards’ nominees list also showed some much-deserved love to the cast of “Lovecraft County,” who went largely unrecognized at the Golden Globes. This time around, four actors received nominations and Michael K. Williams took home the prize for Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for his work in the show.
Wishful thinking though it may be, the CCAs nominees and winners in its film categories seem to foretell a diverse cohort of nominees and storytellers come The Oscars. Well-positioned to pick up Oscar wins is Chloe Zhao’s “Nomadland.” Zhao’s ambient and reflective vignette took home several awards at the CCAs, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay, and slid easily into the Oscars’ Best Picture race. Additional CCAs nominations for acting (Best Actress for Frances McDormand), cinematography, and other technical categories at the CCAs indicate that the film, whose stylistic intrigue lies in Zhao’s skillful blurring of narrative cinema and documentary filmmaking, is well-deserving of its six oscar nominations. And Zhao’s Oscar nomination for Best Director has cemented a very exciting, very much overdue milestone in Oscars history: Zhao has become the first woman of color to receive a Best Director nomination at the Oscars.
Lee Isaac Chung’s “Minari'' racked up 10 total nominations at the Critics Choice Awards, was awarded Best Foreign Language Film, and saw newcomer Alan Kim take home the prize for Best Young Actor/Actress (The eight year old’s tearful acceptance speech was undoubtedly a highlight of the night and an adorable splash of genuine energy amidst a ceremony stilted by Zoom fatigue.) The Critics Choice Association seemed to appreciate Chung’s poignant tale of immigration and family resilience a bit more than the folks behind the Golden Globes. And it seems that this momentum has propelled the piece towards broader recognition in the ranks of Oscar nominees: like Nomadland, “Minari” also received six total nominations.
David Fincher’s “Mank,” a biographical drama examining the life and times of “Citizen Kane” co-writer Herman J. Mankiewicz, scored 12 nominations at the CCAs, including Best Picture, Director, Actor for Gary Oldman, and Supporting Actress for Amanda Seyfried. Some have noted that the film has underperformed thus far, receiving only one award at the CCAs and none at the Golden Globes. Nevertheless, it leads the pack in the Oscars race with a total of 10 nominations — though how many categories it will win is perhaps a separate question.
The stylish black comedy “Promising Young Woman” took home Best Original Screenplay and Best Actress for Carey Mulligan at the CCAs, and director Emerald Fennell was one of three women contenders in the Best Director category (all three women were also nominated for Golden Globes). And what’s more: Fennell has since been nominated for the Oscars’ Best Director race, meaning that for the first time in Oscars history, there will be two women competing in the category. Certainly watch out for “Promising Young Woman” at the Oscars in April, where it’s a five-category contender.
But perhaps the most important — and most simple — truth that the CCAs nominees and winners reveal is that representation in thoughtful storytelling matters and deserves to be recognized during awards season. Races for the Critics Choice film categories (even more so than those at the Golden Globes) recognized creatives telling thought-provoking social and political tales — historical and otherwise — that speak to our own times (and hopefully to Oscars voters).
“Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom” is a meditation on Black art and industry exploitation that should speak right to the studios it springs from: although it did not secure a Best Picture nomination at the Golden Globes, it did at the CCAs, and should certainly be a viable competitor at Oscars as well. The late Chadwick Boseman delivered a stunningly affecting performance as Ma Rainey’s disillusioned trumpeter, has now won both the Golden Globe and Critics Choice Awards for Best Actor, and is the clear frontrunner for the prize at the Oscars. Viola Davis’ performance as the film’s titular “Mother of the Blues” has earned her an Oscars nomination as well.
Several other films from Black filmmakers that received recognition at the CCAs tell a series of essential stories in temporal proximity: “One Night in Miami,” which follows a 1964 meeting of Malcom X, Muhammad Ali, Sam Cooke, and Jim Brown, collected several nominations at the CCA’s, including Best Director for Regina King in her directorial debut. “Da 5 Bloods,” a portrait of Black soldiers in Vietnam and the newest Spike Lee joint, breathed new life into the Vietnam War genre, but was snubbed by the Golden Globes and the Oscars alike, receiving only a Best Score nomination.
In addition, Shaka King’s “Judas and the Black Messiah” is a political biography that remains relevant to our contemporary moment and another Black-directed film that enjoyed visibility at the CCAs — though perhaps not enough. Some worry that the film’s revolutionary zeal and fearless portrayal of Black Panther Party Chairman Fred Hampton might turn off more conservative Oscars voters in the race for Best Picture at the Oscars, where it has earned a nomination (the film has picked up five Oscar nods total.) And although the film was absent from most major categories at the CCAs and the Golden Globes before it, Daniel Kaluuya’s stunning portrayal of Hampton sent the actor home with Best Supporting Actor at both shows. It’s certainly safe to say Kaluuya will be the clear frontrunner for the category at the Oscars.
This year’s CCAs may not have been the smoothest — but if its picks and selections provide any foresight at all to the Oscars, its recognition of filmmakers and actors of color provides some glimmer of hope for the future of inclusion in Hollywood.

In AJR’s most recent album, “OK Orchestra,” released on March 26, the trio of brothers stick to what they know and do well. Relying on their unique instrumentals in the pop space, AJR augments the mood and drama with synth-style additions to their music. The album in its entirety flows like any of the group’s other well-curated releases. The LP almost feels like one 45-minute song, but at times fails to truly deviate from their previous albums. “OK Orchestra” toys with the comedy and depth expected of the trio, while leaving the listener wanting just a bit more.
In its first track, “OK Overture,” the album is introduced with snappy and comic narration walking the listener through the story the remaining 12 songs will tell. It’s a fun addition to the album that does not detract from the overall theme or flow of the album. The catchy rhythm of the song, with nice instrumentation setting the stage for the rest of the album, previews the ups and downs of the songs that follow.
With a slurry of popular songs, the album plays out comfortably. “Bang!,” “Bummerland,” and “Way Less Sad,” all dropped as teasers for the album in the months leading up to the release in late March. Based on their critical acclaim, it seemed as if “OK Orchestra” would be a shoo-in for another knock-out album from a well-loved band.
“Bang — probably the most popular song in the mix — was initially planned to be included in the deluxe version of their previous album, but instead appears here. This bit of fluidity between the two albums and their noticeably similar sounds makes it seem as if “OK Orchestra,” although fleshed out and mature as an independent project, plays as a part two of their previous release.
In the last half of the album, the songs mature and stand out as uniquely a part of the current album. With the distinct sound of “Joe” and “The Trick,” AJR takes that step that “Bang!” couldn’t. “Joe” is a boppy coming-of-age story about an icon in school breaking away from the self-imposed need to find fulfilment through others. With an audience of school-aged people, “Joe” is an impressive lesson to mix into their upbeat, dance music.
“The Trick” breaks heavily from the rest of the album. This track has a warbled, entrancing vocal to start and sets the mood for an enthralling listen. Capitalizing on their talent as instrumentalists and electronic artists, AJR curates an incredibly unique experience in just the one song. It’s a welcome relief to have something to break up the monotony of the rest of the album.
Although not a perfect album, “OK Orchestra” breaks away from some of the stereotypical moods that AJR has created to do something entirely distinct and enjoyable. While there are moments that fail to showcase the group’s development since their last album, it’s refreshing to hear the talent of these three brothers really shine when they take those steps to craft something truly new to them and their genre.

With a release date in the middle of the pandemic’s second March, “The One” had the opportunity to thrive in a global market of streamers still stuck at home. With a striking cast of mostly unknown performers, the show dove into deep waters, trying to make a splash as one of Netflix’s freshest originals. Its eight episodes dropped simultaneously, basically begging for a good quarantine binge. But the show’s premise, following the emergence of a dating service so perfect that it guarantees love, sounds too good to be true — and it is.
The audience is introduced to three interwoven storylines about the people at the heart and the fringe of the new matchmaking service, aptly called “The One.” Hannah Ware stars as Rebecca Webb, the centerpiece of the show: a maniacal, scheming founder who gave up everything in the pursuit of her vision for helping people find love by pairing them based on their genetic makeup. Throughout the show, we see her flex her influence and power — never more so than in the first episode when Rebecca forces a politician, Elizabeth (Geraldine Alexander), to bend to her will by using her daughter’s match as leverage. These power plays continue throughout the season, but as she repeats the same approach each time, the impressiveness of her wealth and sway wear off. By the end, it’s almost unnoticeable.
The show contrasts Rebecca’s lifestyle against that of more down-to-earth characters through two other intersecting storylines. By weaving the three stories together, “The One” introduces starkly different, more relatable characters, adding depth to what would have otherwise been a very two-dimensional story. This multiplicity brings in a bit of normalcy compared to the elite corporate narrative of Rebecca. The two other threads follow married couple Hannah (Lois Chimimba) and Mark (Eric Kofi-Abrefa) and detective-inspector Kate Saunders (Zoë Tapper), and initially begin as starkly disjointed and seemingly unrelated but gradually intersect in moments that shape their lives and arcs. Weaving together people from dramatically different social classes, “The One” capitalizes on individual differences to bring out the humanity in its story.
These two background arcs serve to show the joys and downfalls of the service The One provides. Throughout their arc, Hannah and Mark are tested as Hannah searches for Mark’s match (the person The One deems your perfect genetic pair). As their story unfolds, it becomes a testament to the resiliency of true, authentic love — unadulterated by genetic testing and scientific tinkering. “The One” makes the case that we can’t always find the perfect love online — in fact, there is not an app for that.
Kate’s narrative on the other hand, is a beautiful and broken story about the trials The One can put people through. Kate matches with a Spanish woman from Barcelona named Sophia Rodriguez (Jana Pérez). After a freak accident thrusts Kate into the middle of Sophia’s fractured past, they discover whether they are truly the perfect match for one another. This dichotomy of one couple reaching romantic nirvana and another rejecting the push of technological love gives depth and realism to a story saturated with British futurism.
In the end, “The One” is a show that’s thoroughly entertaining, but nothing more. The acting leaves something to be desired, but the charismatic cast and intriguing story sets the stage for a good binge-worthy watch. There were opportunities to create larger commentary, but instead, the show came across as mediocre — enjoyable, but nothing special.

“This is a horror story,” Jamie Conklin, the protagonist and narrator of “Later,” repeats throughout Stephen King’s latest novel. As a boy, Jamie discovers that he can talk to the ghosts of the recently deceased; through this, he learns that the dead cannot tell lies. He does not intend to use this knowledge, but the people closest to him take advantage of his abilities for personal gain. Despite his repetition of Jamie’s mantra about this being a horror story, King does not deliver the gut-wrenching scares he has in the past. Rather, he melds his skillful knack for horror writing with an old-fashioned noir aesthetic. King falls flat in delivering anything worth reading, with a sluggish plot driven solely by an unconvincing narrator.
The young protagonist looks at the world through the lense of pop culture: blockbusters, Netflix shows, and gothic novels, with Bram Stoker’s “Dracula” at the forefront. Unexpectedly, they all serve as a tool for King to address questions about the meaning of literature, the relationship between creators and their editors, and finally what happens to a writer's legacy after their death. It is no coincidence that Jamie's first goal is to learn the details of an unfinished novel from Regis Thomas, a fictional bestselling author who died of a heart attack. The profound questions and overarching themes that King tries to tackle are the novel’s highpoint. But the surprising depth of these explorations, wholly uncharacteristic for “the king of horror,” does not make up for the book’s deficiencies. The premise is undeniably appealing, but “Later” fundamentally suffers from issues with both style and content.
“The trudging, flavorless prose is typical … the rough equivalent of a heaping plate of food from an all-you-can-eat buffet in a dubious roadside restaurant,” King writes in a fictional, snarky New York Times review of Regis Thomas’ book-within a book. It is hard to read the words as anything other than a display of self-awareness on King’s part. Indeed, the prose in this novel is pretty flavorless — typical for King, some would say.
The fact that “Later” does not deviate much from Stephen King’s standard repertoire in terms of style should not be a cause for concern on its own. While some of the entries in King’s catalogue are masterful and iconic, the bulk of his books are hardly Nobel Prize material. Nonetheless, he can usually be counted on to deliver an entertaining story. The book leaves no doubts as to what it perceives itself to be: The cover boldly asserts a crime story. Yet Jamie Conklin, the main character, seems certain it’s a horror. The mix should pose no difficulties for an author who reigns supreme over the latter and has had some fruitful ventures into the former with his Mr. Mercedes trilogy. But unfortunately in “Later,” King relegates the horror storytelling he’s had the most experience with to the passenger’s seat.
In fact, King’s broad pronouncements on the world and literature result in the elements of horror and crime being overshadowed. Despite ghosts and dark rituals, serial killers, murders and corrupt cops, “Later” reads like a Jane Austen-esque novel of manners, focusing more on the strained relationship between the protagonist and his mother than on the action itself. Because of this confusing emphasis, the book suffers from a narrative so disjointed that calling it a novel seems generous. It is more akin to a collection of three short stories, vaguely connected through Jamie. Three glimpses of plot action are drowned in a sea of fluff that does not contribute to anything, and are topped with an unjustifiable ten-page tangent about what might or might not have been a case of incest that masquerades as an impactful ending. Worse yet, Jamie might be the protagonist, but most notably he is a MacGuffin — as his ability drives the plot forward with all the grace of a bulldozer. “Later” could have been a respectable entry in King’s vast bibliography, a book that brings together what he shines at and spins it in a creative way. Unfortunately it ends up a hot mess[,] even by King’s standards.

America is divided. That much we know.
Threatened by the viral spread of disinformation and jeopardized by media business models that profit from polarization, the political middle ground is disappearing. Whether you’re a Democratic Party “socialist,” as 82 percent of Republicans characterized their counterparts in 2017, or a Republican Party “racist,” as 80 percent of Democrats reported in the same survey, members of both major political parties increasingly view each other as “not just worse for politics” but “downright evil.” The fear of our difference is great enough that some now prefer insurrection at the Capitol over compromise; even the democratic process has become a threat.
Should we be surprised? Framed by both major parties as a battle for the soul of America during the 2020 election, the current state of politics is a zero-sum game — a tribalist struggle for dominance which must conclude with ideological purity, where opposing voices are converted, silenced, or self-selectively isolated into communities of like-minded Americans.
But such an all-or-nothing perspective is untenable in democracy. What we need is to find a way to see the tension of difference not as a threat to be eliminated or avoided, but as a tool for revision and a source of creation. To do so, we must turn to those who have spent their entire lives learning to navigate and grow in the often-shunned space beyond rigid dichotomy.
We must turn to the mixed community.
Like America, I am divided. As a Filipina-American mestiza, my body is a battlefield: colonizer and colonized, immigrant and assimilator, privileged and disenfranchised. It’s a struggle that children of mixed heritage know all too well — the state of being simultaneously not enough of anything and too much of everything, with the awareness that we can always be denied entrance to either side. As Iranian-Japanese designer Nasrin Jafari notes, “Being Mixed often means you’re in-between, and therefore, unseen” — a phenomenon that occurs at Harvard, too, as multiracial students have described feeling lost among affinity groups. In America, mixedness has been outlawed through anti-miscegenation policies, erased through the pressure to choose a side, and cheapened into an “exotic” beauty standard which is often just another form of colorism. But this rejection of the mixed identity only confirms its value.
Mixedness is feared because it is revolutionary: It challenges the very notion of mutual exclusion on which our society is built, proving that the harmful dichotomies we cling to need not be the only way of life.
For those who have always had the luxury of belonging to something, there isn’t much reason to question the philosophy of mutual exclusion. Perilous as tribalism is, some may view it as preferable to the alternative: a world that is blurry and contradictory, steeped in the unpredictable tension of difference. But mixedness is not a danger to society — it is a danger to extremism. Indeed, being mixed confers an ability to bridge seemingly dichotomous spaces and to understand, if not embody, their coexistence. Fleeing towards the polar extremes seems less necessary when we recognize that there is even a middle ground to share.
This holds profound implications for our nation — not only in our capacity for empathy, but also in our pursuit of progress. In her essay “La conciencia de la mestiza,” Chicana theorist Gloria E. Anzaldúa states that mixedness is not “a balancing of opposing powers” but rather that “in attempting to work out a synthesis, the self has added a third element which is greater than the sum of its severed parts.” Strangely — or perhaps not — this sounds exactly like how our government is supposed to function. Democracy should not be a game of ideological domination, as we’re currently witnessing, but rather a synthesis of opposing viewpoints and the use of skeptical analysis in order to create optimal solutions. The future is built by breaking down paradigms, so difference can and must be productive. As impossible as it might seem right now, we’ve known this all along.
Maybe you’re a child of multiple races like me, or you identify with more than one culture or country. Either way, you have it too: this Mixed consciousness, born of the hyphenated space, which finds life rather than destruction in the tension of opposition. Maybe you’ve been made to feel ashamed of your blur and contradictions — but the secret is that you, in all of your multitudes, are exactly what the future needs.
America is divided, yes. But we, the mixed community, are living proof that it can still be whole.

This past year marked the 50th anniversary of the Harvard University Native American Program. This anniversary reminds us of the significant strides HUNAP has made to fulfill the Charter of 1650’s mission — which still governs the University — to support “the education of English and Indian Youth.” Since its founding, HUNAP has promoted an inclusive community and cultivated the academic development and achievement of over one thousand Native alumni.
That said, aspects of Harvard’s colonial past and present, including the University’s early treatment of Indigenous students and the ways in which its affiliates can address enduring colonial tendencies, are not sufficiently discussed on campus.
After participating in a decolonization training led by Alaska Native activists in 2020, I began to reflect on the ways colonialism manifests at Harvard and how white, non-Indigenous students like myself can help promote decolonization respectfully. Following further discussions with Native activists and scholars, I’ve come to believe that Harvard’s student leaders, department heads, and administrators can and must take further steps to better acknowledge Indigenous experiences and help more affiliates engage in decolonization discussions. Becoming a better ally is a lifelong journey involving ongoing learning and reflection. I hope Harvard community members — and you — will join me in it.
Let’s start with some vocabulary: Settler colonialism occurs when one nation subjugates another and politically dominates and exploits its territory for use by settlers, often enforcing its own language and values on the Native people. White supremacy, which still persists today, is the ideology that white people and their ideas, thoughts, beliefs, and actions are superior to people of color and their ideas, thoughts, beliefs, and actions. White supremacist culture is reproduced by many institutions like the media, the education system, western science, and the Christian Church.
Decolonization, on the other hand, is the repatriation of Indigenous land and culture and restoration of Indigenous rights to self-determination. Indigenous educator Nikki Sanchez demonstrates that a crucial first step in this process is those in power foregoing social and economic privileges that directly disempower, appropriate, and invisiblize others.
So, what do these terms mean for Harvard?
Colonialism is inextricable from Harvard’s early history: The Cambridge campus is built on the traditional and ancestral homelands of the Massachusett people. The first European settlers landed on Massachusett shores as early as 1620. During the Great Migration between 1620 and 1640, more than 20,000 white European settlers colonized Massachusett homelands, bringing with them white supremacist views, guns, and infectious diseases, against which the Massachusett had no immunity. Warfare and disease transmission between settlers and Natives reduced the large Massachusett population by as much as 90 percent, leaving them vulnerable to attacks and raids by neighboring nations.
Puritans founded Harvard during the Great Migration with the goal of training clergy. By 1655, the Harvard Indian College was built with the support of the English Society for Propagation of the Gospel in New England, whose mission was to convert Indigenous communities to Christianity. A handful of students enrolled, but only Caleb Cheeshahteaumuck of the Wampanoag tribe graduated. The Indian College, where Matthews Hall now stands, was torn down in 1698 and its bricks were reused to construct new buildings.
Though the bricks of Indian College still remain in Harvard Yard, the University’s early role in perpetuating colonialism is not as widely recognized as it should be.
In “A Brief History of Harvard College'' on Harvard University’s home page, the early founders are proudly highlighted; however, the harmful colonial context of Harvard’s creation is not discussed. Land acknowledgments are notably absent from most Harvard student group and academic websites. While freshmen during orientation week do participate in discussions on identity and inclusivity, in my experience, they do not learn about Harvard’s colonial history.
Colonial culture is also systematically embedded into the academic and social dimensions of Harvard. Campus buildings and streets are named after colonial-era Harvard presidents and slave owners such as Edward Holyoke, Benjamin Wadsworth, and Increase Mather, even though steps have been taken to begin the process of possibly renaming campus spaces. Some of Harvard’s land investments in Brazil have violated the human rights of Indigenous communities by denying them access to natural resources like land and water.
These examples are but a few of the many manifestations of settler colonialism on Harvard’s campus.
The plea to expand awareness of this legacy is not meant to undermine the many fruitful discussions and tangible actions which have taken place. To name one example, Harvard outdoor organizations are beginning to acknowledge the complex history of the land they hike and camp on. The Peabody Museum recently apologized for initially refusing to voluntarily return certain funerary objects to Native American tribes and has committed to changing its current research protocols governing the treatment of human remains and funeral objects.
Despite these steps, a systematic evaluation of Harvard’s past and present is necessary. Requiring land acknowledgments, which show respect for the people whose unceded land Harvard has occupied for nearly 400 years, and creating a mandatory decolonization curriculum for students could be the next step. Training can raise awareness about this legacy and help build upon ongoing conversations.
While we can't change the past, it is our responsibility to strive towards a future where institutional outcomes match modern-day values of inclusivity, equality, and justice. We can work towards this future by listening to Indigenous students and faculty and engage in empathetic discussion about how we can collectively reflect and move forward.

During normal semesters at Harvard, the dining hall serves as a beacon of on-campus life, with students enjoying it as an almost completely standardized and communal eating experience. With few exceptions, we all have an unlimited meal plan, we can access the same food, and — aside from the limited number of students with access to public or in-suite kitchens — we can all go the entire semester without washing a single dish.
But this year has seen a complete upheaval of the typical Harvard College dining experience: Some of us have been cooking for ourselves off campus, learning to buy groceries, experiment with stovetops, and wash dishes like real adults. Others have been eating at home with our families each night. Meanwhile, those of us on campus are still enjoying Harvard University Dining Service meals, but sans the social aspect of gathering in the dining halls.
Inevitably, HUDS looks far different during these pandemic-era semesters. The typical vibrancy of mealtime bonding, chatter, and respite (many of us eat at our desks) has been lost. And yet, amidst uncertain times, one thing has remained constant: the time-tested presence of HUDS workers, who have continued to gift students all their warmth and energy. Indeed, for many of us on campus, HUDS workers have been the only adults regularly present in our lives. And on some days — in light of colder weather and virus restrictions — they are the only people we interact with at all.
The importance of such constancy cannot be overstated, and we want to sincerely thank the incredible team at HUDS for reliably infusing our lives with love and care during tumultuous, lonely times — especially as they have personally risked and endured so much throughout the pandemic.
During ordinary semesters, HUDS frees us from the extra thought and worry that comes with constantly strategizing and preparing food. To that end, during the pandemic — as we’ve instead worked to prepare meals for ourselves amidst the rancor of classes and young adulthood — we have become ever more aware of the immense privilege it is to have access to such wonderful and reliable dining services on campus. But beyond that, having a dependable HUDS meal plan also diminished the pressure of budgeting and paying for take-out. It’s a powerful equalizer. Students that are heirs to fortunes (there are some in here!) and those that come to Harvard homeless all share the same meal plan. Sure, students venture outside of it and might elect to grab food in the Square. Still, this powerful baseline means everyone has a seat at the de facto table, while offering a particularly powerful hand to those of us on financial aid.
During the pandemic, we’ve missed HUDS’s signature blend of convenience, comfort, and care. Even more so, we all miss the splendid energy that has always managed to pervade the dining halls themselves — from the warmth of the dining staff who made each big hall feel like home, to the familiarity of the tables where we made our closest friends. It’s too easy to take such small things for granted amidst the hustle and bustle of campus life. But when we all return to campus, we can’t forget how much we’ve missed these sacred spaces, made complete by the community of students and staff who connect in them.
On many levels, life on campus during Covid-19 has made concrete an understanding of what has been lost. It’s hard to walk the halls and not see before and after. On the other hand, it has magnified and grounded our appreciation of the small things that remain. The smile and brief, warm check-in you get from HUDS workers as you pick up your bagged lunch. The physical spaces holding the fort down until we all return.
We can’t wait for the day when our dining halls are filled with laughter and life once again — when we recoup what has been lost and reactivate all we now know to miss. Upon our return, let’s have endlessly long conversations — ones that are way longer than what we think we have time for — in our cozy dining halls. Let’s savor every bite of our HUDS meals (maybe even try seasoning them yourself!) and relish the wondrous constancy embedded within each of them. And, for once, let’s (actually) grab a meal sometime.

Joy Harjo, the 23rd U.S. poet laureate and a member of the Mvskoke Nation, discussed Native American identity through poetry during a Monday webinar co-hosted by the Harvard University Native American Program and the Harvard Art Museums.
At the event, titled “Native Americans and the National Consciousness” and moderated by Harvard Professor of History Philip J. Deloria, Harjo interspersed her personal experiences as a Native woman with excerpts of her own work and poems from other Native Americans.
Though she read poetry growing up, Harjo said she only started creating her own works after she became involved with activism through the Native students club as an undergraduate at the University of New Mexico.
“I loved Emily Dickinson, I grew up asking for poetry books and reading, but there was always a disconnect between who the poets were and where they came from versus being a young Native person,” Harjo said. “Where were our poets?”
Harjo read a poem from novelist, poet, and writer N. Scott Momaday, a member of the Kiowa tribe and an inspiration of Harjo’s.
“Both Momaday and I have a love of those traditional rituals that place the speaker, singer into an intimate relationship with a place on Earth,” Harjo said. “I believe every poem is a ritual.”
The Poet Laureate also read from a Norton Anthology of native poetry she edited entitled, "When the Light of the World Was Subdued, Our Songs Came Through." The compilation features works from centuries of indigenous poets, including a poem she read by Eleazar, an Indigenous student who entered Harvard in the 1675 before passing away from smallpox prior to graduating.
“The book is constructed again around Earth and place,” Harjo said of the anthology. “There is no American poetry without Indigenous poets, without the roots of Indigenous poetry.”
Harjo’s said one theme in her upcoming memoir, "Poet Warrior," is the parallel between poetry and maps. She said just as maps can tell someone how to get from “where to where,” poetry can impart guidance and instruction.
“Ultimately, I would love to make a map of the soul and I think that the only way to make a map of the soul would be with poetry,” Harjo said.
Harjo, whose other talents include singing and playing the saxophone, also explored the connection between music and poetry. She said her love of sound was one of the factors that drew her to poetry.
University of Oregon History professor Jeffrey Ostler, who attended the event, wrote in an email that one of the “few good things” about the pandemic was that it allowed him to virtually attend an event with “one of America's greatest poets.”
“Medicine for the mind and soul in a troubled time of hope,” he wrote of the event.

President of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation John G. Palfrey ’94 spoke to Harvard Law School students about the intersections of technology and the public interest — a topic he said is increasingly relevant as a result of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic — on Monday.
The lecture also featured three first-year law students who took “Technology and the Public Interest,” a course Palfrey taught earlier this academic year as the Law School’s Steven and Maureen Klinsky Visiting Professor of Practice for Leadership and Progress.
Palfrey explained that he and the students enrolled in his course, whom he described as “an intrepid group,” shifted their focus after the storming of the Capitol on Jan. 6.
“Smack in the middle of our class, a group of largely white people took up arms against our country’s congressional leadership,” Palfrey said. “While this insurrection mattered to everyone, it has special meaning in the context of our course.”
Palfrey said he and his students adjusted their class discussions to focus on the insurrection and discuss its technological and public-interest implications.
“We threw out the carefully planned syllabus for a few days to talk about what the introduction meant to us as people devoted to the study and the practice of law and as human beings,” he said. “These terrifying events unfolding in front of us held out the chance to talk about race, power, injustice and social class among many other things.”
Now was the time, Palfrey argued, to construct new technological systems designed with the public interest in mind and created with the help of “dynamic, more diverse” groups of young people.
“It is time in my view for us to reimagine the knowledge and information needs in a democracy before it is too late,” he said. “We should imagine and build new digital infrastructure for the public good — this is the progress and leadership I’d love to see in our field.”
Following Palfrey’s lecture, the three students offered their opinions on the intersection of technology and public interest.
Madeleine V. Matsui, a law student taking classes from Hong Kong, said the course offered her the opportunity to consider relevant questions about how best to restructure existing technological systems to assist all digital citizens — not just a select few.
“As we discussed in class, so many crucial questions surrounding technology and innovation are in flux,” Matsui said. “Many of our existing mechanisms and institutions are struggling to respond adequately to ensure that digital technologies benefit everyone.”
Isabella J. Berkley addressed the University’s approach to online learning. Though Harvard attempted to “equalize the playing field” by offering a technology grant to students, she said there are other, more “creative” steps the University can take to support its students during a pandemic.
“Some might need more ongoing support or a larger initial input of financial capital,” Berkley said. “Thinking creatively here would also include grants for other resources offered on campus that might not be available virtually, such as a health and wellness grant.”
Jess I. Valenzuela Ramirez added that certain students’ struggles to adjust to remote learning is emblematic of systemic issues of inequality that transcend Harvard.
“We see that all of these challenges are compounded by other issues that already plagued higher education,” Valenzuela Ramirez said.
University Professor Martha L. Minow concluded the event by commending Palfrey for adjusting his course to accommodate events unfolding beyond the ivory tower.
“We have to be resilient and we have to be nimble as the modification of your well-planned course after January 6 indicates,” she said. “That is itself an inspiring act — the way you and the class responded quickly and immediately to deal with the real world.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To support Harvard Medical School students’ efforts to provide medical resources and knowledge to the greater public, Harvard Medical School will launch an office for “community-centered medical education” in fall 2021.
Spurred by longstanding calls among students for a closer relationship between the Medical School and the Greater Boston area, the office will aim to provide centralized resources and mentorship to medical students interested in pursuing public service.
“Our students have been advocating for this since I was a student,” said Nancy E. Oriol, the HMS dean for Community Engagement in Medical Education, who also graduated from HMS in 1979 and served as the HMS Dean for Students from 1997 to 2016.
Despite many efforts to engage with the Greater Boston area, Oriol said students and faculty have “been doing it on their own in a silo.”
“I remember being completely scattered in terms of groups all kind of working on the same thing but not really talking with each other,” HMS Student Council President Tyler S. LeComer ’19 said.
As a result, during his first few months of medical school this past fall, LeComer conducted outreach to student organizations and helped create a space for groups to collaborate and coordinate their efforts.
David B. Duong, the Medical School’s director of the Program in Global Primary Care and Social Change, also said student organizations have struggled to sustain their efforts due to a lack of “continuity” as students come and go.
“Especially as students are constantly in transition — cohorts of students are going into their clinical years, exiting their clinical years and exiting Harvard and graduating, new students are coming in,” he said.
“So how do we maintain that momentum despite all these transitions?” Duong asked.
Duong said he hopes this office will “provide an administrative infrastructure” to maintain the Medical School’s “longitudinal engagements with the community.”
To further develop the office’s goals and priorities, the Medical School will create a steering committee that will meet this spring composed of representatives of the greater public and the Medical School’s student body, faculty, and administration.
According to Duong, the office’s development was “rooted in co-creation.”
To solicit input from all affected constituencies — students, faculty, and individuals outside of Harvard — leaders of the initiative have held town halls and surveyed different groups about their needs.
First-year medical student William Z. Li, who will serve on the steering committee, said he sent a survey to current medical and dental students. According to Li, roughly 45 percent of respondents disagreed or strongly disagreed with the statement, “I had access to adequate tools and support to engage in meaningful career-related work during medical or dental school.”
Li also said a majority of survey respondents indicated interest in seeing more patient clinics and rotations incorporating local health organizations, a bulletin of community organizations accepting student volunteers, and more community-based research and service opportunities.
LeComer said the office will serve an important role through promoting interaction between the Medical School and individuals outside of the “ivory tower.”
He added that he hopes the office will ensure that future physicians not only see well-resourced patients at “high end hospitals,” but that they also engage with other members of the local population.
“It doesn't make sense to me to utilize the space without really caring about the community directly around you,” he said.
HMS Student Council Vice President of Advocacy Arushi Saini, who will also have a seat on the steering committee, said she believes the new office will promote the value of service projects within the Medical School.
“Community-centered work isn’t seen as validly as say clinical research is,” Saini said. “Having this office changed the conversation around what community advocacy and community-centric work is, and legitimatizes that this is equally valuable as other forms of research or passions that students have pursued.”
Oriol said she believes promoting local outreach in medical education encourages both personal and professional growth among students.
“We are training the next generation of physicians,” Oriol said. “When you work with people, when you learn from people, it expands your horizons in your understanding of human nature, of people’s lives, and it makes you a better physician.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Harvard Astronomy professor and Adams House Master William Liller ’48 couldn’t take his eyes off the stars.
In the early 1970s, Liller could be found early in the morning at Harvard College Observatory measuring the sizes of stars, putting in “more than his share of the work” each day to aid his graduate students, according to William R. Forman, one of Liller’s Ph.D. advisees.
“You would get there at 10 … and there would be this long list of plates that he’d already been through,” Forman said. “He was not there yelling at us, ‘You got to do more.’ No, he was just showing us that he was doing it, and we better get to work.”
Liller died Feb. 28 at 93 of a brief illness, according to his son, John A. Liller ’83.
William Liller was born in 1927 in Philadelphia, Pa. His undergraduate career at Harvard was altered by the effects of World War II. During registration, rationing cards were collected to be used in dining halls, Liller wrote in Adams House’s alumni magazine, "The Gold Coaster," in its spring 2011 issue.
He joined the Astronomy Department, which at the time was “very much depleted by the war effort, was missing several of [its] best known professors,” he wrote. Liller was drafted as a Navy radio technician in July 1945, which halted his undergraduate career for almost a year.
Liller graduated from the College in 1949 with a degree in Astronomy. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Michigan on the topic of planetary nebulae in 1953, and remained there as an associate professor until 1960.
With the offer of a full professorship and the chairmanship of Harvard’s Astronomy department, Liller returned to Cambridge in 1960. He chaired the department from 1960 to 1964 and from 1965 to 1966.
In 1959, Liller and other astronomy professors began working on a project for NASA to create and launch a satellite that would monitor the sun; he continued the project at Harvard. A failure came in 1964 when a fire started in the rocket that destroyed it.
Aside from his own academic work, Liller served as an advisor to seven Astronomy Ph.D. students, most of whom became distinguished scholars in the field.
Christine Jones ’71, one of his advisees in the early 1970s, performed astronomical research and observations alongside Liller. Together, they co-wrote several papers on unfolding research in x-ray astronomy.
Jones — now a senior astrophysicist at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory — remembered that during one research trip to Chile, Liller welcomed the former president of Chile at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory. Liller decided to give the guest a tour of the southern sky, directing the view of the telescope so the president could see all that was the best to see.
Bruce W. Carney, physics and astronomy professor emeritus and former provost of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, recalled Liller as an “easy-going” and helpful advisor during his Ph.D. years.
Carney, who visited Liller post-graduation when conducting research in Chile, recollected that his former advisor was “well-respected” by colleagues and peers. Carney added that Liller helped connect him with luminaries in the field when those academics came to Cambridge.
“When people asked who my advisor was, and I said, ‘Bill Liller,’ they were pleased, they smiled,” Carney said.
Even with all the work he put in for his advisees, Liller always wanted to assure the credit went to the students.
“He was never willing to be the first author of the paper,” Forman said. “He always thought that was the appropriate role of the student, even when he did a lot of the work.”
Forman, who is married to Jones, credits Liller with helping to launch both his and his wife’s careers.
Despite Liller’s stature in the field, he was “down to earth” and “very approachable,” Forman added. Forman attributed this partly to Liller’s role as a House Master — a position now called Faculty Dean — of Adams House for several years, during which listening to the concerns of students was a top priority.
An Adams House resident during his own undergraduate years, Liller quickly re-entered the House’s community when he returned to Cambridge, first serving as a non-resident tutor and then a House associate.
When offered the House Master position in 1968, Liller accepted and he and his family moved into Adams’s Apthorp House. Liller was the first person ever to be Master of their own undergraduate House.
As Adams House Master, Liller oversaw the first co-ed residence in the University’s history. Liller corresponded with Law School professor Richard Baxter, then the Master of Radcliffe College’s all-female South House, about the possibility of a co-ed experiment.
The two sent a proposal to then-University President Nathan M. Pusey, Sr., for 25 female students from South House — now Cabot House — to swap places with 25 male residents of Adams House. After an advisory committee convened by Pusey voted in overwhelming favor of integrated housing, the swap was made in February 1970.
Jones, who was a Radcliffe student at the time, decided not to opt into the program because Radcliffe dorms were conveniently close to Harvard College Observatory, which she frequented as an undergraduate.
Still, she said the program was “a very good change.” Academically, in some of her upper-level physics classes, she was one of few women and found it hard to join a study group with most of her classmates living in male-only dorms.
“Other members were doing homework together in groups. I wasn’t doing that because I didn’t have people from my dorm who were in those classes,” she said. “It was just too hard to become a part of a study group that was only young men meeting in their dorms.”
In the 2011 Gold Coaster article, Liller expressed satisfaction with the co-ed experiment, asserting that the historic swap had enhanced the living experience.
“That Adams House was now a better place, there can be no doubt,” he wrote. “It seemed that everywhere, from the dining room to the common rooms, from the library to the Friday afternoon teas, the general ambiance, overall spirit and civil manners were improved.”
Nancy Stieber ’71, one of the 25 South House residents who moved to Adams House in 1970, said the move felt like a delayed integration into authentic Harvard life, emphasizing that Radcliffe felt isolated from campus activities.
“Quite frankly, we felt exiled — all the women clustered up at Radcliffe, the long march across the Commons to classes,” she said. “It felt as if finally, I was where the action was. Moving into Adams House was finally, finally being at Harvard.”
Stieber said that the “semi-permeable” nature of Adams House’s suites — with back doors, windows, and balconies — enhanced students’ ability to connect and spend time with one another.
“It was moving into a rather magical environment,” she said.
After launching this historic change, Liller relinquished his position as Master in 1973 — deciding to instead dedicate more time to his astronomy research.
In 1981, Liller decided to leave Harvard for good to become the associate director of an astronomy center called Instituto Isaac Newton in Chile. “Professionally, I really needed a change,” Liller wrote in the Gold Coaster.
In 1986, NASA offered Liller the chance to observe Halley’s Comet on Easter Island. He became a member of the Easter Island Foundation and served as a Director Emeritus of the foundation at the time of his death.
With nearly five dozen night-sky discoveries to his credit, including two minor planets, one comet, and more than four dozen novae, Liller wrote that that at age 84, his fascination with discovery was undulled. He continued to use his “little NASA-supplied telescope” in the backyard of his home in Chile “to look for comets, novas and other things that pop up unannounced in the night.”
“After all, for my entire life I had been enamored with the cosmos,” Liller wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Massachusetts House is considering a bill that would make the previously optional payments which supplanted city property taxes for nonprofits such as Harvard mandatory.
The proposal affects nonprofits with total property valued at over $15 million and would require them to pay 25 percent of the property taxes they would owe as a commercial entity, pending approval at the local level.
The bill, H.D. 3207, mirrors Boston’s optional Payment in Lieu of Taxes program, which comes as part of a broader movement to reform PILOT and similar programs as payments by institutions regularly fall short of their requested totals. Harvard, for example, has failed to meet requests for the past nine consecutive years, contributing only 79 percent of Boston's $13 million ask in 2020.
State Rep. Erika Uyterhoeven submitted the bill and has currently accumulated five co-sponsors, including Rep. Michael L. Connolly and Sen. Patricia D. Jehlen, both of whom represent portions of Cambridge.
Uyterhoeven said the bill is intended to ensure that “large endowment” institutions such as Harvard are legally bound to pay their “fair share” in a way that they are not currently under PILOT.
“Unfortunately, Harvard has failed to pay their obligations, and this bill is attempting to address that problem,” Uyterhoeven said. “This is an attempt to say, 'Look, let's just then make it law, rather than having these agreements between municipalities and various nonprofit institutions.'”
She added it was critical for these payments to be made now, with an affordable housing crisis facing Boston — a crisis she said cannot be solved by just raising taxes on residents.
“The burden has been, particularly in Boston, increasing on residents who are struggling to stay in their homes, particularly through this Covid pandemic,” Uyterhoeven said. “We really want to encourage institutions to step up and take seriously, right, what does it mean to be part of our community and part of supporting our community and its residents?”
In addition to payments on property valued at roughly $1.5 billion in Boston, Harvard also makes PILOT payments to the city of Cambridge — payments which Councilor Jivan G. Sobrinho-Wheeler wrote in an email must go further to address poverty in the city.
"Harvard benefits from the welcoming and diverse community that is Cambridge in so many ways – from our parks to our roads and infrastructure to our community services,” Sobrinho-Wheeler wrote. “With its $40 billion endowment, the university needs to be contributing to the City for the sake of its own community members and to help advance equity for all our residents."
University spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke pushed back on claims that Harvard is not contributing enough to the cities of Boston and Cambridge. She wrote in an email that Harvard benefits the city through both PILOT payments and municipal taxes on non-exempt property, as well as providing “programs, initiatives and outreach” to local residents.
“These local benefits are an important extension of Harvard’s mission, serve thousands of local residents every year, and reflect years of collaboration between the University, its neighbors, and city partners,” O’Rourke added.
Boston’s PILOT program allows participants to contribute 50 percent of requested payments in the form of “community benefits.” Though Harvard’s benefits under this provision were valued at $6.5 million in 2020, the University still fell short of its requested total cash contribution. The House bill would leave this provision intact, allowing municipalities to determine the criteria for these benefits.
Sobrinho-Wheeler said that such benefits needed to be more strictly defined for PILOT to properly meet the needs of Cambridge’s citizens.
“The definition of community benefits, which universities can offer in lieu of a financial contribution, is too nebulous,” he wrote. “There has been a lot of work on PILOTs in Boston in the past decade that I think Cambridge can learn from and go beyond.”
“We have two of the wealthiest universities in the world in Cambridge alongside residents experiencing poverty and joblessness in our city – Cambridge should be the leader on this issue that other cities turn to,” he added.

We’ve all been there before: meticulously editing our LinkedIn pages, trying to figure out which perfectly crafted bio will finally catch the eye of that recruiter you think might stalk your page sometime soon, immediately hitting you up with multiple offers. Whether you’re the person that reads everyone’s LinkedIn updates (who needs Instagram, amiright?) or forgets to accept your ever-increasing number of connection requests, here’s a field guide to the different kinds of people you’ll meet on LinkedIn as you get on your #networking #grind.
The Mystery Connector
You’ve probably never met this person before. Whether it’s because you have zero mutual connections or they attend an obscure university somewhere across the globe, you’re not really sure how this person found you, and they know that’s what you’re thinking. Sometimes they’ll just shoot their shot and hit the “connect” button, but more often, they’ll write a mini-essay about why they want to connect. Your profile looked interesting? You happen to go to one of the most well-known universities on the planet? They would like to work with you? Everything goes!
The Influencer
This is the person who will immediately post about how lucky they are to accept their summer internship offer the day after it pulls up in their mailbox. They are also more likely to do this in February (???), leaving you stress eating microwave popcorn on your common room couch at 2 a.m. worrying about your own plans (this may or may not be speaking from personal experience). Throughout the rest of the year, they’ll post about the random positions they get, so expect lots of updates from them about participating in another Institute of Politics program, becoming an analyst at yet another finance club, or being first in line at the dhall. Either way, though, we’re happy for you! Keep achieving, but... maybe be a bit more chill on LinkedIn.
The “Can I add you on LinkedIn?”
We’ve all been there before. Whether it was the moment you first opened an account or a mad dash to 500+ connections, you’ve probably mindlessly hit that connect button more than once. Some people just keep going with it. Whether they saw you send a message to your class GroupMe once or read your name from their computer in a hundred person class, they’ll take anything as an excuse to add you on LikedIn. No need to ask verbally, either, since LinkedIn will do all the asking for them with their constant emails and notifications.
The Lurker
This might be that one guy you think you met at Opening Days, but you can’t be too sure. Why? Well, this account has no profile picture. Instead of a last name, they only have their initial. Usually, they’ll have Harvard listed on their profile (since that’s the most important thing before you get that Goldman internship) and nothing else. Bonus points if LinkedIn is their only social media and they take months to respond to your connection request.
The Celebrity
You’re not really sure why these accounts exist on LinkedIn. Did you seriously believe Justin Trudeau was going to offer you a job, let alone notice your profile? For a social media platform that exists to aid in networking, it’s a bit odd to see random celebrities, politicians, and miscellaneous rich people post the same life updates that they do on Facebook. How did they get their special celebrity profiles? When will I be able to reach that level? Only time will tell.
No matter how you choose to use your LinkedIn, here’s hoping that you enjoy it! Don’t forget to connect with @flybyblog for the juiciest networking opportunities (Author’s note: lol jk — unless interviewing Claire J. Saffitz ’09 is the opportunity you seek 😉)! Have fun stalking everyone from your section on LinkedIn.
