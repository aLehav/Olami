After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When we think of great art, we often think of striking objects and dazzling performances. These pieces, however, never exist on their own—they are framed by the context of the spaces they occupy. “The Room Where It Happens: On the Agency of Interior Spaces,” a symposium held at the Harvard Art Museums as part of Boston’s HubWeek, sought to examine the ways space reflects and even influences both art and the viewer. Featuring 11 speakers, the presentation explored the power of the interior to foment new ideas.
The relationship between human agent and interior was impressively bookended by the symposium’s keynote speakers. The event opened on Friday evening with a lecture by Louis P. Nelson, a professor of architectural history at the University of Virginia. In his talk “Making Room: Cartography, Collecting, and the Construction of Empire,” Nelson argued that the empires of the world were built and validated not only by territorial acquisition, but also by a more abstract conception of authority facilitated by art collection. The deliberate formulation of spaces to house these artifacts served a larger purpose of cementing the idea of empire. Mark Dion, an artist who delivered the closing note of the symposium, makes art which probes the relationship between the observable world we live in and the ideological realms people create. Together, the two invited discussion on how we humans carve out interiors for our own purposes.
The event showcased the versatility of the room. Split into three separate panels: “Rooms for Looking,” “Rooms for Making,” and “Virtual Rooms,” and including locations as diverse as parlors, laboratories, and cockpits, the talk vastly expanded standard ideas of what an indoor space can be. It’s clear that not all spaces are created equal: They are built with specific purposes in mind, giving rise to features which fit the needs of their inhabitants.
Of particular interest was the final panel, which argued that spaces need not be concrete in any conventional sense. One example given by Sarah A. Carter, curator at the Chipstone Foundation, was “Mrs. M.–––––’s Cabinet”, a fictional period room used as an experimental space for students. Centered on an enigmatic, fictional private collector, the room is a constantly-evolving display of objects which challenges us to evaluate how history can be represented. Chad Randl, a lecturer in architecture from Cornell University, took a turn for the whimsical. Looking critically at flight simulators built in homes, he considered the relationship between leisure and the domestic sphere and worked to understand the role of play in belonging to and escaping from the realities of home life. A space need not be tangible or permanent to have an impact on those it interacts with.
For all the interesting insights provided in the presentation, the symposium never neglected the realities of the larger space—the Harvard Art Museums—in which it took place. After each discussion, there was ample time for audience members to pose questions to the panelists. There was also space in between panels to sample the interior of the museum and put its teachings to work. Coupled with a new exhibition, “The Philosophy Chamber: Art and Science in Harvard’s Teaching Cabinet 1766-1820,” the event provided immediate opportunities to apply its lectures to a unique space on campus.
A thought-provoking set of panels, “The Room Where It Happens” was a wonderful addition to HubWeek. The talk asserted that how we create spaces in which to live, observe, and interact tells us a lot about ourselves. Interior spaces can reveal who we as people are on the inside.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fact: There is no half-decent place to have a panic attack at Harvard.
During Opening Days, this was one of the first things to occur to me. Everywhere I turned, there they were: people. I had a roommate. I shared a bathroom with seven other students. I ate every meal at Annenberg Hall. I was constantly surrounded by people I knew.
The first time I went into a music practice room and found silence for the first time in weeks, it occurred to me to stop by the Music Department next time I knew it would be a rough night. I began cataloguing places where no one would engage with me: the corner of Tercentenary Theatre, the east side of Widener library, the upper levels of Lamont. Quiet, solitary areas were few and far between. Even if I found a moment to myself, it was only a matter of time before it was replaced by the constant stream of activity that defines this campus.
I’ve dealt with an anxiety disorder since the beginning of high school. While I’m not currently taking medication, my anxiety is something that impacts my life every day. When I’m out with friends, when I’m sitting in class, when I’m writing an essay, the question is always there: What do I do if things get bad?
There’s an expectation that if someone looks upset, you help them. That ideal, though well-intentioned, is also often misguided. Most people cannot tell the difference between someone who is crying for personal reasons and someone who is having an anxiety attack. People think that their “being there” is inherently helpful. And, for some, it might be.
For me, however, it is not. If I’m breaking down, I don’t expect someone else to put the pieces back together. Over the past few years, I’ve become quite good at doing that myself. I don’t need someone to sit with me, or stroke my back, or tell me that things are going to be okay. Instead, more than anything, I need to be left alone.
Yet, I can’t say these things when I’m in the middle of having an anxiety attack. Dealing with my own situation requires all of my energy; I don’t have any to spend on another person. After all, it’s hard to speak when you’re hyperventilating.
And then, here’s the thing: When you tell someone you’re fine, and you’re in the middle of having an anxiety attack, they don’t tend to believe you. Which is more than understandable, seeing as you’re crying, shaking, breathing heavily, and exhibiting other tell-tale signs of “not-fine-ness.”
This is why those two words—“I’m fine”—require a bit of translation. Because “I’m fine” does not mean that I’m fine. It means that you can’t help me.
In fact, the only thing that will truly help me is the one thing that is not accessible: a private, secluded place to take a moment, regain my footing, and return to business as usual.
To its credit, Harvard does have a wide variety of resources available for people with anxiety disorders and other mental health-related concerns. In fact, I lose count of the peer counseling groups that I see advertised on bulletin boards across campus. However, counseling is, by nature, discussion-based.
For some, discussion may be productive. Yet, I don’t want to talk to someone about my situation; I want to do the opposite. While a designated quiet space might help me, Harvard does not currently provide this resource. In this, while Harvard’s services are helpful to some, they don’t fit my needs. I don’t need help or guidance. I simply need privacy.
My anxiety disorder is no one’s business but my own. So much so, in fact, that I’ve become quite good at hiding it. The fact that I have anxiety is often one of the last things that people learn about me. This isn’t because I’m ashamed, in denial, or avoiding the issue. It is simply because it is private.
So, when I say “I’m fine,” understand that I am dealing with something that does not concern you. Understand that, though I may not truly be “fine” at the moment, I eventually will be. And understand that the best thing that you can do for me is believe me.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following a tumultuous year in the Athletics Department, initiated by shocking revelations about the culture of the men’s soccer team last fall, Harvard has implemented five mandatory training programs on topics ranging from gender and sexual harassment to unconscious bias. We commend the Athletics Department for taking substantive steps to reform team cultures and increase transparency. However, we hope that these reforms are only the starting point in what will be a sustained effort.
The Athletics Department should take additional steps to ensure that student voices are heard and that student athletes feel at home while competing for Harvard. Moreover, administrators must also be conscious of the various ways these trainings can be formatted so as to ensure that athletes take them seriously. In particular, facilitators of the trainings should try to balance the respective benefits of creating dialogue within teams and between teams and the larger student body.
Compelling all teams to undergo training on diversity and sexual harassment begins a conversation, but preventing “locker room talk” will require a broader cultural shift than five sessions a year. True change comes when students actively work to improve their teams, and we urge student athletes to be peer leaders in calling out inappropriate language and behavior when they witness it.
In line with this approach, we also encourage the Athletics Department to be responsive to student concerns and feedback. Student athletes should be able to rely on the department when voicing concerns about toxic team cultures or even their own coaches. It is essential that the department be not only reactive to headline-catching scandals, but also proactive, actively seeking out feedback on how it can continue to improve in the near future.
As the Athletics Department continues to hire new coaches and administrators, it should evaluate candidates not only in terms of their track record in athletic management, but also on the basis of their commitment to issues of diversity and harassment. New coaches should have specific proposals for how to protect their athletes and foster healthy team cultures that enable team members to balance athletics with the rest of their lives at Harvard.
With cases such as the men’s soccer team, it is clear that toxic cultures of masculinity have made other athletes feel unsafe. Therefore, we also encourage the Athletic Department to be mindful of the gender gap in coaching. In response, the department ought to make recruiting more female coaches to campus a priority.
We hope that these new trainings are an indication that more steps will be taken to improve the department. While winning on the field is perhaps more exciting than institutional reforms, a truly successful athletics program is one that takes care of all its players.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
He slid his hand onto her thigh and her heart, startled, jumped into its heartstrings, noosed itself in her throat, closing it up tight. She could not speak, she could not breathe, but she knew if she moved another inch, something would go wrong. Someone would notice and she would be told she’s overreacting, or she’ll cause a scene that will make her chances at making something out this relationship or networking in this space moot. Or—even worse—no one will notice. No one will see her fury, her anger, her fear muzzled under that grasp, that handle of ownership as if she were nothing more than a piece of furniture, an object. Either way, the moment he put his hands on her, she lost her breath and her words hung trepidatiously, in the balance between the muzzle and her heart.
Did this make you cringe—did it evoke an uncomfortable squirm, a loosening of the tie—how about a swallowing of a gulp of air, in appreciation of the privilege of its clarity? Even worse: Does it sound commonplace, ordinary—like it could have happened here at Harvard?
This example was the awful beginning of a real-life encounter for model Trish Goff, who was assaulted and groped by Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. She and 30 other women (and counting) have recently come forward after a New York Times article broke the news that Weinstein had been paying off his victims to avoid going public with their sexual harassment allegations for decades. Recounts of these incidents are graphic: Survivors report levels of harassment and assault from sexual demands to forced oral sex. This outpouring of sexual assault claims against a man in the media is not uncommon as of late; Bill Cosby and President Donald Trump are among others whose crimes against women have been unveiled in recent years.
Having to suffer through any type of sexual harassment or sexual assault is absolutely unacceptable and unbearable. And yet, most of these women held onto this secret for years—decades even. Sexual assault survivor McKayla Maroney, an Olympic gold medalist, suggests this hesitation comes from a fear of putting one’s “careers and dreams in jeopardy”. Self-blame, inability to provide proof, the feeling of humiliation, and myriad other reasons prevent survivors from sharing their stories.
All of the aforementioned barriers to coming forward with sexual assault can easily be applied to the female community at Harvard. The ambitious environment here that women are taught to “act aggressively in” boils with the danger for these kind of encounters to occur. Given the high propensity for students to want to network with others they see in a position of power for future career moves, there is an all-too-real opportunity for these individuals to take advantage of a situation. This is a product of the overall exclusionary nature of the campus, breeding this need to prove one’s self in these social spaces in an effort to feel as though one belongs. As this need proliferates within these elite and exclusive spheres (a relative facsimile to the elitism and exclusivity of Hollywood), the cycle of sexual assault is perpetuated.
Stemming from the same fears that Maroney spoke to, many survivors of these situations may then hide the truth of this encounter—in part because of the fear of losing a occupational opportunity, and in part because of the cutthroat campus culture that couples an inability to handle being at Harvard with a lack of worthiness to be here. Just 16 percent of women at Harvard, compared to the national 37 percent, feel it is extremely likely the school would take action if the offense was reported. Thus, sexual assault can quickly become hidden, tucked away from the public eye.
Final clubs are an unfortunate case study for this type of interaction to manifest itself, as they are the second most common place for these assaults to occur after dorm rooms. Women at Harvard College who participate in final clubs are 16 percentage points more likely to experience sexual assault relative to the regular Harvard College female senior, according to a sexual climate survey conducted in the spring of 2015. Moreover, there has been a history of unreported sexual assault on this campus, which is inexcusable.
The bravery of the women who came out against Harvey Weinstein must not only be commended, but held as an example to all women that they too can speak out against sexual harassment and assault (if it is in the best interest of their mental health, of course). The recent social media campaign #MeToo has been empowering in this sense, creating a space where women at all ends of the spectrum of sexual harassment can empathize with one another and bring attention to this issue.
Here at Harvard, we can use this as an example for us too, encouraging our survivors to come forward with their stories to show that sexual assault or harassment on our campus has no place here, and that situations like the one described above should never occur again.

UPDATED: October 22, 2017 at 11:20 p.m.
Alexander H. Patel ’18, an Adams House senior whom peers remembered as an intelligent, attentive friend with a passion for teaching, has died in a “heartbreaking” loss, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana wrote in an email to students Sunday.
Middlesex County District Attorney’s Office spokesperson Meghan Kelly wrote in an email Sunday evening that “there is no foul play suspected” in Patel’s death. Khurana wrote in his email that the death was “sudden and unexpected.”
“This is very a painful time for those who knew Alexander, especially his family and friends,” Khurana wrote. “Our thoughts and our prayers are with each of them. I ask that you each offer comfort to those around you who may be suffering during this time and need a shoulder to lean on.”
Patel was a Philosophy and Mathematics concentrator and a former Crimson News editor. He served as a teaching fellow for Computer Science 61: “Systems Programming and Machine Organization” in fall 2015 and for Computer Science 161: “Operating Systems” in spring 2017. According to his Facebook, Patel hailed from Denver, Colorado. He lived off campus.
During his time on The Crimson, Patel covered Harvard Business School and worked on the paper’s data analysis team, winning a national award for his story on faculty political donations. He had worked for the past six months in a laboratory run by Computer Science professor Margo I. Seltzer ’83, who wrote in an email that Patel was “a beloved member of our lab.”
Roughly 50 students and administrators, including Khurana, gathered Sunday evening in the Adams House Lower Common Room to honor Patel’s memory. Some students brought flowers, which attendees arranged in a glass vase in the middle of the room.
Seated around a table bearing the flowers and two lit candles, those present shared stories about Patel for nearly an hour. Sometimes attendees—many of them tearful—remained silent for minutes at a time.
Afterwards, students clustered in small groups and traded memories of Patel.
“More than anything, he was just a sweet guy,” said Hugh G. Strike ’19, who said he was Patel’s freshman year roommate.
“He was always there in every sense. You could tell,” said Brian L. Sapozhnikov ’19, who said he once took a Philosophy class with Patel. “When you were talking to him, he was actually listening.”
Mehdi Aourir ’18 said Patel served as a Teaching Fellow for “a lot” of the classes he has taken at Harvard. He called Patel his “savior” during office hours.
“He was always the person who would help with a smile,” Aourir said. “Savior was the first thing that came to mind. He was extremely smart.”
Alexis J. Ross ’20, too, said she remembers Patel’s skill as a teacher. Even though she never took a class taught by him, Ross said that, almost from the minute she met Patel, he started “passionately telling me everything he knew” and offering to meet and chat further down the road.
Ross, a Crimson editor, said Patel’s warmth and openness were infectious.
“I remember being so grateful to meet someone so welcoming,” Ross said. “It’s heartbreaking that he’s gone, and I’ll really miss him.”

UC Berkeley assistant professor Aila M. Matanock ’05 presented her research Friday on the importance of engaging rebel groups in the post-conflict political process.
Matanock’s research is featured in her new book, "Electing Peace: From Civil Conflict to Political Participation." In the work, she argues that provisions in conflict resolutions that channel rebel groups’ energy into the electoral system increase the chances of achieving long-term peace.
“The evidence in this book...suggests that [this] particular type of post-conflict elections may be particularly helpful” in achieving peace,” said Matanock.”
Matanock’s specific focus on peace deals that brought rebel parties into the electoral process led her to a far different conclusion than other researchers.
Past research has suggested that post-conflict elections involving rebel groups “don’t increase the probability or durability of peace, and some even show that particular elections can reduce the chances that you’ll have a stable settlement,” Matanock said. But this research has largely focused on what Matanock called “hastily-run” elections in Afghanistan and Iraq where rebel groups refused to participate.
Matanock also spoke about a forthcoming paper she co-authored that examines the extent to which ordinary citizens’ support for these agreements, typically negotiated by elites, depend on their personal involvement with the conflict.
Referendums only occur in about 10 percent of settlements, noted Matanock, despite broad support for direct civilian input.  And even when the public is engaged in the process, their opinions are often overridden, Matanock noted, like when the Colombian Congress agreed to a peace deal on its own last year after citizens voted to reject a similar deal in a referendum.
Matanock’s article closely examined the Colombian Conflict, which began in mid-1960s. The conflict killed over 220,000 people, uprooted more than 6 million, and left some 8 million registered victims, according to the United States Institute of Peace.
Matanock and her colleagues interviewed voters in 59 municipalities around Colombia to gauge support for the peace deal. Their research, conducted in early 2015 prior to the referendum took place found broad support overall for a peace deal, but much more ambivalence toward individual clauses of the deal, specifically concessions to FARC that would have allowed the group to participate in the electoral process.
One particularly noteworthy aspect of the survey results was the finding that victims of the conflict were actually more likely to support peace, even if that meant allowing members of FARC into the government.
Matanock asserted that FARC has seen a slow decline in its recruitment numbers since the organization began participating in the cocaine trade in the 1980s.
Matanock said that after former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe came out against the proposed peace deal because of the absence of substantive punishment for FARC members, public support for a peace agreement fell.

Two courses in the History department this semester are taking advantage of modern technology to better understand the past.
Gabriel Pizzorno—a preceptor in the History Department who teaches “History 1993: Introduction to Digital History” and supervises the Digital Fellows Program—sees digital history as a way to process information faster and to discover patterns or trends which previously would not be apparent.
Pizzorno’s course introduces students to the basics of digital histories, methods for studying digital history, and its future applications.
 Anne Ruderman—who also teaches a course which integrates elements of digital history, “History 1050: Slavery and the Slave Trade in the Atlantic World”—described a central component of digital history as being able to understand where computers might be more useful in conducting research compared to traditional methods used to study history.
“It’s essential to develop and explore the dialogue between analogue and digital tools,” Ruderman said.
Pizzorno’s course teaches students how to find relevant data and refine that information for the project they are completing. Students enrolled in Pizzorno’s course experiment with different ways to present information in a digital format.
“I take what we understand to be the research workflow and combine it with a data processing workflow,” said Pizzorno.
Ruderman’s course takes a slightly different approach, teaching the methods of digital history by incorporating the methods into the material.
Ruderman has included teaching the tools of digital history into the course by replacing four lectures on the material of the course with tutorials on how to use certain technologies for research purposes.
“I decided that if I wanted to have these digital elements as a core component of the class, I needed to teach the students how to use them as part of the class, not as some additional seminar they had to attend one Friday at 5 p.m.,” Ruderman said.
Ruderman has replaced midterms and papers with more untraditional assignments which cause the students to use digital tools to think about the best way to present the material. Instead of a final paper, students will produce their own podcast delving into a topic of their choosing.
Ruderman believes that the emergence and growth of the material available on the Internet has fundamentally altered the way individuals will perform historical research, allowing for the rapid acquisition of historical data.
“It’s really not a fashion or a fad. I really think of it as a paradigm shift,” Ruderman said.
Pizzorno does not see digital history as a subsection of the study of History, but rather as something that will soon be a fundamental aspect of  the discipline.
“Soon people won’t even identify digital history as something different, because it will be so ingrained as part of the way people study history,” Pizzorno said.

Chinese billionaire Wang Shi visited Harvard over the weekend, delivering a sold-out lecture in Mandarin Chinese about his experiences in business and academia.
More than 250 people turned out to Science Center Hall D for Saturday’s talk, which was organized by the Harvard East Asian Urban Forum of the Graduate School of Design. Wang is the founder of China Vanke, which is the largest real estate firm in China and was founded in 1984.
After announcing his resignation from Vanke’s chairmanship in June, Wang has been pursuing a growing interest in environmental issues and using his clout to spread environmental awareness within Chinese industry. Since stepping down, Wang has been invited to speak about his life at multiple venues in the United States, including Harvard.
 Qingnan Xie, a visiting fellow at the Law School, said in Chinese that she has long been familiar with Wang as “one of the Chinese business celebrities” and came to the event because of her interest in his entrepreneurial achievements.
“I am doing research on innovations in Chinese academia. Vanke represents a wave of newly-rising businesses based on accumulation of capital, and the real estate business is super lucrative in China. I also want to see what his expectations are of the Chinese market,” she said.
Lili Ouyang, a student at the Business School, visited Vanke with friends at HBS over the summer and said in Chinese that she was impressed by the way “they really value sustainability and are highly mission-driven, which sets them apart from other real-estate businesses.” Ouyang noted that several HBS students have interned at Vanke.
Wang spoke of studying at Harvard from 2011 to 2013, during which he attended classes primarily at the College. Wang said the experience was both challenging and academically rewarding.
“Harvard was my purgatory,” Wang said. “I started homework at 8 p.m, and never finished before 2 a.m… When I first arrived, I picked five courses. Quickly, I reduced those five courses to four, those four to three, those three to two.”
Mentioning a particularly memorable Harvard course, Wang recalled learning something new about his home country in Cambridge.
“Harvard opened a window for me. It allowed me to recognize myself once again, recognize my nation once again, and recognize my traditional culture once again.”
Most captivating to the audience were stories of his two climbs up Mt. Everest. Wang, who is 66 years old, holds the record for the oldest person ever to have accomplished “7+2,” climbing the highest peaks on all seven continents by 2004 and reaching the North and South Poles by 2005.
Wang also mentioned several near-death experiences while climbing. On a journey up Mt. Everest, the businessman temporarily lost eyesight in both of his eyes as oxygen levels diminished.
“I felt so comfortable, warm, and sweet—I couldn’t help but close my eyes. I felt that as long as I sat down, I would go to heaven,” Wang said. “Those who are trained for mountain climbing know you won’t return from such a beautiful experience. I still wanted to survive in this cruel world. But at that moment, it was very hard to continue to open my eyes and keep walking.”
During a visit to the South Pole, Wang also found a way to blend his interest in outdoor exploration with his growing commitment to environmental issues.
“We took off our clothes and stayed in the snow for 20 minutes, and posted pictures on social media. Just to show that the Pole is not as cold as people think.”
Wang, a rowing enthusiast serving a four-year term as Chairman of the Asian Rowing Association, was in Cambridge for the Head of the Charles Regatta.

UPDATED: October 31, 2017 at 1:11 p.m.
One month after Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, urban planning experts joined students and faculty from the Graduate School of Design Friday to discuss ways to help the island recover after the devastating storm.
At Friday’s event, Puerto Rican landscape architect Jose Juan Terrasa-Soler and Alejandra Castrodad-Rodríguez, former Chief Resilience Officer for San Juan, spoke to a crowd of dozens at the design school.
The event, titled “Hurricane Maria and Puerto Rico: Lessons for Future Urban Disasters,” closely mirrored the format of an earlier event called “Hurricane Harvey and Houston: Lessons for Future Urban Disasters” that brainstormed relief efforts for the hurricane that hit southern Texas in August.  Both events were organized and moderated by Professor Jerold Kayden.
Both speakers proposed long-term solutions to help Puerto Rico recover from the hurricane damage. Even weeks after the storm hit, millions are stranded on the island without electricity and access to running water.
Terrasa-Soler and Castrodad-Rodríguez said that Puerto Rican officials should rethink road locations and urban centers on the island, so that areas experiencing heavy human traffic are less prone to flooding. They also proposed establishing a network of Caribbean islands to support each other in times of disaster. Since Puerto Rico is located off the U.S. mainland, Terrasa-Soler and Castrodad-Rodríguez said shipping supplies from the states to the island has proved difficult.
Students who attended the discussion asked speakers about their thoughts for shorter-term relief.
“What do you think is our best chance? What exactly should we tackle, like specifically, if we want to start from somewhere? Because that’s the hard thing,” said Fabiola Guzman Rivera, a Design School student from Puerto Rico who attended the talk.
In response, Soler-Terrasa said he thought immediate efforts should focus on regaining power on the island.
“We need to get to a level of basic functionality that we need right now and that’s what we’ve been working towards,” he said.
Rosetta S. Elkin, a Design School professor who co-moderated the event, said afterwards that the discussion reflects uncertainty in responding to a recent onslaught of natural disasters. She added that she found it valuable to speak to actual residents of Puerto Rico about the hurricane’s aftermath.
“Being able to talk to contacts on the ground that we know and bring them to students, rather than having us translate knowledge, is, I think, a really important way of learning,” Elkin said.

Former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer spent three low-profile days on campus last week as part of his visiting fellowship at the Institute of Politics.
Spicer attended several off-the-record meals with students, including a lunch on a political communications and a “Director’s dinner,” according to Jason Ge ’18 and Emily M. Hall ’18, co-chairs of the IOP Fellows and Study Groups Program. He also visited several classes, including a freshman seminar, and met with faculty and students from the College, Kennedy School, Business School, and Law School.
Spicer had an “action-packed” visit to Harvard, said Tyler Jenkins ’19, who serves as a liaison in the IOP Fellows program.
“We tried to give him a variety of events to be involved in and talk to as many students as possible, both those who agree with him and those who disagree with him,” Jenkins said.
Spicer’s six months as President Donald Trump’s press secretary were marked by controversy, his often-contentious exchanges with reporters provoking criticism and inspiring spoofs on “Saturday Night Live.”  Following the announcement of Spicer’s fellowship in September, more than 600 Harvard alumni signed an open letter calling on the IOP to rescind its fellowships for Spicer and Corey Lewandowski, President Donald Trump’s former campaign advisor.
Spicer’s visit on campus likewise met opposition from some students and scorn from Twitter pundits.
“I feel like Sean Spicer stood in front of the American people and lied and spread propaganda everyday, and the fact that we're just gonna all sit around the table with him and chat is absurd to me,” said Dominique Erney ’19.
The IOP Twitter account posted a photo of Spicer at breakfast on Wednesday. It received almost 2,000 replies, most of them with snarky or critical responses.
“Largest crowd ever in Boston. Ever,” one user wrote, referencing Spicer’s infamous claim that Trump’s inauguration received a record-large crowd.
In an emailed statement, Ge and Hall said they felt general student reception to Spicer’s visit to be “very good.”
“We’re happy that students engaged in respectful dialogue and were able to ask questions and learn from him,” they wrote.
Jenkins moderated a lunch discussion Thursday with Spicer and Donna Brazile, the former interim chair of the Democratic National Committee. He said the theme of the lunch discussion was about “how we can get bipartisan, get things done, and still stand by our principles.”
Jeannette P. Leopold, co-president of the Harvard Law School Republicans, attended a breakfast discussion with Spicer.
“I thought it was really great that we had the opportunity to meet someone who’s been so influential,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 26, 2017 at 7:28 p.m.
The Undergraduate Council will no longer be able to overturn binding referenda following changes to the body’s governing documents made during the Council’s general meeting on Sunday night.
To be considered binding, UC referenda need to be approved by at least half of the voting population. In the past binding referenda could be overturned by a three-quarters vote of Council members.
In recent years, a number of referenda have appeared on the UC’s presidential ballot each November. Last year, for example, one referendum question asked if “Harvard College should repeal the proposed sanctions on unrecognized single-gendered organizations.” The sanctions prohibit undergraduate members of single-gender social groups from holding campus leadership positions and certain academic fellowships.
In the past, some referenda have been more lighthearted in nature, such as one last year that proposed making the “Harvard Turkey” the University’s official mascot.
However, because the elections are typically characterized by low voter turnout, no referenda in recent years have been binding.
On Sunday, UC Rules Committee Chair Evan M. Bonsall ’19 presented an amendment to the Council’s constitution that would prevent the possibility of overturning binding referenda. Bonsall said low voter turnout makes passing binding referenda rare in the first place.
“We almost never get a majority of students to vote in the November elections,” he said. “This makes it virtually impossible for any referenda to ever become binding, because a majority of students almost never vote.”
Bonsall also noted that the amount of signatures for a referendum to appear on the ballot requires hundreds of more signatures than a presidential ticket to get on the ballot.
After UC Vice President Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18 asked about the the issue of less serious referenda and whether or not this amendment would have changed the results in recent elections, Bonsall said no referenda would have been changed.
“It wouldn’t change the results from any of the referenda votes from the last several years,” he said. “I think we need to trust the students in order to be responsible.”
“This does not make it necessarily like super easy to get a bunch of frivolous referenda to pass,” he added.
The amendment passed.
Also at the meeting, the Council voted to fund a new ping pong table in Apley Court. Now that the UC agreed to fund the table, Apley Court Representative Wilfried J. Zibell ’21 said there are plans to host a ping pong tournament in the building.
The Council also spoke to Presidential Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging co-chairs Meredith L. Weenick and Government professor Danielle S. Allen in an off-the-record session at the beginning of the meeting.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Spirits and temperatures were high along the Charles River Saturday and Sunday, as over 11,000 athletes—along with tens of thousands of spectators—gathered for the 53rd Head of the Charles Regatta. Countless rowers from across the country and around the globe competed for their shot at the coveted title in 66 different races.
“It’s a really exciting weekend to get to race in one of the biggest stages when it comes to rowing,” said senior heavyweight rower Hailey Novis. “I think a lot of us have, at this point, competed on big stages, but just like always, anything can happen, so it’s hard to prepare for things like this. You just have to trust that you put in the work and the time, and [that] it will pay off.”
Given the course’s known difficulty—a result of its five triple-arch bridges—home field advantage proved to be particularly important for the Crimson.
Harvard was well represented at the race, as the men’s and women’s lightweight and heavyweight teams—along with a variety of alumni and club teams—participated in various events over the course of the weekend.
The Crimson teams represented posted impressive all-around performances in both the men’s and women’s categories, collectively taking home a couple of bronze medals, along with a fourth place finish.
The weekend’s top performances for Harvard came courtesy of the lightweight teams, with both the men’s and women’s teams medalling in the latter races of the weekend.
The Crimson women’s lightweights finished third out of eight boats in the lightweight eights, clocking in with a final time of 15:54.28, less than one second behind Boston University, who claimed silver. Stanford finished first in that event, coming in roughly eight seconds ahead of the Harvard boat. They competed also in the fours event, where they ended up as the sixth boat out of eleven with a time of 18:32.12. Georgetown took the top spot in the hotly-contested battle.
The men’s lightweights took home a bronze medal out of 16 boats in the eights division, with a final time of 14:05.27. The race was close up until the very end, as Harvard eventually was edged out by two Ivy League rivals. Princeton took home gold and while Cornell snagged silver a mere four and a half seconds ahead of the Crimson.
The Harvard men’s heavyweights nearly medalled in the weekend’s most anticipated event, the men’s championship eights, but ultimately fell short as they were edged out by Yale for the third place spot. The Crimson finished with a respectable time of 13:34.69 but missed earning a medal by four seconds. Taking home the first place spot was California’s men’s heavyweight team, who finished 17 seconds ahead of the Harvard men’s heavyweight boat.
“It was a bit disappointing because we always want to win on our home course,” heavyweight captain Conor Harrity said. “In the men’s championship eights, our varsity executed well. Unfortunately, it wasn’t enough to win.”
The Harvard women’s heavyweights had a middle of the pack finish, taking 16 out of 36 boats in the women’s championship eights, in an event which Washington ended up winning. The Black and White fared similarly in the championship fours, finishing eighth in a competitive field of 16, of which Brown took home gold.
“We had three boats race in the Champ-4 and two in the Champ-8, and they did really well compared to last year,” Novis said. “We’re really excited that we’re getting to see some definite improvements.”
The Harvard men’s and women’s teams will look to capitalize on the experience of this weekend moving forward. With only one race remaining in the fall season, the Foot of the Charles, the Crimson will turn its attention toward finishing strong heading into spring training.
“The Head of the Charles is an important race and we always want to win.” Harrity said. “However, our racing season is in the spring, and we’re looking forward to race side-by-side against other teams in our dual season, at Eastern Sprints, and the [Intercollegiate Rowing Association Championships].”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For all intents and purposes, Saturday’s matchup between No. 15 Harvard and No. 14 Princeton was likely the Ivy League championship. Last year’s overtime bout ended with the Crimson on top and earned them the respective Ancient Eight crown. This year, they were not so fortunate.
In the defensive battle at Berylson Field—where neither team recorded more than 10 shots—the Tigers got their revenge on Harvard taking the match, 3-0.
As has become the norm, the Crimson (10-4, 4-1 Ivy) began the game with a furious attack on the Tiger’s (9-6, 5-0) net. However, Harvard’s chances were rebuffed by Princeton goalkeeper Grace Baylis. In the 10th minute, freshman midfielder Tessel Huibregsten saw her shot from the left kicked away by Baylis. And so would be the theme for the afternoon. Consistently, great scoring opportunities were stopped by an even better defensive showing from the Tigers.
“We knew it was going to be very competitive and, unfortunately, it did not fall our way,” said Crimson coach Tjerk van Herwaarden. “We had difficulty closing in the circle. Towards the end of the second half, we kept pushing forward to try and get that equalizer. However, they made some plays in the backfield which prevented us from getting those goals.”
In the 22nd minute, Princeton scored the game’s opening goal. Off of a penalty corner, sophomore midfielder Maddie Bacskai collected a rebound and fired her shot into the back of the net.
Just before the stroke of halftime, Harvard found itself with a great chance to tie the game. After a Tiger shot on net, junior defender Olivia Allin managed to clear the ball off the line to prevent the goal. After recovering the ball, the Crimson was able to attack in transition. A foul granted the team a penalty corner, however, sophomore midfielder Bente van Vlijmen was unable to convert the opportunity. Harvard went into the half trailing 1-0.
The Crimson began the second half similarly to the first, with a focused attack on the Princeton net. But, just as before, while the Tigers’ defense bent, it did not break. In the 49th minute, freshman forward Mimi Tarrant saw her close shot blocked.  Just five minutes later, the Princeton lead was doubled as freshman midfielder Emma Street scored on a rebound following a penalty corner.
The Tigers would put the game away with its third goal in the 64th minute. Princeton’s freshman midfielder Julianna Tornetta’s beat Harvard junior goalkeeper, Libby Manela, to a rebound and tapped the ball in for the score.
With the result, the Crimson saw its 13-game Ivy league win streak snapped. Saturday’s result was also the team’s first time being shutout since facing Cornell in 2015. For the Tigers, the team has now gone 206 minutes without conceding a goal, over which time it has recorded two shutouts—the other coming against Northeastern.
“Everyone has things they can work on,” senior goalkeeper Olivia Startup said. “It wasn’t as though the game came down to any one issue or individual. But, we can’t allow ourselves to get defeated when we are down, because this was a new situation for us this season. It was a big lesson for us moving forward for this season, and future ones as well.”
Following Saturday’s action, Harvard returns to play midweek as it faces off against Boston University on Tuesday before hosting Dartmouth on Saturday. The team knows that—while the chances of a repeat Ancient Eight title have decreased—the season is far from over.
“The big thing for us is to make sure we don’t have any regrets,” Herwaarden said. “Every single game starts for 0-0. The Ivy League games do bring a competitive edge to every team. We know that and prepare for it. Regardless, we have the chance to compete for a 13 win season, which would be a fantastic accomplishment for us. There is still a lot for us to gain from the season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Led by its underclassmen, who contributed eight total points, women’s ice hockey defeated Dartmouth 4-1 on Saturday in its season opener at the Bright Landry Center. The night was a total team effort for Harvard with four different players guiding successful shots into the back of the Big Green net.
“One of the biggest things Harvard hockey harps on is the team first mentality,” sophomore goalkeeper Beth Larcom said. “Any game we play, any practice, we’re going to have that mentality. The Dartmouth game was the epitome of that mantra with so many people getting on the score sheet. As coach likes to say, we’re an army of one.”
The first goal of the night for the Crimson (1-0, 1-0 ECAC) came at the conclusion of its second power play. As the timer on the power play expired, freshman forward Keely Moy played a pass to senior forward Lexie Laing, whose shot found its way to the back of the net.
Harvard’s second goal also came off of a power play opportunity. At 14:14 in the second period, the team held a two player advantage, with two Big Green players penalized for interference and cross checking, respectively. Taking advantage of the situation, sophomore forward Val Turgeon played a pass to sophomore forward Kat Hughes at the point. Hughes then fired her shot which rattled off of the net and in for the second point.
Dartmouth (0-1, 0-1) also managed to use the power play to its advantage. At 11:24 in the third period, the Big Green won an offensive zone faceoff. Collecting the puck, junior defender Caroline Shaunessy fired her shot top shelf to put Dartmouth on the board, 2-1.
Undeterred by Shaunessy’s goal, the Crimson didn’t need to wait long to reply. Just two minutes after, Harvard initiated a power play. At 13:44 in the third period, senior defender Chelsea Ziadie flicked a wrist shot from the top of the right circle for the score.
The goal was the second Harvard had netted during a power play. Saturday’s contest against the Big Green served as an encouraging sign for a team that struggled to convert last season. The success at powerplays served as an encouraging sign in the inaugural match.
“Our power play looked good,” junior defender Kaitlin Tse said. “Overall, we want to build off of every aspect of our game as we go throughout the season. That way we can improve and be ready to face any opponent.”
With a firm lead in place, freshman forward Brooke Jovanovich went on to provide the Crimson with an additional insurance goal. At 15:44, Jovanovich broke off on a run where she split two Dartmouth defenders before slotting her shot past the goalkeeper for the score.
This game was one in which the Crimson offense dominated from beginning to end. In total, Harvard outshot the Big Green 43 to 24. On defense, Larcom saved 23 of Dartmouth’s 24 shots. In addition, the team’s defense held strong on power plays, stopping the Big Green on six of its seven opportunities.
“It was a great game,” Tse said. “Collectively we played well to earn a great team win. We had scorers across the board, from upperclassmen to underclassmen. We’re not going to settle; we have big upcoming games against Princeton and Columbia that we want to be prepared for.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s soccer team entered Saturday’s contest in danger of locking in its first losing record in Ivy play since 2007. Facing one of the top teams in the conference, No. 17 Princeton, only served to increase the challenge as the Crimson was on its back foot right from kick-off.
The Tigers found the back of the net for the first time in the ninth minute through senior midfielder Vanessa Gregoire and never let up, scoring a total of six times before the final whistle blew. Eight players recorded at least one goal or assist for Princeton, a number made only more stunning when compared to the 14 outfield players Harvard fielded over the course of the game.
The Crimson (7-8, 1-4 Ivy) was able to keep the contest close in the first half by scoring a goal of its own, but the Tigers (12-2, 4-1) proved too much to handle in the second and ultimately prevailed, 6-1.
“Princeton’s a top-15 team for a reason,” Harvard coach Chris Hamblin said. “At the end of the day, both teams had six shots on goal and it was a matter of Princeton being much more clinical, putting themselves in more clear-cut shooting positions.”
For stretches of the game, the Crimson did indeed threaten. Especially in the first half, directly following Gregoire’s opener, Harvard responded with a flurry of shots and forced three saves from Tigers sophomore goalkeeper Natalie Grossi. The fourth shot on goal, from freshman Linda Liedel, found its way through to knot the score at 1-1.
Princeton immediately snuffed out any momentum the Crimson had gained, however, responding a minute later with a goal of its own. The game-winner came courtesy of sophomore forward Courtney O’Brien, who latched on to a low corner from midfielder Samantha McDonough that had split two Harvard defenders. O’Brien placed the ball perfectly past Crimson junior goalkeeper Danielle Etzel, a common theme all afternoon as Harvard goalies were unable to save a single shot.
Both teams slowed down their pace of play before half, and the Tigers entered the intermission with a one goal advantage.
“It was a great response,” Hamblin said. “We didn’t start the game as well as I would have liked, but the goal woke us up. Sometimes, it takes a trigger to push the team in the right direction, and once we got that push, we tied up the game and played them pretty even for the rest of the half.”
The second 45 minutes was a much different story, however. After both teams recorded six shots in the first half, Princeton outshot the Crimson 8-1 in the second. Junior forward Mimi Asom added the Tigers’ third goal five minutes after the break, and put the game out of reach with her second goal in the 61st minute.
“We didn’t have the quality today to last the game,” Hamblin said. But when we did go down by a couple goals, we wanted to make sure we didn’t call it in and put ten in our box. You don’t learn that way, and even with this difficult loss, I know the team can take a lot away from it.”
As it stands however, the result is Harvard’s worst loss since a 7-0 defeat to UCLA in the 2014 NCAA Tournament. In conference play, it is the worst margin the team has suffered since a 5-0 loss to Princeton in 2006.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the going gets tough, the tough get going—and with just a few games left in the regular season, the Harvard men’s soccer certainly did get going.
Throughout its matchup with Princeton, the Crimson (2-7-4,1-1-2 Ivy) offense began to find its rhythm and created multiple opportunities to score. Though the team had to settle for a draw, Harvard put up a dominant performance against the Tigers (3-6-4, 0-2-2) on Saturday at home.
“I thought we were the better team, but we struggled to impose our game on them for the full 90, which allowed them to keep the ball in the air and play a rather physical game, as opposed to letting us play on the ground and build going forward,” sophomore forward Philip Hausen said. “I thought the guys fought hard and gave it everything they had, we got unlucky to draw that game.”
After an initial deadlock during which neither of the teams got a shot off, the Crimson took control of the game.
The team’s offensive effort began with senior midfielder Christian Sady taking his first of eight corner kicks of the half. Though the team did not score on that opportunity, it did remain in its attacking third. As Harvard found ways to string passes together, and wear down Princeton’s defense, several opportunities came.
Several players contributed to the offense during the opening minutes of the game, including freshman defender, midfielder Fernando Doctors, midfielder, forward Paolo Belloni-Urso, junior defender, midfielder Jack Miler, and co-captain and defender Justin Crichlow. From more corner kicks, to headers, to shots from around the penalty box, the Crimson seemed likely to score at any moment and appeared to leave no room for Princeton to respond.
But Princeton was not to be outdone. After being held to just one shot by Harvard’s defense during the first 21 minutes of the game, the Tigers finally had a proper look at the Crimson’s goal. A corner kick by Matthew Mangini followed by header shot from Jeremy Colvin proved to be the Princeton’s best chance at goal, as they found themselves in their attacking third just twice more after that brief stint there during the 20th and 21st minutes.
Each of the Tigers’ offensive efforts was shut down by a solid Harvard defense, which either blocked their shots or forced them to take bad shots. Senior goalie Kyle Parks only had to make two saves the entire half.
Aside from the handful of opportunities that Princeton had, the Crimson maintained control during the later part of the first half, outshooting its opponent 10-4 and taking nine corner kicks. Though it could not capitalize on the opportunities it had, Harvard had the momentum going into the second stanza.
Maintaining that momentum and dominance in the second half, though, proved to be a bit more of a challenge. The Tigers made the first move, making an attempt at goal six minutes in. The Crimson quickly responded with offensive pressure of its own, and for the next twenty minutes, the Ancient Eight rivals played an increasingly physical game as they traded fouls and shots on goal.
The scoreless deadlock was broken in the 77th minute when Princeton’s Bryan Prudil intercepted a pass at midfield and sent a through ball to freshman Gaby Paniagua, who put the ball past Parks to score his first career goal.
Harvard regrouped quickly, and seven minutes later found itself in a position familiar throughout the game: in its attacking third, and getting set up for a Sady corner kick. Whereas in the other attempts Sady had been unlucky in connecting with teammates who would be able to convert, Doctors managed to find the ball at the near-side post. Doctors chipped the ball over to Hausen, who found the back of the net for the equalizer.
“We’re starting to string together solid performances now,” co-captain defender Eric Gylling said. “I don’t know if we can… work with our standings in the Ivy League very much at this point but it’s definitely a big plus to come together and have these solid performances now.”
With this draw, the Crimson still may be in the running for an Ivy title, but with little room for mistake. It must keep up its current level of play in the last few games of the season.
“No matter what we’re going to keep trying to win...and improve,” Gylling said. “If the standings work out and we’re still in it then great, but otherwise it’s all about finishing the season and building the program.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While much attention was paid to the Head of the Charles Regatta results over the weekend, another Cambridge contingent was competing in its own clash.
Representing the Harvard women’s tennis team (3-0, 0-0 Ivy) in the ITA Northeast Regional Championships in Philadelphia, Pa., were sophomore Jenna Friedel, freshman Anna Li, sophomore Irene Lu, and captain Annika Ringblom. In the qualifier for the national tournament, Friedel, Lu, and Ringblom contended in the singles portion, while Ringblom and Li paired together in doubles.
The most impressive play from Crimson competitors came from Ringblom and Li, who reached the semifinals of the doubles bracket only to fall in a tiebreaker to the Dartmouth pairing of sophomores Racquel Lyn and senior Kristina Mathis on the contest's penultimate day.
“I am very proud of the way that Anna and I competed this weekend,” Ringblom said. “It is very exciting to have made it to the semi finals of regionals in Anna's first year of competition and my last.”
This group fared slightly better than last year’s group, as the pairing of junior Erica Oosterhout and former captain June Lee were only able to reach the quarterfinals in doubles. Oosterhout matched Lu’s accomplishments in singles. For the first time players in the event, the tournament proved a valuable experience.
“I'm very grateful I had the opportunity to travel to Philadelphia to participate in the tournament,” Friedel said. “I know I speak for everyone when I see it's an honor to represent Harvard on the road.”
Of the three Harvard singles participants, Lu was seeded the highest. The Laurel, Md., native’s 17/32 ranking provided her with the Crimson’s only first round bye. The sophomore used it to her advantage, as she proceeded to quarterfinals of the event–the furthest of any Harvard entrant.
Lu’s progression through the tournament began relatively smoothly. A 6-1, 7-6(5) victory over UMass Amherst senior Ana Yrazusta subsequently followed a 6-3, 6-2 sweep of Columbia sophomore Ali Pollack. However, the sophomore was ultimately outclassed in her next and final match at the Hamlin Tennis Center. Syracuse sophomore Miranda Ramirez efficiently played her way to a routine triumph, holding Lu’s tally to four total games over two sets.
Ringblom and Friedel had similar progressions to one another through their portion of the 128-player bracket. Both were knocked out of the tournament in their second-round matches in three sets, after having triumphed in their opening round bouts with identical 6-2, 6-2 margins. The senior and sophomore had entered the weekend with a collective 6-7 record in solo play this fall.
Doubles proved more fruitful for Ringblom in Philadelphia. Coming into the regional championships with a 5/8 seed, the duo of Ringblom and Li were expected to proceed deep into the tournament. The pair met those expectations and more.
They began by besting two Ancient Eight pairings from Yale and Columbia back to back. After subsequently topping Fordham’s Carina Ma and Estelle Wong as well as St. John’s Jaide Collins and Zofia Stanisz to reach the semis, more Ivy League competition lay ahead in the Dartmouth pair Lyn and Mathis.
The Crimson came out strong, handily winning the first set, 6-2. Ringblom and Li could not continue their momentum, however, as Lyn and Mathis dug deep and struck right back, claiming the second set, 6-1. In the resulting tiebreaker, the fourth ranked Big Green had just enough in the tank to finish off Harvard, 10-6.
Having completed their weekend matches, Ringblom and Li’s record as a pair improved to 7-1, a team leading mark. Ringblom credits their success so far this season to the complementary nature of their individual strengths.
“We have great chemistry as a doubles pair, with her success coming from her strong net game and mine at the baseline,” Ringblom said. “We communicate very well and I am excited to build off these great results before moving into our spring season.”
As the Crimson players continue to gain confidence playing as a team, their level of play should only improve heading into dual season.
“Overall, I think everyone is very happy with the direction [Harvard women’s tennis] is going in,” Friedel said. “With our main focus on the spring season, we want to make sure we're playing the right way and continuing to make adjustments to be ready to face off against Ivy League competition.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a thrilling battle of neck-and-neck sets, the Harvard women’s volleyball team topped Dartmouth three sets to none Friday night. On the road, Harvard took three straight back-and-forth sets against the Big Green (7-10, 3-5 Ivy). It was a game of inches with each one of the Crimson’s set victories coming at a margin of no more than three points.
The victory for Harvard (11-6, 6-2) places them at second place within the Ancient Eight, tied with Princeton. Both programs are each only one game behind Yale in the Ivy League title race.
In the first set, the margin between the two teams did not surpass two points until a kill by junior captain Christina Cornelius gave the Crimson a 15-12 lead in the set. From that point on, Harvard kept a two or three-point cushion for the rest of the set, eventually taking it 25-23.
“We weren’t focused at first, but in the middle part of the set we really dialed in and that allowed us to take the set,” sophomore blocker Maclaine Fields said. “I think our passing was really strong, which allowed us to run a really strong offense.”
The second set proved more volatile, with each squad trading multiple groups of three point streaks early. The Crimson lept ahead 18-17 late in the set on a kill from freshman hitter Mindie Mabry and did not look back, holding that lead for the remainder. Harvard would take the set 25-22.
Dartmouth, however, refused to go down easy. The third set would prove the most challenging of the night for the Crimson.
The Big Green, hoping to avoid a straight sweep, came out of the gates strong, scoring four straight in the final set and taking a commanding 8-2 lead. With Harvard’s back against the wall in the third set, the Crimson scored four of the next five points to get back into the game.
Harvard slowly started chipping away at the Dartmouth advantage, eventually climbing back to regain control of the game with its first lead late in the set at 17-16. The Big Green would tie up the score multiple times, but the Crimson now had control for good. The final nail in the coffin came off another Mabry kill, giving Harvard the game 25-23 and the match in three straight sets.
“The whole time, point-by-point, it was a really close match, but overall we were definitely in control, focused and playing our game,” junior blocker Jocelyn Meyer said. “In the third set we really saw our hard work from practice and our calm and confidence really paying off.”
The Crimson slightly edged out Dartmouth 44 to 43 on kills. The Big Green scored 53 points to Harvard’s 52, perfectly describing the constant tug-of-war of the night.
Sophomore hitter Grace Roberts Burbank led the Crimson on the night with 17 kills and a .300 hitting percentage. Sophomore setter Erin McCarthy racked up another 40 assists, putting her season total at a team-leading 669.
On the defensive side for the squad, junior defensive specialist Anna Uhr continued her solid play, coming up with 16 digs. Uhr leads the team on the season with 184 digs.
This win gives Harvard the season sweep over Ivy League foe Dartmouth, as it topped the Big Green three sets to one in September. These victories in Ancient Eight play will prove important down the stretch for the Crimson, with a tight race atop the Ivy League that is sure to come down to the end of the season.
“We still have a real opportunity to grab the title or a share of the title,” Meyer said. “We want to be the team that can finish it off in three sets every time. Anything can happen in the Ivy League.”
