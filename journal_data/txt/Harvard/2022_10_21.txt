After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After years of public and private debate, K-pop group BTS announced early Monday morning that all seven members of the K-pop juggernaut will enter the South Korean military over the next several years. The announcement comes just two days after the band’s last scheduled concert and provides fans and onlookers alike resolution to a years-long debate over how the South Korean government would handle the band's mandatory enlistment.
All South Korean men are required to enlist by the age of 28 and must serve for a minimum of 18 months. BTS’s oldest member, Jin, was initially set to enlist by December of 2020; however, the South Korean government created a new exception just three days before the artist’s 28th birthday. The so-called “BTS Law'' allows K-pop stars who have been awarded South Korea’s Hwagwan Orders of Cultural Merit to apply to postpone their military service until the age of 30.
The announcements come just four months after the group spurred confusion after walking back an announced “hiatus” and transition to “Chapter 2” of the band, which involves members focusing on solo projects amid ongoing group promotions.
In a message posted by the group’s management company on the artist-to-fan communication website “Weverse,” the company writes “as each individual embarks on solo endeavors, it’s the perfect time and the members of BTS are honored to serve.”
The post revealed that Jin plans to enlist following promotions for the release of his upcoming solo single at the end of October. The other six members — RM, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook — are expected to enlist over the next several years with the company promising a “reconvening” of the group around 2025.
While seasoned K-pop fans are no strangers to the enlistment of their favorite male idols, groups have historically taken different approaches to enlistment. Some have taken lengthy hiatuses where members establish solo careers, while others have remained active, promoting as groups or subunits while missing some members. Notable idols currently serving include Baekhyun of EXO and SHINee’s Taemin.
Yet, many wondered if BTS might again be the exception. The group is an economic powerhouse: BTS reportedly contributes over $3.6 billion dollars annually to the South Korean economy and is responsible for an estimated 1 in every 13 tourists in the country. Analysts have projected that BTS will have contributed $29.1 trillion dollars to the South Korean economy between 2014 and 2023 when considering both direct and indirect contributions.
Beyond their economic impact they’ve also been friendly with the South Korean government, participating in government sponsored performances and events. All members of the group were sworn in as presidential envoys and awarded diplomatic passports before speaking at the UN for the second time in 2021. But after years of indecision and back and forth from government officials, many fans are speculating that the group is choosing to enlist on their own terms rather than await a final decision.
Reactions from BTS’s loyal fanbase, ARMY, have been mixed. On the most extreme end, fans went as far as proposing a boycott of all things related to South Korea until the group’s return in 2025. But in the true spirit of BTS, the majority of fans online were quick to make light of the situation, flooding twitter with memes. Creative fans wasted no time in pointing out the irony of the fanbase's name, repurposing the famous Spider-Man pointing meme to show that both BTS and their fans were ARMY now. Other fans opted to opine on the attractiveness of the inevitable haircuts the members will receive upon entrance into the Military.
Still, many fans took to Twitter to express their sadness about the prospect of three years without new content from Bangtan. Some even expressed concern over the safety of the members during their service. While K-pop idols almost exclusively serve in non-combat roles and are unlikely to face physical danger, there is a long history of idols struggling to assimilate into the military given their fame. Most notably SHINee’s Taemin was forced to change roles amid deteriorating mental health last year. Given BTS’s unprecedented level of fame, some fans worry about their privacy and safety while serving.
While many fans were shocked by the surprise announcement, there's no doubt that BTS’s loyal ARMY will be eagerly awaiting the group's return in 2025. The announcement concluded with a promise to fans citing the band's most recent single, “Yet To Come (The Most Beautiful Moment),” which promises “much more yet to come in the years ahead from BTS.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Recount a time when you faced a challenge, setback, or failure. Reflect on a time when you questioned or challenged a belief or idea. Discuss a period of personal growth and a new understanding of yourself or others. If all else fails, explore a background, identity, interest, or talent so profound that not doing so would leave our idea of you fundamentally incomplete.
Exactly the sort of small talk you want to make with strangers.
American college essays — frequently structured around prompts like the above — ask us to interrogate who we are, who we want to be, and what the most formative experiences of our then-short lives are. To tell a story, to reveal ourselves and our identity in its entirety to the curious gaze of admissions officers — all in a succinct 650 words.
Last Thursday, The Crimson published “Rewriting Our Admissions Essays,” an intimate reflection by six Crimson editors on the personal statements that got them into Harvard. Our takeaway from this exercise is that our current essay-generating ethos — the topics we choose or are made to choose, the style and emphasis we apply — is imperfect at best, when not actively harmful.
The American admissions process rightly grants students broad latitude to write about whatever they choose, with prompts that emphasize personal experience, adversity, discovery, and identity — features often distort student narratives and pressure students to present themselves in light of their most difficult experiences.
When it comes to writing, freedom is good — great even! The personal statement can be a powerful vehicle to convey an aspect of one’s identity, and students who feel inclined to do so should take advantage of the opportunity to write deeply and candidly about their lives; the variety of prompts, including the possibility to craft your own, facilitate that. We have no doubt that some of our peers had already pondered, or even lived in the shadow of, the difficult questions posed by the most recurrent essay prompts; and we know the essay to be a fundamental part of the holistic, inclusive admissions system we so fervently cherish. Writing one’s college essay, while stressful, can ultimately prove cathartic to some and revealing to others, a helpful exercise in introspection amid a much too busy reality.
Yet we would be blind not to notice the deep, dark nooks where the system that demands such introspection tends to lead us.
Both the college essay format — short but riveting, revealing but uplifting, insightful but not so self-centered that it will upset any potential admissions counselor — and the prompts that guide it push students towards an ethic of maximum emotional impact. With falling acceptance rates and a desperate need to stand out from tens of thousands of applicants, students frequently feel the need to supply the sort of attention-grabbing drama that might just push them through.
But joyful, restful days don’t make for great stories; there are few, if any, plot points in a stable, warm relationship with a living, healthy relative. Trauma, on the other hand — homophobic or racist encounters that leave one shaken, alcoholic parents, death, loss and scarring pain — makes for a good story. A Harvard-worthy story, even.
For students who have experienced genuine adversity, this pressure to package adversity into a palatable narrative can be toxic. The essay risks commodifying hardship, rendering genuinely soul-molding experiences like suffering recurrent homelessness or having orphaned grandparents into shiny narrative baubles to melt down into a Harvard degree. It can make applicants, accepted or not, feel like their admissions outcomes are tied to their most vulnerable experiences. The worst thing that ever happened to you was simply not enough, or alternatively, it was more than enough, and now you get to struggle with traumatized-imposter syndrome.
Moreover, students often feel compelled to end their essays about deep trauma with a statement of victory — a proclamation that they have overcome their problems and are “fit for admission.” Very few have figured life out by age 18. Trauma often sticks with people far longer, and this implicit obligation may make students feel like they “failed” if the pain of their trauma resurfaces during college. Not every bruise heals and not all damage can be undone — but no one wants to read a sob story without a redemption arc.
A similar dynamic is at play in terms of the intensity of the chosen experience: Students feeling for ridges of scars to tear up into prose must be careful to avoid cuts too deep or too shallow. Their trauma mustn’t appear too severe: No college, certainly not Harvard, wants to admit people who could trigger legal liabilities after a bad mental health episode. That is the essay’s twisted pain paradox — students’ trauma must be compelling but not too serious, shocking but not off-putting. Colleges seek the chic not-like-other-students sort of hurt; they want the fun, quirky pain that leaves the main character with a new refreshing perspective at the end of a lackluster indie film. Genuine wounds — the sort that don’t heal overnight or ever, the kind that don’t lead to an uplifting conclusion that ties in beautifully with your interest in Anthropology — are but lawsuits in the waiting.
For students who have not experienced such trauma, the personal essay can trap accuracy in a tug of war with appealing falsities. The desire to appear as a heroic problem-solver can incentivize students to exaggerate or misrepresent details to compete with the compelling stories of others.
We emphatically reject these unspoken premises. Students from marginalized communities don’t owe college admissions offices an inspirational story of nicely packaged drama. They should not bear a disproportionate burden in proving their worthiness.
Why, then, do these pressures exist? How can we account for the multitude of challenging experiences people have without reductionist commodification? How do you value the sharing of deeply personal struggles without incentivizing every acceptance-hungry applicant to offer an adjective-ridden, six-paragraph attempt at psychoanalyzing their terrible childhood?
We don’t have a quick fix, but we must seek a system that preserves openness and mitigates perverse pressures. Other admissions systems around the world, such as the United Kingdom’s UCAS personal statement, tend to emphasize intellectual interest in tandem with personal experience. The Rhodes Scholarship, citing an excessive focus on the “heroic self” in the essays it receives, recently overhauled its prompts to focus more broadly on the themes “self/others/world.” We should pay attention to the nature of the essays that these prompts inspire and see, in time, if their models are worth replicating.
In the meantime, students should understand that neither their hurt nor their college essay defines them — and there are many ways to stand out to admissions officers. If it feels right to write about deeply difficult experiences, do so with the knowledge that they have far more to contribute to a college campus than adversity and hardship.
The issue is not what people can or should write about in their personal statements. Rather, it’s how what admissions officers expect of their applicants distorts the essays they receive, and how the structure of American college admissions can push toward garment-rending oversharing. We must strive for an admissions culture in which students feel truly free to express their identity — to tell a story they want to share, not one their admissions officers want them to. A system where students can feel comfortable that any specific essay topic — devastating or cheerful — will not place them slightly ahead or behind in the mad, mad race toward that cherished acceptance letter.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In today’s Nairobi, streets that were once named after British colonizers now feature the names of Kenyan freedom fighters and Pan-African leaders. The state house, which used to be the official residence of the governor of British East Africa, is now the home of the president of Kenya. The iconic Kipande House — which, during colonial times, was where Kenyans applied for identification cards that permitted them gainful employment and the right to travel — now hosts one of the largest commercial banks.
Such is the contradiction, or perhaps harmony, that describes postcolonial Nairobi. What was once a place of cool waters — “enkare nyrobi” — has evolved from what it was before and after  British colonization. Nairobi is a beautiful microcosm of different cultures, old and new, modern and traditional. Our language of choice is Sheng – Swahili, punctuated with English and elements of Gikuyu, Kamba, Dholuo, and Luhya. The complexities of Nairobi represent contemporary Kenyan identity.
But, close to 60 years after independence, Kenya still grapples with the effects of colonialism. There is no shortage of colonial ideology and attitudes present in our land, from our education system to the values we espouse. The colonists did not just come, plunder, and leave. In their wake, they left the stench of colonization that we still bear today.
From a very young age, the idea of Western superiority is imprinted onto our minds — we are taught to hate the things in us that are African. In schools, we are often asked to shave our heads because our African hair is “unsightly.” We are forced to acknowledge the apparent good that came with colonialism and are told that we ought to be grateful to the British for “civilizing” us. Mastery of the English language is often treated as a measure of intelligence. We constantly try to differentiate ourselves from our Africanness and seek approval from those who, against our better judgment, we perceive to be better than us. This, perhaps, has been at the root of many of our problems. While there are problems in Kenya that are of our own making, I do believe that the colonists were — and still are — the architects of many of our misfortunes.
Along with the bad taste of colonization left in our mouths, Kenyan youth and African youth at large must wrestle with how to curate a postcolonial African identity — an identity we can call our own. There is an understanding that the pre-colonial identities we once adorned and cherished are long gone. Kenyan life before British intervention has been almost entirely erased, so while we can try to retrace it, we can only recover part.
However, even with the little we can recover, we can still redefine what it is to be African. The path forward for many African countries must be to find how traditions and cultures that had been erased fit in the world we live in now — the world that was imposed onto us by colonizers.
Therefore, we must actively debate, fix, unlearn, adjust and create new cultures together. We must understand that development for us will look very different from having endless skyscrapers, building powerful manufacturing industries, or beating the dollar, as is the common vision in Western nations. Development for Kenya may take the form of sustainable agriculture, which has been shown to enhance economic growth while reducing carbon emissions. Our development may be stimulated by Africa’s abundance of renewable energy sources. Or it may come from technological innovations that suit the particular needs of Kenyans. Such unique trajectories of development constitute the complexity of Kenya and should not be stunted by repressive Western ideals of progress.
The rest of the world, however, doesn’t seem to envision this complexity, or simply chooses to ignore it. The true Africa contradicts the Africa that the rest of the world, particularly the West, wants to see. The world wants an Africa that is free of modernization. An Africa with purely “traditional” cultures that are untouched and remain static for the world to appreciate with ease – a cultural museum of sorts. A Taylor Swift’s “Wildest Dream”-esque Africa, one with beautiful lush savannahs and bright orange sunsets but without Africans in it. The world wants an Africa that is riddled with problems, impoverished and unable to help itself, constantly in need of relief and salvation. The world wants to see an Africa where oppression is all there is, where democracy doesn’t exist, where no one has rights: an Africa to demonize in order to uplift  Western civilization.
At Harvard, and in academia at large, such a retrograde understanding of African identity permeates discourse on Africa. People engage with African identity by flattening it out to simplicities. From class conversations to political debates, there seems to be very little appreciation of the complexities of African culture and identity. This shouldn’t be the case. The Africa the rest of the world fantasizes about is not the Africa that exists in reality. Africa is evolving on its own path, and it is high time the rest of the world contends with this.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was that time of year: clubs budgeted for buses to New Haven, organizations coordinated spare beds, and peers shopped for crimson-colored clothing. The Harvard-Yale football game was, and still is, an orchestrated effort for the entire campus. Back in 2019, I’d only been a real Harvard student for a few weeks, but even that much was apparent to me. It’s a social expectation, a cultural norm steeped in hundreds of years of tradition. A communal habit. It is simply what Harvard students do.
Whether we acknowledge it or not, the first-year versions of ourselves were concerned with fitting in. Not just into the culture on campus, but into what the world perceives as the Harvard mold. And as malleable pieces of putty souped up on praise, many of us were ready to fill all the crevices to look, talk, and act like a Harvard Student would.
But as I strived to emulate the Harvard legacy, I couldn’t make it to The Game, or any game, in my freshman year. Instead, I was off-campus performing somewhere. One weekend, I was at Dickinson College for Rare’s BE.Hive On Campus, a climate-focused summit bringing together students, scientists, nonprofits, and activists to propose sustainable solutions for college students and the world.
It was my first performance alone. My poem “On Climate Denial” was ready to be presented to an audience of behavioral scientists, climate activists, and students in a newly renovated auditorium with candy-colored bean bags at the foot of the stage. The lighting, probably dim to conserve electricity, casted soft shadows on the two, three chattering clusters of people. I was lucky to be invited in the first place, but it never feels good to perform for an empty audience.
This wasn’t the centuries-old Game. This was just another school event, and you have to be a certain kind of person to attend a climate change summit on a Saturday morning. Back then, if it wasn’t for my speaker status, I’m not sure I would’ve been that kind of person. It’s simply not what college students do.
But, they did.
I walked out onstage to an auditorium so full I couldn’t find my mother in the crowd — even with my glasses on. Groups of friends huddled together on the beanbags, squeezing together for an ounce of comfort. Even after the performance, as I crept into the stands to listen to the rest of the speakers, I was approached by students who eagerly shared the initiatives they were pushing on campus, the classes they took, and the community garden they kept.
A year later in 2020, Dickinson College became one of the first ten colleges or universities in the country to achieve carbon neutrality. Even after this milestone, the campus continues to forge a sustainable future by utilizing their 80-acre organic farm, implementing behavioral-focused programs like the EcoChallenge, and testing new eco-friendly practices on their own campus. Students are required to take a course on sustainability, but 88 percent of their graduates end up taking at least two and 54 percent take at least four. Dickinson College has been recognized as a top performer for five consecutive years in the Sustainable Campus Index.
This is simply what Dickinson students do.
Environments shape actions shape culture; we see it all the time. When you charge extra for grocery bags, people bring a reusable one or shove their CVS snacks in their coat pockets.
When you stick a sign on the washer encouraging students to clean their clothes in cold water, they default to that.
Universities meet young people at a point in their life where they’re not only expecting, but embracing change. Colleges have a unique influence on students’ day-to-day lives and communal traditions, presenting a perfect opportunity to build climate-friendly habits that graduates can take with them.
There are changes I’ve seen around campus — unplugging larger appliances during breaks, using behavior-sensing lights and hand dryers, installing reusable water bottle fillers around campus, and reselling things at the end of the year — but those are all just the start of shaping sustainability at Harvard.
Replacing individual microfridges with community ones, supplying house kitchens or dining halls with easily accessible air fryers and other small appliances we’re not supposed to have, hang drying clothes, exclusively serving plant-based meals one day a week, integrating sustainability courses into the General Education requirements: all of these are actionable changes that can build the practice of sustainability at Harvard. But such cultural shifts don’t come from the middle of nowhere — they’re crafted through a combined effort of students and campus leadership. Together, we set the tone and create the initiatives that become cultural norms. But this can only happen when we, the students, start the conversation.
It’s up to us to open our eyes to the future of our campus. It’s up to leadership to help us realize that vision. But we all have to choose to see it.
That is what Harvard students do.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council on Monday called on Harvard Law School to bolster its reproductive rights education and voted to raise fees paid by commercial real estate developers toward a public fund for affordable housing.
During a Monday meeting, the Council unanimously voted for a resolution voicing support for the hundreds of HLS students who staged a full-day sit-in at the Law School earlier this month. The resolution endorses the students’ three main demands: that HLS hire a full-time reproductive justice professor, create a clinic for reproductive rights, and institute a reproductive justice curriculum.
Speaking during a public comment period in the meeting, Samantha J. Nagler, a third-year student at the Law School, called the lack of reproductive rights education at HLS an “injustice to its students.”
“I hope that the City of Cambridge will support our advocacy to hold Harvard accountable and push it to be a leader once again,” she said.
Vice Mayor Alanna M. Mallon, a co-sponsor of the resolution, said the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade this summer added urgency to the need for legal education about abortion rights.
“We know it’s going to take every one of us to fight against the oppressive nature of some of the laws that are coming forward now after Roe v. Wade was overturned,” Mallon said during the meeting.
“Reproductive justice is an important field of law,” she added. “And Harvard should be stepping up in this moment to support these students.”
The resolution calls on the city to send a copy to the Law School. Jeff Neal, a HLS spokesperson, declined to comment on the Council’s resolution.
The move reflects an increased focus on abortion from the Council following the Supreme Court’s decision. Last month, councilors expressed their intention to ban controversial limited-services pregnancy centers that do not provide abortions, but the city’s Law Department raised concerns about constitutionality.
During Monday’s meeting, the Council also amended the city’s zoning code to raise “linkage” fees, paid by commercial real estate developers toward Cambridge’s Affordable Housing Trust, from about $20 per square foot to more than $33 per square foot — a 66 percent increase. Cambridge’s linkage fee now more than doubles Boston’s fee of around $15 per square foot.
The amendment exempts some projects from the linkage fee, including the first 30,000 square feet of smaller developments and those that involve demolishing and rebuilding existing spaces for the same use.
In an interview last month, James G. Stockard Jr., a lecturer at the Harvard Graduate School of Design and a trustee for the Affordable Housing Trust, praised the “aggressive” fee increase and said it is unlikely to significantly slow down development. He added that a moderate slowdown in development “wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world.”
“Development is going to keep on happening in this community almost regardless of the ways in which the city regulates it and places limits on it,” Stockard said.
“It makes sense to keep this number going up, and at some point, probably, it will start to slow down some of the larger developments,” he added. “If we don’t like that as a city, we could back off a little bit.”

Chanting “women, life, freedom” and lying in front of the John Harvard Statue, Harvard students staged a “die-in” in solidarity with Iranian and Kurdish protesters on Thursday.
Around 40 protesters gathered for chants and speeches outside University Hall, with some expressing disappointment at the lack of an official statement in support of Iranian and Kurdish protests from University President Lawrence S. Bacow.
Protests erupted in Iran following the Sept. 16 death of 22-year-old Zhina Mahsa Amini in police custody after she allegedly broke the country’s rules on headscarves. Since protests began, Iran’s Human Rights Activists News Agency estimates that more than 230 people have been killed during demonstrations.
“We have gathered today to stand in solidarity with the people of Iran whose voices are being suppressed and lives are being put in danger while advocating for women, life and freedom,” said Ciara S. Moezidis, a Harvard Divinity School student who co-organized the protest. “It is important for all of us at Harvard to use our privilege to amplify the voices that are being silenced.”
Dalal Hassane ’26 also spoke at the demonstration to call for justice for Amini and other Kurdish people, a minority group in Iran that faces deep-rooted discrimination, per Amnesty International.
“We are tired of being told that this is not a Kurdish struggle, that this is only about women's rights,” Hassane said in her speech. “This resistance movement cannot be successful without the fight for Kurdish liberation.”
Saba Mehrzad ’25, who helped publicize the event to College students, said she hoped the demonstration would push the University to issue a response to the deaths and protests in Iran.
“Our main goal is to get President Bacow to release a statement in support and solidarity with the Iranian protesters,” Mehrzad said in an interview before the demonstration. “It’s a little disappointing that after weeks of protests, we haven’t had a statement.”
Harvard spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment on student criticisms of the University’s response.
During the die-in, organizers read off names and ages of some of the known victims.
“Showing physically that these people are being murdered and are losing their lives in defense of freedom is a powerful image,” said Miriam S. Israel, a Divinity School student and protest attendee interviewed after the demonstration.
This is Harvard’s second demonstration this fall in support of Iranian women and Kurdish people. Undergraduates held a September protest on the steps of Widener Library which attracted around 50 Harvard affiliates.
Elom Tettey-Tamaklo, a student at the Divinity School and a freshman proctor, attended the protest hoping to call the University out on its lack of response.
“For me, it’s the silence of institutions like Harvard, who are supposed to be at the forefront of progressive thoughts and seeking truth,” Tettey-Tamaklo said. “When issues like this come up in our world — great human rights abuses — the University is silent.”
“You need to hold the University accountable for its silence,” he added.
Clarification: October 22, 2022:
This article has been updated to indicate that Ciara S. Moezidis was the co-organizer of the “die-in” demonstration, not the sole organizer.

Officials from the city of Boston presented initial plans to conduct a study into a potential new community center in Allston at a public meeting on Thursday.
The event — hosted by the Boston Centers for Youth and Families, the Public Facilities Department, and the Mayor’s Office of Neighborhood Services — is the first of four scheduled community meetings before a final report is set to come out in spring 2023 detailing plans to replace the existing Jackson/Mann community center.
State Representative Kevin G. Honan, a Democrat of Allston-Brighton, said the current Jackson/Mann facility is deteriorating, with leaks and other structural building issues.
“I realize the building is in terrible shape,” he said, adding that “the Jackson/Mann community center has been vitally important to the Allston-Brighton community for 47 years.”
Marta Rivera, commissioner of the Boston Centers for Youth and Families, said the city plans to study the prospects of expanding from the current facility.
“The goal of this study is to address the ‘what,’ ‘where,’ and the ‘what’s possible,’” she said at the meeting.
Rivera added that the city hopes to expand programming, operating hours, and accessibility with the new construction.
“We’re limited by hours of operation, we’re limited by space,” she said.
Anthony P. “Tony” D’Isidoro, president of the Allston Civic Association, praised the city for taking on the project, but expressed concern about the new community center’s potential impact on election administration. The current facility houses polling locations for multiple precincts.
“I hope that that process is already underway — that once the community center closes next summer, there is a plan in place to efficiently relocate the five precinct locations as well so that there is plenty of equity involved and people can easily, in those precincts, get to their polling locations,” he said at the meeting.
Brett Bentson, a principal at the design firm Utile, which is working with the city on the project, said the study will seek to incorporate feedback from residents.
“Understanding what the community wants these programs and uses to be gets really to the heart of this study,” he said.
Bentson announced plans to launch an online survey to collect data on the existing uses of the community center and to study how it can be improved through the development of the new facility.

When Grace R. Kim ’23 met with a recruiter from Elon Musk’s for-profit company SpaceX during her junior spring, they offered her a job “on the spot.”
Kim was meeting with the company representative to discuss a potential collaboration between the spacecraft engineering firm and the student group Harvard Students for the Engineering and Development of Space. But she left the discussion with a summer job in hand.
For undergraduate students at Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, there exists a well-worn pipeline to opportunities in the corporate world.
Engineers, especially those like Kim with a Harvard degree, are widely in demand for an array of high-paying industry jobs, including at tech companies, biotech corporations, and financial firms. In 2022, more than 56 percent of SEAS graduates reported that they planned to go to the for-profit world.
But for those hoping to go into engineering jobs in public service — making up only 3 percent of SEAS undergraduates in the class of 2022 — the path is far less clear cut.
Noting the difficulty of discovering and pursuing nonprofit career opportunities, some undergraduates hope for additional support in forging the way to public service work and boosting engagement among the broader student body.
“I think the biggest challenge for potential nonprofit work at the beginning is becoming aware of those opportunities, both within the States and globally,” said Layla J. Seaver ’24, co-president of Harvard’s chapter of Engineers Without Borders.
The appeal of industry jobs is evident: they often come with lucrative starting salaries, attractive exit opportunities, and, often, the prestige of a big-name firm.
“You certainly can have a job that pays the bills in your discipline and working in nonprofits, but we shouldn’t kid ourselves to say you’re going to make the same salary that you might if you were with Google or Facebook,” said Chris Lombardo, the associate director of undergraduate studies in electrical engineering and mechanical engineering at SEAS. “That’s an unrealistic expectation.”
Pathways to corporate work are easy to find at Harvard, said Giovan N. McKnight ’24, who serves as HSBSE vice president.
“I feel like that’s always being thrown at me, even over email lists,” he said. “I’m constantly getting emails about it.”
A range of undergraduate student groups based at SEAS offer opportunities for students to build professional portfolios in engineering and technology, helping direct them into summer and post-graduate employment.
The Harvard College Engineering Society, which describes itself on its website as “the umbrella student organization for Harvard engineers,” published a 49-page guide to engineering concentrations in 2020, offering step-by-step guidance for wooing corporate recruiters.
“Engineers make good money. Engineers have an easier time finding jobs. Engineering is a respected profession,” the guide states as reasons to pursue a career in the field.
Other student groups, like Women in Computer Science and the Harvard Society for Black Scientists and Engineers, aim to boost SEAS students from historically underrepresented backgrounds by hosting panels and recruiting events with industry partners, such as Vatic Investments, Bloomberg, and Brex Inc.
SEAS student Connor J. Schoen ’20, who co-founded the nonprofit Breaktime in his first year at the College, said he believes “going into industry has a more linear and clear path to it” than philanthropic or entrepreneurial work.
“You’ve got to go through this interview process, this is how you prepare, these are the employers,” he said. “It’s sort of something that there’s already more of an established guide to how to do it.”
For undergraduates not drawn by the appeal of corporate posts and salaries, public service careers offer an alternative way to make use of a SEAS education.
SEAS offers several public service engineering opportunities, including a required course that asks students to work on a team-based project to address real-world problems for clients. In the class, Engineering Sciences 96: “Engineering Problem Solving and Design Project,” many students conduct humanitarian work.
As with corporate job hunts, student organizations often serve as a starting point for landing public service employment, according to some students.
Engineers Without Borders, one of Harvard’s most popular socially oriented engineering student organizations, has helped direct many engineering students to humanitarian work around the globe.
Yasmine Omri ’24, the organization’s co-president, said she was drawn to nonprofit engineering work by the opportunity to “build things that change lives.”
EWB’s work with international stakeholders emphasizes sustainability and partnership, Omri said.
“We don’t do work for the communities — we really try to listen to their needs,” she said. “And another big emphasis is to make sure that all the materials are sourced locally and that the skills are also developed locally.”
“You also get to learn a lot about other cultures,” she added. “You really widen your perspective.”
Omri said EWB receives “a lot” of funding and advising support from SEAS, and Seaver, the other co-president, also said it benefits from being “so well funded” by the school and “well respected” among faculty with a strong support system.
Students are also able to connect with public service initiatives outside of SEAS, such as the Phillips Brooks House Association, the Mindich Service Fellowship, and the Harvard Kennedy School Social Innovation Fellowship.
Schoen, the Breaktime founder, said the HKS Fellowship advanced his nonprofit startup.
“What I was doing was a bit atypical because, even for other folks who are starting up companies, many of them are for-profit, many of them are focused in the sciences and engineering — they weren’t focused in human services,” he said.
“A lot of what I was doing required a lot of support from other parts of the university — for example, the Cheng Social Innovation Fellowship at Harvard Kennedy School, which was absolutely life-changing for me,” he added.
SEAS itself is “receptive and open” to non-industry engineering, according to Alexander G. Dyer ’24, who co-led an EWB project in Kenya with fellow SEAS classmate McKnight.
Suvai Gunasekaran ’13, who was involved with EWB for her entire time as an undergraduate, credits her exposure to public service work through the organization with giving her the “hands-on” nonprofit engineering experience to launch her career.
She later became vice president of engineering for a fellow EWB member’s water nonprofit, SPOUTS of Water, where she designed ceramic water filters for a factory in Uganda.
But even with these curricular and extracurricular offerings, students interested in public service are often left to “pioneer their own paths,” said Lombardo, the associate DUS.
Outside of public service clubs, “individual opportunities are harder to come by,” according to Seaver.
Omri described the low number of students in nonprofit engineering as a “cycle” perpetuated by a lack of early awareness.
“We don’t have that many opportunities for public service, so people don’t hear about them early on, and then after that, they’re really focused on this industry side,” she said.
Seaver suggested that the school could better advertise public sector opportunities, adding that such a move could help entice students who have never before considered nonprofit work.
“Advertising those opportunities more would be super beneficial, not only to students who know they’re interested in that, but perhaps students who are not even aware of those opportunities and haven’t ever considered it before,” Seaver said.
Dyer, an EWB participant, pointed out the difference between providing exposure to nonprofit employment and actively encouraging students to pursue that path, saying the school could do more to champion opportunities for public service work.
“I think commitment implies a level of forwarding, a kind of pushing,” he said. “I don’t really know how much there is.”
Other students and alumni expressed similar desires for additional school and faculty support.
Robert D. Newman ’23, co-president of the Harvard Undergraduate Clean Energy Group, said humanitarian projects are often less structured and therefore require more “startup effort” by students.
“I’d say, one of the biggest problems is that usually these projects are driven by a few really passionate individuals, and when they leave, these projects kind of die off,” he said. “For new ones to be brought forth, it requires a lot of startup effort by students.”
Similarly, Gunasekaran said that, at Harvard, the EWB chapter “had enough to survive and do well, but it definitely wasn’t a big focus of people in the engineering field.”
“There was never any pushback, but there was also never any encouragement for it,” Gunasekaran said. “I was just doing my own thing without any faculty involvement.”
In an emailed statement, SEAS spokesperson Paul Karoff wrote that the school seeks to provide an array of public service opportunities to students.
“Through curricular and co-curricular offerings, SEAS is committed to providing students with opportunities to explore internship and career options across the many sectors in which the skills of engineers and applied scientists are in high demand — industry, academia, nonprofits/NGOs, and government,” he wrote.
Lombardo suggested Harvard could potentially allocate additional resources to nonprofit endeavors that would benefit engineering students who want to do public service work.
“That could be a strong benefit for those students who have interests in combining STEM with a social justice or nonprofit purpose,” he said.
Further support for nonprofit opportunities could be achieved by encouraging collaboration among administrators and faculty across the University, he added.
“I think any sufficiently important, tangible, hard problem is never going to be solved by a single discipline or group,” Lombardo said. “We’ve got the top researchers, we have access to the top practitioners on this campus and in our networks. Why can’t we bring that together to make a significant impact?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
United States Representative Barbara J. Lee (D-Calif.) called for the federal government to establish a “commission on truth, racial healing, and transformation” during a Harvard Institute of Politics forum on Thursday.
Thursday’s forum served as the keynote event for the Institutional Antiracism and Accountability Project’s annual Truth and Transformation conference, hosted by the Harvard Kennedy School’s Ash Center this week.
In conversation with Melissa V. Harris-Perry, a professor at Wake Forest University and former MSNBC host, Lee discussed racial justice in the United States and called for policymakers to consider reparations.
“This country has never had its truth-telling moment as it relates to the Middle Passage and the impacts of enslaving so many people for so many years,” Lee said. “After genocides, crimes against humanity, slavery, you can’t heal without people coming forth.”
Lee also discussed the contemporary impact of slavery in the U.S.
“We’ve seen the manifestations of the enslavement of Africans through the murder of Mr. George Floyd, for example; through the disparities in healthcare, through Black and brown people dying disproportionately from Covid,” she said. “You can’t separate that from the trajectory of enslaving Africans to today.”
Lee said a truth commission would need to be both “intergenerational” and “intersectional.”
“It’s got to have people who are impacted by the legacy of slavery,” she said. “We’ve got to have young people to vision what the future looks like without these barriers of systemic racism, we have to have academics and historians, and we have to have a couple of politicians on it, because they have to help shepherd the reparations and the final conclusion of this process through the United States Congress.”
She added that descendants of people who benefited from slavery should be included in a commission “so they, too, can understand their connection — but not from a guilt perspective, but to tell the truth about what took place.”
“It has to be an environment that’s conducive to them coming forward,” Lee said.
Lee and Senator Cory A. Booker (D-N.J.) officially introduced the legislation in Congress that would establish a United States Commission on Truth, Racial Healing, and Transformation back in Feb. 2021.
Asked by Harris-Perry about what reparations would look like in practice, Lee said the commission should be tasked with determining specifics, pointing to a state-established reparations task force in California as an example.
Lee also discussed the “very fragile” state of American democracy, criticizing former President Donald J. Trump and his supporters in the Republican Party.
“They’re very close in trying to create a system of government that mirrors autocratic rule and fascism,” Lee said.
“Elected officials, you elect them and you need to hold them accountable, “ Lee added. “That’s what democracy is supposed to be about.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The proportion of American Harvard Kennedy School students identifying as Black or African American fell by two percentage points in 2022 as the school’s student body and faculty remain overwhelmingly white, according to an annual diversity report released by the school Thursday afternoon.
The Kennedy School, which only collects data on the racial diversity of its students who are U.S. citizens, saw the proportion of its students who identify as Black or African American drop to nine percent in 2022, compared to 11 percent in 2021.
The percentage of students who identify as Hispanic or Latinx declined for the second consecutive year to 12 percent, down one percentage point from 2021, while the proportion of students who identify as white declined for the fourth year in a row to 51 percent.
Lindsey Batteast, a second-year master of public policy student at HKS and member of the school’s Equity Coalition, said she was disappointed and concerned by the diversity report.
“It makes students question how much faith they can put in the HKS administration to not only promote diversity, equity and inclusion, but also ensure that it’s a pillar of our community, in the sense that we actually see it in adequate representation,” Batteast said.
The proportion of Asian students at HKS increased by five percentage points from 2021 numbers, reaching 23 percent. The school reported no students of Native American, Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian, or Native Pacific Islander backgrounds.
The Kennedy School does not present data about the race and ethnicity of its international students because “race and ethnicity are interpreted differently in different settings around the world,” according to the school’s diversity report. This year, a majority of the Kennedy School’s student body is from outside the U.S., with 52 percent of students hailing from non-U.S. countries and territories.
While HKS slightly improved gender diversity within its faculty, tenured professors at the Kennedy School continue to be disproportionately white and male. The proportion of tenured professors who identify as white rose to 78 percent — up one percentage point from 2021 — while 72 percent identify as male, compared to 74 percent in 2021.
The Kennedy School does not have a single tenured professor of Native American, Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian, or Native Pacific Islander backgrounds, and only two tenured professors identify as Black.
Khalil G. Muhammad, who is one of two Black tenured professors at HKS, said the school’s progress on improving its diversity is “not sufficient.”
“The pace of change at this point appears to be glacial,” Muhammad said.
Muhammad said that this year’s report demonstrates the Kennedy School must change its strategy when it comes to recruiting a diverse group of students and faculty.
“The same approaches in the past are not going to work in the future, if we are to take seriously the fact that our faculty does not come close to reflecting the demographics of the country we live in and the expertise, both lived and professional, that comes with those demographics,” he said.
In a statement to The Crimson, HKS Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf wrote that the Kennedy School is “continuing to pursue strategies to increase the diversity of the HKS community, as has occurred over the past few years.”
“Fostering a diverse and welcoming community is essential to our mission because recruiting and empowering the best people makes us better at what we do, because we learn more from people with different perspectives, and because we work in diverse groups and serve diverse societies,” Elmendorf wrote in an email to HKS affiliates Thursday.
Taylor J. Jones, a second-year HKS student who serves as co-president of the Black Student Union, said more attention should be paid to yield rates.
“It’s one thing to offer admission to the student; it’s another thing to ensure that a student can actually enroll in the institution and thrive there,” Jones said. “I think the Kennedy School might need to take a closer look to what some of those obstacles might be.”
Muhammad said the Kennedy School’s lack of a single tenured faculty member of Native background is “a glaring problem” given the increasing amount of work done in the field of Native American and Indigenous Studies.
“There isn’t, best I can tell, a sense of urgency about this,” he said of efforts to increase diversity in the HKS faculty. “And that’s going to have to change.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“We’d like to say it's just not a game. Obviously that’s not the case, it's a big game,” remarked Harvard field hockey head coach Tjerk van Herwaarden ahead of the highly anticipated Harvard-Princeton match this Sunday in Princeton, N.J.
Since 2016, Harvard and Princeton have traded first place spots every other year in Ivy League standings. Last season, Harvard earned a well-fought 2-1 victory over the Tigers in Cambridge in a penalty shootout. At the time, Harvard was 17-1, on a 12 game winning streak, and had a 0.944 winning statistic. Princeton was 10-7, on a two game winning streak with a 0.588 winning statistic.
Now, the two schools display similar statistics. Harvard has won four of its past five regular season meetings against Princeton. The Crimson currently holds the number one seat in Ivy League standings. But both schools are 4-0 in conference records this season. Harvard has a current 0.786 winning statistic and Princeton closely follows with 0.714.
“I think the reality is that we are two very good teams,” van Herwaarden said. “It could be a little bit luck, it could be a little bit of the form of the day, which eventually makes a bit of a difference.”
The truth is that Sunday’s game could go either way. Harvard is a young team equipped with a number of first-years and sophomores who have since stepped up into leadership roles. But Princeton retains a large number of then-juniors, now-seniors that some of Harvard’s older players have experience playing against.
“We have three seniors to start, Princeton has eight. That could make a big difference in the game and the pressure of the game itself,” the head coach stated.
“Which one is the better one, I guess we’ll find out on Sunday.”
Though Harvard is young, its first-years have been some of the most instrumental in the season thus far. First-year Bronte-May Brough, who also happens to be the Ivy League Defensive Player of the Week, leads the team in points (19) and is third in the Ivy League in points and goals.
Princeton may have the age, but Harvard brings both new skills and old experience. Brough, in addition to teammate Kitty Chapple ‘26, played in the Junior World Cup for England. They are not strangers to competing in games with large stakes despite lacking first-hand experience with the Harvard-Princeton rivalry. To accompany this talent, Harvard is equipped with a roster of returning players who are familiar with the competition Princeton will bring, to boot playing and beating teams like No. 5 Louisville and No. 7 Michigan.
“This has never been about, you know, ‘let's do again what we did last year’ or ‘build upon what we did last year,’” van Herwaarden recalled. “But it still can help what we did last year because we have a lot of people rejoining playing these types of games.”
“We will look to those people to step up this upcoming weekend and to do the right thing.”
Nonetheless, this game in particular has been part of what the team has prepared for since the start of the season.
“At the end of the day, this is what we have prepared for since the middle of August,” van Herwaarden commented. “People have been here before…we’ve seen it before in the last five, six years…this has been the game that decides the Ivy League championship.”
But Harvard heads into this Ivy game just as any other: grounding themselves in their strengths and being aware of how and where they can be attacked.
“I think we are the team that realizes that we can go down in the game, we prepare for it to that extent but knowing that we have enough power to score goals.”
In the Crimson’s recent game against Dartmouth, which they won 3-2, Harvard unusually trailed first in the first quarter.
“The first goal came a little unexpected and I think out of nowhere as well with maybe two or three individual mistakes, one little misjudgement on the last play,” van Herwaarden said.
“We definitely had a little bit of difficulty with the field, the ball bounced a little bit differently than we typically see, so that really gave Dartmouth the easy lead to that extent.”
But the Crimson took no time to respond, as only two minutes later, Brough scored her seventh of the season from a penalty corner.
The game remained 1-1 until late in the fourth quarter till Brough broke the tie. The Big Green, however, then scored off of a deflected penalty corner, something that is rarely seen in field hockey.
“I don’t see that ever happening again where a deflection gets that much height and really finds the back of the cage,” the head coach reflected.
“In all fairness, a really good executed corner is really difficult to stop…it presented us with something that you really rarely see in field hockey and that led to the second goal and we were able to get more of a level of competitive drive in us and get a third goal back at the end of the game.”
And that competitive drive propelled first-year Kate Oliver to put one in the net, leading the Crimson to a well-fought victory.
In the Delaware game, 2-1, Harvard scored first, but needed another fourth quarter goal from junior Mazarine Broze to edge the Blue Hens 2-1.
“Scoring first is of course always pleasant—it builds confidence in the game itself, you force your opponent to work a little bit harder and put more time and effort into it to get the goal back,” van Herwaarden commented.
“When you look at the Delaware game, especially in the second half, we were completely dominating and were able to put a lot of technical pressure onto their circle,” he continued.

Though the score might not have displayed it, the Delaware game was much better executed than Harvard’s match against Dartmouth: the team connected much better and played more competitively.
“We were more competitive knowing that Delaware would be a stronger team and I think we really prepared for it well…in general that we were definitely the more dominant side.”
Next up, Harvard will hit the road for its match against Princeton on Sunday at 12:00 PM EST.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming into this year, senior running back Aidan Borguet and senior wide receiver Kym Wimberly were both expected to be major contributors to the Harvard (4-1, 2-0) offense and help make up for the handful of dynamic playmakers who graduated after last season. The two flashed potential throughout the Crimson’s 8-2 campaign last season, with Borguet toting the rock 115 times and Wimberly leading the team with more than 450 yards receiving. Pair that high-flying duo with a healthy Charlie Dean, the team’s senior signal-caller who missed the last four games of last season due to injury, and Harvard seemed to have a wealth of experience and talent at the major offensive skill positions.
Five weeks in, the triumvirate has blown these expectations out of the water.
Start with Dean, the man under center –  rather, in the modern offensive style that Harvard plays, in the shotgun. After struggling in the team’s season opener at home against Merrimack in what was his first start in almost a calendar year, the Odessa, Fla. native has gone on to throw for 984 yards and nine touchdowns in the four games since, completing almost 60% of his throws. More importantly, after going undefeated in his starts in 2021, the quarterback has continued his winning ways. Dean especially shined in the team’s Ivy League opener against Brown, in which he torched the Bears defense for 282 yards through the air and four scores.
On the receiving end of two of those touchdowns in Providence was Wimberly, who has emerged as a safety valve for Dean and one of the top receiving threats in the Ivy League. A figure who had already carved his name into the Crimson football canon with his game-winning touchdown catch in The Game against Yale last season, Wimberly has demonstrated a similar streak of clutchness so far this season. In the Merrimack game, which featured a frantic Harvard fourth-quarter comeback, the senior hauled in a 27-yard catch and a 36-yard catch in the penultimate and ultimate drives of regulation, respectively, paving the way for Borguet to score on both drives. In the squad’s lone loss so far, a 30-21 defeat to Holy Cross on Oct. 1, Wimberly’s 19-yard scoring catch in the third quarter kept the Crimson within striking distance.
The team likely wouldn’t even have been close against the Crusaders without Borguet, who rushed for two touchdowns in that contest, his second multi-score game of the season in addition to the win at Brown. Borguet has seamlessly adjusted to the role of lead back after playing behind Aaron Shampklin last season, as he leads the Ivy League in rushing yards (620) and is third in the FCS in yards per game (124). The senior brings a rare combination of evasiveness and strength to head coach Tim Murphy’s and offensive coordinator Mickey Fein’s offense, allowing the Crimson to gain solid yardage often on early downs. At the same time, he is a constant threat to break off a major run, as evidenced by his 67-yard touchdown run against the Bears. On that play, Borguet ran directly into his own offensive lineman behind the line of scrimmage, then bounced left, broke a tackle, and exploded into the open field and away from any Brown defender in sight.
“I’m just proud of the character that has been shown through a lot of the games so far,” Borguet said.
Proving his words, the team has received contributions throughout the year from young difference-makers such as sophomores Ledger Hatch, a deep threat at wide receiver who can take the top off of a defense, and defensive lineman Dominic Young-Smith, who snagged an interception last week against Howard.
While Borguet and Wimberly have garnered headlines and accolades, it is impossible to break down the success of this Harvard team so far without pointing to its experienced, bend-but-not-break defense. Senior defensive lineman and team captain Truman Jones has anchored a unit that has come up with big stops when needed and has benefitted from timely play at all levels of the defense. In the Merrimack game, for instance, senior defensive lineman Nate Leskovec came up with a massive sack of Warriors quarterback Gavin McCuster late in the fourth quarter, ensuring that the game would go to overtime. Against Brown, Bears quarterback Jake Willcox was able to march up and down the field for much of the fourth quarter, but senior defensive back Khalil Dawsey knocked down a desperation third-down heave with under thirty seconds to go to protect the Harvard lead.
As the Crimson looks ahead to its final five games, all against Ivy League opponents, it will need to continue to come up with big plays on the defensive side while using Borguet’s talents to win the time-of-possession battle. The next two contests, at home against Princeton (5-0, 2-0) and away against Dartmouth (1-4, 0-2) will offer the chance for some comeuppance, as the Tigers and Big Green are the only two teams who beat the 2021 Harvard team. Against these rivals, the Crimson will also hope that its special teams squad, led by assistant coach Jon Poppe, can continue to raise eyebrows: against Cornell, senior linebacker Kobe Joseph got his hand on a punt that ended in a 17-yard return touchdown for junior defensive back Jelani Machen, a feat that was almost matched by senior defensive back James Herring when he blocked a punt last weekend against Howard.
Whatever the result on the scoreboard against undefeated Princeton on Saturday, the Crimson will undoubtedly play with the tenacity that Murphy has preached in each of his 28 seasons at the helm, the never-give-up philosophy that has led him to become the winningest coach in Ivy League history.
“Our coaching staff gives us motivation and really just lets us know that we have to be ourselves and we have to continue to execute the way we want to,” Borguet said.
Borguet, Wimberly, Jones, and the other seniors on the roster hope that their inspired play will bring Murphy his tenth Ivy League title in the season’s closing contests.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For competitors, coaches, and spectators alike, the Head of the Charles Regatta is a spectacle. For one weekend each October, it is hard not to feel energy on the Charles River as crew teams from around the world flood its waters with hopes of victory. Some crew diehards, like Harvard men’s lightweight head coach Billy Boyce, have the opportunity to see this scene from multiple perspectives. After taking part in the HOCR as both a rower and a coach, Boyce experienced the regatta from multiple points of view while establishing himself as a key figure in collegiate crew, both in and out of the boat.
Boyce’s illustrious crew career began when he walked on to the team at Cornell University in 2004 with limited rowing experience under his belt. He was placed in a First Freshman Eight at a time when Cornell had not won a championship in over a decade. The upperclassmen were determined to lead Cornell’s comeback in the Ivy League and set the tone by encouraging discipline and organizing training sessions outside of scheduled practice. Boyce embraced this intense culture as a walk-on.
“We had a chip on our shoulder, and we were determined to out-work a league that didn’t expect much from us,” Boyce wrote in an email. “We developed a fiercely competitive dynamic between our top two eights that pushed both boats to Sprints wins [at the IRA National Championship Regatta] in 2006, despite coming in poorly ranked. After that, Cornell went on a run that hasn’t been matched since.”
After this surge of momentum, Cornell went on to win two more national championships, amounting to three IRA championships in total during Boyce’s time as an undergrad. However, despite its success in national competitions, Cornell never medaled at the Head of the Charles while Boyce was a rower; instead, the team used the race as motivation for winter training.
“I raced Head of the Charles a couple of times and remember it as exhilarating, if not a bit chaotic,” Boyce recalled. “I only remember a few controversial moments from races – for example, a crew in front of us failed to yield and started swearing at us, and pushed us to the outside of a turn. As athletes, we used it as fuel through the winter and kept it in mind when we raced them in the spring.”
Nowadays, as a coach, Boyce has a similar attitude towards the Head of the Charles. Without diminishing the significance of the regatta, Boyce is very aware of the fact that the HOCR is merely the first race of the season and should not be used as a bellwether for the spring season several months down the road.
“Teams must be careful not to let a good result breed complacency; nor can they let a bad result discourage them,” Boyce wrote. “The important thing is to keep grinding, keep developing and to be ready for the real season in the spring.”
But the unpredictability of rowing is exactly what Boyce loves about it. He compared crew to the MLB, where a team’s success can dramatically change from year to year. Luck can change quickly in collegiate rowing, depending on the dynamic of the boat and the work ethic of the team that year. As a result, each person in a boat provides a crucial component to the team’s success, and no one star can carry a team to victory.
“Lightweight rowing is a beautiful sport because the margins are tight and the unexpected can and often does occur,” Boyce wrote. “This all amounts to what I find so compelling about the sport – a crew can be greater than the sum of its parts and do something nobody expects.”
Once Boyce graduated from college, his enduring love for the sport prompted him to intern at his alma mater. From there, he served as an assistant coach at Yale before coming to Harvard as an assistant coach for the heavyweight squad for five seasons and eventually ascending to his current position.
Under Boyce’s leadership, the lightweight team won the points title at the IRAs and finished with a 9-1 dual record before a three-year hiatus due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Upon their return, the squad’s varsity four boats finished second in the grand final at the IRAs.
One highlight of Boyce’s time at Harvard is the crew he coached to an IRA gold, the heavyweights’ 2nd Varsity squad. Boyce credited the rowers’ collective strength, rather than any of their individual times, for outpacing their opponents in the final leg of the Sprints.
“It was a crew that gave me heart attacks but was also fun to be around because they were so confident, knew their abilities and knew how to execute,” he wrote. “They always found a way to win.”
This year, Boyce and the lightweight squad have high hopes for the season and look forward to using the HOCR as a springboard for the spring season.
“We’re excited to race this weekend, but I tell our guys it’s a small step on a much longer journey,” Boyce wrote. “Whatever the result, we’ll get back to work next week, grinding, keeping our process going and shaping our competitive mindset to be able to execute with confidence come Spring. We get it right and we’ll be able to race with anyone in the league.”

Our dearest Berg is a place where all first-years should feel welcome. But after pulling excessively hard on the one door that doesn’t open and fumbling with your ID as the hangry post-Ec10 lunch line forms behind you, there is one more obstacle left before you can enjoy your meal: simply, where the heck do you sit? Don’t worry, we gotchu. Here’s the game plan for finding the perfect seat:
1. Scope It Out
We know you’re hungry, and we know you have your eyes locked on the boom-boom sauce, but it’s vital that you do some recon. Take note of any weak points in the armor (i.e. tables where everyone is spaced a few seats apart and you can all eat alone together). It is important that you do not panic or abort the mission. Later when you’re balancing your cup of oat milk, blue Powerade, and all the utensils you took thinking you were going to get soup, you’ll be thankful you know the lay of the land.
2. Lock onto a Target
Allow yourself a maximum of thirty seconds for this step. You don’t want to be that person standing there awkwardly like a lost tourist. Not to mention that people will jab you in the back with their trays if you block their way (not speaking from experience, or anything). Dig deep into the recesses of your memory to find a face you recognize. No connection is too weak, so think Visitas, pre-o, or even that kid who uses you as a shield while they sleep in lecture.
3. Take the Scenic Route
This alternative approach is basically buying you time. Time for you to notice your suitemate tucked away by the exit, or the girl from your hometown meet-up who you haven’t gotten to actually talk to yet. This is also a chance for people to notice you, so put a little swagger in your walk. If someone shouts your name at any point during this step, you’ve officially been saved. Please give this special friend all of your tater tots for the rest of the semester.
4. Be Brave
We know coming up to someone new (or god forbid a group of new people) can be intimidating. But just remember that everyone has been in your shoes at one point or another. Be basic — start with the Harvard intro: name, hometown, and dorm. Then move on to the spicier stuff. What’s going down in Tasty Basty this weekend? Does anyone know your section crush? Is CS50 all just a conspiracy? You’ll likely find that you have a lot more in common with your new friends, besides just the time you eat dinner.
Whether or not you find your future spouse at a random Annenberg table, or even if you immediately forget the person you ate with as soon as you step out of the dhall, your first year at Harvard is all about meeting new people. Now add some veggies to your plate, grab a drink, and don’t drop your tray — because then, even we can’t help you.
