After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
This spring, the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert & Sullivan Players and Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club are teaming up to produce a modern remake of Gilbert and Sullivan’s operetta, “Patience; or, Bunthorne’s Bride.” The original operetta is set in England and includes lovesick maidens and the petty British Dragoon Guards. The production’s re-imagining of the operetta takes place 100 years later on American shores, turning maidens into flower children and Dragoon Guards into brutalized, crippled marines returning from the Vietnam War.
 
With an impressive cast of 19, the operetta centers on the beautiful Patience (Claudia D. Oh ’17) and her search to determine the true meaning of love from the attempts of both the self-centered Reginald Bunthorne (Joseph S.H. Goodknight), and the flawless, widely-loved Archibald Grosvenor (Zachary Mallory) to court her.
 
The production stays true to the light and humorous tone of the Gilbert and Sullivan original. “There are many opportunities to poke fun… and we take advantage of that at every opportunity,” Goodknight says. “That is what I am most looking forward to—giving the people who come see the show some good laughs.”
 
The tension between the show’s comedic mood and the context of soldiers returning from war proved to be a creative challenge. “I attempted to add an undertone of tension and conflict to particular scenes while maintaining the overall light nature of the operetta,” movement director Talia K. Rothstein ’17 says. “I am excited to see how this contrast—which is also reflected in the set, the blocking and the music—plays out when all the elements of the show come together.” 
 
For director Matthew W.G. Walker ’16, the operetta’s larger goal is to leave the audience thinking long after the curtains close. “I would love for the audience to leave with one or two questions and perhaps different ways of approaching or looking at those questions. For our production, this might include questions about the search for love and maintaining identity in a chaotic world.”

Saturday Night Live comes to Harvard in a brand new way with “SKETCH.” Running from March 27 to 29 in the Loeb Ex, director Karen Chee ’17 offers a fresh take on Harvard theater, diverging from the plays and musicals often produced through the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club with a night of sketch comedy. This comedic production aims to bring together Harvard’s funniest and wittiest in a process that allows directors, writers, and performers to work together to find new ways to make people laugh.
 
This effort to creatively join forces serves as the backbone of the production’s development. “‘SKETCH’ is unique in that the idea process has been so collaborative,” assistant stage manager Cassie E. Lowell ’17 says. “Immediately after casting, the team’s writers sat down with the actors and asked them what sorts of ideas they want to see happen on stage, so everything you’ll see is original material that so many people collaborated on.” Writer and properties designer Devon M. Guinn ’17 agrees. “The best part has been the collaboration between the writers due to the way Karen sets up meetings, which involve a lot of group discussion and feedback.”
 
Many of those working on the production see Chee’s project, which will feature both onstage and as digital shorts, as potentially being a wild success. In fact, the project has garnered much support from some of the most prominent improv comedy groups on campus––including the Immediate Gratification Players, On Thin Ice, Three Letter Acronym, and the Harvard University Stand-Up Comic Society––who will each open one of the four performances next weekend.
Chee’s excitement for the show’s opening can hardly be contained. “It’s been amazing working with the cast. They’re all such talented and naturally funny people, and I can’t believe I’m lucky enough to get to work with them,” she says. “It’s been amazing to see what they each bring to the show and how their different skill sets mesh on stage.”

A child draws a tall ladder on the wall. A young girl grasps onto numerous balloons, attempting to fly. Trapped inside the wall, a horse peeks pitifully out from its small square. Two children rendered in black and white stenciling play with a sand pail. However, they are not part of the beautiful, idyllic beach scene in color, shown through a tromp-l’oeil crack in the wall. This graffiti, found anywhere else, may seem cynical. But on Israel’s West Bank barrier, the pieces are no longer just examples of dark humor; they serve as a political tool, intended to shed further light on a particular social issue. 
Sometime in early August of 2005, Banksy, a pseudonymous graffiti artist and political activist from the United Kingdom, created nine pieces of graffiti on Israel’s West Bank barrier. He had already been known as a subversive artist wearing a notorious paper bag over his head to protect his identity. In 2003, he painted on animals in an exhibition titled “Turf War.” In 2004, Banksy produced counterfeit ten-pound notes, substituting the Queen’s head with Princess Diana’s. Someone dispersed the bills at the Notting Hill Carnival that year, creating a logistical nightmare as some people tried to use the bills at local shops. With the rest of Banksy’s tongue-in-cheek repertoire, the paintings on the barrier wall in 2005 come as no surprise. But his works on this wall are especially significant because of their use of graffiti specifically as a political medium in situ—that is, they place a work of social commentary in the very origin of the issue.
The Israeli West Bank barrier has been a site of extreme controversy, facing international scrutiny since construction began in 2002. While Israel argues that the barrier protects Israeli civilians from terrorists, the United Nations and the International Court of Justice asked that the barrier be removed in 2004. However, Israel ignored this request. The barrier is a separation wall that lies along the West Bank, partially along the 1949 Armistice line between the Israeli and Palestinian West Bank. The wall’s length was supposed to be around 430 miles, and in 2012, 273.2 miles had been completed, while 35.2 remained under construction. 
For Banksy, the controversy that surrounds the wall is what makes it such a perfect location for his art. Shortly after completing his graffiti on the wall, Banksy wrote on his website, “How illegal is it to vandalize a wall if the wall itself has been deemed unlawful by the International Court of Justice? The Israeli government is building a wall surrounding the occupied Palestinian territories. It stands three times the height of the Berlin Wall and will eventually run for over 700 km—the distance from London to Zurich. The International Court of Justice last year ruled the wall and its associated regime illegal. It essentially turns Palestine into the world’s largest open-air prison.” Banksy created his graffiti under the belief that the wall should not exist.
Not only are Banksy’s works considered contentious, they are also sometimes treated as criminal. According to his website, while Banksy was creating his artwork a soldier asked him, “What the fuck are you doing?” before threatening the artist. Jo Brooks, Banksy’s spokeswoman, elaborates further on the precarious situation: “The Israeli security forces did shoot in the air threateningly, and there were quite a few guns pointed at him.” 
What sets Banksy apart from other protestors are the aesthetics of his protest. Although illegal in many areas, graffiti also maintains an undeniable artistic appeal. The beach scene, shown through the stenciled crack of the wall, is beautifully painted on with bright hues of blue and green. Even the child with the chalk, in its stark shadowing of black and white, maintains a certain sense of beauty. Banksy’s conversation with an old Palestinian man emphasizes this bizarre interlacing between aesthetics and protest. When the man said Banksy made the wall beautiful, he initially thanked him. However, the man responded, “We don’t want it to be beautiful, we hate this wall. Go home.”
Banksy’s graffiti on Israel’s West Bank barrier wall is significant in that it renders a form of illegal protest beautiful and posits it as an artistic activity. In using an illicit medium to express opposition, Banksy draws on a historical notion of protest—fighting against an established set of rules. But in using graffiti to do so, Banky presents political protest as art. Art is no longer the marker of high civilization, and conversely protest is no longer only for marginalized members of society. No matter what issue Banksy fights against, he refashions protesting in his art. Through his graffiti, Banksy takes the problems of a few that are begging to be exposed and transforms them into art for many. He travels to the source of a problem and transforms it into a beautiful piece of protest.

The morning that Button dragged the spotted owl in from the woods was the morning that Ranger Cooper stopped by Foxglove for lunch. Royella had introduced Cooper as one of Dad’s colleagues, and I had recognized him as the bearded ranger who had come looking for Royella earlier that summer, mumbling something about assessing timber. Dad was out completing a work project, and his absence turned lunch into yet another awkward affair.
We passed around a platter of sandwiches, and Royella broke the silence by revealing that back in the day she had gone to prom with Ranger Cooper. Collin snorted, Aunt Taylor shifted her chair away from Cooper, and Button chose that moment to proudly prance in.
“Button,” Aunt Taylor cooed before registering the dead bird in his teeth. “Button, oh my God! What did you do?” Collin sprang up and wrestled the carcass from Button’s proud jaw.
“Miss Taylor, looks like your little pooch is a mighty hunter,” Cooper said, unable to control his throaty laughter. “He’s become a real mountain dog. That bird is almost as big as he is!”
Collin locked Button outside and placed the feathery carcass on the floor beside the table. He and Cooper examined it.
“Don’t get blood on the finish,” Royella cautioned. I could hear Button whimpering outside.
“There isn’t much,” Collin said. “Just a wounded leg.”
“Guess little Butt isn’t a hunter after all,” Cooper began laughing all over again. I crouched down and looked at the bird: its frozen dark eyes, its lifeless wings, its brown feathers flecked with white, and its mangled left leg, chewed by Button up to the joint.
“What kind of owl is it?” I asked Cooper. 
“I’m not exactly sure,” he said.
Royella brought a bird book from Dad’s shelf while Aunt Taylor fetched Button from outside, complaining that Collin shouldn’t have punished her dog if the bird was already dead when Button found it. I expected that Button would lunge for the corpse again once inside. Instead, he lay peacefully still, grunting softly as Taylor cradled him in her arms.
“Yessir, it’s a spotted owl,” Cooper concluded after looking through the pages of the bird book. “That’s what I suspected!” He plucked a tail feather and held it up in the daylight. “I just had no idea they nested in this particular area,” he said after studying the shimmering object. “Gotta notify the wildlife service.”
“Why?” Royella crouched quickly, pulling her dress over her knees and looking from the bird book to the carcass.
“You know, ’cause they’re protected, bein’ borderline endangered,” he said. “Protecting their habitat’s part of being a ranger.” His visible pride annoyed me.
Taylor stood up suddenly, placing Button on the bench beside her. “Come again?”
Cooper explained that one spotted owl meant there might be others. He said that the wildlife center would likely conduct a survey to see if this owl belonged to a larger community whose forest habitat they should protect from developers, loggers, farmers, and certainly hunters.
Taylor and Royella began to bicker with Cooper over whether or not one dead owl meant there would be others. No one but Collin and I seemed to notice or care that Button was lying motionless on the bench, his pink tongue stuck out between little white teeth, his breathing shallow. 
 
*
 
Later, while Aunt Taylor and Royella drove Button to the vet, Ranger Cooper drove Collin and me down a series of nausea-inducing logging roads to meet up with Dad.  I spotted his pickup by a grove of cedars. He was out working, busily marking the smaller trees, which would be cut for fire safety, with red spray paint. When he noticed us, he put down the paint canister.  He rested against the trunk of a marked tree and wiped his forehead with a sap-covered bandana.
The three of us tramped down from the road to meet him, feeling the whip of the low brush that we pushed aside as we descended. We greeted him with lunch leftovers and Collin told him about the spotted owl, dragged in but apparently not killed by Button, and about Button’s sudden sickness.
“Seems like the owl was poisoned or something,” Cooper offered.
“Geez,” Dad said.
The rangers talked on as Collin and I wandered off into the grove. Sunlight filtered through the shade of the cedars, and my sandals quickly filled with painful brush and razory dry stickers. Collin groused about how, thanks to Dad, the grove would be significantly thinned, turned hot and dusty. We paused by a thick-trunked cedar that bent towards the adjacent stream, and whose bark was marked with Dad’s red paint.
“Isn’t this tree a bit large for the chain saw?” Collin wondered aloud.

I heard more spoken word poetry in four days than I am ever likely to hear again in such a condensed period of time. Spoken word is exhausting and invigorating at the same time, and almost two weeks after the event it’s hard to form my thoughts into a coherent column.
In sports jargon, I guess you could say that Harvard’s preliminary bouts at College Unions Poetry Slam Invitational were intense—two of the teams we went up against in first rounds went on to finals. We challenged the audience with our poetry, we fought hard and practiced a lot, and after hearing a lot of emotional poems, the first-place title went to the well-deserving University of Texas-Austin. But in the end, CUPSI is so much more than a report of scores. I learned again and again how silly it is to slap numbers onto art.
So I’d like to share a poem with you. I wrote it as a way to collect my own thoughts about competitive poetry and human interaction over the four days our team spent in Boulder, Colo. It’s messy and meandering, but so are people. It’s tough to write poetry for performance—as soon as it’s out there, the goal of the poem becomes convincing listeners of your intent and your poetic skill rather than working through an idea in stanzas. So you can read this one to yourself. And no need score me on it.
 
 
Apology
 
I wrote a poem on the palm of my hand
But it washed off in the shower.

 
I think it had something to do with the recklessness I collected
From bus seat windows.
Somehow it had to do with itchy fabric seats.
It was about the spot of yogurt on the corner of your mouth,
The whitish blotch you cannot see.
It was about that, somehow.

 
Or maybe it had something to do with drinking a scorpion bowl
Collectively from colored straws
And not minding the sickly backwash
Because we were all going to get mono anyway.

 
I used to carry tiny plastic babies in my pockets,
I think because I liked the way they made my hands feel like mothers.
For once, I’m sure the poem on my palm had nothing to do with my mother.

 
I think the poem had something to do with camels
And how their fifth knee is located on their stomachs,
And of course it had something to do with the immortal jellyfish
Who is constantly aging and turning into a polyp of itself to be reborn
In the next deep-sea wave.

 
Somehow, everything I ever write on my palm is a fact about an animal,
Even email addresses I etch onto my skin are somehow stand-ins
For the regeneration of earthworms.
I can never seem to get any deeper than pen markings on palms—
Even here, on this plane, I can only speak in tidbits.
I want to tell you my hands are mothers
Even when they are hidden in my pockets, manufacturing sweat to rub off the
Mimicry of tattoos I am too afraid to truly carve into my baby pink placeholders.

 
Maybe if I tell you about my human heart and how it compares to the holy heart
Of a giraffe, then you will show me that your body is as basic as a giant squid.
Now that I think of it, that poem
Was probably about snowflakes and how they form their shapes
Based on unique microclimates they pass through
On their way down to this lonely earth.

 
In an airplane, ice crystals on the windows are examples of the beautiful imperfect.
All our bodies are on the outsides of airplane windows and yet
I have never held more than a plastic replica of an airplane in my hand.

 
I want to tell you that the reason my face is red
Is because it is a vestigial simulation of vulnerability—
There is no reason for me to display this color.
I am not sea coral.
I have no reason to announce my poisonous flesh.

 
I never wanted to write you into a poem
And maybe that’s why it got washed off in the shower.
I’m sorry if I’ve turned you into a regurgitated fact of my life.

Hopefully I have covered you with enough undetached rabbit parts 
That you will not pick up on the image of you I have scratched into my finger.

 
All bodies are perfect attempts at humanity, but I know yours
Was so much more painful to forge.

 
I could never talk clearly about attraction anyway.
I want to unironically call you a snowflake,
And maybe if I reduce you to an unmeltable marvel
This will give me permission to cradle you in my palms
To learn the microclimates that formed you,
Just as I want you to learn my unironic mother hands.

“The story could be summarized as a star-crossed love story,” Sam R. Moore ’15, producer for Lowell House Opera’s production of “Lakmé,” says. For an opera that explores the conflict that ensues when an Indian woman falls for a British soldier during England’s occupation of India, the description seems apt. For Moore, however, the label fails to entirely capture the opera, and during the show’s run from March 26 to April 5, the cast and production team hopes to create a more comprehensive image.
 
Stage director Roxanna K. Myhrum ’05 and music director Lidiya V. Yankovskaya work together to bring the story to life—a collaboration that allows for a fuller interpretation of the story, according to Yankovskaya. “You can interpret text in very different ways,” she says. “You can either choose to see what is actually there…or you can instill your blanket understanding.”
 
For Lowell House Opera, its production's appreciation of both the text and the culture makes the story shine. “What we’re trying to do is portray this setting authentically and these characters as real people instead of cultural stereotypes,” Moore says. Myhrum agrees: “We try to let the most powerful thing on stage be the emotions that the characters are grappling with, and those are the forces of love and hate.”
 
To cast the story and its characters as the focal point, the staff did extensive research to create accurate historical context. Myrhum says she read texts about Hinduism, worked with a movement consultant who understood the Bharatnatyam, and even researched a festival featured in the opera.
 
In addition to a historically accurate setting, the production hopes to reevaluate other key aspects of the show. Lakmé, played by Liv A. Redpath ’14 and Robin Farnsley—part of a double cast that allows collaboration between Harvard students and professionals—was interpreted differently compared to past renditions of the character. According to Moore, while earlier productions depict her as a victim, Lowell House Opera hopes to portray her as a strong character. “For me, I really see Lakmé as a young woman who is very colorful with the strength of her convictions,” Myhrum says.
 Despite the tweaks made, the production does not stray from the original text. Instead, it hopes to highlight the score and the complex story through singing and dance. “The challenge of this opera was to really find the passion and the action in all of the music,” Myhrum says. As Yankovskaya notes, through this, the cast and crew hope to bring attention to a neglected opera. “The music is beautiful, and it’s a shame the opera is not performed more often.”

Hoping to encourage a functional, friendly state in the Middle East, Western powers were once largely receptive to the image of Turkey as a model democracy, with Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan at the helm. Overlooked was Erdoğan’s disturbing tendency to crush his domestic opponents: hundreds of senior military officers who could have disrupted his rule were imprisoned, newspaper editors and journalists were detained frequently, and concerns about the treatment of minorities were largely dismissed.
Now those unnoticed concerns have come to the fore: Erdoğan, struggling to survive an anti-corruption inquiry that has already resulted in the resignations of three of his cabinet members and could cost his AKP party the next election, has taken the outrageous step of blocking Twitter across the entire country. This move comes after widespread sharing of leaked recordings, which allegedly feature Erdoğan instructing his son to hide vast sums of money.
“We will wipe out Twitter. I don’t care what the international community says,” the prime minister said at a campaign rally just hours before the ban went into effect. The prime minister also threatening to do the same to Facebook and YouTube unless they take up an “honest attitude.”
The prime minister’s government should not be allowed to suppress a news outlet, or especially an entire media platform, simply because it embarrasses him or his administration. Such a standard not only represents an unacceptable assault on the freedoms of speech and an unfettered press that are so essential to a democracy, but also could be easily exploited by the next Turkish government against Erdoğan and his allies. 
For a man who was once banned from holding public office and almost disallowed from running for prime minister because of his affiliation with banned Islamist parties, Erdoğan seems remarkably unaware of this disturbing drawback.
The Turkish authorities have responded to the criticisms of the White House, European Union, and press groups like the Committee to Protect Journalists with the assertion that the censorship is legal under Turkish law. While that may be true—the Turkish parliament passed a bill vastly expanding the government’s control over the Internet last month—any law that legitimates the suppression of free speech is corrosive to the free exchange of ideas that is so necessary for any democracy.
Until that overreach is corrected, Turkish-style democracy might not be much to aspire to.

Disney World, July 2003.
“Damn Arabs,” the man scoffed to his friend. I’m sure he wanted my family to hear. And we did. I clutched my mom’s arm a little tighter. I was 9 years old.

Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport, June 2006.
My father, brother, and I were randomly selected for screening upon our arrival. It was by the same officer who randomly selected us when we boarded the flight a week prior—I recognized the tattoo on his arm.
“Us again?” I said. I wanted him to hear.
“Khalas. Maa’lish,” my dad urged me in Arabic—“Enough. It’s okay.”
“It’s not okay,” I thought. “Enough.” I was 12 years old.

New York City Subway, April 2010.
“Everybody run! She probably has a bomb!”
This time, neither of my parents was there to protect me. His words stunned me, and I stood motionless. My heart raced as I endured the public humiliation. Tears rolled down my cheeks as bystanders comforted me. 
“Don’t pay any mind to that,” they assured me. “He’s just ignorant.” It was too late though; the damage was done. I could not unlive the experience. I was 15 years old.

I do not share these stories for pity. These moments are representative of the many experiences I’ve had whenever I’ve stepped out of my community in Dearborn, Mich.—home to the second-largest concentration of Arabs outside of the Middle East, most of whom are Muslim.
It is no surprise, then, that I had never planned to leave my snug community where my intentions and beliefs were seldom questioned or challenged—where the scarf wrapped around my head is not considered a barrier or a social impediment. This comfort keeps most of my community’s youth at bay.
Although uncommon in Dearborn, I left my hometown for college. And so, I find myself here. And here is great—I have yet to experience any racial or Islamophobic slurs during my time at Harvard.
Unexpectedly, though, a new challenge befell me upon my departure from home. I have struggled to navigate, establish, and articulate my identity. In Dearborn, neither my ethnicity, nor my religion, nor the hijab on my head were salient aspects of my identity. They were benign characteristics in the mass of other Arab-Muslim Americans. These traits did not define me back home; I never considered them as tumultuous features of my identity. I have had to struggle with the reality that here, they are.
When I walk into a room, I do not get to truly introduce myself as everyone else does. My appearance does it for me—my religion is made conspicuous to all, and, by extension, people form assumptions and judgments about my personal life and beliefs before I can afford to utter my name. They know my religion before they know that I’m wildly indecisive or idealistically optimistic or an obsessive planner. 
My hijab preconditions my identity now. And I am still adjusting to this idea.
When people ask where I’m from, my instinctive answer is “Michigan.”
They then clarify: “But where are you originally from?” 
“Well. My parents are from Lebanon, but I was born and raised here…” I reply. 
Do not misinterpret my response; I love, embrace, and identify with my heritage and religion. I am forever indebted to my homeland, its cedar trees, its power outages, and its open dirt fields where my siblings and I spent countless summer afternoons playing. But in the midst of Christmas tree decorating, Thanksgiving turkey carving, and responding in English to my parents’ Arabic, I have carried my American identity with the same weight as my Lebanese and Muslim identity. 
“Oh,” they often respond. This “oh” is often surprised, sometimes apologetic, and occasionally embarrassed. I never think to ask my friends where they are originally from, so I wondered why my headscarf alone was characteristic enough to make people initially assume that I am not from here. I’ve often been asked if I am an international student, as if no American could decide to wear a hijab. 
I began to question whether the American narrative has space to embrace my pluralistic identity.
It’s exhausting to have to fight to justify my American identity. It’s hard to feel that I am welcome here with so many instances of bigotry and racial slurs present in my memories. 
Even more, I hold a heavy burden of being representative of all Arabs and Muslims in the eyes of many. There are as many faces to Islam as there are Muslims and a spectrum of Arabs so diverse that even I blur particular traditions and dialects. In fact, many are shocked to learn that less than 20 percent of the world’s Muslims are in fact Arab. I cannot, nor do I wish to, be an archetype of all fellow Arabs and Muslims—it would be a disservice to them, and, moreover, simply inaccurate. I only wish to represent myself, with all my experiences, flaws, doubts, and dreams. 
I am Lebanese, American, Muslim, and much more. I am an accumulation of my experiences, whether it is spending blissful childhood summers in my homeland or enduring a defeating encounter on a subway. 
My identity has many faces—it is plural—and you could see that too. Just allow me to introduce myself.

Since my last column on the Crimean crisis, the plot has thickened considerably: from where National Geographic stands, the dangling Black Sea peninsula has joined the likes of Taiwan, Kashmir and Cyprus as an ‘Area of Special Status’. In terms of consequence to Eurasian politics and the U.S.-Russia bilateral relationship, Crimea has far outstripped Abkhazia or Transdniestria—marking the most glaring political geographic revision the Commonwealth of Independent States has seen since the end of the Cold War.
 
Over the course of a few weeks, it has become a lot easier to talk about Eurasian geopolitics in Cold War terms; Mitt Romney’s 2012 debate proclamations about Russia as grand rival have admittedly begun to sound much less unsound. But for the same reasons I identified two weeks ago, the Cold War paradigm has long ago met its maker. On the other hand, it is clear that attempts to neutralize Russia as a competing power, from Clinton-era shock therapy to the Obama-era reset, have been of little avail.
 
The truth lies somewhere in the middle, somewhat off the axis between Obama 2009 and Romney 2012: Russia is and will remain a Eurasian great power, deeply involved in its near abroad, and working with such a reality, the United States and Russia can identify issues of genuine common interest.
 
Opponents of this realist approach, which views power as the principal currency of international relations and does not, contrary to contemporary political dogma, amount to instinctive dovishness, cannot get past the imagined moral hazard. Putin’s impudence cannot go unpunished. If it has NATO member states in it, then let’s call it our neighborhood. We must act—rationally—in the face of chaotic irrationality.
 
This is the explicit, relentlessly moralistic language of the Republican and Democratic mainstreams and a vast majority of Ivy League elites, convinced that international order is something that can be precisely engineered, rather than merely managed. Seven months ago, it brought the Obama administration and Congress on the brink of war in Syria with no identifiable purpose and on the basis of trumped-up charges. Were it not for the president’s cautious bent and flagging marketing skills, the United States would be marking half a year of its third poorly-calibrated war in the Muslim world—hemorrhaging billions of dollars, political capital, and American lives. Any conservative or liberal worth his skin ought to know that he doesn’t want another Afghanistan or Iraq, especially as questions of strategic legacy have yielded to a debate over just how many trillions we wasted.
 
In the aftermath of Euromaidan and the Crimea takeover, it’s clear that American elites have missed the message once again. Harsh, face-saving responses are valued without accounting for the harm they pose to essential American interests; basic misunderstandings of culture, geography, and post-Cold War history has given rise to the hallucination that the West can determinedly outbid Russia in Ukraine. As is to be expected, they pick and choose revolutions (cloaking moral-ideological preferences under the guise of “vital interests”), forgetting that the Euromaidan movement overthrew an elected government vastly preferred by the people of Crimea and the Donbass. Russia’s response, while bold, is not an outburst—but rather, the logical equivalent of what the United States has done time and again in the Caribbean, the Persian Gulf, and Southeast Asia when it felt its interests threatened.
 
If any neoconservatives or more kindly-worded liberal internationalists think that maintaining the pretense of unipolar global policeman through force or monetary inducement is worth the incalculable, routinely higher-than-anticipated price tag, it is not worth arguing with them. If they can be made to understand American power as a complex machine with several engines, among them effective policy infrastructure and fiscal solvency, the temptation to bankrupt and embarrass America into absolute Good might be averted. Force is only the answer when it isn’t outweighed by blowback.
 
America’s foreign policy and national security interests are weighty and varied; as long as we remain the dominant power on the face of the earth, which is likely a while, it is only natural that we be concerned about many theaters. However, who holds sway in Kiev is not an overwhelmingly vital one, as it indeed is to Russia—and the rational response, however much engrained post-Cold War hubris it forces us to suppress, ought to take this into account. Most American voters (and Francis Fukuyama himself) have recovered from this nasty outgrowth of “end of history” thinking; it is time our political class gets with the program.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Harvard’s 2012 cheating scandal was a reminder that the motto “Veritas” does not ensure fair play. The draft Honor Code, proposed as part of a wider effort on the part of Dean Jay M. Harris and his Committee on Academic Integrity to support “intellectual discovery, artistic creation, independent scholarship, and meaningful collaboration,” seeks to rehabilitate truthfulness on campus. The list of “moral imperatives” will, the committee hopes, reinforce these educational virtues by “suffusing the culture of the place.” Beyond the specific issue of academic honesty, the code assumes that good values precede good deeds. But is this really true?
 
There are powerful incentives at Harvard that work against the code’s intentions. For undergraduates, the biggest carrots—or biggest sticks—are grades. 32 courses, 32 marks, distilled to a decimal point average. The mindset of GPA is second nature to young Americans, and a determinant of future success. If you want to get to Harvard, you need a near-flawless set of grades from high school—some candidates better a 4.0 with the help of AP scores. And even after Harvard, GPA is a key component in applications to professional careers and graduate programs. At each stage, years of academic endeavor boil down to a single number. It doesn’t matter what your GPA was last year, only what it is now.
 
With an eye on their ambitions and the grades needed to realize them, many undergraduates have to consider what they stand to lose by taking each course at Harvard, over and above what they might gain. Just listen to how students talk about GPA. Spend an afternoon in Harvard Yard and you are likely to overhear snatches of conversation such as, “That Ec class last semester really damaged my GPA,” or, “My 3.9 took a beating from the pre-med requirements.” It is possible—likely even—that a graduating senior’s GPA will be lower than a freshman’s after the latter’s first fall at Harvard, as a senior has endured the battleground of many more semesters. High GPAs require protection. When they get knocked, it hurts.
 
This metaphor of physical injury is familiar, but its familiarity should not obscure the fact that it is a strange way to think about assessment. Education can come to seem like a computer game where you lose lives rather than accumulate prizes. Feeling this way undermines the value of knowledge learned, work completed and challenges overcome.
 
GPA implicitly supports values that run counter to those in the proposed Honor Code. It discourages intellectual risk-taking and original thought. Students are rewarded for taking courses in which they are likely to do well and ones renowned for being easy. In some classes, syllabuses are comparable to contractual checklists spelling out how to get an A. At worst, sections abandon genuine inquiry and become performances for students to say what they believe teaching fellows want to hear.
 
The GPA system is further compromised by two different (and both reasonable) attitudes to grading among professors. Some argue that Harvard undergraduates perform well above the national average and deserve high marks to reflect this. Therefore, according to them, an A- is a truthful mean. Other faculty argue that this approach leads to grade inflation, which diminishes the value of a Harvard degree. Instead, they insist on using the full range of grades, which disadvantages students who might have scored better for the same level of performance in a different class. It is easy to see why professors who think “nationally” rather than “locally” are in the majority. They want to avoid queues at office hours, extra paperwork, and the responsibility of barring a student’s hopes of getting into medical school because of a single grade.
 
Those who think GPA works well might say that an average is an efficient way to summarize a list of grades. On graduation, a string of letters and their numerical mean amount to the same thing. This may be true, but the crucial problem with GPA is not the final result, but the dictating power it exerts in shaping an individual’s decisions and dissuading admirable attitudes to learning as he or she works toward a degree.
 
Although it is hard to imagine how GPA could be done away with, there are certainly ways to curb its sway. Harvard could increase un-assessed, ungraded discussion time, in the model of Oxford and Cambridge supervisions. This would help facilitate greater experimentation and heartfelt contribution while discouraging irrelevant participation to check-off course requirements. The College could also learn from the graduate school by prioritizing projects and longer papers, which develop through an advising relationship with a TF. To make time for this initiative, classes could assign fewer quizzes and thought-papers. And perhaps the College could encourage undergraduates to take more than two courses pass/fail. If the standards for passing were more rigorous, people might not see the ungraded route as a way to take the course less seriously.
 
The Honor Code’s inauguration is an ideal opportunity for Harvard to use its reputation to open a national discussion about whether the GPA system makes practical and moral sense. Does a 4.0 bear convincing correlation with whether an individual has devoted him or herself to the discovery, creation and collaboration the code celebrates? Harvard’s approach to GPA must better enable students to square their ambitions with these educational values.

Though Harvard Square is already a popular tourist attraction, local businesses are working to bring in even more visitors, particularly targeting Chinese travelers.
 
The Harvard Square Business Association recently partnered with the company Attract China to reach out to Chinese visitors, according to HSBA Executive Director Denise A. Jillson. With the company’s help, HSBA and businesses in the Square will advertise to Chinese tourists with a website in Mandarin.
 
“It’s critical to the economic vitality of the Square, there’s no doubt about it,” Jillson said. “That’s why we thought given the number of tour groups coming in, increasing every year, and the number of Asian tourists that are arriving, it seemed prudent and even necessary.”
 
Set to launch in April, this online portal will feature various restaurants, retailers, and other attractions in Cambridge and the greater Boston area. The organization has teamed up with more than 70 individual companies to provide information in Mandarin about popular destinations.
 
Founded in 2011, Attract China partners with businesses to assist them in contacting and establishing a presence with Chinese tourists. The company operates a Mandarin website called Xiao Yao Dao, which translates to “the gateway to getaway,” through which Chinese tourists can learn about hotels, casinos, museums, and events in a variety of destinations.
 
According to Evan Saunders, CEO and Co-Founder of Attract China, he first thought of the idea for the website in Beijing, where he says he “got really in touch with the Chinese traveler.” 
 
Today, Saunders said, the company aims to help tourists get the full experience when they travel to places like Harvard Square. They target both individual travelers as well as Chinese students already studying in the U.S.
 
“Harvard Square plays integral role as it’s very visited by Chinese tourists," Saunders said. "There are fantastic shops and activities to do here.”
 
According to Jillson, although tourism from China already plays an important role in the local economy, recent changes in the way that U.S. visas are processed helped spur the decision to work with Attract China.
 
According to the website of the United States Embassy in Beijing, the U.S. established a new streamlined visa process last year. But Jillson said that this is not the only reason that Square businesses are looking to China.
 
“The number of Asian tourists here in the Square is increasing every year,” Jillson said. “This will be the first time that we’ve done this with a particular website. We haven’t reached out specifically to any other populations.”
 
For Daniel Berger-Jones, president of Cambridge Historical Tours, Chinese tourism also represents an appealing business opportunity for several reasons.
 
“The demand is ever increasing, just by nature of the fact that the Chinese market is opening up, [with] more direct flights,” Berger-Jones said. “It’s only going to grow. That’s why everybody is excited that Attract China is looking at Harvard Square.”
 
Eight tours have been led in Chinese so far by tour guides fluent in Mandarin, according to Berger-Jones. Although most American groups like tours that emphasize personal narratives, Cambridge Historical Tours has tailored their tours to Chinese groups’ specific preferences.
 
“We came up with a completely different tour that focuses more on superlatives,” Berger-Jones said. “What the groups tend to want is a really nice photo in as many places as humanly possible.”
 
However, Berger-Jones also said that there have been some difficulties in trying to bridge the culture gap, including consumer behavior and miscommunication.
 
“In China, when you’re given a price, it is always negotiable. We’re not used to that,” he said, also noting difficulties created by the language barrier.
 
Despite these difficulties, Cambridge Historical Tours is not the only company working to accommodate the growing number of Chinese tourists.
 
“We try to translate some of our different marketing materials into different languages, including Chinese,” said Ryley Reynolds ’15, president of Harvard Student Agencies.
 
Additionally, HSA sells a crimson t-shirt with a Chinese character that means Harvard.
 
“It’s pretty popular among tourists and students,” Reynolds said.

UPDATED: March 26, 2014, at 1:00 a.m.
In preparation for its reopening this fall, the Harvard Art Museums will create a student advisory board composed of graduate and undergraduate students to serve as its connection to the student body.
The board, which will meet monthly beginning at the end of this semester, is one of many initiatives the newly consolidated museums will roll out to reinstate their presence on campus and increase student participation in coming months before the November reopening. Specifically, the board will publicize Harvard Art Museums events and help disseminate knowledge about the museums broadly throughout the Harvard student population.
Jessica L. Martinez, the director of Academic and Public Programs at the Harvard Art Museums, said the museums are particularly interested in hearing about student life. The division supports students and faculty through teaching and learning opportunities, and also plans a range of programs for both members of the Harvard community and the public.
Martinez said that the student board and other outreach initiatives aim to capture the energy of the student body to create something of a start-up atmosphere in the museums.
For students, many of whom have never been inside the museums’ flagship facility on Quincy Street, which closed in 2008, the initiatives offer a way to interact with the museums not previously available.
“It’s hard to participate any less at this moment,” said Isaac C. Dayno ’15, a history of art and architecture concentrator, who participated in the focus groups in the fall of 2013 that brainstormed what students would like to see at the museums’ opening.
“The opening of the museums will be a total paradigm shift in student participation,” Dayno said, reflecting on what he said was inaccessibility of the collection on campus. Since the closure of the Fogg Museum in 2008, students have had access to view the collections off-site, but the newly renovated and expanded building will create a place for students, faculty, and the public to encounter some of the more than 250,000 pieces owned by the museums.
Along with the student board, the Harvard Art Museums will initiate other programs to encourage education through the collections. One such program will train Harvard undergraduates to give tours of the museums to friends, colleagues, and public audiences.
The museums will also train graduate students, primarily history of art and architecture students and students from the Graduate School of Education, to teach school groups in the renovated facility using objects from the collections. The graduate students trained through the program will work closely with teachers from Cambridge Rindge and Latin School on developing art education.

Six weeks after the death of teammate Angela R. Mathew ’15 in a car accident, the Harvard Mock Trial team has qualified for the national championship tournament.
Harvard Mock Trial sent the minimum number of participants to last weekend’s opening round championship series, opting to compete with six team members rather than replacing Mathew, who died in a traffic accident after a February competition.
The weekend in Greenville, S.C. was difficult, team members said. They said they struggled to replace Mathew’s award-winning ability on the witness stand and could not keep her off their minds as they discussed a case involving a fictional death. When Harvard's qualification for the national championship tournament was announced, teams from across the country stood up to recognize the group’s accomplishment.
Harvard will now advance to the final tournament of the American Mock Trial Association’s annual competition with 47 of the country’s best teams.
“It’s kind of surreal to think that we’ve gone from what was unquestionably the worst night of our lives to a really happy moment,” co-captain J. Zachary Fields ’15 said.
The team discussed the group’s future soon after co-captain Florence Y. Chen ’15 and Graham J. Wyatt ’14 were discharged from the hospital. They met with team members Fields, Kristina L. Tester ’14, Neil N. Alacha ’16, and Gene Y. Chang ’17 as a group and ultimately decided not to replace Mathew.
“We decided collectively that we wanted to continue competing for Angela without adding anyone new to our team,” Wyatt wrote in an email.
According to members, competing with the minimum number of people allowed by official rules was challenging, and not only because of the extra work.
“None of us could portray Angela’s uniquely funny, touching, and engaging characters in quite the way she could,” Chen wrote in an email.
“Angela was hands-down one of the best witnesses in the country,” Fields added.
Alacha said that modifications to the case after the regional competition made the process more difficult. While the case originally involved only theft and armed robbery, the American Mock Trial Association changed one of the armed robbery charges to felony murder.
“The element of a death in the case—that our statements and witnesses now [had] to talk about and make real through our presentation—was hard for me to grapple with at first, and was a bit triggering for me,” Alacha wrote in an email.
Alacha, who played the same role as Angela had played previously, said he thought of her most while awaiting his turn to take the stand.
“At previous tournaments, we would always sit next to each other, and she would discreetly squeeze my arm whenever something ridiculous happened in the trial—which was quite often—to prevent herself from laughing,” Alacha wrote. “That would only make me start to giggle, and a few times we received glares from judges.”
“I missed that squeeze very much last weekend,” he added.
Throughout the weekend, team members appreciated the national mock trial community’s “incredible” support, Wyatt said.
“They had a beautiful moment of silence for her, assembled a book of written memories of Angela competing, [were] incredibly accommodating, sent us countless well-wishes and words of encouragement, and cheered for us all the way through the weekend," Wyatt said.
Some competitors went so far as to tell Fields that they would like to see Harvard advance, even if it meant their own teams were eliminated.
Fields said that he was also struck by tournament attendees' standing when Harvard advanced to Nationals.
“It was kind of like Tom Brady cheering on Peyton Manning,” Fields said. “It was strange, but it meant a lot.”
In two weeks, the team will head to Orlando, Fla., for the national competition.
According to Chen, Harvard has almost always placed in the top five but has never clinched the championship.
“If Angela were here right now, she’d be yelling at us, ‘You have to win!’” Fields said.
Wyatt said that competing for Mathew means a lot to the team, regardless of the outcome.
“It’s been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life, and there’s nothing more worthy to be fighting for than her."

UPDATED: March 27, 2014, at 8:27 p.m.
In the coming months, two recent Harvard College graduates will fill supermarket shelves with food that is more nutritious, uses 2,000 times less water, and emits less greenhouse gas than traditional livestock. Opting for the pair’s food products over other alternatives may seem like an easy decision, but the obstacle they face is largely social: after all, their miracle ingredients are insects.
 
With the aim of introducing insects into Western society as a healthy and sustainable ingredient to replace the use of staples such as ground beef and other products, Laura E. D’Asaro ’13, Meryl F. Natow '13, and Rose Wang ’13 founded Six Foods last fall through the Harvard Innovation Lab’s Venture Incubation Program. The team’s insect-based food products were designed with the help of Geoff Lukas, the chef de cuisine at Sofra Bakery, a Middle Eastern restaurant in Cambridge.
The former roommates said they discovered the prevalence and benefits of eating insects during separate trips abroad in Africa and Asia during their undergraduate careers.
 
“When we came back from our trips, we were blown away by the potential that insects have,” Wang said.
D’Asaro said that because insects are small, cold-blooded animals, the amount of water needed to sustain enough insects for a pound of insect meat is only one to two gallons. The amount of water needed for an equivalent pound of beef, on the other hand, can be as high as 2,000 gallons. Wang added that insects are low in fat and high in nutrients, with more iron than other sources of meat.
There is also huge potential for urban insect farming, as it takes little space and few resources, D’Asaro added. She said that insect farming is especially opportune for post-industrial cities looking to revitalize their large, empty buildings.
However, bringing bugs to American dinner tables is notoriously difficult, with Western society’s general repugnance to the idea and the many challenges faced by any entrepreneurial endeavor.
D’Asaro and Wang said that the mentorship through the i-Lab was instrumental in overcoming those hurdles.
 
After pitching their idea to a group of entrepreneurs, Six Foods was accepted last fall into the Venture Incubation Program, in which teams share their ideas and get feedback from industry specialists and experts. Teams also receive a mentor for long-term guidance that continues after the startup leaves the 100-day program.
“Any entrepreneurial experience is very intense,” said Phillipe Taieb, a social entrepreneurship consultant who serves as the mentor for Six Foods. “There are other things that recent graduates can do that are much less risky, and it takes a personal dynamism that Rose and Laura have.”
Six Foods plans to introduce chocolate chip cookies and chips made with flour from roasted crickets as their first product for mass consumption.
“For these food products, a good taste was immediately there, but to get across the psychological hurdle of eating insects, we had to take away some of the factors that scare people,” Wang said.
According to Taieb, starting with snack foods allowed the start-up to fulfill another goal as well: to prevent their insect-based foodstuffs from serving only niche consumer groups interested in environmentally sustainable products.
 
“From the get-go, they did not want to limit themselves and wanted a large segment of the population to approach their product,” Taieb said.
Taieb said that Six Foods’ cookies and chips will be in Boston-area supermarkets in about three months. Wang and D’Asaro added that their primary focus now is launching a Kickstarter crowdsourcing effort at the end of April, but they are already looking to develop urban insect farms across the country and testing foods made with actual insect meat.
“They are extraordinary individuals with an energy that makes them very good at getting support from many people,” Taieb said. “There is a lot of goodwill out there for their innovative goal.”

The Department of Romance Languages and Literatures is planning to redesign its curriculum to attract concentrators and non-concentrators to high-level language courses which have seen a sharp decline in undergraduate enrollment in recent years, according to chair Virginie Greene.
Greene said that the department is exploring a variety of approaches, such as better communicating the value of its courses to students and introducing more courses for non-concentrators, to make the department appear more relevant to students. She added that the department is considering altering the name of its undergraduate concentration, which is currently called Romance Languages and Literatures.
College students want to know the practical value of their courses, according to Catherine Downey, coordinator of undergraduate programs for the department.
“Students might not necessarily know Romance languages and literatures. What do you do with that? What does that mean? I think we are trying to bring it back to the basics,” she said. “What can you do with that concentration?”
Director of Undergraduate Studies Luis G. Negron argued that the study of Romance languages enables students to pursue a range of activities in cultures outside of the United States, from working on health initiative in Peru to studying student movements in France. The department currently teaches courses in French, Spanish, Portuguese, Catalan, and Italian.
To show students the range of opportunities that can accompany a Romance Languages and Literatures degree, Downey said that the department is working to contact and understand the career paths of its alumni.
In addition to conveying the relevance of its courses to draw in more enrollees, the department also hopes to ease language requirements to attract more students to upper-level courses specifically.
“We should offer more courses in English to attract students who don’t feel that they are at the linguistic level to take advanced courses in the culture, the literature, the films...but would be very interested in our topics,” Greene said.
Offering courses in English about Romance cultures often motivates students to learn the language of the works they are studying, Negron added.
The department has not yet finalized the direction it will take to institute changes to course structure, but Greene said that she hopes that changes will be made in the next few years.
“Maybe [the changes] will be done progressively. I am not sure how it will be done,” she said.
Before making changes, the department will issue a survey to students currently enrolled in department courses to measure their effectiveness, Romance Languages and Literatures preceptor Nicole A. Mills said.
Mills said that the results of this survey will be presented in a symposium featuring many experts from Harvard and other universities across the country in October. The findings of the survey will inform the steps that the department will take in coming years.
 
The survey will launch on April 1 and remain open through April 15.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former officials from different branches of the federal government advocated for structural reforms within Congress and greater public participation in the political process to relieve political gridlock at an event hosted by the Bipartisan Policy Center’s Commission on Political Reform Wednesday afternoon at the Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum.
The event was part of a series of “National Conversations on American Unity” sponsored by the BPC in partnership with USA Today held across the country. It consisted of two panels on Congressional reform.
The first panel, chaired by Harvard Institute of Politics Director C.M. Trey Grayson ’94, was made up of officials from past presidential administrations who discussed the process of confirming presidential appointments and the confirmation process’s role in Congressional gridlock.
“There is no question that the appointment process is broken and takes too long,” Grayson said.
 
Andrew H. Card, chief of staff under President George W. Bush, added that the fact that appointments requiring Senate confirmation number in the thousands compounds the problem.
Panelists concurred that a close relationship between the White House and Congress is crucial to relieving gridlock.
“A President who is willing to engage Congress can change the world,” said John H. Sununu, former governor of New Hampshire and chief of staff under President George H. W. Bush. He added that President Obama could do a lot more to strengthen relations with legislators.
Former U.S. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott noted that discord between the two houses of Congress also contributes to the gridlock.
“The Senate and the House of Representatives today are like two ships passing in the night,” Lott said. “People need to put their positions on the line and lead aggressively to get a result,” rather than being preoccupied with reelection.
The event’s second panel, consisting mostly of former members of Congress, also noted that the President has a responsibility to improve relations with legislators, while mentioning other factors that contribute to partisanship.
Some panel members noted that today’s hyper-partisan political atmosphere is not conducive to increased civility among legislators, for whom association with the other party is risky.
“A picture with the President could cost some representatives the primary,” former Texas Congressman Charles A. Gonzalez said.
Gerrymandering is also still a rampant problem, according to members of the panel, who agreed that independent redistricting committees would increase the number of competitive House seats and placate extreme political positions.
The panel also discussed introducing two-year budget deals instead of the typical one-year deal so that the budget would not be debated during election years. It also touched on reforming campaign finance in light of the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision and enticing legislators to spend more time in Washington, D.C.
Both panels concluded by emphasizing the significance of public participation in the political process, particularly by young people.
 
“We need a whole new generation thinking about the issues that matter to us all,” said former U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe, of Maine.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Playing in just her second Ancient Eight game ever, then-freshman guard Christine Clark caught a pass from senior guard Brogan Berry, drove into the lane, and pulled up for a jumper with four seconds to go. One defensive stand later, and the women’s basketball team survived a road test at Columbia, 69-68.
Fast forward three years. Similar situation, different personnel—of that original starting lineup, only Clark remained.
Up against Iona in the first round of the WNIT, Clark had not had a great night offensively. Stymied by Gaels guard Joy Adams—a defender that Delaney-Smith termed “more athletic than Clarkie, not something you usually see”—the senior was shooting at 29 percent, well under her usual field goal percentage, which hovered just below 40 percent on the season.
Almost every other starter on the women’s basketball team had had a more successful night finding the basket, but trailing by one against Iona with the postseason run on the line, Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith made the call. Clark was to get the ball, drive down the court, and find a spot to pull up and shoot—all in the span of six seconds—to win the game for the Crimson.
The co-captain did one better. She grabbed the inbounds pass, snaked her way down the court, and—seemingly without effort—tossed in an uncontested layup. Off of Clark’s shot, Harvard moved on to the second round of the WNIT for the third-straight year.
Maybe it would be surprising, that Delaney-Smith had chosen to give Clark the last-second possession, or that Clark would come up with the game-winner after being bottled up by Adams, given her relatively lackluster performance all night. But for anyone who has followed the senior through her career in a Harvard uniform, none of the heroics were surprising.
From the time she stepped onto the court as a rookie, Clark has been an offensive force to be reckoned with. A four-year starter, the Tucson, Ariz. native has contributed in the double-digits each season, and from her sophomore year onwards has led the Crimson in scoring.
But especially during her final campaign, Clark contributed far more than her average 16.7 points per game. There were questions coming into the 2013-2014 season as to whether Harvard would be able to replace recently-graduated forward Victoria Lippert, who spearheaded the offense alongside Clark.
But the senior turned from an individual—who had always excelled at creating her own shot but would force up an errant shot after drawing a double or triple team—to a captain, one who created shots for teammates, led pregame shoot-arounds, motivated her team in huddles, and still somehow managed to increase her own offensive output.
With the loss to Rutgers in the second round on Monday night, Clark’s basketball career—at least with Harvard, as the senior will endeavor to play overseas—is over. It has been a decorated career for the three-time All-Ivy first team honoree, who is now No. 4 on the all-time Harvard scoring list.
In fact, if the senior can name one of the few disappointments of her career, it’s likely the lack of an Ancient Eight title. Back-to-back losses to Penn and Princeton at home made it nearly impossible for the Crimson to re-claim the top spot, and after watching the Tigers take the championship for the previous three years, Harvard saw the title go to the other Killer P this season.
But in Clark’s four years playing in Lavietes Pavilion, the Crimson has accomplished nearly everything short of the elusive title. In Clark’s sophomore season, Harvard became the first Ivy League team to win a game in the WNIT—a trend the squad has since continued—and this year, the Crimson received an at-large bid to the tournament, another Ancient Eight first.
Without the senior, the team likely would not have even received that bid. Paced by Clark’s 25 points, Harvard pulled out a victory against Princeton in the teams’ first matchup, defeating the Tigers at Jadwin for the first time since 2009. That win kept the Crimson undefeated in Ivy play and catapulted the women atop the league until Princeton-Penn weekend rolled around again.  So while Clark’s last-second layup against Iona was perhaps not wholly expected, it was almost fitting that it was the captain who ensured that the seniors had another game in their future.
Of course, Harvard will miss something from every one of its seniors—guard Jasmine Evans’ speed and sharp-shooting abilities, guard Melissa Mullins’ defensive grit and rebounding skills, and center Elise Gordon’s presence in the post.
And, just as Harvard adjusted following the loss of Lippert, Delaney-Smith will work her magic and manage to fill the hole left by Clark. Sophomore guard Kit Metoyer, with her dangerously accurate shots from an NBA-three-point distance and game face that eerily resembles Clark’s, will probably be slotted to fill the shooting guard role. Junior forwards Erin McDonnell and Temi Fagbenle have both had outstanding finishes to their seasons and will look to pick up the slack on the scoring end of the floor.
But regardless of however Delaney-Smith pulls together another team that will—considering the coach’s track record—in all likelihood, contend for an Ivy League Championship, there’s no denying the fact that when the 2014-2015 season rolls around, No. 22 will be missed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In one of my most vivid childhood memories, I am climbing the stairs to my Grand Rapids, Mich. bedroom, crying because my beloved Michigan State Spartans were trailing at halftime of their Sweet Sixteen game against Syracuse. I was certain that, if I wasn’t in front of the television, there was no way Mateen Cleaves and Morris Peterson could reverse the deficit. What, were they supposed to do it on their own? They needed me, and parental tyranny was about to derail their season. In the end, the anecdotal evidence bore me out—my parents grabbed me out of bed in the midst of the Spartans’ game-ending 22-2 run that carried them over the Orangemen, and the team ultimately went on to win the 2000 national championship.
In one of my most vivid college memories, I am dressed in a red bodysuit in the student section at Lavietes Pavilion (a time before I was confined by the bounds of journalistic objectivity). Then-junior forward Kyle Casey catches the ball at the baseline in front of us, pump fakes, drives, and humiliates Princeton right down to the Slavic Languages department with a one-handed, and-one dunk. A bunch of Crimson-hued stomping later, and the students are charging the court at Lavietes Pavilion, celebrating Harvard’s first Ivy League title since whenever-it-was.
When this year’s brackets came out on Selection Sunday, I wasn’t particularly thrilled—I had been dreaming of following the Harvard team to a San Diego beach getaway, and Spokane was just in front of Gary, Ind., on my list of basketball-watching destinations. Then, in the same group of four teams, I saw that the Spartans were also traveling to eastern Washington to play Delaware. Well, at least I’ll get to see State, I thought.
Then Harvard beat Cincinnati, the Spartans took care of business against Delaware, and well…we had Harvard-Michigan State. The lead-up to the game was a personal thrill for me. One of my co-writers noted that I was beaming after I asked Spartans coach Tom Izzo, who might as well have been President of Earth for much of my life, questions at the pregame media conference. And about Harvard, no less! I resisted the urge to reveal my Michigan roots, even after Izzo made a reference to “our neck of the woods.” There were journalistic standards to maintain, after all.
But for a moment, let’s enter the theoretical, unthinkable world where those standards don’t exist. The matchup between these two teams was a prospect I had been asked about since entering college, discussing respective hometown loyalties with my sports-minded friends. “Who do you take in the tournament, Harvard or Kentucky-Michigan State-Duke? You can’t go against your school; you go to Harvard.”
I didn’t know where I would stand—remember the crying—but I was also pretty certain it wouldn’t matter. This was the legendary Tom Izzo and Michigan State we were dealing with; they don’t really do upsets. The man has brought his teams to six Final Fours in 12 seasons. For the Spartan fan, excitement in March was an inevitability, not a privilege—if Kansas and Louisville could do nothing about it, Harvard certainly couldn’t. This was a bit of armor to protect me from the question. Harvard or Michigan State? There’s one possible outcome; it doesn’t make a difference.
The first half of the game did nothing to prove me wrong. The Crimson was the Tune Squad playing the Monstars. If a Harvard fan closed his eyes in a moment of despair, there was a good chance he was missing a Branden Dawson dunk. Even the famously grouchy Izzo looked at ease as his team took a 12-point lead into halftime. Having your worldview confirmed is comforting.
The second half was the most bizarre 20 minutes of my life as a sports fan, not least because I literally had a front row seat for all of it.
The period opened much the way it had closed, with a Spartan dunk, this one a monstrous tip slam by Adreian Payne. But then there was a Harvard huddle during a timeout early in the second half, punctuated throughout by the shrill bark of the hyper-intense sophomore point Siyani Chambers. I couldn’t quite make out any of the words—not that I really needed to. The tone said all there was to be said about “not going out this way,” “we’re better than this,” etc. A little too late, I thought, but hey, at least there’s no quit in Cambridge.
Out of the timeout, Harvard couldn’t stop scoring, and Michigan State couldn’t stop turning the ball over. Co-captain Brandyn Curry knocked down a couple of threes. Junior forward Steve Moundou-Missi dunked right in Denzel Valentine’s face. Junior wing Wesley Saunders pulled the classic older brother move of stealing a backcourt pass—one employed in the first half by Michigan State’s Gary Harris—for an easy lay-in.
It refused to stop. And when a cross-court pass just cleared the outstretched hand of a lunging Spartan defender and found Laurent Rivard in the corner, now totally unguarded after making a cumulative two feet of space for himself all game, all I could muster was an “Oh my God…” and a laugh of disbelief. Harvard was winning, and Michigan State was losing. Your brain comes up with some pretty kooky acrobatics when someone tosses a grenade right into the middle of its worldview.
Ultimately, the Rivard three was as good as it would get for Harvard. On the next possession, Michigan State’s Travis Trice buried a three of his own—with a “calm down, we got this” gesture to his teammates—and the Crimson never led again. Harris hit a three, Valentine hit a three, a Saunders lay-up spun out, and just like that, it was over. I felt like I had just spent an hour in a laundry machine.
It was hard to really say what I had felt—a basketball game is zero-sum, with one winner and one loser. Yet I distinctly recall a sensation of pulling for two teams at once, that one team’s success somehow did not detract from the other team’s. This crazy game had redefined mathematics for me.
The texts from home started cropping up on my phone during Harvard’s run—“The Harvard dogs came to play,” “Unreal,” “Who the hell is your radio announcer?” This was undeniably cool. In West Michigan, Harvard is not a topic at the forefront of people’s minds (“they’re pretty liberal out there, right?”). Real or imagined, I have always felt like my college choice created some separation between my hometown and me—something I suspect is true for a lot of people that didn’t come here from East Coast prep schools. Harvard basketball, now mounting a serious challenge to the eminently respected institution of Michigan State basketball, was bridging that gap. Grand Rapids had no choice but to connect with Harvard.
This game did not prove, as one of our former beat writers wistfully asserted, that Harvard could be a big-time sports school; I grew up around big-time sports schools, and I am not delusional enough to believe that. But what it may have done, for a few hours, is make Harvard a little more relatable to the rest of the country.
In the end, I am happy that Michigan State gets a shot at another Final Four, and I am happy that Harvard showed it was more than a Wall Street breeding ground. If kicked around, it could kick back. And I hope everyone who watched the game takes away the same feeling I saw on display in the postgame handshake line, with the future NBA stars taking a couple of extra moments to talk to their dispatched combatants: mutual respect.

At Harvard, there’s a weird mix of geeks, bros, hipsters, and people who never left the 1960’s. Walk out of the Yard, and it gets even stranger. In Flyby’s ever-scientific observation of human behavior, we’ve discovered a new epicenter of oddity: Dunkin’ Donuts. Here are a few gems from the Bow and JFK Street Dunkin' Donuts locations.A very young looking male college student.“My mom would kill me if she knew I was drinking coffee now.” Yeah, imagine what that caffeine is going to do come bedtime! 9:30 isn’t that far off…A very elderly man to a young mother getting coffee with her daughter.“My mother was a redhead with a high forehead too. You’re very beautiful.”The most disconcerting part about this was that there were two other men in the store who both paid the woman very similar compliments about a minute later. I guess they weren’t going to be eliminated as suitors without a fight.A frazzled engineering concentrator? Someone taking 5 classes this semester? No. A high school student.“Man, I don’t even know how I’d get through class without my Dunks…”College is going to suck for you, my friend.Middle-aged man with a super red face, about a minute after ordering an iced coffee.“I DIDN’T ASK FOR ICED COFFEE, I ASKED FOR HOT COFFEE!! IS IT THAT HARD?!”Hmm.Moral of the story: hilarity is everywhere. Next time you go to a Dunkin’ Donuts (or really anywhere in public around here), perk up your ears and try to catch something ridiculous. Pay extra attention to men with mustaches, groups of high school students, anyone wearing fraternity or sorority clothing, and anyone who is ever having a conversation on their cell phone as they order.

Happy Wednesday! As if you aren’t already bothered by the fact that it’s only Wednesday, here are some conversations you’ve probably had this week that have sufficiently annoyed you:
1) “Hey, what’s up? How was your spring break?”: You didn’t mind telling your best friends what you did over break, but when every single conversation you have with people in the d-hall or as you walk to class begins with this question, you’re probably wondering by now if it’s socially acceptable to just stare them down and not reply.
2) “Dad and I miss you already! We wish you were back again!”: You liked being home for approximately somewhere between 24 to 48 hours, and then you realized you miss not having someone reprimand you for staying in bed all weekend binge-watching your favorite TV series.
3) “Now let’s talk about that midterm/paper you have next week…”: It’s hard enough disciplining yourself to get up for class (or at least getting up to snooze your alarm), but you already have something big due in your class while your brain is too preoccupied wondering when you’ll stop being in Spring Break mode.
4) “Not to stress you out, but do you know what you’re doing this summer yet?”: Thanks for prefacing that question, but that doesn’t stop you from refreshing your email every 2 minutes for a reply from that internship you applied to many months ago. It also doesn’t stop you from considering burning your resume and cover letter and blowing off your summer somewhere sunny and tropical.
 
IN THE ATMOSPHEREIt may be nearly April, but apparently no one told the weather that because it’s going to snow today! With a high of 37 degrees, there’s an “East Coast blizzard alert”. Basically we should all cross our fingers for a snowday (and then be sorely disappointed).

After a week of R&R, we have returned to campus, (hopefully) rested and eager to finish the rest of the semester off right. Here are six realizations I made upon my chilly arrival back in Cambridge:
 Don’t take a Sunday night red eye, arriving in Logan at 6:15 A.M Monday morning. This will be an extremely depressing experience. Definitely avoid this if you’re coming from a warm climate. Boarding the flight in San Francisco in leggings and a t-shirt and being greeted by sixteen degree weather in Boston was not pleasant. Pro tip: if you absolutely must take a red-eye, remember your room key! It was no fun squatting in the hallway outside my door for hours as I waited for my roommates to wake up. It was even less fun heading to my 10 A.M. right after this.
 
Spring cleaning needs to happen, but I can’t imagine where to begin. With the collection of Diet Cokes, Starbucks cups, and Pinkberry containers that cover my desk (okay,  this is gross)? The random papers, bits of trash and packaging, and clothes all over our floor? The three pillows in the hallway that no one will claim? The knocked over drying rack in the common room? At this point, I’m not even sure I’ll bother to fully unpack… it’s much easier just rifling through a mound of clothes at the foot of my bed every morning. I remember my housing application from last year: “I am extremely organized and can’t imagine living with someone messy. I absolutely need neat roommates who also want a clean room.”
 
Midterms round II are always closer than you think. This is the time to bring up those grades! If only we weren’t still recovering from the last set of midterms and struggling to regain a work ethic after one week without reading, papers, and psets. Hmm… maybe I should’ve done a little work over break.
 
Or maybe I should’ve found something to do this summer. Hopefully an amazing job or internship will turn up randomly. That’s what often happens, right?
 
Wow, winter really is endless. Here we are with only five weeks of classes left and a snowstorm coming in today. Did I really need to bring back a suitcase of “spring” clothing? I thought there were seasons in New England…. Didn’t realize the climate was perpetual winter.
 
Wait… five weeks of classes left?! Not really sure how this is possible, but I definitely haven’t had a chance to cross everything off my freshmen year bucket list. Time to cram all expectations and hopes for college into this last stretch!
