After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The idea of “home” is one that is easy to take for granted—a place of consistency and security that remains the same no matter how life changes otherwise. However, for many, taking home for granted is not an option; the question “What is home?” requires more reflection. This question was the theme of the show “House, Home”in the Student Organization Center at Hilles (SOCH) last Thursday. In this exhibition, the concepts of home and domesticity were examined through the artwork of Harvard students and Boston’s homeless or formerly homeless artists.
“House, Home” displayed work from 23 student artists and 12 artists from St. Francis House, the largest day shelter in New England. St. Francis offers an open access art studio, complete with paints, plasters, and even Saori looms for weaving—all part of their Expressive Therapy Program. According to the shelter website, the Margaret Stewart Lindsay Art Studio at St. Francis House serves between 25 and 30 people a day, five days a week, every week of the year. Linda E. Dolph, an art therapist from St. Francis House, spoke at the Thursday event about the importance of the art studio to the shelter’s therapy programs. The proceeds from the sales of student artwork at the SOCH went directly to the Massachusetts Housing and Shelter Alliance, while the profits of sales for St. Francis House art went directly to the artists.
“House, Home,” curated by Kristen L. Cronon ’12, included a mixture of photography, painting, drawing, film, and other media. Cronon said of her inspiration for the show: “My work at the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter is part of [why] I reflect on what makes something a home. What are the resources and people you [depend] on when you don’t have a physical home to create that sense of groundedness.” In this vein, Cronon selected pieces that felt personal and specific to the artist.
“House, Home” was displayed with impeccable design, thanks to the efforts of Cronon and Qichen Zhang ’12, who were in charge of arranging the evening’s exhibit. The SOCH Penthouse’s floor-to-ceiling windows were a clean, black background for the suspended frames of artwork. Tthe window panes lent the gallery a simple, minimalist feel and threw the art itself into sharp focus.
The artwork was arranged not by artist or subject, but in groups that best juxtaposed the works. The juxtaposition of “In the Closet” by Loretta Jarak, a St. Francis House artist, and “2511” by Caroline M. Cuse ’15 challenged the conventional definition of home. “2511” was a photograph of the boxy, unwelcoming white exterior of a home with small windows and a gravel yard, while “In the Closet,” an abstract painting with no distinct structures, contained only two human figures.
Also present at the show last Thursday was guest of St. Francis House and painter Efon D. Elad. At “House, Home” Elad exhibited a painting called “The pass by the city lake,” a colorful depiction of a car on a street carved into the rock of a hillside overlooking a city and a lake. Reflecting on his beloved home, Elad spoke about his experience as an immigrant from Cameroon. He said, “My greatest ambition growing up was to come to the United States like Eddie Murphy.” Elad delivered a short but touching talk about how losing his job making sheetrock turned his world upside down, and how he found solace in painting at St. Francis House. “When I started painting, it was like nothing else existed,” said Elad. In this vein, “House, Home” showed that an artistic sense of “home” can transcend ownership of a house key.

Sexual predation. Innocence. Power. These are some of the themes explored by provocative photographer and video artist Laurel Nakadate in a new exhibition that opened at the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts last Thursday. The exhibit, entitled “Laurel Nakadate: Say You Love Me,” is composed of short videos showing young women and the artist herself in unsettling sexualized situations with older, middle-aged men.
Nakadate has been creating art since the 1990s, but this is the first time her work has appeared at the Harvard Art Museums. She spoke on an opening panel last Thursday alongside Professor of the Humanities Carrie Lambert-Beatty, Visual and Environmental Studies visiting professor Deborah Bright, and the Director of the Carpenter Center, David Rodowick.
At the opening show, Nakadate gave a lecture about her development an artist, starting with a documentary photography series about the secret world of women’s colleges she completed as an undergraduate at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, a partnership between Boston and Tufts University. “I’m a little nervous to even be showing this to you,” said Nakadate as she flipped though slides of women from Wellesley College, Mount Holyoke College, and Smith College at parties wearing revealing outfits. Nakadate said that the inspiration for this work came in part from the changing cultural standards during her childhood, and pioneering female photographers like Diane Arbus. “I came of age at a time when women were using their bodies to do extraordinary things. [The photography series] is about that generation: young feminists who are owning their own bodies.”
Another of Nakadate’s early projects was a performance piece called “Lucky Tiger” in which she took pinup self-portraits that emulated the style of suggestive photography that became popular during the 1940s. After she developed her photographs, she asked unknown men to handle the prints with ink on their hands to create a record of the project. “I consider a lot of my work performance work,” she said.
Another one of Nakadate’s performances was inspired by what she saw as the false happiness that people present on online networking sites. Nakadate decided to cry every day in 2010—and document it in 365 photographs. “I was trying to talk about how, through social networking, we’re giving away more than we should. People have complicated lives that include ups and downs. It’s more than happy status updates,” she said.
Currently, Nakadate is working on a portraiture project titled “Star Portraits,” for which she photographs strangers in remote locations at night. “Her work elicits strong reactions, both positive and negative,” said curator Michelle Lamunière, who organized “Say You Love Me.”
Now on display through December 22, “Say You Love Me” includes eight short videos featuring Nakadate alongside amateur actors. In “Lessons 1-10”, Nakadate, dressed in lingerie, reclines on a table while a man sketches her portrait. In “Happy Birthday” she poses as a Lolita figure at a birthday party with an older man. In “Beg for Your Life,” a man is held at gunpoint in the incongruous setting of a living room. Rodowick said, “The use of [familiar] locations and architecture in [Nakadate’s short films] are very meaningful. These are exteriors and interiors you see across the country, but at the same time they’re very unique … because they have been carefully crafted by the people who live there.” The film “Good Morning Sunshine”—among the more controversial works—includes narration by Nakadate as she plays the role of a sexual predator. “I really valued that the power could go back and forth. At one moment you fear for the girl and at the next you fear for the man. For me the artist’s job is to ask questions and then answer them,” said Nakadate. Speaking of the men in her videos, she said “a lot of [them] said they’d tried to have lives with someone but found it ultimately easier to live alone.”
When Rodowick pointed out that “these [men] are precisely the profile of the man children are supposed to be afraid of—misfits,” Nakadate was quick to respond, “When all they’ve done wrong is not marry and have children. You wouldn’t say the same thing about a woman who didn’t have children. My work asks the audience to challenge what they think about these men.”
She went on to say, “Whether we get married and have children or not, we are all that guy. The idea that if you get married you are safe [is] all crap. The bottom line is we ... can all be alone.”
Nakadate’s video work, namely her feature films “The Wolf Knife” (2010) and “Stay The Same Never Change” (2009), are filmed with amateur actors. The films explore lost innocence in young women. According to Rodowick, the work concerns “something I think is rare to see: young women being put in situations where desire is concerned, where they feel empowered and active but also extremely fragile.”Lambert-Beatty notes one of the reasons why the films are so engrossing: “everybody is constantly self-constructing and performing.”
Nakadate recognizes that her work is controversial, but she does not see that as a downside. “Of course there’s been criticism ... The process of making [work] is the most important thing. I think it’s valuable when art allows argument and wrestling—it’s a good thing both for [art] students and for people who love art.” She added, “It’s an honor that I’ve been at the center of so many arguments. It means [my art] is relevant.”
Lamunière says there is more to the works in “Say You Love Me” than first meets the eye.  “The viewer’s initial impression is that Nakadate dresses and acts provocatively to manipulate her fellow actors, [but] if viewers spend some time with the videos, I think they will see that the artist is not simply exploiting sexual desire, but rather exploring the complicated emotions associated with feelings of longing.”
Nakadate put herself in many uncomfortable situations when making the films, but she concluded, “I think a lot of really important work is terrifying to make ... when things get scary or challenge you, it means you’re onto something.”

OBERON
Directed by Brandon J. Ortiz ’12
and Ryan P. Halprin ’12
Music Directed by David R. Sawicki ’12 and Mark R. Parker ’12
Produced by Katie R. McNicol ’12 and Marta Bralic ’12
Spring comes early this year at OBERON with Duncan Sheik and Steven Stater’s “Spring Awakening,” a rock musical based on Frank Wedekind’s 1892 play of the same name. The musical follows rebellious genius Melchior Gabor and his newly pubescent friends as they learn about the facts of life, in defiance of an adult society in late 19th-century Germany which attempts to keep them in the dark. Their sexual discoveries and teenage angst are expressed via melodramatic rock songs.
Jonathan K. Stevens ’14 plays Melchior while Anna J. Mitran ’13 plays romantic interest Wendla Bergmann, with whom he explores his nascent sexuality. “It’s awesome that we’re both comfortable enough with each other to do the things that we have to do. There’s a lot of physicality, sexually and otherwise. It’s great that we can get into our characters,” says Stevens.
This is the second time that Harvard students have performed at OBERON, the second stage of the American Repertory Theater, after last year’s “Chicago.” As with that production, “Spring Awakening” is being adapted to fit OBERON’s unconventional space. In one scene, “Melchior and Wendla are right in the middle of the audience on these two blocks, six feet in the air,” says Stevens. Director Brandon J. Ortiz ’12 says, “Our goal was to remain faithful to the Broadway production. The biggest changes are a result of adapting to the stage. There are stages all around the audience. It’s the same show, but in a different dimension.” Ortiz says OBERON is perfect for portraying a split “between these two worlds: 19th-century Germany and a punk rock concert in the present day. The themes are from the 1800s, but the songs are contemporary rock.”
While OBERON provides a unique environment, performing there also has some drawbacks. “Working at OBERON is always challenging. At any Harvard student space you get a week of being on stage, but since OBERON is a professional venue we only get one day of run-throughs before we open. We have to load in our set with lights, music, everything,” says producer Katie R. McNicol ’12.
“Spring Awakening” has come a long way from being banned in the late 1800s, thanks in part to modern music and a different perspective on growing up. “It kind of has a cult following. It’s an interesting modern rock version of an old play with people coming into puberty and sexual awakening,” says McNicol.

Some musicians play for the casual listener, their legacy a series of sing-alongs that speak only through hackneyed lyrics and catchy beats. Some musicians play for the knowledgeable, their oeuvre a set of incomprehensible, boundary-pushing works that require decades of dissection. Far rarer are musicians with the skill and clarity to captivate both the layman and the critic. The playful Flecktones and their award-laden leader Béla Fleck are just such musicians.
Last Friday evening, Fleck and the Flecktones—a nominal throwback to 1960s rockers Dick Dale and the Del-Tones—took to Sanders Theatre as part of the Celebrity Series of Boston for two hours of non-stop bluegrass and jazz-fusion. From the onset, it was clear they are talented. Equally clear was that they know they are; the four musicians, and their eccentric guest violinist Casey Driessen, were at home on the stage. They coolly joked in between songs, tossed improvised solos back and forth, and allowed the timing of their songs to flow as they, not their audience, wanted.
Though their musicianship is made evident by their numerous accolades—including over 10 Grammy awards spread among the four of them—it was even clearer from their playful demeanor. Improvising difficult chord progressions, navigating tough transitions and riffs that would be technically impossible for most other musicians, Fleck and the Flecktones performed with an air of familiarity, humor, and humility, almost as if the Sanders stage were their living room.
The concert’s strongest moments were those in which the musicians took this playful spirit to its extreme, most significantly during bassist Victor Wooten and harmonica-player and pianist Howard Levy’s solo pieces. Wooten worked a very soulful and gentle rendition of “Amazing Grace,” in which the melody was played in harmonics while the accompaniment was transformed into a slapped-out funk beat. Levy comically tossed snippets of classical works—including Bach’s Bourrée in E minor and Strauss’s  “Blue Danube”—into his solo while pulling continually more impressive, full-sounding lines out of his harmonica.
The evening’s improvised interludes were also not to be overlooked. Particularly noteworthy was Driessen’s solo in the middle of the concert. In a peculiar creative choice for his instrument, Driessen transformed the violin into a percussive instrument, playing a blur of complex beats while simultaneously managing to include subtle chord progression. This innovation was characteristic of the performers; not only is their style an original fusion of a variety of genres, but their entire concert was centered on improvisation. Drummer Roy “Futureman” Wooten even played an electronic percussive instrument of his own invention—the Drumitar—throughout the concert.
Most impressive about Fleck and the Flecktones’ music was their ability to create enjoyable, comprehensible music while refusing to adhere to tonal structures. Chromaticism and dissonance were rampant in their improvisation, but the musicians added balance with repeated basic riffs and tonal sounds. Levy was especially skilled at building tension through dissonance to just a barely tolerable level and releasing it at the perfect moment—often with a descending scale. The excitement he created was mirrored in Fleck’s solos and was especially apparent when the two traded licks.
Occasionally, the band got caught in the trap of live performance, playing the most impressive rather than the most suitable series of notes and leaving out space that would improve the clarity and flow of their solos. This resulted in sporadic flurries of notes that, though challenging, were uninteresting at best. However, these moments were far fewer than those in which the musicians wove together tones, silence, and dissonance with a flair that proved true to their reputation.
Though Fleck and the Flecktones performed with technique of the highest caliber, they did so without an air of formality. Sound glitches and missteps resulted, but more important was that the musicians were not performing to entertain by however shallow means: there were no concessions in their style or their artistry to impress their listeners. Fleck and the Flecktones were simply playing pure and uninhibited music.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In January, the Common Application decided not to include a question about college applicant’s sexual orientation or gender identity in its widely used application. Last week, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 told The Crimson that despite that decision, Harvard College is considering giving applicants that option on its supplement in order to show prospective students that the College is a welcoming space for them. If it does, Harvard will join Elmhurst College, which was the first college in the country to pose such a question this year. Peer institutions such as the University of Pennsylvania are also considering such additions to their applications.
We welcome the College’s decision to offer students the option to self-identify as queer. Such a question does not force students to pick a label while offering students who wish to utilize the option the opportunity to show the College another aspect of their identity.
Harvard prides itself on recognizing the diversity of our student body, through demographic questions and public events such as Diversitas. Public recognition of diversity with regard to sexual orientation and gender identity is no different, and this move will reaffirm the College’s commitment to diversity in all its forms. As with other identity questions, providing applicants with the option of self-identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender shows that Harvard acknowledges and values these unique aspects of their identities.
It should be no secret that queer students are enthusiastically embraced at Harvard and have held top leadership positions in cultural groups, the Harvard College Democrats, and the Harvard Republican Club. The University covers a variety of medical options for transgender students and employees, has appointed openly gay housemasters, and recently opened a BGLTQ student resource center. Those of us on the inside know that Harvard is queer friendly, but prospective applicants often lack the same insights. The proposed question on the Harvard supplement would highlight that the University embraces queer students from day one.
However, we must be mindful that the way the question is phrased is just as important as whether the question exists at all. Less than 100 years ago, Harvard initiated a veritable witch-hunt to purge its halls of queer students. Fears of that prejudice persist to this day, and any solicitation of information regarding the sexual orientation or gender identity of prospective students must be clear about the information not being used against the students in any way. Additionally, it is important to remember that prospective applicants may have wide-ranging sexual and gender identities and to be willing to accommodate them.
The Harvard of the 1920s is not the Harvard of today, and we urge the College, come February, to make the right decision and to reach out to queer applicants in this manner.

I would like some of your money. Not all of it, not even the majority of it—but some of it would be nice. Worried about giving too much away? Well, you can never really give too much.
In fact, once I declare myself a 501(3)(c) organization, the United States government will match a portion of your gift. For instance, assuming a 35 percent marginal tax bracket, if you send me $1,000, the IRS will deduct $350 from your tax bill. I should point out, however, that you need to hurry because your deduction opportunity may not last.
In fact, President Obama has proposed limiting the charity tax break to 28 percent next year for those currently deducting 35. At the same time, voices in and out of Washington have called for axing the deduction in the name broader tax reform. The heart of the debate encompasses a papery mess of black and red budget columns, along with our conceptions of government, charity, and the rightful size of my wallet. Beneath all of that lies a worthwhile piece of a tax code so often detested, a piece worth preserving.
To begin with, a confusing slew of numbers: 300 billion, 50 billion, seven billion, two percent, ten percent, 16 percent.  Now, a deep breath and some digestion. 300 billion marks the approximate annual dollar amount of donations in the United States. Estimates place the sum deducted at about 50 billion dollars, from which Mr. Obama’s proposal subtracts about seven billion. (Only 35 percent of tax returns itemize deductions, instead of the standard deduction that ignores charity, so total donations dwarf $50 billion.)The 50 billion figure leaves charity deductions at little more than two percent of yearly government revenue. That limited price-tag, naturally, cannot itself justify a practice (at risk of okaying every $50 billion proposal that comes along), but neither does it brand the tax break as “unsustainable” in the face of reform.
The price does become significant, however, for charities themselves. Harvard University economist Martin S. Feldstein explains accordingly: “a substantial body of economic research shows that, on average, each 10 percent reduction in the cost of giving raises the amount [an eligible] person gives by about 10 percent.” In total, the tax deduction translates to about 16 percent of the $300 billion in annual giving. To the cancer research fund and the Make-a-Wish branch and the low-budget malaria-net disburser, 16 percent more giving matters. In the end, it may make all the difference.
But curbing the deduction, if not necessary, may offer pluses uncounted in those bland budgetary numbers. You might ask, should the U.S. subsidize private charity at all? You might likewise think: Why, instead of bolstering Social Security and its cousins, rely on the rusted whims of noblesse oblige? Surely, a government safety net has its place, but charity’s advantage lies in the organic energy of private forces, in their dependence on results, not the ossifying crowns of political favor. Private charity, despite ostensible foibles (e.g., reliability), consists of investors who can adapt and react to hold those charities reliable.
This goes beyond questions of relative efficiencies: Charities offer more. More variety, more focus, more acuity. In 2009, the IRS counted 1,238,201 non-profits, a number that speaks for itself. And robust quality matches that quantity. Fears of charity funneled to pet favorites of the rich and religious seem to call for government intervention, but the numbers (you can never have a big enough swirl of numbers) play out otherwise. Only 24 of Forbes Magazine’s 200 largest charities fall under “cultural” or “religious” (often very committed to the needy, too). Another nine are media-related, but those are radio stations. Public ones.
On the political spectrum’s other side, however, private charity faces its critics. Instead, some exhort, let money float along market tides and currents. End every distortion. Eyes swivel to Steve Jobs, who has eschewed philanthropy and yet enriched the world with innovation. Even his more charitable counterpart, Bill Gates, surely bettered global welfare much more while creating his own wealth and commendably handing it away.
As a general rule, that line of thinking makes sense. But much of charities’ laudable efforts—from food programs to biomedical research to my own fictional 501(3)(c)—need help matching their costs. And, moreover, triangulating nicely between efficiency and equity, tax-break charity has do-gooders evaluate a wide field to home in on winning programs. Private forces allocate funds (some of which, without the break, would be public) and hold charities accountable. A “welfare-market” of sorts, open-sourced but supported. A rare but worthwhile creature.
And still, there is something more. As we turn to the deduction itself, looking beyond my pecuniary hopes and the string of numbers and market philosophies, we can glimpse that other facet. The charity tax deduction says something. It says something about who we are as a society. It says that we can value something as a nation. It says that rising above a greyscale, amoral mush of competing national interests, we can orient ourselves. With it, we value charity as a good truly worthy of incentive and reward, not coercion. And if we can accept some meek act—donation to charity—some more than personal preference, then that says something about us. It says something good.

Not much happens in Central Pennsylvania. Kids go to school, play sports, and – when they get older—work.  Adults take care of the kids, watch sports, and work.  Usually religion is in involved in the weekly routine as well.  As someone who spent the first eighteen years of his life in a suburb of Pennsylvania’s capital city of Harrisburg, I can tell you that not much commotion takes place in the area of the Keystone State between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. Yet, residents of the area are generally happy people; we find ways to make life enjoyable. Usually this involves spending time with friends and family; invariably, it involves Penn State football.
It is hard to explain to an outsider the might of Pennsylvania State University within my home state. During the fall, the Nittany Lions usurp my local newspaper every Saturday (pregame coverage) and Sunday (postgame coverage).  I don’t even live that close to State College, the home of the university. The Patriot-News is located an hour and forty-five minutes from the supposed utopia commonly referred to as “Happy Valley.” Still, Joe Paterno and his team are of far greater importance than the professional Steelers or Eagles could ever hope to be.
For the past 40 years, Joe Paterno, a mere sports coach, has been the most powerful man in the entire state. Think of the governors, senators, and mayors who have all held the keys to the Pennsylvanian government over the past four decades.  “JoePa” had more clout than any one of them. This is the man who, after particularly unsuccessful seasons, told the university president and athletic director in 2004 that he would not be forced to leave the program. This is the man who runs the program that singlehandedly funds every other sports program (except basketball) at Pennsylvania’s largest university. This is the man who is primarily responsible for turning a university into the second largest economy in Pennsylvania. Without Joe Paterno’s 409 victories, PSU would never be able to draw such a significant amount of students from all over the state.
The recent Jerry Sandusky scandal brings the magnitude of Penn State’s power to light. JoePa’s defensive coordinator was under investigation for sexually abusing young boys in 1998, something there is no way a head coach of Paterno’s stature could not know.  JoePa’s head assistant coach, the man who was supposedly being groomed as his heir apparent, suddenly left his position with the team in 1999, but, for some reason, no one questioned the odd move. The Patriot-News first reported the scandal this March, yet, incomprehensibly, every other newspaper in the state decided that there was no story in one of the state’s biggest football personalities allegedly sexually abusing children. Contrarily, the newspaper says it received animosity for its purported defamation of the sacrosanct Penn State brand. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Central Pennsylvania.
Penn State’s hegemony does not solely gain it the distinction as first in the hearts of the countrymen.  The university’s dominance seeps into the Capitol, where the legislature provides an occupation for 28 PSU alums. The college provides the legislature with something in return—tickets to Beaver Stadium’s grandiose luxury boxes. Such a perk is worth prime capital in Central PA. When Governor Tom Corbett sensibly tried to find ways to balance the budget after consecutive years of fiscal impasse by reducing state funding in Pennsylvania’s independent schools, Harrisburg rose in opposition. Legislators would not tolerate the austerity of the 54 percent cut to their beloved institution and restored the majority of the funding.  Keep in mind that while Penn State is often referred to as a public university, it enjoys its secrecy too much to associate itself with the government. The university regales in its status as an autonomous establishment, as evidenced by its repeated refusal to release the salary of its employees (most notably that of Paterno).
Penn State obviously understands its colossal stature within the state, and the fact that it believed it could hide the fact that a prominent individual within the organization repeatedly assaulted children is grotesque. More grotesque is that it was very nearly correct.  The head coach, athletic director, president, and vice-president all, according to reports, allegedly knew about the monstrosity over ten years ago and successfully managed to keep it under the rug for a long time. One of the at least eight victims’ mothers says the police told her in 1998 not to tell anybody about the incident.  Even when the grand jury investigation was finally exposed to the public, Joe Paterno had the audacity to think he could just coach a couple more games before calling it quits.  He was evidently of the “I am Joe Paterno” mindset, in which his legacy is more important than the ruined lives of children.  Even if Paterno had followed the letter of the law and done everything he could have in the past to protect the boys (which it seems pretty clear he did not), the fact that he thought he could finish out the season knowing what  had occurred on his watch is inexcusable. That is not only hubris; it is sick, perverted hubris.
After Joe Paterno was fired, he was greeted favorably by hundreds of students outside his home excoriating the university’s decision. Former high school classmates of mine have changed their Facebook profile picture to Paterno’s face in solidarity with the plight of the man who could probably never become their persona non grata.
Many Penn State students and members of the community—probably a majority—understand the depth of the situation, as seen by the vigil the night before the Nebraska game. Yet, there still was a Nebraska game.  As long as there is a Pennsylvania, there will always be Penn State football. What else are Central Pennsylvanians going to do?

For most Harvard students, Veterans Day meant a day off of class.  For some, it meant camping out in the Yard.  For very few of us did it mean honoring those who have served.
I will confess—I did not attend any events celebrating the holiday. Yet, this can be explained by the fact that no events were adequately publicized.  It took many Google search attempts to come across Harvard’s official Veterans Day 2011 celebration, a ceremony in Memorial Church celebrating the return of the ROTC to Harvard.  Even so, this event seems more like a reminder of Harvard’s stance on “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell” than a genuine celebration of those who have fought to defend this country.  In comparison to the extravagance of Harvard’s 375th birthday celebration or the raucous celebration of Occupy Harvard, Veterans Day might just as well have been another Friday.  The one major on-campus initiative to support our veterans was a student-led table at the exit of Annenberg, where students could write thank you cards to veterans returning home.  On the one hand, it was refreshing to see the support of all the students who stopped to write letters, yet it is unfortunate that the students outdid the Harvard administration.
The most concerning aspect of the weekend was that, with a day off of classes, the attention of the Harvard community was fixed on those occupying the Yard rather than on one of the most meaningful holidays of the year.  What many of us take for granted is that fact that the freedoms we have in this country are only possible thanks to our armed forces.  The Occupy protesters, more than anyone, should appreciate these freedoms.  The very freedoms upon which the movement is based are made possible by our military.
Most of us studying at Harvard have chosen not to fight for our country.  Thanks to the men and women who enlist, we are not obligated to serve even at a time of war.  We can study and live our lives exercising the freedoms that are being defended on the front line.  What occupiers and the rest of the Harvard community ought to realize is that freedom is not free.  The country’s opportunity to thank the men and women who defend those freedoms has unfortunately come and gone with little attention from the Harvard community.
Instead of thanking those who risk their lives to defend our freedoms, Harvard students exploited those very freedoms by occupying the Yard.  I believe it is irresponsible for the Harvard community to have focused its attention on a group of rogue students camping out in the yard rather than on the Veterans Day holiday.  Even supporters of Occupy ought to recognize the disproportionate amount of attention devoted to the movement at the expense of properly recognizing Veterans Day.  Few Americans would argue against Veterans Day being more important, yet, judging by the amount of conversation about Occupy around campus versus that about Veterans Day, Harvard seems to have it backwards.
A personal political or moral opposition to the state of American income inequality does not exclude the Occupy protesters or the rest of the Harvard community from supporting those who have fought for the freedoms we have in this country.  America is like no other place on earth; thanks to the freedoms defended by our armed forces, people can do things like occupy the Yard.  Maybe the occupiers should spend a little less time victimizing the leaders of Harvard Management Company for their salaries and a little more time thanking those who allow them to express their opinions freely.
This is not about supporting the military.  This is not about supporting America’s wars.  This is not even about the Occupy movement.  This is about showing appreciation for those who defend the freedoms we have in this country.  If Harvard wants to stand by the values it holds so dearly, it ought to shift its attention from the tents spotting the Yard to the stars spotting the flag.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The College has expanded shuttle service in the morning, during one-day holidays, and over Wintersession following student criticism revealed by the results of an Undergraduate Council survey.
Shuttles will now run on a weekend schedule on Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, and Presidents Day. Over winter break, regular shuttle service hours will resume on Jan. 13 when the College reopens for Wintersession.
In an effort to address overcrowding, University Operations Services has also expanded the number of shuttles running to and from the Quad in the morning.
The changes took effect at the start of this semester.
The UC, working in collaboration with UOS and the Office of Student Life, issued a survey this spring soliciting student feedback on shuttle services.
According to UC Student Life Committee Chair Christopher A. Devine ’13, over 1,000 students responded to the survey, expressing dissatisfaction with two major areas: a lack of shuttle service on holidays and overcrowded shuttles on weekday mornings.
Administrators used the results of the survey to guide their decision to expand shuttle service this year.
“The UC shuttle survey results provided valuable student input that informed how we made some adjustments to the landscape of shuttle services, allowing us to address several concerns raised by students,” said Assistant Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich.
The changes come as a pleasant development for Quadlings, who have often complained about deficiencies in shuttle service on holidays and weekday mornings.
“As a Quad student I’ve called the shuttle services and emailed them plenty of times throughout the past year, because I’ve thought the fact that we didn’t have shuttle service on holidays was very unsafe for students,” said Pforzheimer House Committee Co-Chair Maya C. Ayoub ’12. “It being a holiday doesn’t mean that we’re doing any less than we are on normal days.”
Adams House Committee Co-Chair Anne G. Douglas ’12 said that despite the shuttle’s minimal role in lives of River students, the changes represented a positive change for the student body as a whole.
“The more shuttle service, the better,” Douglas said.
As recently as 2009, Harvard offered shuttle service on holidays. At the start of the 2009-2010 academic year, the College eliminated service on one-day holidays as part of a series of budget cuts.
According to Friedrich, this year’s changes in shuttle offerings represent a budget-neutral adjustment for UOS. The additional shuttle in the morning comes from redirecting pre-existing routes, and expanded shuttle service in January is possible due to alterations in the setup of Wintersession.
Because Annenberg was the only dining hall available to on-campus undergraduates in January 2011, administrators crafted shuttle routes with the aim of getting undergraduates to Annenberg during meal-times. This year, the College will open several dining halls for meals, freeing up shuttles for regular service.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction.
CORRECTION: NOV. 21, 2011
The Nov. 21 article "Shuttle Service Expanded To Mornings, Holidays" misstated the number of students that responded to a survey regarding shuttle service. That number was around 1,000, not 100.

Republican Presidential Candidate and Former Speaker of the House of Representatives Newt Gingrich hosted a movie screening and forum at the Harvard Kennedy School on Friday, prompting a group of Occupy protesters to disrupt the beginning of the event with a rehearsed chant.
Shortly after Gingrich arrived, Occupy protesters began chanting, “Mic check. Mic check! We love you Newt. We love you Newt! Thank you for standing up for corporations. They have rights too.”
Gingrich started to respond to the protesters, but they interrupted him mid-sentence to continue their chant.
“Thank you for understanding that simple point. We are the 99 percent!” the group yelled.
Many audience members were frustrated by the protesters.
“Go back to your tents!” shouted an audience member, prompting laughter and applause from many spectators.
But Gingrich was unfazed by the interruption.
“I think we are 100 percent. We are all Americans,” responded Gingrich to further applause.
Institute of Politics Director C. M. “Trey” Grayson ’94 gave the introduction to Gingrich’s talk. Grayson emphasized that audience members would be able to express themselves, as long as they were respectful to the visiting speaker.
“Before I introduce the Speaker and Mrs. Gingrich, I want to lay down the ground rules for tonight’s event. Freedom of speech and civility are bedrock principles for the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum and Harvard University,” Grayson said.
Grayson also announced shortly after 5 p.m. that Gingrich had encountered heavy traffic and would be late to the forum.
The former Speaker and his wife, Callista L. Gingrich, arrived around 5:40 p.m. and began to discuss their film “A City Upon A Hill: The Spirit of American Exceptionalism” when the protesters interrupted.
Grayson explained that question and answer sessions at the Forum are always “unfettered,” leading to interesting exchanges between speakers and participants.
“The reason why this is successful is our audience respects our speaker’s right to free speech, as well as our audience’s right to listen to our speakers,” he said.
Following the initial outburst, the remainder of the event ran smoothly, with an hour-long movie screening followed by a question and answer session with Gingrich.
Audience members pressed Gingrich on his stances on the issues of illegal immigration, female inequality, the educational system, and even beer.
“I am an MPA student at the Harvard Kennedy School from [pause] Europe,” began one man, prompting laughter from the audience due to Gingrich’s negative portrayal of Europe throughout his film.
After the man clarified that he was from Bavaria, Gingrich quipped, “Do you like beer?,” referencing Bavaria, the second largest brewery in the Netherlands.
“Everybody likes beer,” the man joked.
“But they don’t like American beer that much.”
Despite the early disruptions, Grayson said the event was successful.
“I’m excited to see the crowd. We didn’t know what to expect,” Grayson said.
Grayson admitted that if he were a student, he might have skipped the lecture.
“It ended up being the Friday before Harvard-Yale weekend. If I were an undergrad, I’d be at Toad’s right now.”

Nancy Barry died Saturday after being accidentally struck by a U-Haul truck at the tailgate preceding the Harvard-Yale Game in New Haven, Conn.
The 30-year-old resident of Salem, Mass., was remembered after her unexpected death for her creativity and her devotion to family.
“She had the best personality,” her mother Paula Barry said through tears on Sunday. “She was just the kind of person who went out of her way to be good to everybody. And she just had the most beautiful blue eyes and smile.”
Barry worked for lingerie maker Jacalyn E. S. Bennett and Company as a fashion designer and had previously designed apparel for New Balance.
She was artistic from a young age, her mother said.
“From day one, little girls were playing with their dolls and Nancy would be designing the clothes,” Paula Barry said.
Barry’s great-aunt Anne Marie J. St. Pierre said that Barry was part of a “very, very, very close-knit family.” The clan is abundant—Barry’s grandfather was one of 19 siblings, and most of their descendants still live in Salem.
At family gatherings, Barry provided the homemade cakes.
Barry was particularly close to her sister, her only sibling.
“Every time you saw her, she was with her sister,” St. Pierre recalled. “They were bound at the hip.”
Barry was also a favorite with her sister’s two young sons, for whom she sewed Halloween outfits and special costumes that the boys dreamed up for their make-believe games.
St. Pierre said that Barry was “150 percent devoted” to the two boys. She saw them about four days a week, according to her mother, and made sure never to miss one of their youth hockey games.
When Barry attended the Massachusetts College of Art and Design, she called her grandmother every morning while walking to class and every night before bed, Paula Barry said. After graduating from college in 2003, she continued to call regularly. She phoned her grandmother on Friday night before heading down to Yale early Saturday morning.
At Salem High School, Barry was a varsity athlete in soccer, gymnastics, and track who graduated sixth in her class.
“She was very intelligent, with a warm personality—a popular girl who did well in school and was involved in athletics,” said David J. Angeramo, who is now the principal of Salem High School and taught Barry in his calculus class. “She was just a pleasure to teach. You knew she was going to go on and be successful and have a great life.”
He flipped through the school’s Class of 1999 yearbook on Sunday to find Barry’s picture.
“She’s got a nice smile on her face,” Angeramo said, “just as I remember her.”
Barry was attending The Game with a group of friends, according to her mother. The women had been invited by their friend Sarah Short, a first-year student at the Yale School of Management.
Short was also hit by the truck, which was driven by a Yale student headed for a fraternity tailgate. Short is currently in serious but stable condition at Yale-New Haven Hospital. The cause of the incident is under investigation.
“They just went to watch The Game,” Paula Barry said on Sunday night. “They went down to tailgate and have a good time and it ended up in a tragedy.”

Harvard College received 4,245 applications for early admission to the Class of 2016,  the University announced on Monday. This year marks the first time that  the College has offered early admission since it eliminated the program four years ago.
The revived early program allows students to apply to the College by  Nov. 1 and receive a non-binding decision in mid-December. The process,  referred to as single-choice early action, stipulates that students only  apply to one school early.
“We’re never concerned about the numbers. It’s always about the quality.  And the impression so far is that the quality is very, very high,” said  Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67. “It’s  also the case that this is a very diverse group ethnically.”
Harvard, Princeton, and the University of Virginia eliminated their early admissions  programs in 2006, arguing that they unfairly benefited students from  privileged backgrounds.
“Early admission programs tend to advantage  the advantaged,” then-Interim University President Derek C. Bok said in a  statement in 2006. “Students from more sophisticated backgrounds and  affluent high schools often apply early to increase their chances of  admission, while minority students and students from rural areas, other  countries, and high schools with fewer resources miss out.”
Harvard and Princeton retreated from that stance earlier this year, with each announcing the return of early admissions within hours of each other. Though Harvard administrators had hoped other colleges and universities would follow suit in eliminating early admission, that trend never materialized.
In the February announcement of early admission's return, Fitzsimmons  argued that the circumstances had changed and that a broader group of  students sought to apply early.
In this year’s early admissions  pool, nine percent of the applicants are African American, up nearly two-thirds  from four years ago and nine percent are Latino, up almost one-third.  Seventy-two percent of applicants applied for financial aid, also an increase.
Still, Fitzsimmons acknowledged that the pool would likely be less diverse than the class as a whole.
“It  is certainly true that if you look at students from most ethnic  backgrounds and certainly true for students who need financial aid, they  are much less likely to have access to counseling that other students  would have,” Fitzsimmons said. “It’s certainly far [more diverse] than  it was in the past. I still believe that differential opportunities will  continue to produce the kind of results we’ve seen in early admission.”
Early application numbers at Harvard’s peer institutions varied greatly.  Yale received 4,310 applications, down 18 percent from the previous  year. Application numbers at Stanford University and the University of  Pennsylvania declined by less than one percent, from 5,929 to 5,880 and  from 4,571 to 4,526 respectively. Princeton received 3,547 early  applications.
Speaking to the Yale Daily News, Yale Dean of Admissions Jeffrey  Brenzel acknowledged the impact of Harvard and Princeton’s decisions to  bring back early admission.
“Though it is impossible to identify all  of the factors that influence early admissions numbers, it is clear  that the policies this year are allowing students to sort themselves out  more among schools,” he said.
Fitzsimmons offered no estimate of the number of students that will be admitted through the early action process.
“What  we’re going to do is what we always did. If we’re 100 percent certain  that we would take the person later, we’ll take the person early,” said  Fitzsimmons, noting that there was a very high bar of certainty. “We  have no quotas in our minds, no numbers. We don’t go there.”
More than 21 percent of approximately 4,000 early applicants to the  Class of 2011 received acceptance letters early, compared with an overall admissions rate of less than 9 percent. The acceptance rate for the Class of  2015 stood at a record low 6.2 percent.
Asked how the admissions office has adjusted to reading applications early, Fitzsimmons smiled and laughed.
“We’ve done this before, we know how to do this,” he said.

The No. 5 Harvard men’s squash team got off to a strong start Friday night, dropping just three games on the way to a 9-0 rout at No. 10 Williams in its first regular-season matchup of the year. But the win did not come without some difficulty.
“The score did not reflect the strength of Williams’ men’s team,” Harvard coach Mike Way said. “There were a number of matches where our guys had to work hard [to come away with the win]. We’ve been training very hard, and it was a much more of a battle than the score suggests.”
An impressive sophomore class—which currently boasts four of the top nine players in the lineup—led the way for Harvard, notching two 3-0 sweeps and four victories on the night.
“It was our first match of the season, so [the contest against Williams] really sets the tone for the rest of the year,” sophomore Brandon McLaughlin said. “I think everyone played pretty well. ... It felt good to get back on the courts.”
Competing at the No. 1 spot, McLaughlin took down Ephs senior William Morris, 3-1. Despite dropping the second game by a score of 11-7, the sophomore outscored his opponent, 40-26.
“It was the first time I’ve played No. 1 at Harvard, and I was facing the best kid on the other team,” McLaughlin said. “He was a senior and was playing in front of his home crowd. He played pretty well and seemed pretty pumped up. I just think I pulled it out at the end.”
Classmate Gary Power had a strong showing at the No. 2 spot for the Crimson, giving up just 10 points to Williams junior Nick Marks to take the matchup in three games.
“Gary and Brandon go back and forth sharing that top spot,” Way said. “Brandon has the upper hand right now. ... Gary had his guy pretty comfortably, but he had to work hard for it. [McLaughlin, Power, and sophomore Nigel Koh] are sort of our three main guys right now. They’re playing 1, 2, and 3, so that says something right there.”
Koh, who is also a Crimson business editor, rounded out the top three positions with a victory over Williams freshman Kevin Chen.
Koh struggled at the start of the contest, losing his first game, 11-5. But the sophomore bounced back, to take the second game in extra points and eventually win the final two games, 11-7 and 11-4, respectively.
Koh won each game by a larger margin than the previous frame to come away with the 3-1 win.
“Nigel never does anything easily, he’s just that type of player,” Way said. “He’s what we call an attritional player. He always has long rallies and won a very tough match [against Williams.]”
Harvard’s rookies also posted a strong showing on the court Friday night. Freshman Nicholas Hopcraft took down Williams sophomore Taylor Foehl in four games at the No. 4 spot, dropping the first before coming back to take the final three frames.
At the No. 7 spot, classmate Julian Kirby swept his first collegiate opponent of the regular season, 3-0, earning three tight victories, 11-8, 11-9, 11-9.
“The freshmen in the top nine seem like they’ve adjusted well,” McLaughlin said. “They will definitely contribute a lot for us this season. We’re really glad to have them.”
Six Harvard players won their individual matchups in three games, with Power, junior Zeke Scherl, sophomore Tom Mullaney, Kirby, junior Alexander Ma, and junior co-captain Jason Michas coming up big for the Crimson.
“[The match against Williams] was not an Ivy match, so it’s not as important, but it was a great way to start the season,” McLaughlin said. “We have high hopes for this year. We face Dartmouth in a couple of weeks. We’re hopeful and will see how everything plays out.”
The Crimson has enjoyed success against the Ephs in recent history, taking down Williams, 8-1, in the first weekend of last season and earning a 6-3 victory during the 2009-10 campaign. Friday night’s victory marks Harvard’s first sweep of the Ephs since 2006.
“[The match against Williams] was the first match of the season for the men, but the really big weekend was the Ivy scrimmages last weekend,” Way said. “Winning the Ivy scrimmages doesn’t mean anything, but it gives the guys a confidence boost and an idea of what they could achieve in the coming year.”
“We’re not going to get ahead of ourselves, but this match [against Williams] along with the Ivy scrimmages, sets the tone,” he continued. “Any sports cliché will apply, whatever boring quote you want to throw in there. ... We got the job done.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Things were not looking good for the Harvard men’s basketball team midway through the first half of its game against Loyola Marymount Saturday night in Los Angeles, Calif.
An Anthony Ireland three-pointer had given the Lions a 13-point lead and put the Crimson in early danger of losing its first contest of the season.
“They just came out really strong to start the game and we were kind of on our heels,” junior forward Kyle Casey explained.
But Harvard coach Tommy Amaker called a timeout to substitute in four new players, and things immediately began to turn around for the Crimson. Harvard (3-0) rallied to pull ahead by four before the end of the half and finished the game with a 77-67 victory.
On its ensuing possession after the timeout, co-captain Oliver McNally drilled a three to cut the LMU (1-2) lead to 25-15, and after a Lions miss on its end of the court, McNally knocked down another trey to cut the deficit to seven.
The teams then traded baskets as LMU went ahead 29-20 on an Ireland free throw with 5:47 remaining in the first.
But from there, the Crimson went on a 12-0 run to take back the lead. Co-captain Keith Wright began the stretch by hitting a short jumper, and junior Christian Webster and freshman Jonah Travis knocked down shots to cut the deficit to three.
“We got a lot of energy from the bench, particularly from Jonah Travis, who came in and gave us tremendous minutes,” Wright said. “He was definitely a low-post presence that sparked our team.”
Sophomore Laurent Rivard finished a three-point play on Harvard’s next possession to tie the game, and then knocked down a long ball to give the Crimson a 32-29 lead with 2:23 remaining in the half.
Two free throws by LMU’s Ashley Hamilton trimmed the advantage to one, but Wright followed with a three-point play to put Harvard up four. The teams traded baskets before the end of the half, with the Crimson going into the break up, 37-33, after a McNally fast-break layup off a Webster steal.
Harvard came out equally hot in the second, opening up a 10-point lead on a Casey jumper, Wright layup, and Casey dunk. That stretch capped a 25-5 run for the Crimson.
“They were trying to front the post, and they had a really strong front side,” Casey said. “We just kind of took what they gave us, and it worked pretty successfully.”
The teams went back-and-forth for a few minutes after that, until an Ireland layup cut the Harvard advantage to eight with 13:08 left in the game. But Rivard responded with back-to-back threes to open up a 14-point lead.
After freshman Steve Mondou-Missi knocked down one of two free throws on Harvard’s next possession, Rivard drilled another long ball to put the Crimson ahead, 60-42, with 9:52 to go.
“A lot of what we did tonight was trying to spread the floor,” Casey said. “They left Laurent open, and he’s a deadly weapon from three. He stepped up and made some big shots for us.”
After a Wright layup put the Crimson ahead, 66-48, with 7:39 to go, LMU began to chip at the Crimson advantage in a late attempt to get back in the game.
The Lions’ Godwin Okonji tipped in his own missed jumper on the next LMU possession, and Ireland followed a Webster turnover with a three-point play to cut the lead to 13.
Junior guard Brandyn Curry then turned it over for the Crimson, and two Ireland free throws trimmed the Harvard advantage to 11 at 66-55 with 3:43 remaining.
McNally subsequently gave away the ball for the Crimson’s third consecutive turnover, and after a Lions miss and two McNally free throws, LMU went on a 6-0 run to cut the Harvard lead to 68-61 with 2:40 to go.
But from there, the Crimson settled down and hung on for the victory, with McNally, Curry, and freshman Wesley Saunders going 9-of-10 from the charity stripe down the stretch to give Harvard the 10-point win.
Rivard led the squad with 20 points on 5-of-8 shooting from long distance. McNally added 16 for the Crimson, while the inside combination of Wright and Casey finished with 15 and 14 points, respectively.
Harvard shot better than 50 percent from the floor during the contest, and outrebounded LMU, 41-23.
Ireland led the Lions—who last week knocked off then-No. 20 UCLA on the road—with 26 points.
The victory against a tough non-conference opponent gives the Crimson momentum heading into its Battle 4 Atlantis tournament in the Bahamas next week.
“To come into someone else’s gym and come out with a victory is big,” Wright said. “It definitely feels good getting this win.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PROVIDENCE, R.I.—Entering halftime at Alumni Hall Friday evening, the Harvard women’s basketball team found itself down by just three to the hometown Friars, who were holding the largest lead of the game for either team.
Providence College quickly changed the dynamic when play resumed, as the Friars (1-3) jumped out to a seven-point lead with two quick baskets and ultimately left the arena with a 71-60 win—their first of the year.
“We looked tired or got soft or fogged out,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “I’m not sure exactly where the defensive breakdowns were. They beat us to loose balls; they beat us to rebounds. That’s all disappointing when it happens all night.”
Despite 19 points from co-captain Brogan Berry and a season-high contribution of 20 by junior Victoria Lippert, the Crimson fell to 0-3 for only the seventh time in the program’s history.
In the first half, neither team established a long-standing advantage. Only one lead was held for longer than two minutes in a period that saw eight ties and 11 lead changes.
As time expired in the half, Providence sophomore Rachel Pearson made a 15-foot jump shot to put the home team up by three entering the locker room.
Coming off the bench, Pearson contributed eight of her team’s 33 points in the first 20 minutes, while also netting six assists and three rebounds in her time on the court.
Yet the sophomore wasn’t nearly as successful in the second half, registering only two points and turning the ball over three times.
Although Pearson was unable to keep up her level of contribution, Friars senior Rachel Barnes stepped up in the second period. Barnes scored 15 in the last 20 minutes en route to a career-high 22-point effort.
Barnes had a knack for knocking down big shots on the night, including a three-pointer as the shot clock expired that pushed Providence’s lead to 45-40 after a small Harvard run had turned the contest into a one-possession ball game.
The clutch basket sparked a 16-4 streak that earned the Friars a 14-point lead. Yet, the Crimson responded with a 16-8 run that squeezed the Providence lead to six with just over one minute to play.
As time wound down, the Harvard squad needed only a couple of breaks to complete a comeback. But it got none, instead turning the ball over three times. The Friars pushed their lead back up to 11 before the buzzer sounded.
“We would go to the basket and then get soft,” Delaney-Smith said. “We would pass and then get soft.”
Throughout the game, the Crimson had trouble handling the ball effectively. The visitors’ comeback efforts were burdened by 22 turnovers that often came at the worst of times, ending potential scoring runs and giving the Friars valuable momentum.
The team tallied only nine assists in the game. It registered fewer than nine assists only four times in all of the 2010-11 season.
After the game, Delaney-Smith was blunt about the team’s play.
“Horrible, [I’m] very disappointed in them,” said Delaney-Smith of the squad’s performance. “They were too inconsistent, too schizophrenic, too undisciplined ... just some uncharacteristic play from us.”
The game’s lone bright spot may have been Berry, whose 19 points pushed her past Elizabeth Proudfit ’96 and into 12th place all-time in points scored in Harvard history with 1,116.
“At a time like this, it’s hard to celebrate those milestones, because I’m focusing on getting the team better and getting the team the first win of the season,” Berry said. “But it’s definitely an honor, and it says a lot to my coaches of the last three years and my teammates who helped me achieve that goal.”
Berry’s next chance to help the team win its first game will come in the Crimson’s home opener Tuesday.
“We have what it takes this year to be a great team and win a lot of ball games,” Berry said. “But today, we didn’t put all the aspects together. It showed on the court. We have a lot of room for improvement for the rest of the season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As most of the school focused on New Haven this weekend, the Harvard men’s hockey team split a pair of decisions in northern New York, beating Clarkson (7-4-3, 2-3-1 ECAC), 3-2, Friday evening before falling, 4-3, to St. Lawrence (4-6-0, 4-2-0) on Saturday night.
The power play was the story of the weekend. After a successful penalty kill in the final minutes of Friday night’s game, the Crimson (2-2-1, 2-2-1) could not replicate that success the following evening, allowing two goals when down one man in the loss.
“It’s always tough to go on the road and get the win … especially in the North Country [of Northern New York],” sophomore defenseman Dan Ford said. “But we were disappointed to miss a good opportunity to complete the sweep Saturday night.”
ST. LAWRENCE 4, HARVARD 3
Coming off of a strong team performance the night before, the Crimson came into the Appleton Arena Saturday night looking to build on its .500 record.
Despite an early lead and an even game late in the final period, Harvard could not defend a youthful Saints offense, led by freshman forwards Chris Martin and Gunnar Hughes, in the 4-3 loss.
Five minutes into the game, the Crimson converted its first power-play opportunity on freshman defenseman Patrick McNally’s second goal of the season. McNally’s score was one of four by Harvard defensemen this weekend.
Two minutes later, Martin fired a rebound past freshman goalkeeper Steve Michalek on a St. Lawrence five-on-four advantage. The power play would define the opening two periods, as each team converted its first pair of opportunities, including senior forward Jacob Drewiske’s strike that gave the Saints the lead with five minutes left in the first period.
The power-play goals from St. Lawrence left the Crimson disappointed in its penalty killing.
“On the road, you got to do the little things right,” Ford said. “They have the advantage of playing at home, and you don’t want to give them easy opportunities to score goals.”
Just moments into the second frame, Harvard leveled the game at two when defenseman Danny Biega hit a one-time shot past sophomore goalkeeper Matt Weninger. The goal was the junior’s second on the weekend.
Michalek made 28 saves on the day, including a stop on a two-on-one breakaway, but the Saints again reclaimed the lead on Martin’s second goal of the day halfway through the second period.
St. Lawrence maintained that lead for almost 20 minutes of play. Midway through the third, Ford scored another equalizer to even the game at three.
But the tie did not last for long, as Hughes scored three minutes later to put the Saints in the lead for good.
HARVARD 3, CLARKSON 2
Riding its victory over then-No. 18 ranked Colgate last weekend, Biega fired home a deflected shot with seven minutes left in the game, as the Crimson edged out Clarkson in a five-goal shootout at Cheel Arena.
Harvard was successful in killing the Golden Knights’ power-play opportunities, allowing only one goal in seven chances. The biggest test for the Crimson came in the last five minutes, as the squad had to kill a major penalty that left Harvard down a man for the remainder of regulation.
“There were a lot of guys contributing,” Ford said. “They were doing the little things right, [like] blocking shots and finishing checks. Those are the important things on the road.”
Harvard scored first on the power play, the first time this year that the Crimson has scored the first goal. Senior forward Eric Kroshus received the puck along the goal line and deked past a defender and the goalkeeper for his first goal of the year.
“I think really important for us is to start playing just physical out here … and try to score first,” freshman forward Petr Placek said.  “I think it’s really good for our team to be in the lead …[and] really concentrate on starting right away and not just battling the third period.”
But less than 30 seconds later, the game was tied again, as forward Nick Tremblay found the five-hole to beat Michalek.
The freshman had 30 saves on the day, while his Clarkson counterpart, senior Nick Karpowich, denied Harvard 24 times.
The Knights had four power plays in the second period, all of which the Crimson killed, including a 39-second five-on-three situation.
Harvard pushed forward on attack, and McNally hit a shot wide that shattered the Plexiglas behind the goal, causing a 15-minute delay in the game.
But soon, the Crimson was back in front when freshman forward Tommy O’Regan found the back of the net on a breakaway for his first collegiate goal.
But the Knights were not out. With eight minutes left in the game, Clarkson netted its only power-play goal of the day through sophomore forward Matt Zarbo.
“They had all the momentum, but we did a good job of sticking with our game plan and focusing on doing the little things right,” Ford said.
Harvard’s game plan worked, as less than a minute later, Biega rifled his shot past Karpowich with the help of some deflections.
And despite the late major penalty that left the Crimson down a man for the rest of the game, the team continued its strong penalty kill and rode out the pressure for an opening win on its road trip.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Building on momentum from a tight victory over Clarkson Friday night, the No. 10 Harvard women’s hockey team (5-1, 5-1 ECAC) closed out its first weekend at home with another conference win—this time over St. Lawrence (6-5-3, 3-4-1), 6-1, Saturday night at Bright Hockey Center.
“Anytime we can go into the weekend and come away with four points, that’s great for our team,” junior goaltender Laura Bellamy said. “But we still want to take everything one game at a time.”
The Crimson wasted no time getting on the board, as sophomore defenseman Marissa Gedman tallied her second game-winning goal of the season at 0:56 in the first period. Freshman forward Hillary Crowe and junior defenseman Josephine Pucci were credited with assists on the play.
“We got off to a great start [Saturday night], getting a goal less than a minute into the first period, and never looked back,” Bellamy said. “We tried to put on as much pressure as we could. ... You hope you can win a game when you score six goals, but the biggest part [of the win] was our all-around pressure.”
At 9:09, freshman defenseman Sarah Edney pushed the Harvard lead to two on a power play.
Edney, freshman forward Sami Reber, and junior defenseman Kelsey Romatowski worked the puck around in a strong man-up stretch before Edney tucked away the second goal of her rookie campaign.
“It was great to see us connecting and getting points on the board,” junior defenseman Josephine Pucci said. “We were also able to continue with that momentum throughout the game.”
Six different players scored goals for the Crimson Saturday night, and 11 players earned points, as a balanced offensive effort helped Harvard over the Saints.
“To have six different kids score just shows how well we are working as a team,” Bellamy said. “Our defensemen are getting some good looks on goal. … I think it’s definitely a positive to see how much everyone is pitching in on offense.”
The Crimson was especially effective on the power play, going three-for-five on the night with man-up goals from Edney, sophomore forward Gina McDonald, and Pucci.
“We have a lot of pride in our power play,” Pucci said. “Every time we get out there, we’re excited and we want to execute. It’s awesome that we’ve had some success in previous games [on power plays] ... but we want to continue to improve on it.”
In the second period, Harvard netted three unanswered goals to close the frame with a five-goal advantage. The Crimson scored twice in the first five minutes of the frame, as McDonald earned a power-play tally at 1:55, followed quickly by a goal from sophomore forward Elizabeth Parker at 3:28. Pucci netted a power-play goal of her own at 15:39.
“We just kept playing strong and never let up,” Pucci said. “That’s the biggest thing. It was great to have so many different people get points and do their part to get the win.”
Junior forward Jillian Dempsey led the team with five shots on the day, while Pucci topped the squad with four points on one goal and two assists.
Harvard also found success on the penalty kill, stopping all eight of St. Lawrence’s power-play opportunities.
“We know how important special teams is, and to be as successful in that area as we were [on Saturday] is also definitely a positive,” Bellamy said. “You don’t want to have eight penalties every game, but we did a great job killing them off. It was a team effort. We know we can depend on each other in penalty kill.”
Bellamy had a strong night between the pipes, recording 26 saves on the day. The junior netminder currently owns a .943 save percentage.
“It’s so huge for us that she’s been playing so well,” Pucci said. “It just gives us confidence, [because] she’s so strong in the back. We know we can depend on her back there. … She’s continuing to get better every day, and that’s definitely a big plus for our team.”
Down 5-0 at the start of the final frame, the Saints tallied their only goal of the game at 12:54.
But Harvard answered quickly, as Dempsey closed out the scoring for both teams with an empty net goal less than four minutes later.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the second year in a row, the Harvard fencing team made a statement at its opening tournament at the Garett Penn State Open this weekend in State College, Pa.
During the two-day competition, the Crimson faced off against perennial national title contenders, Princeton, Penn State, Notre Dame and Ohio State, and it did not come up short.
Defending national champion sophomore foil fencer Alexandra Kiefer and senior sabre fencer Caroline Vloka both captured gold medals for the Crimson, while freshman Emma Vaggo got on the podium by earning bronze in the epee.
“On the women’s side, what we have are some really top-notch fencers at every weapon. Alexandra Kiefer performed really well,” Harvard coach Peter Brand said. “She probably had an even better performance than she did last year, in fact. With Caroline Vloka, we saw the same thing. She won by an even larger margin than she did last year, so that has been really good sign for us as a team.”
For the weekend, six Crimson women finished in the top 20 of their respective competition.
Sophomore Alexandra Kiefer picked up where she left off last season by taking home the weekend’s top foil honors after slashing her way through a deep field of 50 entrants. Vloka also followed suit emerging victorious from a field of 41 that featured some of the nation’s top fencers such as Princeton’s Eliza Stone, the 2011 NCAA Tournament silver medalist, and Penn State’s Monica Aksamit.
In addition to Kiefer, Vloka and Vaggo’s medal-winning performances, junior Katherine Chou finished in 17th place in the foil, while freshman Kara Lee and junior Felicia Sun placed 12th and eighth in the sabre and epee, respectively. Rounding out the two-day tournament were sophomore Dakota Root and juniors Nadia Eldeib and Alexa Fishman, who finished in 27th, 30th and 45th in the epee, respectively.
The men’s squad also fared well at the Garret Open. Despite fielding a smaller roster due to injuries and illness with its personnel, the eight competitors from the men’s squad took part in the tournament on Sunday, with three fencers finishing in the top 10 in their respective weapon divisions. Leading the pack for Harvard was freshman Peregrine Badger, who got off to a strong start to his Crimson career by taking bronze in the epee in his first collegiate meet.
“It was a really exciting experience,” Badger said. “Everything just came together really well for me today, and I am happy to have gone far in this tournament.”
In addition to Badger’s breakout performance, freshman Alexander Ryjik and senior Valentin Staller took fourth and eighth in the saber, respectively. Rounding out the saber competition was sophomore Eric Arzoian, who finished in 21st place. In the epee, sophomore Michael Raynis, junior Benjamin Cohen, freshman Hikari Senju, and sophomore Nick Moore finished 22nd, 25th, 45th, and 46th, respectively.
“We had quite a few absences on the men’s side, so that makes it difficult to predetermine what that would mean for us,” Brand said.
Despite injuries for the men, Brand and Badger both remain confident of the prospects of both squads as the fencing season progresses.
“The biggest takeaway for us is that we still need to prepare for the Ivy season, but we are on our way there,” Badger said. “The main issue that we had this weekend were the injuries we have, so the next couple weeks will be focused on physical rehab and just getting everyone back into shape and ready for competition.”
To Brand, with this season’s seasoned group of upperclassmen and strong freshman on both squads, the Crimson are well within reach of the Ivy League title and a solid NCAA tournament showing.
“I think the combination of the men’s and women’s results this weekend bodes very well for us,” Brand said. “In every weapon, we performed fairly well. We had some outstanding results on the women’s and men’s sides, which I think anticipates where we will be later this season. If we can continue along this path, we can be very competitive throughout the year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Even with all eyes turned to New Haven, the No. 10 Harvard women’s hockey team (4-1, 4-1 ECAC) claimed not just one, but two dominant wins this weekend, beginning with a 2-1 takedown of Clarkson Friday night in its home opener. With the come-from-behind victory, the Crimson not only improved its wins record but also earned a season sweep of its league rivals. The two teams squared off on Oct. 29, when Harvard also captured a 2-1 win off of a last-minute overtime goal from sophomore defenseman Marissa Gedman.
“It’s huge for us to sweep [Clarkson],” junior netminder Laura Bellamy said. “It’s exactly what we wanted to do—to beat them in two close games. It shows us how competitive we are … and how well we’re playing together.”
The game didn’t begin as well as it ended, with the Golden Knights finding the back of the net first in the second period. Clarkson took advantage of Harvard’s third penalty of the match, with Jamie Lee Rattray accepting a pass from Hailey Wood and slipping the puck past Bellamy for the 1-0 lead just 6:45 into the second frame.
Despite strong chances for the Crimson, it was unable to get on the scoreboard until 15:01 in the same frame, when Harvard had a power play of its own, which gave it just the opportunity its offense needed. Gedman and sophomore Gina McDonald combined to offer the assist to junior Jillian Dempsey, who collected the puck and sent a shot past goalie Erica Howe for the goal.
“We have a really loose group, and we’ve come from behind a few different times,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “It’s a 60-minute game, whether we’re up or down, we have to play the same.”
The tie between the two squads did not last for long, though, with Harvard snatching the lead just 47 seconds later. Freshman Hillary Crowe gave the Crimson the one-up on Clarkson, fighting through a crowd of defensemen in front of the goal to lock the lead, accepting an assist from junior Hilary Hayssen and sophomore Kalley Armstrong.
“You never want to give up the first goal,” Bellamy said. “But getting [the lead] right back was all we needed…and was a huge momentum swing for us.”
The third period, though scoreless, saw many Golden Knight opportunities for an equalizer. Harvard gave up three penalties, one that even gave Clarkson a 5-on-3-man advantage, although it was ultimately unable to finish.  The Crimson defense, with Bellamy at its helm, helped hold the Golden Knights at one throughout the game and killed five of six power plays, with the netminder posting a stellar, match-high 29 saves.
“Our goaltending and defense did a great job,” Stone said. “We didn’t necessarily play as well as we could have, but at the end of the day, we got the job done. It’s just a matter of time that our kids will find a way to win.”
“We’re feeling good right now, having a lot of fun and playing well together,” Bellamy added. “We really weren’t too phased by going down … and it was great to get that win.”
Harvard was coming off of a 5-3 league loss to No. 2 Cornell–its first loss of the season and in the conference–going into the match against Clarkson. Despite three assists from Armstrong, the Crimson was unable to overcome the offensive intensity of the Big Red.
“Every day you play, you have to find a way to win differently,” Stone said. “If you lose, you just have to get after the next [game].”
With the win on Friday, Armstrong recorded her fifth assist of the season, a team-high for Harvard so far, while the Crimson offense posted 28 shots on goal, two less than the Golden Knights’ total and on par with its season average of 29.8. The Clarkson defense was just as effective on the power play, holding Harvard to a one-for-five count, a statistic that shows just how well matched the teams were.
“[Clarkson] is a team that will go on and do well this season,” Stone said. “This was a big [game] on a schedule filled with big games and big wins.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was never a question of whether a Harvard four would win the Tail of the Charles. It was just a matter of which one.
After a week of practices in which the Crimson’s top-two fours had raced evenly, Harvard’s A four, which turned in a time of 12:53.0, edged out its teammates in the B four by 1.7 seconds.
The B four, meanwhile, topped third-place Brown by 12.6 seconds.
“We can’t really ask for too much more,” said captain Mike DiSanto, who stroked the B four. “Everyone really showed up this morning. Harry had been talking to us about ending the season in a good way, and I think we think we definitely did that this morning.”
Because the crews each started around 30 seconds apart, rowers were unable to gage their progress by looking at other boats.
“It was basically like a time trial,” junior three seat James O’Connor said.
“There was nothing going on around us,” added senior stroke Pat Lapage. “We had to channel any aggression into getting the most out of each other.”
The Crimson’s winning crew consisted of O’Connor, Lapage, junior Josh Hicks, sophomore Andy Holmes, and junior coxswain David Fuller.
Harvard’s B four consisted of DiSanto, sophomores Caspar Jopling and Andrew Reed, senior Sam O’Connor, and senior coxswain Alex Sopko, who is also a Crimson sports editor.
“In our boat, we knew our best competition was going to be [the A four],” DiSanto said. “We realized if we wanted to do well and be close to them, we were going to have to row a really strong race.”
One of the most impressive finishes of the day came from Harvard’s E four, which finished sixth overall.
The unexpected result was good for fifth among A fours and second among B fours.
Meanwhile, the Crimson’s D and C fours took ninth and 10th, respectively. The C, D, and E fours defeated all other C, D, and E fours. Harvard’s F, G, and H fours also won their divisions.
“The sophomores have done a good job of coming in and pushing us,” Lapage said. “No one’s taking their seats for granted. The squad as a whole is pretty competitive internally. We’re usually well prepared for racing externally.”
LIGHTWEIGHTS
After a fall season in which its top boats had cleaned up on their lightweight competition, the Crimson lightweights finished the season racing primarily heavyweights.
The Harvard lightweight A and B fours finished 12th and 14th overall. The next fastest lightweight boat, MIT’s A four, finished 82 seconds off the Crimson’s B four.
“I thought we put in a pretty good piece,” said senior Tim Moore, who rowed in the two seat of the A four. “I think we were a little disappointed. Our bow number was seven, and we finished 12th. A lot of those boats ahead of us were Harvard heavyweight crews. We know how deep their team is, how strong they are ... I think it was still well rowed and well executed.”
The Crimson’s B four finished 11 seconds off its A four.
“I thought we really had one of our best pieces out there,” sophomore stroke Michael Wales said. “We came together as a boat and just got it done.”
Harvard’s C and D fours boat finished ahead of the Engineers’ lightweight B four.
FRESHMEN
While the fours race was a tight battle between the top-two crews, the freshmen eights race was anything but.
The Crimson won by nearly 30 seconds.
“I think that’s just a testament to Billy [Boyce’s] coaching and the guys as rowers,” DiSanto said. “They see how the varsity squad is, and they want to be competitive.”
While the heavyweights chose to stack their top boat, as is tradition, the lightweights took a different tack and raced even lineups. The two boats finished 18 seconds apart, and were second and third among lightweight crews, behind MIT’s A boat.
“I was really pleased with how some of the novice guys were able to hold their own,” said lightweight freshman  coach Linda Muri. “In practice, you can usually count on those guys. I thought they really stepped up to the challenge.”
Muri was also pleased with her C boat, which defeated MIT’s C boat as well as UMass’ heavyweight A boat and heavyweight B boats from Brown, Harvard, and BC.
“They definitely kicked ass and took names,” Muri said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After losing its first two games in the Collegiate Water Polo Association Eastern Championship tournament, the Harvard men’s water polo team ended its season with a win over Iona Sunday morning to claim seventh in the league.
The Crimson (10-20, 6-9 CWPA) hosted the three-day tournament at Blodgett Pool and earned its highest finish in the tournament since Harvard last hosted Easterns in 2007.
“When you think about it in the context of our season, not only did we [qualify for Easterns] but we also beat our seed,” said senior two-meter Evan Zepfel, an inactive Crimson sports editor. “I can’t think of anything better than that for our team.”
HARVARD 13, IONA 10
Despite two losses and on the weekend behind them, Harvard ended the season on a positive note with an upset 13-10 win over Iona (14-16, 3-2).
The defensive-heavy game began with a low-scoring first half, in which Harvard’s pressure defense forced five Gael turnovers Senior goalie Alex Popp contributed seven saves.
Although Iona was the first to get on the board midway through the first quarter, a 3-1 Crimson run in the second gave Harvard the 4-2 lead by halftime.
The Crimson continued on to dominate the third quarter with six goals, four of which were scored on back-to-back possessions.
The Gaels came to fight in the third quarter, putting up three unanswered goals in the opening minutes of the stanza. But three Harvard goals to close the game helped the Crimson secure the victory.
Senior attackers Mike Katzer and Kevin DiSilvestro recorded three and two goals, respectively, in their last performance as Harvard players.
BUCKNELL 13, HARVARD 11
With its sights set on an upset and a comeback victory all in one, the Crimson took Bucknell (15-10, 5-3) into double overtime in the tournament’s second round on Saturday.
Six players fouled out after earning three ejections, and another two were disqualified from the game due to misconduct.
The Crimson finished the game with only enough eligible players to field a single lineup.
Katzer said he was very impressed with Harvard’s showing, considering the Crimson played with limited depth for a significant portion of the game.
“We had to finish the game with our backup goalie playing the field,” Katzer said. “We had three guys in the pool who had played maybe five minutes the entire season. This was from midway though the fourth quarter in through overtime.”
“The Bucknell game was one of the most impressive games I’ve been a part of in my career,” Zepfel added. “That’s going to go down as one of my favorite memories ever. “
With only seven men eligible to compete, the lengthy back-and-forth competition likely took a toll on Harvard’s remaining players.
Freshman two-meter John Holland-McCowan netted four goals in the game—three in the fourth quarter alone—but his efforts were not enough to overtake the Bison.
NAVY 20, HARVARD 5
Navy (24-7, 5-3) dominated the Crimson Friday afternoon on its way to claiming second place in the Eastern final.
While Harvard put forth one of its most cohesive defensive efforts this season at first, the Crimson men were simply outmatched by the strength and speed of Navy’s talent and sent into the loser’s bracket for the remainder of the tournament.
Less than one minute into the game, junior two-meter Max Eliot put Harvard up 1-0, but the Crimson was unable to come up for air after that.
Navy scored four unanswered goals following Eliot’s score and continued at such a pace for the remainder of the game.
Harvard relied on its depth, rotating through most of its roster throughout the game.
By the second half, Navy had easily worn down the Crimson, who was unable to provide an effective resistance to the Navy offense.
This, combined with long droughts in scoring, resulted in a dismal showing for the Crimson and rough start to the weekend’s play.
“They have a lot of depth, and they throw waves of players at you,” Katzer said. “We hung on for as long as we could. But at least, the younger guys learn from playing against [teams] of [Navy’s] caliber.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After Harvard’s win over Penn last Saturday, the Crimson clinched the Ivy title outright. And so in a sense, that was the end of the story. The hero vanquished the villain. The guy got the girl.
But with one game left in the schedule—the biggest contest of the season, The Game—Harvard still had to fight for that often-elusive happily-ever-after.
And with a resounding, emphatic, 45-7 decimation of Yale, the Crimson earned just that.
The Game quickly became a microcosm of the Harvard season. After a slow start, a stingy defensive line and an historically high-octane offense tore apart the opposition. Once the Crimson found its rhythm, Yale—like the past eight teams Harvard has faced—couldn’t handle the music.
In his final contest in a Crimson uniform, senior quarterback Collier Winters penned his greatest masterpiece of all—his Beethoven’s Ninth—with a 355-yard passing performance, in addition to rushing for 62 yards on the ground.
Yet the decisive victory didn’t seem so certain at first. Before climbing to the top, the Crimson dug itself a hole.
Charging down the field to begin the game, Harvard looked poised to score in the game’s first possession. But Winters coughed up the ball in the Bulldog end zone, handing it over to Yale at its own 20.
The Bulldogs struck first just a few minutes later, putting the home team up by seven.
All of a sudden, what was billed as an easy Harvard victory looked very much in question.
But at this point, that shouldn’t be too surprising. In game after game, the Crimson has fallen behind only to catch up and cruise to an easy victory.
Indeed, that’s the very story of the Harvard season. Like so many champions, the Crimson started off slowly in 2011 before leaving the pack in the dust down the homestretch.
The Crimson dropped its first game of the season in an ugly 30-22 loss to Holy Cross. With miscues and blown overages galore, Harvard looked like a sloppy ragtag crew, not potential Ivy champions.
But then, something for this Crimson team clicked. Harvard beat Brown, 24-7, and after that, Harvard was off to the races. The once mighty Penn just became the Sham to Harvard’s Secretariat.
And the same pattern emerged at Yale on Sunday. The Bulldogs took the lead, Harvard made it neck and neck, and then the Crimson exploded, leaving Yale in the dust.
After the Bulldogs found the end zone in the first, that would be the end of Yale scoring for the afternoon. And Harvard would rattle off 45 unanswered points before the contest came to a merciful end for the home team.
For the Crimson, it became the exclamation point on an historic season, a perfect Ivy season. No Harvard team in the modern era had scored as many points as the 2011 version.
On Saturday, it showcased the many reasons why.
Of course, there’s Winters, who combined for three touchdowns on the day. But Winters has an arsenal at the ready with the best receiving corps in the league. In addition to four talented wide receivers, Harvard also has the two best tight ends—junior Kyle Juszczyk and sophomore Cameron Brate—in recent memory. On Saturday, the two combined for 145 receiving yards, highlighted by Juszczyk’s 60-yard touchdown catch.
The backfield tandem of junior Treavor Scales and freshman Zach Boden also wrought havoc on the Bulldog defense. Scales averaged 4.5 yards per touch, and the wunderkind Boden continued to make a very compelling case for Ivy League Rookie of the Year with 63 receiving yards and 20 more on the ground.
The vaunted Harvard defense followed suit. The Bulldog rushing game managed just 2.5 yards per rush against the most dominant front seven in Ivy League football. And through the air, Yale didn’t have much success either, though part of that can be attributed to Yale quarterback Patrick Witt’s subpar performance.
But overall, on a Senior Day at the Yale Bowl that was designed to celebrate the Bulldog seniors, it was the Crimson seniors who stole the spotlight.
And not just Winters. Wide receiver Alex Sarkisian tallied 97 receiving yards and one touchdown reception.
Captain and middle linebacker Alex Gedeon earned nine tackles—tied for second best on the team—and stepped in front of Witt’s pass late in the fourth quarter for a pick-six.
Defensive tackle Josue Ortiz, double-teamed nearly all game yet again, managed to break free and earned his 10th sack of the season. His biggest play, though, came after the final whistle.
And so ends the career of this senior class, the one that helped produce the most prolific offense in Harvard history, the one that brought the Ivy title back to Cambridge, the one that produced, in Harvard coach Tim Murphy’s mind, one of the all-time great captains of Crimson football.With those big holes will come even bigger questions.
But with a host of underclassmen already playing and the most efficient passer in the Ivy League waiting in the wings, Harvard should return to Soldiers Field next year as the favorite to win it all once more.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW HAVEN, Conn.—Senior quarterback Collier Winters missed four of the first five games this season.
But in just six starts, he has somehow managed to put himself in the running for Ivy League Player of the Year.
Winters had another strong performance in the final appearance of his collegiate career, throwing three touchdowns—two passes, one run—in Harvard’s blowout 45-7 win over the Bulldogs in the 128th playing of The Game. It was the third time in the last five games that Winters threw for at least 300 yards passing.
Set up by a 29-yard run from freshman running back Zach Boden—a favorite to win Ivy League Rookie of the Year—Winters ran it in from four yards out to tie the game at 7-7 with just under four minutes in the first quarter.
After Yale fumbled on its next drive, Harvard regained possession on its own 43-yard line. Three seconds into the second quarter, Winters hit senior wide receiver Alex Sarkisian over the middle to give Harvard a 14-7 advantage. The Crimson never trailed again and had a 24-7 lead by halftime.
“I think that most of the credit for our passing game goes to the offensive line,” Sarkisian said. “They gave Collier time to sit back there and make decisions—he makes great decisions—and the offense can really run smoothly.”
Even in just six games, Winters is in the conversation for Ivy Player of the Year. The red-shirt senior completed almost 70 percent of his passes and averaged just over 265 yards per game. Winters scored 20 touchdowns in 2011—13 in the air, seven on the ground—to lead Harvard to its most prolific offensive season in the modern era.
Winters scored more touchdowns this year than the entire Princeton team.
ON THE MARGINS
Harvard has won nine straight games, and not many of them have been close.
After falling behind early, Harvard won The Game by a 38-point margin, the largest defeat for either team since 1982, when the Crimson beat the Bulldogs by an identical 45-7 total.
No one has won by a margin greater than that since 1957, when Yale won in New Haven, 54-0.
In its last nine games, Harvard has made a habit of easy wins. In addition to setting the program’s scoring record, the Crimson also held opponents to single-digit totals four times this season.
“This group is really, one, extremely coachable,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “Two, very, very selfless. The team chemistry on this team was really exceptional. The kids really cared about each other, respected each other.”
After the Crimson suffered what would be its only loss against Holy Cross in the first week of the season, Harvard followed up with back-to-back performances that kept opponents in the single digits, first against Brown and then at Lafayette.
The strong defensive effort all year wasn’t always in full force. The team had a number of games when it struggled, including a 41-31 win over Cornell and 56-39 victory over Princeton two weeks later.
Even in the last three weeks, the Crimson has trailed in all three games. But Harvard still managed to win those contests against Columbia, Penn, and Yale by a combined margin of 117-48.
“[Saturday] was such a balanced effort,” Murphy said. “Really got a great effort from and execution out of our special teams, and defensively, the last two weeks, those are probably the best back-to-back defensive games we’ve played in a long time.”
After one successful drive from Bulldog quarterback Patrick Witt in the first quarter, Harvard shut down the former Rhodes Scholarship finalist. Witt was intercepted three times, and Yale never got closer to the Crimson end zone than the 30-yard line in the second half.
BIG DAY FOR JOSUE
In a two-week period, senior defensive tackle Josue Ortiz has earned and presented two different rings.
Against Penn, Ortiz led the team with 10 tackles and two sacks to help Harvard clinch the Ancient Eight title outright.
And this week, he made big news—and SportsCenter—when he proposed to his girlfriend, Kayci Baldwin’14, at the end of the game.
It may be his most memorable moment in a Harvard football uniform, but it might not be his most impressive. Ortiz capped his career with a sack in Saturday’s game, his 10th this season—meeting his preseason goal—bolstering his candidacy for Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year.
Senior defensive tackle Matt Lunati was second on the team in sacks with 2.5.
Ortiz is one of a handful of current Crimson seniors attracting NFL attention, though the defensive tackle only came onto the scene after a breakout 2010. Throughout this season, Ortiz was regularly double-teamed but still finished the year leading the league in sacks. He fell just short of breaking the all-time single-season sacks record for Harvard.
“It’s been great. For me and Josue, for five years we’ve been able to beat Yale,” Winters said. “It’s been awesome, and a great way to go out and to go out on top for us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following The Game Saturday, senior defensive tackle Josue Ortiz left New Haven with more than a 4-0 career record against Yale; he had a fiancé.
Surrounded by celebrating teammates, classmates, and alumni after Harvard’s 45-7 drubbing of Yale, Ortiz moved to the sideline to scope out the field, searching for his girlfriend of three years, sophomore Kayci Baldwin.
“A bunch of Callbacks [an a capella group] were chasing me as I was looking for Josue in the huge mass of football players and fans,” said Baldwin of her friends following her with iPhones recording. “I was thinking, ‘Why is everyone so excited to see Josue?’”
Baldwin finally found Ortiz on the sideline, and a circle of friends and teammates formed around the couple. She tapped him on the shoulder and asked why he wasn’t on the field.
He responded, “Because I’m proposing.”
Ortiz got down on one knee, in front of over 53,000 fans and a national television audience.
The couple met prior to Baldwin’s freshman year at a summer campus conference for all of the college students in the International Church of Christ. They became friends that summer, and their romance grew when she entered college.
“It’s interesting because when we met, she wasn’t even going to Harvard at the time. She emailed me saying she was applying, and I wished her luck,” Ortiz said. “We started going to church here together, and we became great friends ... then we fell in love.”
Ortiz had been thinking of proposing for a few months, and he contacted Baldwin’s mother to assist in the planning. He, her mother, and her grandmother went shopping for the ring—a yellow gold ring with a sapphire stone, a tradition for the women in Baldwin’s family. Her mom contacted one of Baldwin’s friends and fellow Callback, sophomore Rachel Gladstone, to prepare Baldwin as much as she could for the big surprise without spoiling it.
“I was hoping it would happen soon, but I didn’t expect him to do it [after the game] because he’s so focused and dedicated to his team, I thought he wouldn’t even been thinking about it until later after the season,” Baldwin said. “I was absolutely shocked.”
“My entire team knew, but she didn’t know at all. I told my team that I wasn’t going to go home with them after the game,” Ortiz said. “After the game, we went out to dinner together with our families.”
Both the families came up for the big game and day, and it was the first time their parents had met, despite talking several times previously.
The couple announced their engagement to Baldwin’s church this morning, and then traveled back to campus together to finish out the week and return to Baldwin’s for a Thanksgiving together.
As for setting a date, Ortiz and Baldwin are waiting to see what Ortiz will do next year.
“Right now, I’m thinking about the NFL for next year. We’ll know more about that and what our plans are then,” Ortiz said. “So, we are taking it slow.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While Harvard’s athletic attention may have been focused on The Game over the weekend, the men’s swimming and diving team was busy in the pool.
The Crimson squad traveled to Chapel Hill, N.C., and placed fifth in the Janis Hape Dowd Nike Cup, a meet that started on Thursday and culminated on Saturday.
Coming off of back-to-back Ivy wins last weekend against Dartmouth and Cornell, the team joined in a very competitive field consisting primarily of Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) schools.
Harvard earned 280 points overall in the meet, falling to No. 12 University of North Carolina (1,334), Navy (752), Duke (572.5), and the University of South Carolina (508.5). Other teams in the meet included Old Dominion, East Carolina, and No. 19 North Carolina State, which took sixth, seventh, and eighth, respectively.
“The entire team was going into the meet a little broken down, but I think on the whole the team responded pretty well,” sophomore Chris Satterthwaite said. “It was a good meet overall for the team, definitely a good experience for us.”
On Saturday, standout diver Mike Mosca took fifth place in the three-meter dive event with a score of 340.65—the second of two solid results on the weekend for the freshman.
“We were going up against some of the best teams in the country,” Mosca said. “In order for us to go out there and give it our all—even though we knew we were at a different level—was good at a team standpoint, knowing that we can suck it up and swim fast and dive hard.”
Mosca’s adjustment to collegiate diving has gone smoothly, thanks in part to his teammates.
“I have never really been part of a team, and the team aspect is a really nice thing to have because you are not really diving for yourself anymore ... it is always a good thing to have a different motivation,” Mosca said.
In the 100-yard freestyle, the Crimson’s Satterthwaite took sixth place and was .67 seconds shy of breaking his personal record in the event, finishing in 45.28.
Satterthwaite had a full day on Saturday, also competing in the 400-yard freestyle relay with freshmen Griffin Schumacher and Zach Walters and sophomore Oliver Lee. Together the quartet’s effort was good enough for a sixth-place finish.
On Friday, Mosca had a very strong dive, finishing fourth in the one-meter competition with a total of 352.35, 9.45 points behind the first-place competitor.
Also on Friday, the Harvard 800-yard freestyle relay squad of Satterthwaite, freshman Michael Gaudiania, sophomore Spenser Goodman, and Walters finished fourth with a time of 6:45.70.
Gaudiania also competed individually in the 400-yard individual medley and posted a time of 4:01.57, which was good for seventh place. Sophomore Jack Pretto also finished seventh place in the 100-yard backstroke with a time of 50.55.
On Thursday, the 200-yard freestyle relay was Harvard’s most successful event. The Crimson relay squad was composed of Schumacher, Satterthwaite, and Lee, who joined up to finish fifth with a time of 1:51:30.
Another notable finish on Thursday came from freshman Chuck Katis, the sixth-place finisher in the 200-yard individual medley with a time of 1:51.30.
Throughout the meet, Harvard was well-entrenched in fifth place, unable to make the necessary breakthroughs to climb up the standings. But having faced a challenging field, Mosca remained upbeat.
“That much competition for everyone was tiring, and for us to keep going through, we need always need to have high morale, and we did that, so I think that was a major factor,” Mosca said.
Next up for the Crimson will be the USA Swimming National Championships to be held on Dec. 1 in Atlanta, Ga. The next diving event will be on Dec. 2 at MIT.
“As a whole for the team, what we did this weekend was good, but it also showed us some spots we can work on, particularly longer-term endurance,” Satterthwaite said. “Building up the aerobic base to go into the three-day, extended meets and come out on top.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The top-ranked Harvard women’s squash team opened the season with a bang, defeating both Stanford and Williams last Friday in Williamstown, Mass.
The Crimson (2-0) lost only three games all day, with its top six going undefeated in the squad’s 6-3 victory over the No. 6 Cardinal (4-1) and its sweep over the No. 9 Ephs (1-2).
Harvard All-Americans Laura Gemmell and co-captain Cece Cortes did not play, but the Crimson was still able to show its dominance on its opening day.
“It was a good start to the season,” said co-captain and All-American Nirasha Guruge. “I thought everyone played well despite the long trip to Williams and having two matches back-to-back.”
HARVARD 9, WILLIAMS 0
In the second match of the day, Harvard continued its dominance over the Ephs, notching its 30th straight victory against the host squad. The Crimson nine did not lose a single game en route to a 9-0 sweep of Williams.
Harvard overpowered the Ephs with a strong showing despite just coming off of a relatively close battle against Stanford.
“We definitely have a really strong team this year,” junior Sarah Mumanachit said. “It was our second match of the day, and everyone still had their mind set on match day and brought everything to the table.”
At the No. 1 spot, Guruge won a hard-fought match, with two of her games only decided by two points in her 3-0 victory.
The match at the No. 2 spot was also contested, with freshman Haley Mendez’s opening game decided by a score of 12-10.
But she easily won the next two games, winning 11-3, 11-6.
Mendez’s experience with the U.S. National Team helped her in her opening day on the Harvard squad.
“It’s a pretty high position to play as a freshman,” Guruge said. “I think she really stepped up. She’s handled this challenge pretty well.”
HARVARD 6, STANFORD 3
Earlier in the afternoon, the No. 1 Crimson defended its lofty ranking with a 6-3 victory over the Cardinal.
With Gemmell feeling under the weather and Cortez currently injured, the top six of Harvard stepped up and overcame tough losses in the bottom three.
“We were resting our No. 1 player, so everyone moved up one,” Guruge said. “But people have off days, so as long as we won overall, I think it is fine.”
A few individual matches went to four games, but the Crimson was able to make adjustments throughout the afternoon, shaking off opening day nerves and rust.
“I think some of us were just working out some kinks,” Mumanachit said. “But everyone made adjustments and improved later on in the match, and it shows a lot of promising things for the future.”
Another freshman, Julie Chu, playing at No. 5, won three straight games after losing her first, 11-8.
Mendez also played well, capturing an 11-0 win in the second game as she shut out her opponent, 3-0.
“A couple of them were pretty nervous,” Mumanachit said. “But I think just getting into it and seeing how good they are and seeing how their hard work has paid off calmed their nerves a bit later on.”
Harvard has been looking to improve upon its fitness early this season, drawing upon a new system from the team’s new coaches.
Winning two matches in a row demonstrated the squad’s improvement in this area.
“We’re focusing on building our fitness level this semester,” Guruge said, “so that we can taper off next semester when we have to play the really hard matches and play nationals and fight for the Ivy League championship.”
These hard matches will take place later on in the season, but the Crimson still took care of business during the Harvard-Yale weekend.
“Playing Williams and Stanford is not that tough for us, but that didn’t mean we took it easy; we still gave it our best and were prepared to play them,” Guruge said.

On Sunday the Harvard wrestling team competed at the Keystone Classic in Philadelphia, Penn., where the squad’s top performers showed their opponents anything but brotherly love.
The Crimson placed five members of its squad within the top six in their respective weight classes, with co-captain Walter Peppelman taking the title at 157 pounds, and junior Steven Keith and sophomore Cameron Croy dropping close title bouts to both take second place at 133 pounds and 184 pounds, respectively. Harvard earned fifth place out of 11 squads in the overall team standings.
After mustering a third-place finish at last weekend’s Binghamton Open, No. 1 seeded Peppelman rebounded to defeat No. 3 Dan Kolodzik of Princeton. In the final matchup, Peppelman took an early 2-0 lead and never looked back, eventually shutting out his opponent, 3-0. Throughout the day, Peppelman gave up just one point in his three matchups.
“He did a great job,” Harvard coach Jay Weiss said. “He looked good, and he looked strong. In the finals, he controlled the match ... and he wasn’t getting threatened much.”
Earlier in the day, Peppelman received a bye in the first round as a result of his seeding before earning an impressive fall just eight seconds into the match against Virginia Military Institute’s Ted Gottwald. After his quick finish, Peppelman earned a 4-1 decision against No. 5 seed Chip Powell of Appalachian State, who had pinned his first opponent at the 0:40 mark and earned a technical fall in his second-round bout. Peppelman’s three wins brought his collegiate career record to 70-27.
Similarly to Peppelman, No. 2 seed Keith finished in third place last week, but the 133-pounder went one better this weekend, falling in the championship match to No. 1 seed Brian Ortenzio from Penn after being put in an early hole.
“Compared to last weekend, I feel like I just moved significantly better on my feet,” Keith said. “I opened up and just wasn’t nervous about anything. I just went out there and wrestled as hard as I could, and it helped me get one spot better.”
Ortenzio got out to an early 2-0 lead with a takedown, but Keith responded with an escape to bring the score back to 2-1. In the second period, Ortenzio earned a pair of back points to increase his lead to 6-2. Despite Keith’s best efforts to make a comeback, Ortenzio held on for a 6-5 decision over Keith.
The final Crimson squad member to make the finals was No. 2 seed Croy, who lost an overtime matchup to No. 1 seed Andrew Trotman from Appalachian State. The 184-pounder made quick work of his opponents in his first two matches, earning a 10-4 decision over Jon Hartley from Appalachian State and a 12-4 major decision against No. 6 Dan Santoro from Princeton.
In the final, Trotman pushed ahead for an early 4-1 lead, but down, 5-4, Croy gained a critical escape to tie the score and send the matchup into overtime after the third period. Despite the comeback for Croy, Trotman earned a quick takedown just six seconds into sudden victory to claim the championship at 184 pounds.
“It was frustrating just because I thought he wrestled good, smart matches throughout the first three periods,” Weiss said.
Other players who earned spots in the top six were unseeded freshman Joe Barbato and sophomore Paul Ligouri, the No. 3 seed, with both Harvard wrestlers securing fifth-place finishes at 125 pounds and 149 pounds, respectively.
Barbato won by decision in his first two bouts, but No. 1 seed Levi Mele pinned Barbato at the 1:46 mark in the semifinals. In the wrestlebacks, Barbato was pinned again at 1:36 against No. 3 seed Thomas Williams from American before earning a fall of his own at the 0:54 mark against Appalachian State’s Tony Gravely.
Ligouri made an impressive run to the winner’s circle at 149 pounds last weekend but had to settle for fifth place this time around.
In his first two rounds, Ligouri only gave up one point, picking up two major decisions against Appalachian State’s Russ Benner and Princeton’s Luis Ramos. In the quarterfinals, Ligouri lost a tough 7-5 decision to No. 6 seed Kevin Tao from American but pulled out the victory in the fifth-place matchup over No. 5 seed Savva Kostis of Appalachian State.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Saturday evening, the stars were out at Lavietes Pavilion.
While the Harvard men's basketball team was in Los Angeles, Calif., beating up on Loyola Marymount, it was a group of NBA players—including Paul Pierce (making a fashionably late appearance in the first quarter), Rajon Rondo, Kendrick Perkins, Josh Smith, and Rudy Gay—which took to the court and dazzled a sold-out crowd of over 2,000 to benefit local charities SPIN (Serving People In Need), Sojourner House, and Crossroads Family Shelter.
Just days after the players union chose to dissolve itself—putting the 2011-2012 NBA season in doubt—the myriad highlight-reel dunks and long-distance bombs served as a small reminder of what fans would be missing through the upcoming long winter months.
Though his dunks may not have been as thunderous as those of his bouncy teammates, local favorite Jeremy Lin '10 bounced back from a couple early missed layups to nail five deep treys in the third quarter alone, much to the delight of the audience, which included Boston Mayor Thomas Menino. Lin is reportedly in the final stages of signing with an Italian basketball team.
Little defense was played, one foul was called the entire night—much to the incredulity of everyone in the arena—and scorekeeping was suspect, but ultimately, the White team of Kyle Lowry, Marquis Daniels, Jeff Green, Leon Powe, Nate Robinson, and Pierce fell to the Green team of Lin, JaJuan Johnson, Gay, Smith, Perkins, and Rondo by the score of 145-142.
Green said after the game that it was his eighth appearance in a charity game this year. By the looks of it, he'll likely have the opportunity to play in many more.

The Harvard College Hellenic Society is selling baklava outside of the Science Center from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. today in celebration of Thanksgiving.
We at Flyby never knew that there was a connection between Thanksgiving and Greece, but some Googling reveals that the Greeks used to celebrate a holiday called Thesmophoria each November that commemorated earth's natural bounty and yield.
Whatever the case may be about the connection between these two Th-initialed events, the flaky dessert is absolutely delicious and worth a taste (or two).

Can a hundred bucks turn your Dunster walk-through into an Ibiza-worthy nightclub? If you're up for the challenge, check out The Party Fund, an NYC-based company that offers 10 weekly grants of $100 to college students who complete simple promotion tasks for their sponsors.
The brainchild of former Currier Ten-Man resident Daniel "Zak" Tanjeloff '08, The Party Fund is still in its launch period. This week's task, which goes live on Wednesday at 11 p.m., asks students to post a link to NerdWallet.com, a website which aims to match users with credit cards based on their spending habits. Grants will go to the first 10 people who post a two-sentence description of NerdWallet, including a link to its website, on a site with a .edu domain name, although Tanjeloff hopes that future tasks will involve social media.
To collect the grant money, winners must snap a photo of themselves with 10 friends at the funded party, holding signs that declare their love for the sponsor. ("Don't be a smartass and actually take a picture that says 'We love Sponsor,'" The Party Fund website advises.) Once the photo is uploaded, The Party Fund will send a reimbursement check. According to Tanjeloff, one lucky host in Quincy House has already been a recipient of a grant.
Tanjeloff, who remembers the perennial social space discussion from his own days at Harvard, drew his inspiration for The Party Fund from the now-defunct party grants that the Undergraduate Council provided while he was on campus. He sees these small grants as a way that students can utilize existing social spaces unencumbered by financial concerns.
"Obviously, a problem for many college students is they never have enough cash to party the way they want to," Tanjeloff said. "We are trying our best to address that problem."
