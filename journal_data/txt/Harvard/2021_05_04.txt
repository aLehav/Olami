After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Professional basketball player Jeremy Lin ’10 will address the College’s Class of 2021 at this year’s virtual Class Day on May 26, the University announced Monday.
Harvard announced in February it would postpone Commencement Exercises and hold a virtual ceremony in May for the second consecutive year in adherence to public health guidelines. University President Lawrence S. Bacow promised to hold an in-person celebration for members of the Class of 2021 and Class of 2020 once it is safe to do so.
Lin is known for being the first American of Chinese or Taiwanese descent to play in the NBA and the first Asian American to win an NBA championship. As a student at the College, where he studied Economics, Lin played point guard on the men’s basketball team and captained the team during his senior year. He made the All-Ivy League team three times.
“I’m deeply honored to be invited by the Class of 2021 to speak at Class Day,” Lin said in a press release. “This next generation of leaders is stepping into the world at such an unprecedented time, and they have so much potential to help shape a more just and kind society. I’m excited to celebrate this moment with them and share whatever lessons I’ve learned since my time at Harvard.”
After going undrafted in the 2010 NBA Draft, Lin catapulted to international prominence when he led the New York Knicks in a winning turnaround in 2012 — a phenomenon dubbed “Linsanity.” He has since played stints for several other NBA and Chinese Basketball Association teams, and currently plays for the NBA G League’s Santa Cruz Warriors.
Off the court, Lin has also used his platform for philanthropy and advocacy, including donating to Covid-19 relief nonprofits and speaking out against anti-Asian racism. In 2016, Lin donated $1 million to help fund the College’s financial aid program and renovations of Harvard’s basketball arena.
The College’s Senior Class Committee, composed of fourteen senior class marshals, annually selects a Class Day speaker to address graduating undergraduates. Conan C. O’Brien ’85 addressed the Class of 2020 during last year’s virtual commencement activities.
This year’s virtual Class Day will also feature remarks from Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, Harvard Alumni Association President Vanessa W. Liu ’96, and select student speakers. The University-wide graduation ceremony — featuring Ruth J. Simmons, the president of Prairie View A&M University, as Commencement speaker — will take place the following day, May 27.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Organizers from Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard — an activist group calling for Harvard to divest from the fossil fuel industry — met with senior staff members from the office of Massachusetts Attorney General Maura T. Healey ’92 Friday to discuss a legal complaint they filed in March over the University’s investments.
The grievance, filed by Divest Harvard on March 15, alleges that Harvard’s continued investment in fossil fuels violates a provision of the 2009 Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act — a state law that stipulates not-for-profit entities have a duty to invest in line with their charitable missions.
As of February, the University’s fossil fuel holdings are valued at less than two percent of its $41.9 billion endowment.
Five student organizers were joined in the meeting by former Securities and Exchange Commission Commissioner Bevis Longstreth, State Rep. Erika Uyterhoeven, attorney Joseph E. “Ted” Hamilton, and Mothers Out Front co-founder Kelsey D. Wirth ’91, according to a Divest Harvard press release. They met with staff members from the office of the Attorney General’s Charities and Nonprofits Division, Health Care and Fair Competition Bureau, and the Environmental Protection Division, according to the release.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment on the meeting between the Attorney General’s office and divestment activists. A spokesperson from the Attorney General’s office confirmed the meeting took place and was held at the request of the students, but declined to comment further.
Hamilton, a Harvard Law School graduate and co-founder of the Climate Defense Project who helped prepare the complaint, wrote in a statement that the meeting indicated that Healey’s office is taking the complaint seriously.
“During the meeting, members of the office asked several probing questions about our arguments, a promising sign that they are applying close scrutiny to the Corporation’s investments,” Hamilton wrote.
Divest Harvard’s complaint has continued to garner support from elected officials, climate experts, and Harvard affiliates since it was first sent to Healey’s office. The list of signatories expanded to more than 110 by April 13, including seven former members of the Board of Overseers – the University’s second-highest governing body.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow defended Harvard’s fossil fuel investments in a March 18 interview, stating he believes the holdings are “consistent with our charitable mission as well as our fiduciary obligations.”
Bacow referred to a 2020 article co-authored by Harvard Law School professor Robert H. Sitkoff in the Stanford Law Review, which he said offers the “best legal scholarship” on the investment responsibilities of the University and other nonprofits.
The article argues that the duty of trustees to invest with prudence does not and should not require that environmental, social, and governance factors be taken into consideration. Rather, it contends that accounting for these factors in investment decisions is only permissible under American law if their inclusion would directly benefit the investment portfolio “by obtaining better returns with less risk.”
Hamilton cautioned that in order for the activists’ legal complaint to be successful, the Attorney General’s office needs to launch a formal review into Harvard’s investments.
Should a review take place and find Harvard in violation of the Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act, the Attorney General could compel the University to divest its fossil fuel investments.
“The next step is waiting to see whether the office chooses to open a formal investigation based on the information we have provided — a step that we made clear is necessary for the protection of the Harvard community, the Commonwealth, and the planet,” Hamilton added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Twenty-four juniors at Harvard College received notice of their induction into the Alpha Iota Chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, the country’s oldest honor society, in a Monday afternoon email.
The Harvard College chapter of the society, currently headed by History professor Maya R. Jasanoff ’96, selects new members three times each academic year — 24 juniors in the spring, 48 seniors in the fall, and roughly 96 seniors before graduation.
Elected students “must possess a record [of] outstanding scholarly achievement, showing both depth of study and breadth of intellectual interest,” according to the chapter website.
Seventy-nine juniors received notice of their nomination on April 9 and had two weeks to apply, after which committees considered students’ transcripts and letters of recommendation before making their final decision. Candidates also submitted two short essays — one on influential classes they have taken at Harvard, and one on an academic experience that changed their way of thinking — as part of their application.
Most nominated students received all As or all As with one A-, according to Gillian B. Pierce ’88, associate dean for Strategic Initiatives in the Office of Undergraduate Education who currently serves as interim chapter secretary.
While the inductions for junior students are always particularly selective, Jasanoff wrote in an email that the society allowed a greater number of nominations this cycle than in past years and that this year’s pool “had an unusual number of very strong candidates.”
“PBK elections always leave me impressed by the intellectual achievements of Harvard students, but this year more than ever I was awed by the candidates’ resilience, curiosity, and agility,” she wrote.
The number of students selected in each of the three divisions of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences — Social Science, Natural Science, and Humanities — is proportional to the number of students in the class concentrating in that area.
This year’s “Junior 24” features 11 natural science concentrators, 9 social science concentrators, 3 humanities concentrators, and one student with a special concentration.
Economics concentrator Katherine L. Ricca ’22 said she received the email with “just a lot of excitement” while working on a final paper for one of her classes.
“It just feels a lot like a combination of so much effort and so much support from a bunch of different people,” she said.
Siye “Annie” Zhu ’22, a joint concentrator in Math and Computer Science who is also pursuing an A.M. in Statistics, called the induction “a big honor.”
“I feel like if I were to just make getting [a 4.0 GPA] as my priority, I’d be taking easy classes,” she said. “I'm just very grateful that I was still able to be recognized, even though I challenged myself.”
Aaron B. Abai ’22, a concentrator in Molecular and Cellular Biology, said he had been “anxious” this morning as he awaited the email announcing the inductees.
“I did some yoga and then I got back after yoga and checked my email and that was there. And I freaked out for a little bit and called my mom,” Abai said.
“My parents and my family were super, super excited — I think being a first generation college student, we were all a little bit nervous about how college would be for me and my brother,” he said. “Hearing this news was really validating for all of us and really exciting.”
Kelsey Chen ’22, a Social Studies concentrator, wrote that she was “thrilled” to be selected for the society, writing that it was a “huge academic honor.” Chen wrote her parents were also excited when they found out and reacted in a “very cute” way, although they did not initially know what PBK was.
“They are first generation immigrants and, like me, didn’t know what PBK was initially,” she wrote. “They’re actually hilarious—when I first got into Harvard, I texted our family chat and they both responded with a single thumbs up, and that’s how they responded this time too.”
Government concentrator Alexa C. Jordan ’22 said that while she did not know what PBK was before she was nominated, her grandfather and mother were both members of the society and were excited to hear the news Jordan had been selected as a member. Jordan said she feels her family values “academics and intellectual achievement.”
“I feel really blessed to be part of my family in that way,” Jordan said. “My mom has always been someone to cheer me on academically since I was very young. And so I think this meant a lot to both of us and to my whole family.”
The 24 selected students will participate in a virtual induction ceremony over Zoom on May 5 at 5 p.m. and will have an in-person induction ceremony upon returning to campus.
