After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a few days, 4,245 anxious applicants to the Harvard College class of 2016 will receive their admissions decisions. For the first time since the 2006-2007 academic year, these applicants signaled their interest to Harvard by November rather than January, thereby potentially securing a spot at the College and curtailing the ever-dreadful admissions process. In my time at Harvard, I have often wondered what the final days of an admissions cycle look like. I imagine officers are now sizing up comparable candidates: Who has made the most of his 17 or 18 years on earth and his resources throughout high school? Who will most contribute to Harvard’s community and best capitalize on the opportunities on this campus?
Harvard’s short-lived hiatus from Early Action was founded on the belief that an early admissions cycle disadvantaged individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds. Perhaps this break has improved socioeconomic diversity here. Or maybe Harvard lost strong applicants to other institutions, most of which kept their early programs. Harvard’s decision to reinstate its early program was rooted in fear of the latter scenario. Barring a study of this admissions experiment, however, we cannot entirely judge its successes or failures.
But the spirit of this decision was laudable. As Harvard reintroduces early admissions, it should seek additional ways to increase access for applicants from disadvantaged backgrounds. One way the admissions office could do so is by abolishing policies that privilege children of alumni, or legacies. Harvard should pursue this option. The admissions office should not consider legacy status as a criterion for admittance.
Harvard has done an admirable job of making the College an option for students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Its outstanding financial aid program continually improves the affordability of a Harvard education. Current admissions practices ensure that Harvard is more diverse and accessible than the Harvard of our parents’ generation. (I should state that my own parents met as students here.) But by admitting legacy students at the expense of others, Harvard runs the risk of perpetuating inequalities resulting from educational disparities between applicants’ parents. This policy privileges the already advantaged. On average, legacies come from highly educated families and have better access to financial capital, networks, and other opportunities than most non-legacy students. Harvard alumni may know how to game the admissions process better than other parents. If, despite all of these resources, children of alumni still cannot gain admission on their own merit, it is illogical and unethical to offer them a spot based on their legacy status.
As Richard D. Kahlenberg ’85 of The Century Foundation has pointed out, legacy preferences are not a mere tiebreaker between equally capable candidates. Legacy status increases an applicant’s chance of admission by 19.7 percent for a given SAT score range. At the California Institute of Technology, which does not favor legacy applicants, legacies make up a mere 1.5 percent of the student body. At Harvard, 12-13 percent of students are legacies. Obviously, by virtue of having a Harvard-educated parent, legacies may be better qualified than the average high school senior. But it is safe to assume that more legacy students make the admissions cut than deserve it.
Legacies preferences probably reflect Harvard’s legitimate desire to increase alumni donations and improve graduates’ connection to the school. But as Kahlenberg reports, Chad Coffman of Winnemac Consulting recently published a study that found no “causal relationship between legacy-preference policies and total alumni giving at top universities.” Higher levels of giving at institutions with legacy preferences resulted from those schools’ overall wealthier alumni communities, rather than the institutions’ admissions policies themselves. Moreover, schools that removed legacy preferences policies experienced “no measurable reduction in alumni giving.” Even still, alumni donations to Harvard in particular may be tied to such admissions practices. But the added value of admitting otherwise unqualified legacies is unjustifiable through a donation-centric lens alone, especially as the admissions office aims to increase access to Harvard.
The students who replaced legacy admits would not singlehandedly eliminate socioeconomic inequality at Harvard. The application process may always favor students with financial and other resources—individuals who can afford conservatory dance lessons or interesting trips abroad and who know that such experiences will make them stronger candidates for admission. Moreover, some applicants who would receive a spot at Harvard if legacy preferences were abolished may be children of Yale or Stanford or Williams alumni. They might have benefited from backgrounds similar to those of Harvard legacy counterparts, but their admission may come at the expense of students whose families have proved their loyalty here. But for the students of lower socioeconomic backgrounds who might not otherwise gain a coveted spot at Harvard—a place that combines unparalleled educational opportunities with superlative financial aid—the admissions office cannot justify legacy preferences. For applicants to Harvard, a hard-earned acceptance letter is more valuable than any donation could ever be.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As little kids many of us remember imagining ourselves as the princes or princesses in the storybooks our parents or teachers would read to us. I personally imagined I was one of the students travelling to the depths of space or down someone’s esophagus on Ms. Frizzle’s “Magic School Bus.” A student organization on campus, Harvard College Stories for Orphans, was created in 2008 to write and illustrate personalized stories for orphans so they too can have their own ‘happy endings.’
Since its founding nearly four years ago, HCSO has published around 130 books, unique to each child that receives one. Each semester the organization works with a different orphanage, and so far members of HCSO have made books for children in Peru, Poland, the Dominican Republic, South Africa, and most recently, South Korea. The group usually writes books for children ages 5-8, but this past semester, the books have been targeted to 14-17 year olds. In an average semester, around 15-20 members will write and illustrate 15-20 books, depending on the number of children in the orphanage.
HCSO works closely with the different orphanages to make sure that each story is built around a particular child’s name, age, and favorite storybook characters, animals, and toys. A child who wrote that his favorite animal was a lion got a story about a boy who lived with a circus and freed two lions being treated unfairly by the evil lion tamer. Another story HCSO has done is about a boy who was sucked into the world of his own written story and saved a planet of banished children from an evil emperor about to destroy them with the power his pencil gave him. Some of the completed books have even been hand-delivered by HCSO members who volunteer in the orphanages that they have written for. Two current members will be travelling to South Korea this J-term to volunteer and deliver books to the orphanage HCSO has been writing for this past semester.
Harvard College Stories for Orphans has attracted a wide range of students looking to find a ‘philanthropic’ outlet to their creative abilities - whether it be in the form of writing, drawing, painting, photography, or research for the books.  A new member to HCSO, Margot Leger ’13, decided to lend her artistic skills to Stories for Orphans because she wanted a way to share the love she felt when her parents would read to her at bedtime when she was little. “Even though children in orphanages don't have parents to read to them, I still believe that books can create this sense of warmth and care,” Leger says. “I love drawing for HCSO as I feel that the individual stories that we create make children feel special and important.”
Current Co-President of HCSO Annie Li ’13, recalls “at the first introduction meeting I went to, we went around the room and named our favorite children's book. It reminded me how much reading meant to me as a child and how great it would be to provide that to a child in need. HCSO's mission of using these storybooks to foster an early love for reading and to remind each child that they are special is also something that I truly believe we do. A lot of the times, these books are one of the only personal items that these children get to call their own.”
At the beginning of each semester, the group sends out applications for writing and illustrating spots. HCSO also organizes readings to kids at the COOP, so even if creativity isn’t your strong point, there is still a need for good storytellers. The group is planning on working with a larger orphanage of around 60 kids in Ethiopia in the spring, and so will need more students to contribute. While we may sometimes find ourselves caught up in our own “storylines” of papers, internship applications and social events. HCSO offers a way to help out while allowing us to tap into our ‘childish’ sides.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s pretty self-evident to anyone at Harvard that the world revolves around the Ivy League. Students at the best universities go on to cure cancer, dominate Wall Street, and occupy the White House (or, lately, to Occupy Wall Street). That’s why Harvard and other universities lobby for higher education—with which we mean more money for colleges like ours.
In the fiscal year of 2010, the federal government awarded Harvard $600 million for research, the kind of funding that strengthens our science departments and promotes America’s long-term competitiveness on the global stage. Yet there’s a kind of higher education that may be more important to America’s future than anything in the Ivy League. It’s the community college.
Student attendance at community colleges has surged during the last decade. Enrollment now stands at 8.2 million, a 2.2 million hike in the last two years. In Texas, 79 percent of students who enroll in a public university begin at a community college. Even during the recession, the national rate of enrollment at community colleges leapt forward at a pace three or four times greater than that of four year institutions.
For all our Nobel Prizes, it’s increasingly clear that investment in higher education gets the most bang for the buck when it’s put into community colleges, not Ivies. There are two reasons why community colleges should be a top priority for anyone who cares about higher education.
First, they draw in people who otherwise would never see a blackboard again. Given that those who receive a community college certificate go on to earn 15 percent more than those with no college education, the benefits that young people would gain from the expansion of community colleges are enormous. (We need not mention benefits, like crime reduction, that society would gain.) Four-year institutions, on the other hand, use an admissions process that mostly shifts around otherwise college-bound students among various slots. America needs to net fresh pupils into the educational loop—we’ve gone from the world’s first to 16th in the proportion of young people earning a higher education—and community colleges offer a bridge to university.
Second, improved community colleges will create a more diverse workforce and help close the achievement gap between the races. Currently, 32 percent of Asians and whites hold four-year degrees, while only 15 percent of blacks and Hispanics do. One way to narrow this divide is to bolster the institutions that have the best track record in reaching blacks and Hispanics, and those are community colleges. More than half of all Hispanics choose them over four-year colleges, and almost half of all blacks do. Investing heavily in these two-year colleges will arm members of minority groups, who tend to be poorer, with greater skills—thereby chipping away at both the achievement and income gaps.
Yet funding for community colleges is seriously absent. The Brookings Institution estimated that the federal government traditionally spends on community colleges one tenth—or $2 billion—of the amount it provides four-year colleges. Presumably, this lag in funding is due in part to the fact that U.S. presidents and senators neither send their kids to community colleges nor pick advisors from their faculty, something that reflects a daunting myopia in the political consciousness.
President Obama, to be sure, recognizes the importance of two-year programs. In 2009, he set forth a $12 billion initiative to boost graduation rates in community colleges. That federal funding will dampen tuition costs and attract students. Still, 64 percent of college presidents don’t foresee Obama realizing his goal to produce 5 million more community college grads by 2020. For that aspiration ever to come to fruition, government and donors will have to rethink the way in which they provide money.
Granted, community colleges often don’t provide a great education. Their graduates are less likely to occupy top spots in the nation or world. But one lesson of American history is that sometimes mass education is more important than elite education. In the 19th century, European countries offered first-rate schools for the upper class but scrimped on education for all. In contrast, the United States promoted mass education—first, widespread literacy and primary education, and then in the 20th century high school education for the great majority of children, and finally higher education for a large share of the public. America’s best schools were often inferior to Europe’s best schools, but what turned out to matter most was that mass education was better in America than in Europe—and that gave us the jump on economic productivity and technological innovation.
So, members of Congress and Harvard donors, I have a suggestion: We all want Harvard to get its fair share of funding, but your wealth may do as much at our nation’s least prestigious institutions, the humble community colleges we’re all glad we’re not attending. You might not get a marble library named after you, but you might give a kid who worked odd-jobs throughout high-school a coveted shot at becoming a mechanic, or an orphaned teen with a knotty childhood a fresh start.
And trust me, Harvard will survive.

As classes wind down for the semester and Harvard students prepare to head home or travel over J-term, we have gained the opportunity to eat out—and to reflect on the multitude of ethnic food in Boston.
After all, part of Harvard’s appeal is its location. And the city of Boston has much more to offer than 100,000 college students and picturesque views of the Public Garden. Boston has become increasingly diverse in the last 20 years, and its vibrant immigrant communities have sparked both culturally diverse neighborhoods and a hugely varied range of culinary options. Venturing into Boston to experience the ethnic food scene of various neighborhoods is an excellent way for both Harvard students and other Boston residents to gain quite literally a taste of many different cultures and experience an easily accessible and highly rewarding sample of Boston’s diversity.
In recent years, an increasing global awareness and respect for different cultures and ethnicities has led to a heightened esteem for immigrants in the United States. After centuries of pressure on immigrant communities to assimilate into an “American” way of life, most recent immigrants to the United States feel more comfortable than ever continuing their own cultural practices as they integrate to life stateside. For example, as anyone walking through a major city like Boston will quickly see, the reality of many immigrants speaking languages other than English or wearing attire representing their cultures creates a vibrant and diverse urban community. For us, food is one of the most important cultural experiences to have flourished as a result of growing immigrant communities, across the United States and especially in Boston.
The demographics of Boston are indeed changing rapidly. According to a report on the demographics of Boston available through the Mayor’s Office of New Bostonians, Boston’s immigrant population grew rapidly in the last two decades. Although the most common ancestries of Boston residents remain Irish and Italian, the number of Irish and Italian people in Boston has decreased recently, while the number of people with Puerto Rican, Chinese, and Salvadoran ancestries increased dramatically. The majority of new immigrants to Boston since 1990 are from Asia and Latin America, especially Brazil, and Boston’s population also now includes lots of Haitians, Cape Verdeans, and Vietnamese.
Boston’s many neighborhoods each feature different populations. The community most famous to Boston tourists, the North End, has long sported a wide variety of Italian restaurants. However, the quality of the North End’s restaurants has suffered as the neighborhood caters increasingly to tourists attracted by the fame of Boston’s “Little Italy.” This unfortunate deterioration makes it even more important for Bostonians searching for ethnic food to look to other neighborhoods.
Indeed, many other neighborhoods and neighboring towns have witnessed the establishment of continuously growing immigrant communities. Chinatown, a historically Chinese community, has blocks full of Chinese, Japanese, and Vietnamese restaurants, bakeries, and tea shops. Brookline boasts rows of Kosher restaurants, catering to its sizable Jewish population, including many residents of Russian and Israeli immigrant backgrounds. East Boston, traditionally Italian, now has a predominantly Latino population; it boasts a number of Salvadoran as well as Mexican and general Hispanic restaurants. Dorchester holds dozens of Vietnamese, Jamaican, and Haitian restaurants owned by its own immigrant populations. Closer to home, Allston and Brighton, North Cambridge, and Somerville each have multifarious immigrant communities and excellent restaurants of their own. A good variety and quality of Middle Eastern food can be found a short walk down Massachusetts Avenue to Central Square.
No matter where we travel in Boston, we find hugely diverse and multicultural communities. As hungry college students, we believe that one of the best ways to experience Boston’s vibrant immigrant cultures comes through food. Venturing out of Harvard Square and experimenting beyond forays to the North End to eat provides an important—and delicious—perspective on the city of Boston.

At some point in the process of developing a start-up, every small business owner has to dedicate themselves to their new trade. For Brenna S. Haysom ’00, that meant four to five hangovers a week for months as she attempted to hone in on the perfect flavor for her new drug.
Finally, that work has paid off, and Blowfish, a hangover cure, is now being offered online and is already being sold in some stores in New York.
“I was a real guinea pig,” Haysom said. “Hopefully the rest of humanity will reap the benefits of that.”
Haysom left Harvard and took a familiar path into finance but soon decided that she wanted to run her own business. Haysom returned to Cambridge to attend Harvard Business School, graduating in 2006. During her second stint at Harvard, she began researching potential hangover cures.
“I was a lot more social when I was in business school than as an undergrad,” Haysom said. “[Hangovers were] something I started doing a lot of research around, just in my own personal habits. I started trying a whole bunch of the other hangover so-called cures and didn’t find any of them to do anything. I did more research and came up with the idea that you need a painkiller, caffeine, and something to settle your stomach. Just from more trial-and-error, we came up with that formulation. I left business school but I really wanted to run my own business and I came up with the idea to do this.”
Haysom left her firm, Apollo Global Management in 2010 to found Rally Labs and pursue a hangover cure full-time.
“Everyone over age 45 thought I was crazy,” Haysom said. “My parents thought I was crazy. When I told people I was leaving my firm, I think they thought I was crazy. The people who knew more about it and what I was trying to do, which is make this really reliable ... hangover product were all super-encouraging and they believed in the product from the beginning, which was great.”
The final product created by Rally Labs includes caffeine and aspirin to give the consumer energy and relieve pain and antacids to help the stomach recover from the alcohol. The product comes in the form of an effervescent tablet.
With the product created, the young business is turning to address questions of marketing and distribution.
“Right now our big challenge is national distribution,” said Erin M. Anderson, Haysom’s assistant. “Right now we are getting tons of interest from our website and our e-commerce platform, but we need to be in stores, bottom line. We are in talks with a lot of different stores. The major national retailers plan for years in advance, so it’s a little bit slow going.”
Anderson has been with the company since the summer after she graduated from Yale University in 2011.
“At first I was skeptical,” Anderson said of her first days at the company. “I was thinking, ‘Hangover cure? Really?’ But [Haysom] explained why there is a market for it and why this particular formulation is going to be successful. She addressed a lot of my concerns. It’s clear that she has thought all of it through.”
Since then, Anderson has become a believer.
“I’ve definitely put it to good use since I’ve got here,” she said. “It really does work. It’s great to come into work on a rough morning and have an unlimited supply of Blowfish here.”

China will eclipse the U.S. as the world’s largest economy in 2016, History professor Niall Ferguson said in a lecture Wednesday afternoon.
In his talk at Littauer, Ferguson also responded to claims by Pankaj Mishra, an author who negatively reviewed Ferguson’s new book, “Civilization: The West and the Rest,” in the London Review of Books. In his review, Mishra described the book as racist in describing Europe’s dominance over other continents, such as Africa and Asia, and as nostalgic for those days of European power.
Ferguson said those claims are “clearly false.”
“The argument of the book, that has been seriously misrepresented by at least two reviews ... is that it was distinctive complexes of ideas and institutions that arose in the Western world that did not arise elsewhere that led to the Great Divergence,” Ferguson said. This explanation is “diametrically opposite to the view 100 years ago that success was race-related.”
“With the right institutions and the right incentives, any group of people, regardless of race, regardless of physiology, can experience wealth and power,” Ferguson added.
Ferguson explained that the inspiration behind his book is to understand the “single biggest problem that economic historians” face: Why a small sub-population from Europe rose to achieve the level of power it had.
“Why did these people become richer, healthier, and more powerful than the rest of mankind?” Ferguson said.
He explained six features—what he referred to as “killer apps”—unique to post-medieval European civilization that facilitated Europe’s last 500 years of economic strength.
These “apps”—a phrase Ferguson used to entice younger readers and explained as critical features that Europe “downloaded” into the “programming” of its civilization—include political and economic competition, the Scientific Revolution of the 1600s, rule of law, modern medicine, consumerism, and “work ethic.”
But as “resterners” are rapidly catching up in wealth and power, Ferguson called the current day “The Great Reconvergence.” For example, The average American citizen, 20 times wealthier than the average Chinese citizen in 1978, is now only 5 times wealthier.
“The rest of the world has downloaded the killer apps,” Ferguson said. “The West has been deleting them, or at least has not been updating the software.”
But Ferguson makes clear he is in no way saying that the development of non-Western civilization is undesirable.
“That hundreds of millions of people have left poverty is without question a good thing,” Ferguson said. “The deterioration of Western institutions is what concerns me.”
In particular, Ferguson cited shortcomings in Western educational systems, especially in the sciences; decreasing levels in manufacturing productivity in America; and an unfulfilling health care system.
Chandrika Lakshminarayan, a student in the Kennedy school’s mid-career masters’ program and a former senior writer for CNN International,  pushed Ferguson on his argument during the lecture.
She noted that many of the advantages that Ferguson credits to 16th century Europe, such as science, medicine, and governing institutions, were in fact present in China, India, and Persia some 3,000 years ago.
Ferguson agreed, saying “Please, make no mistake, the book starts from the premise of Western backwardness,” Ferguson said. “The West benefited from non-Western learning.” He also added that once Europeans initiated these ideas they developed them further and added new components, leading to the widely-known results.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Six Harvard professors representing a diverse mix of disciplines convened in Sanders Theatre last night to present a joint lecture on global climate change, and the critical role that Harvard should play in alleviating it.
The event, entitled “Harvard Thinks Green,” was organized by the Harvard Office for Sustainability and was based on the format of TED talks—to educate the audience of approximately 250 about the most pressing facets of the global warming crisis.
Professor of Biological Oceanography James J. McCarthy kicked off the event, speaking about current climate conditions and measures in place to combat global warming. According to McCarthy, the New York Times recently reported that 2010 showed the largest ever reported jump in global carbon emissions—5.9 percent. However, McCarthy also cited examples of successful incremental plans, such as Harvard’s goal to reduce its emissions by 30 percent from 2006 to 2016. He stressed the importance of Harvard as a trendsetter.
“Small changes, that often have no impact on our lifestyles, add up to significant change,” McCarthy said.
Law School Professor Richard J. Lazarus criticized Washington’s failure to pass comprehensive climate change legislation and urged Harvard students to innovate environmentally within the private sector. “Don’t just occupy Wall Street—become Wall Street,” said Lazarus. “Real profits can be made by being green.”
Lazarus also criticized what he sees as short-sighted political stagnation inhibiting global warming initiatives, and said that Congress is ill suited to passing long term, incremental legislation.
For example, according to Lazarus, in 2011 President Obama has discussed global warming in just one speech, in contrast to 73 speeches that touched on the subject in 2010.
“Global climate change has become the Lord Voldemort of issues—the problem that even the President dare not name,” said Lazarus, eliciting a round of laughter from the audience.
Dovetailing with McCarthy’s points, Harvard Business School Professor Robert S. Kaplan discussed the “leadership impasse” that has led to inaction in Washington, and praised the efforts of Harvard administrators such as President Drew Faust to lead by example.
HBS Professor of Environmental Management Rebecca Henderson provided an economic view of the situation, saying that capitalism must eventually have a significant impact on solving global warming. According to Henderson, despite the difficulties that come with decarbonizing the private sector and the conflict that will arise between social value and profitability, there is reason to be optimistic about the effects business could have on the climate crisis.
Students were appreciative of the perspectives the program raised.
“The talks were really intriguing,” said Jonathan D. Young ’15.
“It was awesome to see so many perspectives,” added HLS student Lung-Kuan Wang. “It really helped me see how we as students can create real changes.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When most Harvard Law School students study, they do it from the safety and comfort of a classroom or library. Most look forward to seeing the law in action, not back on it. Former police officers Adam W. Braskich, Sean K. Driscoll, and Alan W. Ezekiel are not most Harvard Law students.
“People tell me I’m the calmest law student they’ve ever met,” says Driscoll, who is in his second year at the Law School. “Being a police officer puts everything in perspective.”
While the three men come from different backgrounds, each carries with him the unique experience of having applied the law in real life, before being asked to do it in a classroom or courthouse.
“[Being a police officer] has given me a very different perspective,” says Ezekiel, who is in his second year at the Law School. “You have a much better sense for what the law looks like in practice.”
BRINGING PRUDENCE TO JURISPRUDENCE
All three former police officers agree that their experience enforcing law on the street has influenced their study of it.
“Most of the people in the class haven’t actually seen this,” Ezekiel says. “Their perspective is very academic and in some ways a little naive.”
Ezekiel says that being a police officer showed him that many legal situations are far more complicated than they appear to be to the average law student.
“Other students see things as having fairly simple solutions,” Ezekiel says. “In the real world, the problems come in groups. People have a lot of problems that put them in these situations. People are impossibly complicated.”
I. Glenn Cohen, an assistant professor of law, says that Driscoll offers “real world insight” into how law is detected and prosecuted. As an example, Cohen pointed to a class in which Driscoll once walked his fellow students through a video of a high-speed chase that was attached to a Supreme Court opinion, explaining the police officers’ training and what could have influenced their behavior.
ON THE JOB
All in Cambridge now, Driscoll, Braskich, and Ezekiel each hail from different parts of the country.
Driscoll, who is from Queens, N.Y., majored in political science and English at the University of Virginia where he , before teaching in the United Kingdom for a year. After that, he joined in the New York City Urban Fellows Program, which introduces college students and graduates to public service.
Driscoll says that his path to being a police officer was a “bit random,” as during the program he was working at the New York Police Department in a white-collar capacity.
“I was always interested in law,” Driscoll says. “I signed up for the LSAT and didn’t even take it.”
Driscoll says he wanted a “hands-on, bottom-up experience.” For him, that meant working as a uniformed street cop and then in the NYPD’s counterterrorism unit for over four years.
Braskich, who grew up in suburban Illinois, says that since he always knew he wanted to be a police officer, inspired by his uncle, a detective. He says he wanted a professional life that was more “meaningful and exciting” than his father’s, noting that his father held an office job.
As an undergrad at the University of Maryland, College Park, Braskich, decided to add a philosophy major to his major in criminal justice because he found the subject interesting.
After graduating, Braskich spent over three years in the Baltimore Police Department.
Ezekiel took yet another different road to the profession. Born in San Diego, he graduated from Stanford University with a degree in computer science before working as a software developer for Microsoft for over four years.
Deciding he wanted a more “people-oriented job,” Ezekiel moved to Renton, Wash., where he worked as a street cop for more than eight years, most of which, Ezekiel says, was spent on the graveyard shift.
Being a police officer, Ezekiel says he found an ethical and human component that software engineering was missing.
“There’s not always a right answer” as a cop, Ezekiel says.
Among their memorable moments on the job, both Driscoll and Braskich declined to recall particularly dangerous or violent situations.
Driscoll said that he didn’t want to tell “war stories,” since some cops have been through much worse, but added that “I saw all sort of awfulness.”
According to the Baltimore Sun, Braskich was off-duty when he opened fire on and successfully chased down two armed robbers in December of 2009, on the day before his LSAT exam. He received a Bronze Star from his police commissioner for his actions.
“What he did exemplified incredibly brave police work,” says Sergeant Jeffrey G. Boettcher of the Baltimore Police Department, who supervised Braskich during his time on the force.
Braskich emphasized that such situations were unusual.
“I’ve been in car chases and foot chases and dealt with people with guns,” Braskich says. “But that’s atypical. It’s not what police work is about. It’s about forging relationships with members of the community [and] gaining trust so that they can come to us.”
THE LAW’S ALLURE
While on the job, all three men said that they had a noticeably greater interest in the law than their fellow police officers.
“I found that I loved talking to the prosecutor about the law itself,” Driscoll says. “I loved the whole job. [But] I found that I was really fascinated when I got to go to court.”
Braskich voiced similar sentiments.
“What interested me most was the law,” Braskich says. “I love memorizing all the different statutes and learning the procedural rules. It’s like a puzzle.”
Sara Gross, a Baltimore prosecutor who worked with Braskich, agrees.
“He’s the only officer I’ve ever met who read case law for fun—more than most lawyers actually,” Gross says.
Braskich recalls that seeing lawyers use the same techniques of “logic and argumentation” that he learned as a philosophy major helped solidify his interest.
“The idea of mastering the law and working with law enforcement ... it all sounds exciting,” Braskich says. “Being in court I felt kind of jealous.”
Ezekiel says he was attracted to the legal profession because he thinks that lawyers have a greater ability to have a wide-spread impact.
“Police officers make a large difference with whom they work,” Ezekiel says. “But broader impact is harder.”
Both Driscoll and Braskich said that they thought Harvard was an especially good school for learning law practically. “The reason Harvard Law was my top choice, besides the prestige, is that there’s a balance of academic excellence and real-world experience,” Braskich says. “These are lawyers who’ve walked the walk.”
LOOKING AHEAD
Driscoll and Braskich both say that after graduation they want to be prosecutors, perhaps on the federal level.
Ezekiel says that he did not want to speak specifically about his plans for fear of compromising his future chances, but did note that he thinks that his experience as a police officer will serve him well.
“For some types of law, it wouldn’t help at all,” Ezekiel says. “[But] for a lot of legal jobs, people skills are key. And that is largely what police officers do.”
Driscoll says that prosecution’s draw, for him, was a chance for him to continue to serve the public.
“I felt that a prosecutor could do a lot of good,” Driscoll says. “I really respected that ones I worked with [in the Manhattan District Attorney’s office].”
Braskich says that being a prosecutor will give him the chance to “help law enforcement officers do their jobs more effectively.”
“From experience we’ve had a lot of cases where we know we had the right defendant and the evidence didn’t come across clearly,” Braskich says. “The prosecutor might have helped the judge or jury see what the truth was.”
Boettcher, the police sergeant, expects Braskich’s experience as a police officer to contribute to his skill as a prosecutor.
“When you put the two together, I think it’s an unbeatable combination if you do it right,” Boettcher says. “It definitely makes you a well-rounded person in that respect.”
Gross, a prosecutor herself, echoes Boettcher’s prediction.
“I think he’ll be fantastic at it,” she says. “I think having the street experience and applying it in the courtroom is good. He might put me out of a job.”
Braskich says that at some point, he’d like to return to Baltimore, pointing out that Harvard graduates tend to “congregate” in cities like New York and Washington.
“Long-term I’d like to serve a community like the one I served as a police officer in Baltimore,” Braskich says. “I think it’s a city that needs more talent in public service. That’s how I can do the most good.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Whether it be getting to know their students over a plate of Spanakopita Turnovers in the dining hall, grabbing a quick bite at one of 14 retail locations operated by Harvard University Dining Services, or meeting with their colleagues at an eatery in the Square, Harvard professors have many dining options, both on and off campus.
Professor Steven R. Levitsky, for example, said he has eaten a lot of popcorn chicken lately.
Levitsky, who teaches Government 20, a popular introductory comparative politics course with about 350 enrollees this semester, said he arranges a weekly group lunch in the undergraduate dining hall to get to know his students better.
“Office hours are great, but these lunches are an excellent way for me to meet the students and try to get my fingers on their pulses,” he said.
Levitsky said he decided to hold student lunches when he realized that too often, he would be walking through the Harvard Yard and passing by his students without even knowing they are in his class.
“It’s very difficult to teach if you don’t know anything about what’s going on inside the head of your students,” he said, adding that the lunches provide him with some sense of what the students care about.
According to Levitsky, between 8 and 10 students are selected to join him for lunch on a first come, first served basis.
“Students with BlackBerries usually win,” Levitsky said.
On other days, Levitsky said he either brings leftovers from home or buys sandwiches from the CGIS Café. Though he tries not to eat in front of the computer, Levistky said he sometimes has to finish his lunch in his office while catching up on emails because “my day is so packed.”
Associate Professor of Chemistry and Chemical Biology Alan Saghatelian eats in the Bauer Café between two and three times a week due to its proximity to his office. He said he usually gets premade sandwiches, a bowl of soup, and chips, which he brings to the office to eat while checking his emails.
According to HUDS spokesperson Crista Martin, all members of Harvard community and their guests can dine at any of the 14 HUDS-operated retail locations on campus, which range from small coffee bar style venues to full cafes with breakfast, soup, salad, sandwiches, and hot entrees.
“With locations scattered around campus, there’s always a café nearby,” Martin said. “Retail cafes are specifically designed to forge community by offering menus with broad appeal to the local customer base at hours that best meet the needs of that local audience.”
In addition to these cafes, professors can also dine at the Harvard Faculty Club, which features a fine dining restaurant and a meeting space Harvard affiliates and their guests.
“The Faculty Club is self-operated, though we are both divisions of Harvard Campus Services and often work collaboratively, sharing some support resources,” Martin said.
However, Levitsky said the Harvard Faculty Club is not his most frequent lunch spot unless he is meeting a visitor.
“I’m too intimidated by the Faculty Club. I haven’t tied a tie since Bar Mitzvah,” he said, referring to the formal atmosphere of the Faculty Club.
Likewise, Saghatelian said he goes to the Faculty Club only when there is a guest or a speaker, and prefers to dine out in the Harvard Square if he is meeting someone.
Saghatelian said his favorite restaurants in the Square are Harvest, Border Café, and Cambridge 1. Saghatelian said he visits Harvest every other week with his colleague, David R. Liu, also a professor in the chemistry department.
“We have been to a lot of different places, but Harvest has one of the best food,” he said. “We can also get a quick lunch if we sit at the bar.”
Perhaps surprisingly, Saghatelian said he and his colleagues do not talk about work when eating out, but about TV shows, personal lives, and sports.
“It’s a good mix of just being friends and colleagues,” he said.
For History Professor Emma Rothschild, going home for lunch is an option she can enjoy because she lives close to campus. She said she usually picks up to-go food from eateries in the square because she does not cook much except on weekends, especially since all her children are grown up.
“I go to Felipe’s, Chipotle, or Qdoba about once a week to get the rice and beans,” Rothschild said.
When she stays on campus, Rothschild often meets with visitors from outside of Harvard or has lunch with the teaching fellows. For example, her Thursday lunches are reserved for the postdoctoral fellows. She said the Center for History and Economics gets food catered from Thai or Chinese restaurants. When she has visitors, Rothschild said she goes to Harvest or Casablanca.
According to Martin, students can invite professors, faculty, or staff to eat with them in the dining hall at any meal, any day of the week through the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Student/Faculty Dining Program. This is in addition to the biannual Faculty Dinner that each House and Annenberg hosts.
“Nourishment is important, but lunch time is also an opportunity to sit down with someone face to face and interact with either friends, colleagues, or students,” Levitsky said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over 350 people gathered in Science Center D Wednesday for Occupy Harvard’s first “teach-in,” a series of eight lectures that spanned about four and a half hours.
The teach-in drew speakers affiliated with Harvard—including the Law and Kennedy Schools—and one professor each from Boston College and New York University. The event garnered a crowd of students, Cambridge residents, and Occupy Boston members, in addition to people watching a live stream online.
The event was hosted outside of Harvard Yard’s gates to encourage people without Harvard affiliation to attend. Since Occupy Harvard erected their encampment in the Yard, Harvard administrators have restricted access inside the Yard.
One of the lecturers, Harvard History Professor John Womack Jr. ’59, conducted a short poll to determine the demographics of the audience during his lecture.
According to Womack’s poll, about a third of the audience said they were over thirty, a third said they were graduate students, and a third said they were not in school, but working for pay or unemployed. Roughly a fourth of the audience also said they were students from various universities, including Harvard.
“It was interesting to me that the audience was so mixed,” Womack wrote in an email, “I had figured it would be mostly students, Harvard students; maybe earlier in the day it was.”
Prachi Sanghavi, a Harvard graduate student, Pforzheimer House tutor, and one of the event’s organizers, stressed the importance of dialogue within the Occupy movement and said the idea of generating dialogue was one of the things that drove Occupy Harvard to create the event.
“A lot of [dialogue] has been happening on campus, formally through University sponsored events and informally in dining halls, among people who both support Occupy Harvard and not,” Sanghavi wrote in an email.
She said that the event created a situation where people could talk about those things.
“It was educational, but in an informal setting so that both the presenters and audience could interact more comfortably.”
Kennedy School Professor Richard Parker said he agreed to participate in the event because he “was invited” and not necessarily as a stand for the Occupy Harvard movement. He said that the Occupy Harvard was an “important” part of the Occupy movement as a whole and that he was “sympathetic to the goals of addressing the state of inequality.”Other professors, however, were more willing to get behind the movement.
“I agreed to talk because the questions the 99-one [percent] agitation has raised in public—equality and justice, in the USA and elsewhere—seem to me to need all the attention any sensible human adult can give them,” Womack said.
Sanghavi said that she was satisfied with the event and emphasized the eagerness of many professors to participate even though some were unable to due to conflicts. She said that they chose professors based on “people’s schedules and our own time constraints with the room.”
“This is a first baby step in a long process,” Sanghavi said. “With this, we wanted to spark dialogue by bringing people into a room where they could hear thinkers and experts speak about a range of issues related with economic and political inequalities, and most importantly, ask questions.”

BOSTON—As a midnight deadline for protesters at Occupy Boston to leave their encampment at Dewey Square came and went, Boston Police did not move in during the early hours on Friday to enforce an ultimatum issued by Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino that protesters had to leave the square.
Menino’s ultimatum came on the heels of a decision by a Superior Court judge to not issue an order that would have prevented police from removing protesters from the square. But one hour after the deadline, no confrontations in the camp were seen, and Boston Police Superintendent William Evans announced to the crowd that police would not clear the camp tonight.
“We’re continuing to work with [the protesters] ... and hopefully come to a good conclusion where we don’t have any confrontations and there are no arrests,” Evans said, according to the Associated Press.
Around 80 Harvard affiliates joined Occupy protesters, and as midnight struck, protesters continued to chant, sing, and dance around what remains of the Occupy Boston encampment.
Though the police did not move in, the threat of police action took a toll on the encampment on Thursday, as many protestors moved out. Police handed out trespass notices to protesters and taped them to tents in the afternoon, warning dwellers to leave the premises by midnight, according to Occupy Harvard supporter and member of The Crimson editorial board Sandra Y.L. Korn ’14.
Organizers also removed a significant amount of supplies and materiel from the encampment, fearing that it would be destroyed in the police action. Food and medical tents, as well as other valuables, were packed and stored at an undisclosed location for safekeeping. Mud, instead of tents, filled the encampment.
“The infrastructure is valuable and worth saving,” said Steven Squibb, an Occupy Boston supporter. “The resources are worth holding on to because we plan on being a movement for a long time.”
Squibb added that throughout the day homeless people were directed to shelters and similar locations to ensure their safety.
Occupy Boston is one of the last remaining encampments of a protest movement that has sought to highlight growing levels of income inequality in the United States. Around the country, police have in recent weeks evicted protesters from their encampments in major metropolitan areas.
But with the deadline passed and police cautiously observing at a distance, Occupy Boston supporters flooded Atlantic Ave., which is adjacent to the square, and began to dance, chanting “This is what democracy looks like” and “Occupy, shut it down, Boston is a people’s town.”
Earlier in the day protesters proposed a massive dance party as a way to end the occupation, which began on Sept. 30. The idea was debated during a general assembly on Thursday afternoon but did not pass.
Twenty minutes before the midnight deadline, organizers informed protesters that they had the option of either forming a human chain to protect the encampment and risk getting arrested or avoid arrest by protesting across the street.
Midnight struck and organizers told protesters to follow a brass band playing earlier around the tent city’s edge while other protesters formed a human chain against the expected police action.
According to Jeff K. Bridges, a chaplain in training at the Harvard Divinity School, about ten chaplains at the protest were willing to be arrested.
“We are here to be a calming presence for those here and the police officers,” Bridges said.
Wearing white albs, a long, white priest’s garment, the chaplains unwilling to be arrested formed a circle adjacent to the encampment and began to sing “Shalom My Friends.”
After the singing, one Harvard chaplain stepped up on a platform and shouted that by coincidence her friends supporting the movement wanted to get married at that moment. Reverend Stephanie Spellers from Boston’s Cathedral Church of St. Paul tied the knot in a short ceremony conducted with “the people’s mic,” a communal act of call and repeat that has become a hallmark of the movement.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Dec. 11 at 3:50 p.m.
Three people were shot and killed in a domestic altercation in west Cambridge about two miles from the Quad on Friday night, according to Cambridge Police Department spokesperson Daniel M. Riviello.
The Middlesex District Attorney’s office announced hours later that the murder suspect had been found dead of an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound.
John Brosnahan, a former Bedford, Mass., police officer, allegedly killed three members of his family in his Cambridge home, according to police statements.
His body was found by police along the Charles River about a mile and a half from Harvard Stadium, at 1400 Soldiers Field Rd. in Brighton.
Police had been pursuing Brosnahan for several hours after responding to gunshots on Grove Street, a thoroughfare near Fresh Pond, at 6:40 p.m, according to Riviello.
The Cambridge Chronicle reported that Brosnahan’s victims were his mother-in-law and two brothers-in-law, ages 52 and 63.
Cara O’Brien, a spokesperson for the District Attorney’s office, said that the victims’ names will not be released until family members identify their bodies.
“This is another horrific example of domestic violence, a familial incident leading to three dead persons in that house,” District Attorney Gerard T. Leone ’85 said in a press conference after the murders. “We know there were disputes leading up to this, however, nothing obviously which would lead anyone to believe that something of this magnitude would occur.... We understand that the disputes were ongoing over some time and that they all related to the domestic situation.”
According to the Chronicle, Brosnahan served as a police officer for 28 years, retiring in 2000.
Harvard University Police Department spokesperson Steven G. Catalano wrote in an email shortly after the three murders occurred that HUPD monitored the situation but was not involved in the investigation. He noted that the shooting took place “a significant distance from campus.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
STORRS, Conn.—Much has been made of the University of Connecticut’s elite guard duo of Jeremy Lamb and Shabazz Napier, but Thursday night at Gampel Pavilion, it was the Huskies frontcourt that did in the Harvard men’s basketball team.
UConn, led by forwards Andre Drummond and Alex Oriakhi, controlled the interior all night, outrebounding the Crimson, 35-28, and outscoring its opponents in the paint, 30-18.
Co-captain forward Keith Wright, who entered the contest averaging a team-best 11.3 points per game, finished with just nine points on 3-of-10 shooting, his second worst shooting performance of the year.
The 6’8 forward struggled to get touches in the early going, as UConn’s physical frontcourt and aggressive guard play made it difficult for the Crimson to get the ball inside and run its traditional inside-out offense.
In the first half, Wright was held to just three shot attempts, including one 10-footer, and was unable to find the bottom of the net. Wright got more touches in the second frame, shooting 3-of-7 from the field and getting to the line four times.
“Certainly what they can do with their size on the backboard limited our effectiveness around the goal,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “We didn’t get much of anything easy around the basket, which is probably going to happen to a lot of teams when they face this basketball team with their size and athleticism.”
On the other end, the Huskies—and particularly Drummond—posed matchup problems for the Crimson. Drummond, a 6’10 rookie projected to go among the top five picks in the 2012 NBA draft, was simply too athletic for the Crimson, scoring 12 points on five dunks.
“That’s one of the best stats we’ve had all year,” UConn coach Jim Calhoun said of Drummond’s five dunks. “We don’t want to try to finesse. When you’re as big and strong as him, finesse doesn’t come into the picture.”
Drummond’s final dunk—an alley-oop that put the Huskies ahead by 15 with 6:54 to play—was so powerful that the shotclock on the top of the backboard was knocked off its base and sat tilted for the remainder of the game.
“He is a very naturally gifted athlete,” Calhoun said. “We want him to be naturally gifted athlete who is a terrific basketball player. That is what he’s going to be eventually.”
But Drummond wasn’t the only big getting it done for the Huskies. Tyler Olander finished with seven points on 3-of-4 shooting and six rebounds, while Oriakhi added five points and six boards.
KING CASEY
The handful of NBA scouts in attendance at Gampel Pavilion on Thursday night may have been there to watch Drummond and Lamb, but junior Kyle Casey may have drawn some attention to himself.
The 6’7 forward, who finished with a team-high 12 points, posed some matchup problems for the Huskies and beat UConn’s bigger defenders with his ability to knock down open looks from the perimeter.
“[Casey’s] quick. He can shoot; he’s athletic—he does a lot of things a small forward does, but he’s a power forward,” said Napier, a close friend of Casey’s.
Casey, who shot 4-of-9 from the field on the night, knocked down a pair of three-pointers, including one with 6:07 to play in the first half that ended a 9-0 UConn run and brought Harvard within six.
“Kyle should be able to be an inside-out player for us, which is what’s done,” Amaker said. “I thought he played very hard and fairly well. He made some perimeter shots, which is something we’re going to need to stretch the defense against any opponent.”
Perhaps even more impressive than his final stat line, Casey managed to stay out of foul trouble throughout the contest despite playing a season-high 33 minutes.
MISFIRING
With Wright and the Crimson’s post offense limited by UConn’s size up front, Harvard needed a strong shooting performance if it was going to come away from Storrs with a victory.
But Harvard, which has been plagued by shooting woes all season, continued to struggle on Thursday, as the Crimson shot just 7-of-21 from beyond the arc.
“With their perimeter players, I thought they increased the pressure, forced us into some bad things, some quick things,” Amaker said.
Through nine games, Harvard has yet to shoot over 40 percent from deep on a single night, a feat it accomplished 14 times a season ago.
Wings Christian Webster and Laurent Rivard, the Crimson’s leaders in made three-pointers this season, connected on just 4-of-14 attempts.

Entering Thursday night’s contest, the Crimson had struggled to find the back of the net early in games. But the Harvard women’s hockey team (7-4, 6-2 ECAC) wasted no time getting on the board at Providence College (8-10-3, 6-4-1 Hockey East), as three unanswered first period goals propelled the Crimson to a 5-1 non-conference win.
“I thought it was a great team effort,” junior goaltender Laura Bellamy said. “We got off to a strong start. Our forwards did a nice job getting to the net, and we got a few goals [early on]. It was good for us to be able to get a lead right away.”
Junior forward Jillian Dempsey led the way for Harvard, netting the first two goals of the game and putting the Friars in a deficit from which they could not recover.
Her first tally came 6:16 into the first period, after a pass from freshman forward Sami Reber sent the junior on a break down the middle. Dempsey found sophomore forward Lyndsey Fry and eventually popped the rebound of a Fry shot on goal into the back of the net.
“Dempsey had an unbelievable game,” Bellamy said. “She’s definitely one of our leaders up front, and she’s such a hard worker.”
Less than two minutes later, Dempsey played another puck past Providence goaltender Genevieve Lacasse, this time when the Crimson was playing shorthanded, to increase the Crimson lead to two. After blocking a Providence shot, Dempsey went the length of the ice to convert the unassisted tally.
“[Dempsey] coming up with a short handed goal was huge for us,” Bellamy said. “To score a goal of our own was great and gave us more breathing room going into the rest of the game.”
Sophomore forward Elizabeth Parker followed suit with under a minute to play in the opening frame, netting a pass from freshman forward Hillary Crowe to give the Crimson a commanding lead going into the break. Junior forward Margaret Chute was also credited with an assist on the play.
“We obviously wanted to get going right off the bat,” Dempsey said. “We said, ‘Early and often,’ so it was huge that we got going right away. Once you get one, the others are a little bit easier to get.”
Although Harvard dominated in the first period, the Crimson only just edged the Friars, 9-8, in shots on goal in the initial frame, and Harvard won 10 faceoffs to Providence’s eight in the game’s opening period. But the Friars were not without opportunities of their own, earning two power plays and forcing Bellamy to make eight saves in the first 20 minutes of play.
“We wanted to finish up the [calendar] year strong,” Dempsey said. “It was great for us to get five goals. Our offense was on fire, and our penalty kill was phenomenal.”
Providence cut the Crimson lead to two just 18 seconds into the second frame, as Ashley Cottrell tipped in a shot from teammate Laura Veharanta. But Harvard would not allow a comeback, netting a goal in each of the final two frames of its penultimate contest of 2011.
“We had wanted to strike early [in the second] and drive the stake in,” Dempsey said. “Their goal gave them a little bit of momentum, but we responded well and closed them out, which was huge.”
Sophomore forward Kalley Armstrong earned Harvard’s fourth goal of the night, unassisted, after a strong offensive stretch for the Crimson developed after the Friars’ only score.
In the final frame, Fry became the fourth Crimson player to tally a goal Thursday night with just over 19 minutes to play in the game. Freshman defender Sarah Edney slotted a pass to Dempsey on a Harvard power play opportunity. And after a failed attempt on goal from the junior forward, Fry put it away.
“It was great to see that many kids get on the score sheet,” Bellamy said. “I think it says a lot about how we’re playing together. ... If someone has a tough night, we work together and another player will step up for us.”
The win against Providence is Harvard’s second straight victory after its longest losing streak of the season. The Crimson also earned its first regular-season, non-conference win of the year, falling twice to No. 2 Minnesota earlier in the year.
“After the Minnesota series, we knew we had three games left in 2011,” Bellamy said. “We said we wanted to go 3-0, and so far we’ve done well. We’re going into UNH tomorrow hoping to finish the year with a win that will lead us into 2012. So far, we’ve been playing great hockey.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Golden State Warriors announced Friday that Jeremy Lin '10 has been waived by the team.
After signing a multiple-year contract with the team in July of last year, the second-year guard appeared in 29 games for the Warriors as a rookie in 2010-11, averaging 2.6 points, 1.2 rebounds and 1.4 assists per game.
He also made 20 appearances for the Reno Bighorns of the NBA Development League, averaging 18.0 points, 5.8 rebounds and 4.3 assists per game.
On the first day of NBA training camp, Lin—due to make nearly $800,000 this year—was pulled from practice and told he was let go.
"It was not a complete surprise," wrote Matt Steinmetz of Comcast Sports Net Bay Area. "Despite Stephen Curry's lingering ankle injury and Lin's vocal fan support, he was unable to establish himself as a consistent contributor off the bench."
The Warriors signed second-round draft pick Charles Jenkins—likely the team's new backup point guard—Friday as well.
Warriors beat writer Marcus Thompson reported that the move was related to Golden State's salary cap situation.
"Sheesh, if GSWs cut Lin & held back rookie deals just for cap room... that's scraping together every possible dollar for this F/A hunt," Mercury News sportswriter Tim Kawakami tweeted after the announcement.
The Warriors reportedly were set to present Clippers free-agent center DeAndre Jordan with an offer Friday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
By almost any metric, the 2011 Harvard football program had a historic campaign. Coach Tim Murphy became the winningest football coach in Crimson history. And nearly every week it seemed, the squad matched or broke some ancient offensive record.
Once it was all set and done, Harvard had scored 374 total points—breaking a modern-era record set by the juggernaut 2004 team—en route to a 9-1 overall record and a league title. After a shaky early-season loss to Holy Cross, no other team came close to topping the Crimson.
But Harvard really shined in conference play, going an unscathed 7-0. The Crimson’s smallest margin of victory was a healthy 10 points, which came in a 41-31 win over Cornell.
But even then, the contest wasn’t as close as the score made it seem. Down by 17 with two minutes to go, Cornell quarterback Jeff Mathews and Co. found the end zone with 1:32 left on the clock to narrow the gap to 10. But the game was already well out of reach by that point.
The team’s historic performance leads to the question: had any Harvard squad dominated the Ancient Eight quite so effectively as the 2011 version?
We’ll start our search in 1956, the first year of official Ivy League play. If we didn’t, we’d have to include years like 1890, when the Crimson outscored its opposition, 555-12. But at that time, Harvard was playing teams like Exeter, Williams, and Amherst (which lost, 74-6). So we’ll ignore those seasons.
Starting at 1956, just four Harvard teams have won all seven of their conference contests: 1997, 2001, 2004, and 2011 (all coached by Murphy). The 1968 squad got close, going 6-0-1 in conference play. And funny enough, its 29-29 “win” over Yale might be the most famous in school history. But because the team didn’t win ‘em all, we took it out of the running.
To decide which of those four squads had the best conference season, we calculated each one’s Pythagorean win expectation, which equals (points scored)2/((points scored)2+(points allowed)2). It’s a decent proxy for just how dominant a team was.
The results (Year, Pythagorean win expectation):
1997, 0.949
2011, 0.810
2004, 0.773
2001, 0.717
By a wide margin, the 1997 team—which featured now-NFL center Matt Birk ’98—comes out as the most dominant. And looking at the results from that year, it makes good sense. None of its seven league opponents scored more than 12 points against Harvard. In total, the Crimson averaged 27.7 points per Ancient Eight game while yielding just 6.4 to the other side.
The 2011 squad came in second, riding its historically-prolific 279 points in league play.
Interestingly, the two undefeated teams throughout the whole season—the 2001 and 2004 squads—rounded out the rankings (the 1997 team fell to Lehigh in a non-league contest).
The 2004 team’s third-place finish may come as the biggest surprise, though. Often considered the best team in Harvard football history, the squad featured Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05 at quarterback and Clifton Dawson ’07 at running back, arguably the two best at their position in the program’s storied history. Both made forays into the NFL, and of course, Fitzpatrick currently has a none-too-shabby starting gig in the league.
Yet fans often forget that the 2004 undefeated campaign nearly fell apart—twice. Harvard had two one-point victories, over Brown and Dartmouth. Only at the end of the year did the Crimson take on an air of invincibility. In the season’s last three games, Harvard outscored the opposition, 104-13.

We stumbled across this picture of Matt P. Damon (formerly '92) chilling with some friends during his time at Harvard. Looks like the dude had some fun, but more importantly, it seems like things really haven't changed much at all since Damon's youth. Kodak moment with a couple of friends? Check. Harvard banner? Check. Unyielding desire to procrastinate? Check. Come on, admit it. You enjoyed this image as much as we did. Now back to that paper!
