After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Hurry! The identity boat is still sinking! Crumple up and throw away two more aspects of your identity.”
What was this awful activity? My original 8 slips of self-written descriptors were already insufficient. I had tolerated throwing away three. But two more? How could I possibly survive on three things?
Perhaps I was a bit too into the game. But throwing away those two crumpled slips of paper stung with real self-betrayal. I suppose the three that I kept were fundamental, but without the clashing everything-else, they felt like nothing.
Coming into college, I was told by my friends, the media, my teachers, and even my mentor that this was my chance to change everything—a Willy Wonka golden ticket to a heaven of emptiness. All those ideals that I had of who I wanted to be perceived as, rather than who I actually was, could now be implemented. Throw out the parts of your identity you don’t like and rewrite yourself, they said. Rewrite, and rewrite again.
I considered it deeply, even more deeply than the classes I wanted to take. Because starting over at Harvard doesn’t just mean re­advertising yourself, it means re­naming your individuality. We were all, in one way or another, the best from where we came from. Valedictorians, class presidents, multi­-club leaders, research geniuses, aspiring philanthropists. Most importantly, we were all “Harvard” and praised for that unnecessarily consuming identity. We were told (probably too often and for the wrong reasons) that we were special. We were distinguished. We were somebody.
So now all of us Harvards have gathered, and the quest to be once again recognized as the best has begun. It’s a quest that I didn’t ask to take on and one that I never wanted to be given. But in the midst of strangers, every move is a first impression, so why not press on.
By the end of two weeks I was weary. How many hands had I shaken? Why do we even shake hands? Initiative. Take more initiative. Why do I do that again?
I tried to paint myself as being friendlier than I wanted to be, funnier than the jokes I don’t know, and more constantly interesting than unpredictable me. There was no confusion. I was too tired for that, and I knew what I was doing. First impressions had to be made and I would make them well. But at the end of two weeks I was left with no energy, a list of contacts that didn’t respond, and a suite that was constantly empty. I realized that I had flitted around so eagerly with my identity that I had lost my personality.
In trying to be an affable fragment of the world, I forgot to engage in it with my entire self. I was walking away from conversations with a more vivid picture of myself than the person to whom I had been speaking. I was trying to establish my worthiness through the number of people I could impress into being my friend. And I was alienating the people I actually wanted to befriend by depriving them of the unthinking attention they deserved. Consumed with myself, I forgot to notice who they were.
There was no drama in the revelation. I simply let go. I had to. I let go and allowed myself to be unapologetically sarcastic, caring, needy, and sincere. I wasn’t accepted by everyone, but here I am now, with groups of close friends that I couldn’t have imagined having when I first set out on this journey. Meeting them was a joy and not a painful obligation. And I felt myself come to life.
Because those slips of identity that I wrote down can’t be throw away. If the identity boat is sinking because they are too powerful, I will go down with them. They’re too important to abandon, and far too important to be purposefully rewritten. Because even though this incredible blank slate will allow me to finally ditch outdated expectations, there is a fine line between that and creating an unauthentic fantasy. So to my friends, teachers, and mentors: don’t worry. I will rewrite myself exactly, in all my wonderful inconsistency.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A little under a year ago, a mass of drunken undergraduates and I, with more reading period burdens on our shoulders than clothes on our backs, gathered in Harvard Yard for the notorious, biannual Primal Scream to commemorate the start of final exams. We were joined on this freezing, rainy night by a crowd of Black Lives Matter protesters carrying signs and chanting words that I no longer recall. The protesters called for a period of silence just prior to the start of the Scream to honor the death of Michael Brown, a call that went unanswered as the clock struck midnight and the runners, in lieu of stampeding over the protesters standing in the path of the usual counterclockwise lap around the Yard, turned to run unhindered in the opposite direction.
In the hours and days following, sentiments were expressed interpersonally and over social media about the insensitive nature of the Screamers who collectively chose to run instead of agreeing to the moment of silence. Specifically, the image of the white runners evading and thus delegitimizing the black protesters’ cause was at the forefront of the scrutiny. The white students involved were called out as a whole for their inaction.
On some level, I felt personally attacked for having unintentionally been a part of something so upsetting. After all, in the confusion, I hadn’t known what the protesters were asking for that night. I hadn’t been aware that they were going to be present at the Scream at all. I wanted to make it publicly known that I, a white person, hadn’t wanted to contribute to something that pained my peers of color so deeply. Feeling distraught, I took to Facebook to apologize for the way things had gone via a ridiculously long status.
I had good intentions. But I was missing the point.
You see, there’s a very specific dynamic surrounding the discussion of privileged-underprivileged dichotomies like that of the Black Lives Matter movement. It’s the same dynamic that accompanies the messed up dance of #notallmen and #yesallwomen, or the backlash that as a queer person I tend to receive when I say things like, “Straight people are the worst.”
When a privileged monolith is called out for its role in systematic, sociopolitical imbalances, it stings on the individual level.
In other words, when “all” of any majority group are held responsible for something, its members cry out in protest, insisting that while they may be part of a problematic group, they are not themselves the problem. The real culprits, they declare, are just “some” of them.
And there is real merit to this argument. I don’t think anyone could logically argue that every white person is equally to blame for the institutional racism sewn into our country’s skin. Nor would one insist that every man is responsible for the culture of misogyny and rape that disadvantages all women. Nor still does one believe that every straight person equally perpetuates homophobia.
So why do we call out people on the level of “all,” when the problem exists only in “some?”
There are at least three prominent reasons. Firstly, and very simply, there does not, and likely cannot, exist a filter with which to separate the problematic people from the helpful. To use language like “some” when discussing matters for which people must take responsibility, like when dealing with racially disadvantageous systems, creates an automatic hole in the screen through which the most ignorant culprits can slip, claiming, “Well, I’M not the problem,” when they actually are. Leaving this hole open gives more blatant bigots the power to maintain their bigotry. One says, “some,” they hear, “others.”
Further, the degree to which any person is “problematic” is not black and white, but rather quite nuanced. Even allies, those less compliant in the actions of their monoliths, may accidentally create problems without realizing it. This was my downfall when taking to Facebook to profess my deep regret for my part in the Primal Scream fiasco: I was so concerned with clearing my white name that I forgot to remember the black cause. I wanted too badly to remind everyone that I was an ally, and in doing so I momentarily stopped being one. I turned the lens on myself when it wasn’t meant to be there.
Finally, there is no denying that whether or not one personally contributes to institutional racism, it’s a problem that all people of color face. Whether or not any one man contributes to a sexist society, all women are forced to fight back against it. And whether or not a straight person directly or inadvertently perpetuates homophobia, they still benefit from a heteronormative society in a way that no queer person does. The underprivileged do not get the luxury of identifying with something other than “all,” so neither, then, should their privileged counterparts.
So what’s the takeaway? Being an ally and acknowledging your role as part of the “all” is crucial to the demarginalization of minority groups. But it’s not about being sorry, or being a hero with a clear, elevated conscience. It’s about understanding that you’re part of a larger problem, whether or not—and regardless of how severely—you contribute to it. It’s about supporting those fighting against oppression without turning the focus on yourself. And that’s the point that I was missing after Primal Scream. I write about it here in the hopes that readers may become as hot and bothered as I have on the matter, and that they may take a step back and acknowledge that those who must take responsibility for and action against injustice are not the “some”, but indeed the sum, of a majority group’s parts.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The rapid growth in recent years of the fantasy sports industry has been accompanied by increased scrutiny: The FBI has begun to examine closely the activities of daily fantasy sports sites, and the New York Times last week published a report about fantasy sports betting. Calls for increased regulation of the industry have grown louder and more pervasive as well. Last week, Massachusetts State Senate President Stanley Rosenberg urged the state government to strengthen its approach to the industry. “We regulate and tax horse racing,” Rosenberg said. “To me it's a similar thing.”
The position taken by Rosenberg, as well as by House Speaker Robert DeLeo, reflects a growing push to treat fantasy sports as gambling in Massachusetts. In 1992, Congress outlawed sports betting nationwide—a ban that still applies in all but five states. But after heavy lobbying from the National Football League and Major League Baseball, Congress made an exception in 2006 for fantasy sports, defining it as a game of skill, not chance. Users of the most popular websites, including ESPN and Yahoo! Sports, have thus avoided government control.
But the continued growth of the fantasy sports industry is proving this exception outdated. An estimated $26 billion, with an average of $465 per player, are spent annually on fantasy sports in the United States and Canada. With the emergence of FanDuel, Draft Kings, and other similar sites offering daily and weekly windows for betting—as opposed to the conventional format in which users compete for the duration of a given sport’s season—fantasy sports is evolving away from its original purpose as a hobby and towards a business. Moreover, these new forms of fantasy betting did not yet exist when the 2006 law was passed; in short, whether Congress would still consider many of the current games to be based on skill is unknown.
This is especially clear as scandal envelops the industry. Both DraftKings and FanDuel—the two most prominent daily fantasy sites—recently have had to ban its employees from playing fantasy sports for money when one DraftKings employee reportedly won $350,000 playing on rival site FanDuel. Multiple class action lawsuits have since been filed against the company, alleging insider trading.
A 2015 Sports Business Daily study found similarly unsettling results. Over the first half of the MLB season, the study found, 91 percent of daily fantasy profits were won by just 1.3 percent of users, accentuating the divide between those whom the study called “sharks” and the vast majority of players.
It is unclear exactly how the Commonwealth should regulate fantasy sports. Attorney General Maura Healey, who is reviewing the industry’s legality, explained, “This is a new industry. It’s something that we’re reviewing, and we’ll learn more about it.” But it cannot be doubted that these fantasy sports outlets are large-scale commercial gambling outlets, analogous to banned industries like casinos and horseracing; and they should be treated as such by the state government, and subjected to regulation and taxation.

Randomly assigning students to seats may be one way to crack down on academic dishonesty in the classroom, according to a new study.
Cheating continues to be a problem at Harvard and other colleges around the nation, according to the study, entitled “Catching Cheating Students” and published this month by the National Bureau for Economic Research.
Steven D. Levitt, the University of Chicago economics professor of “Freakonomics” fame, co-authored the study. He wrote in an email that he hoped the findings would indicate to people “how easy it is to cheat when no one tries to stop you, how easy it is to catch cheaters, and how easy it is to prevent cheating on exams if you try.”
In the study, Levitt and Ming-Jen Lin, an economics professor at the National Taiwan University, developed an algorithm “for identifying cases of students copying off one another’s exam answers” and tested it at an unidentified “top university in which the professor suspected cheating may have occurred.”
At least 10 percent of the class’s 242 students were said to have cheated on a midterm exam, and when they were assigned seats randomly for the final exam, “almost all evidence of cheating disappears.”
Harvard’s approach to addressing academic dishonesty in the classroom, especially on the heels of its largest cheating scandal in recent memory in 2012, was introducing an honor code, which went into effect at the beginning of the semester. 
Levitt said he is skeptical about the efficacy of honor codes in cases of academic dishonesty.
“I think honor codes are likely, if anything, to increase cheating,” Levitt wrote. “Mostly, what honor codes do is to lead teachers not [to] try to prevent cheating, which ultimately lead to more cheating.”
Since the unnamed American university in the study did not have an honor code, that factor was not included in the report, according to Levitt.
At Harvard, the study’s approach of randomly assigning students to seats may or may not have real merit in classrooms, depending on the size of a course, Philosophy Department Chair Edward J. Hall wrote in an email.
“[T]he simple idea of arranging seating during exams might be a good one,” wrote Hall, who was involved with the creation of the honor code. “I still have reservations, though, because unless it is clearly explained why the policy is in place, students might very naturally feel patronized, and distrusted. And that’s a reaction that works directly against the aims of having an Honor Code, in the first place.”
Hall made a distinction between “cozy” courses—small enough that students and the professor interact—and “anonymous courses”—in which students are simply faces in a large lecture hall.
“In a cozy course...the students—most of them, anyway—form enough of a connection to the professor and the rest of the teaching staff that open, honest conversation about academic integrity is possible and fruitful,” Hall wrote. “[T]his can create real trust—so that students come to feel that it would be dishonorable to cheat, and the professor thereby feels much less pressure to impose anti-cheating measures of the kind the article describes.”
Levitt said he thinks the study’s findings do not presage large changes for Harvard and its peer institutions.
“I don't think our study has much of a broader implication,” Levitt wrote. “People know there is cheating, and they know how to stop it.”

Julian Savulescu, a professor of practical ethics at Oxford, argued for the practice of taking controversial biological measures to foster moral improvements in society at Harvard Law School on Tuesday.
Savulescu’s lecture focused on the ways advancements in science can improve moral behavior, such as by predicting which people have a greater likelihood of being violent through their genetic makeup. 
According to Savulescu, continued research in life sciences and neuroscience may lead to future opportunities in the use of biological markers that can test for certain genes that predict aggressive behavior, which would potentially alter the criminal justice system.
“It’s quite plausible that in the future, increased knowledge of neuroscience, neuroimaging, genetics, and biology will provide more fine grain ways of dividing human beings into low and high risks,” he said.
He added that critics who condemn his research overwhelmingly cite objections regarding individuals’ autonomy, the ethics of acting on this research if scientifically possible, and the nature of morality itself.
For his part, Savulescu countered these criticisms by pointing to potential societal benefits.
“Putting someone on Ritalin after one violent crime reduces the reoffense rate,” he said. “Reduction of violence against innocent people is absolutely a moral outcome.”
Savulescu also spoke of the widely contested practice known as procreative beneficence, the eugenic selection of embryos with what he described as “the best chance of the best life.”
“We could use genetic testing of embryos to select those embryos of the group that are healthy, and otherwise equal, who have lower risk of violent aggression,” he said.
Peng Zhao, a visiting fellow at the Law School who attended the lecture, said this category of medicine has broad implications.
“I’ve found through this presentation that there may be some solutions to the significant scientific disputes of genetic enhancement research currently taking place in China,” Zhao said.
Savulescu argued that although these scientific interventions to promote moral behavior may limit freedom, both potential victims and criminals would be better off.
“If moral enhancement reduces serious crime, it benefits the potential victims and it also benefits the potential criminals by preventing imprisonment,” he said. “When the cost to you is small and the benefit to somebody else is large, you ought to perform that action.”
Following the lecture, Thomas I. Cochrane, a neurology professor at Harvard Medical School, warned of the dangers of adopting this practice too quickly.
“We are really in the infancy of this technology. These traits that we’re talking about are incredibly complex, even if you’re referring to them on an abstract level. There certainly is a risk of adopting this technology too early,” Cochrane said.

UPDATED: October 22, 2015, at 2:07 a.m.
Women have made huge strides in media and politics but continue to face significant obstacles, Yahoo Politics editor-in-chief Garance Franke-Ruta ’97 argued at the Kennedy School of Government on Tuesday. 
The event, entitled “Women, the Media, and Campaign 2016” and hosted at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics, and Public Policy, focused on the state of women in politics and political journalism. Franke-Ruta, a 2006 fellow at the Shorenstein center, characterized it as “mixed.”
“On the one hand, we have more women than ever before covering the presidential candidates, and more women than ever before running competitive races within the primary system,” she said. “On the other hand, the media still struggles collectively with how to present female voices to the public...in a way that acknowledges their authority and expertise.”
Franke-Ruta noted in particular the media’s continued attention to female candidates’ physical appearances, requiring prominent candidates such as Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina to control their images carefully.
Women in the world of political journalism have also made strides, but they too still face challenges, Franke-Ruta said, pointing to an increase in young female political journalists but a continued scarcity of women in editorial and management positions.
“One of the biggest challenges for women in journalism is the sort of intermediate moment in their career, when they’re not entry level but they’re not advancing at the same pace as some of their male peers,” Franke-Ruta said.
After her prepared remarks, Franke-Ruta took questions from the audience, which largely centered on the 2016 presidential campaign. She addressed topics including the continuing popularity of business mogul Donald J. Trump, the relative progressiveness of former Secretary of State Clinton, and the role of social media in the race.
Tuesday’s talk drew an audience of more than 30 people.
“I like to come to these events to keep current,” Gardner “Garry” Emmons ’67 said. Of Tuesday’s talk, Emmons said, “I thought it was a very interesting discussion about the role of women politicians and what they have to go through and do and achieve.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: October 22, 2015
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the Harvard fellowship Garance Franke-Ruta ’97 earned in 2006. In fact, Franke-Ruta was a fellow at the  Shorenstein Center, but was not specifically a Walter Shorenstein Media and Democracy fellow.

For the past 18 months, students walking from Harvard Yard toward the Radcliffe Quad have been confronted by barricades and mounds of dirt blocking their way through the Cambridge Common.
The construction, and the obstructions, are the result of a City of Cambridge project that looks to improve conditions in the park.
“The park was in very poor condition, with a lot of pathways that were in bad shape and drainage issues,” said Bill J. Deignan, the city’s transportation program manager.
The project is scheduled to be completed by the end of the year. Deignan said the project’s contractor, despite some earlier setbacks, “is on track to have pretty much all of the work done” on time.
Deignan said the city will replace lighting systems to better illuminate the Common at night. The city is also constructing “a multipath connection alongside Flagstaff Park so that people can better get in and out of Harvard Square toward Mass. Ave.”
The only potential delay the city expects involves planting new trees, a process that will have to continue into the spring, he said.
According to Deignan, planners conceived the project so as to minimize pedestrian inconvenience. “We did think ahead of time about the phasing of the project so that people could use the Common while it was under construction and use the paths to go where they needed to go,” he said.
 Still, some Quad residents expressed frustration with the long timeline for the construction work.
“I think that for a park, it sucks that Cambridge Common has just been under construction for the past two years,” said Aakriti Prasai ’18, who lives in Cabot House.
“In the beginning of the year when the paths were closed, it was pretty annoying because I had to walk different ways,” said Isaac L. Alter ’16, another Cabot resident who noted improvement now that the paths have reopened.
Other students, including Tess V. Davison ’16, were mostly ambivalent about the construction. Davison, also a Cabot resident, said, “I pretty much never walk through there, so it doesn’t really affect my life.”
“At this point the project has been going on for 18 months,” Deignan acknowledged, “so I think people are ready to see it wrap up and be over.”

Before Y2Y opens the nation’s first student-run shelter for homeless youth in November, the student and alumni leaders of the organization hope to raise the last $50,000 of a $1.25 million capital campaign.
The funds, raised through a crowd-sourced campaign set to end Nov. 5 ahead of a pre-opening celebration, will go toward renovating the planned space for the shelter. As of Tuesday morning, the campaign has raised $17,218, nearly 34 percent of the goal.
Jacqueline D. Modesett ’17, fundraising director for Y2Y, said the full renovation of the shelter’s space in the basement of First Parish Church requires the donations. 
Modesett said significant portions of the funds have come from “very generous grants and individual donors” in addition to on-campus events. The Harvard Square Business Association has also been instrumental in raising money for the shelter, according to Sarah A. Rosenkrantz ’14, one of the founders of Y2Y.
To further push its fundraising on campus, Y2Y launched a “team-up” initiative Tuesday that aims to engage varsity athletic teams at Harvard in “competitive fundraising.” Y2Y has also been promoting the campaign on social media and plans to reach out to student groups at the College in its next step.
Previous donations to the shelter went through the Phillips Brooks House Association, with which Y2Y is formally affiliated, but Rosenkrantz said she was glad that Y2Y was crowd-sourcing for the last portion of donations.
“Over the past few years we’ve been building relationships with lots of different people, and this is a way to kind of pull everyone together around the final push, where a lot of small donations can make a big difference,” Rosenkrantz said.
The shelter’s Young Adult Advisory Council, a group of young people who have recently experienced or are currently experiencing homelessness, is working with Rosenkrantz and Greenberg both to design how the shelter will run and assist with the campaign. Council member Andrew Giampa said he hopes people will relate to the cause and donate.
“You never know, you could be in that boat someday,” Giampa said.
Rosenkrantz and Samuel G. Greenberg ’14 started Y2Y when they were undergraduates at Harvard. Both are now working full time on getting the shelter up and running.
“This issue is very important to me, because it’s young people that are our own age experiencing homelessness in our community,” Rosenkrantz said. “I think that it’s important as students with a lot of privilege that we make change and provide this shelter.”

Amidst negotiations and three weeks past the expiration date of its previous contract, Harvard’s largest union has hung posters and other forms of signage throughout campus to advocate its positions.
The posters, emblazoned with slogans such as “It shouldn’t hurt to pay for health care” and “Together we should build a better plan,” are present throughout many Harvard buildings. They also feature prominently outside the offices of members of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, which counts more than 4,000 members. 
HUCTW director Bill Jaeger said the public appeal effort directly responds to the union’s ongoing contract negotiations with Harvard. He said those conversations have continued in light of continued disagreement over healthcare plans.
“These negotiations are becoming difficult and could use a burst of energy,” Jaeger said. “Everyone can use some more excitement in trying to find better ways to solve our issues.”
Carrie E. Barbash, a HUCTW organizer, said the union’s effort to appeal to the public is part of an overall strategy that looks to foster awareness of the negotiations and major issues across the University.
“Part of why we wanted to do something like this is to make it a community-wide conversation,” Barbash said. “We want to get all the other members of the Harvard community involved in the conversation as well. Building a plan together is the best way to address everyone’s needs.”
Jaeger called HUCTW members’ response to the union’s new efforts “enthusiastic.”
“Our members have given us a very positive response to this appeal,” Jaeger said. “They are very hopeful and optimistic that good-hearted negotiations are a good way to solve issues, especially health care.”
Jaeger and Barbash both said this campaign also specifically targets students to show them what is at stake during the contract negotiations.
“College students are employees to be and at some point in the next few years, they will be coming into the new, broken healthcare system,” Jaeger said. “We have a great history of working in partnership with students and we encourage them to become more engaged in this community-wide conversation.”
Harvard spokesperson Tania M. deLuzuriaga emphasized Harvard’s commitment to conducting successful and effective negotiations in a timely manner in a statement.
“Harvard and the HUCTW continue to negotiate in good faith for a new contract agreement that advances the interests of the union and the University’s mission of research, teaching and learning,” she wrote in an emailed statement. “Harvard deeply values the many important contributions made to our academic mission by HUCTW staff.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Parts of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences are expected to relocate to Allston in 2020, instead of 2019 as previously planned, and details about whose offices will cross the Charles River remain in flux, according to administrators and professors.
“When coordinating the ongoing internal planning, external regulatory approval process, community review and construction timelines, 2020 emerged as the realistic date of building availability,” SEAS spokesperson Paul Karoff wrote in an email. 
In 2013, University President Drew G. Faust said the SEAS faculty in “almost its entirety” would move to Allston. Current plans, though, state that two-thirds of SEAS faculty will move to the new complex, and just which professors will comprise that group is still being determined.
There is still “a lot of uncertainty and brainstorming going on” regarding who will leave Cambridge and who will stay there, according to SEAS Dean Francis Doyle III, who began his tenure in August.
“It’s disruptive when you move groups. Groups have connections, networks, and ties,” he said. “We will have a planning list by December, and even if there are people who aren’t certain about this, we will go forward with the planning list.”
Doyle added, though, that this “planning list” will be merely a “prediction,” rather than a definite decision of which professors will relocate. Between now and 2020, SEAS will hire new faculty members and some current professors will retire, so names will inevitably be added or subtracted from the list, he said.
According to the latest plan, several areas—Applied Mathematics, Applied Physics, Electrical Engineering, and Environmental Science and Engineering—will remain in Cambridge during the first phase of development, according to Karoff. Meanwhile, Bioengineering, Computer Science, Materials Science, and Mechanical Engineering will tentatively relocate to the new Allston campus.
And while SEAS administrators try to determine the details surrounding the growing school’s upcoming relocation, faculty opinions on the move are divided, with some professors anticipating an internal division of their teaching areas across two campuses.
SPLIT DOWN THE MIDDLE
Almost three years after administrators announced plans for SEAS to relocate, the school’s professors still hold mixed views on an impending Allston move. Materials Science and Mechanical Engineering professors Joost J. Vlassak and Xin Li said they expect their teaching area to be split across Cambridge and Allston when the relocation takes place.
Vlassak suggested that entire departments may not make the move. Within Material Sciences and Mechanical Engineering, he said, “I think some people will move, some will stay here.”
Vlassak, who does not yet know whether he wishes to relocate to Allston, said he is in “a difficult position” because he studies both hard material, which requires extensive use of the Cambridge-based Center for Nanoscale Systems, and soft material, which does not. Even though he is excited about the new facilities in Allston, whether he wants to relocate will depend on his research focus a few years from now, he said.
Faculty members in the Electrical Engineering teaching area have also expressed divergent opinions on whether or not their cohort should relocate, according to Woodward Yang, a professor in that area.
“We’re debating back and forth whether we are going to split the [Electrical Engineering faculty] or not, because splitting is not a good idea,” Yang said. “But what do you do when there are eight of you, and two want to stay? It’s hard to force people to do things, especially tenured Harvard faculty.”
Though Karoff called it “unlikely” that some teaching areas will be split across two campuses, he wrote in an email that “It will be individual faculty members’ decision to move their [offices or labs] to Allston.”
Part of the resistance to the move has come from faculty members who conduct research at the Cambridge-based Laboratory for Integrated Science and Engineering, which hosts expensive fabricating devices, and is unlikely to be rebuilt in Allston. At least one professor affiliated with that lab, Materials Science and Mechanical Engineering professor David Clarke, is a member of a SEAS teaching area scheduled to move. Clarke could not be reached for comment.
Some professors said they expect to have a foot in both campuses and are counting on administrators to make commuting more convenient. Li, who expects to spend half his time at each campus, said he would not want to pay an additional parking fee in Allston.
A BRIDGE TOO FAR
Other SEAS professors said they fear that the physical distance created by moving could impede their collaboration across Faculty of Arts and Sciences departments outside of SEAS.
For his part, Applied Physics professor David A. Weitz said moving some SEAS faculty will diminish the kind of spontaneous interactions that help spark new ideas, such as two researchers running into each other in a hallway and starting a conversation. And the separation of some parts of SEAS from the others could also make the school less attractive to potential new faculty members, he said, because they may not be able to work alongside their desired collaborators.
Weitz also expressed his concerns that what administrators tout as a competitive edge for SEAS—an engineering education embedded in a liberal arts education—will be jeopardized by moving parts of the school across the river.
“If we look two miles down the road, there’s a great engineering school, and we can’t compete with them unless we have strong interactions with other parts of University,” he said. “You can’t tear SEAS out of the rest of the school and expect it to thrive. It’s going to be a disaster.”
Others disagree. Computer Science professor Harry R. Lewis ’68, the former interim dean of SEAS who has called Allston “the promised land,” said the school’s interactions with the rest of Harvard will increase, not diminish. “The amenities will be so attractive, and everybody will want to go to Allston,” he said. “Our space will be where people want to come to work on their English papers.”
And Karoff said the school’s current Cambridge campus is not cohesive in the first place, spanning more than a dozen buildings. The Allston expansion will allow the school to become more consolidated than in the past, he said. Administrators are also planning to establish video connectivity between the two campuses and improve transportation.
STAYING AND GOING
The original plan detailed in 2014, which stipulates that two-thirds of SEAS will move to Allston, now appears unrealistic in view of faculty sentiment, Weitz said.
James R. Rice, a professor of Engineering Sciences and Geophysics whose teaching area is not slated to move, called life after relocation a “nuisance.”
Weitz and Yang both said Computer Science faculty members seem more receptive to the move, compared to other teaching areas within SEAS, because they do not have heavy laboratory equipment that would need to be moved or rebuilt.
And the move raises questions outside of faculty members’ academic lives, Yang said.
“Some want to move because they live in Allston,” he said. “Others complain they bought a house in Cambridge.”
Weitz argued that the relocation would be much more attractive if other parts of the University moved as well to create a interdisciplinary center in Allston. Yang agreed that professors can be heavily influenced by their colleagues in deciding whether moving to Allston is a good idea.
“It’s kind of like a party,” he said. “Nobody wants to go to a party if no one is going.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In light of human rights issues across the globe they feel the mainstream media has ignored, a group of Harvard students is spearheading a new campus publication to fill the gap.
The Harvard College Human Rights Review, founded last year by Daniel Barcia ’15, will release its first publication next semester with the hope of bringing attention to human rights abuses organizers describe as undercovered.
“The idea is to focus on issues that aren’t being picked up by The New York Times or CNN, or even major human rights groups like Amnesty or Human Rights Watch,” co-editor-in-chief Kate S. Hoffman ’17 said.
Although the first publication is not expected to be released until April or May, some articles written last year by interested members were published last week on the organization’s website. The articles address topics such as violence in Colombia, HIV in China, and child labor in India.
Co-editor-in-chief Kamran M. Jamil ’18 wrote an article on human rights concerns in Patagonia.
“I’m very interested in the environment and multinational corporations and their impact on health and human rights,” Jamil said. “Not a lot of people know about what's going on in Patagonia.”
To find stories, writers collaborate with graduate students at the Kennedy School of Government who are doing their own research on topics that they feel have not been covered sufficiently in academic writing.
“We want to do something that has an impact,” Hoffman said. “Our mission is to create a dialogue on campus, and I think that has a lot of weight to it if we do it correctly.”
The publication is currently reaching out to potential writers.
“It’s been getting a lot of positive attention,” Jamil said. “Students are really excited. There’s a lot of energy and enthusiasm being generated, especially amongst freshmen who want to get involved with human rights. This isn’t a club most of them had in high school.”
After the application period ends on Nov. 1, Hoffman and Jamil plan to assemble a team of up to 15 writers to publish academic pieces on global human rights issues.
“We’re trying to be really thoughtful about how to create the biggest impact with the resources that we have.” Hoffman said, “For now, we’re trying to set up a good foundation.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Undergraduates are organizing a ballot referendum for the upcoming Undergraduate Council election that would call on Harvard to force final clubs to follow all anti-discrimination laws, despite that it is unclear whether administrators could legally take such a move.
In emails over House lists earlier this week, Jordan T. Weiers ’16 proposed a referendum that calls for Harvard to “reclaim administrative control over final clubs” and make them adhere to non-discrimination legislation such as the federal gender equity law Title IX. 
A petition in favor of the referendum has already garnered more than 125 signatures, according to Weiers; it will need 670 to make the ballot. If the question does make the November ballot, a majority of undergraduates participate in the election, and most of those vote for the proposal, the position would become the official stance of the undergraduate student government.
Weiers, a vocal critic of final clubs who previously called for their dismantling, said he originally intended to propose a referendum calling on Harvard to liquidate the clubs’ off-campus properties and replace them with several College diversity offices—a position he described in a recent Crimson op-ed. But Weiers said that proposal was too extreme for a referendum.
Even the referendum Weiers is proposing is questionably feasible. Final clubs, the subject of mounting scrutiny from both administrators and students, are not officially recognized by Harvard; they have not been since 1984, when the all-male clubs chose to cut formal ties with the University rather than admit women. Today, they are still located off campus and operate independently from the University, so while their members do sometimes maintain relationships with College administrators, Harvard has little real control over the groups and their activities.
While some experts in higher educational law have said administrators could potentially ban undergraduates from joining final clubs, the type of administrative control over them described in the referendum—that asserted by Harvard without the groups’ cooperation—may lack legal backing.
“It raises some tricky issues of whether Harvard really has the authority to jump in the middle and dictate what they can do,” said Peter F. Lake ’81, a professor at Stetson University College of Law who specializes in higher education law.
Weiers acknowledged that it is not clear what the University could and would do if the referendum on administrative authority over final clubs passed. He said the primary goal of his referendum petition is to increase student discourse about final clubs and the problems Weiers associates with them.
“I don’t think it would be unsuccessful if Harvard didn’t get rid of the final clubs in the next year, or in the next two years,” Weiers said. “Putting that option on people’s radars… would be a success.”
While UC referenda have traditionally sparked little change in the past, if administrators were to follow the proposal successfully, the move would represent a radical shift in their relationship with final clubs.
Administrators have long navigated a precarious relationship with the clubs, meeting with leaders privately but maintaining the party line of disaffiliation. In recent months, however, top administrators—including University President Drew G. Faust, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, and Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67—have publicly criticized the groups, even as one all-male club moved to go co-ed.
After gathering signatures and initial publicity, his referendum petition process came to a halt earlier this week, Weiers said, because of a recent Council rule change requiring that petitions first go through the UC’s website. But Weiers said he expects to gather the requisite signatures under the new rules, thereby moving the question to the ballot.
According to UC Rules Committee Chair Brett M. Biebelberg ’16, the Council does not vet potential ballot questions for feasibility.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In Washington, D.C., on Monday, University President Drew G. Faust again emphasized the role she believes universities should play in combating climate change—finding solutions through research and teaching.
Speaking at a U.S. Department of State forum, Faust invoked her consistent climate change argument at the forum, pointing to research and teaching as the key means by which universities can develop solutions to global warming. She invoked the seriousness of climate change as a “business issue, a policy issue, and a public health issue” that requires professionals across disciplines like engineering, economics, and finance to address it effectively. 
“Universities, perhaps more than any other institution, have the remarkable power to convene individuals and institutions around issues that transcend boundaries—boundaries that have shaped, and in some ways limited, our ways of thinking,” Faust said.
Specific research at Harvard, Faust said, has created sustainable innovations with implications beyond Cambridge, including developing energy-saving batteries to experimenting with bionic leaves that can convert solar energy into hydrogen.
The event, part of a two-day conference in Washington, D.C., also featured Secretary of State John F. Kerry, Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz, and several CEOs of energy companies, as well as higher education leader John J. Degioia, the president of Georgetown.
During her whirlwind two-day trip to the capital this week, Faust also met with Illinois Senator Dick Durbin and other government officials to lobby for increased federal research funding, which has dwindled over the past several years. She also appeared on a panel discussing humanities education at the American Association of Universities.
Despite her speech in Washington, not everyone on Harvard’s campus is convinced of Faust’s commitment to combating climate change. Student environmental activists from Divest Harvard have repeatedly criticized Faust for her refusal to divest Harvard’s endowment from the fossil fuel industry—one they say is undercutting the work of climate science. The group has staged a weeklong blockade of Massachusetts Hall in addition to sit-ins at the building, which houses Faust’s office.
Meanwhile, Faust has recently ramped up initiatives aimed at climate research and teaching. Earlier this month, Harvard granted $3.75 million to fund a project that will investigate climate change in China. The University also launched a fund that awarded $800,000 in February to finance climate research projects.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With signs reading “Ambition,” “Bold,” and “Diverse,” several black students at Harvard answered the question of what being black meant to them in a single word for a new photo and video campaign called “#HarvardBlackIs.”
“The project basically entails to teach people that the word ‘black’ is not a monolith, and there are many different, diverse aspects to black and blackness,” said Nehizena K. Edosomwan ’17 , who founded the project. “What we were trying to do was enforce positive images and the social commentary on self-love.”
In addition to posing for a photograph while holding a sign emblazoned with their chosen word, participants offered a longer statement, expanding on what that word means to them personally. A major theme of this project is the recognition of the individuality of experience, Edosomwan said.
The project is in the process of expanding “#BlackIs” beyond Harvard’s campus with other schools—including Spelman, Morehouse, and Boston University—that will be releasing their own versions of the project soon.
The project launched online a few weeks ago, and Edosomwan said he has met with representatives from Harvard’s Office of Student Life and Office for the Arts with the goal of continuing the discussion on campus.
Cyrus M. Motanya ’17, the vice president of the Black Men’s Forum, chose to use the word “unique” for the project, adding that “I define who Black is because I define who I am.”
One message of the campaign is to counter preconceived notions of what it means to be black, according to Montoya. “The idea behind it can even be represented by [Edosomwan],” he said. “He is a six-foot-nine, black, male athlete. But unless they talk to him and get to know him they won’t know that he studies Chinese.”
When Edosomwan began working on the project two years ago, he sought the advice of professors Henry Louis Gates, Jr., and S. Allen Counter, two prominent African American figures on campus.
“I just wanted to make sure that if I was going to do this project, it was going to be done to the best of my ability and something that people like them would be proud of,” said Edosomwan, a prominent member of the Harvard men’s basketball team.
In a press release introducing the campaign, organizers said the project developed in the midst of difficulties for the black community “from Charleston to Baltimore,” emphasizing the need to reaffirm and empower people of color.
“The #BlackIs movement was a part of being more aware of the things that black people as a whole were and are going through in America,” said Gabriel Onor, social chair of the Nigerian Students Association.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Readers of this column may recall that, two weeks ago, its lede included the following statement attributed to Harvard football coach Tim Murphy: “The bottom line is, the preseason’s over.”
Well, this reporter is still waiting for that moment, because it certainly hasn’t arrived yet.
The Crimson has taken the field five times in 2015. All five games have been Harvard routs, with an average margin of victory of 36 points. Halfway through its season, the undefeated Crimson hasn’t faced an opponent that can compete with the team for one quarter—let alone an entire game.
Following Murphy’s pronouncement of the preseason’s conclusion, Harvard dominated an overmatched Cornell team, 40-3. This past Saturday’s 42-0 trouncing of Lafayette was just the latest example of what Harvard fans have grown accustomed to seeing.
The visiting Crimson amassed 500 yards of total offense. Lafayette registered negative 18 yards rushing. Harvard converted 14-of-20 third downs and had five different players score touchdowns. The Leopards advanced into the red zone only twice and had nothing to show for it. The disparities go on and on.
No one truly expected the contest in Easton, Penn., to be competitive. No one was mistaken. Once again, the Crimson was simply on a different level than its opponent from start to finish.
So, it seems appropriate to wonder: when will the preseason actually end for Harvard football?
Will it be this coming Saturday against Princeton? In recent seasons, the Tigers have played the Crimson extremely tough, with the notable exception of their 42-point defeat last year in New Jersey. Keep in mind that Harvard’s last loss came in 2013 at the hands of Princeton.
But the Tigers have exhibited signs of weakness so far in 2015. Princeton narrowly escaped an upset three games ago at the hands of lowly Columbia in rainy weather. This past weekend, the black and orange faltered late and fell at the hands of Brown, 38-31. For context, Harvard thrashed the Bears by 26 points in week two, with most of Brown’s points coming against the Crimson’s second string.
Of course, Harvard can’t afford to overlook Princeton. And a coaching staff that takes every opponent seriously certainly won’t. But it seems a stretch to say that the Crimson will encounter an equal foe when the Tigers come to Cambridge on Saturday.
So, once again, when will the preseason end? Answer: in week seven. Against Dartmouth.
For the first time, Harvard will face a worthy adversary. Indeed, despite the absence of a championship pedigree for the Big Green in recent years, the Crimson would be wise to look at Dartmouth as an equal.
Harvard’s offense has been historically dominant over the first five games of the year. It is averaging 44 points a game, good for the program’s best mark since 1892. (That’s right, 123 years ago.)
But Dartmouth’s attack may be equally prolific, and it all starts with senior quarterback Dalyn Williams. The NFL prospect has made just about everything look easy so far this year, and his dual-threat running and passing ability has propelled Dartmouth to a 5-0 record.
Perhaps the Big Green’s most complete performance came in a 35-3 drubbing of Yale two weekends ago. Williams threw for a school-record 435 yards and four touchdowns.
So, yeah, the Dartmouth offense is pretty strong. But the team’s defense is intimidating in its own right, ranking just behind Harvard with a meager 9.4 points allowed per game.
If you’re a true Crimson fan, you’ve had this game circled in red on the schedule before the season even began. The championship race in the Ivy League will swing significantly based on the outcome of the heavyweight battle next Friday under the lights of Harvard Stadium.
This Saturday against Princeton could end up as just another rout, or it could mark the first game of the year when the Harvard starters aren’t removed in the second half. Who can say for sure? Either way, though, the preseason will come to a definitive end on Oct. 30 against the Big Green.
And it couldn’t come soon enough.
The 2015 Harvard football team has been so dominant that we haven’t once seen the unit tested. We’ll soon find out what kind of team the Crimson is when it’s thrown into the fire.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 21, 2015, at 5:37 a.m.
Taking a break from conference play for the penultimate time this season, the Harvard men’s soccer team (6-4-2, 3-0 Ivy) won a 3-2 thriller over the University of Pittsburgh (5-7-3, 0-5-1 ACC) on Tuesday to extend its mid-season winning streak to five games.
In the 67th minute, with the score level, senior forward Jake Freeman helped produce the game-winner, whipping a corner into a crowded box. The ball rattled around in the penalty area before falling to senior winger Michael Innocenzi, who powered it into the roof of the net. The close range volley, Innocenzi’s first score of the season, provided the game’s third and final lead change, leading the Crimson to a 3-2 win.
Harvard had its hands full against the Panthers, who after conceding the game’s first score, reclaimed the lead thanks to two goals in five minutes from freshman defender Matt Bragg and senior midfielder Patrick Dixon.
Pitt’s lead lasted a mere nine minutes, however. The Crimson, through quick and incisive one-touch play, managed to break down Pitt’s defense with senior striker Tim Schmoll, who attempted to lift a ball through to freshman attacking midfielder Cesar Farias.
But before the pass could come down, a Panther defender handled the ball in the box with his hand. Schmoll dispatched the penalty with aplomb, and on the stroke of halftime, the score was level at 2-2.
Capitalizing off of set piece opportunities proved important for the shorthanded Harvard squad. After earning a 1-0 victory over Brown Saturday night, the team flew down to Pittsburgh with a small squad. Among those who did not see playing time was junior co-captain Andrew Wheeler-Omiunu, who also missed the Brown game with a hamstring injury.
“We were physically lacking a bit,” Schmoll said. “[However] we are pretty good in terms of our mentality and fight. We have won some games by playing very well, and we have won some games by just fighting. Knowing that we have that in our arsenal is a big confidence booster for the whole group.”
Harvard opened the scoring in the same vein as Innocenzi’s winner. Again there was a corner, with the left boot of sophomore Christian Sady putting in a dangerous cross. Up rose junior center back Dan Smith, who headed the ball home. Set piece goals were a theme throughout the match, representing four of the match’s five goals.
Before the Panthers levelled the score at 1-1, Harvard had not conceded a goal since Yale’s 7th minute tally in a 3-1 Harvard victory in early October—a shutout streak lasting 378 minutes.
But on Tuesday, the Crimson was led by its offense—an attack that produced three goals, the most that Harvard has scored against an opponent all season.
“We were finding a lot of space today,” Schmoll said. “In the past few games we have been much more direct. Our finishing has improved.”
After going up 3-2, Harvard staved off the Panthers for the last 23 minutes. Pitt produced just one shot over that period, finishing with six on the night—three of which were on target. The Crimson, meanwhile, finished with six of its own, but Harvard never missed the target.
Despite earning just one win in its first seven games, the Crimson now finds itself in a groove heading into the final stage of the season, with four of its last five games coming against Ivy League opponents. Though he claims there is still plenty of work left to be done, Schmoll attributes the success of the team to consistency.
“At the start of the season we would have a great performance, then we would drop off,” Schmoll said. “Since then we have really improved in our consistency. It’s showing in our results.”
Harvard coach Pieter Lehrer expressed similar thoughts following his side’s weekend win over Brown.
“I think we just have to get better every day,” Lehrer said. “That’s what we look to do—making improvements every day.... We’ll just take it one training at a time and really that’s what we do. The group is finding a rhythm, which is great.”­

For some people, faculty dinners are an amazing event, an evening where you reconnect with a professor that also happens to be your research partner and best friend for life. In between spoonfuls of apple crisp, the two of you fall deep into conversation about cell biology and the readings you’ve been doing for fun, outside of class. Unfortunately, most are not section kid or section kid’s arch-nemesis, and our professors are not our closest friends. So how does one navigate a conversation about that statistics class for which you’ve never attended lecture? How do you display intellectual curiosity when you can’t remember the last time you did assigned readings, much less picked up a book featured in the New York Times? Never fear, for Flyby has you covered:
Talk about the weather
Despite whatever you may be thinking about the lack of creativity involved in discussing the weather, Boston’s winter as a talking point can be pretty clutch. From California? Talk about how brutal the transition has been for you, how your cute Patagonia puffy didn’t even last you until November, and how February should not exist as a month. If you’re from the East Coast, talk about how you thought you knew what you were in for, but how needing to walk in the snow has really changed the whole “winter” game. From the Midwest? Talk about how everyone is weak relative to what you’ve experienced back home. People love complaining about the weather– this should give you a solid five minutes of conversation, and can be a lead-in to the topic of where you’re from. You’ll be the closest of friends in no time!
Bond about “just Harvard things”
There are a couple basic topics everyone at Harvard should be able to say a little bit about– house life, renovations, freshman year, your excitement about Dean Khurana’s Instagram, the tourists, what you like to spend your BoardPlus on, your opinion about the aesthetic purpose of the rock garden in the Science Center plaza...the list goes on and on. Vague references to different aspects of Harvard life that your professor can relate to can help create a sense of *connection*.
Buddy up with a friend
This isn’t necessarily a “talking point,” but being able to lean on someone your own age when you realize that you’ve been attempting to discuss a world issue that you do not at all understand can really ease those awkward situations.
