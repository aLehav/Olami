After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard conducts its most sweeping investigation into academic dishonesty at the College in recent memory, several of the roughly 125 students implicated in the case say they are frustrated by the uncertainty they face as Harvard’s disciplinary board debates if and how to punish them.
On Thursday, Harvard administrators took the unprecedented step of announcing that they were investigating the large group of students for allegedly plagiarizing answers or inappropriately collaborating on a final take-home exam in an undergraduate class, which The Crimson reported was assistant professor Matthew B. Platt’s spring course Government 1310: “Introduction to Congress.”
Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris declined to comment on how long the investigation, which is being conducted on a case-by-case basis, could take, but one undergraduate among the suspected cheaters said that Secretary of the Ad Board John “Jay” L. Ellison had told him in a personal meeting that he could expect to receive a verdict by November.
The student said he feels the Administrative Board process has left him unable to make plans for the new semester that begins on Tuesday as he waits to hear whether he will be forced to withdraw from Harvard.
“I don’t know whether to unpack for the year or not,” said the student, who was granted anonymity by The Crimson because he did not want it known that he is suspected of cheating. “Do I buy textbooks? ... Because you can’t go on as if everything’s okay, because everything’s not okay.”
Although the Ad Board does not meet during summer months, the student said he wished Harvard had summoned administrators to campus during the break to expedite the process so students would know their fate before the fall semester began.
“Because of the unprecedented nature of this, they should have started this process as early as they could,” he said. “When Harvard realized that they were dealing with such a big widespread issue…they should have said, ‘Hey, we need [administrators] back here.’”
In an internal email between College administrators obtained by The Crimson, Ellison wrote on Aug. 16 that if the Ad Board votes to require a student in this case to withdraw from the College for a year—a known penalty for academic dishonesty at Harvard—that penalty would likely take effect immediately, allowing the student to return for the Fall 2013 semester.
He discussed the possibility that some students, especially those who believe themselves to be guilty, might choose to take a voluntary leave of absence at the start of the term, before the board adjudicates their cases. Such a leave would likely be converted to a required withdrawal on their records if they were later convicted, the email said.
The message was addressed to “Colleagues,” and one resident dean, who was granted anonymity by The Crimson due to the secrecy of the Ad Board’s deliberations, said that the email was delivered to others of the 12 House resident deans, who all serve on the Ad Board.
In the message, Ellison wrote, “The only folks that may want to really consider [a leave of absence] are those students who know that they cheated,” and noted that some students found guilty in the case may be sentenced only to probation or a lighter penalty, not a required withdrawal.
But he also wrote that any student athletes under investigation might choose to withdraw voluntarily before their first games of the season, even if their cases have not yet been settled. “Once they compete one time their season counts and they would lose eligibility if they had to take a year off and return,” he wrote, though he noted that advising students on NCAA eligibility is not the job of the Ad Board.
Both Ellison and Jeff Neal, a spokesperson for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, declined to comment on the email, which also mentioned that several students had expressed confusion about the reprisals they might face.
“We have had some feedback from students about confusing messages in reference to possible sanctions for the Gov 1310 case,” the email opened, naming the course which administrators have said they will not publicly identify.
One alumnus under investigation, who took “Introduction to Congress” last spring before graduating in May, said the lack of answers about how cheaters could be punished is especially nerve-wracking for recent graduates.
“It’s unfair to leave that uncertainty, given that we’re starting lives,” said the alumnus, who was granted anonymity by The Crimson because he said he feared repercussions from Harvard for discussing the case. “It’d be a huge financial and emotional hardship…. If my degree was threatened, I would not take that lightly.”
The current undergraduate under investigation complained that Harvard’s decision to announce the cheating scandal publically—a choice which Harris said was based on the College’s desire to use the widespread accusations as a teachable moment to caution against academic dishonesty—might hamper students who take a voluntary leave of absence while awaiting their verdicts from pursuing alternate occupations.
If these students apply for jobs or internships for the fall semester, the student said, they will likely face questions from potential employers who may have seen media coverage about the case. That may be especially problematic if those applications require a transcript—which would list the now-besmirched Government 1310.
By going public with the investigation, the student said, Harvard has made it “just impossible to keep what's supposed to be a confidential matter a confidential matter.”
According to the Ad Board website, a student under investigation in a case that does not involve a peer dispute is first notified that a complaint has been received, a step which has already been completed for this investigation, the College said.
The student then meets with the Secretary of the Ad Board to discuss the complaint and the Ad Board process, a step that some students said they had already completed. Next, the student submits a written statement which is reviewed along with other case materials by a subcommittee that meets with the student before filing a disciplinary case report. The student can respond to the report before all materials are reviewed by the full Ad Board for a final decision.
The student is then notified of the verdict, which either preserves or takes away the student’s “good standing” at the College.
In academic dishonesty cases, possible sanctions that do not change a student’s status at the College include a grade penalty, failure of the assignment in question, or a mark on a student’s transcript indicating no credit.
Sanctions that do change a student’s status include a probationary period or a requirement to withdraw. Students under investigation or out of good standing cannot receive diplomas.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Roger D. Fisher ’43, a Harvard Law School professor emeritus known for his innovative work in the field of peaceful conflict resolution and his best-selling book “Getting to Yes: Negotiation and Agreement Without Giving In,” died in Hanover, N.H. on Saturday, Aug. 25.
Fisher—who worked on some of the twentieth century’s most important international conflicts, from the Middle East to South Africa—died due to complications of dementia, according to the New York Times. He was 90.
“Roger really broadened and populated and crystallized the notion of win-win negotiation, and substituted it from ‘dividing the pie’ or ‘win-lose’ negotiation,” said Harvard Business School professor James K. Sebenius, Fisher’s successor as director of the Harvard Negotiation Project.
Fisher graduated from Harvard Law School in 1948 and taught at the school for more than three decades until his retirement in 1992.
Jamil Mahuad, a former president of Ecuador who was a fellow at the Institute of Politics after being ousted in a military coup, took a class from Fisher while a student at the Kennedy School in the 1980s. When Mahuad was president of Ecuador and facing “imminent war” with Peru, he called Fisher to coach him through negotiations.
Mahuad said that Fisher emphasized, “If you want peace, you have to talk with the other side.”
“I couldn’t get a better adviser,” he added.
From the border dispute between Ecuador and Peru to the Vietnam War, Fisher advised leaders and shaped negotiations across the globe. He created the template that would unite Egyptians and Israelis at Camp David in 1978, helped shape the agenda for the Reagan-Gorbachev summits, and held workshops to train South African officials on negotiation during the early 1990s.
Peter R. Fisher ’80, Fisher’s son, said that his father became involved in many discussions—from these international diplomacy issues to personal disputes—by effectively inserting himself into conversations.
“He would just call people up or write them a letter,” Peter said. “His friends said he was the epitome of chutzpah.”
Fisher’s advocacy for peace and resolution was fueled by his first-hand experience during World War II, according to friends.
“He was involved in a lot of the weather reconnaissance flights over Japan,” said his son, Elliott S. Fisher ’74. “The first morning solo flight was the weather reconnaissance flight. I remember hearing him talk about learning after the war that the residents of Hiroshima had learned to ignore the first solo air raid siren.”
The first plane over Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945, dropped an atomic bomb that killed 80,000 people on impact.
“He felt somewhat responsible for the extra deaths that happened in Hiroshima,” Elliott said.
Fisher lost 33 members of his graduating class on the battlefields, including his roommate and two close friends.
“He had seen up close and personal the impact of war, of losing friends,” said Andrea K. Schneider, who was Fisher’s research assistant at the Law School in the early 1990s. “War was not abstract—it was something that was dreadful and harmful and painful. He taught and said often that military power and economic might only get you so far; even if you win the war, you were going to lose friends along the way.”
Fisher dressed formally for each day of work in his Pound Hall office that was crowded with papers and books. He had “possibly the biggest smile you would ever see from a law school professor,” according to Schneider.
She said his work inspired a generation of law scholars who thank him for their love of field, including Schneider, who currently teaches at Marquette Law School.
Bruce M. Patton ’77—who, along with Fisher and William L. Ury, co-founded the Harvard Negotiation Project and was a co-author of the trio’s book “Getting to Yes”—said that Fisher was an endearing teacher.
“He would engage students in thinking with him about a problem, and he would listen,” Patton said. “He would listen to each different perspective.”
Patton first met Fisher as an undergraduate taking “Coping with International Conflict,” a popular course Fisher taught to undergraduates for 15 years. Fisher would send world leaders the conflict resolutions students would propose, according to Schneider, who was a teaching fellow for the course.
When teaching, advising, or parenting, Fisher, according to his son Peter, was known for putting his principles into practice.
“A lot of what goes into his theories of negotiation on conflict resolution is really getting inside the other person’s head, and he really could do that,” Peter said. “He could really put himself in your shoes. He could do that about your life, or about solving the Palestinian problem.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Shockwaves are reverberating in the government department following the revelation that Harvard is investigating about 125 students in Government 1310: “Introduction to Congress” for alleged academic dishonesty.
On Thursday, the College took the unusual step of announcing it was investigating the students for allegedly plagiarizing responses or inappropriately collaborating on a final take-home exam in an undergraduate class, which The Crimson reported was assistant professor Matthew B. Platt’s spring government course.
Government department administrators have slated the Government 1310 case for discussion at the department’s regularly scheduled faculty meeting on Tuesday, government professor Stephen D. Ansolabehere said.
Department chair Timothy J. Colton and Director of Undergraduate Studies Cheryl B. Welch did not respond to requests for comment on the case.
Robert H. Bates, a professor of government and African and African American studies, said that to his knowledge, government department administrators have not started any internal review to investigate cheating in the department or considered any rule changes related to academic integrity.
But Bates said he expects University administrators to issue “a very explicit statement of how much cooperation and sharing for preparation for exams is allowed.”
In the wake of the Government 1310 scandal, Bates said, “that’s got to be unambiguous.”
Ansolabehere said faculty members are looking to University President Drew G. Faust for leadership as Harvard moves toward a broader conversation about academic integrity—the reason that Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris said Harvard publicly announced the investigation.
“For 125 students to do this, I think it raises big questions that the University needs to deal with,” Ansolabehere said.
But he said that he is worried that appropriate collaboration, a valuable learning tool, will become a casualty of the scandal as professors and departments move to institute new rules prohibiting cooperative work.
“The reason that [study guides] existed in the first place was that they were actually helpful to students,” Ansolabehere said. “What's going to happen in chemistry when you can’t take in some study guides that help you remember the periodic table?”
Harvard’s Committee on Academic Integrity—a group of faculty members, administrators, and resident deans that has been meeting since October 2010—has been discussing the possibility of instituting an honor code at Harvard and will likely present recommendations to the College sometime this academic year, said Harris, who chairs the committee.
But several professors interviewed in light of this week’s announcement said they did not think the establishment of an honor code would curb cheating.
Bates said he thinks honor codes only work at academic institutions with a strong sense of community where students feel that if they cheated, they would be shamed by other classmates. Harvard may not fit that mold, he said.
“I don’t know if Harvard is intimate enough and tightly knit enough to support that kind of system,” Bates said. “It seems to me it’s probably too big and too segmented by the Houses.”
And when Harvard asked freshmen to sign a document stating that kindness was on par with academic accomplishment last fall, the simple pledge drew angry responses from professors who said that such a public declaration was inappropriate at Harvard. Eventually, the College cut the signatures and did not ask students to sign such a statement again this year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three matches. Three losses.
It was a rough weekend for the Harvard women’s volleyball team at the Hokie Invitational in Blacksburg, Va. After falling to Middle Tennessee State, 3-2, on Friday, the Crimson was blanked in back-to-back matches on Saturday, falling to Towson and a talented Virginia Tech team, 3-0.
“I think it was a really good learning experience; we played harder teams than we’re going to face in the Ivy League,” said junior middle blocker Teresa Skelly. “I think everyone grew a lot.”
The Crimson will return to Cambridge with a 0-3 record, matching the squad’s worst start since 2002.
“I would say that we need to work on speeding up our game,” said junior right side Erin Cooney. “The teams that we saw were a lot quicker than the teams in the Ivy League. We need to learn to defend against it, and we need to speed up our own offense.”
Cooney, who played a crucial role for the Crimson at the net as a sophomore, dislocated her finger in Harvard’s opener and was forced to sit out both of Saturday’s contests. The junior is awaiting X-rays but hopes to be back in action for the Crimson’s next contest on Friday against Manhattan at the Malkin Athletic Center.
Captain and outside hitter Taylor Docter played well for Harvard throughout the tournament, recording a team-high 31 kills and 24 digs, good for second on the squad.
“Taylor really stepped up,” said Skelly of Docter, who was named to the all-tournament team. “I thought [the recognition] was well deserved.”
TOWSON 3, HARVARD 0
In the final game of the tournament, the Crimson stayed close with Towson but was unable to take a set, falling, 25-18, 26-24, 25-16.
Three Tiger players posted double-digit kills, and Towson (6-2) finished with 50 kills to Harvard’s 31. Docter was the only Crimson player to finish in double figures, recording 11 kills. Skelly added seven kills, and rookie setter Hannah Schmidt handed out 24 assists.
VIRGINIA TECH 3, HARVARD 0
In Saturday’s opener, the Crimson fell to Virginia Tech, 25-12, 25-12, 25-15. The Hokies (4-2) were led by the combination of Samantha Gostling and Victoria Hamsher, who combined for 19 kills and attack percentages of .500 and .467, respectively. Virginia Tech setter Jordan Fish handed out a game-high 36 assists.
Docter led Harvard with six kills while sophomore outside hitter Kristin Casey contributed 11 digs.
MIDDLE TENNESSE STATE 3, HARVARD 2
Led by Docter’s 14 kills and 11 digs and rookie outside hitter Kathleen Wallace’s 16 kills, the Crimson battled back from a 2-0 deficit to force a fifth set on Friday.
“We all got really fired up,” said Cooney, who left the game in the first set due to injury. “We knew it wasn’t going to be easy, but there wasn’t a single moment in that game where I think anyone was willing to let them win. We just kind of kept fighting.”
But Middle Tennessee State (3-4) used an 8-2 run to close the final set and to take the match.
“That was a fun one,” Skelly said. “It was tough to lose, but I think our chemistry really paid off.”
Blue Raiders freshman Chelsea Ross fueled the squad’s game-ending run, scoring three of her team’s final four points. Ross notched six of her game-high 19 kills in the final set.
But Ross wasn’t the only rookie making an impact in the fifth frame. Wallace recorded three of the Crimson’s five kills in the final set. The freshman finished with 16 kills, six errors, and three digs.
“For a volleyball player at her position, she’s kind of small, but her vertical is like eight inches taller than anyone else’s,” said Skelly of Wallace, who is listed at 5’8”. “She goes up there, and she’s not afraid. We’re playing against girls five or six inches taller than her, and she’ll hit over them, off their hand—find the smart shot.”
Cooney added, “To see a freshman playing as composed as she was is very promising. She was still scoring points in high-pressure situations. She’s a really dynamic player, and it will be great to see her play more.”
Sophomore middle blocker Caroline Walters chipped in with 13 kills, and senior setter Beth Kinsella led the Crimson with 26 assists. Rookie setter Hannah Schmidt added 22 assists.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After wrapping up the 2011 season with its third Ivy League title in four years, the Harvard women’s soccer team kicked off its 2012 campaign without missing a beat.
The Crimson took down UMass (2-2-0) on Friday with a 2-0 victory at Rudd Field, thanks to goals from junior co-captain Peyton Johnson and freshman Haley Washburn.
The victory also extended the squad’s winning streak in regular-season play to 11 games.
“It was a good game for everyone,” Johnson said. “Sometimes first games can be chaotic, and everyone might not be on the same page, but we managed pretty well to connect passes, find each other, and at the same time expose things that we’re going to need to work on coming up.”
Johnson herself found success connecting with her teammates: just minutes into the second half, she combined with Washburn for her first assist of the season. The goal was Washburn’s first collegiate score.
“She was able to do exactly what she was supposed to do in her position, which was just hook it on target,” said Johnson of Washburn, who was named to the U.S. U-17 Women’s National Team in 2010. “It was a really awesome finish.”
Sophomore goalkeeper Bethany Kanten also dominated in her position, stopping all five shots on goal.
“I’ve just been working a lot on improving areas I’ve struggled with in the past—looking at last year’s goals that were scored on us, breaking those down, and seeing what went wrong,” Kanten said. “A lot of it is being a leader on the field and helping out the defense so we’re all on the same page and limiting scoring opportunities.”
Kanten and her backline limited UMass to eight total shots on the afternoon compared to Harvard’s 19 total attempts and 11 on goal.
“For our first game and [for] not having played real opponents yet, and UMass already [having] had [four] games before this…for us to come out and win and play together like we had been together just as long as they have was really great,” Kanten said.
Johnson also noted the win’s importance for her team’s newer members.
“Getting your first win under your belt, we know how it feels. Now the freshmen have their first win, which is big for them,” she explained. “It gives us the confidence we need to go forward without having to stress too much about a loss.”
Johnson also scored her first goal of the season—a free kick into the top left corner with just under 20 minutes of play left.
“There was a foul outside the box, maybe five or 10 yards outside the box, and that’s usually a pretty good place to have an opportunity,” Johnson said. “We had practiced a few this first week, and I was able to take one from there. It was a good chance.”
Following Johnson’s goal, the Minutewomen countered with one final shot from sophomore midfielder Moa Mattsson, who scored her team’s only goal in its season opener against No. 6 UCLA. But Kanten stopped the shot for her fifth and final save of the day.
With only a few weeks before Ivy League play begins, Kanten and her team are happy with the win but aware of the work that lies ahead.
“We’re going to have a lot of people in different positions,” she said. “We have a ton of talent and everyone works really hard, but we don’t know where people fit into the puzzle to make the best possible team. So I think that’s a challenge we’re going to have to face, but I think it’ll be fun to figure out where everybody fits.”
Johnson also hinted that the team cannot rest on its early success.
“Because it’s the first game, you can’t allow yourself to think too much about the result or anything beyond just starting well and getting the kinks out,” she said. “We can’t focus on the result because that’s not what matters in the first game.
“We got a win but we also have things we need to work on, “Johnson added, “and I think that’s a great position to be in.”

The  life of an email list which, at the beginning of the week, stood poised  to pester the vast majority of Harvard's student body seems to have been  brief.
  On  Monday, students found themselves receiving unsolicited subscription  notifications from a list called Anonymous-Harvard, which claimed to  have a membership of "90 percent of active Harvard undergrads."

Each message posted to the list left the identity of the sender anonymous. Eloquently  worded messages in the list's early hours ranged from "everyone wish  susanna a happy birthday RIGHT NOW" (referring to Susanna B. Wolk '14—happy birthday!) to "penis."
But all five threads and 25 posts seen by  Anonymous-Harvard were broadcast in the list's first day of life. Since  then, Samuel M. Meyer '13, who is named as the owner of the list, posted  on Facebook that the Harvard Computer Society, which hosted the list,  had "mostly shutdown" his project. The list's homepage is still  operative, but posts to the list are now bounced without being  delivered. Meyer declined to comment.
The list's short life was marked by passionate denunciations from some students. John Pulice '15 tweeted Monday, "Anonymous Harvard is the worst idea since New Coke."
And some learned the perils of false assurances of anonymity. Within  about an hour, a student made the unfortunate mistake of including her  default email signature on her so-called anonymous message. Thankfully  for Chisom Okpala '15, she only signed her name on a birthday wish, leaving the inappropriate commentary to others.
This post has been revised to reflect the following corrections:
CORRECTION: Sept. 4
An earlier version of this article said that Harvard Computer Society officers did not respond to The Crimson's requests for comment. In fact, due to a technical error, those email requests were likely not delivered.
CORRECTION: Nov. 26
An earlier version of this article misstated the class year of Samuel M. Meyer '13.
