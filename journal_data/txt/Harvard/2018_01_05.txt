After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ants: they’re creepy to some, cute to others, and inspirational to a handful of independent video game developers. In the style of classic real-time strategy (RTS) games like “Dungeon Keeper,” where players carve out an underground lair and build up their economy and military forces, indie game company Slug Disco’s newest game places the player in control of an ant colony in a number of situations. The game is framed as a nature documentary: The narrator observes as the player directs their colony to harvest food, develops a brood of ant workers and soldiers, and battles other creatures.
Though the game is still in Early Access on Steam—meaning that it is still undergoing active development—the mechanics are all in place and the game is shaping up to be a unique entry in the RTS genre. The main storyline centers on a fictional new breed of ant, formica ereptor, whose ability to incorporate the DNA of other ants into its own brood makes it an object of interest to scientists. Your home base is the formicarium, where resources are limited and must be earned through progression. The only way to evolve your brood and prepare for large-scale assaults is to take on missions outside the colony. Here is where the game’s attention to narrative game design makes what could have been a lackluster experience really shine.
In addition to the unique subject matter, the narration is another distinctive aspect of the game. While in the lab, the player is essentially left to his or her own devices apart from some commentary by the unseen scientists running their experiments on the colony. But in the wild, the narrative shifts. You control a wild ant colony being observed by a documentarian. The narration is really spot-on in this regard. The narrator’s grave tone gives the whole experience a sort of gravity it might otherwise have lacked.
In terms of systems, “Empires” plays very much like the classic RTS games which inspired it. The combat is macro-based, focusing more on amassing a large force of the correct composition of ants as opposed to careful control of any one unit. As you build out your underground empire, you are encouraged to build brood chambers in hexagonal shapes, as units can only be fully upgraded—and thus unlock powerful passive bonuses—if they are surrounded on all sides by other brood hexes. Building in the way the mechanics encourage results in a base which ultimately looks a lot like a real ant colony—something the developers surely intended, making the gaming experience even more realistic.
In its current state, “Empires of the Undergrowth” is a game worth playing, albeit a short one. Despite failing a number of times on the first mission while learning the mechanics, I completed all the available content in less than five hours of play. The developers plan to rapidly expand the number of playable scenarios, though, which means that if you like what you see, there’s no reason to suspect there won’t be enough content to justify the twenty dollar price tag by the time they’re done developing. There are no plans to increase the cost of the game on full release, but playing during early access will grant you access to the forums where you can give the developers feedback as they expand and refine the game.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Facing accusations of sexual misconduct, physician and longtime Harvard Medical School professor Harvey J. Makadon resigned from his positions on the faculty at the Medical School and staff of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center last month.
Makadon, who had taught at the Medical School for decades, was accused of misconduct by several men, including World Bank health policy strategist Armin Fidler. Fidler claims that Makadon made unwanted advances toward him in 1990, while Fidler was a student at the Harvard School of Public Health, the Boston Globe reported Monday. He wrote to Harvard to report the alleged misconduct in November.
Fidler declined to comment for this story.
Gary R. Brissette, a Chestnut Hill doctor who completed his residency at Beth Israel, alleged that Makadon inappropriately touched him in the early 1990s. Another man, a patient who saw Makadon for treatment in the late 1980s, also claims that Makadon sexually harassed him.
In an interview Wednesday, Makadon repeatedly denied sexual harassment claims made by Fidler and others.
“I have no recollection of Dr. Fidler and I certainly did not behave in the way that he described,” he said.
Makadon stepped down from his post at Beth Israel on Dec. 8, when the allegations came to light. According to Medical School spokesperson Gina Vild, Makadon’s faculty position at the Medical School was based on his hospital appointment, so when Makadon resigned from Beth Israel, his Harvard appointment ended simultaneously.
Vild declined to comment on Makadon’s individual case.  “While we are not able to discuss specific cases, be assured that we take every concern reported to us extremely seriously,” she said.
Makadon served as an LGBT advisor during his time as clinical professor of medicine at the Medical School. He also formerly worked at Fenway Health, a medical center specializing in the treatment of LGBT individuals, before he was forced to resign amid allegations that he had sexually harassed and bullied coworkers.
The Boston Globe reported that formal complaints made at Fenway Health against Makadon dated back to 2013. Twice since then, Fenway Health commissioned external law firms to investigate the allegations against Makadon. One of these investigations, in 2015, recommended Makadon be fired.
Makadon’s resignations come as a national movement has brought heightened attention to the issue of workplace harassment and toppled powerful men in Hollywood, government, media, and the corporate world. The movement has prompted more individuals to come forward with stories of harassment, and Harvard has seen a 20 percent increase in sexual harassment complaints since it began.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
New documents Harvard filed with Boston’s urban planning agency last month offer a glimpse into the University’s plans for its “Enterprise Research Campus,” a proposed 36-acre center for entrepreneurship in Allston.
The area will largely serve as a “venue for research-based businesses,” according to the filings. But Harvard’s long-term vision for the campus also centers around transportation: The University intends to expand existing public transit options and create an environment more friendly to bikers and pedestrians.
The 59-page document—titled the “Enterprise Research Campus Framework Plan”—also includes an entire section devoted to Harvard’s strategies for minimizing the impacts of climate change.
“What has been an impenetrable, impervious, vehicular-oriented superblock will soon undergo transformation from industrial use to an urban district providing economic benefit,” University officials wrote in the framework plan.
Harvard first proposed developing an enterprise research campus in Allston in 2011; since then, University has released few details about what that campus might entail. In April 2016, Harvard hired real estate agent Steven D. Fessler to serve as “head of enterprise real estate” and to guide construction of the area.
In November 2017, Harvard representatives presented plans for an initial 14-acre segment of the enterprise research campus to Allston residents at a community forum. And in December, Harvard filed its framework plan for the entire campus with the Boston Planning and Development Agency.
The University submitted this framework plan to the BPDA along with a more concrete development plan specifically for the 14-acre segment of the enterprise research campus. The former is meant to articulate Harvard’s larger “development vision,” which extends “beyond the time frame, geography and program” of the latter, according to the documents.
The framework plan runs through a quick history of the area before describing Harvard’s broad planning approach and then launching into an overview of the University’s plans. The document devotes four pages to “Land Use,” envisioning a long-term mix of residential, commercial, and research buildings in the area. The enterprise research campus will also include Harvard residential and institutional space.
The filing allots a combined 20 pages to planning for “Transportation,” “Infrastructure, Sustainability, and Resilience,” and climate change.
In order to facilitate non-automobile transit to the enterprise research campus, Harvard will broaden public transportation networks and will gradually limit automobile parking spots.
The document envisions a public transportation network that will increase “connectivity with surrounding communities” by extending Harvard’s internal shuttle system, adding a T stop called West Station, and modifying Boston bus routes to include stops in the enterprise research campus. In addition, the plan promotes walking and bicycling, proposing the creation of a “pedestrian ladder” and a network of bicycling routes connecting Harvard’s Cambridge campus to its Allston campus.
Initially, in order to accommodate cars, the enterprise research campus will feature open-air parking lots, as well as approximately 800 to 900 parking spots located underneath buildings. But the plan anticipates eventually replacing land occupied by the open-air parking lots with more buildings.
In order to combat potential effects of climate change going forward, Harvard will develop ways to conserve water and increase green space in Allston. According to the plan, the University will debut rainwater harvesting and filtration systems to manage stormwater and will plant wind-resistant trees to decrease the impact of higher temperatures. Buildings will feature elevated entrances and flood-proofing.
Harvard also stated in the framework plan that it will collaborate with Boston Water and Sewer Commission, Massachusetts Water Resource Authority, and private companies to construct various utility systems in Allston. These systems include new water mains, sanitary sewers, and a University thermal energy loop from a planned district energy facility. In order to facilitate these developments and better manage stormwater runoff, the framework plan proposes the creation of a “slight elevation change” in the enterprise research campus.
But the framework plan is by no means fixed. Noting that Harvard’s landholdings in Allston “will be developed over decades to come,” University officials wrote in the document that the plan may change going forward.
“This Framework Plan is intended as a ‘living document’ that will evolve and respond to new ideas and changing conditions,” officials wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Management Company has sold its majority stake in a portfolio of properties scattered around New York City to Blackstone Group for nearly $244 million, according to documents filed with the city Wednesday.
A&E Real Estate Holdings and Edge Principal Advisors hold minority stakes in the 13-building portfolio, which includes buildings in Manhattan and Queens.
According to The Real Deal, a real estate news site, the buildings are part of two portfolios that A&E acquired in 2013 and 2015. A&E is one of the city’s largest landlords and owns more than 200 buildings. In documents filed with the city, all but one of the buildings are classified as apartment buildings.
The sale comes after HMC decided to spin off its real estate management arm to Bain Capital. In February, former HMC employees will start a group at Bain to manage HMC’s $3.4 billion real estate portfolio.
Last May, Bloomberg reported HMC was planning to sell around $1.6 billion in real estate assets, despite experts’ predictions that HMC would increase reliance on alternative assets. Analysts said the endowment's new CEO N.P. Narvekar, who arrived at Harvard in Dec. 2016, might be more likely to shift towards alternative assets given  his history of specializing in hedge funds, private equity, and real estate.
The sale comes at the end of a tumultuous year for the endowment, during which HMC shrunk its internal staff, implemented a generalist management structure, and transitioned some of its portfolios so they fall under management by external companies.
A spokesperson for HMC declined to comment on the sale Friday.
