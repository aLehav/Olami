After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Jan. 11, 2019 at 10:21 p.m.
After roughly 3,000 graduate students received an erroneous stipend payment from Harvard in December, some incurred overdraft fees when administrators reversed the error.
Mistaken deposits appeared in students’ accounts beginning Dec. 14, and University officials discovered the error on Dec. 17. The Central Payroll Office — which handles wage and stipend payments for Harvard employees — informed current and former students who received the deposits about the error on Dec. 18.
The administrative mixup drew criticism from the newly formed graduate student union and prompted the University to evaluate its payroll procedures.
Harvard spokesperson Jonathan Swain wrote in an emailed statement that Central Payroll reimbursed students who mistakenly received overdraft fees — which result when money is withdrawn from an account and the balance drops below zero — and is “taking this as an opportunity to examine its internal processes and evaluate where it can strengthen controls to prevent similar errors in the future.”
“The University acted quickly to both correct the erroneous payments and communicate to the impacted individuals as soon as the error was discovered,” he wrote. “The University understands that while this payment did not impact any current student’s regularly scheduled stipend payment on Dec. 21, the erroneous deposit and payment reversal did create issues for some individuals and it has taken steps to address those quickly.”
Nineteen individuals have requested reimbursements — totaling $848 — as of Friday, according to Swain.
In a Facebook post, Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Auto Workers cited the cost these administrative errors posed to students as one reason they “need a #contractnow”.
“These administrative delays, errors, and oversight have big impacts on student workers’ financial status,” Belle Cheves, a union representative and PhD candidate in History, wrote in an email. ”We formed a Union so that student workers have the power to negotiate with the administration to respond to issues like these.”
Some of the affected students said the error caused only a minor inconvenience.
“The event didn't affect me that much beyond some confusion,” Jacob L. Austerman, a PhD candidate in Molecular and Cellular Biology, wrote in an email. But he noted that “for a student living on a small amount of money, this overdraft fee could be a significant cost.”
Tsitsi M. Mangosho, a PhD candidate in History and a Law School student, said she got a notification about the deposit in mid-December, but, with her busy schedule and multiple accounts, did not realize it was an error. After she paid her credit card bills with the deposited funds, she incurred a $105 overdraft fee when Central Payroll withdrew her stipend payment.
“Initially, with the $105, I pretty much freaked out, because each day they charge you a certain amount if your account is in overdraft,” she said. “I ended up having to borrow from a friend so I could cover that $105.”
After Mangosho called, the bank reduced the fee to $35. She said she then saw a post on HGSU-UAW's Facebook page asking students affected by the issue to contact the union. When Mangosho reached out to the union, a union representative contacted Harvard for her to arrange a refund of the overdraft fee.
“I think if I had had to go to Harvard directly, I might not have done it,” Mangosho said. “Once someone from the union did it, it became much easier because I didn’t have to do anything.”

Twenty One Pilots, Travis Scott, and Tame Impala will headline this year’s Boston Calling music festival Memorial Day weekend in “a lineup of epic proportions,” festival organizers announced in a press release Thursday.
Alongside the three headliners, this year’s festival — which will be held at the Harvard Athletic Complex from May 24 to May 26 — will feature more than 50 additional performances including rapper Logic, indie musician Hozier, electronic group Odesza, and pop artist Janelle Monae.
Seven 2019 Grammy nominees are set to perform, including headliner Travis Scott, who was nominated for the song “Sicko Mode” and the album “Astroworld.” Brandi Carlile, the most nominated female musician of the 2019 Grammys, will also perform.
This year’s Boston Calling will also feature several comedians — including Fred Armisen and Melissa Villaseñor — and a show by the Boston Ballet Company. English singer-songwriter Imogen Heap will present a spoken-word performance with her Mi.Mu gloves, a technology that translates hand movements and gestures into sound.
Boston Calling began as a biannual festival in 2013. In 2017, the event both moved to the Harvard Athletic Complex and became an annual event. The past two years have seen enormous growth for the festival: In 2018, roughly 40,000 people attended the festival to see headliners The Killers, Jack White, and Eminem.
Boston Calling Events co-founder Brian Appel said in the press release that he and his colleagues aim to “bring the festival to greater heights” each year.
“We love the artists that have been assembled for 2019, and look forward to welcoming back many of our favorites from past editions,” Appel said.

Harvard University Health Services Director Paul J. Barreira will step down June 30 after seven years in the position, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 and Executive Vice President Katie Lapp announced in an email sent to Harvard affiliates Thursday.
During his 15 years at the University, Barreira has served as director of Behavioral Health and Academic Counseling at HUHS, overseeing Student Mental Health Services, Alcohol and Other Drug Services, the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, the Center for Wellness, and the Bureau of Study Counsel. He also served as an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School for eight years prior to being appointed HUHS director in 2012.
“Paul has significantly enhanced Harvard’s commitment to student health,” Garber and Lapp wrote in the university-wide email. “As director, Paul has advanced HUHS’s mission to provide compassionate, high-quality care and to support the health and well-being of Harvard’s diverse patient populations.”
Garber and Lapp praised Barreira’s leadership as HUHS grappled with urgent public health issues — most notably, the Ebola epidemic in 2014 and the mumps outbreak on campus in 2016.
“Its [HUHS’s] response to the mumps outbreak at Harvard in 2016 has been nationally recognized as a model for universities to combat future outbreaks,” Garber and Lapp wrote. “HUHS was also the first university health service to develop a protocol to evaluate community members who returned to campus from affected countries during the Ebola outbreak in 2014.”
In a separate letter announcing his resignation, Barreira reflected upon a tenure that he said had “stretched, and challenged, and humbled” him.
“I feel so fortunate to have spent the last seven years of my career in this role,” Barreira wrote in the letter, which was posted to the HUHS website Thursday. “Most of all, I have been inspired to work with such an extraordinary group of caregivers and human beings.”
As director, Barreira witnessed the completion of the Smith Campus Center, which houses HUHS, expanded the University’s Counseling and Mental Health Services, and implemented processes including a safety-reporting system and a data-sharing program to increase overall effectiveness in executing HUHS operations. He was known for his “student-centered approach,” according to Garber and Lapp, and sought student feedback when making changes to health services programs.
Barbara Lewis, chief of counseling and mental health services at HUHS, wrote in an email to The Crimson that Barreira “has been a tremendous support” in her role as chief of CAMHS and that she will miss “his energy and enthusiasm” as well as “the opportunities to learn more by watching him lead HUHS.”
“I’m thrilled for Paul to have the opportunity to pursue other interests and to spend more time with his wife and daughter,” Lewis wrote. “Paul has been such an important advocate for students’ mental health needs and in helping CAMHS provide more robust services. He really knows and understands what it means to provide counseling and he is passionate about improving our services.”
During the next few weeks, the University will appoint a committee to search for Barreira’s successor, according to Garber and Lapp. Barreira wrote in his letter that he looks forward to the transition.
“I know that you will not only thrive, but also grow, with new leadership,” he wrote.

Harvard announced the slate of candidates in contention for positions on its Board of Overseers — the University’s second highest governing board — and elected directorships in the Harvard Alumni Association Thursday.
The Board of Overseers’ responsibilities include advising top Harvard administrators, providing input on decisions about the direction of the University, and approving certain actions by the University’s highest governing body, the Harvard Corporation. Members of the board serve six-year terms.
The nominees — all Harvard alumni — come from a variety of professional fields and live in the United States or Europe. This year’s nine overseer nominees include founder and CEO of nonprofit Girls Who Code Reshma M. Saujani, partner for McKinsey & Company Vivian Y. Hunt ’89, president and CEO of the Education Trust John B. King ’96, director of the Iowa Department of Education Ryan M. Wise, private equity executive Scott C. Collins ’87, chief medical officer for the San Francisco Health Network Alice H. Chen, director of the MIT Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research Tyler E. Jacks ’83, biotechnology executive Danguole J. Altman ’81, and visual artist Janet S. Echelman ’87.
Though the Harvard Alumni Association usually nominates eight candidates, this year saw nine nominations to reflect current overseer James E. Hildreth's ’79 early resignation due to professional obligations. In addition to Hildreth, the six candidates elected will replace outgoing members Susan L. Carney ’73, Christopher B. Field ’75, Deanna Lee ’84, Sanjay H. Patel ’83, and Gwill E. York ’79.
Hildreth is not the first overseer to step down early. Former overseer Kathryn “Kat” A. Taylor ’80 resigned from her post in May, just one day before her term ended, in protest of what she called Harvard’s “failure” to “adopt ethical commitments” when investing its endowment.
Elected directors of the Harvard Alumni Association will serve as representatives of the general alumni community. The nominees include real estate investor George C. Alex ’81, manager for Ford Smart Mobility Bryan C. Barnhill II ’08, Attorney General of The Navajo Nation Ethel B. Branch ’01, partner at Hogan Lovells Salomé Cisnal de Ugarte, partner at Thompson & Knight LLP Adrienne E. Dominguez ’90, assistant director at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Michael J. Gaw ’90, social entrepreneur Christina Lewis ’02, consultant Zandile H. Moyo ’00, and Harvard Business School lecturer Derek C.M. van Bever.
All Harvard degree holders — except those Harvard Corporation members and those in University governance positions — are eligible to vote in the election via mail-in ballot. Additional candidates can also be nominated through a petition process.
University administrators will mail ballots to eligible voters by April 1, and alumni must complete and return their ballots by May 21.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Legal Defense and Educational Fund argued that Harvard’s race-conscious admissions process is “necessary to reap the educational benefits of diversity” in a document filed in federal court Wednesday.
The filing — submitted months after a trial in the case wrapped up — marks the latest development in a lawsuit that has lasted years and could determine the fate of affirmative action at private colleges and universities around the country. Plaintiff Students for Fair Admissions originally filed suit against Harvard in 2014, arguing the College’s admissions protocols discriminate against Asian-American applicants.
LDF represents 25 Harvard student and alumni organizations comprising thousands of Asian-American, black, Latinx, Native-American, and white students and alumni as amici curiae — friends of the court — in the lawsuit. The amicus brief offers evidence to support the claim that the College’s race-conscious admissions process safeguards diversity on campus, an argument also made by lawyers representing Harvard during the trial.
The NAACP LDF is one of the scores of third-party organizations to weigh in on the admissions suit. In addition to an amicus brief filed by the LDF in September, filings from 16 of the nation's top schools, the American Civil Liberties Union, and 15 economists and 531 social scientists have backed Harvard’s position. The Department of Justice, five economists, and multiple conservative think tanks including the National Association of Scholars sided with SFFA — as did the Asian American Coalition for Education, which penned a brief in July on behalf of 156 Asian-American organizations.
LDF’s latest amicus brief brief comes after Harvard College and SFFA each submitted their own findings of fact and conclusions of law — documents summarizing what each side saw as the key takeaways from the trial, held in Boston for three weeks starting in mid-October. Those filings, like the LDF’s, included lawyers’ summaries of both factual discoveries and legal conclusions.
The LDF’s 45 page-long amicus brief argues that no race-neutral alternative to the College’s protocols would achieve sufficient levels of diversity in the College’s student body. It contends that engagement with, and exposure to, students of different racial and ethnic backgrounds are “critical” to achieving the educational benefits of diversity.
The loss of race-conscious admissions would contribute to the “loss of up to fifty percent of the Black and Latinx student body,” according to the amicus brief. LDF lawyers argued this shift in the student body’s makeup would reduce students’ opportunities to engage in “meaningful interactions and dialogue” with diverse peers.
In the amicus brief, lawyers for LDF frequently cited the five current undergraduates who testified in support of Harvard’s admissions process during the trial. Quoting testimony from Cecilia A.J. Nuñez ’20, lawyers argued that diverse classrooms encourage students to “learn from other people, and . . . learn from listening to their stories” — a crucial element, they argue, to avoiding racial isolationism and tokenization.
“The main thing that we want to point out to the judge is the situation that the Supreme Court has told us for 40 years that colleges and universities can lawfully consider race as one of many factors in college admissions in the pursuit of the educational benefits of diversity so long as there are no available and workable alternatives to putting together a diverse student body,” Michaele Turnage Young, senior counsel at the NAACP LDF, said.
The brief argues that SFFA did not provide evidence at trial to counter the argument that a decrease in diversity would harm students’ educational experiences.
SFFA President Edward Blum did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.
Young said LDF’s lawyers submitted the amicus brief to distill main takeaways from the trial ahead of a final hearing, scheduled for Feb. 13, during which lawyers representing Harvard and SFFA will make post-trial closing arguments about factual findings thus far in the lawsuit and the legal rulings they believe the court should make.
United States Federal District Judge Allison D. Burroughs is expected to issue her decision in the months following this hearing. Legal experts have said they expect that whichever side loses will appeal, and the case could end up in front of the U.S. Supreme Court.
CORRECTION: Jan. 11, 2019
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated LDF is a part of the NAACP. In fact, LDF is a separate organization from the NAACP.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PRINCETON, N.J. — One minute into the third period, and just seven seconds into a Princeton man advantage, senior forward Alex Riche golfed a loose puck past Harvard net-minder Michael Lackey. The puck had rebounded into the slot, idling at the feet of Crimson freshman Jack Drury where it was waiting to be whacked in.
Riche’s fifth tally of the season proved to be the game-winner on Friday night at the Hobey Baker Rink. The Tigers (6-10-2, 4-6-1 ECAC), who added an empty-net goal in the waning minutes, overcame the Crimson (6-5-3, 3-4-2) by a final mark of 4-2, taking the season series against Harvard with their first win against the Ivy League rival since 2013.
“We gave up goals too easily,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “We took some penalties, to me, that weren’t necessary…. Really, that was the difference in the game. They get the two powerplay goals.”
Although the teams entered the first intermission notched at 1-1, the stalemate did not last long. One minute into the middle frame, Princeton forward Liam Grande broke into the zone and shoved a backhanded shot into the pads of Lackey. While Lackey kept out the initial chance, Grande’s linemate, sophomore Luke Keenan, crashed the net and punched home the rebound for another early-period strike.
“[Early-period goals] are daggers,” co-captain Michael Floodstrand said. “You have to really learn to keep a level head when those things happen. Those are things that we have to tighten up on. We had a great shift there in the first minute of the second, and they get a fortunate bounce.”
Just as in the first stanza, though, the teams traded scores in the second period. Twelve seconds into a Harvard powerplay, junior defenseman Adam Fox sent a one-timer from the point toward the net, where it beat Princeton goaltender Ryan Ferland. Fox, a prolific offensive blue-liner, sits second in the nation in points per game (1.57).
Through 14 contests in 2018-2019, the Crimson has struck on the powerplay in all but three tilts. After a one-for-four performance, Harvard’s lethal man-up unit continues to lead the NCAA in effectiveness (35.2%).
“The powerplay has been huge for us all year,” Floodstrand said. “We’ve got so much talent on there…. They’ve done a hell of a job the entire year.”
The Crimson opened the scoring for the eighth time this season. Five minutes into the tilt, Drury won an offensive draw, giving linemate Frédéric Grégoire a lane to shoot through traffic. The junior’s wrister made it through the noise in front of Ferland and found twine.
“It’s one of a bunch of faceoff plays,” coach Donato said. “They all look good when you win the draw clean like that, so good shot by Freddie [Grégoire], nice faceoff win by Drury.”
Just over two minutes later, the Tigers erased the early Harvard lead after a Derek Topatigh slapshot from the point beat the left pad of Lackey.
When the two teams met for the first time this season — a 4-4 tie in early November — Princeton’s star wingers, Ryan Kuffner (13–13—26) and Max Véronneau (7–17—24), left their mark on the contest. The senior alternate captains combined for seven points and proved deadly on the man advantage.
Friday night, the Crimson kept the Tigers’ two offensive workhorses in check, relatively speaking. Kuffner and Véronneau, both pre-season All-ECAC selections, totaled just two points between them including Kuffner’s empty-net dagger with a minute remaining in the bout.
“First and foremost, if [shutting down Kuffner and Véronneau] is not a point of emphasis, we’d be fools,” coach Donato said. “They finished third and fourth in the country last year in points. I thought we did a better job of not giving them easy offense. Ultimately, though, if they had two-and-two tonight and we won 5-4, I’d be a lot happier.”
In the second half of the first period, Princeton had an opportunity to seize a 2-1 lead. With Lackey down and out, the net was all but empty for a Tigers forward ready to bury the puck. Harvard forward Justin Szeto, however, dove past the crease and thwarted the sure tally with an extra-effort play, keeping the score even at one.
Plays like Szeto’s kept the Crimson in the game, but the squad simply did not get the offensive production it needed to match Princeton.
“The biggest thing for us now is not to get frustrated,” Floodstrand said. “[Scoring] is going to come, without a doubt, but you have to tighten up other areas of your game for that stuff to come out.”
Harvard turns to No. 6 Quinnipiac on Saturday night in a crucial ECAC matchup and measuring-stick game.
