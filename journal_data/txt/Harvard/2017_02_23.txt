After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This week’s Episodes of “The Young Pope” were a pair of mismatched socks. Episode Five was an overly lethargic exploration of Belardo’s friendship with his childhood best friend, Dussolier—a cardinal recently relocated to Vatican City—that culminated in an explosive ending. Episode Six, by contrast, picked up the pace immediately and ran with it until its final moments. The show continues to vacillate in style, and the more episodes that pass, the less cohesive the growth appears. While Episode Six easily ranks as one of the best episodes of the show, Episode Five’s lethargy undoubtedly sinks it to the bottom. Jude Law’s performance is the only consistency that has carried through the show while promising figures like Diane Keaton’s Sister Mary and Scott Shepherd’s Cardinal Dussolier fail to meet expectations.
Episode Five was a gratuitous exploration of Belardo’s abandonment. For the majority of the episode, Belardo and Dussolier jump back and forth in their memories to their time at the orphanage. Belardo is obsessed with finding his parents, a plotline that has begun to wear thin. The arrival of the papal tiara is the final piece that allows Belardo to give his speech to the cardinals. Belardo’s refusal to address the cardinals was a storyline emphasized back in the first episodes that by this time had been stretched so far the urgency was entirely lost. Prior to his speech, the “Young Pope” returns to its stylistic roots with a montage of Belardo gaudily adorning himself to LMFAO’s “Sexy and I know It.”
The episode’s shock factor was built on the same visual tropes that the “Young Pope” defined in its first two episodes. Scenes like the aforementioned montage thus fall a little flat-footed or end up on the contrived side of the line that the show has been toeing. Dussolier and Belardo lack the chemistry of best friends. There is no tangible affection;  there is no sense of history. When they wander through Vatican City in their tracksuits, they might as well be two recently met acquaintances rather than two men close enough to be brothers reconnecting after time away.
The episode was built around exploring these emotional attachments. If they had been stronger, the choice to slow down the episode to a glacial pace prior to the ending might have been an interesting change of pace rather than a confounding choice. As is the structure of plot development—most of which occurs in the last five or so minutes. Belardo sits down for a candlelit dinner with a shepherd who has been curing people of disease. The character was introduced earlier in a prior episode as an interesting foil to the Catholic Church—he threatened to start his own church if he went unacknowledged by the Pope. It seems, however, that Belardo has caved here.
Episode Six picks up with a blitzkrieg of events that occur nine months after we last left off. A cardinal dies and face plants into his oatmeal. Esther gives birth to a baby. Belardo drops the baby. The show finally dives into the complex political drama that it has been skirting around for the past episodes. Instead of picking up the storylines that ended Episode Five, Episode Six focuses on the Italian prime minister (Stefano Accorsi) as a rival to Belardo and the Church’s power, and Belardo’s effort to root out all perceived gay clergy in a witch hunt. The Italian Prime Minister and Belardo engage in the most interesting verbal sparring to date. When the Prime Minister rattles off all the things he can do to subjugate the Church, he emerges as one of the first potent adversaries to Belardo that the show has produced. Belardo’s ability to hold his own, however, feels like a wasted opportunity to further his character and watch him in a moment of weakness.
Meanwhile, Belardo has comically misplaced Dussolier to lead his witch hunt against “sexual deviance”—in the first ten minutes of the episode Dussolier is engaged in a threesome with a man and woman. However, Dussolier still carries out Belardo’s wishes. In its conclusion, a young man interested in joining the Church is presumed to be gay and is rejected. He subsequently jumps to his death from the heights of the Vatican. The continued attempts of the “Young Pope” to be topically relevant by tackling the functioning of a highly conservative institution is thematically explored through the political conflicts between the church and the Italian Prime Minister. However, the issue is tackled emotionally in the outcome of the witch hunt.
Like Belardo, after he drops Esther’s baby and exclaims that he only knows how to bless infants, not hold them, it seems that the “Young Pope” only knows how to open stories. Past the halfway point, it will be interesting to see whether the show is able to deftly maneuver and develop its plot lines or whether it will carelessly let some fall to the floor.

Dear Damien Chazelle,
A few weeks ago in December, right before the semester ended for Winter Break, two of my friends and I went to watch “La La Land” in Kendall Square. We were so excited about it that we bought tickets online a week in advance. In the theater, throughout the entirety of the movie, we periodically clutched each other’s hands and sank into our seats. At the end, while the credits rolled and the rest of the audience began to file toward the door, we sat in our seats, totally silent, shell-shocked.
I sometimes joke that learning how to review movies has ruined my movie-watching experience, because instead of simply enjoying a film, I’ve trained myself to evaluate every aspect, and my mental “reviewer” voice doesn’t know how to shut off when I’m not on assignment.
But while I was watching “La La Land,” I found that my internal critical voice fell silent, and I was completely immersed in the world that you built so deftly and portrayed so beautifully. Everything about the film—the acting, dancing, music, cinematography—was carefully tailored to create such a moving and poignant piece of art. Before “La La Land,” I had never seen a movie that completely rewrote the way I thought about film, about love and work and dreams, about what it means to be an artist.
I realized, over the course of a few weeks, that the film affected me more profoundly than I had at first perceived. I have aspired since childhood to make a living as an artist of some kind—a novelist, a filmmaker, a screenwriter—and those aspirations only intensified upon coming to Harvard. Suddenly those aspirations existed as more than abstract future possibilities, and became more focused into real, potential career paths. Somewhat ironically, while on Christmas vacation in Los Angeles, I found myself watching screenwriting tutorials and film analysis videos, Googling filmmakers, trying to understand how great movies are made.
However, as I have been reminded time and time again, life as an artist is characterized prominently by risk. It is a life heavily shaded by cynicism, cloaked in the very real possibility of failure. I saw that in Mia and Sebastian’s story as I watched their respective careers unfold. I see it in my favorite filmmakers, actors, musicians, and writers. Despite the fact that I am fortunate enough to attend a prestigious liberal arts institution that supports the arts in education, I still feel as though the potential for failure extends discomfitingly far.
At the same time, though, I know I would regret being resigned to a more typical desk job if it meant sacrificing the pursuit of my passion. As “La La Land” has demonstrated to me, if dreamers can create great art, then there seems to be no question that creation is worth all the risk in the world. Briefly put, art matters, and so too do artists—perhaps now more than ever.
I understand that you are incredibly busy, especially in the midst of a buzzing awards season (congratulations on your recent Golden Globe win! I was rooting for you from my couch and giddily texting my friends). However, I wanted to reach out to you and let you know how deeply your film touched me, and how it has likely changed the course of my personal career and my life, irrevocably.
I wish you the best of luck with “La La Land” and all of your future endeavors.
Best,
Caroline Tsai

The South Asian Association’s Ghungroo 2017 Production has arrived. This annual showcase of South Asian performances has a devoted following in the Harvard community. The Harvard Crimson sat down with S.A.A. President and Co-Producer Vinay S. Iyengar '18 and Nisha T Swarup '18 to ask for their perspectives on the event as a whole.
The Harvard Crimson: What has been the most rewarding part of your experience as a co-producer?
Nisha Swarup: I think the most rewarding experience is how much people love Ghungroo. My roommates ... talk about how inclusive it is of people who’ve never danced before or had any relation to South Asian culture before. I think it’s one of the few activities on campus where people make friends with people in their clubs for a short period of time after freshman year when that dies down. I think that’s a really great part of the show and it’s really exciting to see that magic happen. It’s really rewarding to see the audience members have a lot of fun every night of the show.
Vinay Iyengar: The most rewarding part is the community that comes out of this shared experience that we’re putting on together. It’s really cool to see this diverse group—cross-year, cross-interest—come together.
THC: How has the production changed as you’ve participated throughout the years?
VI: I think in the past two years, the quality of the performance has gone up. I’ve talked to alumni and others who have gone to the show for a while—Ghungroo was founded in 1986—and what everyone has told me is that the show has consistently gotten better and better: the quality of the dances, the quality of the music performances, the skit that threads the show together. Increasingly, we’ve tried to focus on social activism and awareness every year. For example, last year our skit was about mental health in the South Asian community, and that’s something that’s always been stigmatized, particularly in South Asian immigrant families. This year is a little lighter. We have a lot going on in the political climate right now, and a lot of it affects immigrants and members of the South Asian community and Muslims in our community; we’ve been talking a lot about the current issues with immigration, and the S.A.A. issued a statement and sponsored events around it. A portion of the proceeds for Ghungroo this year will be donated to the International Rescue Committee in an effort to help refugees around the world after these crises. The way people have been thinking of the show has been developing as to display this “power of good” drawn from all these diverse individuals. We’re starting to think how to use this platform to really make a difference.
THC: What is your favorite part of the night?
NS: My favorite part of the night is seeing people hanging out backstage and seeing people who didn’t know each other before the performance becoming friends. You’re putting on this production that acts as a model for what a truly inclusive community at Harvard looks like.
THC: As both of you are juniors, can one of you talk about your thoughts on the Senior Dance, as you may be a part of it next year?
VI: Absolutely, I think Senior Dance might be my favorite part of Ghungroo, and what’s really incredible about it is that the majority of senior dancers are non-South Asian. They have little exposure to South Asian culture, Bollywood dance, or anything like this. Their friends talked about doing it as this sort of senior year rite of passage, hundreds of dancers [who have] never danced before come together in these few weeks, and watching the performance—it’s actually pretty good. You can tell that people are having a lot of fun. Without a doubt, I’ll be a part of Senior Dance next year; wouldn’t miss it for the world.
THC: What does the Ghungroo community mean to you?
NS: Freshman year, I was a representative to S.A.A. but didn’t really become involved in the community or make close friendships until Ghungroo. That’s a sentiment echoed by past producers, for example, the President of the S.A.A. during my freshman year said that she was not involved at all until the production of Ghungroo. Now, as a producer, I get to pay that back to future freshmen and use Ghungroo to bring them into our community. It’s exciting because I can remember how that was for me freshman year.
THC: How much time is devoted before the performance? How do you balance it with class?
VI: In terms of producing it’s hard for me to say exactly how much time it takes. I get a lot of emails in a day that I have to respond to, and that’s tough. It’s at least ten to fifteen hours a week managing S.A.A. and Ghungroo. I’m also dancing in the show, and that’s four or five hours of rehearsal each week in the months of January and February.
THC: How can students get involved in Ghungroo?
VI: The effort starts really early. The S.A.A. has a lot of freshman-focused events, working at events like the Activities Fair. We make an effort to get people involved early on in S.A.A.: events, study breaks, parties, et cetera. Ghungroo then acts as a spring semester integration into the South Asian community. I think one thing we’d like to work on is taking the diversity of South Asian and non-South Asian members of the Senior dance and reflecting it onto the freshman class. What happens is that you get this group of freshmen and sophomores, mostly of South Asian descent, and they start bringing in their friends later on.

On Feb. 18, The Boston Modern Orchestra Project organized an orchestral series, “Glass Works” at the New England Conservatory, dedicated to Phillip Glass. BMOP is a premiere orchestra in the United States renowned for its commitment to the growth and promotion of twentieth and twenty-first century orchestral music. The concert featured works by Phillip Glass along with the winner of this year’s BMOP-NEC Composition Competition, Benjamin Park. The highlight of the show was certainly Glass’ Movement II in the Tirol Concerto; Russian composer Anton Batagov delivered a breathtaking performance on the piano, doing complete justice to Glass’ work of art.
The first Glass performance was a Boston premiere of Tirol Concerto followed by Symphony No. 2. Each comprised three movements and was conducted by Artistic Director Gil Rose, who founded BMOP in 1996. While the ensemble in Tirol Concerto is unusually small compared to Glass’ other orchestral work, all three movements, especially the second, feature many of Glass’ signature gestures. The second movement began with the light humming of the violin, steadily progressing towards the piano entrance close to the two-minute mark. Batagov’s calm entrance with the piano immediately added a soulful depth to the music. As the pace increased, the music initiated a steady and rich evolution, creating a distinctly natural and enchanting aura. The skillful maneuvering of the high notes on the piano, essential to the second Movement, was delivered impeccably by Bagatov. What is most appealing about the second Movement is that along with Glass’ signature minimalistic structure, the music carries a mellow overtone and still manages to oscillate with a gentle, yet firm, melancholic energy. The steady wave of emotion can be felt surging to the heights and descending gracefully to the troughs, abandoning neither its elegance nor its energy. At no point did the movement lack substance. The first and third Movements in the Tirol Concerto did not feature the soothing quality of the second, but instead offered a livelier, playful and jazzy atmosphere. Batagov’s performance was once again remarkable; he was met with a thunderous applause after the piano faded out in the third Movement and an encore performance took place in which he played the piano solo for the film score of “The Hours,” also written by Glass.
Benjamin Park’s “The Dwarf Planets” turned out to be a somewhat unusual, but unique, style of composition. The first piece, “Pluto,” began with an intense—and somewhat frightening— resounding of the drums and carried on with an ominous tone. “Eris” was similar, except its chaotic nature was much more pronounced, with layers of sound creating an overwhelmingly tumultuous fire of music. It might not have been particularly easy to listen to but it certainly captured an essence of strife and mischief. The rest of the pieces were similarly brusque and sporadic, making it hard to make much sense of the structure and rhythm.
Overall, BMOP’s “Glass Works” succeeded not only as a decent concert, but also as a tribute to a twentieth century musical genius and a platform for the promotion of new musicians.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It began with an invitation sealed with an animal head pressed in wax. A scrawling hand instructed me to don jacket and tie and arrive at a building down Mount Auburn Street at half past six. Inside I made feeble attempts at small talk and plucked chicken wellingtons from silver trays.
Another invitation wormed its way under my door. Why me? I thought.
The second event, lunch at the estate of an ancient Boston bloodline, made clear why I had been chosen: I found my name at the table set aside for prospective conquests. After lunch, my peers—“punches”—swarmed the patio and glad-handed club members between sips of Bloody Marys. I stood to the side with an arthritic Beagle, which, warming to me, humped my chinos until the owner pried it from my leg.
In that moment, I could only think how ridiculous this scene appeared—all my classmates striving to outplay, outshake, outhump one another for a place in this strange, cold constellation. I emailed a senior member to withdraw my name from consideration.
A few months later, the same member invited me to drinks in the clubhouse. The power of the place pulled me back. Had I made a mistake in refusing this august social order? The senior handed me a series of gin fizzes and introduced me to other members and their guests. Later he gave his fair-haired friends a practiced look and they ushered us out into the Square, laughing and blowing smoke into the night.
I found myself in the senior’s room. He pushed me to the bed. The horizontality triggered instant vertigo and bile flooded my throat. Shoving past him, I jumped for the door and the hallway bathroom. Locked in a stall, draped over the toilet, my time at Harvard drained to a two-year low. But that night I was lucky, and the senior marched me briskly out.
Last month, Former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 withdrew his motion that sought to undercut the Administration’s proposed social club sanctions in response to the announcement that a faculty subcommittee will review the penalties. Lewis is right to point out that the sanctions—which include bans on leadership positions and recommendations for prestigious fellowships—demand rethinking. Indiscriminate targeting of all single-gender groups fails to match the nuances of Harvard’s undergraduate social life. But this doesn’t mean final clubs should escape criticism.
Lewis has asked for clarification as to “what ‘problems’ need to be solved.” Let me suggest some problems from personal experience: sexual assault, a culture of exclusivity, discrimination. Understanding how these aspects of the clubs interrelate is not absurd—in fact, it explains why the organizations are so harmful.
If the College adopts sanctions similar to those that have been proposed, students of the future will be forced to consider the sacrifices that club membership will require. And while such regulations appear revolutionary, they simply bring to the surface a choice we all must make about how to invest our precious, finite time at college. Will we choose to hold social and economic advantage over our peers? And if we want to be leaders on campus, can exclusion for the sake of exclusion be compatible with building community?
These questions don't leave us when we graduate. In Silicon Valley, making more money in my first year than my dad did after three decades of teaching, I couldn’t understand why playing by Harvard’s rules had left me so profoundly adrift. I had bagged the most exclusive job offer I could find as my classmates wished me luck with envious smiles. But perched in a glass tower in front of a glass screen, I knew I had betrayed the instinct that steered me away from final clubs in the first place. The allure of being set apart from others, of holding on to something few could possess, had marooned me among palm trees and Tesla SUVs.
I needed to imagine an alternative to Silicon Valley and get closer to issues of justice and equality. I quit my job and headed to North Carolina, a swing state mired in anti-LGBTQ legislation and racist voting restrictions.
Community organizing brought me to the doors of the wealthiest and poorest in Appalachia. I bloomed and burned each day with visions of what we could do to make all these lives richer, and I tied myself to the hope that our work could bring that day closer.
It is time that we imagine an alternative for Harvard. Our current system is broken: we teach Harvard students that “success” so often means committing social and sexual violence, and then we scratch our heads when we visit these sins upon each other on campus and after graduation. A girl in my House was raped. A kid in the Quad told me that because he alone in his blocking group wasn’t in a club, he would always be pitied for being second-class. We must do better. A safer and more inclusive university is not beyond the horizon. The most exclusive club is open to all.

Kind and caring
Elegant and nice
Lovely and pretty
Special, oh so special
Intelligent
Especially something. I don't know what.
I found this poem last summer while decluttering my Yahoo inbox. It’s part of an email I wrote in fourth grade to my friend, Kelsie. The email includes lines like, “I can see the glitter in your eyes,” and, “Your laugh echoes in my mind, and oh, your steady voice is soft.” I had no memory of writing it.
Fast-forward two months. I was bored and showed the ridiculous email to one of my friends, hoping she might get a laugh out of my cheesy writing. While she was reading it, our other friend came over and asked what we were doing. Without missing a beat, the first friend replied, “Reading this love letter Becina wrote when she was little.”
Love letter? I could feel the record scratching in my head. This wasn’t a love letter. This was the rambling of a nine-year-old who didn’t know how to filter her thoughts. This was terrible poetry written by a girl who happened to notice and appreciate random details about her friend. Right?
Well, I guess there were some hints of romance unintentionally sprinkled in there. I suppose “glitter in your eyes” could be interpreted as a variation of the clichéd “sparkle in your eyes.” (Either that or craft time gone wrong.) Maybe “your laugh echoes in my mind” seems more fitting for a Nicholas Sparks film than a casual email between friends. And I do vaguely remember her being “special, oh so special” to me, more than anyone else in my class. And, oh my God, this was the sappiest, gayest love letter I’d ever read, and I couldn’t believe that sweet, innocent baby Becina had written it.
I wish I could say that this was the moment I realized I was queer. That would help justify my initial denial about the true meaning of the email. But I’ve actually known for a few years now.
For all my talk of being “on the right track baby [cuz] I was born this way,” I never took the time to think about what it actually means to be born this way. It means I’ve always been queer. At every age, I’ve been thinking queer thoughts, feeling queer feelings, and doing queer things. My obliviousness to this for the first fifteen years of my life doesn’t make it any less true.
The problem is, I was raised straight. My parents were progressive in the sense that they told me not to wait for Prince Charming, but to pursue an education and be independent while carefully searching for a Mr. Right who loves and respects me. That’s where the progressiveness ended. There would be no Princess Charming in my childhood fantasies and definitely no Mrs. Right in my realistic expectations. (And of course, anything outside of the gender binary wouldn't even be considered.)
I didn’t realize it could be mainstream to date someone of the same gender until I saw Glee in middle school. But, by then, I’d already heard “gay” tossed around as an insult, so I was wary of being even remotely associated with the term. Perhaps if I’d seen gay couples normalized in media before I heard all the slurs and insults, I would’ve recognized my queerness sooner.
A few weeks ago, I read a blog post about a young boy who, at the age of seven, proudly announced to his family that the Glee character Blaine Anderson was his boyfriend. When the young boy came out a few months later, he didn’t treat it as a huge or scary revelation, just a statement of fact.  His parents have supported him and, as he’s gotten older, gradually explained homophobia and slurs to him, as he’s bound to experience those at some point.
One thing that made that boy’s coming out easier is that his parents never assumed he was straight. And that’s something that many of us are guilty of when talking to other people. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve received unsolicited advice from adults and peers alike on finding a boyfriend. When we assume everyone is straight, we send the message that LGBTQ people are abnormal or nonexistent. Nine-year-old Becina heard that message loud and clear, and it erased her queer existence.
I’ve reread my email many times, looking for clues that I recognized my crush on Kelsie. So far, I’ve found nothing. I was completely oblivious.
My memories of Kelsie are fond, but I definitely don’t remember liking her as much as I implied in the email. While I have vivid memories of crushes on boys in my class, I have none of my crush on Kelsie. Because I didn’t have the proper language to describe how I felt, I just categorized her as a friend, and thus remembered her as a friend. It makes me wonder what other queer relics from my childhood have been lost forever due to insufficient language and understanding. How many crushes do I not remember? How many daydreams will I never revisit? How much life has been swept away, never to be retrieved?
Heteronormativity stole not only part of my childhood, but also part of my identity. While I may never get that back, I’m determined to help build a world where this doesn’t happen to any other kids. There are a few steps we can all take to make sure this comes true. For starters, don’t make assumptions.  Rather than asking a girl if she has a boyfriend, ask if she’s in a relationship (or don’t ask at all unless it’s relevant). Speak up when you hear a homophobic comment. If a child asks you about an LGBTQ topic, don’t treat it as a taboo; just answer their question as you would any other. Watch and talk about shows and movies that portray LGBTQ characters in a positive way.
Most importantly, find any way you can to help normalize LGBTQ culture in our greater society. End heteronormativity. It’s done enough harm.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Feb. 26, 2017, at 11:27 a.m.
Until this month, at least 1.4 million emails maintained by the Harvard Computer Society were publicly accessible. Many emails contained information that should not and most likely were not meant to be public: student grades, bank account information, copies of exams, club membership lists, and at least one Social Security number. The possible consequences of such privacy breaches are concerning, especially given that Harvard administrators, faculty, and students alike have used these lists to circulate sensitive information. While this breach of privacy was inadvertent, it should serve as a stern reminder that internet security is a dangerous and serious issue that requires urgent preventative measures.
Most disconcerting about this situation is that none of the HCS students, managers, or even college administrators realized the potential security hazards of the default public setting for email lists maintained by HCS. Originally meant for use by students and student groups, HCS lists were also used by teaching staff and administrators, an unintentional but still careless use of a service run by undergraduates. The information that was circulated by teaching staff is especially alarming because it appears to have been a potential violation of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.
Despite the questionable default settings, we do not solely fault HCS for this unfortunate situation. It is normal and acceptable for a student organization to create mailing lists for other student organizations. The lists, however, went beyond this scope: Teaching staff and students used these publicly accessible lists to share student grades, answer keys, and even Social Security numbers, and they should have reflected on potential security risks before disseminating such information. Security is the obligation of all Harvard community members, and Harvard needs to place a greater emphasis on ensuring the privacy of sensitive information by educating everyone who would potentially circulate it.
That said, HCS should use this as a learning opportunity, making serious efforts to ensure privacy and security from the earliest stages of list creation in the future. The most straightforward and beneficial change HCS could make would be to switch the default setting of email lists to private. Although groups have the responsibility for ensuring that the privacy settings match the demands of their group, a privacy-oriented default setting could help prevent accidents like these.
HCS could also stand to benefit from greater collaboration with Harvard University Information Technology. That group, Harvard's official IT arm, has recently focused on information security with measures like Harvard Key and two-step verification. Currently, HUIT has only a loose connection with HCS, even though Chief Technology Officer for the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences James H. Waldo is the organization’s faculty advisor. Although the students who run HCS may be well qualified, it is ultimately a student organization. The “pretty loose connection” James H. Waldo claims to play in advising HCS is unacceptable. Given popular demand for email list services and their importance to both informal and formal operations of the University, greater support from their faculty advisor and HUIT is well warranted.
It is ultimately the University’s responsibility to ensure the privacy and safety of students and their information. As a result, Harvard administrators, faculty, and students must all do their part to ensure that a privacy breach of this scale does not happen again. HCS should be proactive by better educating list administrators about list security settings. Students, teaching staff, and administrators can do their part by being sensible about the type of information they disseminate over publicly accessible lists. The fact that sensitive Harvard email lists remained public for years should serve as a learning experience for everyone involved, and we all should think more carefully about the security of our data to avoid such an incident in the future.
CORRECTION: Feb. 26, 2017
Due to incorrect information posted on two separate Harvard websites, a previous version of this story incorrectly indicated that James H. Waldo is the Chief Technology Officer of the University.

I remember each of my personal encounters with death: my very first pet which was a white rabbit and small enough to be cupped in my palms. My grandmother, who used to hoist me up and put me on her lap every day to teach me phonetics and the proper way to hold a pencil. My father—the love of my life, really—on a hospital bed in the quiet, early hours of morning, rendered dumb by the malignancy of his cancer. In every instance, I loved, and lost, and grieved. Hard. Losing them broke me because they mattered to me. It was painful because it was personal. It stung to tap into happy and intimate memories with them—to come to terms with the fact that from that point on, there wouldn’t be new ones.
My last encounter with death didn’t make me ache for the same reasons. He was my English teacher during my sophomore year of high school, and frankly, I didn’t really know him very well. We rarely spoke. He towered over six feet tall with the build of a teddy bear, and he always wore the same charcoal-colored cardigan, converse sneakers, and square-rimmed glasses. He was famous school-wide for his kindness, loved by his students for being more understanding than most. He had a voice that could lull you almost, but not quite to sleep during a lecture with its gentleness, because its nasal inflections were surprising and interesting and different. And it didn’t wear anger well. His voice’s quality was so naturally jovial that if he had ever tried to be disciplinary, it would have backfired and somehow sounded like a pep talk.
One of the few memories I have of him happened during class, when he opted to show us Nina Simone’s cover of the 1960’s jazz single “Feeling Good” in lieu of getting on with the next act of “Antigone.” Towards the end of the song, Nina Simone builds to a cadenza; with every breath, she charges her scatting with such power and emotion that words with absolutely no meaning somehow start to make complete lexical sense. All at once, the strange and foreign phonemes that she crafts in the spur of the moment take on the most multifaceted identities, as if sung in a language only she were fluent in. Like everyone else in the class, I was floored. I listened to Nina Simone the rest of that day. For weeks after, her contralto continued to ring in my ears.
The next time I ran into my teacher, we were walking down opposite ends of the same hallway. I had never really talked to him aside from the occasional homework question, and I found myself ambushed by the same sort of feeling that caught me at the throat whenever I met new people, a sort of anxiety that I knew all too well. I scrambled to take the few seconds before our paths intersected to decide whether or not I should say hello. Or tell him about Nina Simone. Or maybe I should just turn the corner of my mouth and look up as a sort of non-verbal acknowledgement and forego the act of talking altogether, which was scary in and of itself. But wait—if I did, how acutely should I turn the corner of my mouth? What if he didn’t notice, and didn’t return the half-smile? What would I do then?
As I sifted through the slew of “what ifs,” the few seconds that I had to act slipped through my fingers. In the end, I’d just stared at our feet walk across the floor in opposite directions. I never told him about Nina Simone, and we never shared a substantive interaction—not only that day, but for the rest of the time that I knew him.
Around two years later, I learned of his lymphoma. I cried hard when he died. My teachers and friends were sympathetic but confused, and I didn’t blame them. My reaction must’ve seemed incommensurate—it wasn’t as if we were particularly close; I barely knew the man.
But maybe that was the point. The truth of the matter was that his death jolted me into awareness. It made me all the more conscious of how I was always too afraid that what I’d say wouldn’t be intelligent enough, or substantive enough, or just plain enough. The ache that gnawed at me was a constant reminder of that time in the hallway, and of all the instances when a sense of anxiety had prevented me from sharing experiences and thoughts, from exchanging words and opinions, from starting potentially wonderful conversations.
I wish I could say that, since his death, I’ve completely changed. That I’ve mastered the art of breaking through self-consciousness to say what I mean. That I’m now perfectly able to power through the silence that’s all too comfortable to fall back on and tell people how I really feel, about the impact they’ve had on me and how grateful I am for it. But to this day, I still find myself silenced at times by the very same feeling of worry.
But ever since then, I’ve been learning. I’ve listened to that Nina Simone song at least 100 times—the texture of her voice and the emotion that she fashions feel just as entrancing as they did four years ago. I’m learning to coax out the words collecting at the back of my throat, and to truncate the thoughts collecting at the back of my mind. I’m learning to lift my eyes off the floor.
I know that I’ll never be able to tell my teacher what I wanted to say. I also know that I’ll never be able to say everything that I want to say to anyone I know, as death has an uncanny habit of catching us off guard. But I’m sure now that it’s worth it to try.

Urs Gasser, director of the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School, is not worried about artificially intelligent deathbots.
“We at Berkman Klein are less focused on the longer-term risks of ‘Big AI,’” he says, referring to the human-like intelligent systems seen in sci-fi movies. “[We are] more concerned about autonomous systems, algorithms, and other technologies that have an important effect on people’s lives right now.”
Smart, complex programs are already having big impacts on society: Algorithms help courts set bail, determine which news stories appear on Facebook users’ feeds, and sometimes decide who will be given a line of credit from a bank.
Gasser says he is concerned about the ethics of these practices. “Are judges and banks using algorithms that treat minorities unfairly?” he asks. “Is AI on social media elevating fake news in ways that are reshaping our democracy and civic dialogue?”
Yunhan Xu ’17, a research assistant at the Berkman Klein Center, also studies these questions. “One popular misconception is that if it’s an algorithm, then it’s unbiased—it has some kind of inherent objectivity,” she says. “Algorithms are not neutral. They are maximizing parameters that were chosen by the people that designed [them].”
Gasser announced last month that the Center will be working with the MIT Media Lab, the Knight Foundation, and others to start the Ethics and Governance of Artificial Intelligence Fund, which will support interdisciplinary research on bias and ethics in AI.
Many in the industry say this work has never been more necessary. “Often [AI] developments are occurring in the absence of broader conversations about societal impact, discrimination, fairness, and inclusion,” Gasser says. “Expertise in connecting diverse perspectives, disciplines, and sectors from around the world is something that is very much needed in the AI space right now.”
Xu, who will work for Google after graduation, says she is excited about supporting this research. “The discussion about the ethics of AI has been outpaced by the actual development of the technology,” she says. “A sustainable forum for these discussions is key to assuring the public and the users of this technology that it will be done in a responsible way that benefits everyone.”
Increasingly, conversations about AI are happening outside of the Computer Science Department in spaces like the Institute of Politics, which hosted a talk last week called “Artificial Intelligence and Bias.” At the event, three professors from a variety of disciplines spoke about AI, its potential, and its risks.
“I fall into the category of people who are actually quite optimistic about the potential of the machine to help us overcome some of these human biases,” says Iris Bohnet, a speaker at the IOP event and director of the Women and Public Policy Program at the Harvard Kennedy School.
Bohnet, like Gasser, is one of an increasing number of social scientists who research the impact of technology on society. She has spent much of her career researching human bias in the workplace, and says she thinks sophisticated technology can do even more to promote equality.
“There is a real and urgent need to create interfaces where dialogues can occur between engineers, computer scientists, and developers on one side,” says Gasser, “and social scientists, lawyers, policy experts, and the humanities on the other side.”

Tucked into a nook of Harvard Square, Good Vibrations lies below the sidewalk and down a set of quaint little stairs.
Flanked by delicate flower pots and a dainty curved handrail, the entrance to the bright and spacious store is conspicuously welcoming.
Good Vibrations is a “pleasure boutique” founded in 1977 with the goal of creating a “clean, well-lighted alternative to conventional adult bookstores,” according to its website. The business originated in San Francisco and made its East Coast debut in 2006 in Brookline, Mass. Last month, Good Vibrations opened its ninth store in Harvard Square.
“We’re a place where anyone, regardless of gender or sexuality, can feel comfortable coming in, asking questions, and getting an education alongside a really quality product,” says Allyssa S. Prutzman, a Sex Educator-Sales Associate—SEAS—at Good Vibrations. “Pleasure is your birthright, and you deserve to feel it no matter what walk of life you’re coming from. And you deserve to feel it in a shame-free way,” she says.
As a SEAS, Prutzman went through 40 hours of orientation training in her first three months on the job. Good Vibrations is host to a staff sexologist, Carol Queen, to run training workshops for the team.
Prutzman, a self-described “Good Vibes evangelist,” emphasizes the importance of normalizing sexual health. “I think, for a lot of people, what comes to mind [regarding sexual awareness] is talking about sex positivity,” Prutzman says. “Sometimes people think that it just means, ‘Yay sex. Everyone should have all the sex.’ That’s great if that’s what people want, but sex positivity is so much more than that—it’s supporting people in wherever their journey takes them.”
A significant portion of Good Vibrations’ customers walk into the store unfamiliar with sex toys or products—a boon for Prutzman. “It’s been really cool to be in a space where we can tell people, ‘It’s okay if you choose not to have sex,’ or ‘It’s okay to be by yourself,’ or ‘It’s okay to bring toys with your partner into the bedroom.’ Whatever works for you—that’s what you should do. Not strive to meet some other standard.”
In line with promoting healthy attitudes about sex, Good Vibrations offers educational events and classes at its Brookline location. These classes include a hands-on rope bondage course, a sex toy demonstration workshop named “Harness Your Pleasure: Strap on Play for All!”, and a discussion session called “Vocalizing Desire: Turning Wants into Words.”
“I teach a polyamory class talking about open relationships and what that looks like for folks,” Prutzman says. “We do the whole gamut of classes. If there’s something that someone is looking for, it’s likely that we do it, and if not, we take requests.”
Good Vibrations also participates in Harvard’s Sex Week, hosting Good Vibes’ Sexual Health and Outreach Workshops throughout the week.
“I’ve had multiple moments where I’ve seen that light bulb go off in people’s mind,” Prutzman says. “Realizing that they’re not ‘broken’ or ‘wrong’... Realizing that everything they’re doing, as long as it’s consensual, is alright. That’s one of my favorite parts of working here.”

There’s something comforting about walking into your classroom and sitting in the same seat each day. It’s an easy routine to fall into—it’s simple. Natural. Safe.
When Durba Mitra comes to Harvard next semester, as the first full-time faculty member for the Committee on Degrees in Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality, she will challenge that routine. Mitra, who currently teaches at Fordham University, plans to conduct classes in nontraditional locales like Widener Library, the Peabody Museum, and the Schlesinger Library.
“I try to transform the traditional classroom space,” she says. “Whenever you sit with students outside of a traditional classroom setting, it troubles all the norms of walking into a classroom and occupying the same space and sitting in the same chair every day.”
WGS is currently staffed entirely by faculty with joint teaching commitments, making Mitra’s role unique. She was also named the Carol K. Pforzheimer Assistant Professor at the Radcliffe Institute, a fellowship awarded to a selective group of faculty during their first years at Harvard. Furthermore, Mitra was selected for the professorship over 461 other applicants.
In other words, Mitra is already challenging Harvard norms, and she hasn’t even left Fordham’s campus yet.
As an assistant professor of History at Fordham, Mitra studies sexuality and its relationship to the intellectual history of South Asia. She attributes her interest in the field to her mother, an “extraordinary” woman who immigrated to Fargo, North Dakota from Calcutta.
Mitra says her mother leads a “feminist life.” When Mitra’s mother arrived in the United States in the 1980s, she managed to earn a Ph.D. in Statistics while working a full-time job and raising two children, all on her own. Mitra attributes her “intellectual investment in gender studies” to her mother.
She remembers learning about South Asian gender and sexuality in another unconventional classroom: her childhood kitchen. “It’s in conversation with my mom, in a kitchen, over cooking, that these intellectual questions start to emerge,” Mitra remembers. “How do women organize their social worlds? What does it mean to be a woman?”
Robin M. Bernstein, the chair of the WGS Committee and a professor in the History Department, says she is excited to watch Mitra answer these questions in the years to come. Bernstein calls Mitra’s scholarship “outstanding” and her teaching style “dynamite.”
Louie D. Valencia García, a current Harvard History and Literature lecturer, says he first met Mitra at Fordham, where she acted as his unofficial mentor while he pursued postgraduate studies in European history. In the months that followed, Valencia García says he came to know Mitra as an “empowering” woman. “She is one of those people that make you wonder how she has time to do everything she does,” he says.
Mitra’s classes would often take trips off campus to places like Harlem. She has taught in locales ranging from the Bronx Zoo to the intersection of Fifth Ave and East 103rd Street.
Mitra’s arrival heralds small changes—the setting of a classroom—and bigger ones. According to Bernstein, the precedent Mitra sets as the first full-time WGS professor signifies a “new phase of increased commitment” by the University to the study of women and gender.
Lizabeth A. Cohen, Dean of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Studies and professor of American Studies at Harvard, agrees. She calls Mitra’s hiring a “very important step forward” for WGS.
Mitra knows first-hand the significance of steps such as these. “For anyone in my generation, we didn’t know that thinking about these questions could be a profession,” she says. “It’s a revelation for my mom; it’s a revelation for me.”

FAS OPEN THURSDAY, CLASSES AS SCHEDULED
Dear members of the FAS community,
The University and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS) have been monitoring the winter storm approaching the Cambridge/Boston area. At this time, FAS plans to remain open for normal operations on Thursday.
We will continue to provide updates detailing any developments, though note that any cancellations will be made over my cold, dead body.
Sincerely, Leslie A. Kirwan
FAS WINTER WEATHER UPDATE, THURSDAY 8 A.M.
Dear members of the FAS community,
FAS has been monitoring the ongoing winter storm and its deteriorating conditions. While the situation continues to develop, the University remains open at this moment. We ask that those members of our community who have already arrived on campus please proceed to their duties as scheduled.
Instructors should email students if they are for some reason unable to commute to campus. An updated list of affected courses can be found on Registrar Michael P. Burke’s Tumblr page.
Concerning the President’s recent comments on the disputed islands in the East China Sea: I want to remind you that with the increasing threat of total nuclear war, I take pleasure in knowing that your last day in civil society will be spent trudging through two-foot high snow banks.
Sincerely, Leslie Kirwan
FAS OPEN ON FRIDAY
Dear members of the FAS community,
We did it. Yes, we actually dropped a goddamn nuke. I write this with one bar on my Blackberry, from my makeshift office on the bottom floor of Widener. We have entered day one of nuclear fallout and circumstances are not ideal. As such, classes are hereby cancelled—kidding! That was a good one, if I do say so myself. FAS will remain open for normal operations. This is Harvard, after all!
I would like to address this evening’s MessageMe alert sent by somebody posing as Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, which read, “gET out WHLE you StILL CaN, thEre r zOMbiEs iN tHE YARd.” Rest assured, this message was sent in error. There are not, nor have there ever been, ghouls in the Yard. These moaning creatures are not irradiated mutants, merely freshmen unaccustomed to the New England winter. Please understand they have been without running water and electricity for almost two days now.
Courses may be cancelled at each instructor’s discretion. As Burke has been MIA for several hours and has stopped updating his Tumblr page, I have written out the affected courses with the tears of my critics on the outer facade of University Hall. Like that of cancelled classes, the list of my foes is ever-growing. Luckily, this means no shortage of tears.
Calm down, calm down! I’m just joking. In times like these, it’s important to have a sense of humor.
Please keep warm, as this brisk winter weather looks like it will continue for some time.
Sincerely, Leslie Kirwan
FAS OPEN, NOW AND FOREVER
Dear members of the FAS community,
You thought you had heard the last from me, huh?
Well I sure as hell wish I heard the last of YOU a long time ago. Another email from Leslie Kirwan, you said. Maybe she gets some sort of twisted high from refusing to cancel school when every other institution in the Greater Boston Area is closed, you said. Well, I want to let you all know that I heard it. I heard it all. And Leslie remembers everything.
By the way, to answer your snarky comments, it does feel good.
Even my assistants left today. They told me that I was a madwoman. “Dying of hunger,” they said. Pshh. Hunger? Those weak-willed fools know nothing. There’s tons of good food here. I may have started to eat moldy leather book bindings, but they are high in nutritious content. And what harm has a little cold ever done? I don’t need them anyway. I don’t need ANY of you.
So, with that, I take the utmost pleasure in announcing that FAS will remain open for normal operations today, and for all days to come.
I’m the only one here now. No staff. No faculty. No students. And you call yourselves affiliates of Harvard University?
This shit wouldn’t fly in New Haven.
Sincerely, Leslie Kirwan
P.S. I lied. Yes, fine, I admit it. There are zombies in the yard–angry, irradiated zombies. Many of them were once freshmen, I presume, so what I said before was not inaccurate. Though they speak in anguished moans, I can understand them now. I am their leader.

When it first happened, Lynn J. Ochberg ’64 was most worried about the bloodstain. She had borrowed the dress from a wealthy girl who lived across the hall—the daughter of a Greek shipping magnate, she recalled.
“It took me many, many minutes to wash it all out, and I had to dry it and iron it,” Ochberg said. “That’s what I was worried about, not myself.”
The year was 1960, it was orientation week for Ochberg’s freshman year at Radcliffe, and, she said, she had just been sexually assaulted by a senior on Harvard’s football team.  The bloodstain measured 20 inches across.
The story dates back 57 years, but I met its protagonist under distinctly 21st-century circumstances: My editor and I found Ochberg in the comments section of a New York Times op-ed authored by former Fifteen Minutes Magazine chair Maia R. Silber ’17.
The Times piece, published soon after The Crimson shed light on a sexually explicit “scouting report” produced by the 2012 men’s soccer team, dissected aspects of Harvard’s culture that “give misogyny a vocabulary” on campus. Ochberg’s take, flagged as a “Times Pick” and “recommended” by 275 readers on Facebook, swiftly climbed to the top of the comments section.
There’s nothing new in this report. I was a Harvard student in 1960 when the females were called Radcliffe students and a publication full of our high school photos was distributed to the male students with our contact info printed with each picture. Some of us, especially midwestern quota fillers like me, were so naive as to relish the sudden unprecedented popularity that ensued. [...] even a plain girl was tasty bait. Many of us were raped before the first week of orientation ended. We were advised by assigned ‘big sisters’ to keep quiet about it and consider it a ‘milestone’ achieved rather than as a sexual assault.
When today’s freshmen move into Harvard Yard for orientation, they become acquainted with roommates, campus culture, and the numerous resources available to them, including a veritable alphabet soup of outlets for discussing sex, relationships, and sexual assault. There’s the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, or OSAPR; the Office of Sexual and Gender-Based Dispute Resolution, called the ODR; Sexual Health and Relationship Counselors, commonly known as SHARC; and many others.
“If anything happens,” every proctor, Peer Advising Fellow, and administrator seems to say, “You can talk about it.”
But things haven’t always been this way. What University President Drew G. Faust once called a “troubling” climate of sexual assault has a long and complex history at Harvard, which has only been officially coeducational since 1999.
The first women to study at Harvard were part of the “Harvard Annex,” a private program founded in 1879. Radcliffe, a women’s college, received its charter in 1894. Greatly outnumbered by their male Harvard peers until the late 70’s when they were accepted in a coed admissions process, Radcliffe women grew to expect lewd remarks and unwelcome advances from professors, teaching fellows, and classmates.
Before the term “date rape” was coined in Susan Brownmiller’s 1975 book "Against Our Will," sexual assault was widely imagined as a crime committed by strangers—something that happened to “naive” women walking through Cambridge Common after a certain time of night.
During the 70’s in particular, new conceptions of sexual violence developed, and with these conceptions came new responsibilities for the University. Harvard’s own students and faculty members were victims and perpetrators of sexual harassment and assault, and the University was charged with creating procedures to respond.
Although many remain skeptical of the University’s ability to handle sexual assault, Harvard now loudly asserts its commitment to the issue through reports, trainings, talks, committees, task forces, and even historic sanctions on single-gender social organizations.
After reading Ochberg’s comment, my editor and I were determined to find more stories like hers: those of women who had fielded unwanted advances at Harvard long before the institution developed a vocabulary to talk about them.
After a search through Harvard’s alumni directory, I sent Ochberg a message asking for an interview. Within a few hours, she had responded with a detailed account of the assault.
There was a mixer at a men’s dorm in the Yard. Ochberg left the party with a football player, a senior, she said, and went to a bar across the street. He had a beer. She declined and said she wanted to return to her dorm in the Radcliffe Quad, where all female students lived at the time. The football player drove up Garden Street, stopped the car a couple hundred feet away from the entrance of Briggs Hall (now part of Cabot House), lowered the back of the passenger seat, and sexually assaulted her.    
Ochberg’s assigned “big sister,” a Radcliffe sophomore who also lived in Briggs Hall, cautioned her against taking action. Reporting the assault, the sophomore said, would “ruin the career” of the law-school-bound football player and bring about more trauma than resolution.
Ochberg recalled that there were no formal, on-campus venues for reporting her sexual assault—she would have had to go to the police.
In her e-mail, Ochberg described the incident as “astonishing and unwelcome” but chalked it up to “simple naivete.” She was 17, a Midwesterner away from home for the first time. She resolved to “think of it as little as possible.”
A week after the assault, Ochberg met a Harvard man and confided in him about the experience. He was a senior, a History and Literature concentrator, and rather romantically-minded. He wrote a poem about Ochberg comparing her to a “tattered flag.”
“A tattered flag! Can you imagine?” Ochberg asked, laughing. We were talking on the phone on her 74th birthday. “I didn’t think of myself as tattered—I thought of myself as educated.”
The young poet later became a trauma psychiatrist and her husband.
I expected Ochberg to be as outraged by the assault as I was. Instead, she repeatedly described herself as “educated” and “initiated” by the experience—high school sex ed had been limited in the 50’s. A classmate from Iowa, she recalled, was only knowledgeable about sex because she had grown up watching animals copulate on a farm. Ochberg talked at length about the bloodstain, about scrubbing the borrowed dress in the bathroom sink. Still, she insisted, the assault “never bothered her much.”
She estimated that about a third of her close friends were likely “initiated in the same fashion.” Ochberg, then, was one of many who could speak to the climate at Radcliffe.
I wrote to dozens of alumni class secretaries who graduated from Radcliffe or Harvard in the 60’s, 70’s, and early 80’s. They posted notices on class email lists on my behalf, explaining the story and requesting that women who wanted to talk about sexual harassment and assault contact me. Slowly but steadily, the responses came in.
I began my research with alumni who graduated in the 60’s, and patterns emerged in my interviews. A few phrases, memories, and sentiments appeared repeatedly.
On sex: Before the advent of coed housing in 1971, “parietal hours” designated times at which students could have a guest of the opposite sex in their rooms, although three of four feet had to remain on the ground for the duration of the visit. Women were limited to 25 visiting hours per week.
On sexual assault: One had to be careful when walking back to the Radcliffe dorms late at night.
On sexual assault committed by undergraduate peers: It must have happened, but no one was talking about it.
On campus resources for handling sexual assault: If they existed, few people knew about them.
And finally, there was the general and resigned, “That’s just the way it was back then.” This mantra echoed among alumni who had graduated long after the 60’s.
Margery M. Sabin ’60 never liked to close the window of her room. She lived on the fourth floor of Eliot Hall (now part of Cabot House). Her room had a fire escape, and a window grate that made the space “like a prison cell” when locked.
Sabin says she was working in her room alone—many of her friends had already left for the Thanksgiving holiday—when an intruder entered through the window and attacked her. With his hand covering her mouth, Sabin struggled. She ultimately fought him off. The intruder escaped the same way he had entered. 
The attempted assault was followed by a brief visit from the police and an angry letter from Sabin’s father to Radcliffe administrators, but little came of the case.
“I don’t know that my father got any response from any college authority,” she said.
When I asked Sabin if I might be able to locate the attack in police records, she said she’d be surprised if I could. She didn’t remember seeing the officers taking notes.
Ellen H. Hume ’68, who graduated nearly a decade after Sabin did, said law enforcement officers “did not take these problems seriously.” Hume says she witnessed a man masturbating in a car parked just meters away from Radcliffe dorms. She notified the police of what she had seen and was treated with “great skepticism.”
“I was questioned as if I had some weird interest in sex,” she said.
Before sexual harassment and assault were understood to be on-campus problems in the 70’s, they were long regarded as issues of public safety—justice would be served by police, not Harvard or Radcliffe administrators. However, law enforcement procedures for handling rape cases did not come under serious scrutiny until after Hume and Sabin graduated.
Former Radcliffe President Matina S. Horner, whose tenure lasted from 1972 to 1989, put herself on “rape call” for several months during the early years of her presidency.
“I decided it was important to see what students were subjected to if they reported a rape,” Horner said. “They were subjected to questions from the police that were way out of line.”
Despite shortcomings in the existing system, Horner remembered meeting with officers who had resolved to do better. She described her partnership with a “fabulous” Cambridge police chief who “agreed they needed to do training and sensitize [officers]” to better handle sexual assault cases.
Shane Snowdon ’78, whose undergraduate days were largely dedicated to feminist activism, did not recall the same enthusiasm from law enforcement. Snowdon said she and her peers, many of whom were active members of the Radcliffe Union of Students and staffed the Boston Area Rape Crisis Center, had to “dog” leaders in police forces about implementing sexual assault training for officers.
“They said, ‘We can’t spare anyone to go over,’” Snowdon said. “It was definitely like pulling teeth.”
Current Deputy Superintendent of the Cambridge Police Department Jack Albert said the force’s  most senior personnel, who started their careers in the early 80’s, “would have responded to such calls for service in a much different way.”
At Jubilee Weekend in 1965, Hume danced onstage with famed blues singer Bo Diddley. Because a number of Harvard men had taken note of her portrait in the class register—a directory with pictures and contact information for every Radcliffe student—Hume had been voted “Ms. Hope T. Seeia,” a title comparable to “homecoming queen” for freshman women.
Harvard football was playing against Dartmouth, which was still an all-male college, for Jubilee Weekend. A handful of Dartmouth men sent Hume a letter, which she ignored, petitioning her to come to the game dressed only in a slip.
“It was all very silly,” Hume said on the phone. “It wasn’t something I welcomed, just something funny that happened, and I went along with the joke.”
The distribution of the freshman register fed into a robust dating culture at Harvard-Radcliffe. In the 60’s, when undergraduate men still outnumbered women 4 to 1, Radcliffe students were “besieged with attention,” Hume said. 
Ochberg said she went on 90 dates during her freshman year and often overheard male students scheming “efforts to make [Radcliffe women] their prey.” She left Radcliffe after her freshman year because she found the culture “stultifying” and overly concerned with making its students into “gracious ladies.”
“Everything was done to facilitate the acquisition of husbands and wives,” Ochberg recalled.
Radcliffe students, too, received copies of the Harvard register, although they were rarely the ones calling for dates. Sometime in the 70’s, Harvard began printing freshman photographs in a single co-ed directory.
This change reflected the shifting relationship between the two colleges that characterized the decade—1971 saw the beginning of coed housing, 1975 the inception of a single, coed admissions process. While many women eagerly embraced the “Harvard” label, some feared the Radcliffe identity would disappear altogether.
Although the identity of the women’s college was in flux, unequal gender dynamics among students persisted. But the 70’s brought the crescendo of the Sexual Revolution, a strong current of feminist organizing across the United States, and Title IX—a federal statute prohibiting gender discrimination in federally-funded educational institutions.
Recent studies suggest that up to 70% of sexual assaults are committed by people known to the victim. Although no such statistics were known in the 70’s, there grew a budding understanding that unwanted sexual conduct was an in-house problem—one that fell in the purview of University administrators as well as police.
Slowly, there came a realization that sexual violence permeated dorms and classrooms as much it did Cambridge Common after dark. The 70’s brought methods of naming unwelcome sexual behaviors that had existed long before Harvard did.
As women increasingly moved into River Houses, the Women’s Center—founded by Radcliffe students in 1974—remained a stronghold of Radcliffe pride and feminist organizing. Student-run rape support groups were among the Center’s landmark programs. Snowdon said officials at University Hall and police forces were resistant to activists’ demands for resources relating to sexual assault, and that the issue was treated as a “woman’s individual problem.”     
“You could obviously go see someone at UHS counseling services, but there also wasn’t any sense that that was going to be more than your personal tragedy,” Snowdon said. “What we had to do was organize among ourselves—we began saying that we were interested in talking, sharing our experiences.”
In Women’s Center support groups, several Radcliffe students grappled with new understandings of sexual assault. At the time, feminist thinking was indelibly shaped by Brownmiller’s text and its exploration of the concept of date rape, which complicated the experiences of women at Radcliffe and beyond.
“I think these were the harder things to talk about, because it was a culture that blamed women tremendously for rape,” Snowdon said. “It was harder to talk outside our own circles about rape by someone with whom we were at a party or someone we knew.”
There was substantial overlap between the membership of the Women’s Center and that of the Radcliffe Union of Students and Seventh Sister, a student-produced feminist magazine. 
Snowdon was one of four authors of an article titled “Rape: A Tradition of Men in Positions of Power,” which was followed by a piece called “Will More Locks Help? How Students Can Stop Rape.” Betty A. Krier ’78, a co-author of both articles, said many women, including herself and others in visible feminist spaces on campus, still felt pressured to remain silent about their own experiences of sexual harassment.
“It was worse than we understood while we were there,” Krier said. In her social circle, many testimonies of “sexual harassment or worse” emerged long after graduation. “I was with a cohort of women who were trying to organize and give ourselves voices, but we didn’t tell each other what we had gone through.” 
Krier spoke from experience. Her sophomore tutor, a graduate student, said she was “doing so much better” than other students in the course. He asked her to start meeting one-on-one.
“It wasn’t before long that he started closing in on me, getting physically way too close to me, and I knew it wouldn’t end well,” Krier said. She stopped attending the meetings, and her grade suffered. “The level of sexual harassment sometimes made us change fields, drop courses.”
Claims of sexual harassment by teaching fellows, professors, and tutors appeared in nearly every interview I conducted with alumni. As I continued to interview women like Ochberg, Hume, and Krier, a rich history of unwelcome sexual behavior at Harvard emerged.
In 1972, Title IX was codified as an amendment to the Higher Education Act of 1965. Harvard hired Mia Karvonides, its first Title IX officer, nearly 40 years later.
The Title IX most college students know now—what I had always assumed to be a piece of sexual assault legislation—was understood quite differently at its inception in the early 70’s. For nearly the first three decades of its existence, Title IX was known as the law that guaranteed equal access to sports teams and facilities for men and women at schools funded by the federal government. Until the Office of Civil Rights issued a guidance in 2001, Title IX had little effect on sexual harassment and assault policy at schools.
As Title IX staked its claim on locker rooms, playing fields, and courts, Harvard’s internal structures for reporting and responding to sexual harassment and assault remained nebulous and decentralized during the early to mid-70’s.
Even the Radcliffe Institute, a precursor to the modern Women’s Center, lacked resources for rape counseling. The Institute was one of several examined in a national study of women’s centers on college campuses conducted by the Association of American Colleges in 1971.
In the “Activities” section of the AAC questionnaire, women’s center employees were to check boxes on a table to indicate their offerings, priorities, and planned programming. For the Radcliffe Institute’s form, the box for rape counseling, among others, was checked in the far right column—they had not offered and did not intend to offer the service.        
Harvard’s first sexual harassment policy, established by the Faculty, was implemented in 1978. Marlyn E. McGrath, now Director of Undergraduate Admissions, was then the Assistant Dean of Harvard College—and a “hearing officer” for sexual harassment cases. As a hearing officer, McGrath fielded, investigated, and mediated students’ complaints about sexual harassment, along with a network of other administrators.
But some of the loudest voices in the burgeoning conversation about sexual harassment came from beyond the walls of University Hall.
McGrath still remembers the names of some vocal activists from the Radcliffe Union of Students. Elisabeth M. Einaudi ’83, then president of RUS, was a prominent campus figure, quoted in countless Crimson articles about sexual violence and seemingly every feminist cause under the sun.    
Incited by a series of high-profile allegations against Harvard professors, Einaudi and another RUS organizer, Victoria Eastus ’83, spearheaded a student push for reform in sexual harassment reporting procedures.
In October 1982, Einaudi and Eastus penned a letter to then-Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Henry Rosovsky, sharply criticizing the Faculty’s lack of a “formal statement of policy against sexual harassment.” Although there existed a “formal grievance procedure to redress specific incidents,” the two students urged the Faculty to “release a clear policy stating the University’s position.”
Outside experts on sexual harassment in the Cambridge area handled about 28 cases from Harvard in 1981, according to Einaudi and Eastus at the time. In each of the cases, the complainant “was either reluctant to approach Harvard administrators or was ignorant of the procedures.”
During their junior and senior years at the College, the duo appeared at meetings, wrote up pamphlets and drafted potential policies for Faculty members after the Dean’s office “challenged” them to do so, Eastus said. They received funding and invited Catherine MacKinnon, a radical feminist scholar who positioned sexual harassment as a civil rights issue, to speak on campus.
Eastus recalled a rather awkward dinner she attended with Einaudi, MacKinnon, and then-Dean of Harvard College John B. Fox Jr. ’59.  The four of them were seated around a low table at a traditional Japanese restaurant, cross-legged on the ground. MacKinnon turned to Fox and explained the definitions of sexual harassment that were “burbling through the courts.” Fox, who was “well over six feet tall,” struggled to tuck his “hugely long legs” under the table and looked “horribly uncomfortable.”
In an e-mail to The Crimson, Fox said he did not recall the dinner nor did he remember meeting Einaudi or Eastus.
The discourse about sexual harassment that began to rattle faculty meetings in 1978 came to a head in February 1983 with the release of a “Dear Colleague” letter, written by Rosovsky and a handful of administrators and professors. The letter was sent to the entire faculty.
“A group of administrators and faculty worked to develop a text in the hope it would be helpful to articulate the faculty’s expectations about their behavior toward those for whom they were responsible,” McGrath said. The authors of the letter were particularly concerned about those in “asymmetrical relationships, relationships in which one partner had academic or professional responsibility toward the other partner.”
The letter presented the Faculty’s definition of sexual harassment: “inappropriate personal attention by an instructor or other officer who is in a position to determine a student’s grade or otherwise affect the student’s academic performance or professional future.” The policy primarily concerned itself with sexual behaviors in unequal power dynamics and included no stipulations for sexual harassment among student peers.
The letter also established three pathways by which students could choose to pursue sexual harassment complaints. The first was informal resolution: an administrator would facilitate apologies or “changes in instructional arrangements” for the student. The second was a confidential, formal process by which a student could seek disciplinary action by the Dean of the Faculty against the instructor. Lastly, complaints of “grave misconduct” would be evaluated by “Screening and Hearing” panels. The letter said “grave misconduct” charges would be considered grounds for termination of employment or denial of tenure.
McGrath said the document’s authors struggled with language, as the letter needed to address a wide spectrum of behavior, including relationships that were inappropriate but not explicitly sexual. They settled on the word “amorous” to characterize both the “actions and feelings” that were to be kept out of faculty-student dynamics.
Although the 1983 letter asserted that relationships between faculty and students were “always fundamentally asymmetric in nature,” Harvard did not explicitly ban romantic and sexual relationships between professors and students until 2015. Before then, such relationships were merely labeled inappropriate.
Former President of Radcliffe College Matina Horner had a cough, and a rather terrible one at that—our interview was barely audible, thanks to her fits of violent coughing.
Fortunately, current Dean of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University Lizabeth Cohen granted me access to Horner’s records. Typically, administrative records are locked in the University Archives until 50 years after their creation. Records of individual employees and students remain locked for 80 years.
Inside Horner’s box: some mundane correspondences, a few internal policy studies, and an inch-thick folder labeled “Sexual Harassment.”
One document was more than 100 pages in length, a file titled “Unwanted Attention: A Report on a Sexual Harassment Survey,” authored by then-Dean of Undergraduate Education Sidney Verba in September 1983.
The survey was University-wide, distributed by mail to all faculty members, 1000 graduate students (500 male, 500 female), and 2000 undergraduates (1000 male, 1000 female). The response rate was 70 per cent. The report summarized experiences of sexual harassment across many demographics at Harvard, revealing that unwanted sexual behavior disproportionately claimed women as its victims.
While incidents of “actual or attempted assault” were scarce, female respondents testified to widespread experiences of sexual “teasing and jokes,” as well as sexual “looks and gestures” from academic superiors. Few undergraduate and graduate women reported pressure for sexual favors from authority figures, but 12 percent of senior faculty women and 10 percent of junior faculty women said their superiors had pushed them toward such arrangements.
Following the report is a 35-page appendix documenting complaints of sexual harassment written by anonymous female survey respondents, from undergraduate women to senior faculty women. The incidents included salacious comments, threatening phone calls, and unwanted but persistent physical advances.
From an undergraduate woman’s account of office hours with a graduate teaching fellow:
While eyeballing my bosom he put his hand on his knee and proceeded to rub. [...] I said “I have to go now.” He spoke of being lonely and looked suggestively at his lap and then at me.
From an undergraduate woman’s comment on her relationship with her advisor:
When I was saying good-bye to leave Cambridge for the summer, he cornered me, kissed me, and said, “I think I deserved that.”
For most cases, the reported “resolution” to the harassment was avoidance: missing class, switching departments, abandoning projects, and remaining silent during meetings for fear of drawing attention. Fearing the wandering gazes, suggestive words, and unwelcome touches of their superiors, women moved themselves to places where they felt safer.
The document also exposed a massive, gendered fissure in perceptions of sexual harassment at Harvard. The authors of the report were attentive to the “asymmetrical” nature of relationships between instructors and students articulated in the “Dear Colleague” letter, and reported that men were more likely to consider sexual harassment “a problem of sexuality” while women were likely to see it as “an issue of power.”
There was a general consensus that sexual harassment was bad—but was it Harvard’s problem? Two main questions brought substantial disagreement to the fore. First, which behaviors fall into the category of sexual harassment? Second, to what degree can and should Harvard regulate those behaviors?
Half of male faculty and a third of male graduate students said they thought sexual harassment was not a problem at Harvard. Those numbers were significantly lower among women.
Nine out of 10 respondents in all groups saw unwelcome pressure for dates as sexual harassment. Three out of four male faculty respondents, however, did not consider the behavior “a matter for University concern.”
Although some outliers left comments praising the survey and others responded with dull apathy, men—particularly faculty men—widely dismissed the problem altogether, calling the study a waste of time.
One tenured male professor sarcastically claimed he felt victimized by the survey:
This is a monumental waste of money! I’d call it staff harassment!
Many characterized sexual behaviors in the classroom as somehow inevitable. The University, they argued, had no business trying to regulate expressions of natural human impulse.
Relations between faculty and student must be attrative [sic] and (possibly) sexual. One can’t learn OR teach unless there exists some vital, perhaps physical, concern with mind and/or person of the instructor and student. OTHERWISE, is the teacher a computer?
Others protested administrative action on principle.
Generally the university should treat people like adults by allowing them to solve their own problems whenever possible. Only in cases of outright sexual blackmail by persons in authority should the university step in. Otherwise the whole thing could be magnified way out of proportion.
Several commenters expressed concerns about broadening definitions of sexual harassment.
It is important to investigate very thoroughly those who make charges of sexual harassment as well, since such accusations could be used as a tool of reprisal against, say, a professor who has ignored some overtures on the part of a student or who has given the student a poor grade.
Beneath the indignant dismissals and vitriolic denials, there lurked a pervasive suspicion that Harvard women were simply crying wolf.
The university should in any case maintain a low profile on the subject. Much of the harassment bit is due to feminist hysteria. [...] The university should be as alert to abuse of harassment charges as to actual harassment.
In my experience, from my vantage point, the issues here are fabricated.
Shortly after this report was released to the faculty, then-Radcliffe President Horner was quoted in Seventh Sister saying that students in low-cut blouses were “asking for it.”
The boys from downstairs thought Clea Simon ’83 could use some cheering up. She had just fought with her boyfriend—loudly enough that they could hear it. She had been crying. It was September, maybe October of her freshman year. They knocked on her door, she said, bearing a pitcher of Bullfrog mixed drink.
“In retrospect, I don’t know if there was anything else in that,” Simon said. The drink might have been spiked with something more than just vodka. She was dehydrated from crying and her tolerance was low. “I woke up, I was naked, and one of them was having sex with me.”
Weeks after the incident, Simon found out she was pregnant. She went to University Health Services for an abortion. She never reported the assault to the police or Harvard authorities.
Contemporary discourse about sexual violence on college campuses focuses largely on peer-on-peer assault—horror stories set against boozy backdrops of frat-house revelry. But in 1979, during Simon’s freshman year, the concepts of date rape and acquaintance rape were still just beginning to emerge in the national consciousness.
“It took many years before I called it rape,” Simon said. “I called it ‘being stupid,’ and I felt culpable.”
An alum who graduated in 1984 who requested anonymity said College administrators handled her attempted assault “as well as they could have,” although she did not report the incident herself.
She says she found herself unexpectedly drunk after having one beer and was attacked by a friend—he had concealed prescription drugs in her drink with the intention of assaulting her. The perpetrator’s roommate returned unexpectedly early from Lamont, interrupted the act of sexual battery, and reported the incident to her resident tutors. Like Simon, she struggled to come to terms with the attack, which was perpetrated by someone she knew well.
“I could not be persuaded that I was drugged,” she said. “I was convinced he was my friend who had gotten mixed signals.”
The perpetrator was expelled from Harvard. When I asked if she would have pressed charges against the man she thought to be a friend, she said, “You’re positing hypotheticals that wouldn’t have made sense back then.”
As contentious debates about harassment and professional conduct pushed forward in stately administrative buildings, sexual assault between undergraduate peers remained a problem, albeit a less clearly-defined one. Although prominent feminist thinkers and activists pushed the idea that sexual harassment was a civil rights violation, women were still widely expected to be responsible for keeping themselves safe from rape.
“The environment was such that we were just assumed to be the guardians of our own bodies,” Simon said.
Echoing Simon, Einaudi said many women at Harvard didn’t expect the University to interfere in their relationships with other undergraduates.
McGrath, who has served on the Administrative Board since 1978, said she remembers the disciplinary body started hearing cases described as “date rape” in the late 70’s and early 80’s, although there had always been cases of “men and women behaving badly toward one another.”
Simon arrived at Harvard at a moment in which professors were beginning to be held accountable for lewd looks and classroom catcalls. But conversations about sexual assault between peers—about “men and women behaving badly”—were still just starting to take shape.
It would take decades before Harvard’s process for handling such cases would come to resemble what it does today.
In 1990, the College assembled a Date Rape Task Force.
In 1993, a policy statement on sexual misconduct appeared in student handbooks for Harvard undergraduates for the first time.
In 2001, the Office of Civil Rights released a guidance that revolutionized Title IX, designating sexual harassment as a form of gender discrimination.
In 2003, the Leaning Committee, established to consider sexual assault education and support for victims, created the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response at Harvard.
In 2013, Harvard hired its first Title IX officer.
The 90’s and early 2000’s alone brought a wave of policies, at federal and university levels, that refashioned nationwide understandings of sexual assault. Paging through more recent documents and looking back on my reporting, I find myself tempted to echo some variation of what many of my interview subjects had said: “Things were so different back then.”
In September 2015, Faust faced a packed room and soberly announced the “troubling” results of a University-wide sexual assault survey. Nearly a third of undergraduate women who responded had experienced some sort of sexual assault since starting college. The University’s response to sexual assault, Faust declared, was “totally insufficient.”
Administrators had spent months developing the survey, and even compensated each respondent with $5 to spend on Amazon. The study described the painful details of sexual misconduct, specifying actions like “penetration” or “sexual touching.”  It even pinpointed the most commonly-cited locations for sexual assaults. More than 75 percent of assaults took place in dorm rooms. The second-most cited venue: final clubs.
When the lewd comments from the 2012 soccer team’s “scouting report” were revealed, students were perturbed but unsurprised. Just as Ochberg became accustomed to overhearing schemes to make “prey” of Radcliffe women as Harvard men pored over the freshman register, Harvard students experienced brief outrage over the “scouting report” that was quickly eclipsed by familiar, bored, disturbance.
The uptick of institutional responsibility for sexual assault is something of a paradox. Since Ochberg, Hume, Krier, and Simon graduated, Harvard—and educational institutions across the country—have developed language and avenues for discussing sexual assault. Yet the structures and cultural norms built in the name of progress often only expose the ways things haven’t changed.
To someone tracking the conversation, it might seem like sexual assault is a new issue. Going through old files, records of campus sexual violence (often logged under terms like “security” and “harassment”) only begin in the ‘70s, amping up through subsequent decades.
Today, we have surveys, and officers, and splashy news features. Almost exactly a year ago, Fifteen Minutes Magazine ran a cover story about sexual assault—a catalogue of the contemporary climate. By the time this story goes to print, The Crimson will have run a news feature on the University’s Sexual Assault Prevention Task Force. Our vocabulary for making sense of the issue grows every year. This feels like an escalating narrative.
But where does that narrative start? The timeframe of this story begins in 1960 because that’s when Ochberg started her freshman year—but women had already been on campus, sitting through lectures by Harvard professors, for 81 years before she arrived.
For decades, the testimonies of hundreds of anonymous women—of lingering looks, prurient remarks, and persistent touches—sat in a restricted folder of Horner’s old files. Ochberg and Simon’s assaults, however, have no such record. The paper trail only goes back as far as an institution is willing to remember.
The history goes a little further.

Some BGLTQ senior citizens in Cambridge and Boston are lonely.
Ray Santos, an administrator for Ethos, a local not-for-profit organization intended to help senior citizens, says many BGLTQ older adults in the area lack a support system, without spouses, children, or relatives nearby. “LGBT elders are among the most vulnerable of older adults in society,” he says.
Over the past decade, Massachusetts elder care services have sought to address this loneliness through programming designed specifically for BGLTQ older adults. In particular, three organizations—Ethos, Fenway Health, and Somerville-Cambridge Elder Services—have stepped up to the task.
Lisa Krinsky, the director of Fenway Health’s LGBT Aging Project, says BGLTQ older adults were previously without resources tailored to their specific needs. “Massachusetts does a great job of taking care of older adults, but LGBT folks were nowhere on the radar. We kept thinking: How can we begin to build some bridges to engage them?” Krinsky says.
In 2004, Café Emmanuel was founded to serve as a community café for gay older men. On Feb. 8th, 2017, Café Pride opened its doors, aiming to serve BGLTQ elders of color. The cafes are typically run by a member of the BGLTQ community, and usually have a meal followed by a speaker or performance.
For some, these cafes provide an opportunity to socialize with old friends. For others, they are important resources for making new friends and finding new peers to whom they can relate.
“It’s a really important space for [LGBT senior citizens] to have. It’s kind of a community of their own that they develop friendships and relationships with,” says Melissa Bryant, an Elder Care Advisor and LGBT Liaison at Somerville-Cambridge Elder Services.
In addition to the meals and community cafes, many elder service providers are focusing on implementing more intergenerational events.
Last year, Somerville-Cambridge Eldercare Services hosted an event in conjunction with Harvard College Bisexual, Gay, Lesbian, Transgender, Queer, and Allied Students in the Sciences (HBASIS). Together, attendees explored the Harvard Museum of Natural History.
“The older adults really want to connect with younger people to hear what it's like now to be LGBT, to come out now that things like marriage are legalized,” Bryant explains. “It was a powerful event to see those connections.”
Krinsky, too, emphasizes the importance of intergenerational programming. “One of the things that we have always thought was important is that we have the faces and voices of older people at Pride in June,” she says. Several Cambridge groups have been working to coordinate trolleys for BGLTQ people to ride during the parade. “It’s really important that younger people see the people on whose shoulders they stand.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Medical School’s Diversity Task Force will meet six times over the next few months to formulate recommendations for Medical School Dean George Q. Daley ’82 about how to make the school more inclusive.
The task force will begin its work amid broad discussion of diversity at the school. Last year, a group of Medical School students calling itself the Racial Justice Coalition submitted a petition calling on University President Drew G. Faust to prioritize diversity during the search for the next dean of the school, among other demands.
After becoming dean in January, Daley announced the creation of the task force in an effort to seek a “stronger and deeper evaluation of the issues we are confronting.” Daley charged Dean of Diversity Joan Y. Reede with assembling the task force, which met for the first time Feb. 17.
After multiple discussions with members of the community, Reede brought together dozens of Medical School-affiliated students, faculty, researchers, and custodial and security staff with the goal of representing a wide swath of the school.
“I think as the meeting opened, I think that people got a real sense that the individuals on the task force are there partly representing the group in their multiple identities… but also because of their own personal journeys,” Reede said.
Timothy M. McGinnis, a Medical School student who is a member of the task force, participated in the First Year Urban Neighborhood Campaign orientation program and joined the Racial Justice Coalition before becoming involved in the task force. He said that he was “heartened” with the task force's creation.
“I view it as a way to serve immediately in the community where I find myself, and attempt to hold an institution to its ideals if possible,” McGinnis said.
In an interview, Reede outlined the four-step charge for the task force. The first part of the task force’s work, Reede said, is creating a “vision statement” for the Medical School that “is consistent with the school’s mission with diversity.”
The second objective of the task force is measuring the school’s progress towards becoming more diverse, according to Reede. The task force will create metrics, Reede said, to “hold ourselves accountable for achieving goals of diversity and inclusion.”
Reede said that the third step, which she called “a deeper dive into the community,” will include a closer examination of diversity initiatives across the Medical School and its affiliated facilities with the hopes of finding areas for improvement. Lastly, Reede said, the task force will create recommendations based on the overview and create “achievable” policy changes.
McGinnis said he found the wide scope of the task force “stirring.”
“It truly does seem like we will be able to solicit and listen to viewpoints that many of us wouldn’t have even thought to include in the first place,” McGinnis said.
The task force is not the only diversity-related program at the Medical School, but rather a “convergence” of many efforts and an opportunity to reflect on already existing ones, Reede said.
“There has been a lot of initiative from not just our students, but our faculty and trainees and others who are concerned with issues that range from diversity to immigration to health disparities,” Reede said. “People have been involved in these spaces for a while.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A College subcommittee considering whether to eliminate the current blocking process for upperclassmen housing assignment will share recommendations with Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana as soon as April.
The residential subcommittee is exploring several possible alternatives to Harvard’s current Housing system, which randomly places self-selected blocking groups of rising sophomores into the 12 Houses. The committee’s leading proposal would instead randomly assign each freshman entryway to one of the 12 Houses in a model almost identical to Yale's.
Under the proposal, freshmen would live in the same House as other members of their entryway—30 or so first-year Harvard students who share areas of the same dorm. If a student wants to opt out of their entryway’s House assignment, they would have the option to join a random lottery, according to Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67, who leads the residential subcommittee.
“You wouldn’t really be blocking as you know it now,” Dingman said. “You’d have a chance—because there are other entryways from across the Yard also assigned to that House—to pick people to room with from your current entryway or the other ones.”
The subcommittee is a segment of a broader College committee studying “inclusion and belonging.” Khurana tapped Jack C. Megan, director of Harvard’s Office for the Arts, to help lead the committee, which is studying how to better incorporate undergraduates from a variety of backgrounds into the College. A separate University-wide task force is also working to study diversity on campus.
Dingman said revising the housing assignment system could help welcome freshmen students into upperclassmen Houses and “re-center social life” in on-campus residences.
“With all the issues around the single-gender social organizations, there’s been an effort to try to bring back some of the entertainment and bonding experiences into the Houses,” Dingman said.
Dingman added that the current system is imperfect.
“We have heard from the Houses that sophomores often times feel a whole new beginning,” he said. “When they form blocking groups that are somewhat homogeneous, they don’t feel much inclination to reach out and get to know their new surroundings and the people in their class in the House.”
The subcommittee has solicited feedback on the preliminary proposal from undergraduate Peer Advising Fellows, who had “mixed” reactions, according to Brooks B. Lambert-Sluder ’05, assistant director of College advising programs.
Dingman said House Faculty Deans, resident deans, and members of the Undergraduate Council have also weighed in on the proposal.
Megan said that any change to the Housing model would be more complicated. He said any change would involve a “multi-year process.”
“The short term goal for all of us is to give some directional ideas to the Dean and then see which of these we want to explore,” Megan said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Kennedy School visiting scholar Christopher B. Barrett argued that “poverty traps”—systems by which it is difficult to escape poverty—often contribute to environmental degradation at an event Wednesday.
At the event, Barrett said poverty often places individuals in situations where physical mobility is difficult and can lead to environmental exhaustion. He pointed to poor pastoral families in East Africa that cannot afford to migrate to more resource-plentiful farms, and often damage and overgraze their soil.
“Once I’m poor, I behave in a poor way that keeps me poor and the environment around me induces behaviors that lead me to stay in this undesirable situation,” Barrett said. “In many cases, I will also degrade natural resource-base, whether by failing to invest in soil and water conservation, or by poaching wildlife in the area because my family is hungry.”
Barrett also noted that climate change plays a large role in worsening both environmental damage and the poverty trap, adding that climate change will create more frequent issues for poor populations.
“If droughts are increasing in frequency, people are going to suffer much more frequently. Their herds are going to be hit more often, they don’t have time to recover their herds,” he said.
Barrett said that one solution to breaking links between poverty and environmental damage involves providing insurance to the poor.
“Herders can get a pay out in the event drought hits their area and they expect to lose a lot of animals,” he said. “We’re actually seeing more insurers coming into this market.”
Elizabeth M. Wolkovich, an assistant professor in Organismic and Evolutionary Biology who organized the event, said she was excited to invite Barrett because she found it important to discuss various ways humans will suffer as climate change becomes more extreme.
“We can’t say or think about biodiversity or conservation without talking about the people and the wellbeing of humans,” Wolkovich said.
In an interview after the event, Barrett said his research exploring linkages between poverty and the environment is motivated by his interest in global social justice.
“I was interested in why so many people were so poor and stayed that way, and what can any one of us do to help them make their way out of poverty.”
The event, called “Poverty Traps, Resilience and Coupled Human-Natural Systems,” is a part of a seminar series launched last spring by the Harvard Center for the Environment, which focuses on ecological change and human-caused climate change.

This is Part I of a two-part series on Harvard's sexual assault prevention efforts. Part II, focusing on prevention efforts at the College, will run Feb. 27. 
An annotated version of the sexual assault report, meant to accompany this article, can be found here.
Last March, when a task force studying sexual assault prevention at Harvard released its final report after two years of meetings, it did not mince words.
Using data gathered in a campus-wide sexual conduct survey that showed what University President Drew G. Faust called a “troubling” incidence of sexual assault, the task force issued extensive recommendations for improving Harvard’s prevention efforts. In particular, the task force called for the creation of a new administrative position dedicated to prevention efforts, mandatory annual training for all students, and additional resources for BGLTQ students.
The effort, the task force implored, would be University-wide.
“It is only through the joint engagement of all parts of our campus that Harvard will make durable and significant progress in addressing the serious and longstanding problem of sexual assault,” their report reads.
But nearly a year after the task force issued its recommendations, many remain unfulfilled—and in some cases, entirely ignored. Several schools have no plans to require training across class years or provide additional resources for BGLTQ students, who suffer disproportionately high rates of sexual assault, for example. And the University has not created a new position in the Office of the Provost as the report urged.
Parts of the University have mobilized to fulfill some of the task force’s recommendations. Faust and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana unveiled a controversial policy penalizing College students involved in single-gender social organizations—a policy a new faculty-led committee will soon reconsider.
The University-wide Title IX office and the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response continued to expand their staffs and reach. And each of Harvard’s 13 schools submitted implementation plans to Faust before the start of this academic year outlining steps they would undertake in the coming year.
Still, despite some strides, Harvard’s efforts to combat sexual assault have not progressed through the “joint engagement” the task force envisioned. Faced with widely disparate student populations at Harvard’s 13 schools and without forceful oversight from the central administration, Harvard’s ability to implement the recommendations across the University remains tempered. At an institution with a long history of decentralization, swift and coordinated action does not come easily, even on what Faust called “the serious problem of sexual assault.”
'A Vital Role'
Since the 19th century, Harvard has followed a governing approach then-President John T. Kirkland called “every tub on its own bottom”—a decentralized model that delegates power to each individual school.
But in recent years, the University has sought to centralize and rebrand itself as “One Harvard,” and addressing sexual assault was one of the first issues to test this approach. Harvard hired Mia Karvonides as its first central Title IX officer in 2013, and unveiled a University-wide Title IX policy in 2014.
In its report, the task force argued sexual assault is a problem across Harvard’s schools, necessitating a centralized effort to successfully fight it. An entire section of the report makes the case for a new position in the Office of the Provost focused exclusively on sexual assault prevention.
The task force saw this as one of its more pressing recommendations, former Provost Steven E. Hyman, who chaired the task force said in an interview in January.
“The notion of having an individual responsible was something we felt was both feasible and important, precisely because the university is large and complex, sexual assault is multifarious in the way it occurs at the different schools...and that unless there was somebody paying attention, there was a risk that the efforts would become diffused, that months or years down the road some component of the University might lose energy or a sense of urgency,” Hyman said. “We thought that it was very very important that somebody be in a position to be aware and keep the community galvanized.”
In her March email to Harvard affiliates announcing the task force report, Faust wrote, “the position recommended by the task force will serve a vital role.”
Still, despite these strong urgings, the Provost’s office still has not created such a position and has no plans to do so 11 months after the report’s release. Instead, Deputy Provost Peggy Newell says she has taken on the duties that would fall to such an administrator, in addition to her typical workload. OSAPR and the Title IX Office were undergoing significant expansion at the time the task force report came out, and Newell said she was wary of redundancies.
“We were trying to figure out who’s already doing some of the things the task force is hoping that we’re going to do, and then we needed to figure out how to make the other things happen on an ongoing basis,” she said in an interview. “They were exactly correct that somebody needs to pay attention to this and somebody needs to make sure these things happen, because when everybody’s responsible, nobody’s responsible, and you do need to have somebody making sure it’s actually happening.”
While Newell has worked closely with various administrators, coordinating the web of related offices across the University remains challenging. The Title IX Office and the 55 Title IX coordinators across the individual schools work on prevention efforts, though Timothy J. Whelsky, an Associate Dean and Title IX coordinator at the Divinity School, said the coordinators have had “not much” direct contact with Newell. Their channel to the central administrators is through monthly meetings with the University’s Title IX Officer—now William D. McCants, who replaced Karvonides after her departure in January.
Representative from the Office of Sexual Assault of Prevention and Response often attend these meetings, OSAPR director Alicia Oeser said. Karvonides and Oeser also met monthly, a tradition McCants said he will continue.
But gathering all of these administrators in one room has not happened yet, according to Newell.
In its report, the task force suggested that the Provost’s Office create a working group to convene administrators “to share and discuss educational programming and initiatives.”
“Currently, administrators trying to create and promote educational tools are not always aware either of the work that has been done elsewhere or of which tools have proved to be most effective,” the task force wrote.
The Provost’s Office has not established such a working group. “I’ve met individually with most of the people who would be on such a working group, but we haven’t yet brought them together, other than through the Title IX coordinators,” Newell said. “We probably will create such a group, we just haven’t done it yet because I think it’s important when you launch a group like that, you want to launch it in a way that gives it the greatest chance of being successful and having the best possible impact.”
With this degree of separation between the Provost’s Office and the schools, central administrators are sometimes not aware of initiatives at certain schools. The task force’s report devotes seven of its 20 pages to improving prevention efforts at College, but Newell said she did not know about specific plans of action College working groups have already developed. She also said she did not know who was tasked with overseeing implementation of recommendations relating to the Houses.
Faust described the Provost’s administrative structure as “an evolving question.” But Newell said the Provost’s office has no intention of appointing such an administrator, at least for now.
“For the time being, it’s going to continue to be my responsibility,” Newell said. “At some point in the future, if we determine we’ve done this analysis and we’ve talked to all the schools, if we determine we needed somebody else to do this we could certainly do that. But as long as what the task force wanted to get done is getting done, and as long as all of our other initiatives are moving forward, and we’re doing what needs to be done, that may not be the best use of a position.”
'Differentially Speedy'
The degree and speed with which schools have moved forward has varied widely.
The Law School revamped its orientation program to incorporate small-group trainings, nine schools launched specialized versions of an informational app called Thrive@Harvard, the Divinity School expanded its Peer Advocates program, and the Graduate School of Education added sexual assault prevention workshops for educators throughout the year, among other measures.
Some schools, though, have not adopted many of the task force’s recommendations, particularly those calling for additional resources and administrative support for BGLTQ students.
While many Title IX coordinators and spokespeople across Harvard’s graduate and professional schools pointed to the activity BGLTQ student groups on their campuses, only the College and Medical School have hired specific BGLTQ administrators. Dental school students can access the Medical School resources, and the Graduate School of Education has a student intern dedicated to BGLTQ affairs. Other schools, such as the Kennedy School and the School of Public Health, have provided no additional sexual assault prevention resources to BGLTQ students.
In keeping with their relatively hands-off approach thus far, central administrators have not set deadlines for enacting sexual assault prevention measures.
“The task force had these recommendations about you should have these modules, and they recommended that they be mandatory,” McCants said. “That being the case, though, we want to defer to those who provide the learning and the discovery as to how best to implement that. So it wouldn’t be a ‘this all must happen by this date’ kind of thing.”
Schools must submit an annual report with progress updates at the end of the academic year, and Faust said that she will hold schools accountable if change does not happen fast enough.
“The schools have been differentially speedy, or not, about implementing some of these things,” Faust said. “We will call them to account and say ‘where is this, has it moved forward enough,’ if schools turn out to be unduly slow.”
After releasing its report, the task force disbanded. The task force insisted that feedback and accountability would be crucial to ensuring progress as its members would not be involved in implementation.
“We had very explicitly recommended that there be a body to evaluate progress periodically,” Hyman said, suggesting a group like the one currently examining the University’s Title IX policy.
No such body exists, but Newell is considering how to measure whether the recommendations the University and its schools have adopted are working
“We’ve been talking about how we will look at the effectiveness of our own programs,” Newell said. “It’s really important when you create an educational program, you do your best to create something that you think is going to have an impact on people, but until you kind of assess that, you don’t know how effective you’re being… there have to be ways of testing to see if you’re having an impact, so we’re working on that.”
'Depended on the School'
In addition to the logistical challenges of coordinating efforts across Harvard’s schools, central administrators have intentionally granted schools substantial independence in an effort to remain sensitive to the schools’ distinct environments.  This has meant that adopting  recommendations—particularly relating to education and training—is essentially voluntary.
“Students have different experiences here and are likely to respond differently to different opportunities, ” Faust said in an interview. “The College is obviously overwhelmingly residential, with everyone in a very close geographical location 24/7. That’s not so true of other schools, and so asking what suits their culture and what is most likely to be effective within the parameters of what their students experience has been an important part of allowing for difference while making sure we coordinate across.”
This has meant that Title IX coordinators must seek to both standardize the trainings they develop while also tailoring them to the various populations they serve. For example, the College rolled out an online training module in September, and the Title IX office and Title IX coordinators are working to adapt it for some of the graduate and professional schools. The modules will retain some shared information, such as the University’s Title IX policy, but each school will customize it to reflect their students’ experiences.
Oeser said that OSAPR tailors its in-person trainings to specific groups or schools, and this degree of specificity is important for reaching quite different populations.
But these trainings are only mandatory for incoming students during orientation at every school, not on a yearly basis, despite the task force’s insistence.
Only the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and the Business School have effectively mandated annual sexual assault prevention training by tying completion of their online program to registration. The Divinity School, Medical School, and Dental School plan to follow suit next academic year. While the module the College administered in the fall was billed to students as “required,” 67 percent of students completed it and the remaining 33 percent faced no penalties.  The rest of Harvard’s schools have taken no action to require annual training for returning students since the task force report.
Schools and groups have to call OSAPR in to lead trainings, meaning they actively opt-in to the programming.
“We have contact with all the schools, and then the extent of programming has really depended on the school,” Oeser said.
For Hyman, though, instituting mandatory annual training is a “perfect example” of the need for central oversight. According to his research, one-time orientation trainings are “necessary but not sufficient.”
“Orientation is a complex time for students when they are concerned about many many issues, and while it’s a great introduction, for us to really feel that we have provided the necessary training and background, it would require what i call metaphorically ‘booster shots,’” Hyman said. “One of the reasons we wanted the Provost’s office to have responsibility was precisely to make sure that these kinds of recommendations that are very well grounded in the research literature don’t get forgotten or left behind.”
When asked if central administrators would ever require schools to conduct mandatory annual training, Faust replied, “We certainly will work with schools to push them towards fulfilling the recommendations of the task force.”
Variation between schools abounds not only in their students and environments, but also in the resources available to them.
While Whelsky said he considers the progress of implementation to be on target, funding the initiatives the task force called for is more challenging—particularly for smaller schools like the Divinity School. Central administrators, he said, should intervene more actively to ensure equity across schools.
“When it comes to the report and how those recommendations play out, I think there needs to be more concrete plans for how the center is going to support the schools in those initiatives,” he said. “This loops back to the resources issue—not every school has the same capacity and resources to be able to implement those recommendations, however willing they are too do so or how laudable they are, at the same rate and in the same way.”
Starkly varying sizes and alumni bases translate into significantly different financial realities—the Graduate School of Design, one of Harvard’s smaller schools, set its capital campaign goal at $110 million, compared to the Business School’s $1.3 billion goal, for example.
“The problem I think can be in the disparate resources across those communities,” Whelsky said. “The opportunities and options available to places like the Business School are very different, both in the size of the community and the resources, than they would be for a place like the Design School.”
In trying to act on the task force’s recommendations, Whelsky said “the lack of equitable resources is especially a tough thing for the Divinity School,” which enrolled only 323 students in the 2015-2016 academic year.
As a result of Harvard’s decentralized model, Faust said central administrators consistently grapple with funding disparities across schools.
“This is a constant in our ‘every tub on its own bottom’ universe, and I try to combine targeted help from the center on certain of these issues with help for the schools to figure out how they can afford to do what they want and need to do,” she said in an interview.
Reflecting on sexual assault prevention efforts to date, Hyman emphasized the need for sustained attention to what he described as a “serious chronic disease.”
“We would be naive to think that we could ever once and for all do something about sexual assault,” he said. “So we have to be vigilant about changing culture, changing mores, changing student populations over time.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 23, 2017 at 1:09 p.m. 
Though some Allston residents say they are concerned about the congestion Boston Calling could bring to their neighborhood this May, the popular music festival’s director said he is focused on involving local residents in the planning process.
Brian Appel, the director and CEO of Boston Calling, said his team will strive to keep Allston residents informed as they stage their largest festival yet. For the first time, Boston Calling will be take place at Harvard’s athletic facilities in Allston instead of Boston’s City Hall Plaza—a bigger venue that Appel said will allow the festival to grow.
“We wanted to find a bigger space because we felt that we wanted to book bigger bands, we wanted to invite more artists, we wanted to do things aside from just music, and City Hall Plaza wasn’t going to be able to accommodate that expansion,” Appel said in an interview.
But some Allston residents are worried that the festival’s move out of the city could bring traffic and safety concerns to a normally-quieter stretch of Western Ave. Last month, some Allstonians voiced concerns at a meeting of the Allston Construction Mitigation Subcommittee that the festival—which has drawn more than 20,000 attendees in previous years—could significantly disrupt the neighborhood.
Appel said he and his team have attended monthly community meetings to involve residents in their planning process. To address parking concerns, Appel said, they  hope to share a preliminary plan within the next few weeks.
“We’re spending a lot of time in the Allston community right now, making sure that residents know what’s going on, making sure that businesses know what’s happening. We just want the people that are most directly impacted by this event to feel like they are informed and that they are part of the process,” said Appel.
Appel said he hopes to provide the best experience for festival attendees, artists, and residents, as well as leaving the Harvard facilities “in better condition than how we found them.”
“If you run a poor event, it doesn’t matter if you made a lot of money, because you’re not going to be able to come back the next year,” Appel said. “We are hyperfocused on the details to make sure that it runs as smoothly as it possibly can.”
This year’s Boston Calling—set for May 26 to 28—will host 45 artists and bands including Chance the Rapper, Solange, Mumford & Sons, and Cage the Elephant. The festival will also feature a film series curated by Natalie Portman ’03.
“We think it might be a different audience that’s interested in going to see [the film programming] versus going to see Chance the Rapper,” Appel said.
While Appel said he has looked to successful festivals like New York City’s Governor’s Ball and California’s Coachella for inspiration, he wants Boston Calling to feel like a New England-specific event.
“Delivering the best event that New England has ever seen—that’s our goal,” said Appel.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Concerned with the rising price of textbooks, some students praised the Committee on Undergraduate Education’s move to include questions on the cost of course materials in this spring’s Q evaluations.
Earlier this month, the CUE discussed two new questions that will appear on this semester’s Q Guide, the College’s course and instructor evaluation system. One question will ask students how much they spent for each class, and the other for more details on the process of purchasing the materials.
“The goal is to find out more about course costs,” Elisabeth L. Laskin, assistant dean of Undergraduate Education, said at the CUE meeting earlier this month. “People talk about it a lot, but we don’t have any data to base it on. This is a way to start gathering this kind of data.”
The CUE has not yet decided whether the information collected from the questions will be available in future Q Guides. Still, some students, including Grace K. Carney ’19, said they were looking forward to the change.
“I think it’s a really good idea. Syllabi often don’t include the prices of textbooks, so this would make the whole process of buying book more transparent then it is now,” Carney said.
Undergraduate Council President Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18, who campaigned on a platform partly to make textbooks more affordable, said the Q Guide questions would be “one step forward” in a longer initiative to reduce the price of course materials.
“I am so pleased this is finally happening,” Sachee said. “I hate to see textbook costs as sometimes an inhibition for students when considering what courses they will take.”
Praising the new questions, Catherine J. Qin ’17 pointed a controversial $132 code students in an introductory economics course were required to purchase as an example of expensive course material prices. N. Gregory Mankiw, the course’s professor and textbook’s author, defended the new system’s price tag last semester and said he had negotiated with the publisher to obtain a lower price for Harvard students.
Other students, including Natasha M. Gonzalez ’20, said they thought including information on the price of materials in the Q Guide could impact how students decide which courses to take.
“Textbooks are really expensive, so knowing going into the course you’d have to spend so much money would be really helpful,” Gonzalez said. “Especially if you’re on the fence about a course, you could pick a less expensive course.”
Echoing Gonzalez, Christina H. Cruz ’20 said she had “mixed feelings” about the questions, which she said could dissuade students from taking classes with more expensive materials.
“It’s awesome because people get to know about it. I also feel like that would deter some students from taking classes they would otherwise take,” Cruz said. “As long as Harvard is good about providing financial aid it’s a great addition.”
Earlier this month, University President Drew G. Faust told members of the Undergraduate Council that she will ask Dean of the Faculty Michael D. Smith to address the cost of course materials at the Faculty's meeting in March.

A hacker purportedly attempted to access the Undergraduate Council's new software for processing funding applications this week, according to UC treasurer Nicholas D. Boucher ’19.
A third party with no ties to Harvard tried to hack the software, dubbed "nova" and rolled out earlier this month, on Feb. 20 at around 4 p.m., Boucher said. He added that hacks of the kind are common with software like nova, and that he and the Council’s Finance Committee—the group mainly tasked with reviewing grant applications—remain unconcerned.
“It was not a super-big deal,” he said. “Realistically, these things are commonplace in the technical world and like any good system, I built this system to withstand these things.”
Nova, which stands for New Online-system for Vetting Applications, launched earlier this semester and has so far processed 111 grants. While students still submit grant applications like they did in previous semesters, nova allows applicants to track the status of their grants online.
Each year, the UC is responsible for fulfilling thousands of funding requests to undergraduate student organizations. This year, the Council has roughly $300,000 in its coffers to fund student groups and events.
“Nova allows us as Finance Committee members to process interviews in a single interface, and by having all this data in a single interface, it allows users to track the status of the grant online,” Boucher said in an interview before the Finance Committee's Wednesday meeting. The platform also allows students to submit receipts online and view information about grant interviews.
Boucher also said he intends to make all nova data public, as the UC’s budget is partially funded by students. Each academic year, the College asks students to pay an optional $75 UC Activities fee.
“In the future there will be a public-facing portal where people can see raw data about who we give grants to, how much we give grants for, the types of things for which we give grants. We’re just going to make that publicly available,” he said. “At the end of the day, it is student money that we’re giving out.”
During the Finance Committee's meeting Wednesday night, the group recommended to distribute $8,659.35 in grants. The UC as a whole will decide whether or not to go ahead with the Finance Committee’s recommendations at its next general meeting on Sunday. Typically, the Committee has a $10,000 weekly budget, from which Boucher said the body rarely deviates. .

Singer, songwriter, and actress Rihanna will receive the Harvard University Humanitarian of the Year award, the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations announced Wednesday.
Known for chart-toppers like “Umbrella,” “Work,” and “Disturbia,” Rihanna has also worked with organizations to promote access to education for children in developing countries. In 2012, she founded the nonprofit Clara Lionel Foundation to honor her grandparents, Clara and Lionel Braithwaite. She became the Global Ambassador for the Global Partnership in Education in 2016.
Rihanna will be honored on Feb. 28 at a ceremony in Sanders Theatre. Tickets will be available beginning at noon that day.
“Rihanna has charitably built a state-of- the-art center for oncology and nuclear medicine to diagnose and treat breast cancer at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Bridgetown, Barbados,” Counter wrote in a press release. “It is for these philanthropic initiatives and other acts of compassionate sharing that the students and faculty of the Harvard Foundation chose to honor Rihanna with the 2017 Humanitarian of the Year Award.”
The Harvard Foundation presents the Peter J. Gomes Humanitarian of the Year to recognize “prominent public-spirited leaders each year in honor of the late Reverend Professor Peter J. Gomes,” according to a press release from the Foundation. Gomes was the Plummer Professor of Christian Morals at the Harvard Divinity School and the Pusey Minister at Memorial Church for over three decades.
Last year, the selection of Myanmar leader and Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi drew criticism from some Muslim students at Harvard for her perceived silence toward the country’s Muslim minority. Her lecture occurred as planned with a few protesters standing silently outside the event.
Rihanna joins a collection of Humanitarian of the Year honorees that include activists, entertainers, politicians, and scientists. In previous years, Kailash Satyarthi, Malala Yousafzai, Dolores Huerta, James Earl Jones, and Ban Ki-Moon have received the award.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lawyers for Harvard's student unionization effort and the University presented arguments to the National Labor Relations Board in Boston Wednesday, kicking off a hearing that could determine the outcome of last year’s too-close-to-call unionization election.
The hearing, which could determine whether undergraduate teaching fellows and graduate teaching fellows and research assistants at Harvard can form a union, will address two issues over the coming weeks: challenge ballots submitted by voters whose eligibility is in dispute and objections filed by both union organizers and the University about the election.
Per an order from NLRB Regional Director John J. Walsh, Jr., the hearing will continue until March 3. If discussions have not concluded by that date, the hearing will resume on March 13.
Before the hearing started, Thomas A. Miller, the NLRB hearing officer, said he would accept post-hearing briefs from both parties. After reading the briefs, Miller will submit recommendations to Walsh, who will rule on the issues in the case.
On Wednesday, lawyers for Harvard and the union effort discussed whether specific categories of voters who voted under challenge should be considered eligible.
“Our position is very straightforward. We contend that doctoral students who have been employed in the bargaining unit for at least one semester during the academic year prior to the election itself, and who were not, at the time of the election, in their dissertation year, are eligible to vote,” said Thomas W. Meiklejohn, an attorney for the unionization effort, during opening arguments.
Meiklejohn argued that graduate students who had been previously employed as teaching or research assistants would likely be re-employed in a future semester, and thus had a “continuing” employment relationship with Harvard. The two parties had previously stipulated in a pre-election agreement those students would be eligible to vote under challenge in November’s election.
Citing prior NLRB decisions, Meiklejohn asserted there should be a “lookback period” to allow students who had worked at most one year prior to the election to vote.
University counsel Joseph P. McConnell reiterated Harvard’s stance against allowing doctoral students who were not employed as academic workers during the election to have their ballots counted.
“It is Harvard’s contention that none of these individuals should be counted,” McConnell said. “There should be no lookback period. And it’s certainly not an anathema to the Board’s policies that there not be a lookback period. ”
The University’s legal team also called Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Dean for Administration and Finance Allen Aloise and GSAS Dean for Admissions and Financial Aid Mohan D. Boodram to testify about the University’s financial support and employment policies for graduate students at the hearing.
The hearing comes after months of uncertainty about whether Harvard students will unionize. After the November election, the vote count was delayed as Harvard and union organizers discussed which challenged ballots should be counted.
But Harvard and the union did not resolve every challenged ballot—313 remained disputed.
A Dec. vote count showed that 1,456 of the tallied ballots opposed unionization, while 1,272 supported it. Since the margin between votes for and against the union was smaller than the number of challenged ballots, the NLRB will resolve which challenged ballots will be counted.
Over the course of the hearing, the NLRB will also decide whether objections filed by the University and the union are valid. The union organizers argue that the NLRB should call for a re-vote, asserting Harvard’s lists of eligible voters were incomplete and prevented eligible students from casting ballots.
Harvard, meanwhile, objected to a single ballot that the NLRB marked void because the voter wrote a message to the vote counter and drew a smiley face.

UPDATED: February 27, 2017 at 7:57 p.m.
The article accompanying these annotations can be found here.
Last March, a University-wide task force dedicated studying sexual assault prevention released its wide-ranging final report. In its 20-page document, the task force made a number of recommendations for how Harvard could better combat sexual assault on campus, including hiring an additional administrator and mandating annual training for all students.
Below, The Crimson annotates some of the report's key recommendations.
University President Drew G. Faust required each of Harvard’s 13 schools to submit an implementation plan at the start of the fall semester to her office and the Office of the Provost, detailing sexual assault prevention measures they would undertake during the 2016-2017 academic year. All schools submitted plans, and former University Title IX Officer Mia Karvonides and Alicia Oeser, the Director of the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, met with administrators at each school to review them in the fall.
The University has not appointed an administrator in the Provost’s office exclusively dedicated to overseeing sexual assault prevention efforts. Instead, Deputy Provost Peggy Newell has assumed this responsibility in addition to her usual duties. Newell said for now, she will continue to fill the role. “For the time being, it’s going to continue to be my responsibility,” Newell said. “As long as what the task force wanted to get done is getting done, and as long as all of our other initiatives are moving forward, and we’re doing what needs to be done, that may not be the best use of a position.”
While many of Harvard’s schools conducted required in-person sexual assault prevention trainings at new student orientations, most have not mandated training for returning students.
Many graduate and professional schools are working to customize the online module debuted by the College last fall, and plan to deliver it to their students next fall. Some will tie completion of the module to registration, making it mandatory for students across all class years. Other schools only require training for incoming students.
The College implemented a “required” online annual sexual assault prevention training module for undergraduates last September, though students currently face no penalties for failing to finish the program. As of January 2017, roughly 67 percent of undergraduates had chosen to complete the module.
The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences requires all students to complete online training in order to register. This academic year, the training had a 99 percent completion rate. GSAS also provides in-person orientation training and TF-specific programming.
The Law School debuted a new online training module and revamped orientation training on sexual assault prevention in the fall, but training is currently only mandatory for first-year students. Title IX coordinators are working to tweak this training to incorporate student feedback, according to Dean of Students Marcia L. Sells. In an interview in September, Sells said administrators are considering making training mandatory for second-year and third-year Law students next year.
The Medical School is modifying the College’s online training module and will make it mandatory for all students in the fall. The school does not offer in-person training.
The Divinity School has required online training for all students through its own Prezi platform, but starting next year it will tie completion of a customized version of the College’s module to student registration. The school also provides mandatory in-person programming during orientation.
Since 2014, The Dental School has included online Title IX training as part of its new student orientation programming. Administrators are currently working to customize the College’s online training module and plan to roll it out and tie it to registration in the fall.
At the School of Public Health, the Office of Student Affairs has required incoming students to complete an online module, but training is not required for returning students.
The Business School requires all students to review a PowerPoint before registering for classes and holds in-person trainings for first-year sections in the fall.
The Kennedy School has mandatory orientation training for new students, led partly by returning students. Training is not required for returning students.
The Graduate School of Education provides a training session at new student orientation. At the beginning of the semester, the school launched a new online module that all students must complete next fall in order to register.
The Graduate School of Design’s first-year orientation includes mandatory sexual assault prevention programming, but it has not yet employed online training or required returning students to complete trainings.
The College, which established a BGLTQ Office for Student Life prior to the report’s release, has taken several steps to enhance its resources for BGLTQ undergraduates. Administrators hired a new BGLTQ Office staffer and are planning to move the Office to a new space in Harvard Yard. The Medical School is the only graduate or professional school with a full-time administrator dedicated to BGLTQ students. Four schools provide no resources specifically for BGLTQ students.
The College created a new position—Assistant Director—in the BGLTQ Office of Student Life and hired Khánh-Anh Lê to fill it. Administrators also plan to relocate the Office to a new, larger space in Harvard Yard.
The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences worked with BGLTQ students in developing and testing their new online training and launched an awareness campaign.
Law School spokesperson Michelle Deakin wrote in an emailed statement that the school “has no updates to report” when asked about additional support for BGLTQ students
The Medical School provides resources specifically for BGLTQ students through its Office of Recruitment and Multicultural Affairs and LGBT Program Director Jessica Halem in its Office for Diversity Inclusion and Community Partnership.
The Divinity School recently hired a new Assistant Dean for Student Affairs who has experience working with BGLTQ populations, and many of the school’s Peer Advocates on sexual assault prevention identify as BGLTQ.
BGLTQ students at the Dental School have access to the resources offered by Medical School LGBT Program Director Jessica Halem, according to the Dental School’s Director of Student Affairs, Carrie Sylven.
The School of Public Health does not provide specific resources for BGLTQ students.
The Business School does not provide specific resources for BGLTQ students.
The Kennedy School does not provide specific resources for BGLTQ students.
The Graduate School of Education has an administrative intern who focuses on programming for BGLTQ students.
The Graduate School of Design does not provide additional resources for BGLTQ students.

University President Drew G. Faust in May 2016 accepted a proposal from Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana to regulate Harvard students’ off-campus social life, breaking a 30-year pattern of administrative distance from the University’s unrecognized social groups. Khurana’s policy, slated to take effect for the Class of 2021, bars members of final clubs, sororities, and fraternities from receiving College endorsement for prestigious fellowships and from certain holding leadership positions on campus. But a new faculty committee could significantly re-work the policy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

As of last Sunday, the Harvard men’s basketball team officially clinched one of four spots in the inaugural Ivy League conference tournament.
With both Columbia and Penn tied for fourth place in the league with 4-6 records in conference play, the Crimson has a four-game buffer with four regular season games remaining. With a Lions-Quakers matchup on the books for this weekend, however, one of the teams is guaranteed to fall further behind, giving Harvard a guaranteed spot.
But for coach Tommy Amaker and his players, the clinched spot is nothing major to celebrate, as there is still room to move up.
“Never settle for second place when first is still available,” Amaker said, paraphrasing an adage from President John F. Kennedy ‘40. “Last I checked, first is still available. It’s not like this is all said and done.”
Though Amaker would go on to discuss how important it was to stress this message to his players, when senior co-captain Siyani Chambers came in to speak to the media minutes later, it became clear that there was no miscommunication between the coaching staff in the players.
“We always talk about, if first place is in sight, why would we settle for second?” Chambers said. “We’re still trying to go for first place and get that Ivy League title, the regular season Ivy League title, so we’re going into every practice with that same intensity and that fight and that drive to make that push.”
In fact, Amaker added that he wasn’t even aware his team had clinched a spot in the tournament until his players informed him. While many have alluded to a seeming inevitability that Princeton will run away with the regular season title, currently undefeated in Ancient Eight play, Harvard is two games back and has four games remaining on the schedule—including one against the Tigers—to raise the Ivy banner.
Up next on the Crimson’s road to the tournament is Yale (14-9, 6-4 Ivy League) and Brown (11-15, 2-8). As it plays its last home games of the season, Harvard (16-7, 8-2) will recognize its senior class—composed of Chambers, co-captain Corbin Miller, forward Zena Edosomwan, and guard Matt Fraschilla—in a pregame ceremony on Saturday night.
Both the Bulldogs and the Bears come into the weekend with something to prove, as the duo was handily swept last weekend by Princeton and Penn. Although Harvard swept these two teams when it played them two weeks ago on the road, the Crimson has struggled with consistency during games this season, with both Yale and Brown giving the team scares in the respective contests.
When facing Yale on Friday, Amaker has emphasized the need to win the battle of the boards. Last time the two teams met, the Bulldogs, who leads the league in rebounds, had just one more board than the Crimson, but held a 20-14 advantage on the glass in the first half—the period in which Yale led.
“It’s a rivalry game, it’s Yale,” Chambers said. “No matter if it’s basketball, football, squash, water polo, golf, whatever it is, its big.”
When Brown comes to town on Saturday night, Harvard will play with the hopes of sending the seniors out of Lavietes Pavilion on a high note.
“We always say to [the younger players], ‘God willing, you younger guys, you’re going to be an older guy one day. You’re going to want these young guys to want to send you out the right way’,” Amaker said. “It’s hard for them to even think about that right now because they’re freshmen, sophomores. They can’t think about next week let alone two years or three years, but as a veteran guy you want and hope that the younger guys are really thinking of them.”
To accomplish that against the Bears will involve improved transition defense. The first half saw the Crimson defense caught on its heels, with Brown’s offense juggernauts Steven Spieth and Obi Okolie taking advantage of turnovers and slow transitions.
Amaker admittedly noted that the team’s current position of holding a tournament spot is new territory, as the league to the implications of a new playoff tournament, and he doesn’t know exactly how the team will handle the circumstances of knowing that it is guaranteed to play past the regular season finale. Additionally, as the 2015-2016 team was long eliminated from NCAA Tournament contention by this point in the season, the pressure of moving onto the postseason is new for both the freshmen and the sophomores.
“I think all of the seniors are in the same position—Corbin, Zena, and Matt—where we just want to take all these guys under our wing and just try to instill what we know,” Chambers said. “We have a lot of young guys, not just freshmen but sophomores who weren’t in this position last year. We really just want to show them the way, pass down our experience so even when the become juniors, they become sophomores, in reality they feel like veteran guys.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two weeks ago, junior Alyssa Mehta set up a Facebook event asking for “all the support and noise that we can get!” If you had just gone to that one game, you would have thought that squash had a cult following. You would be wrong—the team doesn’t get nearly the support it deserves. But it wouldn’t be a mistake to call the team a cult of success.
It seems almost pointless to mention the team’s undefeated season, or that the Crimson is a two-time defending national champion, or that it has arguably the best woman in collegiate squash. You can’t just say that coach Mike Way led the team to victory in his first two seasons, took it easy the next year, lost just one game since—against Penn—and is looking to tie the program’s record for the most championships.
Just call Harvard good. Really, really, good. Like squash the competition good.
But let’s be more precise—how accomplished is this team? This past weekend, the men’s squash team lost 5-4 to Trinity in the national championship game. With that defeat, and probably without it, women’s squash now indisputably stands as the most high-powered Harvard program. Coincidentally, that men’s squash allowed the Trinity men to tie the Crimson women in  title count.
It’s fitting that the women travel to Princeton this weekend. Harvard will attempt win three more games en route to a perfect season, which would give the program the Howe Cup for yet another year. But the Crimson has a chance to shake history in an even more momentous way.
With a win over the Tigers, the Crimson can tie Princeton for the most women’s squash titles ever—17, to be exact.
But as in most areas of history, this past is complicated.
During the 1950s and 1960s women’s squash was a niche sport, dominated by the Howe matriarchy. Margaret Howe, the mother of the clan, and her two daughters won a combined 10 national singles titles. But the family did not tire of their victories. Instead, Betty Howe Constable, as Princeton’s head coach, created a college division for her Tigers to win 10 out of the first 12 titles.
Greatness can’t be bought. For years, the rest of the world has levied that complaint against New England. The same logic applies to those Princeton titles.
So it goes that Harvard, which has built its legacy as the sport has grown more and more competitive, can be declared as its discipline’s greatest dynasty.
The operative question right now is how the team shapes up against other reigns of dominance in other sports. As a Bostonian, I have a special place in my heart reserved for number 17. Banner 17 hangs in the TD Garden to commemorate streaks of brilliance. Coincidentally the Garden is the place where Harvard men’s hockey won its first Beanpot title in 24 years. Seventeen is also the number of titles that the team most hated in the Garden holds.
I can mention the Canadians, mostly because they hold only the second-highest amount of professional championships, but my New England identity won’t allow me to talk about the team at the top.
Admittedly, comparing a non-big-four sport to pro basketball might not be justified. But in terms of recency, Harvard women’s squash deserves special mention. The team has achieved so much success in an era hostile to dynasties.
Moving onto college sports, Connecticut’s women probably has the most legitimate argument for the most dominant sports dynasty at the present.
Until the Huskies lose their first game in 2017, it’s not worth considering the Crimson women as a real competitor. But dynasties, before they are ranked, must be built. And building is what women’s squash is doing.
Even with the gleam of the recent success, the team’s future looks even brighter. Sophomore Sabrina Sobhy is the talk of the town, which highlights the team’s youth movement. Former British national team partners, freshman duo Gina Kennedy and Amelia Henley, have joined American counterparts to bolster the Crimson. Sophomore Kayley Leonard rounds out the top four, meaning that the team’s top spots are all filled by current underclassmen.
Harvard graduates four players this year, and while their departures won’t devastate the team’s play, their presence will most certainly be missed. After the first and second waves of games are finished, the team crowds around, cheering, to watch the final matches. The program isn’t rooting for another 9-0 victory but rather to move forward as a team.
As time goes on, the team seems to get stronger and stronger, writing more history along the way. The next chapter remains to be written this weekend.

There's something despairing about leaping from server to server when you're trying to get work done. Harvard University, Harvard Secure, Harvard Guest, and yes, even Harvard Wifi Set-Up. We've tried them all, and all of them constantly disappoint us.
There's absolutely nothing more dreaded than seeing the flippant "trying to connect" message pop up on Google Docs when your paper is due in 20 minutes. You would think that the richest university in the world would have enough money to keep its wifi servers up and running, but alas, Harvard ~boasts~ what is possibly the least reliable wifi network in the world. Don't believe us? Here are some things that are way more reliable than Harvard's wifi:
The Chip Selection at the JFK Street CVS
This CVS always comes in clutch with a beautiful array of chips, curated so you'll see them the moment you enter the store...unless it's 11 p.m. on a weeknight. Then, there's probably only 2 bags of plain Lays left and a sad jar of Tostitos Spinach Artichoke Dip. If you go at the right time, the harvest is bountiful. If not, you'll have to trudge all the way over to the other CVS and scavenge. Especially scarring if you're a freshman. The worst part? There's no guarantee that they'll have the snack item you want. But even with this spotty selection, we can rely on CVS more than Harvard's wifi.
New England Weather
So let's get this straight: the region was blanketed by back-to-back snowstorms just a few weeks ago, and now Cambridge is gliding between high 60s and low 50s. We went from Canada Goose central to people thinking it’s acceptable to wear basketball shorts again. The piles of freshly fallen snow are already melting (read: gone), and we didn’t even get to sled down Widener’s steps. What’s next? Hail? A tornado? There’s no guessing. In a way, New England's unreliably weather has become quite reliable in that it's consistently inconsistent. You at least know what you're getting yourself into. But Harvard's wifi will work perfectly for a week straight, right until you desperately need it.
Getting your printer to work
Another realm where Harvard technology fails us is in the printing. It takes approximately 300 years and one of your kidneys to set it up, and often documents get lost in the grid, costing you $.05 for nothing but disappointment. Although it’s certainly a process, most of the time if you cry and spend too much time working on it, your paper will finally be printed. When it comes to the wifi, there’s nothing you can do but hope and offer a sacrifice to the internet gods.
That Kid Who Never Does Work for Your Group Assignment
We all know this kid, and we all hate him with the fiery passion of a thousand suns. You text him, email him, maybe even send him a written letter to his mailbox—still, nothing. He leaves you on read, and if he does respond, it’s to tell you how busy he is. If you’re lucky, he’ll pull through with 24 hours to spare, and will maybe toss in a few grammatical corrections and a couple sentences here and there. After all, you’re in this together. The wifi, however, owes you nothing.
Hopefully, someone in Harvard IT will realize that the general student populace is suffering and will have mercy on us. Until then, we'll just keep praying to those wifi gods. 
P.S. The wifi stopped working a total of 15 times while this piece was being written. How fun!
