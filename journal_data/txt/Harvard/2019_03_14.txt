After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every Marvel origin story must tick a few standard boxes. First, transform an ordinary civilian into a shiny new vigilante through happenstance or a billion-dollar invention. Next, engage aforementioned superhero in witty banter with a lesser sidekick and hand-to-hand combat with a certified evil nemesis who allegorizes one of the seven cardinal sins. Finally, induct the superhero into the ever-expanding roster of Spandex-clad Avenger affiliates.
21 films into its ludicrously profitable hero saga, the capitalist steam engine that is the Marvel cinematic universe shows no signs of slowing. Yet with a global audience as vast as this one, which includes a crop of savvy audiences and canny critics, the formula is so airtight it’s getting suffocated. With a few, subversive exceptions — last year’s Oscar-winning “Black Panther,” for example, or the superbly animated “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” — the superhero origin plot has dragged itself through one too many half-hearted battles. Marvel must now either subvert the formula in some subtle way, or else fall back on masquerading the same tired plot under ostentatious special effects.
Helmed by indie film veterans Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, “Captain Marvel” does a little of both, primarily by foreclosing the origin story from its own titular heroine. On Hala, home planet of the Kree alien race, Vers (Brie Larson) trains in combat under the guidance of her mentor, Yon-Rogg (Jude Law), in preparation for a mission against the Skrulls, shapeshifting enemies of the Kree, led by Talos (Ben Mendelsohn). All the while, Vers consults the all-knowing Supreme Intelligence (who takes the form of Annette Bening) about her enigmatic past — which is so mysterious that even Vers cannot remember it.
When the Skrull mission goes awry, Vers crash-lands on Earth, also known as “Planet C-53,” through the roof of a Blockbuster in Los Angeles, 1995. A high-speed train chase sequence and the introduction of young Nick Fury (a convincingly digitally de-aged Samuel L. Jackson) later, Vers learns that the Skrulls are after Dr. Wendy Lawson, a now-deceased scientist whose secretive studies may contain the seeds for a powerful weapon. But when Vers discovers photographic evidence that she herself may have had a life on Earth, uncovering the truth about Lawson’s work becomes a personal mission. With the help of Fury, a few old friends, and a cat named Goose, Vers must learn to navigate a world of rapidly changing loyalties and uncover her true identity.
Admittedly, “Captain Marvel” relies on the same formulas as its predecessors. Besides a little tampering with the plot conventions and a midpoint plot twist, it barely toes the lines of the strictures of its genre. But Larson commands the screen with a loose energy and casual verve more typical of her male counterparts than, say, Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow or Elizabeth Olsen’s Scarlet Witch. Its retro vibe textures the film with throwback nostalgia. Boden and Fleck pack the lion’s share of its runtime with knowing nods to ‘90s pop culture, from the Radio Shack next door to Blockbuster, to No Doubt’s “Just a Girl,” which plays winkingly over a battle sequence. “Captain Marvel” is not the greatest superhero film to grace the screen, but it is immensely fun. And when was the last time a Marvel superhero had this much fun?
Undeniably, the absence of a Marvel female superhero standalone film — given the constant proliferation of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which has thus far included three actors playing versions of the same character — has always felt like a notable void. Yet coupling Carol Danvers and Captain Marvel as the same entity is a relatively recent invention, the work of comic book artist Kelly Sue DeConnick. DeConnick gave a feminist revamp to “Ms. Marvel,” who previously donned knee-high boots and a swimsuit with midriff-baring cutouts. That history is telling in itself: Even now, “Captain Marvel”’s origins make it hard to map modern feminism onto an antiquated persona. DeConnick’s revision of Carol Danvers complexly imagines the character as a U.S. Air Force pilot. In the iconic uniform, Larson lends a steely-eyed determination to Danvers, giving her a certain devil-may-care edge. Or as Fury puts it, “You look like someone’s disaffected niece.” It’s telling, too, that Captain Marvel has no boyfriend, as a story of self-discovery and self-definition replaces a tired heterosexual love arc. Unlike Black Widow’s skintight black Lycra jumpsuit or Wonder Woman’s gold metallic bustier, Captain Marvel’s suit is protective and androgynous, her hair scraped into a battle-ready mohawk. In short, it’s not the kind of costume conducive to interview inquiries about the wearer’s underwear.  
Yet Larson, who won an Oscar in 2015 for her performance in “Room,” also makes room for the heroine’s vulnerability. As authorities in her life insist again and again that she must learn to rein in her impulses and control her temper, the great thematic twist is that Captain Marvel weaponizes emotion into her strongest suit, slightly more convincingly than DC’s 2017 Wonder Woman.
Danvers’ duality between strength and vulnerability carries her beyond the level of stock character, even if only slightly. Too often, regular women (let alone female superheroes) are emotionally policed to the brink of exhaustion: for not smiling enough, for being “shrill,” for being a nag, a bitch, a slut. Even before its theatrical release, “Captain Marvel”’s apparent feminist subtext had already earned the film a legion of hateful Internet trolls intent on sabotage. Before the film was even released, a teaser trailer met misogynistic backlash because Captain Marvel didn’t smile once. This film treats female emotion not only as legitimate, but as immensely powerful.
Despite all this supposed progress, it’s certainly possible to object to the film on the terms of its self-identification as a feminist fairy tale. It feels insidious for a major motion picture to stylize its feminist bent as an earnest attempt at updating the superhero mythos for the post-#MeToo 21st century, rather than what it likely is: a carefully calculated move by Disney studio executives after months of focus groups and market research, designed to maximize box office profits for a company whose leadership is largely comprised of men — an effort that has, in part, been shadily abetted by the U.S. army. 
So, does a studio’s self-serving motive efface the effects of releasing a big-budget superhero flick starring a powerful female lead? Not necessarily. Even a middling movie can be a type of victory, symbolic of a narrative ecology capacious enough to let some female-driven films fail or merely achieve mediocrity. And the implications for its viewers — particularly the impressionable, young, female demographic — are certainly hard to ignore. Imagery and dialogue gesture at women’s advancement in the sciences, as well as the power of female role models. “Maybe I’ll build a spaceship,” a little girl tells Fury during the film. “You don’t know.”
“He doesn’t,” Danvers affirms knowingly.
Ultimately, whether the film succeeds as a work of feminist literature and whether it succeeds as a high-quality superhero movie are two different questions. The answer to both is, frankly, a halfhearted shrug. Idealizing the film as an answer to a long-standing feminist question feels incorrect, but so does disparaging it as inconsequential. “I’ve been fighting with one arm behind my back,” Captain Marvel realizes out loud toward the film’s conclusion. What would it be like to be finally set free?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After being accepted into Harvard last December, I was looking forward to seeing all the opportunities that I would be provided. But one thing that I was shocked by was the lack of choice in my meal plan. Though some schools’ systems are incredibly complex, with dining points, dining dollars, fixed swipes, and a ton of other terminology, Harvard is on the opposite side of the spectrum. Its plan is simple, yet incredibly vague and uncertain in dictating what it provides.
Three thousand, 275 dollars and 50 cents. That is the cost for “boarding” at Harvard per semester this year, also known as the amount we pay for access to the dining halls. This is also the only plan that we have here at Harvard, so there is basically one choice in how we spend our money on food. Furthermore, there isn’t a swipe count — a concrete number of what we’ve used and what we have left. Instead, there’s a simple rule of swiping in by meal. What happens to those swipes that aren’t used because of a missed breakfast or a busy evening? Poof, they disappear.
And maybe it’s just me, but, until my third month here, I didn’t even know about BoardPlus — the $65 per semester automatically given to students, dedicated for swiping guests into the dining halls or for use at campus eateries. BoardPlus is a nice treat, but it comes to us from our boarding fee — giving us a sense of “freedom” when really it’s just a small allocation of money we’ve already spent.
I could come up with a few reasons as to why Harvard’s dining plan is structured the way it is. One may be to ensure that Harvard University Dining Services workers are paid for their work, which is, of course, an important matter. Factoring in maintenance, utilities, and other costs only makes the cost of operations even greater. Perhaps Harvard wants to ensure that all of these costs will continue to be met by enforcing a meal plan on every individual.
However, this all might just be a way, as Harvard is best known, to make money. According to experts analyzing the University of Pennsylvania’s dining services, if university dining holds a monopoly on food on campus, it may be able to charge hungry students extremely high rates.
From a student’s perspective, my main issue with Harvard’s current system is the lack of flexibility. If a student doesn’t use half of their swipes or wants to reduce the cost of living by just eating cereal in their dorm room, I believe that they should have the option to pay less in boarding fees.
College is also many people’s first chance to experience the world for themselves. People here on campus are busy searching for what makes them unique and developing their sense of independence. But living on dining hall food doesn’t last forever. Eventually, students should learn to plan their meals, allocate time to cooking and cleaning, and become fully-functioning adults. If Harvard wants to train us to be the next leaders of the world, they’re going to have to let us develop those simple skills.
I realize that there are a variety of options available for students who want to devote themselves to pursuing that kind of independence. The Dudley Co-Op, for example, is a group of students who live in a communal environment, cooking their own meals, keeping after themselves, and having the perk of paying a reduced housing fee. However, the Co-Op is comprised of only 30 students, making it a relatively inaccessible option. There are also kitchens in some dorms and around campus, but since we’re paying fully for dining hall food anyway, there isn’t any motivation to devote ourselves to cooking out of our own pocket.
Harvard seeks to give us the education we need to be successful, but it fails to address and advocate for some basic aspects of adulthood. Though I know that adjusting the dining system would require a great amount of investigation, I think that it is a worthwhile topic to be discussed further. Students should have the option to choose where their money is going, whether that means reducing their meal plan or paying for ingredients and produce over cafeteria meals. In considering this change, Harvard will continue to support its students in developing the independence that will allow us to enjoy the fruits of our labors later on in life.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The first week of March was a hectic one on Harvard’s campus. Many juniors spent the weekend going to various festivities for Junior Family Weekend. Many others spent hours in their favorite study spots in anticipation of the start of midterm season. And, on top of all of this, there was a snowstorm on the third night of the month that left the Boston area covered in almost a foot of snow.
Former Dean of Students Archie C. Epps III once remarked that “Harvard University will close only for an act of God, such as the end of the world.” Indeed, the University was open for normal operations that Monday, and students were notified of that fact in emails sent both the night prior and morning of.
I woke up on Monday dreading the journey to class. Even as a native New Englander, this winter has been an especially difficult one. I decided to wear my work pants (covered in exterior paint from my summer job), tied my boots, put on a hoodie and a jacket, and braced myself for a trek through the snow.
When I opened the dorm door, however, I saw the one thing I did not anticipate: pavement. In fact, as I walked through Harvard Yard and beyond, pavement was all I saw. The trek to Northwest Labs that I anticipated lasting 20 sock-drenching minutes was over in its normal time, and my feet were warm as ever. I was amazed at what felt like a March miracle, but then I thought about my first two semesters at Harvard.
The first of March was not the first time in the 2018-19 school year that it snowed in Harvard Yard, nor was it the first time that I had a too-easy walk to my classes. It was the first time, though, that I had not expected to have an easy path to class. Frankly, I was disappointed in myself. It took a winter storm warning for me to realize the effortless journey through Harvard I had accepted as normal was actually something to cherish.
I think many of us take for granted the clear-pathed and lively Yard that we walk through every day. I certainly did. That is a huge testament to how amazing the Harvard Landscape Maintenance team is.
New England winters are relentless, and both plowing and shoveling during a winter storm are ridiculously difficult. My dad owns three pizza stores, and he dreads nothing more than having to plow his stores’ parking lots. On top of the objective physical difficulty of shoveling and plowing (the latter can do a toll on your arms, back, and general body due to heat inside the cab), shoveling snow with the intention of completely clearing pavement is mentally fatiguing, as well.
The objective of completely clearing a walkway of snow is a war of attrition. You can’t let snow pile up too much, or the snow on the bottom will freeze, leaving black ice for people to slip on when everything is shoveled. As a result, shoveling snow during a snowstorm is an hours-long rotation between plowing, shoveling, and salting. All the while, your body gets very hot, but if you take your coat or other layers off for too long, your body will get a chill that takes hours to recover from.
Trying to win against snow is an all-around thankless task, and we are lucky enough to benefit from the work of men and women who do just that on a regular basis. On multiple occasions, I’ve had to dodge trucks plowing through Harvard Yard in the middle of the night. I’ve passed people shoveling the stairs of Lamont at 3 a.m. The men and women driving those trucks and wielding those shovels are doing the work that no one wants to do, the work that makes thousands of people’s lives easier. And they deserve a thank you.
So the next time you want to complain about our lack of snow days, I encourage you to thank a member of the Landscape Maintenance team instead. It is their work — work that is so consistently spectacular that it often goes completely unnoticed — that keeps Harvard going, wind, rain, or shine.
So thank you, Harvard Landscaping Maintenance team. Only the end of the world might stop you — and I strongly emphasize the “might.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As it stands, the Undergraduate Council’s $650,000 annual budget does not match the cost of many of its goals. As a result, the UC has expressed a desire to expand partnership programs under its administration, including one with ridesharing app Lyft, umbrella sharing service UmbraCity, and College X Change, a student-developed platform for buying and selling items. These partnerships are intended to benefit students with discounts on services in exchange for access to the student body for the companies.
Though we have often been critical of its fiscal and programmatic policies in the past, we applaud the UC for their strategy of partnering with companies to enhance student life. We believe that trading access to the student body for goods and services that would help students in their everyday lives is, to put it bluntly, a good deal. If adequate resources are not provided in the budget for all of the UC’s goals, it seems wise to exchange advertising and access to students as a resource.
We understand concerns that some students may feel inundated with advertising by the UC’s new partnerships, as advertisements are already a constant presence in their daily lives. However, the benefits these partnerships may bring students — with the potential to improve aspects of student life — is worth the extra advertising.
A partnership with Lyft in particular would be an excellent way for the UC to help students who live in the Quad, who often struggle with the lengthy commute to and from classes and other activities in the Harvard Square area. Students in the Quad often bear the long walk in the pelting rain and over slippery sidewalks. Late at night many students would reasonably feel unsafe walking nearly a mile back home. Cab services are expensive and the shuttle system is notoriously inconsistent. As a result, the UC’s burgeoning partnership with Lyft has the potential to meet an enormous student need.
It’s worth mentioning that the UC’s business oriented solutions may still leave out low-income students. For example, some students may not be able to afford Lyft services, even with a discount. Therefore, it is incumbent upon the University to more systematically and directly address the student challenges the UC is addressing through its partnerships, so that all students regardless of financial means have access to the best campus services. The UC might provide some power for temporary solutions, but ultimately the University must address the structural inconsistencies and shortcomings that have led to problems, like the inequitable Quad-Yard commute.
Nevertheless, until these problems are properly tackled by the University, we hope the UC will continue to leverage the partnership program as a tool for improving student life. Though we’ve often found the UC’s efforts lacking, this program is a step (or a Lyft ride) in the right direction.

It was dark on Great Gull Island and I was in a candlelit room, sitting at a wooden table with about a dozen other volunteers. Donna, a squat woman in her mid-fifties and an avid birdwatcher, was talking to Mike, a barrel-chested freediver, about his research.
Next to me, the few volunteers my age were laughing about a joke I had missed. Several seats away, Helen, who started the Great Gull Island Project in 1969, was explaining the island’s history as a military base.
My gaze flits about, observing but avoiding eye contact. Spontaneous conversation — bringing with it the potential to be ignored, embarrassed, or shut down — terrifies me. Popular culture references go over my head, my pleasantries become jumbled, I’m often accused of being expressionless, and I have trouble telling if one of us is talking too much or too little.
In moments like these, I try to erase all uncertainty, mapping the conversation’s trajectory before it’s begun. Greetings and potential responses; open-ended questions and ensuing topics; follow-up questions and my own anecdotes; multiple failsafes — all forming a diagram of forking conversation paths.
I longed to hear about Mike’s diving, join the adjacent laughter, or learn about the island’s past. It would have been as easy as saying, “Wow, that’s fascinating,” but in the moment, I was overwhelmed by the overlapping conversation-diagrams forming in my mind. I contemplated ways I might jump in, but by the time I thought of something, the various groups had moved on to new topics.; aAfter half an hour, during which I stayed silent, everyone went to bed.
***
For two weeks in the summer before 11th grade, I lived on the misnamed Great Gull Island, helping the resident ornithologists catch some of the island’s 10,000 common terns in chicken-wire boxes — once before dawn, and then again at dusk. (Common terns are slender and a little over a foot in length; seagulls are plump, range from two to four feet in length, and eat baby and juvenile terns.)
Once a tern was caught, I’d come out of hiding and reach my hand into the trap, gently gripping the fluttering bird and slipping it into a cloth bag.
We’d walk back to “basecamp,” a single-story brick building, hurrying to keep time with the daily rhythm: Hang the bags from an array of hooks; take one bag and extract the tern; record its identification number; measure its beak with a caliper; stick the tern into a paper cone sitting on a scale; measure and record its weight.
Yet there was syncopation. Some terns wouldn’t set off our traps, while others would stand next to the wire boxes, seeming to gloat at having outwitted us. They occasionally squawked and shook while dangling from the hooks, and their nipping turned my index finger raw as I measured their beaks. The cones smelled faintly like the rancid, pale goop of undigested fish that the terns were liable to vomit.
Then the release: clasp the tern’s torso once more, lower your hands to the soil, and throw your arms forward in a sunburst. Launched into the air, the tern is free from measurement and regulation, at least until next summer.
***
My scenario-planning stretches beyond conversations. I also take comfort in sketching out the contours of my day: what I’ll be doing, when, and with whom. On Great Gull, the constant chaos of trapping and tagging terns made it impossible to maintain a consistent rhythm.
Meals, in particular, were of no importance on the island. Lack of refrigeration constricted our food supply to the size of the boat making the weekly delivery. Breakfast might be pan-fried spam, and lunch something on stale bread. Dinner could be at any time between 9 and 11 p.m.
There was a tradeoff: lack of a communal meal schedule gave volunteers autonomy over their own fare. And with that control came danger.
Body image has weighed on me since middle school. I had always been the unathletic friend; the slightly larger one; the one who ate the last slice of pizza. Casual teasing compounded into shame.
On an island where the only certainty was waking up at 5 a.m. to trap birds, and everyone was a stranger I struggled to connect with, all of my projections failed. I began to think irrationally: life here is chaotic and miserable; I’m miserable because I’m lonely; I’m lonely because other people aren’t talking to me; they aren’t talking to me because of my unseemly physique. Thus, controlling my meals and body would grant me mastery over each day’s events.
With no structured lunch on the island, I chose not to eat. Or maybe I’d have a half-can of Campbell’s Chunky Beef With Country Vegetables Soup (145 calories). I’d refuse seconds at dinner, and I might not even finish my first, tiny portion. I lost 10 pounds in 10 days.
***
The most chaotic hours on Great Gull were from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., when we scoured the island for newly-born chicks — tan fluff balls with umber spots and white underbellies — upon which to clip metal ID bands, which would help track the terns over their decade-long lifespans. Our paths mutated daily, sending us through dense underbrush replete with hidden nests and fleeing juvenile terns.
These were also the most essential hours, allowing the study to tease bits of order from the daily entropy for five decades.
For instance, common terns not only mate for life, but tend to nest in the same location each year. Now the study’s architects want to see, among other things, whether any of a mating pairs’ children return to the same nest — to discover for how many generational cycles the rhythm runs its course.
***
Burning, tingling, grating sensations spread from my gut to my fingertips. Nearly collapsing in the noon sun, I reveled in knowing that sheer will was keeping my legs moving; my mind had total control over my body.
The worst part of the chick-tagging excursions was the smell — musty, moldy, noxious, like curdled milk and ripening compost — that signalled the presence of a dead chick, a victim of the sun.
Burning, tingling, sagging, I stooped down and dug a small crater in the crumbling soil, transferring a limp frame beneath the earth. The effort of rising sent hunger rippling through my own.
***
Getting from Great Gull Island to Brooklyn requires one hour of travel by boat and several hours by car. Donna offered to drive me. In return, my parents would provide her with a home-cooked lunch.
I had already planned my homecoming: hug my parents and sister, eat a delicious meal, take my first shower in two weeks, and spend hours recounting my time away. Donna did not feature in these plans, so I tried to reason her away. Maybe I’d misheard and she wouldn’t be eating with us, or maybe my parents would just recommend a nearby restaurant.
I began the morning by refusing breakfast in order to save calories for lunch. After the boat landed in Connecticut, Donna had to drive several boxes brought over from the island to a far-off storage facility. Then I misread a sign and we took I-287 instead of I-278.
Donna tried to talk with me while she drove. Hungry, and irritated because we were several hours late, I hardly responded.
My father had cooked ribs and a variety of vegetables. We arrived around 3 p.m., meaning my parents and sister had already eaten; after two weeks of not seeing my family, my first hour at home would consist of lunch with a fifty-year old woman I would never meet again. Instead, I went to upstairs under the guise of wanting to shower and refused to go back down.
I was not thinking about how generous Donna had been or my disrespectful actions. I just sat on my bed, suppressing wet, briny intransigence and hoping Donna would leave so that I could at least eat in the private, comforting presence of my family.
When my parents called me down to tell Donna goodbye, I shouted no, my voice raspy and grating after crying for 30 minutes. When the front door clicked shut, I crept downstairs. My parents did not look at or speak with me. My father stormed into his office and slammed the door. The food was tepid, and I ate alone.
Only then did I imagine Donna’s indignation: “I offer to drive him and he won’t even talk to me?” I pictured my parents’ embarrassment: “Sorry, he usually isn’t like this. We hope you aren’t offended.”
I realized how counterintuitive my scenario-planning had been: Starving myself made me miserable on the island; fearing conversation kept me from making friends; skipping breakfast made me irritable in the car and is probably why we ended up on the wrong highway; choosing to hide in my room ruined my return.
***
A few times during each evening on Great Gull, the squawking dissolves into silence. Terns rise from the shore and fly over the water in a simultaneous but unsynchronized motion known as a “dread.” The phenomenon is breathtaking: Hundreds of grey wings, not quite in rhythm, beat against a hazy, pink and yellow sunset; rippling waves below reflect their own, darker version of the scene. And scientists aren’t entirely sure why, nor can they predict when, a dread will occur.

The Charlestown Navy Yard stands still on a frigid March morning. Heavy snow swallows the wheels of parked cars and muffles the footsteps of a few workmen trudging along in Carhartt outerwear. Rusted cranes loom over the yard like arcade claws –– they seem to have been waiting hundreds of years to snatch up cargo. Docked in the waters beneath them is the USS Constitution, a proud, wooden-hulled battleship preserved since the 19th century, when it became known as “Old Ironsides” during the War of 1812.
Past the ship and across the Charles River stand TD Garden, various skyscrapers, and modern, functional cranes that build the city up so it can stare down on its past. The Charlestown Navy Yard defies these surroundings, this era, and even time itself. In a city full of movement toward the modern, the yard is a sanctuary of brick, wood, and rusty steel.
This anachronism serves as a perfect home for the USS Constitution Model Shipwright Guild, whose 90-or-so members gather on the first Tuesday of each month at the USS Constitution Museum. At the meetings, model ship-makers — labelled either apprentices, journeymen, or masters — show-and-tell their projects, which have consumed immeasurable amounts of their time, energy, and resources. Members are professionals and hobbyists alike, and they come from as far as Argentina and Germany. Transcending career and geography, members are unified by their graying hair and love of a dying art. Sometimes, the Guild features guest speakers; other times, it holds a fundraising auction among its members. This year, the Guild is celebrating its 40th anniversary with “Masters of Miniature: the 40th Annual Model Ship Show,” open to the public until March 23 at the USS Constitution Museum.


The show invites the average, non-ship-making-connoisseur into the world of the Model Shipwright Guild. Dozens of scaled-down ships are regally displayed with their sails unfurled in one of the museum’s rooms. They range from modest ship-in-a-bottle creations to imposing vessels that swallow an entire table. Every model is immaculately detailed and exhaustively researched. Modelers often find original plans for the vessels they imitate, meaning every miniscule cannon, railing, and dinghy likely has a supersized twin at sea, or once did. Guildsmen flit between the models, hovering over them affectionately and offering their abundant knowledge to visitors.
The majority are copies of historically significant ships, with only a few modern designs making an appearance. “Modern ships don’t look very nice,” says guildsman Mat J. Leupold, age 94, of Wayland, Mass. “The warships don’t look like ships. The cruise liners don’t look like ships. The ocean liners are extinct. The shapely vessels have to be from a long ways back.” To build models is to reminisce about history as much as it is to preserve it.
Glenn A. Kalimon, who has been a guild member for the past nine years and was recently named a master, has three ships of his own at the show. One of them is the Helen B. Thomas, a fishing schooner unique for its lack of a “bowsprit,” or the traditional stick jutting out from the front of the boat. Another is a stone sloop, specially designed to haul granite blocks; the third is a yacht owned by a personal friend. He explains that when choosing his models, he looks for something unique. “And it’s got to be something I can fall in love with,” he says.
Love is a necessary criterion for model ship building, considering the arduous, intensive process required. Love — a lot of it — is the driving motivation of these loyal hobbyists.


Larry A. Ward, age 78, of Scituate, Mass., can attest to that. He spent a year building his model of the Steel Traveler, a cargo ship on which he himself served as chief engineer during the Vietnam War. The model is beautiful and exact; when asked how big the real Steel Traveler is, Ward responds without hesitation: “498 feet long.”
Ward’s masterwork is a model of the USS Constitution itself, which boasts fully functional rigging and 30,000 tiny copper plates on its hull. The White House wanted to display it in the Navy Mess restaurant, an immeasurable honor to be sure. But Ward wasn’t ready to hand over his labor of love. His idea: “How ‘bout I loan it to them?”
He took it back after just two years. “It’s a little piece of me,” he explains.
When you exit the museum, the hulking, real-life USS Constitution itself floats before you. It looks exactly like Ward’s.

When I enter the room for the first time, the only sound is my own slightly elevated breathing. I have trekked four flights up the Sever South stairway to find myself in a dimly lit, scarcely populated space where little moves except for the privileged few who are already there. They are not privileged because of any personal achievement or institutionally granted advantage; no, they are privileged simply because they know this place exists.
I am standing in the belly of Harvard’s best kept non-secret: the Film Studies Library.
The library is part of the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies, but it is not situated in the Carpenter Center for Visual Arts. It lives on Sever’s fourth floor, where it maintains a non-circulating collection of DVDs, CDs, books, PS-4 games, and periodicals — none of which have been digitized.
I walk into the library at 2:53 pm, 53 minutes after it opens, and look around. Brightly illuminated to my left are a large desk, a wall of movies protected by plastic sliding doors, and a cream-colored table where a student sits. He is also dressed in cream.
To my right, the rest of the room is incongruently dim, though this is probably because only one light is functional. There is a set of two back-to-back black leather (or pleather?) couches, two more black leather (pleather?) chairs in a strangely rounded corner, and a number of black bookshelves. I sit in one of the two chairs, a vantage point that allows me to survey the entirety of the library. I’ve decided that all the seating is pleather.
I’ve been emailing Colin S. Smith, the library coordinator for the Film Studies Library, and he soon approaches me. I’m not hard to find, considering I’m the only student in the library besides the guy in the cream sweater, who Smith later informs me works for the library.
Smith describes the library as a non-circulating collection primarily supporting the VES program. The majority of the resources in the library are unavailable in other spaces on campus, and most were acquired after being specifically requested by faculty who needed them for a specific course.
The VES department hires students to staff the library, and there’s only one requirement: They can’t be colorblind because the library organizes its reserve film section by color-coordinated stickers.
I asked roughly 10 students about the Film Studies Library, and not one was unaware of its location. Even the most technologically savvy students have to visit in person to access its resources, as its collection is not catalogued on HOLLIS.
When Smith insists I see the viewing area, I imagine an IMAX theater hidden in the back corner of Sever. Instead, I find a long, thin tunnel with white walls where two full-size VHS players — the kind that elementary school teachers used to wheel into the classroom — rest like gentle giants on a white counter. The other six devices on the counter are a mix of similarly ancient forms of entertainment consumption technology: CD players, DVD players, and two PS-4s.
So what kind of a space is this library supposed to occupy in a campus full of students who have no idea it exists?
Smith sees the library’s collection as reflective of its individuality. “We’ve built an extremely idiosyncratic collection and there’s a lot of stuff that’s just not available anywhere else,” he says.
Looking to the future, Smith says that he wouldn’t rule out uploading the library’s resources to HOLLIS. For a moment, it feels like the acquiescence of an ancient force to the overwhelming flow of modernity: To digitize the collection would be to irrevocably alter the necessary experience of viewing these materials in person. Smith quickly eases my fears: “At the moment, as a non-circulating collection, people have to come to us to view stuff… it seems to kind of work.”
After our interview, I stay in the library to study, sitting on one of the pleather couches for so long I convince myself that I can hear the air being pumped into and out of the room. I am the only non-employee in the space the entire time.
Sitting among VHS players, DVDs, and silence, rapidly typing on my computer, I feel a little bit out of place. But maybe we all need a little more of this in our lives: a space in which, among a world of Google Calendar, Netflix, and frenzied rushing from one activity to the next, time seems to pause.
When I leave at 5:16 p.m., the loudest noise I’ve heard in the past two-plus hours is the sound of our interview, a welcome change from the chatter of Sever’s crowded halls.

Alexis M. Mealey ’21 is skeptical of labels. Political labels, that is, like “Republican” or “Democrat.” Mealey’s personal beliefs, she says, do not fit neatly into the platforms of either party. Though she is the president of Harvard’s chapter of the Network of Enlightened Women, an organization for conservative women, she is pro-choice and passionate about prison reform.
“I think the state of U.S. prisons is repulsive,” she says, “and I would have loved to work with the College Dems on an initiative to handle that, but I don’t really fit the Democratic model, especially being a former Republican.”
This dissatisfaction with partisan politics led Mealey, along with her two co-founders Sarah B. Gill ’21 and Samantha J. Frenkel-Popell ’21, to found the Harvard Undergraduate Centrist Society. The organization had its first introductory meeting last month.
“I’ve been thinking about this since the Visitas debate,” Mealey says, referring to the annual debate between the Harvard College Democrats and the Harvard Republican Club during the College’s accepted students weekend . Both Mealey and Gill attended the debate, and both left feeling disappointed.
“At one point, they were talking about the environment,” Gill recalls, “and the College Republicans very clearly said, ‘We know this isn’t something that a lot of Republicans say… but yeah, we believe in climate change. Climate change is real.’ And one thing that discouraged me was that the Democrats were like, ‘Well then, you’re not a Republican.’ People aren’t really willing to compromise or talk about the issues. It’s more about the name you put on yourself with a political party.”
Gill ultimately joined the College Democrats, and Mealey joined the Republican Club, but both felt that these labels impeded “actually discussing issues in any kind of meaningful way,” Mealey says.
Frenkel-Popell, the Centrist Society’s other cofounder, worked extensively with independent movements and campaigns during her gap year. She says she also felt frustrated when it came to having productive political discussions.
“In the [political] climate today,” she says, “everything is so polarized, and it just feels so personal and emotional that it can be very hard to have a rational argument. It’s very hard to beat someone’s emotional argument with rational facts.”
The founders want the Centrist Society to be more than just a space for debate, however. The organization plans to adopt a legislative agenda each semester, focusing on one issue with the potential of expanding it to the next semester as well. “We’ll select [the issue] as an organization at the beginning of the semester and work from there,” Mealey explains. “That will include researching policy solutions, creating bipartisan policy proposal, and then bringing them to whatever relevant bodies exist.” This semester’s agenda has not yet been chosen.
Though the organization says its board members are evenly split between the center-left and center-right, they are not looking for a club comprised solely of political moderates, making “Centrist Society” seem almost like a misnomer. “We want Communists, we want anarchists, we want them all,” Mealey says. “It’s just about coming with a willingness to listen. That’s all we want people to do.”
Mealey believes that no particular political stances should be explicitly off-limits, though she does set some conditions. “If you’re invalidating someone’s identity by your political opinion, then yeah, it’s probably wrong, but we want an entire range of respectful opinions, no matter how far on the spectrum they fall,” she says.
When asked what differentiates a “respectful” opinion from an “invalidating” one, Mealey explains that it all comes down to intention. “We want people who are coming with political opinions that are grounded in fact and aren’t grounded in some kind of abject hatred that has no place on campus,” she says. “We don’t necessarily want to exclude anyone’s political beliefs by creating an oppressive environment for speech.”
Mealey is also the president of the Harvard College Open Campus Initiative, a pro-free speech organization known for inviting controversial speakers such as Charles Murray to campus. “My decision to join OCI was totally separate from my decision to start [the Centrist Society],” Mealey says, but she adds that the two groups address what she calls “a common theme” at Harvard: “We are very, very hostile to people’s opinions, even when we haven’t necessarily heard all of them.”
“That’s not to say we’re not working to reinvigorate the center. We’re doing work with independent movements and center-right, center-left movements and various campaign reform groups, because we find that really important,” Frenkel-Popell adds.
Within Harvard, student reactions to the Centrist Society seem to be largely positive. “We are very excited to see more political engagement on campus. We will continue our focus on progressive political activism, but we always welcome new ideas on campus,” says Riley E. Hoveland ’22, the communications director of the Harvard College Democrats.
Victoria M. Marquez ’20, the president of the Harvard Republican Club, feels similarly. “I support the mission of bringing together people of different ideologies to try and work together and find bipartisan solutions,” she says.
Some students, like Molly C. Nolan ’19, expressed doubts about the Centrist Society’s vision, which includes bringing together everyone from Trump supporters to Bernie fans. “I think that’s very idealistic,” she says. Though Nolan thinks bipartisanship is “a very good, very important thing,” her perspective is shaped by her understanding of politics in her home country of the United Kingdom.
“I identify as being center-left in the UK,” she says. “Our left-wing party and our right-wing party, they both split and formed a center group with politicians that ultimately don’t have that much in common... It’s a very rocky foundation.”
But Gill notes that the Centrist Society is gaining traction outside of Harvard. “Salve Regina, which is a school in Rhode Island, just asked us for our Constitution, because they are looking to make similar clubs,” she says. “So we’re just hoping that this kind of mentality of collaboration and going across the aisle spreads, because there needs to be a change in politics.”

Shortly after midnight on Oct. 14, 1970, an explosion ripped through the third floor of the Harvard Semitic Museum, just north of Harvard Yard. It left several offices demolished — but beyond its physical destruction, it also gave rise to an ever-changing mythology about the museum.
A few hours earlier, activists protesting America’s continued involvement in the Vietnam War had placed a bomb in an office on the third floor, timed to detonate when the building was empty. They had targeted the third floor of the Harvard Semitic Museum — then home to Harvard’s Center for International Affairs — because it had once contained the office of Henry Kissinger ’50 during his time as a professor. However, by the time the bomb was placed October 1970, Kissinger had long since relocated to Washington, D.C., to serve as President Richard Nixon’s National Security Advisor.
The bomb’s explosion caused major structural damage to the upper floors of the Semitic Museum, toppling bookshelves, blowing out windows, and causing part of the attic’s floor to collapse. Two offices were completely destroyed and a third was damaged. At the time, a Harvard spokesperson estimated that the cost of the damage was below $40,000. The Boston Globe later reported a figure closer to $20,000.
Following the bombing, both the Cambridge Police Department and the Harvard University Police Department conducted investigations. The next day, an anti-war activist group called the Proud Eagle Tribe stepped forward to claim responsibility, sending a letter postmarked from Cambridge to various news organizations in the Boston area. According to the letter, published in The Crimson on Oct. 15, 1970, the bombing was the first action of a “fall offensive … from Cambridge Commons to the ‘I’ Labs of M.I.T.”
The group described itself as a tribe of “revolutionary women” in the letter, and said its mission was to attack “the enemy every-where he shows his ugly face.” The bombing was the culmination of a series of conflicts between the CFIA and students in 1969 and 1970. The Proud Eagle Tribe said the CFIA researched “new ways for the Pig Nixon to try to destroy people’s wars in Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East” and produced “toads like Henry Kissinger, who left the Center to join Nixon's death machine.”
Cambridge police looked for two female suspects who were seen entering the museum on the day of the bombing, but they were never apprehended. In the end, despite involvement by the FBI, the investigations were unable to discover the true identities of the perpetrators. A few weeks after the incident, the feminist magazine Off Our Backs reprinted the Proud Eagle Tribe’s letter.
“Police are presently seeking two unidentified women in connection with the bombing,” the magazine wrote in an introductory note to the letter’s text. “Nobody knows if they are members of the Proud Eagle Tribe — or indeed if the Tribe really exists.”
The immediate impact of the bombing was minimal. It was condemned by student activist groups on campus. Harvard President Nathan M. Pusey ’28 was eager to move on, stating that he was, “confident the entire University will draw together in pursuing its work, sobered, thankful there was no loss of life.” Despite the high-profile nature of the bombing, the CFIA did not leave the Semitic Museum until 1978.
That seems a likely end to the story of the Harvard Semitic Museum bombing. It wasn’t.
As the museum’s current deputy director and curator, Joseph A. Greene, notes, “the more interesting story here is the story of the story, not the story itself.” In the decades since the bombing of the Harvard Semitic Museum, the specifics have faded. “The facts about the event itself … get a bit lost in all the mythology,” Greene says. “That’s what I mean about the story of the story.”
​​​​​​
A key part of that “story of the story” involves the so-called Bonfils photographs, a collection of images of the Middle East that formed part of the Semitic Museum’s original exhibit in the late 19th century. Museum lore says the explosion uncovered tea crates filled with some 28,000 photographs, negatives, and other photographic materials stored in the attic. Supposedly, they had been forgotten for almost 90 years.
According to the myth, when investigators and museum staff cleared the debris and began repairs, they found a treasure trove of large black and white photographs of people and locations in the Middle East. Produced by Maison Bonfils, a printing house in Beirut, Lebanon, the photographs were widely distributed in Europe and North America to provide Western audiences with a glimpse into life and culture in the Middle East. Following their ‘rediscovery,’ the photographs became notable for the insight they provided into how the Semitic Museum had historically treated the region. Curators at the museum hurried to incorporate them into a new photographic archive in an effort to revitalize the museum, and the photographs remained on exhibit until the 1990s.
However, this version of the story is up for debate.
According to Greene, there was no great moment of discovery, no forgotten trove of photographs, and no excited rush to develop a new exhibit. Instead, most of the photographs had been catalogued and stored in the museum basement, and their number was far below 28,000 at the time of the bombing. Moreover, the exhibit, while real, opened almost a decade after the bombing, in the early 1980s. But these facts were lost in an effort to generate excitement for the photographs before the opening of the exhibit.
“It’s a bit like the oral traditions of the Bible,” Greene says. “It’s a good story, and maybe there is some physical evidence for it, but it’s very hard to draw straight lines from the physical evidence to the event.”
The story of the bombing has continued to evolve over the years. In a 1993 op-ed for The Crimson, Social Studies lecturer Martin Peretz wrote, “Found in the rubble of virtuous indignation was one of the world's largest collections of early Middle Eastern photographs, a treasure in its way as great as the archaeology and ethnographic materials which first gave the museum its reputation.”
The academic Barclay G. Jones used the example of the bombing of the CFIA in a 1986 book to show how disasters can sometimes reveal “forgotten cultural elements.” Citing the former curator of the Semitic Museum, Carney E. S. Gavin, Jones wrote that the bombing revealed, “the largest collection in the world of nineteenth century views of the Middle East, an enormously valuable historic record.” Greene suggests that even those who were alive at the time of the bombing have since absorbed the myth surrounding it — as Jones’s text demonstrates.
The story has also provided invaluable material for students looking for a topic for a term-paper or inspiration a for a thesis. In the past few years alone, several Harvard affiliates have approached Greene in hopes of finding out more about the Semitic Museum bombing.
“It recycles,” Greene says. “It is embedded in some of these articles that people read and believe, and it won’t go away.”
“In a couple years, another undergrad will approach and say, ‘Well, what about this bombing?’” And so the story of the story will start once again.

The presence of Marshall L. Ganz ’64-’92 at Harvard is largely defined by his time away. Even today, Ganz is flying from Boston to Parkland, Fla. to conduct a workshop about community organizing strategies. This is the sort of work that Ganz has been doing his whole life — a life that has blurred the bounds of people and place, and a life that has centered around active civic engagement and scholarship.
Ganz matriculated to the College in the fall of 1960 and received his A.B. as part of the class of ’92 following a 28-year leave of absence in between. After his undergraduate degree, Ganz obtained an M.P.A at the Kennedy School in 1993 and a Sociology Ph.D. from the Graduate School of Arts and Science in 2000. Ganz is now a Rita E. Hauser Senior Lecturer in Leadership, Organizing, and Civil Society at the Kennedy School.
Ganz’s research at Harvard focuses on organization and leadership in social movements and politics. This is the focus of the imminent Parkland workshop that he is about to lead. But Ganz’s approach to organization is not an institutional one — it is firmly focused on action and individuals on the ground. “It’s values-based and that means we start with narratives, why people were being called, what they share with their communities,” he says.
In the same way, Ganz’s own life also revolves around work that needs to be done in the present moment. About social movements, he asks, “If I share their values, then why, why am I not doing it?”
Ganz grew up in Bakersfield, Calif. and came to Harvard thinking he wanted to study Government. But between his sophomore and junior years, Ganz decided to take a year off and spent time in Berkeley, Calif. working at an insurance company and taking classes at the University of California, Berkeley.
Ganz recalls that, in his day, taking time off from Harvard was significantly more rare. “I feel like it was an oddity — it wasn't that common,” he says. “I felt like I needed to do that in order to catch my breath.” His time away from Cambridge helped him realize that he didn’t want to study Government as he had originally anticipated, and he pivoted instead to History and Literature.
When Ganz returned to Harvard, he was immediately drawn back to the world beyond it. Interactions with roommates connected him to emerging social movements. One of his roommates worked with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, a civil rights movement era organization dedicated to nonviolent organizing. Through SNCC, Ganz spent the summer after his junior year working with the Mississippi Summer Project, a 1964 voter registration effort aimed at increasing turnout of black voters in Mississippi.
Then, one summer away from Harvard turned into 27 years. “I went to Mississippi, I just thought I was doing it for the summer, but you know, it turned into another year,” he says. “There never came to be a compelling enough reason to come back… until there was.”
“I wrote Harvard a letter: how can I come back and study history when I'm busy making it?” Ganz says.
Ganz found his experience in organizing to be as important to his education as his time at Harvard. “I really discovered that my education on race and power and politics started there, not at Harvard,” he says, referencing his time in Mississippi. This inspired him to continue working on grassroots organizing in the state, including advocating for civil rights legislation.
After a year in Mississippi, Ganz moved to California. He spent 16 years helping to organize agricultural workers as a member of the United Farm Workers Association. After this, Ganz spent 10 years in electoral and union work. He organized and led strategy for Democratic political campaigns and for unions.
It was at the 25th reunion for his social graduating class that Ganz decided to come back to Harvard.
“It was sort of like running into a 20-year-old version of me that was asking me, how's it going?” he recalls. “I was really kind of stuck in terms of the work I've been doing all that time — so 20- year- old me said, ‘why don't you come back and finish that senior year?’” Ganz says.
He came back to Harvard in 1991 and resumed the learning that he had started outside of the classroom. “It was kind of cool to be in a small seminar with Michael Sandel and 18 undergraduates and enjoy the cross-generational context of the learning as well as the content,” he says.
Ganz’s experiences with both hands-on and classroom learning shape his pedagogy today. He believes that students need “a context in which people actually have the opportunities to try things, to learn from them.”For Ganz, these opportunities to learn are realized upon returning to a distinct place, Harvard or his hometown. Today, after three decades of on-the-ground organizing, he strengthens his commitment to those communities by staying at Harvard.
Ganz continues to hold organizing workshops across the world and still believes firsthand experience is important to social activism. But he also thinks his work at Harvard helps him achieve that.
“It turned out to be a way I could integrate my life experience and social science in a pedagogical conversation with a rising generation,” he says of his work at Harvard. “I realized that really I was doing work very similar to the work I was doing in Mississippi, in the sense that it was about engaging with people and enabling them to find their own sources of correlate, calling their own sources and how to take advantage of the world and make a difference.”
Correction: April 6, 2019
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated Ganz's class year as '64-'93. In fact, his class year is '64-'92.
Correction: April 6, 2019
A previous version of this article misquoted Ganz as saying his work enables people to find their own sources of "correlate, calling their own sources and how to take advantage of the world and make a difference." In fact, Ganz said, his work enables people to find their own sources of "calling, and how to take that to the world and make a difference.”

Before Michael H. Brown '83-'84 and Alan A. Khazei '83 founded the education non-profit City Year, which supports students at risk nationwide, they were just two students among hundreds enrolled in one of the most popular classes at Harvard during the 1980s and 1990s.
The course was General Education 105: “Literature of Social Reflection,” taught by the magnetic Dr. Robert M. Coles ‘50. Coles connected literature with social activism through the works of authors like William Carlos Williams, Flannery O’Connor, Raymond Carver, and Charles Dickens. Through the practice of reading, he encouraged students to step outside of their own perspectives and consider the plights of others.
For Brown and Khazei, who were roommates at the time, City Year began with passionate, late-night conversations about public service —conversations inspired by Coles’ lectures.
Coles, a prominent child psychiatrist, social theorist, and Pulitzer Prize-winning author, stopped teaching the class in 2001 and retired not long after. A literature class as large as his, which saw enrollment numbers as high as 850, hasn’t existed at Harvard since. Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science,” Harvard’s most popular class last fall, has now claimed that cult-like reputation.
Harvard has experienced a recent decline in English and humanities concentrators, a trend mirrored nationwide. So what made this particular literature class such a staple of the course catalog, some thirty years ago? And what might its absence suggest about the changing nature of literature classes on campus?
While students flocked to the course for Coles’ inspiring lectures, they were also certainly attracted to his leniency: he was “not interested in grades, or tests, or requirements, or any of that piddling stuff that other professors seem to get off on,” reports the satirical, Crimson-produced “Confidential Guide” of 1988.
English Department Director of Undergraduate Studies Stephanie L. Burt ’94 — who shopped the class as an undergraduate — emphasizes that large lectures, while advantageous in some cases, may not be the best prototype for the humanities at Harvard in 2019.
“We are aware of the success that Robert Coles’ class had in the 80s, and we are committed to teaching that looks at questions of social justice and inclusion, but I don't think that that course is a good direct model for Harvard College 2019,” she says.
This is partly because of what she views as a shift in the role of lecture classes in an age of lecture recordings and flipped-classroom teaching, an approach driven by greater instructor interaction.
“Students are more likely to want some other kind of experience than being in the largest possible room, to see the most charismatic speaker,” she says. “My focus and my interest has been on more professor-student interaction, rather than on trying to build up lecture classes that are as large as we can make them.” For example, the department recently expanded its Creative Writing program to meet the high student demand for small workshop classes.
Other concerns with Coles’ class model center on its content. Former students like Gloria M. Custodio ‘91 felt that the lectures and reading list were “geared towards an audience of middle-to-upper class whites who have fairly similar experiences within a limited variety of backgrounds,” as she wrote in a Crimson editorial in 1989. “I have found superficial discussions of poverty and the class system, and near-complete exclusion of gender or ethnicity.”
Coles, now age 89, did not respond to a request to be interviewed for this article, but he responded to Custodio’s editorial in a Boston Globe interview published the same year.
“I see what she’s trying to say. It’s hard to direct a course to all the different people in it. But she didn’t mention that I teach women writers such as George Eliot and Dorothy Day, and black writers such as James McPherson,” he said. (Custodio did, in fact, address what she considered to be a mere “ smattering of women and minorities” on the course’s reading list.)
Burt feels that “you could design a course with the same goals [of social reflection] in 2019 and quite easily set it up so that there's not one dominant perspective among most of the authors,” she says.
She points to Professor John W. Stauffer’s lecture class English 175D: “The Rhetoric of Frederick Douglass and Abraham Lincoln” as an example of such a course. Stauffer states that Coles’ class served as inspiration for his own teaching.
“[Coles] was interested in the way in which literature can function as a catalyst for social change in the largest sense,” he says. “That's precisely what [my] course [does].”
The spirit of “Literature of Social Reflection” still exists, in an evolved form, on campus — albeit in smaller classrooms. Like other literature courses today, Stauffer’s class doesn’t sees the enrollment Coles’ did.
Looking back at course popularity is “a wonderful way to understand how and why students… choose Harvard,” Stauffer says. “[It’s] not just to get a great education, but to get a great education that will be marketable, and let’s face it, computer science is a lot more marketable than English right now.”
These financial pressures are a partial explanation for the decline in the number of English concentrators at Harvard and nationwide, but Burt doesn’t believe that offering a course that exposes 850 students to literature each fall would suddenly alter that trend.
“We would love to have more concentrators,” she says. “We spend a lot of time thinking about... how to be inviting, while still making clear that this is a discipline, that this is a scholarly activity, and not only a book club.”
Snow X. Dong ’19, who researched Coles’ class as part of a sociology project on civic engagement classes at Harvard, offered a similar reflection. “I can imagine that once a class gets that big, it would be difficult to ensure the quality of your discussions,” she says. “We all have a general idea of what those classes look like — big Gen Ed classes that are known to be easy, even if the topics are supposedly interesting.”
Yet sometimes those classes leave unexpectedly deep legacies, whether with the founders of City Year, or with Custodio, the writer of the 1989 Crimson editorial criticizing Coles’ class.
Custodio, now a 10th grade English and journalism teacher, has borrowed works from Coles’ syllabus for her own class.
“The Raymond Carver short stories have stuck with me. Tillie Olsen, ‘I Stand Here Ironing’ has stuck with me. ‘The Moviegoer’ by [Walker] Percy, and ‘Let Us Now Praise Famous Men,’ and ‘Invisible Man,’” she recalls.
Though she says she stands by her prior criticism, she emphasizes that she was — and remains — a proponent of Coles’ focus on empathy, even if she felt his approach was imperfect.
“In the historical moment that we're living in now,” she says, “this type of course is actually more necessary than it was then.”
As Dong says, “There’s something to be said about having that [type of course] on campus — what it does to unconsciously impact students. It still says something to you.”

Terry G. Ni ’20-’21 gestures proudly towards the weathered road sign at the intersection. On it, stamped underneath an arrow that points backwards in the direction that we walked from are the words “Harvard Square.” We’ve made it to the final destination of our Saturday morning walk.
“It makes you feel like you've come a long way,” she says.
The group is just 1.9 miles from Harvard’s campus, yet the landscape on the far side of Danehy Park is an unfamiliar expanse of asphalt dotted with parked cars. Lining its border are a discount movie theater, a mall, and a mysterious establishment with a presumptuous billboard labeled “Black Magic Chimney and Fireplace.”
This feeling — one of local novelty — is the aim of the Harvard Walking Association.
The Harvard walkers congregate on Saturday morning inside the Malkin Athletic Center, awaited by their founder, Ni, and treasurer, Luann M. Zerefa ’21. Ni explains their vision, different from that of many other student groups — there is no application, no tryout, no set time commitment.“We want to create a club where people can gather together to exercise,” she says. “There's no comp process — everyone can come whenever.”
But only a few decide to take advantage of this respite. Ni later tells me that walks usually consist of three to five people, each walk featuring a different cast. On this sunny Saturday morning, with midterms approaching, it seems that no one else will venture out to join us.
The three of us set out on our route. Today, our journey will take us to the outskirts of Cambridge, just beyond Danehy Park, and past the historic Longfellow House on the way back.
Each week, Ni carefully chooses landmarks to see and charts the club’s routes using Google Maps. She emails out the itinerary beforehand to members, who often come based on their interest in the destinations. Ni tells me that one of their drop-in participants joined a walk to Central Square so he could have company on his way to work. Another one-time walker was an employee from the Smith Campus Center. Ni enjoys this cycle of company.
“A good thing about walking club is that it’s really nice to meet other people who just like walking around,” she says. This has been a longtime interest for Ni herself. “In high school,” she tells me, “I used to walk every day to a new place in Boston.” She enjoyed rediscovering her own city as a sightseer, appreciating quintessentially “tourist-y” places like Faneuil Hall and Quincy Market.
But exploring typical Greater Boston haunts isn’t the only goal of the club. Zerefa is a newly minted “walking person,” having grown up in a part of Arizona where “by fifteen, everyone starts driving,” she says. Ni makes note of Zerefa’s approach to her newfound hobby: “See, Luann is super good at pointing out interesting things that we happen to come by.”
Zerefa takes a special pleasure in discovering the unusual amid the ordinary. When asked for her favorite walk-discovery, she replies, “I found out that there’s a Business School chapel with a koi pond.”
“This is what we do,” Ni says. “Look for weird local stuff.”
A few streets later, we stumble upon today’s opportunity to fulfill the Harvard Walking Association’s mission statement. In front of a yellow-shingled house stands a structure halfway between a cupboard and an oversized mailbox. Behind a tiny glass pane door, framed by white wood and a porcelain door knob, stands an eclectic array of books. This is Charter # 4407 of the Little Free Library.
“There are some pretty good books here,” Ni marvels.
“Beginning Calculus?” Zerefa replies skeptically, reading out the title of the tallest book wedged into the cubby.
“Cat Power — that sounds like something that I would take,” says Ni.
Ni explains that there are somewhere near 80,000 of these libraries in the world. Four or five are near Harvard, and one is in front of her own house in Boston.
We trek through a park with a baseball field and sledding hills to arrive at our final destination. We look at the sign, marvel at the distance traveled, then turn around and take a different route home.

I make a point not to think more than six months in advance. Usually, not more than a few days. This, of course, means making plans with me is a nightmare. I don’t always know what I want in the present moment, so how can I know what future-me wants and needs? It could change any second. The future is always in flux.
Maybe this is a Sagittarius thing. According to astrology, my birthday dictates what I do, at least to some degree. Astrology has been used as a method of divination for centuries. Based on when and where you were born, it provides the tools to assess your personality, relationships, and how lucky you are. There are 12 signs, and every person has a sign for each celestial aspect in the sky on their birthday. For instance, the moon was in Aquarius when I was born. This placement allegedly explains my habits of emotional detachment, and my interest in alien conspiracy theories.
But understanding my birth chart leaves me wondering: Is the future fixed? This thought sends me on another journey into the unknown and unseen. I’ve read stories about fortune tellers and blind seers. How do they access the future amid all this uncertainty? Crystals in hand, I seek out the skill of knowing without observing — the sixth sense. The psychics I talk to call it intuition.
To start, I contact Melissa Peil, a Boston area psychic who compares her abilities to a GPS. A proliferation of paths make themselves visible, and she serves as a guide, informing clients of what may lie ahead. The future is unstable, and as all the psychics I talked to in the past couple weeks stressed, there is no fixed timeline. Free will is at the center of divination.
Despite the somewhat hazy possibilities for psychic reading results, there is one inevitability: mortality. In that sense, there is a predetermined timeline. Life, Melissa tells me, is like a game of Candy Land, and every person eventually reaches the castle — we just arrive with varied sets of experiences. I learn from psychic reader MaryLee Trettenero of Boston Intuitive that natural talents or predispositions are factors that can adjust the way the cards are dealt. Still, it all comes down to choices.
This is where tarot comes in. MaryLee refers to it as an act of problem solving. Tarot readings use symbolic cards to elucidate different forces in an individual’s life that can then guide decision-making. MaryLee gifted me a deck — an auspicious kindness, because it’s apparently unwise to buy your own. I now have the physical tools, but do I have the perceptive abilities to look into the future? Is my mind ready?
Melissa says yes. She says intuition is like math, in a way. “We all can do it. Some of us naturally excel more than others; some of us have to study harder.”
This “studying” entails reading books, opening yourself to information, and understanding your own mind. The psychics I talk to tell me that I must acquire a robust collection of metaphysical books — that is, actual, physical books about things that are non-physical. Future-telling has a rich tradition, and it’s important to be familiar with spiritual symbols and rituals.
But to put these traditions into practice, you have to prepare your mind. MaryLee stresses the importance of meditation, which allows you to be a “blank screen” for spiritual information. She also emphasizes that journaling and focusing more broadly on mental health can bring you in tune with your own spiritual symbols. This practice of self-awareness prepares you to receive spiritual information from others, like a sort of spiritual osmosis.
The final step in honing my intuition is attention to detail. Opening my everyday awareness should strengthen my extrasensory perceptive abilities.
The whole process requires curiosity, mistakes, and vulnerability. I’m pretty good at the first two. Vulnerability has never been my strong point.
But what does spiritual knowledge look like? Is it like a movie playing in your head? Is it a voice that whispers answers in your ear? Melissa tells me it can manifest like all five senses. There’s clairvoyance, when psychics have visions of the future, but there’s also clairaudience, which manifests like sound, along with other sense analogs. Or it can manifest like pure knowing. Pure knowing, however, doesn’t come with a perceptive component. It’s intuition in its simplest form. You just know.
For me, in my messy beta test phase of intuition, psychic knowledge pops up like thoughts. I’ll think of a person, and seconds later, they will emerge from the next room. I can anticipate the next song in the shuffle with ease. Last weekend, I met someone at a party and knew which house she was in before she told me.
Maybe there is a more quantitative way we can access the future. Supercomputers have been simulating physical reactions for years, modeling weather patterns and testing parts of nuclear weapons. Quantum computers take this real world modeling to a new level. Instead of ones and zeros, they use qubits, which carry quantum information. Using microwave pulses to manipulate the quantum states of the qubits, the computer opens doors that the binary world of classical computers can’t. With the quantum law of superposition, a qubit can act like a one and a zero at the same time.
Holding multiple states in one qubit doesn’t sound too different from the GPS-like path model Melissa described to me. With intuition, every omen points to more than one possible outcome. Could it be possible for a system of intuitive signals to make up some metaphysical realm of pure possibility, almost-existing?
I travel to Quincy, Mass. to visit the Regina Russell Tea Room at MaryLee’s recommendation. From a menu of tea leaves, birth charts and aura readings, I select the tarot and crystal ball combination reading. I’ve had my palm read a few times before, but I’ve never experienced a professional psychic reading like those the Tea Room is known for.
We step into a small, curtained reading room. I say my name and birthday, touching the cards and crystal ball to give them my energy. Looking at the full spread of cards, the psychic tells me that the past two years have been a transition period in my life. I learn that a spirit has been watching over me, and that I am going to spend some time overseas. I had been planning to be in Chicago for the summer, but now, who knows?

Josephine M. Lok ’80 and Bet Har Wong ’80, Chinese Americans from Boston and freshman roommates, were finding their place on Harvard’s campus. The weekend before classes began in 1976, the two decided to attend a freshman minority student orientation banquet held in the Radcliffe Quadrangle. The menu featured tacos, ribs, and fried chicken, but Lok and Wong were unable to try any.
Upon their arrival, banquet staffers told the roommates that the University didn’t recognize Asian Americans as a minority. Lok and Wong left without making a scene. “When they said, ‘Your name isn’t on it,’ we said, ‘Okay, maybe we didn’t sign up,’” Lok recalls.
“For us it was pretty minor,” she says. “We didn’t have that whole awareness in this way we were going to have later about being Asian American and the types of things that we might be excluded from.”
Other students recognized the implications of the exclusion. Two tables of upperclassmen walked out of the banquet in fury.
Immediately after finding out about the incident, Fred W. Ho ’79 rushed to Canaday Hall to tell his sister, Florence Houn ’80, and her roommate, Renee E. Tajima-Peña ’80.
Ho was the only Asian American in attendance at most of the weekend’s minority orientation events. Jeffrey P. Howard ’69, the founder of the Efficacy Institute, which Harvard had commissioned to run the orientation, had invited Ho to observe. Howard suggested Ho write a letter to then-Dean of Students Archie C. Epps III explaining how the orientation could be valuable for Asian American students.
For the trio, who all had high school experience with civil rights organizing and Asian American studies, the exclusion illuminated the College’s current climate. Shortly after the banquet, Tajima-Peña wrote in a letter to her family, “The Harvard Administration doesn’t even recognize Asian Americans as racial minorities!”
“[I was] really mad that that happened and a little bit frightened,” Houn recalls. “This is orientation, probably the second day in from unpacking and you’re already dealing with a conflict situation.”
Houn and Tajima-Peña demanded entry shortly after Houn’s brother notified them of the situation. After a brief discussion among the banquet’s staff, Howard agreed.
At the time, Howard claimed that Harvard had not provided them with a list of incoming Asian American students. In a letter of resignation later that year, which was in part a reaction to the banquet exclusion, Peter A. Hardie ’77 alleged that Efficacy hadn’t asked for such a list.
Howard wrote in an email regarding the 1976 banquet, “Really don’t have a specific recollection. But I can tell you as a matter of principle I would’ve been opposed to turning away Asian students. Just wouldn’t have happened if I had a decision-making role.”
Yet for Houn and Tajima-Peña, the exclusion was an unforgettable moment of both pain and possibility. “I think that itself was a rallying point, to start talking to people and identifying people and getting people rallied around an issue,” Tajima-Peña says.
The issue at hand was the formation of an Asian American political identity.
“That whole incident helped us work with students to create the Asian American Association,” Houn recalls. “A part of it was getting Asians who’d never identified themselves as Asian American — they thought they were American or they thought they were Chinese or Korean or Indian — to think about this identity of Asian in America.”
As student anger brewed, a 1976 Crimson op-ed noted that Epps did not recognize Asian Americans as an oppressed group. Similarly, L. Fred Jewett ’57, then the Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid, told The Crimson in 1976 that the admissions office “feels the important criterion is whether natural applications are underrepresented.” Asian Americans were not, he continued, underrepresented in the applicant pool.
The minority student orientation banquet of 1976 can be viewed as a microcosm of the common history binding Asian Americans together — a history of exclusion and assimilation, of invisibility and protest, of being “forever foreign” and “model minority” all at once. The exclusion of Lok and Wong galvanized Asian American students at Harvard to organize — not only for recognition, but to define their existence as a cohesive whole. It was a catalyst for a still-ongoing process in which Asian Americans sought out space for conversations on campus, fought for Asian American rights at the University, and worked in coalitions of marginalized groups to make Harvard and the world more equitable places.
In 1976, an 18-year old Tajima-Peña was well aware that the University did not recognize Asian Americans as minorities. “But,” she wrote to her family, “I’m sure that’s going to change, if I could help it.”
During high school, Houn, a second-generation Chinese American, took Asian American Studies courses at the University of Massachusetts and Black Studies courses at Amherst College. She invited Frank Chin, an Asian American playwright, to speak in her English class — her teacher “was so mind-blown, he became a full convert to literature expressions of minority people,” she wrote in an email.
“Florence also arrived with the same immersion in the politics of being Asian American,” Tajima-Peña says. “I thought it was great to have a roommate like that.”
Tajima-Peña, a Japanese American, grew up in Los Angeles, a hub of the Asian American movement. Her first school walkout, she recalls, was in elementary school. In high school, she was heavily involved with the Little Tokyo People’s Rights Organization.
Houn remembers facing racial slurs and being ridiculed for bringing dumplings to school. Her older brother, Fred Ho, was attacked by drunken sailors who called him a “g---,” at Boston Harbor during his freshman year.
“I experienced things that made it easy for me to see that when Bet Har and Josephine were excluded that that wasn’t a right thing,” Houn says.
Hoping to educate their peers, and galvanized by the minority banquet exclusion, students including Houn and Tajima-Peña formed Harvard’s Asian American Association in the fall of 1976, following the work of the Coalition of Asian American Students (established in 1974). The AAA still exists today.
“There was a concerted effort by activist students to help raise the consciousness of others,” Houn says. “A lot of it was coming of age for people, young people that wanted to view things differently or wanted to have a chance to explore their Asian Americanness — not being American and not being Chinese, Chinese.”
On Jan. 6, 1966, only 10 years earlier, a New York Times article describing Japanese American economic success coined the term “model minority.” In contrast to “problem” minorities, “model minorities” worked hard and assimilated into white America to overcome their oppression.
In 1968, Yuji Ichioka coined the term “Asian American” — a radical political act at the time. The concept of Asian American intended to break down the model minority myth, uniting formerly divided ethnic groups and placing egalitarian demands on institutions.
The zeitgeist of college campuses in the 1970s was militant and revolutionary: in 1968, the Third World Liberation Front, a coalition of African, Latinx, Asian, and Native American students, protested at San Francisco State University, making the first-ever demand for an Ethnic Studies curriculum. That same year, black students at Harvard demanded improved treatment of black students and faculty, as well as a “black curriculum.” Both of these battles against university authority were, to some extent, successful.
Asian Americans at Harvard in the 1970s had plenty to fight for. Recognition as minorities, an Asian American Studies department, and divestment from companies profiting from apartheid were the most visible issues, but the AAA was also trying to transform campus on a cultural level. In 1980, the Harvard Committee on Race Relations published “A Study of Race Relations at Harvard College.” In the study, 72 percent of Asian American students reported being treated differently “some,” “most,” or “all of the time” by their white peers; 43 percent said the same of faculty.
“We were trying to build, and this was all over the United States, an Asian American identity so that we would be empowered to determine our destiny and define ourselves,” Tajima-Peña says. “This was to determine our destiny in every facet of life: in jobs, in housing, in education, in cultural production, in everything, because we were marginalized.”
Fred Ho, who died in 2014, also played a major role in the creation of the AAA. He was largely responsible for bringing together the Asian American students who would form the organization.
Ho had also been organizing since high school, when he “was hit with the tidal wave of Black Power and the Black Arts movement,” as he told The Crimson in 2009. In college, Ho “was pretty unhappy except for when I was organizing and challenging the dominant ideology,” as he said in a 2009 Crimson Arts interview. At the College, he organized for labor rights for Chinatown restaurant workers and Harvard workers, and became involved in the international struggle against apartheid.
Hours after the banquet exclusion, Ho gave a speech at a minority orientation panel in which he lambasted the University’s treatment of minorities, calling on students to join a struggle against “any attack upon democratic rights, including the exclusion of Asian Americans.”
In a 2005 interview, Ho described a split during the AAA’s formation between an “activist” group with political aims and a “conservative” group that wanted a more socially and culturally oriented organization. They compromised, deciding on political activities as the primary, but not only, goal of the AAA.
“The AAA and Radcliffe Asian American Women’s Group were political and advocacy oriented. We had very clear objectives,” says Jane Sujen Bock ’81, a former AAA president.
Some Asian American students were not as enthused about the political objectives of the AAA, Houn recalls. “People would rather do cultural, social things — those are euphemisms for apolitical things — and they’re very concerned about their career and they’re very concerned about their own personal status,” Houn says.
And yet in many ways, this perceived dichotomy between political and cultural aims proved itself false. Asian Americans comprised 2.5 percent of the student body in 1976, meaning coming into contact with other Asian Americans, which was a necessary prerequisite to raise consciousness for political organizing, was difficult.
In the fall of 1977, many of the leaders of activist minority student organizations, such as the Black Students Association and the AAA, moved to the Quad, forming an activist network in the process. “In Currier we called it the ‘Third World House,’” Tajima-Peña jokes. “We would organize, we would party, we just had such a great time. That’s why we all still love each other 40 years later.”
Student activists sought to not only build community among themselves, but create welcoming spaces for all students of color on campus.
“It could have been lonely, I think, to be a person of color at this university, but we made being a person of color being the party,” Tajima-Peña says. Collaborating with student leaders from similarly minded organizations, such as the BSA and Harvard-Radcliffe Raza (a Mexican-Latinx student group), they organized mixers, provided culturally specific foods, and danced to disco.
“They were well-liked, very popular, and politically motivated. And that’s what I think drew everybody,” says Ricardo A. Guthrie ’80, a member of the BSA and the Kuumba singers, of the “Third World House” student leaders.
Though the AAA’s activism-inclined leaders recognized the organization’s social and cultural importance on a campus with so few Asian Americans, their main task was to move beyond the apolitical euphemism of “culture.” They wanted to activate Harvard’s Asian American political consciousness.
Lok, one of the women excluded from the banquet, moved to the U.S. from Hong Kong only four years before coming to Harvard. “That’s part of me probably not being as aware of the whole history of being Asian American in this country,” she says.
Without the AAA’s educational efforts, Lok may have remained unfamiliar with Asian American history. The University did not, and still does not, offer an Asian American Studies concentration.
Tajima-Peña, who engaged in Asian American activism prior to College, wanted to pursue her political interests academically. “So [when] I arrived at Harvard, that’s why my declared concentration was Asian American Studies,” Tajima-Peña says. “I was so naive.” Instead, she concentrated in East Asian Studies and Sociology.
The AAA’s petitions and protests to have Asian American Studies or Ethnic Studies instituted at Harvard made little progress. In the late 1970s, Bureau of Study Counsel director and counselor Kiyo Morimoto and Jean Wu led a seminar on Asian American history on campus for several years. After continued mobilization by Harvard’s Asian American students, the seminar was approved for elective credit in 1981. Similar seminars, taught by faculty on top of already jam-packed workloads, were offered on an ad-hoc basis in the following years.
“There were courses in sociology of race relations, and we were hungry for [Asian American Studies] courses,” Bock says. “Many of us tried to explore the area, even though there was no structure for us.”
The AAA used a variety of tactics in the 1970s to teach classmates like Lok about Asian American history. Much of their work was spontaneous and interpersonal — walking between classes, grabbing coffee, and sharing meals at dining halls. The AAA and its leaders helped fellow students navigate their identities through fleeting, individual contact.
“What does it mean [when] you’re ashamed that your father speaks with an accent or broken English?” Houn would ask her peers. “There was a lot of growing up to understand your father was a laundryman not because that’s the best he could have done. It’s probably because his opportunities were limited, and why is that?”
Still, not all students perceived a shared Asian American identity. This fact was particularly striking to Perry Pong ’83, another former AAA president who grew up in a predominantly Chinese American community in San Francisco. Arriving at Harvard, he says, was a bit of a shock: “There were many [Asian American] students who wouldn’t think to join AAA because they didn’t think it was important or their identity. That was always a different concept to me because to me it was obvious that being in the United States influences who you become.”
Many of these Asian American undergraduates would experience a political awakening during their time at Harvard in the late 1970s.
Lok speaks highly of Houn and Tajima-Peña’s role in this evolution. “Flo was amazing. Renee was just a fireball,” she says. “I became more aware as a result of [the banquet] and as a result of talking to them.”
Lok remembers that some of the most influential turning points in her personal development came during the AAA’s large, structured events.
Originally called “mass meetings” (they later rebranded to avoid communist associations, Houn jests), these events ranged from the explicitly educational to celebrations of Asian American cultural production. The events not only reached Asian Americans, but also helped forge coalitions with other organizations for students of color.
John Anthony “Tony” Butler ’80, a former president of the BSA, recalls learning about Asian American history at these events and discovering parallels between the Asian American and African American experience.
Various organizers from the class of 1980 remember fragments of these gatherings, forming a kaleidoscope of Asian American education and cultural production: discussions of Asian American history, an educational presentation at the science center on Japanese American internment, poetry readings from Walter K. Lew, a display of the work of an Asian American stained glass artist.
All of the activists remember the Asian Women’s Slideshow, which Tajima-Peña (now a filmmaker whose work deals with social justice and immigration), Houn, Bock, and several others produced in 1978 for the Radcliffe centennial celebration in order to teach Asian American and Asian women’s history.
“I remember Renee lending me her copy stand so I [could] get photos from Life magazine and other magazines that had professional photographers taking pictures that were more moving than I could capture,” Houn says.
The slideshow was soundtracked by the first album of Asian American music, “A Grain of Sand” by Chris Ijima and Nobuko Miyamoto, which evoked the Vietnam War and Asian American movement. Sepia toned or heavily tinted, the films depict Asian women in protest, silk qipao, Japanese American internment notices, and the beginnings of Chinatowns. The presentation illuminated the historical oppression of Asian women through practices such as foot binding and female infanticide.
“My interest of that slideshow was working through the visual evidence of our commonality,” Tajima-Peña says. “We were kind of discovering our history at the same time. In a lot of places students had to find out about who we were as Asian Americans on our own because the universities just did not support it.”
In their facilitation notes, the organizers wrote that “traditionally, Asian women have been portrayed as delicate flowers, obedient daughters, or exotic concubines. Outdated as these images are, they still haunt us to effect the Asian women and the identity of Asian American women of today.”
To its creators, the process of creating the slideshow was as significant as its content. “You go through all these steps of denial, awareness, investigation, and the pictures don’t lie,” Tajima-Peña says. “Confronting the truth together, it was really something else.”
The 1976 banquet appears to be a striking snapshot of the paradoxical position of Asian Americans — they were simultaneously excluded and not oppressed enough to be a recognized minority group. Impelled by the events of the banquet, the Asian American Association’s leaders worked tirelessly for years after their formation to improve conditions for Asian Americans, and all marginalized groups, on campus.
With the support of other third world student groups, the AAA pressured the Admissions and Dean of Students offices to grant Asian American students full minority status through a series of in-person meetings and petitions, including a personal letter to Epps from Lok and Wong.
One of their major goals, spearheaded by Tajima-Peña and later Bock, was working with the admissions office to establish Asian American recruitment initiatives. “We were militant,” Tajima-Peña says. They created leaflets, pushed written demands, and met with administrators to explain that Asian Americans were, contrary to Jewett’s assertion, “underrepresented” and underserved in Harvard admissions.
“It was our first year, and by October I was flying out to Chicago and L.A. to do these recruiting efforts with Asian Americans in low income neighborhoods in public schools,” Tajima-Peña remembers.
In the 1978 California v. Bakke decision, the Supreme Court upheld affirmative action in college admissions policies and commended Harvard for its minority recruitment. Yet establishing and sustaining these recruitment initiatives was a constant struggle, in particular for the “model minority.” An October 1978 AAA letter to Jewett argued against recent cuts to minority recruitment programs and called for Harvard to live up to the Supreme Court’s praise for the University’s affirmative action.
The letter outlines the necessity of Asian American applicant recruitment: “Higher education is a democratic right of Asian Americans, although we have faced systematic exclusion from such universities as Harvard, especially with regard to Asian Americans from the inner city, rural, and Asian ghetto areas.” It points to specific ways in which Asian Americans were disadvantaged in the admissions process, such as cultural and language barriers and stereotypes of Asian Americans as quiet and exclusively STEM-focused.
Student recruiters coordinated inclusive activities in an effort to increase the number and diversity of Harvard applicants. They held panels, sent out letters, and corresponded with students. At night they took over the admissions office and ran phone-a-thons.
Bock recalls one particular story of recruiting in New York City at the Harvard Club of New York. “We were heading to the recruitment program, and the minority recruiters made a deliberate decision that when we went to the high schools, when we went into community meetings, when we went into the Harvard Club, we were going to dress as ourselves — meaning that we did not comply with the Harvard Club’s dress code when we showed up to the recruiting event. We were actually barred from attending, from coming in, because we looked ‘scruffy.’” It wasn’t until a Harvard administrator supervising the recruitment trip negotiated with the Club that the recruiters were allowed in. The Harvard Club of New York did not respond to requests for comment.
For the most part, though, “the admissions officers were willing to listen and we had the support of Bill Fitzsimmons, who was the director then,” Bock says.
After recruited students were accepted to Harvard, Asian American upperclassmen supported — and encouraged the political involvement of — the incoming freshmen.
“I hadn’t visited Harvard, but when I received my admission, I was invited by AAA to come and meet them in late April or May and stay with one of them in a freshman dorm,” Seiji Yamada ’83 says, recalling how he was recruited into the AAA before he started his freshman year. Yamada would later work a paid position in the admissions office, continuing to facilitate recruitment initiatives on the west coast and in working-class Asian American communities.
Orientation week provided another opportunity to engage incoming freshmen. Soon after the banquet incident, groups including the AAA and the BSA began working to reform the minority orientation program.
In mid-October of 1976, Epps responded to mounting student pressure by agreeing to allow Asian Americans to participate in minority-oriented events sponsored by the Dean of Students Office. But he still refused to recognize Asian Americans as minorities or an oppressed group.
“There was this two-sidedness of you’re a minority, but you’re not really a minority,” Houn recalls.
The AAA and other student groups of color persisted. By 1977, they were reshaping the “minority” orientation program into a “third world” orientation, a name which recognized the commonalities between marginalized groups and which emphasized how third world people are, globally, a majority.
Houn and Wong, along with representatives from other student groups, attended organizing meetings called by the Dean of Students office and were soon leading the orientation’s planning efforts; in 1980, Houn and Wong co-chaired the program themselves.
The orientation acted as an incubator, bringing new students into political groups like the AAA and the BSA through organization-specific events and then using larger events to promote broader coalition building.
“It was like this three year environment where the Asians were first excluded from minority orientation and [told] ‘No they’re not part of this movement of people of color in the United States,’ to these two [Asian American] ladies are chairing the minority orientation,” Houn says.
The AAA’s mission was coalitional from its inception — it envisioned Asian Americans as part of a global network of third world people.
“Asian Americans, I don’t think we could have done it on our own,” Tajima-Peña says. Third world student groups worked together to launch massive protests calling for divestment from the South African Apartheid regime, a Third World student center, and Ethnic Studies.
Ho embodied this coalitional nature: He worked heavily with black and Asian American activists throughout his life and would go on to pioneer Afro-Asian jazz —though he rejected the term “jazz” as colonial and derogatory — performing with Dizzy Gillespie and Archie Shepp.
“You could see him questing to try to span different backgrounds and experiences he had and respected black culture and Chinese culture and became a very valuable mentor and leader for those of us who were enrolled at that time,” Guthrie recalls.
Ho also brought his energy to Malcolm X Weekend, an event organized by the BSA in 1978 and 1979 not only to commemorate Malcolm X, but also to build third world solidarity and imagine paths to a more equitable future.
In 1978, the weekend featured speakers including Yuri Kochiyama and David Sibeko of the Pan African Congress. Kochiyama worked with Malcolm X and built links between Asian American and black organizers. She is regarded by many as a legend and founder of modern Asian American activism. Ho and Houn frequently visited Kochiyama in her Harlem apartment, and they were instrumental in bringing her to campus.
“It was meaningful that we got people like Yuri Kochiyama, and learned that there was a Yuri Kochiyama, and how Malcolm X had allies from other groups,” says Butler, a former BSA leader and one of the weekend’s principle organizers.
Still, at the end of four years, Houn and Tajima-Peña knew there was more to be done in the fight for Asian American students on campus.
“I felt like it was a struggle for four years and I’m glad I graduated it,” Houn says. “That sign, that banner sign where I’m standing on the side there” — referring to an image of her at a protest for a Third World student center — “that is the week of my graduation, and I’m still struggling.”
Neither Houn, Tajima-Peña, or Lok can remember a single moment when the University officially defined Asian Americans as minorities; nor is there a single inflection point after which an Asian American political identity was cemented on campus. Instead, their work built gradually. Countless events and conversations, growing piles of petitions, and protests leaving layers of footprints on Harvard’s soil formed the beginnings of Harvard’s accreting Asian America.
Recognizing their struggle was unfinished, Houn and Tajima-Peña passed on their knowledge to Bock, Pong, and a line of Asian American leaders that extends into the present day. “It wasn’t personalities, it wasn’t individuals,” Tajima-Peña says. “It was an organization.”

Whether or not you're an expert in the field of olfaction I'm sure you have heard of the ubiquitous Homesick Candles: College Towns series. For clarity's sake, I'll entertain the possibility that you've been living under a rock for the last two years: Homesick, a company that somehow justifies selling $30 candles, created a candle line that attempts to capture the residential scents of college towns around the country. For example, their Berkeley description reads: “Small batch coffee and ocean air enveloping the town with early morning fog... Notes that don't seem to go together, but just like Berkeley, it's the weird that makes it good.”
The best part is that there are so many college towns to choose from: The Michigan candle smells like “the Big House with spiked hot chocolate” and the Madison candle can make your living room smell like the “cold morning air on game day.” So if you want your midlife crisis to be both artful and pitiful, you can light a candle that smells like deep-seated regret that the best years of your life have already past you.
But, as I was trying to find the most obnoxious candle description, I noticed the incredibly unprofessional oversight that Cambridge was left out of the series. When I eventually reach the final chapter of my life, at 35 or something, I want to spend my last days relaxing to the fragrant aromas I associated with my midterms, empty bank account, and utterly relentless alcoholism. “The good ol’ days.”
There's so much material to work with too: The golden scent of John Harvard's glistening shoe, or the flighty smell of a flock of Canada-Goose-jacket-wearing-tourists making their way through the Yard. So, as any diligent student would do, I've taken it upon myself to create my own Harvard-scented candle.
Introducing Homesick's Cambridge Scent: The Fourth Horseman of Gentrification. “This exquisite aroma will bring you back to a simpler time, where problems were out of sight, and by tenancy laws, legally out of mind. You'll be enraptured by the fresh waft of $8 bagels, $14 coffee, and a line of students at Milk Bar waiting to order 'crack pie.' And yes, it is seriously called crack pie, because its creator said it 'tastes like crack.' (I actually googled 'is it possible to gentrify crack,' but all I got were links to America's opium addiction.) Each candle is made from oil personally donated by Harvard's biggest investees. And rumor has it, every time you light up a candle a Final Club starts playing Mo Bamba.”
Adhering to Homesick standards, the candle is made with an all natural soy wax blend, molded by unpaid Harvard Shop laborers and tinted with a crimson hue. The candle burns for four years straight. Actually, non-stop. No matter how much you beg and plead for a break it just keeps on burning. Plus it fits perfectly on your mantle, where nobody will comment on it because nobody cares.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Harvard College official threatened Harvard Radio Broadcasting – commonly known by its call name WHRB – with “administrative probation” because the group hosted a widely publicized event featuring the rapper Lil Pump, according to an email sent by the station’s president March 9.
Lil Pump, who is famous for stating, inaccurately, that he dropped out of Harvard College, visited WHRB on Feb. 28 to promote his new album “Harverd Dropout.” At the event, WHRB member Griffin R. Andres ’21 interviewed Lil Pump about his career and attendees browsed the rapper’s merchandise.
WHRB President Kiran O. Hampton '20 wrote to the station's undergraduate email list Saturday that the organization "may have been placed on probation" by the College, according to a copy of the email sent to The Crimson by Jensen E. Davis '20, an inactive WHRB member and Crimson magazine editor.
Hampton wrote that JonRobert Bagley – the associate dean of student organizations and resources at the Dean of Students Office – verbally notified him that the College placed the radio station on administrative probation shortly after the Lil Pump event.
Groups placed on “administrative probation” may temporarily lose the ability to reserve College spaces and recruit new members at Harvard-sponsored events.
Though Bagley allegedly “promised to send a formal email to initiate proceedings,” Hampton wrote in his email that administrators never sent such a note.
“The email never arrived, his boss did not seem particularly concerned, and the formal probationary sanction is much more serious than what JR described, so I suspect we are not actually on probation,” Hampton wrote. “I am meeting with some administration people to check it out.”
College spokesperson Aaron M. Goldman wrote in a Tuesday email that WHRB is “not currently” on administrative probation.
“We are not going to have any comment on the specifics of conversations between the College and any student organizations,” Goldman wrote. “Their current status is that they are an Independent Student Organization (ISO) and are not currently under probation.”
Goldman declined to comment on whether Bagley or other College administrators told WHRB they planned to place the group on probation. He also declined to comment on whether the event that WHRB hosted with Lil Pump violated any College policies.
WHRB is a recognized student group at the College, meaning it is subject to College regulations that require it to register certain kinds of club events with the Dean of Students Office. Such events include those with more than 100 anticipated attendees, those at which goods or merchandise are sold, and those at which high-profile guests are in attendance, according to a Dean of Student Office “Recognized Student Organization Resource & Policy Guide” handbook provided to officers of student organizations at a mandatory meeting with College administrators last fall.
“Student organizations inviting dignitaries and other high profile individuals should begin to work with the Student Engagement Team prior to extending an invitation,” the handbook reads.
Hampton declined to comment on what policies Bagley told him the station violated.
The handbook details four possible outcomes “in the event of an allegation that Harvard’s policies have not been followed by members of a recognized student organization”: Warning, Period of Probation, Suspension, and Revocation.
“Probation is a period of time during which the student organization is given the opportunity to demonstrate its ability to abide by the policies and procedures articulated in this guide and the Harvard College Handbook for Students,” the handout reads. “Additional accompanying terms may include restrictions on the ability to host social functions, room booking, and participation in the Involvement Fair.”
The College first put a student organization on “administrative probation” in February 2018. After campus religious group Harvard College Faith and Action asked an assistant Bible course leader to step down from her role after she began dating another woman, administrators announced the group would serve a year-long probation, though the punishment had little practical effect. Last semester, the Dean of Students Office introduced updated disciplinary procedures for student organizations in violation of College policies.
In his email, Hampton urged radio affiliates to exercise caution in light of the potential disciplinary measures.
“Regardless of the specific penalty, now is not a good time to be goofing off,” he wrote. “Do not make noise immediately outside the station, keep the speakers quiet at night, and avoid unnecessary risks.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana emphasized the “unique” nature of the House system and the faculty dean role in response to questions on student concerns about living in Winthrop House amid controversy over Winthrop Faculty Dean Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr.’s decision to represent film producer Harvey Weinstein.
Khurana did not directly comment in an interview Tuesday on whether he has heard concerns from freshmen who may be placed in Winthrop or students currently living in the house. Sullivan’s defense of Weinstein — who currently faces five sexual assault charges — has sparked student protests and open letters calling for his removal as faculty dean.
Asked about Sullivan, Khurana instead pointed to his goal of ensuring the house system functions as “the nexus” of services and support for students.
“Our focus is to ensure that that is working well,” he said. “What we want to do is make sure that the house in its orientation and the expectations that students have of the house really ties to a special responsibility to the well-being of the entire student body and [those] who are part of that community.”
Sullivan has responded to students’ concerns in a series of emails to Winthrop affiliates. In one, he said defense lawyers have a duty to represent the “unpopular defendant.” In another, he wrote about “support structures” he and fellow Winthrop Faculty Dean Stephanie R. Robinson planned to institute, including designating Resident Dean Linda D. M. Chavers as the “point person” for issues related to sexual misconduct.
In an interview last month, Khurana responded to questions about student concerns regarding Sullivan’s decision to represent Weinstein by emphasizing his support for "academic freedom." He added in the February interview that he was “actively in communication” with Sullivan so that Khurana could “adjust” to community members’ needs.
Khurana declined to comment Tuesday on whether he has met with Sullivan since.
On Feb. 26, Khurana announced a “climate review” of Winthrop House, led by former Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67. At the time, Khurana wrote that the College decided to launch the review after hearing concerns about Sullivan’s decision to defend Weinstein.
The review has two parts: House affiliates can meet with Dingman or Bok Center Director of Educational Research and Evaluation Jenny Bergeron in person. They can also fill out an online survey Dingman sent March 6, which Khurana said is still open.
Khurana also said people do not fully understand the distinction between a house and a dorm, or the role of the faculty dean.
“Our house system is unique. It's not understood well. It's not a dorm, but it is, in fact, the linchpin of our students services to be delivered,” he said. “Through our tutors, through the work of the Resident Dean, from the work of the Faculty Dean, critical student services are operating through our house system.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
World-famous cellist Yo-Yo Ma ’76 and President of the New York Philharmonic Deborah Borda discussed strategies for broadening public access to classical music in order to enact social change at Harvard Business School Wednesday.
The panel, entitled “Art, Music, and Social Justice,” featured a surprise cello performance by Ma and explored music’s ability to give people a sense of “pride and dignity.” Harvard Business School professors Rohit Deshpandé and Henry W. McGee ’74 moderated the discussion.
Ma argued music can help humanity.
“It’s never art for art’s sake,” he said. “Art for life’s sake, or I’d say even further, art for us, for humans… We invented these things because we think they will help us.”
Ma discussed his work with various activists, particularly fellow musician Vijay Gupta. Ma and Borda commended Gupta’s work with the Street Symphony in Los Angeles and a women’s prison, and Ma praised him for “acting like a human” and treating every person with dignity and respect.
Ma cited his outreach in Flint, Mich. as an example of prioritizing the vision of local residents and artists when planning a performance. Ma said when he asks local residents how they want to represent themselves, they reply, “We want to show you what we have done with our community, and in spite of all the bad news, how resilient we are.’
As President and CEO of the New York Philharmonic, Borda shared new initiatives she has undertaken to extend the diversity of musical representation within the industry.
“[Symphony orchestras] are creatures of the 18th century, we’re trying to bring them into the 21st century,” she said. “If you look at the canon, there’s another enormous issue: All the music we play is written by men.”
Borda described her work on Project 19, the Philharmonic’s initiative to celebrate the centennial anniversary of the 19th Amendment of the United States Constitution, which prohibited denying citizens the right to vote on the basis of sex.
“We have commissioned 19 women, all different ages and cultural and racial diversities, to write world premieres for the New York Philharmonic,” she said to enthusiastic applause from the audience.
“I thought everyone in the hall was touched by that and I too was very touched by that,” said audience member Mary Jane Kornacki. “[Borda’s] really a stellar example of marrying something that we may think of as an elitist form, classical music, and making it with purpose to better society, and not just for the few in the concert hall.”
Rebecca Masland, who also attended the panel, said she thought the talk was revealing, especially in its pairing of music and social justice.
“I didn’t really grasp it until during the program, when Yo-Yo Ma talked about social responsibility and being a human being and acting like one,” she said.
Music Department Preceptor Katherine Pukinskis, who attended the talk, said she thought the event was a "wonderful" opportunity to hear about music outside of the context of a concert hall.
“I think that was the most inspiring part of it for me, you know, is that we get good examples of the work that is being done and awareness that we can all do more,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The faculty committee tasked with recommending changes to undergraduate course registration proposed that the Faculty of Arts and Sciences keep “shopping week” until at least 2022 at the Faculty Council’s biweekly meeting Wednesday.
Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda Claybaugh and Philosophy Professor Bernhard Nickel, who chairs the committee, presented the proposal to the Council — FAS’s highest governing body — alongside a final report from the committee.
The committee proposed that a new group be formed to “look into registration” more broadly, according to Council member David L. Howell. The new committee will spend the next several years collecting data on course enrollment trends and studying the impact of factors like graduate student unionization, the College’s recent schedule change, and the new sciences campus in Allston on course enrollment. The new group will produce a report in spring 2022.
“The new committee will collect data to have a more robust understanding of the predictability of enrollment,” Howell wrote in an email Wednesday. “Until then, the current system of shopping will remain basically in place.”
The committee also proposed reforms to the way courses with limited space conduct lotteries to choose enrollees — one of several “in-between” resolutions to the shopping week debate the Council discussed at their last meeting.
Faculty have debated the merits of eliminating shopping week for years. Some argue that the delay in finalizing course enrollments created by shopping week leads to job insecurity for teaching fellows and complicates the application process for loan deferments, fellowships, and scholarships. Others praise shopping week for the flexibility in scheduling it provides undergraduates.
The debate resurfaced in March 2018, when Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana brought the topic up at a meeting of the full faculty without making any formal proposal. In response, the Council voted in September to form a committee to consider possible changes to course registration.
In the months since its formation, the committee launched a website explaining the debate and encouraging student input. Claybaugh, who served on the committee, wrote in an emailed statement Wednesday that the committee hopes to solicit further feedback from undergraduate and graduate students, staff, and faculty before any changes are finalized.
“I'm not yet able to speak publicly about the committee's proposal, but I look forward to sharing it with the entire Harvard College community as soon as I'm free to do so,” Claybaugh wrote. “This is an important question, and we don't want to decide it before hearing from everyone in our community.”
The Council also heard two other proposals at its Tuesday meeting — one to create a new masters of science and masters of business administration dual degree program and another on the College’s quantitative reasoning requirement.
Professors Mark C. Fishman and Douglas Melton, Human Developmental and Regenerative Biology Director of Undergraduate Studies William J. Anderson, and Dean for Academic Programs and Diversity Sheila Thomas presented the joint degree program proposal, which aims to provide life sciences instruction to Harvard Business School students interested in entering fields like pharmaceuticals and biotechnology. Prospective students will apply through the Business School, and the program will take two and a half years to complete.
Claybaugh and Dean of Faculty Affairs and Planning Nina Zipser presented the quantitative reasoning proposal. The proposed changes would allow students to count extant courses focused on “the ability to work with data” within different disciplines towards the requirement, Howell wrote.
All three proposals were well-received by Council members, according to Howell.
“My sense is that [the Council] was positively disposed to all of them,” he wrote. “We had questions, of course, but I personally felt that the people presenting the proposals did a good job of responding and allaying any concerns.”
The Council will vote on whether to endorse the shopping week proposal and the other two proposals at its next meeting on March 27, according to Howell. They will then go before the full Faculty for discussion and a vote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s graduate student union delivered a petition to Massachusetts Hall during a rally attended by more than 150 supporters — including Cambridge City Councillors and members of labor unions across Massachusetts — Wednesday.
The petition by Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers calls for a contract provision that would allow student workers to choose to pursue a third-party grievance procedure for sexual harassment and discrimination complaints. Petitioners also demanded more frequent bargaining sessions. Signed by more than 2,000 student workers, Harvard affiliates, and other supporters, the petition was supported by a majority of the union’s bargaining unit, according to a press release from HGSU-UAW and Ege Yumusak ’16, a member of the HGSU-UAW bargaining committee.
Students and supporters from other unions across the state gathered for the rally, entitled “Time’s Up Harvard”, at Harvard’s Science Center Plaza at noon. The Undergraduate Council, which voted to support HGSU-UAW’s petition last Sunday, promoted the event to all undergraduates in an email Wednesday morning.
The event featured speakers including Greater Boston Labor Council Executive Secretary-Treasurer Richard Rogers and Cambridge City Councillors Sumbul Siddiqui and E. Denise Simmons.
After an hour, the participants marched across Harvard Yard to Massachusetts Hall, which houses University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s office. Three people then went inside to deliver the petition.
After several minutes of chanting, Bacow walked out and told the crowd he had stepped out of a faculty meeting to inform the union members present that the University wants “what’s best for you.”
“We want a contract, too,” Bacow said. “We are bargaining in good faith, we will work with you in good faith.”
After being interrupted by protesters, Bacow asked to be allowed to finish.
“We also don’t want sexual harassment on this campus,” he said. “We are working towards the same ends as you are and we will work with you.”
Bargaining committee member Rachel J. Sandalow-Ash ’15 wrote in an emailed statement that the union’s proposed anti-discrimination contract provision offers a model “that has served both student workers at other universities and members of other campus unions here at Harvard well.” HGSU-UAW’s proposal would allow student workers to choose between the University’s internal dispute resolution procedures and a third-party neutral arbitration procedure when discrimination issues like sexual misconduct arise.
“Under the status quo, survivors of discrimination and harassment must go through Harvard’s internal offices, which have too often discouraged student workers from reporting; failed to protect those who do report; and failed to hold powerful perpetrators accountable,” Sandalow-Ash wrote, in reference to an ongoing Title IX investigation into Government Professor Emeritus Jorge I. Dominguez.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an emailed statement that the University has multiple concerns about the union’s proposal.
“HGSU-UAW has proposed grievances and arbitration rights that would skip over the detailed investigatory process that is in place to ensure thoroughness, fair play and due process for the complainant and respondent alike,” Swain wrote. “The University would underline that an independent arbitrator would have no legal power to issue sanctions or any form of punishment on an offending faculty, student or employee.”
“It would also place many of the complainants and respondents, along with those who may have been witnesses to the event(s) in question, face-to-face in an adversarial arbitration hearing, potentially with lawyers and cross-examination, something the University does not believe is appropriate for these important, complex and sensitive issues,” Swain added.
Swain wrote that Harvard’s current procedure on claims of sexual assault and discrimination was created with “extensive” input from across the University and that the union’s proposal would create different investigatory process for different groups of students.
The University’s counter-proposal would give the union representation on one existing and two new “working groups” on reforming policies related to Title IX — a federal anti-gender discrimination law — and “other forms of discrimination and misconduct,” according to Swain.
He wrote that the University’s proposal offers contractual protection for student workers from retaliation for pursuing claims of discrimination, an “impartial and unbiased panel” for appeals, and a contractual guarantee that student workers will not be pressured to accept informal resolution in place of pursuing a formal complaint.
Throughout five months of collective bargaining with the University, HGSU-UAW has also consistently called for the University to grant more time in the negotiating room.
“Every day without a contract is a day without protections from harassment and discrimination; a day without rights and support for international student workers; and a day without comprehensive and affordable health, vision, and dental care,” Yumusak wrote in an emailed statement. “And we know that in order to achieve a strong contract, we need more time at the bargaining table.”
Swain wrote that negotiations are “active and ongoing.”
“Many of the items being negotiated by HGSU-UAW and the University are complex and take time to be vetted, including outside of bargaining meetings, in order for the University to respond appropriately,” he wrote.
Harvard and HGSU-UAW negotiators recently formed sub-committees that also meet between sessions to expedite agreements on certain proposals, according to Swain.
Bargaining committee member Madeleine F. Jennewein wrote in an emailed statement that she hopes the rally will convince the University to agree to the union’s proposal on sexual harassment and discrimination.
“When we return to the bargaining table on Friday, we hope that the administration will agree to include these crucial civil rights protections in our contract,” Jennewein wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 14, 2019 at 5:59 p.m.
Five Harvard alumni were arrested and charged for conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud in a nationwide scheme to fraudulently secure admission for their children to top universities through millions of dollars in bribes and falsified standardized test answers.
Another alumnus, who allegedly took standardized tests like the SAT and ACT in place of college applicants, was charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud.
The case — the largest admissions scam ever prosecuted by the United States Department of Justice — has once again focused attention on the admissions practices of the nation’s most selective universities. The seven Harvard affiliates under indictment are part of a group of 50 individuals — including actresses Lori A. Loughlin and Felicity K. Huffman and multiple corporate executives — who face charges in connection with the investigation.
As part of the alleged cheating operation, wealthy parents paid a college consulting company millions to bribe varsity sports coaches to falsely classify their children as athletic recruits, vastly increasing the prospective students’ chances of admission. Though athletic directors and coaches at other prominent universities — including Yale and Stanford University — are facing charges for participating in the scheme, Harvard staff appear not to have communicated with the parents now under indictment.
College graduates Gregory O. Colburn ’79 and Stephen P. Semprevivo ’88; Business School degree-holders Douglas M. Hodge and John B. Wilson; and Law School alumna Elisabeth Kimmel are five of the 33 parents who are accused of using bribes to secure spots at top universities for their children. None of the individuals responded to requests for comment for this story.
Mark E. Riddell ’04, the former director of exam preparation at IMG Academy in Florida, allegedly tampered with students’ standardized test answers and, in at least one instance, received an exam from a compromised test administrator and took it himself. He is cooperating with investigators and has agreed to plead guilty to all charges against him, according to prosecutors.
“He didn't have inside information about the answers, he was just smart enough to get a near perfect score on demand or to calibrate the score," the U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts, Andrew Lelling, said of Riddell.
Riddell said in a statement released by his lawyers on Wednesday that he is “profoundly sorry” for the “damage” and “grief” he caused.
At least two parents — including Wilson — allegedly told the college consultant company at the center of the cheating scheme that they wanted their children admitted to Harvard, according to the affidavit. Wilson allegedly funnelled at least $500,000 to an account he believed would be used to pay off a “senior women’s administrator” at the University to designate his daughter as an athletic recruit.
“So I got the senior women’s administrator at Harvard is going to give us a spot. What we have to do is we’ll have to give her $500,000,” an informant from the consulting company told Wilson. “That money, obviously, like the others, will go through my foundation and then I will fund the senior women’s administrator at Harvard.”
Unbeknownst to Wilson, though, that so-called administrator was “fictitious,” and the Massachusetts account to which he wired the money was opened at the direction of federal investigators.
Jane Buckingham, who allegedly paid tens of thousands of dollars to have Riddell take the ACT in her son’s place, likened the scheme to “cur[ing] cancer.”
“I know this is craziness, I know it is,” Buckingham said. “But, you know, peace in the Middle East. You know, Harvard, the rest of it. I have faith in you.”
Tuesday’s indictment also shone a spotlight on longstanding attempts by wealthy parents to increase their children’s admissions chances at prominent universities.
The ongoing lawsuit against Harvard alleging it discriminates against Asian Americans in its admissions process has revealed that the College’s admissions office maintains a secretive “Dean’s List” and “Director’s List” – comprised of donors’ relatives and others with special connections to the University. The lists boast an average acceptance rate of 42.2 percent in recent years, more than nine times the overall acceptance rate for the Class of 2022.
In addition, court filings released over the summer revealed that members of the University Development Office, which solicits alumni donations, regularly meet with Dean of Admissions William R. Fitzsimmons ’67. Private emails among administrators unveiled during the three-week trial brought to light a number of cases in which Harvard favors those who fund it, tying Harvard hopefuls to monumental donations, buildings, and art collections.
The alleged cheating conspiracy unsealed by federal investigators on Tuesday marks at least the second time in less than six months that top universities have been forced to reckon with allegations that students submitted falsified application materials in order to gain admission.
In November 2018, the New York Times published an investigative report detailing allegations of student abuse and rampant application fraud at T.M. Landry College Preparatory School, a Louisiana high school famous for getting underprivileged youth into Ivy League colleges and other highly selective universities, including Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rhode Island Governor Gina M. Raimondo ’93 made the case for pragmatism in state government at the annual Edwin L. Godkin Lecture hosted at the Harvard Kennedy School Wednesday night.
Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf moderated the talk, initiating conversation with Raimondo and facilitating audience questions. During the discussion, Raimondo devoted significant time to the importance of making compromises.
“When I think of moderate, I think of someone who is willing to compromise to get things done,” Raimondo said. “It’s not about politicians. What are you going to do for your constituents? And that means you have to sometimes meet in the middle to produce results.”
Raimondo talked about how she worked to grow Rhode Island’s economy after decades of manufacturing job losses in the state, as well as a spike in unemployment after the 2008 recession. She said a central goal of her gubernatorial campaign in 2014 was to bring unemployment down and to recruit companies to come to Rhode Island.
Despite the lecture’s title, “Making Tough Decisions,” Raimondo said it was not difficult for her to base her 2010 state treasurer campaign on reducing public employees’ pensions in the wake of the recession. At the time, the decision sparked controversy, but she argued that the policy would ensure long-term stability for the state’s pension fund.
“I didn’t think there was any alternative,” she said. “It was a very difficult political choice, and all my political advisors advised me against it. I knew the politics and the political ramifications would be challenging, but in good conscience there was no other alternative.”
Raimondo also took the opportunity Wednesday night to criticize the state of Oklahoma’s recent decision to limit the public school week to four days to manage the state’s budget crisis.
“They have such religion around taxes,” she said.
Raimondo also stressed the importance of effective governance for engaging constituents in the political process.
“If everything we do is poorly executed, people lose faith in government,” she said. “And when people lose faith in government, then they just say, ‘it doesn’t matter who’s in office why should I vote, let’s just cut taxes and make government small, government is the problem.’ It makes it very hard for those of us who actually believe in effective government to make the case.”
“There’s plenty of time to go make money, but there’s not always a great time to change the world for the better,” Raimondo added.
Jia Chen, a mid-career MPA student at the Kennedy School, said she enjoyed seeing a female political leader come speak.
“As a female student, I would never lose a chance to see an inspiring female leader,” Chen said. “I think she really cares about what happens at the end of the day.”
Anagha Kumar ’22 said Raimondo’s focus on Rhode Island’s residents’ needs was encouraging.
“I think she’s been extremely inspiring as being a fiscally conservative Democrat…it’s interesting to see how she deals with dissent from both sides and leads her life as a moderate,” Kumar said. “She put her constituents as a priority.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A year ago, Harvard women’s basketball entered the Ivy League tournament as the No. 3 seed and was a decided underdog against No. 2 Penn. The Crimson played tough and kept the game close, but 17-of-66 Harvard shooting eventually helped the Quakers edge past the Crimson 57-52 to advance to the championship game.
Harvard (16-11, 9-5 Ivy) and Penn (22-5, 12-2) are gearing up for a rematch this Saturday night at the John J. Lee Amphitheater in New Haven. On the surface, this year’s matchup seems similar. The seed numbers attached to each school are the same and the two teams split their head-to-head matchups this year, as they did last year. The Quakers will again be favored to win.
But the circumstances are in fact different. The tournament will be played in New Haven this year, erasing the home-court advantage Penn gained from playing in the Palestra last year, a year in which the Crimson went 4-9 on the road.
And the gap in the teams’ quality is a lot narrower than their records would suggest. Harvard led the Ivy League in scoring margin this year, averaging 73.8 points per game and conceding 63.4 for a margin of +10.4, up from +6.6 last season. Penn, with averages of 67 points for and 56.7 against, is just a tick behind at +10.3, down from +13.5 last year.
If the two earlier meetings between the Crimson and Penn are any indication, this game will be decided by the finest of margins. Both games reached at least one overtime; Harvard’s home win went to a second.
“I thought we had our chances to win both games,” head coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said, “as they probably feel they did. I feel really confident going into the weekend and I won’t be surprised if it’s close because it’s just two good teams battling it out.”
Four of the Crimson’s five Ivy League losses this year were by five points or fewer. That includes all three games it lost to Penn and Princeton, the Ivy League’s perennial powerhouses. Harvard went just 2-4 in games decided by fewer than 10 points, while Penn went 5-1. In a game that is very likely to come down to the wire again, the Crimson will hope that there is some regression to the mean on both sides.
This has been a year of milestones for Harvard. Both junior Katie Benzan and co-captain Madeline Raster reached 1,000 career points. Benzan also broke first the Crimson record for career three point makes (previously 261) and then last weekend against Columbia set the Ivy League record (273), an outstanding accomplishment for a junior. And Delaney-Smith reached the 600 win mark last weekend against Cornell.
But Harvard is looking for much more than a few individual milestones. It wants to break the Penn-Princeton duopoly — nine straight Ivy League championships between them — and become the first Crimson team to win the Ivy League and reach the NCAA tournament since 2007.
To do so, it will rely heavily upon Benzan, the team’s floor general and primary three-point shooter. One thing is certain: the Wellesley, Mass. native will get her shots, and most of them will come from beyond the arc. In last year’s semifinals, Benzan took 19 threes, hitting six. In the two matchups against the tough Quakers’ defense this season, 24 of her 26 total shots came from deep.
Benzan is the focal point of an offense focused on generating three pointers. Harvard made 130 threes in conference play, 22 more than any other team, and its troika of senior guards — Raster, fellow co-captain Sydney Skinner, and Nani Redford — combine to average 15.6 three point attempts per game.
“Anyone who plays a zone as much as Penn plays a zone is challenging you to beat you with the three,” Delaney-Smith said. “They’re trying to protect the rim and they’re trying to secure the rebound by packing it in, so long range shooters can really bust up a zone.”
It will also be crucial for the Crimson to get the ball inside for some easy baskets against a team that does not give up many. Penn’s suffocating defense is the best in the league against field goals (34%) and three pointers (27%), both percentages that ranked inside the top-10 nationally. For those easy buckets, Harvard will turn to its forwards, junior Jeannie Boehm and sophomore Jadyn Bush, who shoot 44% and 52% from the floor respectively.
Bush and Boehm are also the key pieces for a team that leads the Ivy League in offensive rebounds, defensive rebounds, and rebounding margin (+8.1). The Crimson will be relieved to have Bush back in the lineup after she missed last weekend’s games against Cornell and Columbia due to injury.
“Crashing the offensive boards this weekend will be huge for us,” Raster said, “since Penn plays such tough defense.”
If Harvard will seek to capitalize on an advantage on the boards, Penn will look to do the same with turnovers. The Quakers, led by a trio of experienced guards (captain Ashley Russell and juniors Kendall Grasela and Phoebe Sterba), turn the ball over less than any other team in the conference. The Crimson, meanwhile, has struggled at times to limit turnovers, particularly against stiffer competition.
In four games against Penn and Princeton, Harvard turned the ball over 71 times, a per-game rate that would have ranked last in the conference if prorated over the whole season. Turnovers arguably cost the Crimson victories in all three of its losses to the Quakers and Tigers.
“Other than our Notre Dame loss, every single loss has come down to the last minute of play,” Delaney-Smith said, “and I think it has come down to fouls and turnovers. Hopefully we have learned that painfully and we can get it all corrected.”
Harvard’s big improvement this season has come on the defensive end. A year after allowing opponents to shoot 40% from the floor and 34% from three, the Crimson has become the best defense in the conference outside of southeastern Pennsylvania, holding opponents to 36% shooting and 28% from beyond the arc.
Harvard will need to keep up its defensive effort against a dominant Penn frontline. The matchup between the bigs — Boehm and Bush for the Crimson, sophomore Eleah Parker and senior Princess Aghayere — could prove crucial. Parker is arguably the best player in the Ivy League not named Bella Alarie.
The 6’4” Charlotte, NC. native is near the top of the Ivy League leaderboards in a number of statistics. She leads the conference in shooting percentage and is the fourth leading scorer, the second best rebounder, and the best shot-blocker in the conference. Parker was also named Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year on Wednesday.
Boehm, who will likely be tasked with guarding Parker, has a big job ahead of her. She struggled offensively in both games against Penn this year, shooting a combined 5-of-22 and averaging six points. But more important for the Winnetka, Ill. native are her defensive responsibilities. Parker, a better than 50% shooter in conference play, shot under 40% against Harvard.
“[Parker] is very very talented so she draws a lot of attention,” Delaney-Smith said, “but we work really hard on our scout and I think our kids do a tremendous job — better than most teams — at following the scout and working hard at it.”
In many ways, these two teams are similar. Both rely heavily upon four key players, two of whom are forwards, one (Benzan for the Crimson, Sterba for Penn) a junior guard who provides firepower from beyond the arc, and one (Raster and Russell) a captain who is a vital cog both offensively and defensively and is an outstanding rebounding guard.
They are two of the three best teams in the Ivy League by any measure, and they will match strength against strength on Saturday in New Haven with an Ivy League tournament championship game berth on the line.
“I think just reinforcing our belief that we can win will be key for dealing with close game situations,” Raster said. “[The Penn game] is just something we have been preparing for all season since we have had such close games all year long, even in non-conference play.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past weekend the Harvard men’s golf team opened up its 2019 spring campaign in Scottsdale, Ariz. at the Michigan Desert Mountain Tournament. If you just consider the scoreboard, it would definitely appear to be a slow start for the group.
The Crimson placed last in a field of 12 teams with a total combined score of 929. Mississippi State pulled out the victory with a score of 856, while Kansas (862) and Marquette (871) rounded out the top three.
The Bulldogs were led by junior Garrett Johnson who appeared at the top of the individual leaderboard as well. Through three rounds he shot nine under par, which included a 66 in his first round, for a total score of 207.
However, considering the circumstances, the result is not as bad as it seems for Harvard. The inclement weather this season has prevented the team from playing and practicing outdoors. Furthermore, this trip to Arizona was much earlier in the season than is customary.
“Usually our first tournament isn’t until a week after spring break,” junior Rij Patel said. “This was a very interesting experience in that we basically just started off our year with one day of [outdoor] practice. We got to play one round of golf before jumping into a tournament.”
A positive of this early competition, no matter the final standings, is that now the Crimson has direct and valuable feedback about where it stands. It will allow the players to focus on what’s required as they head into spring break.
“It was really good for us to go out to Arizona and compete to see where our games were at,” sophomore Grant Fairbairn said. “All of our games were trending in the right direction and we all found super positive things to take away, so it was a really good learning experience overall.”
Despite the team not performing well as a whole, Fairbairn’s play proved to be a bright spot over the weekend. The sophomore found himself tied for 17th on the individual leaderboard with a score of 221. A mediocre second round was sandwiched by two impressive scores of 70 in the first and third.
“In those conditions he played outstandingly,” Patel said of Fairbairn. “To go out in your first round of the year, without playing outdoors, and to shoot two under par at this demanding of a golf course requires you to hit the ball super straight. There is very low margin for error and Grant was hitting it on a string.”
Over the tournament Fairbairn notched 13 birdies with seven of those coming in the final round. Only five other golfers topped this mark.
“My game really clicked for me,” Fairbairn said. “I’m usually a pretty good ball striker. The only real question was whether I was going to putt well, and luckily I found my putter. I was able to convert on a lot of birdie opportunities.”
The second best Harvard performance was turned in by freshman Brian Isztwan. His score of 231, good for 54th at the tournament, was highlighted by a 73 in the first round. The first year student achieved this with 30 pars and eight birdies in total.
That being said, the group will not be completely satisfied with how the event transpired. There are several things that will need to be adjusted as the Crimson gears up for the rest of the season. Even Fairbairn, who had a strong showing, knows that he can be even better.
“I need to follow my routine and my process a little bit more,” Fairbairn said. “I kind of lost myself out there on a couple shots. Overall if I can clean up my process and my routine, my game will be a lot tighter.”
The general feeling after the trip is a positive one. The group is putting aside the 12th place finish and instead focusing on how they can use the experience to their advantage. They gleaned a lot of information from their play, both good and bad. There is still a lot of golf to be played and Harvard is eager and excited for the rest of the season.
“I can’t wait to see what the rest of the season has in store for the team,” Patel said. “All of us had a round below 77. In a tough course like this in your first week out playing golf, that’s a really good sign.”

For the second year in a row, the no. 14 Harvard men’s hockey (17-9-3, 13-7-2 ECAC) team is set to face off against conference travel partner Dartmouth (13-15-4, 10-9-3) in this weekend’s ECAC quarterfinal series.
Just like last year, the Big Green is coming off a 2-1 series win against St. Lawrence, and is the five-seed to the Crimson’s four. Unlike last season, however, Harvard is ranked. Any school can enter the NCAA tournament by winning its conference tournament, but a high enough PairWise ranking — the Crimson sits at no. 14 on that scale as well — can ensure an at-large bid. Harvard can avoid having to run the gauntlet at Lake Placid and still play the NCAA regionals.
But before the team can think that far ahead, it must have a strong enough showing against Dartmouth to boost said ranking. That means righting last season’s errors — in 2018, the Crimson dropped Game 1 versus the Big Green before coming back to win the series.
“Our focus is on Dartmouth this weekend,” said Harvard head coach Ted Donato ’91. “We recognize it as a real benchmark to be able to make it to Lake Placid…. [But] right now, it would be very dangerous for us to look by a very good Dartmouth team who I think has the same thoughts in mind, of getting to Lake Placid…. Both teams have the right to feel confident coming into the series.”
The Crimson secured a top-four seed and a weeklong bye in the last weekend of regular season play when it defeated RPI on March 1. The Whitelaw Cup, awarded to the ECAC regular season champion, was within the team’s reach until a loss at Union the very next day. Harvard will be looking to prove itself after that stumble and return to winning ways — until the defeat, the Crimson was 6-1 in conference play since the start of February.
“It was definitely a tough bus ride home from Union, knowing that we could’ve shared a title at least,” co-captain Michael Floodstrand said. “It stings a little bit, but honestly, I think you use that sting to motivate you. There’s no easy games in this league, and that wasn’t even the playoffs.”
Dartmouth comes into Cambridge on the heels of a 8-0 demolition of the Saints in Sunday’s deciding game. Though the series had seemed even, with the Big Green taking the first game 3-2 but dropping the second in overtime, the offensive showing proved Dartmouth can step up its game when the occasion calls.
Harvard has learned this the hard way — the Crimson’s season-opening loss was a 7-6 OT barnburner in Hanover. Not only is the Big Green riding that triumph, it also benefits from a weekend of play when Harvard did not see action.
“We’ve been just trying to focus on keeping the high pace [in practice],” Floodstrand said. “You got a team like Dartmouth coming in next weekend...who just played three very competitive games, had their season on the line, and won. We were just trying to up the intensity as much as we could, make it game-like.”
The visitors are led by a trio of forwards: sophomore Quin Foreman (12–14—26), rookie Drew O’Connor (16–9—25), and junior Will Graber (10–13—23). Graber and Foreman have become familiar faces to the Crimson over the past few years, and both found the back of the net in their team’s 8-0 rout. In net, Dartmouth has relied on the services of junior Adrian Clark (10-8-3, 2.08 GAA, .921 SV%).
The Big Green’s biggest weakness appears to be special teams — its power play is at 15.5 percent and its penalty kill is at 79.5 percent, and those numbers are even lower within conference play. Even though Harvard’s own PK is less than optimal (76.8%), its efficient man-advantage unit will look to break down Dartmouth’s system. Still, the Big Green went 3-for-4 on the power play in Sunday’s contest against SLU, so its performance can exceed expectations in that respect on any given night.
“We’ve played them before, we know what kind of team they are,” rookie forward Casey Dornbach said. “It’s obviously going to be a jump up in intensity, being [the] playoffs…. For any team we play in the playoffs it’s do or die, and we’ve got to come ready to play and play our game.”
Harvard rode a wave of success to start the new year, entering the national rankings in February for the first time since early in the 2017-2018 season. In no small part is that success due to a freshman class that has hit its stride. The Crimson’s power play (29.4%) is a heartbeat behind UMass’s nation-best squad and features several rookies on its top unit, including forwards Jack Drury and Casey Dornbach. Blue-liner Jack Rathbone plays on the second unit.
Dornbach in particular has found his groove on the man-advantage; he leads all freshmen in assists per game (0.79) and is tied for most points per game (0.97). The Edina, Minn., native recently took home Ivy League Rookie of the Year honors, and has the most points (7–21—28) by a Harvard freshman since Tim Pettit ’04. He and his classmates will need to adjust for the intensity of the playoffs come Friday, but having played at Madison Square Garden and the Beanpot, the rookies do have some big-game experience.
“I know we haven’t been here before, playoffs in college,” Dornbach said. “But just taking it one game at a time, focusing on our system — I think everyone knows what’s on the line, so that kind of speaks for itself. We’ll just have to bring it even more.”
Of course, experienced upperclassmen also play pivotal roles on the team, few more so than junior defenseman Adam Fox (29 GP, 8–32—40). The Ivy League Player of the Year leads the country in assists per game (1.10), and all defenders in assists and points per game (1.38). His point total is tied with a personal best from his freshman year, which he achieved in 35 games. Fox’s playmaking abilities will certainly be key to the Crimson’s success, both on the power play and at even strength.
Meanwhile, co-captain Lewis Zerter-Gossage (17–6—23) and sophomore defenseman Reilly Walsh (11–18—29), who pace the team in goal-scoring and power play goal-scoring respectively, are the ones to watch when Harvard attempts to put home its opportunities.
On the back end, however, the Crimson has less certainty. Senior net-minder Michael Lackey (14-6-3, 2.23 GAA, .920 SV%) settled into his crease as the season progressed and looked to be the team’s go-to goalie, but an injury in last month’s clash against Clarkson has kept him out of play since. Junior Cameron Gornet has risen to the task in his absence (3-1-0, 1.76 GAA, .941 SV%), but the postseason provides a challenge for any backstop. Gornet has not faced Clark or Dartmouth at all in his career, nor has he started a playoff contest.
“[Lackey] seems to have made some progress, which is great,” coach Donato said. “But we would expect that we’ll see [Gornet], at least for Game 1 anyways.”
Both teams have their strengths and flaws, and while the Big Green comes into this series as the underdog it has shown that it can overpower Harvard. The question is whether the new and improved Crimson, which handily overcame a deficit to defeat Dartmouth last month, can finish the task it could not in the beginning of the season. A series loss does not necessarily mean the end of the season for Harvard, but if the team wants to control its fate it will need to make a statement this weekend.

The Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations held its 34th Cultural Rhythms Festival honoring Janet Mock, an acclaimed writer, producer, director, and transgender rights advocate as the Artist of The Year on Saturday.
Cultural Rhythms is an annual event showcasing and celebrating Harvard’s cultural and ethnic diversity, according to the foundation’s website. A day-long event, the festival includes a Q&A with students and The Artist of The Year, a luncheon, and a show in Sanders Theater. This year’s show also featured 12 performances by students and cultural groups.

Janet Mock began her day of festivities at an Artist Conversation event in the Kirkland Junior Common Room. She was welcomed with performances by the Harvard University Band and Najya A. Williams ’20, a poet and activist. Williams, previously honored by the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations for her work on campus, recited her original poem "Motherless Child."

Mock spoke to students about her life experiences navigating her identity as a black, native indigenous Hawaiian, transgender woman. She touched upon topics ranging from the importance of groups having access to space on campus to her relationships with family and friends. A New York Times best-selling author, she also spoke about her two memoirs, “Redefining Realness” (2014) and “Surpassing Certainty” (2017). After the event, a luncheon was held in honor of Mock in the Kirkland Dining Hall which included a performance by FUSIAN, an “East Asian-interest” a capella group.

 Later in the afternoon, the Cultural Rythms Performance took place at Sanders Theater. Emmy Semprun ’22 opened the show by performing a Spanish flamenco dance (above).
“It was such an accepting space. I’ve become friends with all the performers now and we were all cheering each other on,” she said in an interview. “And it was just really nice to see such different performances, but we were all just trying to understand and support each other.”

The Kuumba Singers of Harvard College, the oldest existing Black organization at Harvard College, followed Semprun with several songs from their repertoire.
Founded in 1970, the choir “emerged as a source of community, spiritual inspiration, political motivation and cultural stimulation among the small but growing number of Black students at Harvard,” according to Kuumba’s website.
The Cultural Rhythms Show audience also saw classical dance performances by the Asian American Dance Troupe (right) and Harvard College Deepam, a classical Indian dance group, (left).

 Under Construction, a Christian a capella group, wrapped up the first part of the show with a cover of NF’s “Paralyzed.”

After the intermission, Cultural Rhythms director Hakeem O. I. Angulu ’20 presented Mock with the 2019 Artist of the Year plaque.

Throughout the rest of the evening, other groups took to the stage to showcase their cultural acts, including Mariachi Véritas de Harvard (above) and Harvard Taekwondo Demonstration Team (below).

Following their performances, student representatives from each group were able to speak about and share the significance of their art to their culture and identity (below).

Abyssinia, an East African dance group, performed for the first time at Cultural Rhythms this year (below).
“Performing on Sanders stage, the biggest stage at Harvard, was huge for our community — to have that privilege and visibility,” Aaron Abai ’22 (back), Abyssinia performer and Cultural Dialogue co-director said in an interview.
