After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Just three days after escaping with a win over the Connecticut, the Harvard women’s ice hockey team knew it needed to adjust its mentality. Against the Huskies, the Crimson trailed almost the entire game before scoring two goals in third period to take the victory.
 
No. 4/5 Harvard (12-1-2, 8-1-1 ECAC) rose to the challenge on Friday night against Brown (1-12-3, 0-8-1 ECAC). The Crimson came out ready to play on its way to blanking the Bears, scoring two of its three goals in the first period as it skated to a 3-0 win in its first Ivy League matchup of the new year.
 
“We’re back to where we want to be,” Harvard coach Maura Crowell said. “Obviously we want to continue to improve, but it was definitely a refreshing game for us to play more of our style: speed and crisp passes, going hard to the net, and obviously getting rewarded for that.”
 
It was Crimson goalkeeper Emerance Maschmeyer’s fifth shutout of the season and the first time Brown has been shut out this year.
 
The Bears appeared outmatched from the start, missing passes and showcasing a hesitant style of play. Harvard, which hadn’t lost a game since Nov. 1, was up against a Brown squad that hadn’t won a game in nearly as long.
 
“The exciting part for us today was that it was an Ivy League matchup,” Crowell said. “The team is just so motivated. We don’t talk a whole lot about stats and numbers because I think Brown played really well tonight, and they gave us a run for our money. If you get bogged down in, ‘well, they only have one win,’ you don’t end up with wins.”
 
Senior Gina McDonald netted two points in the win, notching both an assist in the first period and the game-winning goal in the third. After a shot by Natasha Rachlin was blocked by Brown defender Ariana Rucker, the rebound landed directly in McDonald’s path as she came in off the bench. The forward slapped the shot from just below the blue line and tipped it past Brown goalkeeper Aubree Moore to give the Crimson the 3-0 victory.
 
“The puck kind of popped out right to where I was skating into, and I had a clear shot to the net and just tried to get one off quickly,” McDonald said. “It worked out so well. It was like this gift just waiting there for me.”
 
Sophomore forward Miye D’Oench got the scoring started for Harvard halfway through the first period. With the Crimson on the power play, D’Oench received a pass from junior Sami Reber in front of the net and quickly tapped the puck in past Moore to give Harvard the early lead.
 
“It was pretty relieving,” said D’Oench of the early goal. “Especially because we haven’t been all that great on the power play, so to get a power play goal was a big confidence booster. And then once we get one goal, having [Maschmeyer] behind you, you always feel pretty good about that.”
 
Despite the early score, the Crimson showed no signs of letting up as the period continued. After a save by Moore, sophomore Dylanne Crugnale scooped up the loose puck and snuck it past Moore to put Harvard up, 2-0, off her sixth goal of the season.
 
Brown came out stronger after the first break, leading to a track meet atmosphere as the teams skated up and down the ice throughout the second period. Despite both squads getting off eight shots on goal, neither team was able to get much offense going and finished the second period with Harvard still up two goals to none.
 
“Usually we move through the neutral zone with a lot of speed and puck possession, and when they have the puck, we usually can get them to turn it over,” Crowell said. “We’re trying to clean up our neutral zone a little bit better; just getting back to simple plays in the neutral zone, not trying to be so cute with the puck.”
 
Now at the midpoint of the 2013-14 season, the Crimson is looking forward to continuing to improve and building on the gains they’ve made in recent games.
 
“So far this year haven’t played our absolute best, and I thought this game changed that, so that’s really huge for us,” D’Oench said. “I think we’re definitely moving the right way for 2014.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
With the memory of last season’s loss to Princeton and the resulting loss of the Ivy League title still fresh, the Harvard women’s squash team took the courts for its matchup against the Tigers with a whole lot to prove. The Crimson (5-0, 2-0 Ivy) came out on top against Princeton (4-1, 0-1 Ivy), 6-3, at the Murr Center to maintain its perfect season record.
 “It was a big win for us,” co-captain Natasha Anzik said. “Princeton’s definitely one of the teams to beat this year, so I think overall we’re really excited with the performance. Everyone came away with some new things to work on and think about, so all in all it was a really beneficial day.”
The No. 1 Crimson had already dropped an unofficial contest to No. 4 Princeton this season at the Ivy League Scrimmages, making today’s victory all the more meaningful for the team.
“Having lost to them already this season at the scrimmages in November, we were really able to get after it today,” junior co-captain Haley Mendez said. “The pressure was off of us.  We could really just zero in and play our game.  We all came out very strong, it was a great performance all around and we’re all really happy with it.”
Harvard was able to score a more decisive margin of victory on Saturday than either squad has in the past two meetings. In the 2013 season, the Crimson lost to Princeton by just one match, while the Tigers eked by Harvard in equally tight fashion at the scrimmages in November.
“I think you can tell that we’ve come a long way since then, as a team,” Anzik said.  “We’re a lot fitter than we were and a lot mentally tougher, and I really think that the confidence was there today.”
Mental toughness was a common theme for the Crimson throughout the day’s contest. Freshman Dileas MacGowan, playing at the seventh seed position, took Princeton’s Tara Harrington to five sets.  After trailing throughout the match, the rookie managed to evade match point three times to and finally triumphed, 15-13, in the fifth game.
“Dileas MacGowan won a very big match for us today today... it was a huge win,” Anzik said. “For a freshman on the team to be that mentally tough, and fight back from that, it’s a very big deal.”
Mendez also contributed a key victory for Harvard.  The number two player outmaneuvered her opponent, Nicole Bunyan, to notch the win, 11-8, 11-6, 7-11, 11-8.
“It was a very physical match,” Mendez said. “There was a lot of running and it was really hot in there, so it was great to be able to come through for the team and pull out the win.”
For sophomore Isabelle Dowling, today was also a fight to the finish, as she managed to outplay Princeton’s Alexis Saunders and notched her first career win against the Tigers.
“Izzy has been consistently improving throughout the entire season,” Anzik said. “She beat a girl that she’s never beaten before today, and played a very solid game. We are all really proud of her.”
Fellow sophomore Michelle Gemmell also contributed a comeback performance, rallying after dropping her first game, 9-11, to take the next three,11-8,12-10, and 11-7.
For the Tigers, Alexandra Lunt, Hallie Dewey, and Alexandra Toth accounted for Princeton’s three victories of the day at the fourth, sixth, and ninth positions, respectively. Lunt and Toth notched their wins in decisive fashion, taking their respective matches in straight sets, while Dewey battled it out for four sets against Harvard junior Julianne Chu to register the win.
The No. 1 nationally ranked junior Amanda Sobhy glided by the Tigers’ Maria Elena Ubina in straight sets, allowing her opponent to register a team low of seven points the entire match, while the freshman front of Katie Tutrone and Caroline Monrad continued its winning streak, as the third and tenth seeded rookies notched wins for Harvard as well.
With a game against No. 5 Penn following this win for the Crimson, Harvard is keeping its fundamental goals in mind.
“The plan is just about staying consistent,” Anzik said. “We know now that we have everything we need to win, we’re strong enough to be in contention for a national championship game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last time Brown (3-3, 0-3 Ivy) defeated the Harvard men’s swimming and diving team (4-0, 4-0 Ivy), George H.W. Bush was president, Neil Rudenstine was President of Harvard, and many of the current Crimson swimmers were not yet born. Prior to Saturday’s matchup, the Crimson were 80-2 all-time against the Bears, winning the last 19 matchups.
Despite a strong start to their season with three wins against non-Ivy opponents, the Bears losing streak against Harvard has continued into 2014. With a 194-86 victory over the Bears Saturday at Blodgett Pool, the Crimson continued its unbeaten season, with all victories thus far coming against Ancient Eight opponents. Harvard swept the Dartmouth/Cornell tri meet and defeated Columbia in November.
It was the Crimson’s first meet since December 5th, when the team competed in the Texas Invitational, but a training trip to Puerto Rico kept Harvard in racing shape.
“We just got off a very tough week of training in Puerto Rico, and we had a really late flight that got delayed,” senior co-captain Chris Satterthwaite said. “A lot of guys were a little concerned about how they were going to swim, but I think the work paid off.”
Harvard came into the meet ranked No. 24 by the College Swimming Coaches Association.
In its only dual meet at Blodgett, the Crimson honored its eight seniors, swimmers Satterthwaite, Will Brophy, Danny Crigler, Travis Downs, Oliver Lee, Jack Pretto, and Jason Ting, as well as diver Joe Zarrela, for their accomplishments in their four seasons. Since these seniors joined the team, Harvard has placed second at Ivy League Championships every year.
“We have a very tight group of seniors,” Satterthwaite said. “We’ve grown a lot closer as a closer not only over the last four years but also this year…It’s kind of a cool culmination today of our last four years. “
Many of the seniors earned wins on Saturday. Satterthwaite led the charge with victories in the 500-meter freestyle with a time of 4:32.12 and as a member of the 200-meter relay, as well as placing in the top three for the 50-meter freestyle, and 200-meter medley.
“I don’t typically swim the 500, but I’ve raced our distance guys enough to know they always have a very strong finish,” Satterthwaite said. “My thought process was that I knew if I wanted to have a shot at racing our own distance guys I would have to be pretty fresh at the end and have something left in the tank.”
Fellow senior Zarrella was also a strong force on the diving board, sweeping the diving events with victories in the 1m and 3m competitions with scores of 293.48 and 337.50 points, respectively.
Although all eyes were on the seniors in this dual meet, the freshmen of the team pulled out strong performances, with victories from Jack Manchester and Eric Ronda in the 200 backstroke and 200 breaststroke.
Standing out among the class of 2017 was Cliff Goertmiller, who completed the task of the Ironman meet. A swim team tradition for nearly fifty years, it is an event where one freshman is selected by the upperclassman to compete in every event in a meet. He may not have won any points for the Crimson, but his effort was certainly a standout one.
“Every time someone was diving in to race he had to be racing. Nobody else swam in that lane. That was his lane” Satterthwaite said. “It’s a cool thing we do to recognize a freshman’s hard work, and we select someone we see as a real leader in the freshman class.”
Although the team was honoring the seniors for their last dual meet at home, there is still a lot of swimming to be done.
“For the next meet we are going to make sure we’re getting out faster and being a little bit more aggressive in our races and making sure we get everything we can out of each race” Lee said.
The victory keeps Harvard in a tie for first place in the Ivy League against Ancient Eight foe Princeton, which is also undefeated. The two teams will face each other in a tri meet at Yale January 31st.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Frigid temperatures have permeated throughout the Northeast this past week. But even in the mountains of Vermont this Friday, senior Rebecca Nadler was still on fire for the Harvard alpine ski team. 
Nadler’s second place-finish in the women’s giant slalom in Stowe, Vt. this past weekend highlighted the Crimson’s appearance at the Vermont Carnival.
Harvard sits in 12th place out of the 13 competing teams at Mt. Mansfield through the first day of the tournament in the team’s first EISA competition of the year. The second day of competition, scheduled for Saturday, was cancelled due to inclement weather. There are plans in the works to reschedule the event, but no date has yet been announced.
“There were some pretty challenging conditions at training,” junior Elizabeth Strong said. “For example, it was -25 [degrees] one day and 58 degrees the next day--really brutal temperatures. The snow was melting.”
The Crimson finished with the first day of the meet with 80 points, just two shy of tying for ninth place with St. Lawrence, who notched 82 points through the first day.  The University of Vermont leads the pack of 13 teams with 234 points.
“It was a really strong showing,” Strong said. “[The women’s giant slalom] was probably one of the better races that we’ve ever had in general.”
68 of Harvard’s points came from the women’s giant slalom performance. Nadler was the top finisher for the Crimson, recording a combined time of 2:03:51 over her two runs. That mark was just .80 seconds behind the winner Kate Ryley of Vermont, who also won the event in last year’s Vermont Carnival. The next closest competitor  - Lizzie Kistler of Dartmouth – clocked in at more than a full second behind Nadler.
Nadler had started off strong in the giant slalom event in last year’s Vermont Carnival, standing in second through her first heat. But a slow second run dropped her down to 11th place in the event.
This year, she continued her strong performance into the second heat, finishing only 3 hundredths of a second slower on her second run than on her first. Her time this year marked more than a five second improvement in her performance compared with just last year in the same event at Mt. Mansfield.
Strong was the next fastest Crimson racer, recording a combined 2:13:21 in her two runs to place 30th in the competition. Freshman Kaitlyn Gibson and sophomore Samantha Udolf rounded out the Harvard giant slalom performance with 41st and 46th place finishes, respectively. The combined performances of these four racers were good to place Harvard seventh out of 13 teams in the women’s giant slalom. Vermont led the women’s event with 107 points, just one above second place Dartmouth.
“The snow was really icy,” Strong said. “...In normal conditions the course would be really chopped up and hard to ski in [for skiers with late starts]. But the ice made it fair for everyone.”
The men’s giant slalom team contributed the Crimson’s other 12 points on the day. Senior Ian Anderson was the top Harvard finisher with a time of 2:09:65, fast enough for 40th place. Sophomore Jack Stobierski was right behind in 43rd place with a time of 2:11:03. Sophomore Matthew Mansson had a strong run of 1:02:86 in his first run, but a miscue on the second run prevented him from getting any points for the team.
“Matt had a really good first run but he fell pretty hard the second run,” Strong said. “But his first run was really encouraging.”
Sophomore Simon Merryweather and freshman Danny Fowler both did not finish in the event. The combined point total from the four skiers performances landed the men’s team in last place, a full 5 points behind the next closest team, Bates. Vermont took first place in the men’s event, combining for 127 points.
Vermont also boasted the best men’s individual giant slalom performance. Dominique Garand led the men with a combined time of 1:58:88 in his two heats, .85 seconds faster than the next faster competitor, Robert Overing of Dartmouth. These two racers were the only ones to break the two-minute barrier on Friday on the men’s side.
The team is satisfied with its performance, given the adverse weather conditions.
“We were there just trying to make the best of it.” Strong said. “It was really exciting to race feeling a little underprepared, but then [to have] a really good performance.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The 2014 Rivalry on Ice lived up to its billing Saturday night, with a sell-out crowd at hand in Madison Square Garden, several guests including Mark Messier and Secretary of State John Kerry, and various events and activities for each fanbase before and after the game. But for Harvard, the game itself was marked with frustration, with the Crimson suffering a 5-1 loss to ancient rival, No. 10 Yale.
Entering the second period knotted at one, Harvard looked to continue the momentum it had established in the second half of the first period. But early in the second period, Bulldog Cody Learned snuck a slap-shot past senior goaltender Raphael Girard, getting the fortunate bounce for Yale, and that was all it took.
Just under three minutes later, the Bulldogs clamped down even further with two goals in 26 seconds, by Gus Young and Learned, prompting Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 to replace Girard with junior Steve Michalek.
Yale did not let up thereafter, as they continued to apply pressure on offense while at the same time thwarted any chances Harvard tried to muster. In fact, the Crimson recorded just 10 shots after the first period – six in the second and four in the third – while Bulldog goalie Alex Lyon stopped 23 of the 24 shots he faced all game.
“I don’t think we ever quite rebounded the way we needed to from that,” freshman Luke Esposito said. “That’s just something we've got to learn from, dealing with adversity. We’re a young team and we talk about learning from our experiences here. We need to move past the bad bounces and get back to playing the way we want to play.”
Kenny Agostino added a goal midway through the final frame to put the game out of reach for Harvard, punching back in a rebound after Gus Young threw it at the net after he picked up the puck off the backboards from a deflected Agostino pass.
QUICK SHOT TO THE GUT
Harvard and Yale traded punches in the first period, with Mike Doherty netting a goal at 4:23 in the first and sophomore forward Jimmy Vesey scoring a power-play goal at 10:51.
But Learned’s goal, and especially the quick burst of two goals soon after, seemed to knock the wind of out the Crimson.
“The first goal kind of knocked us off balance and we weren’t able to truly recover,” Donato said. “To give up the second and third goal [of the second period] only thirty seconds apart ...was the difference in the game."
The Bulldogs only got better after their first goal in the second period, while Harvard had lost all of its momentum and could not overcome this three-goal deficit in the end.
“You could just tell on the bench that our resolve was a little bit different,” Yale coach Keith Allain said. “We were better offensively but we were also better defensively. Once we got our grips on the lead we stiffened even more defensively and they really didn’t have much going after that.”
ANCIENT RIVALRY ON ICE
Over one hundred years after their first meeting, Harvard and Yale returned to New York to play their 242nd game in this Ivy-League matchup. The Bulldogs defeated the Crimson, 5-4, on February 26th, 1900 at the now-demolished St. Nicholas rink in the Upper East Side in New York in the first contest of the now third-longest running rivalry in college hockey.
The two teams had not faced off in New York since 1970, where the Crimson defeated the Bulldogs, 6-2, in Madison Square Garden. Having signed a two-year contract with Leverage Agency, a New York-based sports, entertainment, and media marketing company, the ancient foes look to continue the Rivalry on Ice game in New York, with the Barclays Center slated as 2015’s venue.
Not only boasting a unique setting, the Rivalry on Ice featured several notable guests. Mark Messier, Hall of Fame center and uncle of the Crimson’s Luke Esposito, promoted the game, while Secretary of State John Kerry and NHL players Dominic Moore ’03 and Mike Richter were on hand to drop the first puck.
Though a neutral site, the majority of the 15,524 in attendance rooted for Yale in this exhibition match.
“The energy was outstanding,” Bulldog captain Jesse Root said. “The support from the Yale fanbase was pretty incredible, we heard them chanting 'Go Bulldogs' right from the start so that was pretty inspiring.”
The outcome of the game may not have been what Harvard had hoped for, but the team was thrilled with the chance of playing in such a historical place as Madison Square Garden, and looks to continue this event in the future.
“This was a first class event,” Donato said. “Obviously we are frustrated with the result but the overall event and experience and show of support on both sides was something to be marveled at. And certainly if there was a possibly of keeping this tradition it would be good for both schools and for college hockey.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard-Yale rivalry moved from the field to the ice as the Crimson women’s hockey team (12-2-2, 8-2-1 ECAC) took on the Bulldogs (6-10-1, 4-5-1) this weekend at the Bright-Landry Center. But this time, Harvard was unable to capture victory in its own Yale matchup, falling to the Bulldogs, 2-0.
Coming off of a 12-game unbeaten streak, the Crimson failed to come back as the Bulldogs secured the game with goals in the first and second period while Harvard did not respond, giving the team its first loss since November 1st at Rensselaer. It is the first time Yale has defeated the Crimson since 2005.
In recent years, Harvard has been nearly unstoppable at home, with a record of 7-0-2 this season alone in the Bright-Landry center. The team had lost only nine games in Cambridge since the start of the 2010-2011 season, but the Bulldogs have ended its nine-game home winning streak.
Yale came out quick, scoring early on in the first period. Junior forward Jackie Raines took the puck from the right side and dished it to sophomore forward Hanna Astrom in the circle. When a Crimson defender went for the puck, it popped into the air, giving Raines the opportunity to move in for a hard shot into the right corner of the net past sophomore goalie Emerance Maschmeyer. The goal was Raines’s fourth in as many games since returning from an injury last season.
“They worked harder than us. They had a lot more energy,” head coach Maura Crowell said. “They battled harder. They came to get to the loose pucks, and we weren’t getting any bounces. The puck was bouncing off our sticks and over our sticks. You work for that sort of luck and they were rewarded for it.”
The second goal for the Bulldogs came midway through the second period from sophomore defenseman Kate Martini. Yale had possession in the Harvard zone when Martini received a pass at the blue line and beat Maschmeyer.
Along with strong offense, the Bulldogs were backed up by the strong performance of junior goalie Jaimie Leonoff who had 29 saves in the contest. The Yale defense followed Leonoff’s model, playing strong throughout all three periods, including five penalty kills, three of which they did not allow a single shot. Leonoff is only the second Bulldog goalie to ever shut out the Crimson.
Harvard is no stranger to being behind. Just this past week against the University and Connecticut, the women were able to overcome a late deficit with the help of back-to-back goals from Elizabeth Parker and Sarah Edney. Against the fellow Connecticut competitor of Yale, however, they experienced a different fate.
Hillary Crowe and sophomore Miye D’Oench led the Crimson offense with six and five shots on goal respectively, although neither was able to connect. The team as a whole made offensive adjustments between periods, but it couldn’t get the puck in the net.
“You change your offensive attack when you’re behind two goals late in the game so just putting more pressure on them and trying to come up with loose pucks and put pucks to net,” Crowell said.
There is still plenty of hockey left in the season, so Crowell is looking for the team to use this loss as a motivator and not let it happen again.
“We have to work a lot harder… and not look past any teams and not assume anything about any teams based on their records,” Crowell said. “We’ve done a good job of that this year just taking it day by day. We let them get away with one yesterday and we are certainly not going to let anyone else do that.”
The team faces Colgate next weekend as it continue ECAC play. Last time the two teams met Harvard defeated the Raiders with a final score of 2-0 with strong performances from freshman goalie Brianna Laing, freshman defense Natasha Rachlin, and freshman forward Sydney Daniels.
“We had a lot of shots on net, but we didn’t play as well as we could have,” freshman defenseman Robyn White said. “We are going to come back next weekend and definitely play better.”
The loss was its first shutout of the season, though the team typically averages 2.75 goals per game and is used to winning by a margin of at least two, with only three of its wins being within one goal.
“I think Yale was better than us yesterday,” Crowell said. “They wanted it more and they got rewarded for that. Unfortunately we weren’t able to put up 60 minutes of hockey. We got behind and never really got back into it. They were better than us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
After falling behind 3-0 after three games, the Harvard women’s squash team looked likely to suffer its first loss of the season this Sunday. 
But the Crimson (6-0, 3-0 Ivy), ranked No. 1 in the country, was quick to put the tough start behind it, winning the remaining six matches to oust conference rival No. 5 Penn (4-1, 1-1 Ivy) on Sunday. The 6-3 win at the Murr Center extended Harvard’s winning streak and preserved its undefeated record.
“I think that it was a great match overall,” junior co-captain Haley Mendez said. “We got off to a little bit of a rocky start, losing the first three matches. But it turned around from there.”
Junior Amanda Sobhy, who last year was named best overall player by the Dunlop Women’s College Squash Association, was part of the turnaround for the Crimson. She only let her opponent score 14 points throughout the entire match, winning in straight sets, 11-6, 11-3, 11-5, over freshman Anaka Alankamony, the Quakers’ number one-seeded player.
“It was really up to the girls that still had to go on to … put that behind us and really focus in on their own matches,” Mendez said. “[They had to] not worry about what was happening on the other courts.”
At an important juncture in the match, with Harvard trailing, 3-1, Mendez won a critical match against sophomore Yan Xin Tan, who finished fourth in the Dunlop Women's College Squash Association Individual Rankings last season. Despite a small hiccup in losing her second set, the co-captain pulled off the win, 11-9, 12-14, 11-7, 11-3.
“I was not the favorite going in,” Mendez said. “But I was able to stick to my game plan pretty well and I think I played some of the best squash I’ve played all season. I was happy to pull out the win for the team.”
The Crimson did not let up once it erased the three-match deficit. After pulling ahead, 4-3, Harvard just needed one win in its last two matches to pull off the victory. The Crimson did not leave any doubt, however, winning the remaining two matches to ensure the victory.
“Our goal was to not let them play their games, to not get stuck in their games and focus on our strengths,” Mendez said.
Despite losing her first set, sophomore Isabelle Dowling came back in the next three sets to ensure a key victory for Harvard. Sophomore Saumya Karki and freshman Dileas MacGowan – the fourth and seventh seeded Crimson competitors, respectively – both won in five sets in what proved to be critical matches.
“I was pretty confident [headed into the fifth set],” Karki said. “I believed I was a better player [than opponent Haidi Lala], that I was fitter and that she was more flustered than I was.”
The hot start in the match from Penn was indicative of the team’s success early this season. The loss is the first this year for the Quakers. The team had only lost one individual match the entire season, in a November 24th matchup against George Washington.
“Penn is a really strong team this year,” Mendez said. “They have a lot of new international freshmen that are playing very well for them.”
Freshman Michelle Wong of Malaysia provided Penn with one of its three match wins on the afternoon, defeating Harvard junior Julianne Chu in four sets. Seniors Chloe Blacker and Courtney Jones accounted for the Quakers’ other two wins.
“They were tough matches,” Karki said. “There was just one matchup that was one-sided. Everyone showed a lot of toughness. I thought that we were a much fitter team than them and more willing to fight for the points.”
The win over the Quakers concluded what was an impressive overall performance this weekend for the Crimson, taking down two ranked teams in Penn and No. 4 Princeton on back-to-back days.
“I think everyone just stayed really focused and put in a lot of effort and a lot of heart,” Karki said.
The Crimson has not lost a match in 363 days. Harvard has been even more impressive at home, remaining unbeaten at the Murr Center since February 12th, 2011 at the hands of archrival Yale. But despite these impressive winning streaks, the team was solely focused on celebrating the most recent win.
“The pressure was off of us,” Mendez said. “We weren’t expecting to win. But we knew that we are extremely fit, we’ve been working really hard, and we were prepared."

 With the beloved Shake Shack recently opened up next to Yogurtland and Insomnia Cookies around the corner, Harvard Square seems to have already become the promised land for all things sweet and loved in the Boston area. One thing, however, has remained missing, something that only the North End has been able offer: Mike’s Pastry.
But the North End may not be able to compete with Harvard Square for much longer, now that reports show that Mike’s Pastry has filed a permit with the City of Cambridge to open second location at 11 Dunster Street—another cannoli heaven might be opening in the heart of the Square. The late-night dilemma of cookies or burgers could now be further conflicted, as Mike’s cannolis would surely add to the mix.
 For most Harvard undergraduates, the trek for a Mike’s cannoli will surely be minimized if the store does open on Dunster Street. As for those in the Quad, who knows—the trip might take just as long.
