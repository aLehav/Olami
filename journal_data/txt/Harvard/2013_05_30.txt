After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though the Harvard women’s cross country team lost its two top runners from the year before to graduation, the team showed little signs of needing to rebuild in 2012.
Despite the graduation of Kailyn Kuzmuk and Nicole Cochran, top-10 finishers from the HYP meet the year before, Harvard placed fourth overall at the NCAA Northeast Regionals meet on the backs of five seemingly even runners. With the performance, the Crimson earned a bid to the national event. The next week the Crimson women toed the line against the nation’s best teams at this season’s NCAA Championships for the first time in 30 years.
Though the team finished in last place out of the 31 qualifying teams, advancing to the meet represents a significant improvement for the Crimson women, who were sixth in the Ivy League last season and had not qualified for the Championships since 1983.
“To get to that level is quite a feat and is just a testament to their dedication and their work ethic,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “They set their sights right from the beginning of the year on making it to nationals.”
Senior Sammy Silva, juniors Morgan Kelly and Emily Reese, team co-captain, and sophomores Alaina Alvarez and Viviana Hanley turned in impressive performances all year for Harvard. They were consistently the team’s top-five runners, but the order in which they crossed the finish line was almost never the same from one meet to the next.
At the Heptagonal Championships, Silva led the way for the Crimson. At regionals just over a week later, Reese was the team’s first runner, and the next weekend Hanley took over, finishing in 118th place at nationals.
“It makes a tremendous difference when you have interchangeable parts,” Saretsky said. “If someone had an off day, someone was right there ready to step up.... We might not have the frontrunners of some of the other teams, but we have some really, really strong runners that, on any given day, can be right up there.”
In a sharp contrast to the women’s squad, the same pair of runners led the Harvard men all season long. Juniors Maksim Korolev and James Leakos bounced back from the injuries that kept them from competing in the 2011 Heptagonal Championships and returned to form in 2012.
After a disappointing showing at Heps, the duo had their best outing of the season  at regionals on Nov. 9, where Korolev and Leakos placed second and fifth, respectively, out of 239 runners. Though the men’s team would only finish sixth in the team standings at the meet, the stellar finishes of Korolev and Leakos allowed them to both advance to nationals.
The junior standouts joined Kelly, Reese, Silva, Alvarez, and Hanley at the national championship meet in Louisville, Ky. In spite of their impressive displays at regionals, however, Korolev and Leakos did not have the same success at nationals. While Korolev finished the 10k in an uncharacteristically slow 31:43.8, Leakos did not complete the race.
“Conditions were not exactly ideal for us going into that race, but I think we let the big stage get into our heads a little more than we had ought to,” Leakos said. “Next time we’ll have that experience with us and can be prepared.”
“For the men, the pieces are all there and it’s just about putting it all together,” Saretsky added. “It didn’t quite click for the men, but...it was a season of learning.”
The men’s and women’s teams kicked off their seasons in different fashions. In this year’s Harvard-Yale dual meet, which took place on the second weekend of the season, the Crimson men earned a resounding win over the Bulldogs, amassing 21 points to the 38 of the Bulldogs. Korolev and Leakos led the charge, taking home the top two finishing spots in the eight-kilometer race, crossing the finish line with respective times of 24:20.39 and 24:22.00.
“We’d put together some consistent training and were simply in great shape,” Leakos said. “We put ourselves at the front and ran strong as others fell off.”
On the women’s side, Yale trounced Harvard, 40-19, by placing its six top runners in the race’s top seven places. Silva was the only Crimson runner to break the top seven, earning second place by covering the five-kilometer course in 17:25.58. Rounding out the top 10, however, were Reese, senior Brianna Jackucewicz, and Kelly.
In spite of the early-season loss, Harvard toppled the Bulldogs at Heps, scoring 93 points to Yale’s 108 to earn third place. Silva was the only Crimson runner that finished in the top 15, taking home sixth place.
“It was really all about performing the best when it came to championship time, and that’s absolutely what happened,” Saretsky said. “Now that they have a taste of being in the big dance and running at that level, I think they have a sense that they belong there. Now it’s not just about getting there, it’s about doing some damage once they’re there.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
When sophomore center Kenyatta Smith walked off the court in Salt Lake City for the final time this season, he did so with his head held high.
 
In a game where Harvard basketball’s top scoring duo was held to a combined 14 points and the Crimson’s offense seemed powerless, Smith stepped up.
 
The Crimson’s season came to a close with a 23-point loss to Arizona in the third round of the NCAA tournament, but Smith wrapped up his season with a team-high 10 points and three steals.
 
“We knew we needed something, and he delivered,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “He delivered more than anyone could have imagined.”
 
Smith—a three-star recruit who was the No. 13 center in his class according to scout.com—was coming off a disappointing freshman year in which he saw limited playing time and put up three points in eight games. At the start of the 2013 season, Smith was tapped to start in the first five games. He averaged 5.4 points per game and found himself on the bench for the next 16 games in favor of classmates Steve Moundou-Missi and Jonah Travis.
 
But everything changed in February.
 
Coming off a road loss to Columbia that knocked Harvard out of sole ownership of first place in the Ivy League, Amaker decided to shake up his starting lineup going into the make-or-break home weekend against Penn and Princeton at Lavietes Pavilion.
 
After playing less than 20 minutes in each of his previous 16 games, the 6’8” center was a unstoppable in the paint, putting up 20 points on eight-for-nine shooting from the field. Smith obliterated the program record for single-game blocks with 10 and grabbed nine rebounds, finishing one rebound away from a Harvard’s first-ever triple-double.
 
The next night against rival Princeton, Smith followed up Friday’s performance with 14 points on perfect shooting from the field and the line, adding seven rebounds and six blocks.
 
Smith would not match his Penn-Princeton performance again as the season wound down, but he started every game and provided a much-needed spark on the interior.
 
Smith emerged as the Crimson’s most consistent performer in the tournament, scoring 10 points in each game and making key defensive plays that energized Harvard down the stretch in its historic win over New Mexico in the second round.
 
“This was his time,” Amaker said. “This was why I recruited him, to be this kind of player. It was time for him to do that, to step forward and to make his presence felt.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In addition to the six million items stored on-site at Widener Library, at least 100 titles are delivered each morning to the area behind the circulation desk. Most of them I’ve never read and probably never will. Yet as a function of my term-time job, two days a week, each of these books passes through my hands.
The process is a rather humbling one because it’s an implicit rethinking of what they told you when you received that Harvard acceptance one spring day four years ago. They told you that you had successfully memorized enough vocabulary words and math facts to last a lifetime—or something like that.
The reality is, in the grand spectrum of things, we know very little. And that’s ok.
Goethe once wrote, “The highest thing a man can attain is to marvel.” In other words, the greatest knowledge is that knowledge itself is unfathomably vast.
Ulysses, as described by Tennyson, echoes this idea in his attempt “to follow knowledge like a sinking star, beyond the utmost bound of human thought.”
It is the quest for knowledge, and not the possession of it, that motivates the true student. Like Ulysses’ sinking star, it will always elude more than a split second’s grasp as the human eye chases it. Or maybe the student is the star, compelled unendingly toward the unknown. No one knows for sure.
But I do know this: I’ve learned more from my interactions with all of you—on the field, courtside, in the Sports Cube, in the middle of Weeks Footbridge, in a booth at the Kong—than I have from any class here, and that includes CS50. That’s not to say I haven’t learned a lot from four years of course instruction. But I do believe that our relationships are what make a place like Harvard so special—what makes it possible to be wiser now than we were four years ago. In short, we can take comfort in the fact that our collective knowledge is much greater than that of any individual. That someone out there actively requested to read that book you’ve never seen before.
Along those lines, the main thing I will take away from my Harvard education is an increased capacity for wonder. That, and an unequivocal gratitude for the time I’ve been able to spend learning from each of my teammates (in all senses of the word).
At this point, you’re probably wondering why I have yet to mention a single sporting event, given that my two main activities on campus—varsity soccer and The Crimson’s sports board—have everything to do with athletics.
You’re right to question me there. If I were to add up all the hours I dedicated in some capacity to college sports and compare that number to any other relevant one (including hours slept), the results would border on comedy.
The fact is, most of the moments that lead me to marvel at this university are, at least in some way, related to athletics.
Christian Webster and Laurent Rivard embrace in the conference room on the second floor of Lavietes Pavilion after they learn of Princeton’s loss to Brown, securing the outright conference championship.
Six sports editors gather on the roof to watch the sunrise after sending last year’s Commencement Issue to the presses.
An ecstatic and somewhat frantic coach Ray Leone jumps into the Charles River after a victory clinches our most recent Ivy League title.
The late Joe Walsh smiles in a way only he can and launches into a descriptive analysis of the entire baseball game just played, without being asked a single question.
A group of young women belt out Beyonce’s “Halo” on the bus ride home from Columbia.
All those times our campus “believe[d] that we will win.”
In short, the entire college experience is reason to marvel—especially those moments we earn in the wake of time spent giving ourselves over to the good of a collective cause.
And while our time at Harvard is finite, opportunities to pursue knowledge abound. Even as we leave this place to do whatever we’ve chosen, we are blessed with innumerable possibilities. There’s really no telling where any of us will be in 20 years, which of the countless books we’ll decide to read. And that is something worth celebrating.
Since we’ve reached the end of my allotted word count—and our time at Harvard—I’ll leave you with a piece of one of my favorite childhood stories. It seems to fit here, given that, for me, it served as a sort of beginning.
“Take a farewell look at the waves and the sky,” writes Robert McCloskey. “Take a farewell sniff of the salty sea. A little bit sad about the place you are leaving, a little bit glad about the place you are going.”
As college students and as graduating seniors, we have reached that “Time of Wonder.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When it comes to skiing, some days on the hill are better than others. So went the season for the Harvard ski team, a young team that failed to reach previously achieved levels of national prominence but experienced various individual successes.
Junior co-captain Rebecca Nadler, who won the national title in the giant slalom in 2012, was the team’s lone representative in the NCAA Championships, marking the first time in three years that only one Crimson skier made the trip to nationals. Despite a late-season injury, she competed in both the giant slalom and the slalom but was unable to defend her title in the giant slalom, instead placing 18th. Nadler finished 23rd in the slalom.
Although Harvard entered the last race of the season, the EISA Championships, with four Nordic skiers with a chance at reaching the NCAA Championships, none of them qualified. Co-captain Alena Tofte had qualified for nationals the previous two seasons.
Despite not having anybody reach the national finals, Nordic coach Chris City ’94 was encouraged by the progress his team made.
“It’s certainly disappointing to not qualify anyone,” City said. “It was wrenching to come so close this year with so many athletes and not have anyone quite make it. At the same time, I’m proud of the depth we’re building.”
The Nordic team’s season was marked by several strong individual performances. Junior Chris Stock placed in the top 15 on four consecutive weekends, and sophomore Akeo Maifeld-Carucci raced to his first ever top-10 finish at the Colby Carnival.
Co-captain Anthony Ryerson posted a 41st-place finish in the 10K Classic at EISA Championships and just missed qualifying for NCAAs.
Despite losing out on nationals, the team had an otherwise successful season.
“The men’s team turned in the best performances we’ve had from our men’s team in over 15 years,” City said. “Our fourth-place finish at the St. Lawrence Carnival was our best men’s team finish in many years.”
On the women’s side, freshmen Emily Hanna, Annie Harvieux, Hanna Barnes, and Soren Anderson all made their mark alongside Tofte. Hanna paced the women’s team in many races, including a 10th-place finish in her first-ever college race at the Vermont Carnival.
The alpine team had some success but had difficulty breaking into the upper reaches of the standings due to its youth, particularly on the men’s side.
Because of the team’s youth and inexperience, the freshmen had to combat poor starting positions to finish. With more races under their belts, the skiers can accrue more international ranking points and improve their starting spots.
“Four out of the six male racers who would be competing were freshmen,” freshman Matthew Mansson said. “We didn’t have any points on the college tour, so we were all battling from the back of the pack trying to beat the odds and score some points for the team.”
Nonetheless, there were some bright spots for the alpine skiers. Freshman Simon Merryweather notched third-place finishes in both the slalom and the giant slalom at the Vermont Carnival, and co-captain Andrew Spielvogel earned fifth place in the giant slalom and sixth in the slalom at the same event.
Nadler may not have been able to defend her title in the giant slalom but still had a successful season, highlighted by a tie for first place in the giant slalom at EISA Championships. Senior Catherine Sheils, who qualified for NCAAs in 2011, had a season-best 23rd-place finish in the giant slalom at the Middlebury Carnival.
“Looking back on the season, we definitely outperformed all expectations,” Mansson said. “Thanks to some great mentoring from our captains Becca Nadler and Andrew Spielvogel, the team had a good season.”
Because of the youth of both the alpine and Nordic squads, City notes that the future appears bright, as the alpine skiers improve their starting positions and the Nordic skiers continue to progress.
“We have several exciting freshmen coming in next year, including one who was a multiple All-American at the junior level,” City said. “I’ll be looking for leading performances from my sophomores, juniors, and seniors. With the depth we showed, I’m confident that we’ll be back at NCAAs next year and for years to come.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s golf team started and ended its 2012-13 campaign in the exact same place: on top of the Ivy League.
The squad won its second straight Ancient Eight title this spring despite battling injuries with a roster of just five golfers all season. Despite the difficulties presented this season, the young team proved itself dominant in the conference, from the Yale Women’s Intercollegiate Tournament in September to the Ivy League Championship in April.
“As it was, the five that were playing were the five that were very likely to have traveled to every tournament,” Crimson coach Kevin Rhoads said. “Those five–it’s probably the strongest, most talented five that we’ve had in my time coaching the team.”
This season represented a transition for the Harvard golf program as Rhoads pulled double duty, taking the reins of the men’s program in addition to leading the women through his ninth season with the team. Lending a hand to the women’s team was Claire Sheldon ’10, a Crimson golf alum and three-time All-Ivy player.
“Whenever there’s transition you wonder at first if it will affect the teams in a good way or a bad way,” Rhoads said. “The good was certainly evident, and what Claire brought to the women’s team was fantastic.”
Freshman Christine Lin gathered the Crimson’s fourth Ivy League Rookie of the Year award. Lin’s performance at the league tournament allowed Harvard to take the title by just one stroke, the smallest margin of victory in the tournament since 1998.
“I think that having the emotional connection brought us closer to achieving our team and individual goals,” Lin said. “I actually think our team chemistry is why we did so well this season. I thought it was really working for us [all season].”
Early tournaments revealed the talent of a young team that consisted of four underclassmen and one junior. The Crimson landed itself on the podium in the first invitational of the year, taking third in New Haven, Conn., at the Yale Intercollegiate tournament on Sept. 23. Just a week later, the team set the program record for the lowest single round of 18 holes with a four-under-par 284 in State College, Penn., at the Nittany Lion Invitational, where Harvard placed second in a field of 17.
“That was a big turning point and a big breakthrough for our team, especially since we’re only five girls, and we all know we can shoot really low,” Lin said of the performance.
A 14th-place finish at the Stanford Invitational in October earned the team its highest-ever ranking, No. 45 in the nation.
While the fall saw the team compete somewhat seamlessly despite the small size of the group, in the spring, the game started to take an evident physical toll on the players.
Sophomore Brenna Nelsen, who is also a Crimson sports editor, and junior captain Bonnie Hu, who is also a Crimson business editor, managed injuries that prevented them from following a full practice regimen during the week. Despite these setbacks, the team continued to perform on a high level, taking third in the Brown Invitational on April 27.
“We were all supportive of each other during times of difficulty,” Lin said. “I think that’s made us stronger, and it worked out really well.”
The team received its final Ancient Eight test before conference championships at the two-round Brown BEAR Invitational on April 14-15. Harvard shot 16 above Yale’s season-best round of 295 for a third-place finish.
“We obviously wanted to win, but Yale beat us pretty bad,” Lin said. “It was like a wake-up call, and it showed us that a lot of other teams were working really hard for Ivy’s, too, and that we really needed to pick it up in the next week.”
The wake-up call was answered as Lin took second place in the Ivy individual competition after a single-hole playoff with Princeton’s Kelly Shon. Her score of 221 put Harvard ahead of Princeton by one stroke, 909-910, to take the Ivy trophy. The win gave the Crimson an automatic berth for the NCAA regionals at Stanford, where the team ended its season with a 20th-place finish in a the field of 24.
“In the face of all the distraction, to come out on top and win our second Ivy League championship in a row and our fourth in six years, I’m just extremely proud of the team,” Rhoads said. “They’ve overcome more than any other team has had to, and they came out on top.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s water polo team had a rollercoaster ride of a season, going through both a nine-game winning streak and a nine-game losing streak on its way to a 15-19 record and a seventh-place finish in the Collegiate Water Polo Association Eastern Tournament in what was largely a rebuilding year for the Crimson.
“When you step back and consider that we graduated a class of five major contributors last year, we did quite well,” junior co-captain Will Roller said. “Our team was able to quickly integrate a class of seven freshmen and finish with a solid record.”
After starting the season just 3-5, the Crimson began to play some of the best water polo in Harvard’s history, winning nine games in just over two weeks and jumping out to a 12-5 record. The streak was the team’s longest since the 2002 season, when it won nine straight as well.
“We started doing a better job of understanding what we were trying to accomplish in the pool,” Crimson coach Ted Minnis said. “By the time we got into the middle of the season we were really playing Harvard water polo, and our guys understood what we were trying to do.”
But the streak came to an end in a close match against then-no. 14 Bucknell on Sept. 30, when Harvard dropped the second match of a doubleheader and proceeded to fall into a slump. The next week, the team traveled to California, where it faced some stiff competition that overwhelmed the Crimson.
Over the course of three days, Harvard lost five straight matches to California schools by an average margin of over six goals. Over this stretch, the team played against teams that would ultimately finish ranked fifth, seventh, and 13th in the CWPA poll.
Upon returning to the East Coast, Harvard fell to No. 16 Brown, No. 9 St. Francis, and No. 17 Mercyhurst in quick succession before heading into the Ivy League Championships.
“We hit a really tough stretch there in the last third of the season,” Minnis said. “We played some really quality games against some quality teams, but we finished strong.”
The Crimson managed to temporarily right the ship in the postseason, beating Penn in the first round but falling to Brown in the second game. The team lost to rival MIT, 15-14, in overtime during the Northern Division Championships, but came back to beat the Engineers in the final match of the season and finished seventh in the CWPA Eastern Tournament.
This was one of Harvard’s best seasons in years, as the team’s .441 winning percentage was its highest since 2007, but the Crimson is still looking to improve next year. Harvard loses only two seniors this year and returns seven highly talented rising sophomores.
“With seven players [in the freshman] class, everyone had to adapt to new roles,” Roller said. “Our leading scorer from the 2011 season and my co-captain, [senior] Max Eliot, willingly adopted a new role in the pool that didn’t necessarily benefit his personal statistics, but was in the best interest of the team.”
Eliot and his fellow senior, attacker Antone Martinho, will depart next year, but while the team will lose veteran leadership in 2013, it will look to improve nonetheless as its celebrated freshmen class continues to develop.
This year, Harvard’s top three leading scorers were freshmen, and its top eight scorers will be returning for next season. The Crimson will look for these players to continue to step up and lead in the pool next year.
“There are impact players,” Roller said. “But I think it’s better to describe them as an impact class. I could not have been more proud of all of the freshmen. They brought speed, energy, and an attitude that enabled us to do so well, and will allow us to continue doing well going forward. I am eager to see what we can do next year, but also how the program develops as this class moves through it.”
“I think next year we are looking to be playing in the championship game at our Northern League championship,” the co-captain added. “This is very achievable with the existing team and when you consider the new freshman that will be joining our program next year, I am very confident that you will be seeing even more improvement from us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the course of a single season, the Harvard women’s water polo team took on some of the best competition in the nation, finished above .500 for just the second time in eight years, and placed sixth out of 12 teams in the CWPA Eastern Championship.
All 10 players on the roster played significant minutes throughout the year, and the Crimson’s 18 wins were its most since 2005.
“I think we had a really great season, and this is one of the [most fun] teams I’ve ever been on,” junior attacker Shayna Price said. “Everyone was so close this year, and with 10  girls playing, it was like playing with your best friends every day, and it was so much fun. There was a lot of heart and love in this season.”
The team played its best water polo of the year in the weeks spanning from late February to early March when the Crimson won eight straight games to improve its record to 13-4. The streak was Harvard’s longest since 2000.
The most exciting game within that stretch was the seventh win, which came against Santa Clara. The Crimson scored three goals in the fourth period and sophomore goalie Ariel Dukes came up with two saves in the final minute of play to secure the victory.
Harvard’s season included a trip to California during spring break that saw the Crimson take on some of the top competition from around the nation, including No. 18 UC Davis, No. 2 Stanford, and No. 5 California. The team posted a 3-5 record on the week.
Harvard also battled No. 9 Princeton twice, losing both times.
At times, the Crimson offense seemed to have no trouble putting points on the board. It scored more than 17 goals five times this year, and its largest margin of victory was 15 in a win over Villanova in early February.
Against tougher competition in California, goals were harder to come by. In each of the last five games of its trip west, Harvard was held to fewer than 10 goals in five straight losses.
“We got to learn a lot from these bigger teams who we never really play,” sophomore attacker Victoria Frager said. “They have a lot of skill, and we don’t always see such stacked teams. It was good to go in and realize that we needed to play all four quarters and attack it all the time.”
Harvard’s final tournament of the season took place in Ann Arbor, Mich., at the CWPA Eastern Championships. The Crimson finished sixth for the third time in program history.
“I was concerned when the season started that everyone was [not] going to be able to play,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “But they came every day, worked their butts off, and worked for themselves and worked for the program, so I was very, very happy with this group.”
Co-captain Aisha Price provided a consistent source of offense for the Crimson all season long. Price amassed team-highs with 79 goals, 45 assists, and 72 steals to earn CWPA Southern Division first-team honors.
“Aisha’s done a great job this year cwpa us,” Minnis said. “She started the last three years for me. She’s very athletic; she does a very good job swimming the pool. She’s very quick and explosive on the defensive end, and she shoots the ball really well. She’s done a really great job for us all year and has been a great leader.”
Other top contributors included junior attacker Shayna Price, who finished just three goals shy of her sister’s 79. Freshman attacker Charlotte Hendrix scored 71 goals and ranked second on the team with 42 assists and 57 steals.
Dukes anchored the team all season in goal and racked up 246 saves.
Harvard had a relatively small team this season, and Minnis said that his players probably played more minutes than any other team in the country. With a roster of only 10 players, the Crimson relied on endurance and consistent production all year long.
“The biggest thing is that we have such a small team, and everyone needs to be accountable for how they play in the game, and to do that, we have to work hard in practices,” Aisha Price said. “It’s so nice to see how much everyone improves and rises to the opportunity.”

Brother took on brother in the final match of Ivy League Championships at the Gordon Indoor Track.
With the score all tied up, freshman foilist Jerry Chang defeated Penn sophomore Jason Chang to clinch the Ivy League title for the Harvard men’s fencing team.
“It was just so close,” freshman Duncan O’Brien said. “That was probably the most exciting moment in sports I’ve ever experienced, and I’ve been a Boston sports fan my whole life.”
In the same tournament, the women’s team failed to come away with the win and finished third behind Princeton and Columbia.
The Crimson qualified 11 fencers for the NCAA Championships—one fewer than in 2012. Only sophomore epee fencer Peregrine Badger won an individual medal, picking up the bronze and first team All-American honors.
“I don’t know if it could have been much better individually,” Badger said. “All the tournaments I tried to peak for I did, so I’m very satisfied.”
Badger improved on his sixth-place 2012 finish, winning 17 of 23 qualifying bouts and facing future national champion Marco Canveri from Ohio State in the semifinals. Although he mounted a comeback at the end of the match, Badger could not overcome an early deficit and missed out on a spot in the championship round.
The men’s side picked up two more top-10 finishes in the foil but struggled in the epee and the saber, winning no more than 13 bouts in either event.
For the women, junior co-captain Alexandra Kiefer finished just out of medal contention after dropping a qualifying match to her younger sister Lee Kiefer, a freshman at Notre Dame, who went on to win the gold medal in the event.
“Our ultimate goal is to win NCAA championships,” Badger said. “We fell short this year, but I think that just leaves room for improvement next year.”
Both teams kicked off their season at the Garret Penn State Open where junior epee fencer Michael Raynis had the only first-place finish for the Crimson. Keifer led the women with a second-place finish in the foil.
At Vassar, both sides went 4-1 and again benefited from strong performances by Raynis and Keifer. Freshman Nina van Loon matched Keifer with a 14-1 record, and O’Brien, a walk-on, went 4-1 in his first collegiate competition.
“It was such a great decision to walk on,” O’Brien said. “I was immediately welcomed at the beginning of the year, and it’s such a small team and a close knit group of guys.”
Van Loon and O’Brien were part of a strong freshman class, which was key in a number of the Crimson’s victories. Freshman sabreur Aliya Itzkowitz placed 12th at NCAA championships and earned second team All-Ivy honors and an All-American honorable mention. Foilist and classmate Michael Woo was named to the All-Ivy first team after going 13-2 at Ivy League Championships and winning a bronze medal at NCAA Regionals.
“The freshmen are some of our top players,” Badger said. “They get very good in high school and have been traveling to World Cups since they were very young. They’re freshmen at Harvard, but they’re on an incredible upward trajectory in the world rankings.”
Though both teams would go on to make strong showings in the conference championships, they got of the season. Harvard travelled to Queens, New York to participate in the St. John’s Invitational to begin 2013 and went 1-4 overall. The women’s team failed to pick up a win against any of its first five opponents, even as Kiefer went 13-2 individually, the strongest Crimson performance.
With only one tournament left until the Ancient Eight championships, Harvard redeemed itself with three wins on each side in the Beanpot, sweeping MIT, Brandeis, and Boston College. Kiefer posted a perfect 9-0 record on the women’s side, and Michael Woo went undefeated on the men’s side.
Before the Crimson advanced to NCAA Championships, it returned to Queens to compete in regionals. Sophomore Brian Kaneshige won the gold medal in the foil—one of three for the men—and Kiefer and sophomore Emma Vaggo took home bronze medals in the foil and the epee, respectively. The women also earned a pair of top-ten finishes in the sabre competition.
Badger credited his captains, juniors Raynis and Lucas Lin, with creating a supportive atmosphere, which allowed the team to be more cohesive and competitive.
“The captains did a really good job of solidifying team culture and making the team a very fun experience,” Badger said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s going to take some time to make the necessary changes to the Harvard track and field record board this offseason.
Breaking a number of school records and earning its first Ivy League championship in 13 years, the Crimson’s 2013 campaign was one of the best in recent memory. At this year’s Indoor Heptagonal Championships, the Harvard women rose to the occasion and pulled off an unexpected victory over their Ancient Eight opponents, capturing Harvard’s first Heps title since 2000. The Crimson men had a similarly impressive Indoor Heps; the team’s third-place finish was the best for Harvard since 1985.
“We’re just in a really good place right now in Harvard history,” junior co-captain Adabelle Ekechukwu said. “We’re becoming a very legitimate program, which has just been shown by the success that we’ve had both individually and as a team throughout the year.”
Ekechukwu, who was honored as the Most Outstanding Performer at Indoor Heps, was dominant for the Crimson throughout the indoor season. The junior, who is also a Crimson arts and multimedia editor, broke the Ivy League record in the weight throw with a heave of 20.83 meters. Her nearest competitor at Heps, Princeton’s Julia Ratcliffe, set the Ivy record in the event at the beginning of the season but was over two full meters short of the record-breaking toss.
“We had been working towards [an Ivy championship] since the fall,” Ekechukwu said. “The seniors had been pushing for it for four years, my year had been pushing for it for three years, and it definitely brought the team together. I think our close relationship really pushed us to achieve that goal.”
The junior was one of three members of the women’s squad who qualified for the NCAA Indoor Championships this season. Along with freshman multi-event athlete Martina Salander and sophomore middle distance runner Erika Veidis, Ekechukwu was recognized as an All-American for her 12th-place finish. Veidis competed in the 800-meter run and finished in 10th place with a time of 2:06.69.
“All three of them put their names on our school record board,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “All three are underclassmen and will be back again next year. For them to get a taste of competition at that level [and see] that they belong is really what our program is all about.”
The most impressive performance of the championship weekend came from Salander in the pentathlon. The rookie from Stockholm, Sweden, racked up an Ancient Eight record 4,209 points in the event en route to a fifth-place finish. She was the only freshman in the country to qualify for the pentathlon event.
“I think the trip to Arkansas was a really good experience for all three of us,” Ekechukwu said. “Even though none of us placed in the top three, I think it was definitely a stepping stone for what we’re going to try to accomplish next year. For me personally, it taught me how to compete at the highest level.”
While Salander was one of the team’s top performers during the indoor season, classmate Autumne Franklin took the helm down the stretch as competition moved outdoors. The rookie was a force in the hurdles, taking home first and second place at Outdoor Heps in the 100- and 400-meter hurdles, respectively. Senior Mary Hirst also turned in the best performance of her career at the meet, winning both the heptathlon and high jump to receive the Most Outstanding Female Field Performer distinction.
On the men’s side, the perennially strong throwing corps had success this season. Junior Dustin Brode and sophomores Ben Glauser and Igor Liokumovich chipped in a majority of the squad’s points at Outdoor Heps, where Harvard finished in fifth place. Brode finished in second place in the shot put with a mark of 18.20 meters. Brode’s performance was the then-best in school history, topping the previous record in the event set in 1969.
The trio of throwers were among 18 Harvard athletes to qualify for the NCAA Northeast Preliminaries on May 23. Brode heaved for a new personal best with a throw of 18.45 meters to land him in eighth place overall during the preliminary rounds.
“There’s just really a belief here that as a Harvard athlete you can be national-caliber, that you can be one of the best athletes in the nation,” Saretsky said. “Many of our point scorers are back again next year. There are a lot of things building, and [there is] a lot of momentum for the program.”

HEAVYWEIGHTS
With the NCAA Championships at the end of May, the Radcliffe heavyweight crews will row with something to prove.
“We had a really strong performance in all three events, the 1V8, 2V8 and varsity four [at Ivy League Championships],” heavyweight coach Liz O’Leary said. “In a conference where we’re competitive, that bodes well for us. You don’t ever want to jinx yourself, but I’m optimistic.”
After losing to Brown to start the spring season, the Black and White bounced back by taking down fifth-ranked Princeton and Cornell to claim the Class of 1975 Cup, showing that its crews could compete with the best in the nation.
But then Radcliffe hit a snag in its dual meet with Yale and Northeastern. A clashing of oars in the 1V8 race between the Black and White and the Bulldogs led to a controversial result. However, in the end, the officials upheld the original outcome, where the Yale boat edged the Radcliffe crew by 1.6 seconds.
Radcliffe’s second-ranked 2V8 crew suffered its only loss against the Tigers before the Black and White took on Ohio State. The Buckeyes’ top-ranked 2V8 crew handed Radcliffe’s 2V8 its second loss of the season before that boat, with a few lineup changes, claimed the silver medal at Ivy League Championships.
Although none of the boats entered in the Ivy Championships would come home carrying the gold medal, all six boats qualified for finals from the heats, and five of the six boats medaled in their final races, good enough for a second-place team finish behind Princeton.
“The heats are important because you want to be in the A final and also because anybody could qualify in any given event, so you have to be on your A game even for the morning heats, so I was happy that all of our boats did qualify,” O’Leary said. “Only four of the eight Ivies got all of their boats into the A finals, so that was the first level of success.”
Despite not repeating as Ivy champions, O’Leary is optimistic about the team’s chances at NCAA Championships after solid performances throughout the year.
“Over the course of the season, everybody figured out what it is to be competitive, nationally competitive, and worked hard to make changes,” O’Leary said. “I think one of our goals for the year was to have a strong team in all categories, and I feel very strongly that this team has risen to the occasion and done a good job all year long in training and training with that goal in mind.”
LIGHTWEIGHTS
After taking bronze at the Eastern Sprints in each of the last three years, the Radcliffe first varsity boat was ready for a change this season. A year after the second varsity boat took the first gold medal ever for the Black and White at Sprints, the top boat appeared to be ready to break to the top of the podium with its first undefeated season in over five years.
“You never know how fast your competitors are going to be, but within our own program, it was just a lot of hard work from sticking to the training plan we worked on last year that definitely got us faster,” said Emma Lukasiewicz, sixth seat of the 1V boat. “We won our first sprints medal in the [second] varsity eight last year, and it was really building off of that and getting a lot more base fitness and improving technique throughout the year that really got us where we ended up.”
Radcliffe entered the regatta ranked first in the nation and did not disappoint, outpacing second-place Princeton by over eight seconds in the varsity eight grand final to take home its first gold medal of the season in the title race. But the 1V’s gold medal was just the beginning of the hardware—both the 2V and 3V boats crossed the finish line first to sweep all of the varsity events.
“With rowing, it’s just a lot of hard work, and it’s really neat that it paid off for us, especially across all levels of the program, to have our novices have a good dual season and our three varsity boats winning Sprints,” Lukasiewicz said. “It was really neat to have that depth.”
The lightweights kicked off their year with an unprecedented start, winning the Head of the Charles for the first time ever. Later in the year, the crews picked up in the spring season right where they left off, dominating the Beanpot to begin the spring and continuing with a win over Georgetown.
The Black and White got the chance to showcase its speed at the Charles River Lightweight Invite, where then-No. 2 Radcliffe took on top-ranked Stanford. The 1V boat created an open-water lead over Stanford during the third 500 and held on to topple the reigning national champion and enter Eastern Sprints as the top-ranked crew.
Though the school year may be over, the Radcliffe lightweights have not yet finished their season. The crews head to Sacramento, Calif., on Friday to take on the Stanford Cardinals once again, this time with the rankings swapped, at the IRA National Championships.
“We knew that we had to stay focused because there’s a lot of good competition out there,” Lukasiewicz said. “We didn’t race against Stanford in Sprints, and they’re a really fast program. I think it’s a matter of staying focused and not getting complacent. Everyone’s definitely really excited, but it’s going to be a lot of work, and we’re looking forward to it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 28, 2014, at 1:55 a.m.
This article was originally published in The Crimson’s 2013 Commencement Year in Review issue last May. It is being reprinted as the first in a three-part series on mental health at Harvard and has been edited to reflect the passage of time since its original publication. Part II ran April 29 and Part III on April 30.
David was thriving at Harvard. In his time on campus, he had excelled in classes that he loved and pursued extracurricular activities about which he was passionate. When he was diagnosed with clinical depression in fall of 2012, he did not skip a beat, seeking treatment using mental health resources provided by Harvard University Health Services.
Yet despite taking advantage of all of these opportunities, David decided not to return to Harvard in the fall of 2013. He is taking a leave of absence from Harvard this academic year, in part to address mental health concerns.
“At Harvard we have everything that we could ever want to be happy, but we’re not quite,” David said. “And we think that perhaps if we could step out for a while, we might be able to figure out what that is and come back and be happy.”
In the past two years, the issue of emotional and psychological well-being has dominated discussions about student health at Harvard. At a student rally in Harvard Yard, a town hall discussion hosted by administrators, and in private settings, students have sought to grapple with the usual sources of pressure, as well as the added stressors of several undergraduate deaths, including two that administrators identified as suicides.
Again and again in these conversations, community members turn to the topic of going home for mental health reasons.
For a handful of students each year, Harvard’s environment is too much to bear. In search of wellness, these undergraduates leave Harvard, returning home to a world without the worries of college life. But before they go, students must navigate a complex and often stressful web of choices and procedures that at times are beyond their control.
AN INHOSPITABLE ENVIRONMENT
When My Ngoc To ’14-’15 was hospitalized at McLean Hospital for suicidal thoughts, she felt torn about whether or not to stay at school or take time off. If she decided to go home, UHS would require her to seek some form of care before returning to campus. To would also have to engage in a productive activity for a period of stability, which usually lasts six months. When she was ready to come back, she would have to meet with UHS for an intake interview and then petition the Administrative Board with proof that she was ready to return to life at Harvard.
“It was a hard decision to make,” said To, an inactive Crimson editorial editor. “My doctors definitely wanted me to go home, but my family didn’t quite understand what depression was.”
In the end, however, the pressures of life at Harvard outweighed the costs of going on leave.
“I felt like if I went back to school, it would have just been worse because it would have spiraled,” she said.
To is not alone. Students and administrators say they agree that the pace of Harvard life creates an atmosphere that can often be hostile to a student’s recovery from mental illness.
“This is not a place to get well—not because we don’t have the resources,” John “Jay” L. Ellison, the secretary of the Ad Board, said plainly. “It’s because to be a student here, you are pulling in problem sets. You’re writing papers.”
In many cases, students and administrators say the best option can be to take time off from school.
“Leaves offer a chance to press the reset button on a term so students can return at a later time and be better able to make the most of their time here,” said Sharon L. Howell, who works with students as the resident dean of Adams House.
Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde, who previously worked at Brown and Yale Universities, said that this environment is characteristic of many of Harvard’s peer institutions.
“There’s no selective university in the country that’s...a good place to get better,” he said. “I think for some students, they chose a too difficult selection of courses, but for others it’s the way they’re spending their time outside of the classroom.”
Howell said that a hectic lifestyle can directly impact a student’s recovery, as going to therapy is often seen as “one more thing they need to do.”
For David, who requested that his name be changed, this pace of life was one of the primary reasons that led him to take a leave of absence.
“Very often I would devote my time to extracurriculars and say to myself, ‘It’s okay that I’m not going to be happy today. It’s okay that I’m not doing what I want to today. I’m doing this because I want to be happy tomorrow,’” he said. “I think I realized that if I kept living like that, 30 years would go by before Irealized that tomorrow wasn’t going to be there.”
NOT GETTING BETTER
While students and administrators agree that Harvard’s atmosphere contributes to the problem, they sometimes disagree about whether UHS can fight that problem adequately.
UHS, which houses its Student Mental Health Services on the fourth floor of the Holyoke Center, is part of a broad network of mental health resources on campus, including peer counseling, the Student Mental Health Liaisons program, and wellness tutors in the Houses.
For some students, UHS is the symbol of an extensive system that despite its efforts cannot do enough to keep them healthy here on campus.
Emily, a College sophomore, chose to seek treatment for her mental health issues through UHS. When she decided to go home toward the end of last spring, she was both thankful that UHS professionals had spoken to her earlier about “navigating the system” and disappointed by the actual care she received.
“It felt like my issues weren’t being taken seriously because I wasn’t suicidal,” said Emily, who also requested a pseudonym.
David, too, was disappointed by the treatment he received through the University in the fall of 2012. After a few months, he switched to a private practitioner, a change he said was motivated in part by what he saw as lackluster care at UHS.
“My psychiatrist, for example, forgot my name two or three times. There were mix-ups related to prescriptions,” David said. “It was pretty clear that the people who were treating me were doing their best, but were overworked and not in the position to provide any quality care.”
In an emailed statement to The Crimson in May 2013, HUHS Director Paul J. Barreira and SMHS Chief Katherine A. Lapierre wrote that UHS is prepared to help with any “minor or serious, newly acquired, or long-standing” mental health concerns. And in a Crimson op-ed published in March 2013, Barriera wrote that many UHS patients said that “once they were in the system they felt that they received great care.”
In the op-ed, Barreira shared the results from three national leaders who conducted an outside review of SMHS, which found that “there is a perception that SMHS is not working solely for the administration.” This view that SMHS is responsive to students has led “the University community [to trust] that the SMHS is there for the care of students,” he continued.
But David expressed concern that UHS is not working solely for the student and sees itself also working for University administration.
“[HUHS has] to weigh on one hand the health and medical interests of the patient, but on the other hand the safety and liability concerns at the University,” David said, later saying that in his opinion UHS makes decisions “in a medical context for non-medical reasons” to safeguard Harvard from potential liability.
LOOMING LIABILITY
Lawsuits against universities have sparked controversy across the country over student suicides, including some against Harvard, MIT, Cornell, and Wesleyan.
The Harvard case surrounds the death of John B. Edwards III ’10, who was a sophomore interested in medicine and training to run the Boston Marathon when he committed suicide in November 2007. In his lawsuit, Edwards’ father contends that the treatment of his son by UHS did not meet medical standards.
In the midst of these lawsuits, Peter F. Lake ’81, a professor at Stetson University College of Law who specializes in higher education law, said that “liability is in the back of people’s minds” when students on campus are dealing with mental health issues.
Yet Ellison said that Harvard only considers “the behavior of the student” and that the risks of being held liable “never” play a role in the decision to send a student home.
Despite what Ellison says, Harvard faces significant legal risk at every step in the process while the student is still on campus. But everything changes when that student goes home.
“You stop the clock on liability when the student leaves,” said Michael A. Olivas, the director of the Institute of Higher Education Law and Governance at the University of Houston.
In particular, Harvard faces liability when it decides whether to forcibly send students home for mental health issues, Lake said.
These instances of involuntary leave rarely occur, however. At Harvard, as well as nationally, only a tiny percentage of students who go on leave for mental health reasons are forced out. Barreira and Lapierre wrote that in mental health cases, “the decision to take a [leave of absence] is the student’s to make, hopefully with the advice and counsel of mental health clinicians as well as their deans.”
In fact, as of 2013, only one student had been placed on an involuntary leave of absence from Harvard for mental health reasons in more than a decade, according to Ellison, and that student eventually asked to convert to a voluntary leave.
But when these cases do crop up, to avoid a lawsuit Harvard must never send someone home involuntarily if they are not dangerous to themselves or others, and it must always send them home if they are, said John Dayton a law professor at the University of Georgia and the director of the Education Law Consortium.
Still, Lake cautioned that it can often be a mistake to send home mentally ill students, even dangerous ones, to avoid liability.
“A very, very small number of people who exhibit mental health issues represent danger to themselves or others,” Lake said. “A lot of people who are potentially dangerous are actually better off with [the University] than off at home.”
CHOOSING THEIR OWN FATE?
Administrators often draw a clear line between voluntary and involuntary leaves of absence. But in fact, some students say that some voluntary leaves of absence are less voluntary than they seem.
Ellison acknowledged that there are times when students feel that circumstances have snowballed to a point at which they have “very little choice” but to go on voluntary leave. Ellison said that oftentimes students feel that taking a voluntary leave of absence is a better way to go.
“Even though they look the same [on a student’s record], students do feel like a voluntary [leave of absence] is the better choice,” Ellison said.
Emily decided to take leave from school in part because she was concerned that she would eventually be required to leave by the administration.
“I wanted to [take time off] on my own terms,” she said.
The school and mental health professionals can also encourage students to take time off, legal experts confirmed.
Even though she was not forced to leave the school, Emily said that doctors in UHS strongly recommended that she withdraw, significantly influencing her decision.
In addition, a loophole in the Student Handbook raises questions about involuntary leaves at Harvard. An obscure exam policy shows that Ellison’s claim that Harvard has only forcibly sent one person home for mental health reasons between at least 2002–2013 underreports the number of students whose mental health status has contributed to a mandated leave of absence.
In fact, Ellison acknowledges, a student’s mental health situation plays a significant role in the Ad Board’s evaluation of whether to forcibly send a student home for academic reasons.
According to the Student Handbook, the Dean of the College may place a student on involuntary leave if he or she “has been granted make-up examinations, or extensions of time beyond the end of the term, in two or more courses.” According to Ellison, students in this situation face an Ad Board vote on whether or not they should be allowed to continue.
In cases in which these students are struggling because of their mental or physical health, the Ad Board, with consultation from UHS, will determine whether they think students can sufficiently take make-up examinations while also taking a full-course load the next semester. If the Ad Board decides that a student cannot manage this, the Board may say that the student should not be allowed to continue, though Ellison noted that this decision is “not a punishment.”
Typically, most students who miss two or more exams are permitted to return, including 26 of the 28 cases in the 2012–2013 academic year. But Kate, a College freshman who requested anonymity, had a different experience.
During exam period in the fall of 2012, Kate went to UHS to seek help because she was cutting herself. She was soon voluntarily admitted into McLean Hospital, where she stayed for five days. Her stay at McLean forced her to miss two exams, which her resident dean said she could make up when she returned in the spring. So Kate went home, scheduled meetings with a psychologist, and booked flights back to Cambridge, happy to be back home, but also eager to finish her freshman year.
In January 2013, just days before she was to return to school, she received an email from her resident dean informing her that the Ad Board had already reviewed her case. They had decided she was not fit to come back to Cambridge for the spring. Kate appealed the decision twice and was denied both times.
When asked about Kate’s case, Ellison defended the policy, saying it was designed with students’ best interests in mind.
“We don’t just say, you can’t come back because you’ve got two make-up exams,” Ellison said, adding that he was not commenting on this case specifically. “We say, based on the information that we’ve got from medical professionals who know about the situation, what the concerns are, we don’t think you’re ready to come back.”
And although Kate was placed on leave against her wishes, she sounded a note of optimism about going home.
“I do think that taking time off has been a growing experience, has been a teaching experience,” Kate said. “I’m going to return to Harvard with a newfound appreciation."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard track and field team had a number of record-breaking performances in 2013, but none were as impressive as freshman Martina Salander’s showing at the Indoor NCAA Championships.
 
Salander set a new Ivy League record in the pentathlon with a monstrous 4209 point total, which earned her fifth place at the meet and All-American honors. She first broke the conference record earlier in the season at the Texas A&M Mondo Challenge by recording 4094 points.
 
The rookie’s performance at nationals was a balanced effort, as she turned in impressive marks in each of the five components of the pentathlon.
 
In the 60-meter hurdles, Salander ran a blistering time of 8.61 seconds, which is the fourth-fastest time in school history. She went on to achieve the sixth-best shot put throw and the fifth-farthest long jump in Crimson history en route to her top-five finish.
 
Going into the third component of the event, the shot put, Salander found herself in 12th place despite a relatively strong performance in the hurdles and a decent showing in the high jump. With a personal-best heave that was the top mark in the competition, the rookie catapulted herself into third place with only the long jump and 800-meter run remaining.
 
“Especially with how the high jump went, it was really important for me to score a lot of points [in the shot put],” Salander said.
 
Though she had not yet eclipsed 14 meters in the event, the rookie recorded a mark of 14.23 meters, while no other competitor threw farther than 12.55 meters.
 
She went on to foul on the first two of her three attempts in the long jump before soaring 5.85 meters on her final try.
 
“The biggest moment was when she decided, ‘I’m going to go after it, or I’m going to fold it,’ and that was during the long jump.” Tolbert said. “She was aggressive and had a pretty good jump, and that was what kept her in the mix.”
 
Salander covered the 800-meter run, the final leg of the pentathlon, in 2:19.36 to lock up fifth place in the competition.
 
“She came in a fairly accomplished athlete already, and with the improvement that she’s made in only her freshman year, I think we’ve only been scratching the surface.” Crimson coach Jason Saretsky said. “There’s definitely a tremendous upside to the future of her career at Harvard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Heading into his senior season, men’s tennis co-captain Andy Nguyen was determined to lead his team as best he could. But in order to do so, he first had to stay on the court, something he was unable to do during his junior year.
“I’ve had so many injuries over my four years here,” Nguyen said. “What kept me out my junior year was an abdominal injury that made it tough to serve. I’ve joked that I was always injured, and that I played better injured because it kept my mind focused. I took my body for granted.”
This season, Nguyen overcame a hip injury in the fall and returned stronger than ever in the spring, going 16-4 in dual play singles action as he led the Crimson to a second consecutive Ivy League title and a Round of 32 appearance in the NCAA tournament.
Nguyen also teamed up with freshman Nicky Hu in second doubles, where they posted a 13-5 record in dual play. For his efforts, Nguyen earned second team all-Ivy honors in both singles and doubles.
“I don't really pay attention to individual accolades,” he said. “I did what had to be done in order to get the team a title. The goal was to win Ivies, and I’m just happy that we accomplished that.”
Nguyen was an important force for Harvard both on and off the court, according to head coach Dave Fish.
“It’s dramatic what Andy was able to do,” he said. “Being captain is a special responsibility, and he wanted to do his very best by the team. We didn’t know what to expect from him this year after all of his injuries. But he really drove the spike home this season. He was dominant and knocked the other team’s head off, and the rest of the team followed and killed the body.”
Sophomore Shaun Chaudhuri noted how important of a leader Nguyen was for the team this season.
“He’s taught us so much in terms of leadership and how to push yourself,” he said. “He’s been such a strong force for us all year. Off the court, he’s someone you look up to and want to emulate.”
Nguyen saved his best tennis for the big moments, going 5-2 in conference singles play and posting a 6-1, 6-2 win in the first round of the NCAA tournament against Samford.
The senior led the team this year, but someone else will need to set the tone for the Crimson next year if the team hopes to replicate this year’s success.
“Andy was the guy this year,” Fish said. “So we’ll miss him, and have to hope that someone else steps up and is the guy next year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sophomore defensive end Zach Hodges saw the field in nine games in his first season with the Harvard football team a fall ago, putting together a successful freshman campaign with 20 tackles and three sacks.
 
But his production sophomore year exceeded all expectations. Hodges amassed 32 tackles and a team-high nine sacks to earn second team All-America and first team All-Ivy honors.
 
“I would say that freshman year was kind of a whirlwind,” Hodges said. “I knew what was coming around this time this season. Really, there was just a lot of support; a lot of players played well, and it also kind of made my job easier.”
 
One of Hodges’ top performances came in the first game of the year against San Diego, when he notched two sacks, three tackles for loss, and two quarterback hurries.
 
“He’s got the innate quickness that—we see it quite often and we kind of get used to it, but I know when some of the opponents see it—when he puts his foot in the ground, kids can’t adjust,” Harvard head coach Tim Murphy said.
 
Despite his individual accolades and breakout season, Hodges points to the comeback win against Yale as his best memory from the fall and remains focused on the larger team goals at hand.
 
“Honestly I don’t really care [about the awards],” Hodges said. “It’s very humbling to receive those things, and I’m really grateful…. But more importantly, I try to do whatever to give my team the greatest opportunity to be successful, and just try to focus on that and playing to meet whatever the needs are of my team.”
 
Hodges noted that one point of emphasis this offseason is adding bulk, something he has been working on since the beginning of high school. Murphy also emphasized that the rising junior, despite being a dominant defensive presence now, is by no means a finished product.
 
“He needs to become more consistent; he needs to become more of an every-down player; he needs to be better against the run when they run the ball right at him,” Murphy said. “But the kid’s special, and if he reaches his full potential, he’s going to be one of the best defensive players ever to play at Harvard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the National Hockey League languished in the final days of a lockout, a cross-town college rivalry took the hockey world’s center stage. NBC Sports had found a replacement for its regular Wednesday night January programming as the Harvard men’s hockey team paid a midseason visit to No. 8 Boston University for an out-of-conference match-up.
 
Hockey-hungry fans who tuned in were treated to an instant classic. The Crimson erased a three-goal third-period deficit to pull off an upset overtime win on national television.
 
“I thought our guys showed tremendous character,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “Coming back in a really wild and crazy game, I think beating a very good team like BU in their own building was really quite a tribute to our collective willingness to never give up.”
 
Early in the third, it appeared that the nationally-ranked home team would cruise to an easy win against a squad mired in a six-game winless streak. The Terriers led the Crimson, 5-2, with less than 15 minutes left in regulation.
 
But senior Marshall Everson buried a rebound from classmate Alex Fallstrom in the seventh minute of the third. Less than two minutes later, senior Luke Greiner outmaneuvered BU defender Ahti Oksanen before beating goaltender Matt O’Connor glove-side to draw within one on the power play. Suddenly, Harvard was back in business.
 
“Going into that third period, I feel that the mindset in the locker room was different,” senior forward Alex Fallstrom said. “All of the guys were all on the same page, and us having that mindset we just decided to go out and win it.”
 
Under four minutes to play in the frame, Colin Blackwell produced the tying goal off one of the prettiest plays of the season. Skating across the Terrier blueline, the senior lobbed the puck toward the goal and crashed the crease. The biscuit bounced off the pads of O’Connor before he could corral it, and Blackwell won the footrace to the net to bury the Crimson’s fifth goal of the game.
 
Blackwell’s highlight-worthy goal did not make SportsCenter’s Top Ten Plays. Connor Morrison’s did.
 
Morrison completed Harvard’s comeback with less than 50 seconds left in overtime. A stretch pass from sophomore Tommy O’Regan set up the senior on a breakaway that culminated in a winning shot from just inside the left faceoff circle. The play made No. 8 on ESPN the next morning.
 
“I was really happy for Connor that he got that goal; that’s a really cool experience,” Fallstrom said. “I think that’s something that he will always remember and cherish about his Harvard career.”
 
With the win, Harvard broke a five-year drought in the extra frame. Its last overtime victory—a 2-1 win on Nov. 20, 2007—had also come at BU.
 
The contest also lived up to its hype as a sibling rivalry game. Tommy O’Regan (1 goal, 2 assists) and BU freshman Danny O’Regan (2 goals, 1 assist) combined for six points on the night in the brothers’ first intercollegiate competition against one another. 
 
It would take Harvard another five games to score its next six goals. The comeback, sandwiched in between six- and nine-game winless streaks, came during the Crimson’s toughest stretch of the season. But Harvard had the Terriers’ number this year. The Crimson beat BU in the Beanpot consolation game a month later, 7-4.

A day before Siyani Chambers guided the Harvard men’s basketball team to a 68-62 upset over the University of New Mexico in the second round of the NCAA Tournament, another rookie playmaker turned in a breakout performance for the Crimson. Devin Dwyer recorded his first NCAA hat trick as the Harvard men’s lacrosse team defeated Bryant, 7-5, on March 20.
It was an unusual goal-scoring spree from a freshman who was establishing himself as the Crimson’s go-to assist-man. Indeed, Dwyer made his mark more through his set-ups than through his strikes this year. By the end of the season, the top-five recruit was the Chambers of the lacrosse team—the point guard, the distributor, the quarterback of the Harvard offense.
Dwyer arrived at Harvard last fall on the heels of high expectations. Inside Lacrosse Magazine named the Garden City, N.Y. native the No. 4 recruit of the Class of 2016 after he led his high school squad to an undefeated season and a virtual national championship. Yet few expected that Dwyer would post team-leading marks in assists (27) and points (43) in his first year. 
“Right when he stepped on campus and started playing with us, we recognized he was a special player,” captain Jason Gonos said. “It was easy to tell that he was going to be a very good player for us. But that being said, you never really know, you can’t exactly expect a freshman to be playing that well and to be able to handle the speed of Division I games coming right out of high school.”
Dwyer’s 16 goals were also third among Crimson scorers. The freshman scored at least one point in all but one game this season.
“I don’t think we quite realized how good he would become over the course of the year,” Gonos said.
Dwyer made his home this season at the X. His vision behind the net elevated the play of those around him, said Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ‘96.
“Devin did a great job as the distributor on our offense from behind the goal—such an important position, QB’ing the offense and being able to distribute the ball effectively to teammates,” Wojcik said. “He helps with his distribution skills to make the players around him better.”
In addition to his hat trick versus Bryant, Dwyer’s top scoring efforts this year included six-point games in wins over Holy Cross and Quinnipiac as well as a five-point effort in the Crimson’s loss to Cornell. At the end of the season, the New England Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association named Dwyer All-New England Rookie of the Year. Dwyer also received Honorable Mention All-Ivy honors.

In a year of rebuilding for Harvard softball, several players have stepped up to show that despite the talent that the team lost this season, the future is looking bright for the Crimson.
 
Emily Gusse is one of those players whose marked improvement has earned the attention of those on and off the team. Much of the improvement has come in the infield, where this year Gusse has moved from second base to shortstop, a position she played throughout high school.
 
“I approached it a little differently,” Gusse said. “I played second base my freshman year and that was a bit of a challenge for me because I’d never played there before. I got the opportunity to play shortstop this year and I kind of just went in all-or-nothing and had a really good year.”
 
A strong work ethic and positive mentality helped contribute to her success.
 
 “Her mindset was the key to her success,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said. “She worked a lot on her mental game, especially recovering after she made a mistake. She set strong goals for herself that she wanted to start at shortstop with the graduation of Jane Alexander. She still has areas where she can grow and where we are expecting her to grow [but] she’s emerged as a great contact hitter.”
 
On top of the improvement in fielding, Gusse has seen her hitting numbers more than double in her sophomore season. She finished the season with 11 runs, 24 RBIs, and a .290 batting average, a huge improvement over the four runs and six RBIs she posted last year.
 
Several of her runs came at vital points in the season, in a number of conference games that helped keep the Crimson’s in contention for the North Division until the end of the season. Gusse had one run and four RBIs in Harvard’s matchups against Yale to help win all four games. A run and an RBI in a pivotal game three against Dartmouth helped the Crimson come tantalizingly close to keeping its playoff hopes alive, although Harvard ended up losing the contest, 5-4.
 
Gusse is keeping optimistic about the future of the team, and as a sophomore knows there is much more time for improvement.
 
“If you make a mistake you’re going to pick yourself up and keep going,” Gusse said. “I feel like I worked really, really hard and gave it all that I had and got the result that I wanted.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Temi Fagbenle is a rookie, but not in the way that most Harvard athletes fit the label. The sophomore was recruited out of England as the team’s highest-rated recruit, but wound up warming the bench during her freshman year after the NCAA declared her ineligible for the 2011-12 season due to an academic rule concerning her transition into the American educational system.
 
“Obviously, I wasn’t happy about it, and I didn’t really understand why,” Fagbenle said. “I felt as if I was dealt an injustice, but that’s all in the past now.”
 
After multiple attempts to appeal the decision, it seemed that the London native would not get to play ball until her sophomore fall. But that spring, Fagbenle’s luck turned—she was selected to play for Great Britain in the Olympics hosted in her hometown.
 
Although Great Britain did not pick up a victory in the Games, Fagbenle’s role on the team carried over into her first year as an active Harvard player and her first year as a collegiate player.
 
“It’s a whole different level of play,” Fagbenle said. “The transition was more difficult than I thought it would be, and I’m still a little bit nervous trying to adjust to this game, but it’s been fun.”
 
Fagbenle shot 57.8 percent from the field to lead all Crimson starters and averaged 12.3 points per game, garnering her 10 Ivy League Rookie of the Week awards and a unanimous vote for Ivy League Rookie of the Year. Despite Fagbenle’s seven double-doubles this season, Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith maintains that the rising junior has not reached her full potential yet.
 
“I was always warned that transitioning from the Olympics, particularly for a kid who had never played college ball, would be difficult. Temi did it as well as you could expect any athlete to do it,” Delaney-Smith said. “What the doctor would have ordered would have been a lot of rest and a lot of rehab coming off of the Olympics, and she really didn’t have the luxury to do that, and she still impacted our season each and every day.”
 
Leading the team in both rebounds per game with 7.7 and blocks per game, Fagbenle demonstrated her prowess on both ends of the court. But with Fagbenle just a sophomore, Delaney-Smith notes that the forward will only grow as a weapon on the team.
 
“The thing that’s scary for anyone playing us going forward will be her versatility,” Delaney-Smith said. “She’s got great shooting, she’s not one-dimensional, and I think our system’s going to broaden next year, where I think they’re going to bring in a double-team in order to stop her. But I think she can continue to grow as a rebounder and as a perimeter player.”

For two sets, junior Gary Power didn’t have enough. 
 
With the Harvard men’s squash team tied with the Princeton Tigers, 4-4, in the national semifinals, Power was the team’s final hope. Four players who had lost to the Tigers in the previous matchup, a 5-4 defeat on Jan. 13, had scored victories on the day. Then junior Ali Farag—who had never lost in his collegiate career—fell in three sets. The four Crimson players who had scored victories against their Tigers opponents a month earlier in Cambridge had fallen one by one. A spot in the national championship, which had eluded Harvard in 2012, was on the line; a rematch with Trinity awaited the winner. 
 
“Farag had taken a big loss and our captain was out with an injury, and at the time we were not looking good at all,” Crimson coach Mike Way said. 
 
Harvard’s No. 1 player before Farag joined the team, Power had since dropped in the team rankings. Playing the fourth line for the team, he had posted a dominating 11-3 record on the season. But against Princeton’s Dylan Ward, Power was in trouble. After dropping the first set, 6-11, he could not close a tight second set, 10-12, and entered the third with his back against the wall. All eight other matches had been settled in four sets or fewer; no player had dropped the first two sets and even managed to claim the third.
 
At this point, Way said he turned to an assistant coach and murmured that Power just needed the third set. For the player whom Way calls “the fittest guy in college squash,” the opening didn’t need to be large. Given an inch, Power would take a mile. 
 
And, against the odds, Power fought back and took the third set, 11-7. He pushed the match to a fifth set by the same score in the fourth, sending Ward reeling. In the fifth, Power scored a third consecutive 11-7 victory to push the Crimson into the finals. 
 
“There’s nobody more determined,” Way said. “If you put determination in a beast like that, you’re going to get something quite awesome.” 
 
Although the team fell in the finals, 6-3, to Trinity, Way said that Power’s play will not be forgotten. 
 
“I’ve only been here three seasons but that was the biggest moment I’ve ever seen,” Way said afterward. “For him to come out and do what he did was absolutely heroic.”

Going into the season without injured would-be starting defenders senior Josephine Pucci and junior Marissa Gedman, the Harvard women’s hockey team faced major question marks.
But the Crimson got as good a start as it could have hoped for and never looked back.
“Doing what we weren’t expected to do was probably the best part of the whole experience,” junior forward Lyndsey Fry said.
In the span of nine days, Harvard swept four conference opponents on the road by a combined score of 18-1. The Crimson would ride the hot streak to an 18-1-1 start.
“You just got to keep grinding and hope it works out,” co-captain forward Jillian Dempsey said of the long season.
When the Crimson returned to Bright Hockey Center, it took down eventual ECAC champion Cornell.
“The most rewarding thing was, as an upperclassman, finally beating teams like Boston University and Cornell,” Fry said. “In my time here we’ve never won big games like that against top teams.”
While Harvard fell short of accomplishing its ultimate goal of winning the national championship, the Crimson’s season was interspersed with plenty of high notes, including its first Ivy League title since 2009, a playoff run in the ECAC, and a No. 2 spot in the national rankings at one point during the year.
“The fact that we pulled together with what we had was unbelievable,” Fry said. “The people that needed to step up stepped up.”
In the ECAC postseason’s final weekend, Harvard avenged its lone home loss against Clarkson in the semifinals before falling to a Cornell side that benefitted from playing on its home ice.
“To finally get that win [against Clarkson] at the opportune moment was pretty clutch and amazing,” Dempsey said.
The semifinal victory, a response to a disappointing Senior Day, was impressive enough to earn the Crimson a spot in the NCAA tournament.
The underdogs bowed out in the quarterfinals, falling 3-1 to Boston College.
“All of us in our hearts believed we could have won that game,” said Fry of the game that brought the Crimson’s season to a premature halt. “We just didn’t show up that day.”
The squad owes a large part of its success this season to the goaltending duo of freshman standout, Emerance Maschmeyer, and outgoing co-captain Laura Bellamy.
“We competed every day and just made each other better,” said Bellamy, who owned the nation’s top goals-against average by the season’s end.
“We were extremely fortunate to have two very capable goalies,” Dempsey added.
Harvard rode a 10-1-1 record to No. 4 in the USA Today/USA Hockey Magazine poll by midseason.
In its next game, the Crimson defended its perfect 8-0-0 ECAC record against a Union side still searching for its first conference victory.
Harvard humiliated the Dutchwomen, netting nine goals in front of a Union-friendly crowd in Schenectady, N.Y.
Dempsey found the back of the net twice and assisted on three other goals over the course of the onslaught. The senior led the Crimson in scoring on the season with 45 points.
Dempsey had support from junior linemates Kalley Armstrong and Fry. The two combined for 27 goals and 31 assists.
“We both see the ice really well,” Fry said. “Our styles mesh well together.”
Freshman forward Mary Parker also played a big role in a Crimson offense that scored 3.32 goals per game, a mark good for eighth in the country.
The Union game catalyzed a Harvard side that took the next seven games in regulation.
“Of course that gets the team psyched,” said Bellamy of the scoring in the road matchup. “We were feeling good about ourselves so that probably brought up the morale.”
Due to inclement weather in February, the Crimson was forced to close out its regular season later than initially scheduled.
An eventual victory over Yale in the postponed game gave Harvard, which managed just one point in its previous two scheduled conference matchups, a bit of momentum going into the postseason.
The Crimson went on to dominate Dartmouth in a best of three series, following a 4-0 shutout in the first game with a 3-0 victory the next afternoon.
Maschmeyer, who started both games in net, put on a clinic on home ice throughout the season, allowing just eight goals in eight games at Bright.
For the second straight season, Harvard dropped its first-round Beanpot matchup. This year, it fell to BC, which squeaked out the 2-1 victory after conceding a late goal to the potent Crimson offense. Harvard bounced back to beat BU 3-0 in the consolation game.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Jimmy Vesey entered college with a fairly substantial list of accomplishments on the ice. A top-100 recruit, the North Reading, Mass., native was selected in the third round of the NHL draft by the Nashville Predators before stepping foot on campus. After a year in which Vesey won a U-20 World Championship with Team USA and earned Ivy League Rookie of the Year honors for Harvard, it’s fair to say that the freshman has lived up to the lofty expectations.
 
“Jimmy was great,” senior forward Alex Fallstrom said. “He was really one of the players that stepped up for us during the year. I think he’s got a great career ahead of him, not only at Harvard but beyond that, too.” 
 
Along with classmates Brian Hart and Kyle Criscuolo, Vesey brought some firepower to a fairly anemic offensive attack that struggled to replace the production of first team All-American, and current Tampa Bay Lightning forward, Alex Killorn ’12. Despite missing five games, Vesey tied senior Marshall Everson for the team lead with 11 goals.
 
“As a freshman, his play and maturity level were way above that of a regular freshman,” Fallstrom said. 
 
Vesey started the season on a hot streak, scoring six goals in the first six games, including a pair of braces in victories against Bentley and Rensselaer, and was a major reason for the Crimson’s 4-2 start and season-high No. 17 national ranking. His early season play earned him ECAC Rookie of the Month honors for November, in a conference that featured eventual Frozen Four finalists Yale and Quinnipiac.
 
During the winter break, Vesey joined the U.S. National Junior Team at the 2013 International Ice Hockey Federation World Junior Championship in Ufa, Russia. Vesey tallied three assists in a 9-3 group stage victory over Slovakia, and then scored in the Americans’ 4-0 semifinal upset of tournament-favorite Canada. Team USA went on to win gold over Sweden.
 
But the rookie went cold as the college season wore on, and so too did Harvard, which went 6-15-2 after the winter break.
 
“Certainly during the first part of our season he was our go-to producer. I think after he went to the World Juniors and won a gold medal there, he came back a little bit on the tired side,” Donato said. “It’s understandable. He was juggling some injuries toward the end of the  season, but all in all, he was able to establish himself as a difference-maker.”
 
Upon Vesey’s return to Harvard, the Crimson won an overtime upset victory over No. 8 Boston University. But Harvard followed the victory over the Terriers with eight straight losses, and Vesey scored just one goal in 11 February and March games to close out the year.
 
Still, the rookie enjoyed a series of successes uncommon for a freshman but consistent with his prodigious talent.
“Jimmy’s got some great offensive gifts, and he’s a natural goal scorer,” Donato said. “I think that’s something we hoped and expected, and he’s only going to get better now that he’s had some experience at this level.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In EIVA volleyball, the conference championship has become somewhat of a forgone conclusion. Penn State has taken 15 straight EIVA titles and is one of the few teams west of the Rocky Mountains to consistently challenge for a national championship. While the rest of the EIVA certainly is not a David, the Nittany Lions are a Goliath.
So when Penn State arrived in Cambridge with a 51-game conference-win streak stretching back to its 2008 national championship season, few observers expected the Crimson, an emerging force in the EIVA, to challenge the Nittany Lions’ hegemony. But behind strong service and passing, Harvard was able to strike early and often for one of the biggest upsets in EIVA history, 3-0.
Sophomore outside hitter DJ White returned from injury to register a game-high 13 kills as the home team put Penn State on its heels early.
Junior co-captain Nick Madden attributes much of the victory to both White’s and the home crowd’s presence. Throughout the season, the MAC proved challenging for visitors, with the Crimson falling only once in Cambridge. 
“They’re used to their 2000 fans at their school, but when they would get a kill, it was silent,” Madden said. “When we would do something, even if it wasn’t a great play, we would have all of our buddies and parents there cheering. Fan support was huge in that game.”
When the configuration of the EIVA changed in 2011, setting up two regular season meetings between the Crimson and the Nittany Lions, co-captain Rob Lothman was not positive he would ever see Harvard challenge the squad.
“I think we laughed a bit realizing that Penn State was going to have to come to the MAC and climb all of our stairs to the smaller gym with a smaller crowd,” the senior said.
But as the 2012 season saw the Crimson jump from a 9-13 team to an 18-6 team, including a tough five-set loss to Penn State in which Harvard led 2-0, belief began to infect the team. And after another five-set loss on Jan. 26, the Crimson knew it was on the brink.
For Lothman, the game will always be one of the defining moments of his Harvard career.
“I’m going to remember that game forever,” the co-captain said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To succeed in the Harvard women’s ice hockey locker room, one must be willing to put the team in front of all else. “Team First,” we call it. Understanding the immense commitment we make to the University, as well as the other players and coaches, is what allows us to come together as a team year after year. My friend and teammate Jillian Dempsey epitomized what it meant to play for the “H” on the front of our jerseys over the last four years.
A truly special hockey player, “Demps,” as she’s commonly known, made it look easy to go the extra mile every single day. A small percentage of players possess her combination of speed and skill, but even fewer can say they are as passionate about the game as Jillian Dempsey.
Her love of hockey produced a child-like joy on the ice, and its effect on the team proved to be invaluable this winter. Without her hard work and dedication setting an example, we may not have earned a berth in the NCAA tournament.
Without knowing it, Jillian summarized her illustrious career via Twitter (@JilliantDempsey) just hours before the last game of our college careers together. Referring to our NCAA quarterfinal matchup against a favored Boston College squad, Demps tweeted, “But what the odds don’t know is this isn’t a math test. This is a completely different kind of test.”  As the famous phrase goes on to say, but for which Twitter’s 140 characters did not allow her to add, this is a test “where passion has a funny way of trumping logic.”
To me and the rest of her teammates, that last stanza defined our number 14 for the past four seasons. Passion does have a funny way of trumping logic.  We all witnessed passion running circles (and stadiums) around logic on a daily basis.
Logically speaking, the slender kid from Winthrop, Mass., shouldn’t have been able to put up 148 points (76 goals, 72 assists) in 129 career outings. If hockey was about logic, she shouldn’t have been a point-per-game player for the latter half of her career. It’s not logical that she finished among the top ten all-time scorers at Harvard—a group filled with several program legends and past Olympians.
What exactly is so illogical about Dempsey’s career numbers? At 5’4”, she constantly found herself battling against bigger individuals. Common sense says someone with her frame would constantly be dogged by questions about physical strength.
Dempsey emphatically answered any of those questions by showing up night-in and night-out and producing as one of the most effective all-around forwards in the country. That consistency and drive all stems from her passion for the game and for Harvard Hockey. She’s the only person shooting pucks at Bright Hockey Center on the morning of Christmas Eve.
She’s passionate about hard work and pushing her physical limits in the weight room and on the ice. And that is why, as teammates who have had the privilege to see her sheer determination to prove logic wrong on a daily basis, none of us were surprised to see her garner All-ECAC and All-Ivy recognitions for four straight years, earn back-to-back nods as a finalist for ECAC Player of the Year, and be recognized her senior year as one of 10 finalists for the Patty Kazmaier Award given annually to the top player in Division I women’s ice hockey. None of us were surprised, because we’ve seen firsthand how passion trumps logic.
The laundry list of accolades Jillian racked up at Harvard are well deserved. She defines consistency and was our “go-to” player in tight situations. She’s a huge reason the last four years have included a Beanpot championship, an Ivy League title and a pair of appearances in the NCAA Tournament.
While her stats are a big part of her legacy at Harvard, it’s just the tip of the iceberg as far as her long-term impact goes. That impact won’t come from gaudy point totals, but rather the example she set for nearly half a decade. Most star players avoid blocking shots, playing responsible defense, and hustling back to the bench between shifts.
Demps did all of that because she never lost sight of her commitment to Harvard University and to its hockey program. She had an insatiable appetite to perform better no matter how well she played, and, as her teammates, we couldn’t help but to be inspired and to follow her lead. I speak for all of us when I say it was an honor to be her teammate. Jillian Dempsey’s days in a Harvard sweater may be over, but her presence in the program will be felt for years to come.
Bellamy co-captained the team with Dempsey this season. As a senior goalkeeper, Bellamy was first in the nation in goals against average.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It only took a second for the ball to fly over the net and hit the floor, but it was a moment years in the making. When sophomore middle hitter Caleb Zimmick’s serve went untouched, history was made. The Harvard men’s volleyball team had fought back from the brink of elimination to earn the program’s first playoff win in a thrilling five-set overtime match against EIVA rival George Mason.
And while most eyes were following the Crimson’s March Madness success, Harvard’s other team that plays with nets on the hardwood quietly put together the best season in the team’s history, taking another step for the program after reaching the playoffs for the first time last season.
“It was really good to show this season that we belong in the upper echelon of this league,” co-captain Rob Lothman said. “We were not a one-year wonder last year. We are a team that has got staying power and we are going to continually be there.”
The Crimson tied a program-best for wins on the season with 18. Zimmick, a second-team All-EIVA player, led the conference with a .374 kill percentage. Fellow sophomore outside hitter DJ White sat just behind Zimmick with a .314 kill percentage and earned the team’s sole spot on the all-conference first team.
Co-captains Lothman and junior outside hitter Nick Madden also served as motors of the offense, with Madden leading Harvard with 249 kills on the year. Lothman ranked third in the league in assists and earned All-EIVA academic honors while joining Zimmick and junior middle blocker Kyle Rehkemper on the All-EIVA second team.
The playoff win over the Patriots was not the program’s only “first” of the season. After two seasons of forcing five-set matches, including a Jan. 26 loss, the Crimson finally took down perennial EIVA champion Penn State with a convincing 3-0 victory at the Malkin Athletic Center. White, who missed the first meeting with the Nittany Lions due to injury, returned to notch a game-high 13 kills.
The win ended Penn State’s 51-game conference win streak that had lasted nearly five years while propelling Harvard to three more sweeps of conference opponents throughout the next two weekends of play.
But the momentum did not last, as the Crimson dropped two road matches to George Mason and Princeton before a month-long break from conference play. During that time, the team took its spring break trip to California to take on some of the country’s top teams. For the 2012 squad, successes over established programs like No. 8 Cal Baptist and No. 14 Cal-State Northridge propelled Harvard into the national spotlight and the team’s first NCAA ranking.
But the 2013 spring break trip proved less fruitful, as the Crimson was swept by UC Santa Barbara, Cal Baptist, and Concordia.
“It was a wake-up call,” Madden said. “A lot of guys, including me, were pretty proud of ourselves, and you cannot let pride take ahold of you in the middle of the season. Getting slapped around a little bit in California was very good for us in getting motivated. Coming back, we were crisp, sharp, and ready to take it into the playoffs.”
The squad went 5-1 the rest of the way to take the third seed in the playoffs, setting up a faceoff with the Patriots, the only team to beat Harvard twice during the season.
George Mason seemed ready to move on in the playoffs, taking a commanding 25-17 victory in the third set. But Harvard persevered, tying the score and getting clutch hits from Zimmick and others in overtime to take the fifth set, 19-17.
After the Nittany Lions took down Princeton in the other semi, the Crimson took the confidence gained from their earlier victory against Penn State into the team’s first EIVA championship game. But Harvard could not pull off the upset twice, falling in straight sets as Penn State won its 15th straight EIVA championship.
Lothman believes just being in the game was a big moment for the program.
“I never thought four years ago, even three years ago, our program would be in place to compete for an NCAA tournament berth,” the senior setter said. “So to get there this year and take that small step after our big step last year is huge.”
Looking forward, Lothman is hopeful for the future.
“We’re waiting for another big step, to get that Final Four berth,” he said. “I think it’s going to happen within the next couple of years. This year, we showed that we are there, we’re going to compete for it, and we belong there.”

Christian Webster is the winningest player in Harvard men’s basketball history. This fact alone speaks to the influence he has had on the Crimson’s success. In his four years at Harvard, he helped take the program from an upstart to a contender to, eventually, three Ivy League championships. But more than that, his presence on the court, in the locker room, and on campus has been invaluable to the Harvard University community at large. Christian was the consummate player, leader, and teammate, and he has left a legacy at this university that will be extremely difficult to surpass.
As a freshman, Christian stepped in and contributed right away on the court; he helped lead the team to its first-ever 20-win season while playing the second-most minutes on the team. As a sophomore, he took on an even greater role as a scorer and defender, and this continued throughout his junior and senior seasons. One of Christian’s greatest attributes as a player was his versatility. In one game during his sophomore season, he racked up almost 30 points; if the team needed him to score, Christian scored. During a win against Columbia later in the year, Christian barely scored at all, yet coach Tommy Amaker lauded his performance defending the Lions’ best player as one of the keys to the win. Christian’s ability and willingness to provide what the team needed when the team needed it made him a critical part of the Crimson’s success throughout his career.
In addition to attaining success as a player, Christian took on the challenging role of a team leader as his career progressed. As a senior, he was asked to spearhead the team with his voice and his play as a co-captain. He would be the first to say that it wasn’t always easy. For his first few years with the team, Christian let his play do the talking for him as other, older players fulfilled the role of vocal leaders. But he grew into the role admirably as the season progressed. He praised his teammates’ accomplishments liberally and his criticism was always aimed at improving the team. He was willing to say what needed to be said to the team or to a player at the appropriate time whether it was praise or criticism. But most importantly, his voice carried weight with his teammates and coaches because of his unwavering dedication to making himself and his team better every day.
Christian was able to be such a great leader because he was an excellent teammate. He was willing to sacrifice points, playing time and headlines to help Harvard win. This was especially evident in his sophomore and junior seasons. Although his individual statistics declined between the two campaigns, he remained a vital component of the team’s success, as the Crimson’s win total increased and it advanced to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 1946. In his senior season, Christian’s ability to involve and empower the team’s underclassmen was a crucial reason why Harvard was able to do so well with such a young team. He allowed his talented but less-experienced teammates chances to assert themselves on and off the court, and because of this, the Crimson was able to maximize the talent it had, and become greater than the sum of its parts.
While Christian’s sacrifices were certainly important to Harvard’s success, it would be a grave omission not to highlight his propensity for clutch plays, especially in his senior season. He made three pivotal shots in a row with less than two minutes to play to keep Harvard alive against Dartmouth in an important conference comeback win at home. The following weekend, he made several more important baskets in two overtime periods against Brown in yet another home win. He was quietly confident in his ability as a shooter, and when Harvard urgently needed a basket as games wound down, Christian delivered over and over again.
It would be almost impossible to know all these things about Christian when speaking with him, though. He rarely, if ever, speaks about his personal accomplishments, always choosing to point out the work his teammates and coaches have done before he mentions his own. His genuine humility, positive attitude, and quiet charisma are a credit to himself and his family, and these traits have been invaluable to the Harvard men’s basketball program. Christian has been one of the most important people in the program’s rise to prominence and his presence will be missed greatly by his teammates, coaches and the Harvard community.
Hamel is a junior on the men’s basketball team and has played with Christian Webster for the past three years, all of which ended in Harvard winning an Ivy League championship.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After starting each of the Crimson’s five postseason games, freshman goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer led the Harvard women’s hockey team to the precipice of both ECAC and national titles.
 
“She just doesn’t have a nerve in her body,” said co-captain and fellow goaltender Laura Bellamy. “She lives for that kind of stuff.” 
 
Coming into the season, Maschmeyer had an impressive pedigree. In high school, the goalkeeper spearheaded a campaign that resulted in an IIHF gold medal for the U18 Canadian team. Yet Maschmeyer did not earn the Harvard women’s hockey starting goaltending position before the season started. 
 
“They weren’t guaranteed the net,” said co-captain Jillian Dempsey of Maschmeyer and Bellamy.  “[It fostered] a great sense of competition.” 
 
From the beginning, Maschmeyer found herself in a competition with Bellamy, who was established as the squad’s starter in the middle of her freshman year. 
 
“The competition only made them better,” junior forward Lyndsey Fry said. “It just pushed them both to become better goalies.”
 
Bellamy was a finalist for last year’s ECAC Student Athlete of the Year award. 
 
“She is such a hard worker,” Maschmeyer said of Bellamy. “I know I can rely on her for anything both on and off the ice.” 
 
Maschmeyer seemed to have no trouble adjusting to her collegiate role. The newcomer, who split time with Bellamy early in the season, capitalized on early opportunities, stopping 72 of the first 75 shots she faced. The performance was good enough to earn the Crimson regulation victories in each of her first four games. 
 
But the freshman standout only got better with time. 
 
“Individually, I felt that I improved a lot,” Maschmeyer said. 
 
Maschmeyer had some of her best performances in the biggest moments. In the ECAC quarterfinals against Dartmouth, the freshman posted back-to-back shutouts. 
 
“She did not play like a freshman,” Dempsey said.  “She played like somebody who had been there before.”
 
The freshman complimented her mentor’s great season and the influence Bellamy had on her own play. 
 
“She is a very skilled goalie,” Maschmeyer said. “I think that we learned a lot from each other on the ice.”
 
By the season’s end, Bellamy and Maschmeyer ranked first and second in the conference, respectively, in both goals against average and save percentage.
 
But the numbers do not tell the whole story.
 
“She’s just so naturally talented,” Bellamy said of Maschmeyer.  “She played big-time in big games.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the Harvard men’s hockey team, the 2012-13 season was one of  fleeting highs and sustained lows.
The Crimson beat then-No. 10 Cornell on the road, erased a three-goal deficit at then-No. 8 Boston University, and upset then-No. 1 Quinnipiac. But that same team also experienced a three-month winless streak against conference opponents, finished last in the league standings for the first time in program history, and fell from first to worst on the power play.
Harvard struggled through the winter after injuries and unexpected departures left the team shorthanded. The Crimson won only one game in the months of December and January, as coach Ted Donato ’91 reshuffled lines and called up a defenseman from the Harvard club team.
“It was a unique and strange season due to some unforeseen circumstances,” Donato said. “It was a tough year injury-wise. We were really snake-bit with the number of guys that missed the amount of time that they did.”
Harvard opened its season strong, carrying high expectations following a surprise run to the conference championship game in 2012. The Crimson cruised to a 4-1 win over then-No. 10 Cornell and boasted a winning record through the month of November. Freshman forward Jimmy Vesey netted five goals in his first five games.
Yet, Harvard would win only one of its next 15 contests following leaves of absence from sophomore defensemen Max Everson and Patrick McNally. A 5-0 home loss to UMass-Lowell on Dec. 10 signaled the beginning of the Crimson’s struggles. Harvard would not win a conference game until a 4-1 victory over Colgate on Feb. 15.
In the midst of Harvard’s toughest losing stretch, the Crimson did manage to pull off a shocker at Boston University on Jan. 9. A breakaway goal in overtime from senior forward Conor Morrison capped off a 4-0 Harvard run to secure a 6-5 win.
Unfortunately for the Crimson, the impressive comeback failed to spark a lasting change of fortune. Harvard dropped its next eight games following the win over the Terriers. A year after leading the nation on the man advantage, the Crimson’s power play efficiency rating ranked last among Division I teams after a 4-1 loss to Boston College in the Beanpot semifinal.
Harvard came closer to full strength in the final month of the regular season. In the year’s penultimate home game, the Crimson unseated then-No. 1 Quinnipiac, 2-1, in overtime. Freshman forward Kyle Criscuolo provided the tying goal early in the third period before senior center Alex Fallstrom netted the game-winner with less than 20 seconds left in the extra frame.
“It was just great winning that game and proving that we could be a real contender in the playoffs,” said Fallstrom, who led the team in points this year. “It’s something that I will always remember when I think back to my Harvard career.”
The win was Harvard’s first over a top-ranked opponent since 2004.
In the postseason, the Crimson looked to make some noise after edging Dartmouth, 2-1, in the opening game of the first round of the ECAC Tournament. But the Big Green dominated Harvard by an aggregate score of 10-4 over the next two games to deny the No. 12 seed any shot at postseason redemption.
Harvard can take some consolation in the fact that it had to contend with the nation’s top conference this year. The ECAC had a banner season, with Yale and Quinnipiac meeting in April for the national championship.
“It was apparent throughout the year that our league was very strong, and you can see our non-conference record was a great example of that,” Donato said.
The Crimson will have to continue to fill voids next year as it graduates six seniors from the Class of 2013. But unlike this year, a full Harvard bench should have the personnel to step in.
“We will have a really large influx of players,” Donato said. “Next year, we will have more than a full allotment. Hopefully, we’ll put a great amount of time this summer and fall into doing some things that we hope will allow us to be more healthy than we were last year, and I think, from a numbers standpoint, we will be better situated to handle some injuries.”
Despite falling well short of expectations this year, the Crimson’s brief flashes of brilliance indicate untapped potential.
As Fallstrom prepares to pursue a professional career with the Boston Bruins organization, he believes that the team’s young core can build off the year’s highs and lows.
“We were really disappointed, but I think a lot of good things can still be taken away from this year,” Fallstrom said. “All these guys have one more year of experience, and I think that’s going to benefit them a lot.”

Another year, another Ivy League title for the Harvard men’s tennis team. This season, the Crimson replicated the success of last year’s team by posting a 6-1 conference record en route to the Ancient Eight crown and the Round of 32 in the NCAA Tournament.
That the team was forced to rebuild after losing top seniors Jon Pearlman, the No. 1 singles player, and Alistair Felton, who competed in No. 1 doubles, makes this season’s success all the more impressive.
“We started out with a bunch of unknowns,” head coach Dave Fish ’72 said. “If you had said at the beginning of the year that this team would be ranked as high as 16th in the country, we’d say, ‘wow, that’s great.’ If you told us we’d win in the first round of NCAAs and make the final 32, we’d say, ‘let me sign up for that.’”
With co-captain Andy Nguyen and junior co-captain Casey MacMaster as the only upperclassmen in the starting lineup, Harvard’s freshman and sophomore classes stepped up in a big way to keep the team in contention for the Ivy title.
In the absence of Pearlman, sophomore Denis Nguyen moved up to the No. 1 singles position and proved that he could hang with the top players in the country, going 4-3 in Ivy play.
Sophomore Shaun Chaudhuri, who dominated last season in the lower singles spots, was just as good on the second court this season with an 11-5 record in dual play.
“Denis and Shaun gave us some punch at the top that we didn’t have last year,” Fish said.
Sophomore Alex Steinroeder held down the No. 3 spot, and freshmen Nicky Hu and Kelvin Lam competed in both singles and doubles.
Andy Nguyen, who had been injured for much of his first three seasons for the Crimson, took a leap forward by staying healthy and had a 16-4 dual play record.
“Andy went from being injured much of last spring to getting some great wins this season,” Fish said. “But more broadly, our success this season came because everyone made everyone else better. If you take anyone’s improvement out of there, none of this happens.”
The composition of this year’s Ivy League-winning team may have been different than last, but its level of success was still the same.
The team’s hallmark this season was its dominance in doubles. The Crimson captured the doubles point in 19 of its 25 matches, including a stretch of 12 straight in the middle of the season.
Its top tandem of MacMaster and Denis Nguyen went 12-2 in dual play and was ranked as highly as 52nd in the country. Hu and Andy Nguyen went 13-5 at No. 2, and Steinroeder and Lam went 8-2 in dual play on the third court.
“I don’t think we’ve ever won that many doubles points before,” Fish said. “It gives us a huge leg up because we’re probably not better than most teams such that we can win four [of six] singles matches, but we can win three.”
But it was not always smooth sailing for Harvard. The team struggled with injuries early on, leading to losses to unranked teams like Old Dominion on Feb. 3.
“Our first few losses were a result of not having enough guys in the lineup,” Andy Nguyen said. “We lost to some bad teams because we couldn’t field a team. But gradually, we got healthier and showed what we could do.”
Nguyen cited two road victories over Vanderbilt and Northwestern in Evanston, Ill. in early February as crucial for building the team’s confidence.
After those two wins, the team found its rhythm in doubles and ripped off victories in 13 of its next 14 matches.
The Crimson’s success culminated with a win over Dartmouth to clinch the Ancient Eight crown and an NCAA tournament victory over Samford.
Harvard fell to No. 10 Mississippi State in the second round, ending its hopes of reaching the Round of 16.
“One of our goals was to make the Sweet 16,” Chaudhuri said. “We won the doubles point and pushed a really good team to potentially make it but fell just short.”
Entering this season, such lofty goals were emblematic of optimism that was ultimately justified. With just one departing senior, the goal of making an extended run in the NCAA tournament will become an expectation for the dominant squad in the Ivy League.
“We have all the ingredients to have another really fine team next year,” Fish said. “But we’ll have to play with the same kind of guts. We’ll have a target on our backs; we’ll have new freshmen, and guys will have to step up. We’re optimistic, but realistic.”

The Harvard women’s water polo team finished with an 18-16 record, its best mark since 2005, and a large reason for such newfound success was the emergence of junior attacker Shayna Price.
 
After a sophomore season in which she found the back of the net 40 times, Price nearly doubled her total to finish with 76 goals.
 
The Honolulu, Hawaii native was a consistent source of offense for the Crimson, as she failed to register a goal in only three of the team’s 34 games this season.
 
“I think I maybe had more confidence in how I played,” Price said. “I trusted my teammates so that I was able to take more shots than I normally would.”
 
Price notched at least four goals in nine games this year. Her top offensive performance came in the first game of the season against Iona, when she netted six goals to lead the Crimson to a 15-13 win.
 
The junior scored five times and amassed two steals against Cal State Bakersfield in early April, and she led the team with four goals in a game against No. 5 California.
 
After a big weekend in which Price registered a six-point performance against Santa Clara and the Crimson won three of its four games, Price was named CWPA Southern Division Co-Player of the Week.
 
Price finished with 33 assists and 39 steals on the year. Her 76 goals were second best on the team, just three behind her older sister, co-captain Aisha Price.
 
“It’s just an amazing opportunity to play with my sister,” Aisha Price said. “I have a lot of respect for her as a player. She always really performs during games, and she really thrives in pressure situations.”
 
“She probably has the best shot on our team, by far,” Aisha Price added. “She’s always working to create offensive opportunities to get her shot and help other players get their shot as well. I know that next year all of [our opponents] will be looking out for her.”
 
Shayna Price’s emergence as a scorer to be reckoned with paid dividends for the relatively small Crimson squad of ten players.
 
“I think that our team this year really went after it and nobody was afraid that if you missed it you’d get in trouble,” Price said. “We all just put our heart into every shot and every play, and that’s what really helped us this season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Dec. 11, he was “brilliant” and a “savior.” On Jan. 12, he “[made] things happen.” On March 8, it was his “moxie, his savvy, [and] his daring” that were noteworthy.
While Harvard men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker’s descriptions of Siyani Chambers continually changed, one thing remained the same throughout the season: the freshman point guard’s poise in late-game moments.
There may not have been any chance for Chambers to prove himself in clutch situations had the departure of senior Brandyn Curry not created an opening at the guard position. Given the opportunity, though, Chambers began every game as the sole rookie in the Crimson starting lineup and closed each contest in a manner that was more fitting of a player with years of experience.
As a result, Chambers won Ivy League Rookie of the Year honors unanimously and was selected to the conference’s first team; the first ever rookie so honored.
“We said at the beginning of the season that there’s no one more important on our team than that kid, given the circumstances [and] the position,” Amaker said the week that Chambers was selected for those awards. “[He’s] how our team has been able to have some success this year. He’s been the leader of that. He’s been in the middle of it. He’s made timely plays, big shots, winning baskets.”
One of the earliest indications of Chambers’s late-game abilities came against Boston University on Dec. 11. With his team trailing throughout the contest, Chambers came out of intermission looking to score. After three made shots from beyond the arc, including an and-one four-point play, the freshman not only brought his team back from a late deficit, but set up an opportunity to win the game.
After setting the table for a chance at a victory, Chambers then delivered the victory when he hit a jumper from the wing to win the game, 65-64.
The basket itself was one of many impressive moments for Chambers, but it was his consistent presence that was on display in that game—and throughout the season—that proved most valuable to Harvard. Firstly, the point guard played a total of 39 minutes against the Terriers, just over a minute above his season average of 37.8 minutes per game, a number that led all freshmen in the nation. Secondly, Chambers’ hot shooting from deep that day speaks to the 42.7 percent three-point field goal percentage he amassed throughout the year, good for fifth in the conference.
“We say that if you say the right things and play the right way, you will be amazed at how well you perform on the offensive end,” Amaker said. “Siyani is a great example of that. ”
Against Dartmouth, in Harvard’s first Ivy game of the season, it once again required a double-digit second half from Chambers to gain momentum and the lead. After an and-one that tied the game with seven and a half minutes remaining, Chambers both scored and dished out the ball, leading to a career-high 22 points as well as six assists. The latter statistic was on pace with Chambers’ 5.61 assists-per-game season average, a figure that placed him second among all rookies nationally.
“I was just really anxious to come out here and do what I could [to] help my teammates win in order to get our first victory in the Ivy League,” Chambers said after the contest.
It was, perhaps, the week after one of Chambers’ weakest set of games that the cliché “experience beyond his years” resonated the most strongly. After going a combined 5-of-19 at Princeton and Penn, Chambers entered the final weekend of the season having not shot 50 percent in four weeks of play. With a chip on his shoulder, the rookie shot at an 83 percent clip against Columbia in the Friday night matchup, willing his team to yet another squeaked-out victory.
For the third time in as many down-to-the-wire games, it was a Chambers and-one that helped propel the Crimson to the winner’s circle.
Down two with just over 40 seconds remaining in the game, Chambers received an outlet pass from sophomore Steve Moundou-Missi on their opponent’s right wing. Chambers went in for the layup, despite getting fouled, giving Harvard a lead that his squad would never relinquish.
With the win, Harvard took back first place in the Ivy League standings, ultimately earning it a spot in the NCAA Tournament.
“I said it all along and I said it to our team, I don’t know who is the best player on the roster,” Amaker said.  “I’m not sure there is a more important player than Siyani and that’s who he has been for us. It’s easy for me to say that now, but a while ago, at the beginning of the season, I remember thinking that considering the circumstances and all the things I knew about how incredibly important he was going to be.”
On Dec. 11, Amaker asked the question “What can you say about Siyani?” On March 8, he answered that question for himself as he declared that “you can’t say enough about Chambers.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Senior running back Treavor Scales couldn’t sleep. He was normally sound asleep by 10 o’clock the night before games, but this time was different. As the hours ticked away before Scales’ final collegiate contest in The Game, all he could do was stare at the ceiling.
The night before, the Georgia native explained the importance of the game during the team’s senior speeches.
“At six seconds per play, you got about 60 plays out there,” Scales remembers telling his team. “That’s six minutes of actual playing time you’ve got left in your career. Use those six minutes to the fullest.”
Thinking about those six minutes kept Scales up until around midnight, and he was back awake by 6 a.m. on the cool November morning, raring to go. The stakes for the day were clear.
The Game would be his perfect stage. In front of 30,000 fans stuffing Harvard Stadium and many more watching the national television broadcast, Scales and the Crimson would take on Yale, led by former Harvard assistant Tony Reno.
Scales had functioned mainly as a third-down option during his first two seasons before serving in a rotation with then-freshman Zach Boden in 2011. His senior year was the only time he served as the workhorse back he always wanted to be, and though he started the year strongly, his production had tapered off as the season neared its end.
In the five weeks prior to The Game, the Crimson had lost its spot atop the Ivy League, going 3-2 as Scales averaged just over 60 yards and gained 90 yards only once, in a devastating loss to Princeton. Scales now had one final chance to establish his Harvard legacy.
Leading up to kickoff, there was a lot on Scales’ mind.
“It was pandemonium,” Scales says. “All kind of butterflies…. It was almost rattling.”
Scales recalls hoping that everything would go right in his final Crimson chapter. It didn’t. He accrued just 13 yards in the first quarter and entered halftime with fewer than 40 yards. Both offenses struggled in what was a 3-3 stalemate after 30 minutes.
Scoring opened up in the second half, but Scales wasn’t the one making things happen. In the third quarter, he only had five carries and only gained more than four yards on one of them.
He finally got things going in the fourth quarter. Back-to-back-to-back handoffs to Scales on the Crimson’s first possession of the fourth quarter netted Harvard 25 yards and set up a play-action touchdown pass on the following play.
Then the ball was taken out of Scales’ hands. He got just one touch over the next eight and a half minutes as the Bulldogs and Crimson battled back and forth, each grabbing the lead only to surrender it back.
At that point, it was unclear how many more active seconds of Harvard football Scales had left.
“I just wanted a shot,” Scales recalls. “Inside my head I’m like, ‘I can’t wait to get my shot more than anything. As soon as they do hand me this ball, I’m going to make something happen.’”
The next time Scales showed up in the play-by-play came with the Crimson holding a 27-24 lead, attempting to run out the remaining 3:19 on the clock. On the first play of that drive, he was called for holding, negating a seven-yard rush by senior quarterback Colton Chapple and forcing the Crimson into a first-and-20 situation. One play later, Scales made up for the error, protecting the football after Chapple fumbled it.
“Those minutes with that start to a drive was kind of rattling,” Scales says. “You think about all those college football games you’ve watched where it’s like epic comebacks in the last few minutes of the game, and you’re like, ‘This cannot be one of those situations.’”
After a three-yard rush set up third and 13 at the Harvard 37, Scales was tasked with making sure Yale wouldn’t have a chance to pull off the comeback. The ensuing play lasted just 10 seconds out of the roughly six minutes of field action Scales estimates he saw weekly, but it would come to define his Harvard legacy.
The play call was “stud right 26 flipback.” It was an inside zone run that highlighted the strengths of the Harvard offense: Chapple keeping the defense honest, the dominant offensive line creating a seam up the middle, and do-everything H-back Kyle Juszczyk coming across to block a charging defender. That left Scales to do the rest.
Breaking through the line, he remembers thinking the run would probably net the team the requisite 13 yards but little more. Yet Scales shook an oncoming defender and junior wide receiver Andrew Berg blocked another downfield, allowing Scales to bounce the run to the outside. When he got there, he was surprised by what he saw.
“After I made that cut to the outside, my eyes bugged,” Scales says. “I was like, man, there is nobody out here. There is not a soul out here…. At that point I was like, well, there is one thing you can do here, and you better not get caught.”
Though the crowd was going crazy at that point, Scales couldn’t hear anything but the rattling of his face mask and his striding legs.
Then he heard the breath of the defender chasing him and felt the diving Yalie clip his heel, sending Scales struggling to keep his balance as he neared the goal line.
When his hearing returned, he was standing in the south end zone of Harvard Stadium, mobbed by teammates and cheered by fans.
“It was one of the greatest runs I’ve ever seen,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy says. “It was unbelievable.”
With his final run as a Crimson football player, Scales had put The Game out of reach, as Harvard emerged victorious, 34-24, after stopping Yale on the ensuing possession.
At the same time, Scales achieved a personal milestone. The back had entered the contest with 825 rushing yards on the season. Joking with Juszczyk pre-game, he made a serious declaration.
“I was telling him, ‘Juice, I have every intention of getting 1,000 yards this season,’” Scales recalls. “‘I have to get it.’”
After Harvard gained its 24-20 lead, Scales was reminded that he had about 60 yards left to achieve the milestone. He remembers thinking it wouldn’t be easy to get there. A few plays later, his final 63-yard carry pushed him over the mark. He finished the season with 1,002 yards.
Ironically, it was Scales’ own mistake, the holding penalty he committed earlier on the drive, that set the team back 10 yards and allowed him to achieve the feat. On that day, everything ended up going right for Scales, as his final chapter ended in storybook fashion.
“It was unreal,” Scales says. “It was really a surreal moment to be a part of.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite capturing a fourth-straight Ivy League crown this winter, the Princeton women’s basketball was denied a perfect 14-0 conference season. The sole blemish on its Ancient Eight record was Harvard, who dealt the Tigers their first Ivy loss in two years and snapped a 33-game winning streak.
 
“It was a double-win in my opinion,” Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “Princeton played very well and we just weathered the storm. It was mental, not physical, really.”
 
On March 1, a streak came to an end as Crimson senior forward Victoria Lippert came up big at the charity stripe at home in Lavietes Pavilion.
 
“We definitely do pressure free-throw shooting in practice so that in a game like the Princeton game, we are able to cope with a situation like that,” Lippert said.
 
Hitting four of four attempts in the final 40 seconds of the contest, Lippert protected Harvard’s lead from the line and showed why she was the Ivy League’s top free throw shooter this season. The Crimson went on to win the contest, 58-55.
 
Lippert, who went a perfect 10-of-10 on free throws and put up a game-high 21 points, came up with the sharp shooting, but much of the Harvard’s magic also came in defensive skills. The Crimson stifled Princeton powerhouse Niveen Rasheed, limiting the senior to just 13 points on the night, and held the team to just 25.8 percent shooting from the floor.
 
“Niveen puts the team on her back,” Delaney-Smith said. “She’s the best kind of player, that makes everyone better and makes everyone believe.”
 
Senior guard Elle Hagedorn, as well as sophomores Temi Fagbenle and Erin McDonnell, combined for a total of six blocks. Fagbenle proved aggressive on the glass, grabbing a team-high nine rebounds, seven of which came on the defensive end.
 
To seal the victory, Harvard withstood a scoring surge from the Tigers that saw Rasheed claim the first lead of the game for her team, 49-47, with two clutch free throws at the 3:27 mark in the closing frame.
 
Not even a month after breaking the program scoring record with 99 points at Yale, the Tigers saw their chance at a league title fall into jeopardy and Harvard found revenge after four straight losses to their conference rival.
 
“Princeton has done a great job believing they can’t lose,” Delaney-Smith said. “I can’t tell you how many teams...have come really close to being able to beat them but Princeton has established this belief in themselves that they can’t lose…. I think part of getting ourselves ready to play them was believing that we could win.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dave Fish ’72 has seen it all in his 37 years as the head coach of the Harvard men’s tennis team, and with such a wealth of experience comes great wisdom. This season, Fish’s insight and inspiring words proved to be crucial in binding his team together to win a second consecutive Ivy League crown.
Despite having only one senior, captain Andy Nguyen, and losing its No. 1 singles and doubles players from the previous season, the Crimson went 6-1 in Ancient Eight play and advanced to the Round of 32 in the NCAA tournament. Fish led his young team to as high as No. 16 in the national rankings en route to wrapping up his 21st Ivy League title as Harvard’s coach.
“Coach Fish has so much experience,” sophomore Shaun Chaudhuri said. “He’s not only concerned with making us better tennis players, but he also wants to make sure that we are better people.”
Fish believes that the most important part of his job is to inspire his players to be the best that they can be.
“There are three systems of rewards,” Fish said. “I can coerce you or incentivize you, but neither of those change people inside. But if you inspire them, they have to change inside. If we teach someone to be their best, to put their heart and soul into it, then watch out.”
Fish’s focus on teaching his players dedication has paid dividends by building a team of players that could count on each other.
“From the coaches’ point of view, this year was great,” Fish said. “Not only did they know how to win, but they were remarkably good with each other. If someone else didn’t have it that day, someone else would click.”
The team continually picked itself up, especially in doubles, where it won 19 doubles points in 25 matches, including a midseason stretch of 12 straight matches.
Fish credits his players and assistant coaches Andrew Rueb and Eric Butorac with creating an atmosphere for the success the team has had this season.
“As coaches, we don’t teach them much,” Fish said. “Our job is to create the climate where you can pull the rods on the nuclear reactor until you have the power to light up a city. I’m very grateful to have Reub and Butorac. It’s not Dave Fish doing the work. We have a whole group pulling a boat in the same direction.”
Together, the tennis coaching staff has led the team to Ivy titles and success on a national stage.
“The coaches play a huge role,” Nguyen said. “Dave and Rueb are unbelievable. Rueb is so passionate, and Dave is very wise and insightful. The guys don’t realize how lucky they are to play for them. They’re two of the best coaches in the nation.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the Harvard women’s volleyball team commenced Ivy League play, it had some work to do. After a series of losses to non-conference opponents, the squad arrived in Hanover, N.H., for its first conference game on Sept. 21 with a 2-8 record.
While the Crimson fell to Dartmouth, it didn’t let a lack of momentum ruin its league season as it finished 7-7, its best record since 2009.
For the third consecutive year, the team looked to captain Taylor Docter, who led the team with 281 kills on the season. The outside hitter ended her career ranked seventh in Harvard history in kills.
“A lot of matches came down to the last couple of points,” Crimson coach Jen Weiss said. “Taylor Docter and [senior] Beth Kinsella were our senior leaders in that, and they did a great job putting us back up into the top tier, which was what the goal was.”
To close out the season, Docter and Kinsella both recorded double-doubles in their final match, a four-set win at Brown that gave Weiss her 100th Ivy League win.
Weiss, who is the winningest and longest-tenured coach in the program’s history, also earned her 250th career victory the previous weekend versus Cornell.
“It’s nice to play for someone who you trust,” sophomore outside hitter Kristen Casey said. “She’s very motherly and caring, and I think that’s something that’s unique about her.”
Weiss, who has now coached 21 seasons in Cambridge, was tasked with the job of converting the raw talent of four freshmen into a cohesive team unit. The women quickly adapted to the team and entered the rotation.
Outside hitter Kathleen Wallace was the runner-up in kills, as was setter Hannah Schmidt in assists. Middle blocker Caroline Holte set the pace in assists, while outside hitter Jennifer Shults reached a career high of eight kills twice.
“All four of the freshmen were in the lineup at some point,” Weiss said. “I think that they’re a very talented group of girls.... I’m excited for their careers as we move along. I think we had a good mix of freshmen and upperclassmen for this season, and the chemistry on the court was very good with that group.”
For the first time since 2009, the team had a road sweep of Cornell and Columbia on Oct. 12 and 13. The New York conference rivals pose a unique challenge because of the length and distance of the trip.
“[A season highlight was] the road trip to Cornell and Columbia,” Weiss said. “I don’t remember the last time we went 2-0 on that road trip. We beat Cornell on Friday, and then Columbia we did a fabulous job with on Saturday. It was a great match, and we beat them in three [sets].”
After the graduation of four-time All-Ivy player Christine Wu ’12 and classmate Sandra Lynne Fryhofer, both instrumental in defense at libero and middle blocker, respectively, Weiss had to adjust the defensive scheme to combat opponent attacks, utilizing Docter and junior right side hitter Erin Cooney to do so.
“We had a new blocking system that we did, a twin blocking system, and I thought that was very effective,” Weiss said. “We have some great jumpers.”
The team also faced the loss of sophomore Tara MacLean, who suffered a career-ending injury early in the season and will serve as manager next year yet still managed to finish with its strongest conference record in several seasons.
“I think we definitely did grow and learn over the season because by the end we really came together for Ivy competition,” Weiss said. “Because we did have an injury, we did have a player take a year off, we had to make some adjustments in the beginning, but we all came together at the end, and it worked out well.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the scoreboard displayed Harvard 34, Princeton 10 with 13 minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, it seemed as if the football game was all but over.
But the Tigers never quit. On Oct. 20 at Princeton Stadium, the home team ran off 29 straight points, including a 36-yard touchdown pass with 13 seconds to go to take the lead for the first time all game.
The desperation throw from the Tigers’ second string quarterback, Quinn Epperly, capped a 90-yard drive that gave the then-No. 20 Crimson its first defeat of the season.
“I was standing on the sideline as if I was a fan watching the game,” senior running back Treavor Scales said. “It was surreal how everything was happening and how everything they did was working and how everything just fell into place.”
Harvard left a number of potential points on the field, as miscues such as a blocked 22-yard field goal, a blocked extra point, and a fumble in Tigers’ territory would come back to haunt the Crimson.
“It was one of the worst bus rides I’ve ever had in my entire football career, like from little league all the way up to now,” Scales said. “Dead silence; nobody spoke the entire way home. We were all awestruck; we didn’t understand what had just happened.”
The Harvard defense shut out its opponents in the first half, holding the Tigers to only 51 yards while the Crimson amassed 415 yards of its own to secure a 20-point lead heading into the break.
But the momentum completely reversed in the fourth quarter, as Princeton scored touchdowns through the air on four consecutive drives to take the lead.
Despite senior quarterback Colton Chapple throwing for a program-record 448 yards—192 of which went to tight end Kyle Juszczyk—the Crimson offense gained only 78 yards in the fourth quarter and could not keep the Tigers off the field.
“I feel like I was too conservative in my play calling in the four-minute drill,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “It was kind of textbook play calling…. But whatever your gut tells you, you need to do in that specific situation. So at the end of the day, very simply, it’s all on me.”
What seemed to be an easy win for the Crimson turned into a season-defining loss as the Tigers offense became unstoppable down the stretch.
“I don’t even like to talk about it,” Murphy said. “I couldn’t eat for two days. I was just sick to my stomach, as sick as I’ve ever been because it was just one of those ones that you’ll just never forget.”

For the Harvard men’s swimming and diving team, the season wasn’t perfect, but it sure was close.
“I think I’d say this season was a pretty incredible one from the standpoint of this team taking it to another level, in terms of commitment and the achievement of individuals,” co-captain Owen Wurzbacher said.
A runner-up finish at the Ivy League Championships was perhaps the only negative in what was an otherwise groundbreaking season for the Crimson, which went a perfect 9-0 in dual meets on the season, including an unblemished 7-0 against Ivy League competition.
Harvard secured the Ivy League dual meet title on the heels of a record-breaking win against Princeton, when the Crimson became the first Ancient Eight team ever to beat the Tigers in their home pool.
“I think we will take confidence from that win,” Wurzbacher said. “It gives us faith in our abilities.”
The Crimson won 14 of 19 events at the HYP meet and set three school records en route to the victory.
“[We gained] a level of confidence in having achieved that [win],” sophomore Chuck Katis said. “I think we know what we can do. I think that was one of the pinnacles of this season, to walk in and beat that team, and on that day, we were better than them.”
Harvard went on to clinch the dual meet title with a win against Penn two weeks later and rode a wave of confidence heading into the Ivy League Championships. The Crimson looked to upset the four-time defending champion Tigers, and for a while, it looked like they might do just that.
But Princeton would not falter down the stretch and edged Harvard despite strong performances across the board by the Crimson.
“Obviously, when you look back, you tend to focus on some of the things that didn’t go perfectly, or the things you wish you could’ve done better,” Wurzbacher said. “But I think as a team, we really excelled.”
Harvard set six school records at the Ivy League championship meet and won eight league titles over the course of the weekend en route to its second- place finish in the meet. The results were emblematic of the strong performances by Harvard over the course of the entire season.
“We accomplished a lot of great things,” Katis said. “We had 10 team records broken this season, so that was a pretty big step forward, and we had the biggest team we’ve sent to NCAA’s in a long time. [We] had some great performances, not only on the swimming side, but also on the diving side all across the board, from ECAC’s to Ivy’s and then even NCAA’s.”
Katis was one of the six Crimson swimmers who represented Harvard at the 2013 NCAA Championships. Classmate Michael Mosca became the first Crimson diver to qualify for the meet in 10 years after finishing second in the one-meter and fourth in the three-meter at the NCAA Zone A Diving Championships.
An untimely illness hampered Katis during the national championship meet, and Harvard failed to make the finals in any event, but the Crimson turned in a strong effort at the season-ending meet, posting five top-30 finishes.
“Every year, stuff happens,” Katis said. “I don’t think overall we represented ourselves as well on the national level as we probably should have. But it’s in the past, and the work that we did will 100 percent show up this next year.”
The 2012-13 season was nonetheless a groundbreaking year for Harvard, as it  was ranked as high as No. 16 in the national polls at one point.
“I think the culture of commitment we’ve put together is something very special and something that I think will last into the future,” Wurzbacher said. “I’m really proud to have been a part of the team, and I know the future years will be even better than this one was.”
The Crimson will look to pick up where it left off next season as Harvard works to regain its position atop the Ivy League and make a splash against some of the nation’s best in the water.
“The big goals of next season are to keep the momentum moving,” Katis said. “We’ve made some great steps this year, and those are just the first steps to something bigger that we’re going to achieve here.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard women’s tennis has shown that the future is bright, finishing with a 13-6 record and concluding the season on a four-match win streak behind stellar play from four freshmen.
Freshman Amy He stepped into the No. 2 singles spot for the Crimson this year and played her way to a 16-9 overall record and a spot on the All-Ivy second team.
Fellow rookies Hai-Li Kong and Amanda Lin went undefeated in conference play at the No. 4 and No. 6 singles spots, respectively. Kong finished the year 21-5 overall while Lin finished at 26-3 on the season. Lin and Kong were also voted MVPs by the team for their play throughout the year.
“I think with Amanda, Amy, Hai-Li, it just speaks to their effort in practice because everything paid off in their matches,” Harvard coach Traci Green said. “It speaks to the strength of that class. They were learning on the spot, and they did a great job for us this year.”
Though rookies were an integral part of the winning season for Harvard, they were not the sole reason behind the Crimson’s success. One has to look no further than co-captains Kristin Norton and Hideko Tachibana to see this to be true.
Tachibana finished the year 16-10 playing No. 1 singles for Harvard and earned first-team All-Ivy honors. Norton, meanwhile, finished 13-8 on the year while playing the No. 3 singles spot for the Crimson. The senior co-captains also combined to go 9-5 as doubles partners and finished second at the Columbia Invitational in the doubles A flight. Despite their individual successes, this year’s senior class was the first class in the program to graduate without capturing an Ivy League title since 1983.
“We are really going to miss our senior captains a lot,” Green said. “They have given a lot to our team, and their energy and spirit will definitely be missed. They have worked very hard, and we will miss their vocal support in practice.”
Tachibana and Norton were not the only Harvard players to find success at the Columbia Invitational, which served as the first match of the year for the team on Sept. 14. Lin won the singles C flight and fellow rookie Crystal Yen won the singles D flight.
The biggest win for the Crimson this year came April 21 against then-No. 35 Yale. The Bulldogs came into the match undefeated in the Ivy League. Harvard won, 5-2, and was the only Ancient Eight team to defeat the eventual champions.
“One of our highlights this season was beating Yale, which was a huge accomplishment because it has been a couple of years since we beat them,” Tachibana said. “In terms of how much we fought and put everything on the line, we really just exceeded expectations across the board this year, so I am very proud of our team and the way we competed this year.”
Once again, it was a rookie that rose to the occasion for the Crimson, as He battled off two match points against opponent Madeline Hamilton before eventually winning, 4-6, 6-1, 7-6(7), to clinch the victory for Harvard.
The Crimson started the day off strongly by taking the doubles point, with Tachibana and Lin winning at No. 1 and Norton and sophomore Sylvia Li winning at No. 2.  Harvard also earned wins at the No. 4, 5, and 6 singles spots from Kong, Li, and Lin, respectively, to knock off the Bulldogs.
He’s win to clinch the match is representative of what the four freshmen did for the team all season.
“[The freshmen] didn’t really have time to transition to college tennis because as soon as they joined the team, they had to become an integral part,” Tachibana said. “I think they were able to come in and play really well, and they held up the team through a lot of really tough times.”
Having played in such high-stakes matches this season should only help the talented freshman class moving forward.
“I’m very proud of how resilient we were as a team during the Ivy season in general,” Green said. “Each match, we got stronger and stronger and learned something new. It was very important because we were a very young squad, and it was great to see that development at the end of the season. It was fun to be a part of this team’s journey.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If it were possible to mute the frenzied crowd at the end of regulation, the only audible sound would have been that of a dozen pencils in the hands of sportswriters furiously erasing their ledes.
With 10 points separating Dartmouth and Harvard and only 93 seconds left in regulation, the story was already written. Dartmouth, a scrappy squad that had hung tight with Harvard earlier in the year, had finally gotten over the hump and dealt a serious blow to the Crimson’s chances to repeat as Ivy League champions. Harvard junior co-captain Laurent Rivard was the face of the frustrating afternoon, hitting none of his six three-point attempts and even clanging his lone free throw try.
But luckily for the Crimson, sporting events have a way of bucking the narrative.
A three-pointer from co-captain Christian Webster seemed to allow Harvard to save some face, cutting the deficit to 57-50, and the Crimson quickly fouled to send the Big Green’s Gabas Maldunas to the line for a one-and-one. Maldunas whiffed, and soon sent Rivard to the line with a foul on a trey attempt. Harvard had halved the deficit in little more than 20 seconds. After the two teams exchanged buckets, another Webster three with 41 seconds to play brought the game to within one possession, 60-57, and caused the interested murmur from the crowd to rise to barely-believing shouts. Yet another Harvard foul and two Big Green free throws raised the margin back to five.
Then Lavietes Pavilion lost its collective mind.
With 32 seconds remaining, Webster buried another three-pointer from the top of the key, his third in the space of a minute. Sophomore Wesley Saunders fouled Dartmouth’s John Golden, sending him to the line for two shots. With the crowd at full volume, Golden missed the first. Then he missed the second, with the rebound falling to Rivard, who quickly dumped it to point guard Siyani Chambers. The freshman raced down the court, blew past Dartmouth guard Malik Gill, and slashed into the vacated interior to lay the ball in and tie up the score. A roaring crowd and a missed three-pointer on the other end sent the game and NBC Sports’ programming schedule into overtime.
“Our shots weren’t falling [early in the game], so they were able to collapse in the paint a lot,” Webster said after the game. “Then when I made a couple shots...Siyani was free to drive, made a good move, and got to the basket.”
There wasn’t a whole lot of drama left over for the extra period. A 6-0 run sparked by a Rivard three—his first made field goal of the game—gave the Crimson its first lead since 2-0, one it would not relinquish for the rest of the contest. All that Harvard required was some composure at the free throw line, which Rivard, Chambers, and Saunders delivered, sealing the win and allowing the Crimson to breathe a massive sigh of relief.
“One of the crazy things about the game of basketball is that you have to play it out,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “We practice certain things to be in those positions. Do they always go perfectly? No, but we practice those kind of moments.”
Had the Crimson’s comeback bid fallen short, the team would have been dealt its first Ivy loss of the season in a game it was heavily favored to win, putting it at a disadvantage in what was to be a tense struggle with Princeton for the conference crown. Harvard ultimately prevailed over the Tigers for the Ivy title by one game.
The late game swings reminded Amaker of two occasions earlier in the season in which his team was on the other side of the comeback. On Dec. 31, Harvard had a 10-point lead over Saint Mary’s with less than four minutes to play and, on Nov. 13, it held a five-point advantage over UMass with a minute and a half remaining. The Crimson lost both games.
“It’s so tough to have been in the position Dartmouth is in right now, where they played their hearts out in a lot of ways and deserved to win,” Amaker said after the game. “I think it’s very obvious how well they played until the last minute or two minutes.”
In the home locker room, there would be time later to make adjustments; for the moment, there was only the sweet thrill of escape.
“I haven’t been a part of anything like that since the Brown game a couple years ago,” Webster said after the game, referring to the Crimson’s 24-point comeback against the Bears in 2011. “It was ridiculous. I’m at a loss for words right now.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two minutes into the fourth quarter at Tigers Stadium, the Harvard football team looked invincible. Senior quarterback Colton Chapple had just fired a pass to junior tight end Cameron Brate, who broke two tackles en route to a touchdown that put the Crimson ahead of Princeton, 34-10.
A win, then seemingly a foregone conclusion for a dominant Harvard team, would solidify the Crimson atop the Ivy League as the only undefeated squad. But then things came apart.
Five plays after a sack was negated for an excessive celebration penalty that gave the Tigers a first down, Princeton’s second string quarterback, Quinn Epperly, threw for only his second career touchdown to give the Tigers their first lead of the game with thirteen seconds left.
“That sort of dismantling as an offense, the miscues that I had personally, it makes me sick watching that film because there’s so many opportunities, where you feel as if, ‘If I had made that play right there...’” senior running back Treavor Scales said. “It was a very humbling experience. We were rolling at that point, obviously, but it was a tough one to stomach.”
The following week, Cornell downed Princeton and Harvard responded with a victory over Dartmouth, giving the Crimson control of its own destiny once again. A 69-0 obliteration of Columbia the next week seemed to put Harvard back on track, setting up a title showdown with Penn.
But the team that had so convincingly demolished the Lions seemed absent from Franklin Field.  The Quakers recorded 227 rushing yards against the top-ranked rush defense in the FCS and sacked Chapple six times to hand the Crimson its second defeat.
“There really isn’t necessarily an explanation for it, it just wasn’t working  for us,” Scales said. “Whatever reason that was, you look back at the film, there were just certain mistakes that we didn’t usually make. It was just things that we knew exactly what to do, it just didn’t get done. And give a heck of a credit to Penn…they hit us in the mouth before we hit them.”
With losses to the Killer P’s, Harvard failed to meet high expectations set at the beginning of the season despite record-setting performances from key players.
“In all honesty, this is probably the best team we’ve had that didn’t win a championship, and that’s absolutely no one’s fault other than my own, and it’s as simple as that,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said. “This is a real good football team, and we had an inexplicable series of events in the fourth quarter of the Princeton game that ultimately stood between us and the championship. It would’ve been our fourth championship in six years.”
Chapple surpassed Neil Rose to snag the top spot in the record books for passing touchdowns in a season, shattering the previous record of 18 by throwing for 24 scores. Meanwhile, Scales recorded his first 1,000-yard season and the dual threat of senior tight end Kyle Juszczyk and Brate combined for over 1,200 yards receiving. But even these performances couldn’t return the Ancient Eight title to Cambridge.
“Talking to my roommate, the captain next year, Josh Boyd, we’ll just say, ‘What the hell happened? How, with the weapons, the mentality that we all had, how did we let that slip away?’” Scales said. “It’s still a question in all of our minds, how we don’t have a second ring on our finger. It boils down to should’ve, could’ve, would’ve, but it’s bizzare. It really is.”
With the championship now out of the Crimson’s control, one game remained—arguably, the biggest game of the year outside of the scope of the season. The Crimson didn’t disappoint.
A disjointed first 30 minutes led to a 3-3 tie at halftime, as Yale stifled the top offense in the Ivy League. But Chapple found his stride in the second half to complete clutch plays that ensured the Crimson would never trail in the game before Scales clinched the win with a breakaway 63-yard touchdown run.
“Essentially, there was nothing miraculous. We just weren’t doing a good job executing, and all of a sudden it just came together,” Murphy said of the second half resurgence. “We sustained drives, and we had to be at our best—fortunately, the latter part of the third quarter, the fourth quarter, we were.”
And for Scales, even without another ring, that final push was all that mattered.
“Five years from now, I’ll look every Yale football player in the face and say, ‘I beat you every year I was there,’” Scales said. “I’ll chalk that one up as a win. There were shortcomings, there were things we didn’t get done, but I don’t think it was ever a question of lack of effort.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Junior swimmer Sara Li took the blocks at NCAA Championships alone, but it was a team effort that got her there.
Li’s last races of the season were on the biggest stage of her career and marked a complete transformation from her sophomore season. The junior swam the 50, 100, and 200-yard freestyle races at the national meet and placed 37th, 38th, and 34th, respectively.
Although Li’s journey to the national stage ended with a loss to Princeton at Ivy League Championships, the co-captain had the performance of her career at Ivy’s and ECAC Championships the next day. She broke program or pool records in all three of her events and led the Crimson to victory in the 200-yard medley relay at Ivy’s.
“When I was [at NCAA’s], the whole time I was hoping my teammates would be able to join me next year,” Li said. “A lot of people had success this season, and I think that made me more successful.”
At Ivy League Championships, Li finished third in the 50-yard freestyle but set a school record with a time of 22.46 seconds. Leading off the 4x100-yard medley relay at ECAC Championships, Li set a program record, finishing in 48.67 seconds. Her time was the fastest at Blodgett Pool in 32 years, and Harvard finished fifth in the meet. Li also set a program record with a 1:45:88 finish in the 200 free.
After suffering from an injury as a sophomore, Li decided last spring to train for Olympic trials. Though she didn’t make it, the process was transformative.
According to Crimson coach Stephanie Wriede Morawski ’92, racing against herself and the clock gave Li the confidence and desire to train harder for the intercollegiate season.
“It flipped a switch in her. What she realized about herself is that she can swim very fast if she doesn’t put the pressure on herself,” Morawski said. “Once she realized that, it was more enjoyable for her to get in the pool and race.”
Morawski said she was not surprised by Li’s 50- and 200-yard times, but Li was able to swim the 100-yard freestyle about three-tenths of a second faster than Morawski expected.
This season marked the second time Harvard qualified two swimmers for the NCAA championships. But Li’s teammate, sophomore Courtney Otto, declined her invitation due to injury, leaving Li as the Crimson’s sole representative.
Li was not able to repeat her performances from Ivy League and ECAC competition in Indianapolis, where she finished in the middle of the field in all three of her races. She finished the 50-yard freestyle in 22.75 seconds, the 100-yard freestyle in 49.50 seconds, and the 200-yard freestyle in 1:46:98 seconds.
Named as one of three co-captains at the end of last season, Li came to the meet having taken on a much greater leadership role on the team.
“A big part of it is leading by example,” Morawski said. “She’d get into the water and instead of being comfortable going second or third, she would step up and go first. She held herself accountable, and that inspired those around her.”
This year, all three improvements on Li’s personal bests came in freestyle events, and she also helped the team win the 200-yard medley relay at Ivy League Championships with her freestyle leg. She swam the 200-yard freestyle 0.07 seconds off the current program record, finishing in 1:46:48 before breaking that record at ECAC’s. Li rounded out her meet by finishing third in the 400-yard medley relay.
Behind Li, the team went undefeated in its dual meet season and came in sixth at both the UGA Fall Invitational and the Georgia Tech Invitational in November. Although Harvard failed to repeat as Ivy League champions, the Crimson won its fifth mid-major title, awarded by CollegeSwimming.com, in 11 years.
“Overall it was an awesome season,” Li said. “We were able set off the energy of the freshman coming in and we really fed off of that. We tried to carry the momentum from last year.”
Li was awarded the Sharon Beckman Award by her teammates and coaches, which goes to the most outstanding and dedicated swimmer on the team. The junior said that being named a captain changed her mindset and made her more dedicated and committed to the team.
“This season as a captain I wanted to step up and lead my team, not only mentally, but also swim fast and inspire people that way,” Li said. “I was happier to contribute points to the team rather than win my own title.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the end, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team had 30 seconds to turn around its season. Down one goal to No. 15 Yale with less than a minute to play in the final frame of regulation of the final game of the regular season, the Crimson’s highly efficient man-up unit took the field.
Harvard cycled the ball around the perimeter, giving it to Henry Mumford just outside the crease. As the game clock dipped under 25 ticks, the walk-on senior teed up Harvard’s most important shot of the season from point-blank range.
But the ball caught the leg of Bulldog goalkeeper Eric Natale and bounced wide. With 14 seconds left, sophomore power-play specialist Murphy Vandervelde ripped one last outside shot, which Natale easily corralled. The buzzer sounded as Yale walked away with an 11-10 victory.
With the win, the Bulldogs landed the second seed in the Ivy League Tournament, which they would go on to win. The Crimson, meanwhile, missed the postseason for the second straight year.
The final half-minute of Harvard’s season succinctly summarized a frustrating spring of close calls and missed opportunities. In a year of highs and lows, the Crimson elevated its game and went toe-to-toe with top-ranked competition, only to fall short at key junctures.
“We were competitive, and we were really close to turning some of those losses into wins,” coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “While on paper it wasn’t what we had hoped, I think that we played some great lacrosse for long periods of the season, and our guys certainly can be proud of that.”
Cornell and Duke met in Philadelphia on May 25 for the first game of the Division I NCAA tournament’s semifinals with a spot in the national championship on the line. Less than two months ago, Harvard had both the Blue Devils and the Big Red on the ropes late in the second half.
On March 30, the Crimson led then-No. 10/12 Duke at Soldier’s Field Stadium by two with less than eight minutes of regulation to play before the Blue Devils clawed back for a 12-11 win. A week later, Harvard held a three-goal lead at home with less than 10 minutes to play before then-No. 2 Cornell scored five unanswered down the stretch to win, 14-12.
In hindsight, the tight games against the national semifinalists speak to the talent of the 2013 Crimson squad. Yet that home stand, which also included a 16-7 rout at the hands of Albany, was perhaps the toughest stretch of Harvard’s season.
“It was a very frustrating time because we knew we had the ability,” captain Jason Gonos said. “We knew we could have won those games, but at the end of the day, we didn’t.”
The Crimson rebounded with impressive wins over Quinnipiac and then-No. 16/14 Penn. The latter game, a 9-8 overtime victory at home, represented the high point of the team’s spring. A game-winner from Vandervelde on the man-up staved off a late Quaker comeback and put Harvard back in the Ivy League playoff hunt.
“I’d definitely say that the highlight of our season was winning against Penn in overtime,” Gonos said. “It was definitely a culmination of a lot of hard work, so it felt very good to get that win.”
Harvard entered the season having to adjust to big-name departures and a new defensive system. But veteran leadership and breakout performances allowed the Crimson to match its record from the previous season and nearly pull off some major upsets.
The Class of 2013 came up big for the Crimson this year. Senior Alex White paced the Crimson in goals scored with 22. Classmate Harry Krieger was a consistent presence in goal for Harvard, and Gonos served as the Crimson’s first solo captain since 2000.
Freshman attackman Devin Dwyer and classmate defenseman Robert Duvnjak, both named top-five recruits by Inside Lacrosse, made an immediate impact in their first season with the Crimson. Dwyer led the team in points (43) and assists (27) to capture All-New England Rookie of the Year honors. Duvnjak led Harvard in ground balls.
Vandervelde and junior attackman Peter Schwartz had breakout seasons for the Crimson. Vandervelde entered the season with no collegiate goals to his name and was held scoreless through the season’s first six games before exploding for hat tricks against Penn, Duke, and Albany. Schwartz was second on the team with 18 goals after scoring four in his sophomore season.
Next year, the Crimson will have to contend with an increasingly talented Ivy League that made major strides on the national stage this year. But Gonos believes that the team is headed in the right direction.
“They are returning a number of guys all over the field, and the guys coming back and the guys coming in as freshmen are all great players and have all proven themselves in all different ways,” Gonos said. “I see us definitely getting over the hump next year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Entering the 2012-13 season, there were few things the Harvard men’s basketball program had yet to accomplish.
In the previous three years, the Crimson had achieved its first 20-win campaign in 2009-10, won its first Ivy League title in 2010-11, and appeared in its first NCAA Tournament since 1946 in 2011-12.
Coming into this season, only one significant unchecked box remained on the team’s list of goals—winning a game in March Madness.
But on March 21, that milestone was finally reached when the Crimson stunned the college basketball world with a 68-62 win over New Mexico. The victory over the third-seeded Lobos turned the No. 14 Crimson into an early tournament Cinderella and marked the squad’s first-ever victory over a team ranked in the Associated Press Top 10.
“This is the type of thing you dream about in your backyard,” sophomore Wesley Saunders said after the contest. “For it to actually happen now is incredible.”
At the beginning of the season, few gave the Crimson a chance of achieving that goal.
Before the squad had even played its first game, the team’s co-captains, seniors Kyle Casey and Brandyn Curry, left the College after being implicated in the Government 1310 cheating scandal.
Their departures cost Harvard its leading scorer and a first-team All-Ivy forward in Casey and its floor general and assists and steals leader in Curry. Only a trio of inexperienced sophomores—Kenyatta Smith, Steve Moundou-Missi, and Jonah Travis—remained at the forward position, while rookie Siyani Chambers was the best remaining option at point guard.
But despite the voids left by the departure of his two stars, Amaker told his team that it still had enough talent to compete.
“We might not have what we had, but we have enough,” Amaker repeatedly said, and the squad, picked in the preseason to finish second behind Princeton in the conference, took that message to heart as a number of players elevated their games in the absence of their two talented teammates.
Chambers ran the offense like a seasoned veteran and surpassed all expectations, leading the nation’s freshmen in assists and minutes per game. The rookie point guard scored 21 points in Harvard’s fifth-straight win over Boston College, hit a game-winning jumper with four seconds remaining against Boston University, and poured in 22 to rally the Crimson to a road win at Dartmouth in its first league contest.
“It was beautiful to see how he was able to perform,” Amaker said. “Being a first-year kid, the impact he had was off the charts.”
Saunders improved his scoring output from 3.3 points per game as a freshman to an Ivy League-best 16.2 as a sophomore, tallying double-figures in every regular season contest while defending the opponent’s best perimeter scorer.
“We leaned on him so much,” Amaker said. “He was the best all-around player in our league.”
The young pair were both chosen to the All-Ivy League first team, with Chambers becoming the first freshman to ever receive that honor. Despite a grueling schedule, the duo helped Harvard go 8-6 during non-conference play, highlighted by a 67-62 road upset of California on Jan. 29.
The Crimson also received key contributions from co-captains Laurent Rivard, the junior who broke the program’s single-season three-point record, and Christian Webster, who provided valuable leadership as the team’s lone senior. Webster contributed some magical moments as well, most memorably when he hit three consecutive three-pointers to spark Harvard—down 10 with 93 seconds to go—to a dramatic overtime win over Dartmouth on Jan. 26.
But it was the late-season emergence of Smith, the talented sophomore center, which changed the entire dynamic of the squad. After getting benched following a slew of early-season turnovers, the former top recruit won his starting job back before a Feb. 15 home contest versus Penn. Against the Quakers, Smith delivered a stellar performance, registering a near-triple double with 20 points, a program-record 10 blocks, and nine rebounds. From there, the center never looked back, providing the team with the two-way interior presence it had lacked to that point.
Yet despite all the individual successes, a February loss at Columbia and a road sweep at the hands of Princeton and Penn in the season’s penultimate weekend meant the team still needed help to win its third-straight Ivy League title as it prepared for its final two games against Columbia and Cornell at Lavietes Pavilion.
The Crimson took care of business at home, storming back to beat the Lions, 56-51, and then knocking off the Big Red, 65-54, the following night.
Thanks to a Princeton loss to Yale the previous evening, the latter victory gave Harvard a share of the league championship, and within moments, when the Tigers were defeated again—this time by Brown—the Crimson had won the title outright and was headed to March Madness for the second consecutive year.
In Salt Lake City, behind 18 points from Saunders and 17 from Rivard, Harvard pulled the upset nobody saw coming. Though the Crimson had blown late second-half leads against the University of Massachusetts, Saint Mary’s, and Memphis during the regular season, the squad refused to back down against the Lobos, as it withstood a New Mexico run to take a one-point lead with six and a half minutes to play, answered right back, and closed down the stretch to earn the win.
Though Harvard was overmatched in its third-round contest, falling to sixth-seeded Arizona by a score of 74-51, its season as a whole, against all odds, was once again marked by the accomplishment of another major program first.
“It was a significant moment and achievement,” Amaker said. “[It’s] something that I’m incredibly proud of our kids for accomplishing.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
No record was safe when the Harvard women’s swimming and diving team jumped in the pool to compete this season.
Coming off a successful 2011-12 campaign that included an Ivy League title, the Crimson had high expectations. Harvard swept through its dual meet season undefeated and picked up a mid-major title given out by CollegeSwimming.com as program and pool records fell. But a slow start at the Ivy League Championships proved insurmountable, and Harvard finished second to Princeton.
“Everyone says they want to win, but saying it and believing it and working to achieve that are two different things,” Crimson coach Stephanie Wriede Morawski ’92 said. “Coming off [last year’s] win, you get tons of confidence immediately, and you know what it takes to do it again.”
Harvard kicked off its season with a bang in Ithaca, N.Y., extending its win streak over Cornell and Dartmouth to 28 and 32 meets, respectively. The Crimson broke eight pool records its first time out, and freshman Kendall Crawford broke the program record in the 100-yard backstroke with a time of 55.04 seconds.
A week later, Crawford was at it again. Swimming in Blodgett Pool for the first time in her career, Crawford shaved five-tenths of a second off her time to reset the record in the 100-yard backstroke. Classmate Danielle Lee set the record in the 50-yard backstroke at 25.92 seconds, the first time in Harvard history that a swimmer finished the event in less than 26 seconds.
“Freshman year is always a tough time transitioning, but the freshmen this year did an amazing job,” junior co-captain Sara Li said. “They just go with the flow, go with the adrenaline, and the team feeds off it.”
The 11 rookies quickly adjusted to swimming at the college level. According to Morawski, swimmers who competed at the club level in high school must refocus their priorities from racing against the clock to racing against one another.
Of the nine new program records that were set this season, freshmen were involved in five of them. In addition to her top times in the backstroke events, Crawford set the school mark in the 100-yard butterfly at Harvard’s final meet of the regular season against Yale and Princeton. The freshman also bested her own time in the 100-yard backstroke by more than a second.
Though the Crimson soundly defeated Princeton, 199-99, to close out the dual meet season, it could not repeat the performance at Ivy League Championships. Harvard fell to the Tigers, 1474.5-1374, at Princeton in its last conference competition of the year.
The first day of the meet ultimately doomed the Crimson, which fell 61.5 points behind Princeton. Senior diver Brittany Powell was the only winner on the night after qualifying in second place. She beat out Princeton’s top diver by more than 20 points for Harvard’s first title in the one-meter dive.
Li set a program record in the 50-yard freestyle, but she finished third in the event as one of the Crimson’s four top-five performances. Harvard gained ground on the second day with nine top-five finishes, but it was not enough to overtake Princeton.
“What I was most proud of was how they continued to fight back, even after being shaky the first morning,” Morawski said. “Coaches came up to me and told me they were incredibly impressed with the poise and unity they showed throughout the meets.”
The Crimson finished fifth at ECAC Open Championships, and Li set a pool and program record in the 100-yard freestyle, finishing in 48.67 seconds. Li’s victory was one of two for Harvard, and Crawford picked up the Crimson’s second win in the 200-yard backstroke.
Despite the loss at Ivy League Championships, Harvard earned three individual bids to the NCAA Championships. At Zone A Diving Championships, Powell qualified for the finals in both the one-meter and the three-meter event. She finished in 15th place overall in both.
Li and sophomore Courtney Otto qualified on the swimming side, but Otto declined the invitation due to injury. Li swam in all three freestyle events, and her best finish came in the 200-yard freestyle, in which she came in 34th with a time of 1:46.98 seconds.
Although Harvard was unable to repeat as Ivy League champions, Li said that she was satisfied with the season.
“We are a different group of people and a different kind of team,” Li said. “We knew our potential, and we wanted to have it as a benchmark, but we talked a lot about continuing to build our legacy, not trying to duplicate what we did last year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Melanie Baskind ’12 graduated, it was difficult to imagine how the Harvard women’s soccer and lacrosse teams would cope without the invaluable contributions of the former Harvard Crimson Athlete of the Year.
While Baskind, who led the women’s lacrosse team in assists, is certainly missed on both ends of the field, the Crimson looked to the freshmen, who quickly became a crucial component to the team, to replace her production.
“We were playing a lot of freshmen, but they stepped up when they had to,” captain Micaela Cyr said. “It was definitely a learning experience for them and a learning experience for all of us really.”
The season began with a number of challenges, including road games at then-No. 15 Cornell and then-No. 4 Northwestern, and the Crimson struggled to find a win during its first month of play.
“It was good because I feel like we improved over the season,” Cyr said. “Some of our best games were at the end of our season, and I think we ended really well against Columbia. The season didn’t go the way we wanted it to, but they’re very well set up for next year.”
Cyr, the team’s leading scorer who finished eighth in the Ivy League in points, led a talented attack/midfield unit which was third in the conference in shot percentage at 44.3 percent.
“We shoot the ball pretty well, so I’m pretty comfortable when we come up with the draw control and we’re on attack,” Harvard coach Lisa Miller said.
Freshmen Audrey Todd and Alexis Nicolia together started all but one game, providing consistent offensive intensity for the Crimson. Todd, who was named second team All-Ivy, registered a goal in 12 of 14 contests and had eight hat tricks. Nicolia opened her season at Stanford on Feb. 24 with five goals and nearly tied her career-high at Brown on April 6 with four goals.
“The freshman contribution was invaluable,” Cyr said. “Alexis and Audrey did very well on the offensive end. They just stepped right in and were able to contribute.”
Anchoring the defensive effort were freshmen Isabella Wager and Tory Waldstein. The pair started each game during the season and combined for nine forced turnovers and 20 ground balls.
“I think they did very well considering that they were tossed in and had to perform,” Cyr said. “They did very well considering that they were freshmen.”
Defense was crucial as the team struggled to keep opponents from scoring. Facing the absence of sophomore goalkeeper Kelly Weis, Harvard scrambled to fill the goal. In place of Weis, who had the empty net best save percentage (.474) in the league last season, senior Mel Cook returned to the team to play in 11 contests after a two-year absence. Sophomore Annie Meyjes played in her first four collegiate games, including a career-high 14-save performance at Stanford, while junior Jenn Hatfield, a goalie from the field hockey team, also chipped in on three separate occasions.
When the sharpshooting Crimson team did win, as it did three times, it did so decisively, using speed and athleticism to outmaneuver opponents for possessions. In victories against Marquette, Yale, and Columbia, which were all won by at least five goals, Harvard held a distinctive edge in ground balls.
“The things we talked about in practice everyday—the hustle, the ground balls, the draw controls—those are important because they lead to possessions, and you can’t score without the ball,” Cyr said. “Being good at them is really all about hustling and being free to stick your nose in and being able to take a hit. That was definitely a focus of ours during the season.”
Despite the raw talent shown by Crimson players, the squad did not advance to the four-team Ivy League tournament.
“When I was a freshman, and before that, Harvard lacrosse wasn’t on that national scene, but over the past few years, we’ve been able to raise our game, and our goal is to get back on the national level and do very well,” Cyr said. “I think it’s a very good sign that we’re competing with teams that are nationally ranked. Hopefully next year we’ll get that ranking ourselves.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As sophomore wing Wesley Saunders stepped to the free throw line in Salt Lake City with 17 seconds on the clock, the Harvard basketball team was about to pull off its biggest upset in program history.
The 14-seeded Crimson was up four on heavily-favored New Mexico, the three seed, in the second round of the NCAA tournament, and the neutral crowd in EnergySolutions Arena had gradually thrown its support behind Harvard as the game went on.
With familiar shouts of “I believe that we will win” echoing throughout the arena, Saunders sunk two free throws to hand the Crimson its first-ever NCAA tournament victory.
“The reaction when we got back was crazy. It was like nothing I had ever experienced before at Harvard,” co-captain Christian Webster said. “It was like I went to a big time D-I school, and it seemed like everyone cared about basketball. That was something that we wanted to do here, but I didn’t think it would happen that soon. It was just amazing.”
As surprising as the victory was, Harvard’s road to the tournament, through the ups and downs of rebuilding after losing its four top scorers, was even more unexpected.
On opening night at Lavietes Pavilion, the Crimson took the floor with a starting lineup that featured four underclassmen.
Saunders and freshman point guard Siyani Chambers, who ended the season as the Ivy League’s top scoring duo, combined for 20 points in a win over Division III cross-town rival MIT.
Despite its youth, Harvard emerged from non-conference play with a winning record, including two near-upsets at University of Massachusetts and Saint Mary’s. In its second game, the Crimson fell in Amherst when two consecutive threes by the Minutemen tied up the game and then put them ahead with one second on the clock. The wild game started at 10 a.m. as part of ESPN’s Tip-Off Marathon.
Against California, Harvard relied on tenacious perimeter defense to hold the Bears scoreless from deep, and junior co-captain Laurent Rivard’s 19 points led the Crimson to a win. Two days later, Harvard nearly did it again. The Crimson jumped out to a 14-point lead over Saint Mary’s at the end of the first half but let it slip away as time ran out and lost by one.
Harvard also battled with Memphis on the road, coming back from a double-digit deficit to tie the game late in the second half before eventually losing.
The Crimson opened Ivy League play on the road at Dartmouth and pulled out a 10-point victory after a slow first half, but its Ancient Eight home opener against the Big Green at Lavietes would not come so easily.
Harvard found itself down 10 points with 1:33 to play when Webster stepped up to salvage the game, keeping his team’s conference record intact. The senior went three-for-three from deep in the final minutes to force overtime, where the Crimson secured a five-point victory.
Despite a road loss to Columbia, Harvard remained tied for first place in the league when Princeton lost to Yale at home.
The Crimson had defeated every other Ivy League school by the halfway mark, including big wins at home over Penn and Princeton, fueled by sophomore center Kenyatta Smith combining for 34 points and 16 blocks on the weekend.
But Harvard’s reign at the top was short-lived.
The Crimson fell in back-to-back losses on the road in the penultimate weekend of conference play. At Princeton, the two teams were tied with 90 seconds to play, but the Tigers went on a 5-0 run at the free throw line to close out the game. The next day, Harvard was dominated by the Quakers, who held Chambers to five points and stifled a late game rally.
“We give all the credit to Princeton and Penn,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said after the weekend. “They did what they needed to in order to win the basketball game, but we know we can play better and we are confident that, once we get home, we will.”
Going into the last weekend of Ivy League play, Princeton controlled its own destiny. If the Tigers lost one of their three final games on the road, they would likely have squared off with the Crimson in a one-game playoff.
But Princeton fell to both Yale and Brown, and the Crimson won the title outright.
After upsetting UNM, Harvard fell in the third round of the NCAA tournament to Arizona. The Wildcats dominated the Crimson from start to finish, leading by 18 at halftime before extending their lead in the second half. Despite ending its season with what would be a 71-54 blowout, this year’s team goes down as the most successful Crimson squad in history.
“For me, it’s definitely the sweetest one out of the three [Ivy League Championships],” said Webster, the winningest player in Harvard history. “These are my best friends, and for me and Laurent to lead the team to this is unbelievable. I couldn’t ask for anything more.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An offseason marked by adversity turned into a season in which the Harvard baseball team was still in the thick of things for the Ivy League title before dropping its final six games and falling out of contention.
Despite some noteworthy performances on the diamond, it was what happened before the season started that determined the narrative for the Crimson’s 2013 campaign. In July, longtime coach Joe Walsh died, prompting a coaching search that yielded former Trinity boss Bill Decker. Then, in the fall, a number of key contributors left the team, leaving Harvard with just three seniors and a small fraction of its 2012 production returning.
“It was the most interesting year I’ve ever had with a baseball team,” co-captain Robert Wineski said. “We were down a lot of guys, [and] what I took away from it is that there’s not a group of guys who are tougher—better teammates—than the guys in that locker room. When bad things happen, people often quit or don’t give their best, and that never happened here.”
That determination in the face of adversity was on display in the Crimson’s April 7 matchup with Princeton at O’Donnell Field. After dropping the first game of the doubleheader, 13-1, game two featured five lead changes, nine errors, 38 hits, and a three-run bottom of the ninth to give Harvard a 20-19 victory.
“The Princeton game where we won 20-19 in the last inning, that was pretty crazy,” sophomore outfielder Brandon Kregel said. “There were a lot of memorable moments this year, but that [and the April 29 game against Boston College at Fenway Park] definitely stand out the most to me.”
Kregel was part of a sophomore class that was relied upon heavily, particularly on the offensive end. Kregel led the team in batting average (.288), hits (45), home runs (2), RBI (21), and runs (23) en route to being named second team All-Ivy. Joining Kregel on the second team were two of his classmates. Shortstop Mike Martin was second on the team in batting average and hits while second baseman and right-handed pitcher Tanner Anderson was the team’s best option on the mound and a viable bat in the middle of the order.
“We were in a transition year,” Wineski said. “We had a lot of young guys playing and getting valuable experience. Over the next few years, they’re going to get a lot better, and Harvard baseball is going to be a lot better.”
Leading the way during the transition were Decker and his staff, who relied on help from Wineski, co-captain Jordan Haviland and fellow senior Matt Doyle to motivate a young team navigating its way through a series of obstacles that few teams have to deal with in isolation, let alone at the same time.
“They had to take the burden and lead the entire team when we were struck with adversity,” Kregel said of the seniors. “They showed a lot of vocal leadership, and you could really tell they wanted the best for us. It’s hard to let them go after all the support that they’ve given us as a team. We’re going to have to step it up and have some big shoes to fill.”
The Crimson opened its season with a 10-inning, 2-1, victory over Bucknell, giving Harvard its first winning record since 2010. Things went downhill from there, as the team dropped 14 straight before entering conference play with a record of 3-15. After losing both games in its opening Ivy League series against eventual champion Columbia, the Crimson would go on to split its next seven doubleheaders before being swept by Red Rolfe division winner Dartmouth in the final weekend of the regular season. Harvard’s 7-13 conference record was good enough for second in the Rolfe division.
“This year has not quite been a success, but I think it was a lot better than most people anticipated,” Kregel said. “To the team, a success should only be a team that wins the Ivy League championship. That’s what we all should strive for; that’s what success means. We didn’t do that this year, but we put up a good fight and came second in the division. We did fine for what we had, obviously we could have done better, and we will do better next year.”
The Harvard baseball program knows all too well that things can change drastically in one offseason, but entering the summer, optimism abounds on the team.
“We’re leaving the program going in the right direction,” Wineski said. “The coaching staff played a big role in that. I’m so proud to have played with these guys for four years. There’s going be a big turnaround these next few years.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Christine Lin knew that she had the chance to do something special. But as the freshman teed up for the 18th hole of the final round of the Ivy League Championship, she had no idea just how clutch her performance would be.
After trailing leader Kelly Shon by two strokes through 36 holes at Trump National Golf Course in Bedminster, N.J., Lin had tracked down the Princeton junior in the third round as the Crimson and Tigers battled for the team title. Going into the last hole, Lin and Shon knew they were tied for the individual lead, but neither player was exactly sure where her school stood relative to the other in the team competition.
“I actually felt a little bit different,” Lin said of her approach to the 18th. “Physically, I could feel that I was really, really nervous, and I knew it was really important for the team.”
Lin proceeded to match Shon stroke-for-stroke to force a playoff for the individual title. The freshman finished the round with a tournament-best one-under-par 71 and an overall score of two-over-par after sinking a two-foot putt.
The big news, though, would come minutes later after Lin turned in her final scorecard: the Harvard women’s golf team had clinched the team title by a single stroke. The freshman’s breakout performance had allowed the Crimson to edge Princeton by the slimmest of margins, 909-910. Following the tournament, Lin was named Ivy League Rookie of the Year.
“It was just crazy, just one shot out of three days,” Lin said. “If we stand in Princeton’s shoes, they’re probably thinking ‘one putt, that could have made a difference for us.’ You just think of the possibilities of if this hadn’t gone this way, then we wouldn’t have won.”
Lin would end up losing the playoff, but she contributed her best round of golf of the season when her team needed it the most.
“It was so fun and so satisfying to see [Lin] play how she knows that she can play—to be individually at the very top and also help our team come out on top,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads said.
Lin always had the potential to vie for an Ivy title. In high school, the Austin, Texas, resident consistently placed among the top three golfers in her state’s class. But in the season’s first five tournaments, the freshman had not posted a single team-leading final score. She entered the Ivy League Championships in late April with full confidence but few expectations.
“I knew my game was in a good position a few weeks heading into it,” Lin said. “To be honest, I wasn’t thinking that much in terms of score. I talked to my coach, and I realized that putting expectations on this tournament would kind of inhibit me from performing my best.”
At the tournament, Rhoads focused on Lin’s mental game. He turned to a few notes that he had Lin write for him in the summer, and he asked Lin to review the notes before each round.
“[Rhoads] realized that my mental game has prevented me from reaching my potential, and he had me read something that I wrote about myself and [in] what conditions I perform my best,” Lin said. “[The notes] reminded me that I could be really good even if I’m not doing my best.”
Rhoads saw an immediate change in the way Lin approached her game.
“The desire to really be as perfect as [she could] be and really have everything working correctly was almost sort of working against her,” Rhoads added. “[The notes] really opened her up and let her do as well as she could possibly do.”
With a renewed perspective, Lin shot one-over in the first round of the championship to tie for second behind Penn sophomore Amanda Chin. The next day, Lin was among the most consistent of the first-round leaders, shooting two-over in the second round to maintain her second-place position.
“I just believed in doing what I was working on,” Lin said. “I really just enjoyed myself out there and enjoyed the competition and just being with the team.”
With four birdies in the final round, the freshman effectively drove, chipped, and putted Harvard across the country. The win qualified the Crimson to compete at the NCAA West Regionals in Stanford, Calif.
Lin hopes to build on her success next year. She will continue to have plenty of competition on her own team as Harvard returns all five players from its championship roster.
“I definitely have a lot of things to work on,” Lin said. “From now on, the goal is to have a really good attitude, which will help me play even better in future rounds. I want to be one of the top contributors on the team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a positive ending to last year’s campaign, the Harvard men’s golf team entered this season fresh off an offseason of substantial change.
The Crimson lost two key graduating players in Tony Grillo and Mark Pollak, two of Harvard’s best golfers in recent history. The two finished their senior seasons with two of the lowest scoring averages since the 1993 season.
In addition to the loss of Grillo and Pollak, the team introduced new head coach Kevin Rhoads, who had previously exclusively coached the women’s team. The new coach brought a completely different style of coaching to a team with heavy emphasis on the mental game.
“Speaking for myself, having a coach like Kevin helped me a lot,” freshman Rohan Ramnath said. “He’s not only a very good technical coach with our swings, but [regarding] the mental aspect [he] is very positive in making sure we’re in the right place mentally, and that’s probably the hardest part of the game to change.”
The team went through an adjustment period early on in the season as the Crimson adapted to a new coach and the absence of two of its best players. Harvard finished 11th out of 16 at the McLaughlin Invitational and 14th out of 15 at the Windon Memorial tournament to begin its season in early September, two of the Crimson’s worst performances of the year. Harvard would rebound with a strong fifth-place finish at the McDonald Cup to finish the month of September and set the stage for the rest of the season.
Harvard continually faced similar ups and downs throughout the course of the year. Individual players showed flashes of brilliance that put them in contention in tournaments throughout the fall and spring, but the team was plagued with inconsistency and injury that hurt their final results.
Junior Seiji Liu finished second at the McDonald Cup in the fall, and junior captain Theo Lederhausen finished seventh at the Princeton Invitational in the spring. The team’s fifth and sixth place finishes at those two tournaments were Harvard’s best results of the year.
Despite these promising finishes, however, players were unable to carry strong performances throughout the length of the calendar year. Brown ousted the Crimson in the first round of fall Ivy League match play. Liu suffered a wrist injury shortly thereafter that would sideline him for the entirety of the spring season, and Ramnath struggled throughout the fall with a back injury. Rhoads said that, despite the injuries, the team demonstrated progress throughout the year.
“It was an extremely helpful year,” Rhoads said. “Players learned a lot of what I asked of them. I think that showed in spurts throughout the year. We had a number of really good rounds where we did everything that we’re trying to, but putting it all together for all two or three rounds is something we’re going to have to do better.”
The team can take comfort in the fact that freshmen Ramnath and Un Cho showed a lot of promise and steadily improved their games and results over the course of the season.
“Both freshman had a tough time in the fall,” Lederhausen said. “Rohan had a back injury so he couldn’t really play in the fall. Over the winter, they both worked incredibly hard, and it paid off well for both of them; they both played really well in the spring.”
The team finished sixth of eight teams at the Ivy League Invitational—two spots lower than last year—to finish the spring season, with the freshman duo leading the team throughout the weekend.
Cho sat in fourth place on the last day despite a fever. A lukewarm last day of play left him in twelfth, but he still finished with the best score among the Crimson. Ramnath finished second among Harvard players in 21st place.
The results bode well for the team’s future, especially considering that the team is bringing back its entire roster for next year’s season.
“I think the upcoming seniors are going to do really well,” Rhoads said. “They’ve been through a lot and have shown a lot of leadership, and if they set the right example, then it’s going to be really good for the rest of our team. The guys have been working super hard, the work ethic has been off the charts, and I really believe that this is going to pay off next year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though this past year marked the eighth straight losing season for Harvard’s field hockey team, coach Tjerk van Herwaarden used his first year with the Crimson to institute a new system and change the program’s direction.
Van Herwaarden began his tenure as coach with a 1-0 win in Harvard’s season-opener against Holy Cross. The success would not continue however, as the Crimson only earned two more victories on the season to finish with a 3-13 record.
“We may not have had the year numerically that we would have liked,” co-captain midfielder Kim Goh said. “We obviously would have liked to have had a few more wins in there, but I think in terms of progress we are very satisfied with our improvement over the course of the season.”
Of Harvard’s 13 losses on the season, three came in overtime. In fact, the very next game after the Crimson’s success in the season opener was a 2-1 loss to Sacred Heart in double-overtime.
With six minutes left in the game at Jordan Field, Harvard held a 1-0 lead over the Pioneers. But the Crimson failed to hang onto the lead as Sacred Heart senior Lindsey Katsen was able to score and force overtime. Harvard did not record a shot on goal in the extra period before Pioneer freshman Liz Bergman was able to end the game off of a penalty corner.
The overtime loss in the second game of the season started a string of losses for the Crimson as players adjusted to van Herwaarden’s style of play.
“I thought transitioning with a new coach was difficult at first, but at the end of the year I can tell that we improved a lot,” freshman midfielder Madison Jung said. “The hardest thing this season was just adjusting to a new system. That kind of thing is always a process, and it just took us awhile to figure everything out.”
Harvard’s first Ivy League game against Yale on Sept. 15 also needed an overtime period to decide the victor. A goal late in the second half by Crimson sophomore forward Noel Painter tied the game, 1-1, and forced overtime.
But Bulldog senior Mary Beth Barham’s second goal of the game in the 82nd minute gave Yale the 2-1 win.
“Something we have struggled with in the past is maintaining our mental composure as the season wears on,” Goh said. “I think Coach [van Herwaarden] did a great job at teaching us how to keep focused even near the end of the season and helped us keep a competitive mindset.”
The late season composure showed for the Crimson as it picked up its only Ivy League win of the season Sept. 29 against Brown in Providence. Harvard defeated the Bears, 1-0, behind strong play from co-captain goalie Cynthia Tassopoulos, who recorded seven saves on the afternoon. The win at Brown was the fifth shutout in the senior’s collegiate career.
Tassopoulos finished her senior season with 106 saves through 14 games, giving her a total of 576 in her Harvard career. Tassopoulos is one of five seniors the Crimson will be losing to graduation. Forwards Emma Keller and Katelin Wahl and midfielders Goh and Molly Stansik will also be leaving.
The players were not the only ones having to adjust to a new culture during van Herwaarden’s first season. Van Herwaarden, coming from a national championship caliber program in Maryland, had to adjust to coaching at Harvard.
“[Coach van Herwaarden] is great,” Goh said. “He came from a program that had been really competitive so it has been a big change for him as well as us. He had to adapt to the fact that this was an Ivy League academic and athletic environment and we were learning how to take our competitiveness and expectations to a new level.”
In Goh, the Crimson will be losing an All-Ivy second team defender who has started all 67 possible games in her Harvard career.
While Harvard may be losing two defensive stalwarts in co-captains Goh and Tassopoulos, it will return its leading scorer in Painter. Painter and the rest of the returning Crimson squad will be joined by six incoming freshman as van Herwaarden tries to build upon his first season in Cambridge.
“I think his influence really showed in the amount of people going out and practicing on their own to get better and putting in extra time,” Goh said. “He really changed the level of expectation for the program.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Both the Harvard heavyweight and lightweight crews dominated the spring dual season, posting undefeated records against their competitors.
At Eastern Sprints in mid-May, the crews showed their merit, sweeping the first varsity events and granting the first varsity eight boats spots at the historic Henley Royal Regatta.
However, despite the Crimson’s success so far, the most challenging and meaningful competition of the season still lies ahead at IRA Nationals that begin on Friday.
HEAVYWEIGHTS
The Harvard heavyweights began their dual season by racing Cornell at home on the Charles River.  The Crimson posted a solid result by taking three of four races from the Big Red.
Harvard’s fiercest competition came in the following two regattas, where they faced Ivy League competitors Brown and Princeton. Although the Crimson won three of its five races against the Bears, both the first and second varsity races were very closely contested. While the first varsity race for the Stein Cup fell in Harvard’s favor, the margin of victory was just over a second.
The Crimson’s April 20 race against Princeton and MIT was postponed by one day due to the Boston Marathon bombing, MIT shooting, and resulting lockdown in the area. The Engineers were unable to travel to attend the rescheduled race in Princeton, N.J., so Harvard faced the Tigers alone. The uncertainty surrounding the Crimson’s race against Princeton added another difficult obstacle to the competition that the Crimson faced from its scheduled foes.
“I think mentally the guys were in a really good place,” said senior Justin Mundt, following the Princeton race on April 21. “We had to wait 24 hours, but our heads were all in the right place. We were up and ready to race.”
While Harvard’s first varsity boat defeated the Tigers by a considerable margin of about three seconds, the Crimson second varsity boat was overtaken for the first time all season.
“It was a very strong crew from Princeton, so credit to them for rowing a good race,” Mundt said. “We didn’t get the rhythm we hoped to, but it was a solid row.”
On April 27, Harvard won three races against Penn and Navy to capture the Adams Cup for the 14th straight year.  The following weekend, the Crimson swept Northeastern in four races and collected its 16th straight Smith Cup with a win in the first varsity race.
The Harvard heavyweights face remaining contests at IRA National Championships on May 31 and at the 148th annual Harvard-Yale Regatta on June 9.
LIGHTWEIGHTS
The No. 1 Harvard lightweights had a strong start to their dual season with a decisive win over Delaware at home on the Charles River. The Crimson took three of five races from the Blue Hens and outpaced them in the first varsity race by a margin of 16.5 seconds.
“I think it was one of the best first races of the season we’ve had, at least in my time at Harvard,” senior Austin Meyer said.
Harvard continued its positive momentum into the following weekend, when the Crimson faced a double-header of two separate regattas in the two-day span. The Crimson first traveled to Philadelphia and took three of five races against Cornell and Penn. Then Harvard traveled to Princeton, where it swept Georgetown in four races.
“Our league is still competitive because everyone is the same size,” captain Erich Schultze said. “Any time you win a race, you can’t take that for granted.  Winning races is what we set out to do at the end of the year, and anytime you can get a win, it’s a good weekend.”
On April 13, the Crimson once again took all four races against Dartmouth, and the first varsity extended its undefeated streak to recapture the Biglin Bowl. The following weekend, Harvard dominated Navy in three of four races in what was the first sporting event in the Boston area following the lockdown.
The Crimson then competed in its most challenging and historic race of the spring season: the Harvard-Yale-Princeton Regatta.  The Crimson won the first varsity race for the fourth straight year and recorded wins in three of the four remaining contests.
“I definitely think that this crew has the focus and the potential to be the best crew in Harvard lightweight history,” Meyer said following the Delaware season opener.
With its dominant record so far, the Crimson has lived up to its potential and No. 1 ranking.  The Harvard lightweights will still face tough competition at IRA National Championships on May 31.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In his very first Harvard baseball game his freshman year, outfielder Brandon Kregel suffered a wrist injury that ended up sidelining him for the rest of the season. Kregel’s stat line on the year: four at-bats and one hit.
The outfielder’s sophomore campaign could not have been more different. Kregel led the Crimson with a .288 batting average, posted a team-high 45 hits, including 17 for extra bases, and belted two home runs.
After only appearing in one game his freshman year, Kregel took the field for each of Harvard’s 41 contests this past season.
“I’m just happy that I can play again and get back into the swing of things,” Kregel said. “I’m really happy for that opportunity, and that’s what’s really driving me to be the best I can be going forward.”
Kregel’s wrist had bothered him in the weeks leading up to the first game of the 2012 campaign. When power hitters like Kregel swing the bat, they generate a large amount of torque, much of which is transferred into their wrists.
Constant wear and tear from swinging everyday weakened the area, Kregel said. He decided to give it a go in the first game of the year, and he started in right field and even smacked a home run in his third at-bat.
But in his next plate appearance, Kregel swung at a high fastball and broke a bone in his wrist while simultaneously damaging numerous tendons.
“Nobody really knew what happened, other than that I couldn’t swing or move my hand at all,” Kregel said. “But it ended up sidelining me all season, which was pretty devastating for me. It was pretty humbling as well. I mean, I’ve never been injured like that before, and it just shows that everything can be lost in a second, and it just makes me appreciate the game so much more.”
The recovery process extended from the end of that first game into the offseason, and the wrist healed quickly enough for Kregel to take some swings in the winter. He started his sophomore season in the same place as his last.
According to Kregel, although his wrist seemed to be at full physical strength, he needed more time to confidently swing like his old self and not approach the point of contact with shreds of doubt in his mind.
“It’s more probably a mental thing,” Kregel said. “I just didn’t want to re-injure it or do anything that would sideline me for the entire season. That would have been devastating…. As a result, I was still trying to find my swing, and it took awhile to get back into the rhythm of things and finally trust it so that I could swing normally and not have to worry about it breaking again.”
But Kregel quickly grew past his mental reservations and became the team’s top offensive contributor this spring. The outfielder hit consistently throughout the season, and he was named second-team All-Ivy.
Kregel’s contributions were not limited to the offensive end, as he emerged as a leader on a very young team with only three seniors.
“Brandon worked really hard in the offseason,” co-captain Robert Wineski said. “He told me that he really wanted to lead by example this year, and I think he really went out and proved a lot of people wrong when he came back and was the same player he was beforehand.”
Kregel became the centerpiece of Harvard’s lineup this season, consistently batting in the number three spot. The Lilburn, Ga., native came up big a number of times for the Crimson and led the team with 21 RBIs.
“When Brandon comes up with guys on base, you expect him to get that hit to knock guys in, and he did most of the time,” Wineski said. “He gave us a stability in our lineup that we needed…. When you see Brandon up there, you really think something good is going to happen.”
Despite improving leaps and bounds production-wise from his freshman year, Kregel still feels that he has much to work on. By putting the wrist injury behind him, Kregel can continue to work in the offseason and come back as a strong junior presence on next year’s Crimson squad.
“Relatively, I guess it was a pretty successful season,” Kregel said. “But at the same time I still have a lot of work to do, and I still have to improve in a lot of aspects…. It’s definitely still not where I need to be or where anybody else on our team needs to be, for that matter.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s squash team entered its 2012-13 campaign with the pressure of living up to last year’s success. The Crimson had wrapped up the previous season with a win at the CSA National Championships, capping a spotless 17-0 record. Later in the season, then-freshman Amanda Sobhy secured her first collegiate national title.
“We entered the season with a target on our backs,” co-captain Natasha Kingshott said. “We knew that we had to work even harder to repeat the success we had in the previous season.”
The hard work paid off. Harvard captured its second straight Howe Cup with a 5-4 win over Trinity at the 2013 CSA National Championships, and Sobhy similarly defended her individual title. But the season was not without a bump or two along the road.
“I think it really is a testament to our team, our strength, and our determination that this season was probably the most difficult that we’ve had in recent years in that we had that loss to Princeton, which was quite a shock,” Kingshott said. “I think the way that we reacted to that loss and came back even stronger made the final victory at nationals that much more meaningful.”
After starting out undefeated in its first six matches of the year, the Crimson suffered its first loss in almost two years, dropping a 5-4 decision to the Tigers. It was a rare slip-up for a team accustomed to perfection.
“We always worked hard, but something like that [loss] makes us come together even more,” Kingshott said. “It makes us work harder as individuals but also makes us work harder as a unit. We’re not only playing for ourselves, but we’re playing for the 15 other girls on the roster.”
Harvard quickly recovered from what could have been a devastating blow to the season, sweeping its next four matches with 9-0 victories and carrying a seven-game win streak into the national championships.
“Even though we lost a match during the season, we bounced back from it really well,” Sobhy said. “We played really well in the national championship. I’m just so proud of everyone coming out [at nationals] and giving it their all.”
Harvard’s championship run started out smoothly with a 9-0 win over Stanford in the quarterfinal match. A 6-3 win over Penn sealed a berth in the finals against Trinity, who had upset top-seeded Princeton to earn its shot at a national title.
It was a back-and-forth contest in the finals, as Harvard quickly gained an edge over the Bantams in the first rotation, but Trinity stormed back to close the gap through six matches.
In the end, sophomore Amanda Sobhy clinched the title for the Crimson with an 11-8, 11-7, 11-8 victory over Kanzy El Defrawy, who had earned a rare game win against Sobhy earlier in the season to hand the sophomore her first ever collegiate game loss.
“[The loss] definitely gave me motivation to show people that losing a game was not really supposed to happen,” Sobhy said. “It was great for Kanzy to get a game, and she’s a really great player.”
With the win, Sobhy secured the national title for Harvard, its third championship in the past four years.
“It’s almost like a dream,” Kingshott said. “You couldn’t have written a better ending. I know all the seniors are so proud to have been a part of something so special, for not only the last two years, but [when] we won our freshman year as well. It was surreal.”
Sobhy continued the Crimson repeat streak, as the sophomore clinched her second individual national title in as many years. Also joining Sobhy at the CSA Individual National Championships, freshman Michelle Gemmell won the first-round consolation, and sophomore Haley Mendez reached the finals of the second-round consolation.
The individual and team titles capped another standout season for Harvard, which, despite the loss to Princeton, secured its place atop the collegiate squash order.
“I think the way that we reacted to that loss [at Princeton] and came back even stronger made the final victory at nationals that much more meaningful,” Kingshott said. “When you work so hard and you do have such a heartbreaking low at one point, to finish so strong is just so gratifying.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In EIVA volleyball, the conference championship has become something of a foregone conclusion. Penn State has taken 15 straight EIVA titles and is one of the few teams east of the Rocky Mountains to challenge consistently for a national championship. While the rest of the EIVA certainly is not a David, the Nittany Lions are a Goliath.
So when Penn State arrived in Cambridge with a 51-game conference win streak stretching back to its 2008 national championship season, few observers expected the Crimson, an emerging force in the EIVA, to challenge the Nittany Lions’ hegemony. But behind strong service and passing, Harvard was able to strike early and often for one of the biggest upsets in EIVA history, 3-0.
Sophomore outside hitter DJ White returned from injury to register a game-high 13 kills as the home team put Penn State on its heels early and continued to apply pressure.
Junior co-captain Nick Madden attributes much of the victory to both White’s and the home crowd’s presence. Throughout the season, the MAC proved challenging for visitors, with the Crimson falling only once in Cambridge.
“They’re used to their 2000 fans at their school, but when they would get a kill, it was silent,” Madden said. “When we would do something, even if it wasn’t a great play, we would have all of our buddies and parents there cheering. Fan support was huge in that game.”
When the configuration of the EIVA changed in 2011, setting up two regular season meetings between the Crimson and the Nittany Lions, co-captain Rob Lothman was not positive he would ever see Harvard challenge the squad.
“I think we laughed a bit realizing that Penn State was going to have to come to the MAC and climb all of our stairs to the smaller gym with a smaller crowd,” the senior said.
But as the 2012 season saw the Crimson jump from a 9-13 team to an 18-6 team, including a tough five-set loss to Penn State in which Harvard led, 2-0, belief began to infect the team. And after another five-set loss on Jan. 26, the Crimson knew it was on the brink.
For Lothman, the game will always be one of the defining moments of his Harvard career.
“I’m going to remember that game forever,” the co-captain said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ten minutes to tipoff: New Mexico and Harvard players begin layup lines. Fourteenth-seeded Harvard boasts no starter taller than 6’7”; third-seeded New Mexico starts four players that size.
Harvard entered its second-round NCAA tournament game against New Mexico as an 11-point underdog. The number two team in the country according to the Ratings Percentage Index, New Mexico was a popular pick to emerge from a weak West Region while Harvard’s squad was characterized more by what had happened off the court—the Government 1310 cheating scandal—than on it.
“Last year, we were expected to be in this position,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said before the game. “We were predicted to be the best team in our conference.… This year we had a different set of circumstances.”
17:57 left in the first half: After sophomore center Kenyatta Smith pulls down a rebound, freshman point guard Siyani Chambers takes the outlet pass and darts up the floor. He lays it up off the backboard amidst a swarm of Lobo defenders for the first points of the game. Harvard didn’t lose the lead the rest of the half.
Although only its second time on college basketball’s biggest stage, Harvard played like the more experienced team early on. New Mexico missed 11 of its first 12 attempts, including four straight missed threes, as the Crimson opened the game on a 9-2 run.
“They struggled with making their shots, and I’m sure they were incredibly frustrated with that,” Amaker said after the game. “But I like to think the way we locked in defensively…had something to do with it as well.”
At the center of it were Chambers and Smith, two players whose contributions had buoyed the Crimson entering the tournament. Chambers played nearly 38 minutes per game and facilitated the Harvard offense while Smith burst onto the scene late in the year, providing the Crimson with a defensive stalwart down low.
18:46 left in the second half: New Mexico junior combo guard Tony Snell—a probable NBA draft pick—sprints down the court and rises above smaller Harvard defenders to lay the ball in off the backboard to give the Lobos a one-point lead. New Mexico is on an 11-2 run and Snell has seven points after being held in check for the first half.
The Crimson’s season featured high peaks, but also deep lows. The team returned only one starter from last season and suffered several late-game heartbreaks in the non-conference schedule.
Harvard ran out to a 7-1 start in the Ivy League season entering the weekend trip to Princeton and Penn. A pair of losses to the Killer P’s dropped Harvard a half-game behind Princeton with three to play. After losing to Penn, the Crimson no longer controlled its own destiny.
“We weren’t perfect,” Amaker said before the UNM game. “We had our moments [this season] where we were in the depths of despair.”
But, like it had all season, Harvard bounced back. Victories over Cornell and Columbia, combined with two Princeton losses, in the season’s last weekend propelled Harvard to the NCAA tournament.
18:35 left in the second half: Running off a pick, co-captain Christian Webster takes a pass from Chambers, squares up to the hoop, and sinks a three to give the Crimson the lead. On the next possession, Rivard sinks a corner three. Harvard is up four.
The three was the great equalizer for Harvard, who started four guards most of the season. The team shot 39.8 percent from behind the arc, good for seventh in the nation. A rotating cast of hot shooters, led by Rivard and Webster—who took 85.4 percent of their shots from beyond the arc—compensated for struggles on the defensive end. Against the Lobos, the team shot 54.2 percent overall and sunk eight threes—five by Rivard.
2:18 left in the second half: With the Lobos down six, Snell misses a three from the corner. Kirk misses a put-back. Smith corrals the rebound and Amaker calls timeout. Out of the timeout, Chambers uses a screen from Smith and rolls to his left. Seeing that both Lobo defenders had dropped back, Chambers steps to the free throw line and lets loose a jumper. Nothing but net.
When the clock struck zero, the Crimson emerged victorious, 68-62, in the school’s first ever NCAA tournament victory. Despite 22 points and 12 rebounds from Kirk, Harvard had largely overcome a significant size disadvantage as the figurative and literal underdog. Williams and Snell combined to shoot five-for-18 from the field; sophomore Wesley Saunders outscored them, 18-17, on his own.
For a team that overcame adversity throughout the season, first in the form of departed seniors Curry and Casey and later in the form of Ian Hummer and the Princeton Tigers, sitting at the podium afterwards, Amaker summed up the win succinctly.
“This means the world to us,” Amaker said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Gary Power could have folded.
The cards were stacked against the junior as he entered the third game of his national semifinal match. No. 1 Princeton had not lost to an Ivy opponent in two years. His defending national champion teammate had taken an unexpected loss. Worst of all, he was down 0-2.
“We figured we were done,” junior Brandon McLaughlin said. “We figured it was over.”
But Power, playing at the No. 4 spot, proceeded to rattle off three straight 11-7 games over Tigers junior Dylan Ward, propelling the Harvard men’s squash team to an Ivy League title and its first Potter Cup final since 2005.
“I’ve only been here three seasons, but that was the biggest moment I’ve ever seen,” Crimson coach Mike Way said a day after the semifinal. “For [Power] to come out and do what he did was absolutely heroic.”
In the final, Harvard fell to No. 2 Trinity, 6-3. While the team came up just short this year, the program inched closer to its 31st national title with its best finish since last winning it all in 1998.
“At the time, [the loss at nationals] was tough,” McLaughlin said. “But reflecting on the season, I think we can all pretty much be proud of how we performed.”
Harvard did not drop a single game in seven of its first eight matches to open its season on a tear. 5-4 edgings at the hands of Princeton and Trinity were the Crimson’s only regular season losses.
At the CSA national tournament in New Haven, Conn., Harvard reached the semifinals with a 6-3 win over Rochester. In the semifinals, Power opened his match on cruise control with the Crimson up 4-2 and undefeated junior Ali Farag on the court. But when the Tigers drew even off of Farag’s first career collegiate loss, Power buckled down.
In the national championship the next day, the Crimson nearly sealed the deal. Harvard entered the match as the underdog but came closer to a title than it ever had in the last 15 years, with key wins from Farag, junior Nigel Koh, and senior Alexander Ma.
“On the day, we actually had a shot at winning,” McLaughlin said. “I think Trinity was just a stronger team this year. Next year, I think it will be a different story.”
As the defending individual national champion, Farag was almost automatic for the Crimson at the No. 1 position. The junior just missed replicating his undefeated sophomore season, winning a team-high 16 individual matches but dropping two.
Farag’s second loss came in the individual national semifinal as his repeat bid ended in a tight 3-2 loss to eventual champion Amr Khalifa of St. Lawrence. At the end of the season, Farag shared Ivy League Co-Player of the Year honors with Princeton senior Todd Harrity, who also clipped the Harvard junior in five games in the team semifinal.
“He’s an unbelievable player; he’s just a really great talent,” McLaughlin said of Farag. “I expect him to come back with more hunger next year and can definitely see him winning individual nationals.”
In addition to Farag, McLaughlin captured CSA All-American honors. The junior was named to the second team after finishing 13-3 at the No. 2 position.
“I had a lot better season this year than last year playing at the same position,” McLaughlin said. “There’s always room to improve, and next year I’m going to try to go undefeated if I can.”
Power and junior Tommy Mullaney represented the Crimson in the individual national tournament alongside Farag and McLaughlin. Power finished 13-5 from the No. 2, 3, and 4 positions while Mullaney went 7-5 at the No. 6 position on the year.
While the Crimson graduates captains Jason Michas (No. 8, 10-1) and Zeke Scherl (No. 7, 10-5), Harvard will have no shortage of experienced leadership next year with six rising seniors in its top nine. The Crimson will also welcome an influx of talent from a rising freshman class that includes the brothers of McLaughlin and Koh. The challenge will be to unseat champion Trinity, which has won all but one Potter Cup since Harvard’s 1998 win.
“There’s going to be a lot of experience, and we’re really talented,” McLaughlin said. “We’re excited about our prospects for winning nationals next year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In one of the most entertaining, high-scoring, and flat-out bizarre games of the baseball season, Harvard prevailed, 20-19, against Princeton on April 7 at O’Donnell Field.
Down two runs entering the bottom of the ninth, Harvard scored three times in the final frame to walk off for the win. All three runs came on wild pitches.
The two squads combined for 38 hits and nine errors. Each team belted a grand slam, and five Crimson batters registered at least three base hits.
Winds gusted at speeds of up to 40 miles per hour out to center field throughout the game, wreaking havoc for fielders and ensuring a game filled with plenty of runs.
“If anybody hit it in the air, people would misjudge it because of the wind, and it would fall in somewhere,” sophomore outfielder Brandon Kregel said. “And a routine pop-up might fly out of the yard just because of the wind. That was really interesting because a four-run lead meant really nothing in that game because it was really easy to score runs.”
Although Princeton jumped out to a 7-2 lead, Harvard answered with 14 runs in three innings to seize what appeared to be a comfortable 17-10 lead.
But the Tigers scored five in the seventh and four in the ninth to regain the advantage and set up the dramatic bottom of the ninth.
“It’s the first year that I’ve been here that the team never quit in that [type of] game,” co-captain Robert Wineski said. “Every ball that was hit in the air, I was like, ‘Okay, that ball’s gone.’ We go up by [seven]; we knew that the game wasn’t over yet because the ball was just flying out of the park. Of course, then they go up in the last inning, and in my mind, the game’s over, but with this group of guys, you never know.”
The game represented Harvard’s second walk-off win of the season. By the end of nine innings, the scoreboard resembled that of a football game.
“That game was really, really funny,” Kregel said. “I felt bad for the pitchers on both teams because their ERAs probably skyrocketed after that game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For some athletes, it is been a lifelong dream. For others, it is an opportunity to explore the world. But for all student-athletes who try to go pro, breaking into the professional ranks is a chance to prove themselves on the next level and receive financial compensation for doing so.
Professional sports is not a field most people associate with a Harvard education, but for a select few Crimson student-athletes, four years of intercollegiate competition is not enough. From shooting hoops in Europe to calling plays in the NFL, several Harvard graduates are making waves on professional playing fields around the world.
“People just don’t expect Harvard students to be quality athletes,” said Rachel Brown ’12, who won a national softball championship in Sweden this past year after leading the Crimson to two Ivy League titles. “Anytime somebody [coming from Harvard] is successful with an athletic career, it’s kind of a big deal.”
UNEQUAL OPPORTUNITY
While graduating athletes with professional aspirations have the same immediate goal of signing a contract, a sports career is a means to a variety of ends.
Former basketball co-captain Miriam Rutzen will play in Europe over the summer and hopes to continue doing so in the fall.  For the senior, an overseas job is just another phase of her life, not a permanent career.
“[I want to] use basketball to move on and explore the world where I’m learning about a new culture, a different people, a different language,” Rutzen said. “A Harvard education often times pushes you to kick away your beliefs and kick away what you think and how you are [as a person].... My goal isn’t to play professionally. It’s to use that to take me to the next step [in my life].”
Brown,  the winningest pitcher in Harvard history and now the assistant softball coach at Stony Brook, believes the disparity in attention garnered by men’s and women’s professional teams means a career in sports is not necessarily the endgame for the bulk of female student-athletes.
“It was more just a temporary life experience to go play softball in Sweden,” Brown said. “For women, it’s not as possible for athletics to be a professional career as it is for men, especially with softball and baseball.”
FOLLOWING THEIR FOOTSTEPS
The difference in opportunities—and with them, challenges—yields different goals for male student-athletes from Harvard looking to enter the highest level of competition.
This April, the Baltimore Ravens selected senior Kyle Juszczyk in the fourth round of the NFL draft. Juszczyk, who utilized his versatility as an H-back in the Crimson’s offense, was Harvard’s first NFL draft pick since quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05.
Fitzpatrick’s nine-year career exemplifies the possibility of post-Crimson success. After a college career that included an Ivy League Offensive Player of the Year award in 2004, nearly 7,000 total offensive yards, and an almost-perfect Wonderlic test, the quarterback was drafted by the St. Louis Rams in 2005.
“It was a dream, something I had always wanted to do since I had been growing up, but I didn’t think it was ever going to be any sort of reality,” Fitzpatrick said. “I talked to [Harvard] coach [Tim] Murphy...and apparently I had shown up on the radar of some NFL teams. It wasn’t until after my junior year and heading into my senior year that I had any idea that it was a possibility for me.”
Fitzpatrick—who chose Harvard after unsuccessfully pursuing a Football Bowl Subdivision scholarship—says his time in Cambridge colored his worldview and informed him of the variety of people and cultures lying ahead in his life.
“At Harvard, I grew up a lot in terms of being able to deal with different types of people because where I grew up in Arizona, it’s predominately white and predominantly Mormon families, so there’s not a whole lot of diversity,” Fitzpatrick said. “Coming to Harvard was an eye-opening experience because there’s so much diversity on campus.”
The quarterback would go on to be traded to the Cincinnati Bengals and eventually sign a six-year, $59 million contract, with $24 million guaranteed, with the Buffalo Bills in 2011 before moving to the Tennessee Titans this offseason.
COMBATING STEREOTYPES
Fitzpatrick’s career is exceptional considering the relative dearth of successful Ivy League players replicating that success in the NFL. Recent standouts, such as Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year Josue Ortiz ’11-’12 and quarterback Collier Winters ’12, failed to secure contracts and senior running back Treavor Scales has experienced similar struggles.
For players like Ortiz and Scales, who both received invitations to franchise minicamps, the Crimson shield presents an initial challenge because of the perceptions that people carry with the brand.
“Guys don’t expect Harvard football players to be ballplayers,” Scales said. “They expect this cerebral guy, this guy that will get a 50 on the Wonderlic, the guy that’ll impress you in the film room. But when he gets out there, does he have the fight that this guy from Alabama [or] LSU has? Does he have the grit that a guy at UGA has? And proving that I am a tough son-of-a-gun with a chip on my shoulder, that’s where I find the most trouble in going to minicamps.”
But Scales also notes that after receiving the initial invitation to camps, the stigma of the H disappears and landing a roster spot is purely based on the talent level of a given player.
“I’ve learned that a lot of it has to do with the logo on the helmet, but I’ve talked to scouts that will tell you straight up that the best players will play in their organization—it’s not a matter of where you came from,” Scales said. “It might get your foot in the door, but it doesn’t mean you’re going to stay there.”
TAKING THEIR SHOT
In addition to the connotations of the Harvard brand, college scheduling presents an obstacle for student-athletes attempting to impress scouts.  Alex Killorn ’12 was drafted by the Tampa Bay Lightning after high school but notes that his choice to play in college rather than enter the NHL system immediately discouraged some teams from taking a closer look.
The disadvantage for college-bound hockey players with professional hopes stems from the increasing number of high schoolers who forgo college entirely and instead play in the junior leagues, which have a pro-style schedule, before entering the NHL.
“Going through the process, a lot of teams told me, ‘If you go to Harvard, we probably won’t draft you,’ just because they didn’t feel like that was the best thing for my development,” Killorn said. “For a guy like me to come through and transition well through the pro ranks might have helped Tampa be like ‘This is a great program and kids can develop here into good players.’”
BUILT-IN BARRIERS TO ENTRY
Despite the success and reputation of Harvard hockey, the Ivy League’s restrictive scheduling gives other college players a competitive edge.
“You play a shorter season than everyone else...just because you play in the Ivy League, so you don’t get as much development in that sense. You don’t play as many games,” Killorn said.
Scheduling presents a similar challenge off the ice. Although the recent success of the Harvard basketball program has aided the Crimson’s ability to draw high profile non-conference opponents, the professional realm has still been a challenge for hoopsters to conquer.
“Professionally, I think coming from Harvard does put you back,” said former co-captain Keith Wright ’12. “I think [Houston Rockets guard] Jeremy Lin [’10] opened the door a little bit.... I was talking to different teams, and one of the main things they brought up was that you’re not playing the top competition coming from the Ivy League.”
Wright, the 2010-11 Ivy League Player of the Year, went undrafted in the 2012 NBA Draft and took his low-post game to Sweden, where he shot nearly 60 percent from the field for Uppsala Basket this past year.
While Wright has enjoyed success with the prominent club team, he is ready to pursue his childhood dream. Now back in the U.S., Wright plans to make another run at the big leagues, just as many undrafted athletes have done before.
“Me not making it in was based solely on them wanting to see professional success and professional experience,” Wright says. “I had to go out and prove myself.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I was using shimmery gold duct tape to hang the senior events calendar on my wall when I almost tripped over Craig, the 60-cubic-foot inflatable blue whale my roommate mysteriously brought home one night.
After kicking him in the tail to move him out of my way, I realized the absurdity of the extra large blow-up animal living on the floor of my common room for the better part of two months. Admittedly, owning Craig for so long is a little strange. But at the same time, it makes sense in the ridiculous narrative my roommates and I have created over the last few years.
Craig fits into our weird shared history: from his original adoption to his widely lauded appearance at another roommate’s final home water polo game, not to mention the fact that it took an entire episode of The Amazing Race to blow him up.
And as I look around my common room, I realize Craig isn’t the only piece of strangeness we’ve latched on to. As the year has progressed, the white space of our room has grown smaller and smaller as a sometimes disturbing, always memorable hodgepodge of stuff has taken over our walls.
Is it even okay to have a tacky, bedazzled, six-foot-long “You Look Gorgeous” sign on the wall right when you walk in the door? Or an enlarged laminated photo of men’s basketball player Keith Wright’s head (also duct taped) posted next to the window? What about the white board tallying beer pong victories? Or the blown-up image of the four of us looking like fools at our last 21st birthday?
The answer is that it’s more than okay—it’s encouraged. Every single decoration in my common room tells a unique story that creates a timeline of what has happened over the past two semesters.  The weirdness of each individual item—and especially of the conglomeration of the entire room—is something that should be celebrated.
If anything, the stories behind the eclectic accumulation of the stuff in my common room—from the pin-the-nose-on-the-pumpkin still on our wall from Halloween to the name tag permanently ingrained on our floor since our HBO-themed party—has only made my Harvard experience more memorable and special.
What’s even more meaningful is that I’ve realized the entire random, outlandish plethora of accumulated room adornment is just like the sports board at The Crimson.
Individually, we seem like we should each be our own entity. We have people who write in hopes of turning it into a career and people who do it just as a hobby; we have varsity athletes and people who still push with two hands when shooting a basketball.
We have extremely varied majors, campus houses, and social scenes. I am confident that I would not have met two-thirds of the members of the sports board—let alone be so close to so many of them—had I not joined it myself.
But when we all come together, we create something. Despite being from all sorts of backgrounds and having a wide range of personalities, we band together because we share the same unifying interests.
And just as I would never change the absurd décor in my room, I would never want to alter the makeup of the sports board. It’s not just a bunch of stereotypical nerds or jocks or anything in between; it’s a family of individual people who have come together to produce some phenomenal content over the years.
Even if post-college life looks down upon using metallic duct tape as a wall decoration or having a larger-than-life-sized head of a college basketball player hanging next to the window, the celebration of individualism and weirdness that those things represent—like the sports board does—is something that I hope to hold on to forever.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Eighty-three seconds into the overtime period, junior forward Elizabeth Weisman collected the ball from the scrum off of a corner kick and shot it past the Brown goalkeeper to give the Harvard women’s soccer team a 1-0 victory and coach Ray Leone his 250th career win.
“Ray was really excited to get the win,” sophomore midfielder Meg Casscells-Hamby said. “He doesn’t care a lot about his personal accomplishments, which just says a lot about him, but we were all really excited about it as a team, and he deserves it—he’s a great coach.”
But the win, which came in the first nonconference game versus an Ivy opponent in program history, was too little, too late with two matches remaining in the season. The Crimson’s championship hopes had already ended in its previous contest, a 3-1 loss to Princeton in which the Tigers tallied three goals in the final 30 minutes.
“We knew after that game that we couldn’t really advance in our season in the Ivy League, but we just kept on going and we just know that after every loss, you have to learn,” Casscells-Hamby said. “We learned a lot from that loss about problems in our midfield and our defense, but I think we did bounce back pretty well, and we got some good wins after. We’ll learn from it for next season—it was a tough loss, but I think it’ll help us moving forward.”
The Crimson, which went 3-3-1 in Ancient Eight play and 9-5-3 overall, had a strong start, dropping just one game in the first five to kick off the season. But the team then went nearly three weeks without a win, during which Harvard lost its first conference match, 1-0, to Penn.
Only able to put up one shot on goal against Penn, the Crimson lost in heartbreaking fashion as the Quakers found the back of the net with less than four seconds in regulation. Sophomore goalkeeper Bethany Kanten recorded five saves, but the inability to produce chances on offense doomed the team.
“We just need to become more of a team towards the beginning of the season, and whenever we need help, just come to each other,” Casscells-Hamby said. “We need to learn from our mistakes from earlier in the season because we repeated them a couple of times.”
The team finished the season on a high note when, on Senior Day, freshman midfielder Brooke Dickens headed the ball into the goal five seconds before the final whistle to lift the team to a 1-0 victory over Columbia.
“The freshmen always make such a huge impact because they’re so excited about college soccer and about their skills.  They’re fit, and they’re really passionate, and I think this year’s freshman class really exemplified that, and they brought a lot of fun to the team,” Kanten said. “They worked really hard and really cared about and respected the seniors, so for a freshman to score on Senior Day was a really good way for us to wrap up the season and show the seniors how much they care about them.”
After winning the Ivy League the previous year, the team used this season as a rebuilding year as it adjusted to new roles on the field.
“On the field, Aisha Price started playing defense for us, and she had never played defense for us before, and she did really, really great,” Kanten said. “She won a team award for most improved player for slipping into that role, and I don’t know what we would do without her back there.”
But the team had to make adjustments off the pitch as well. For the first time since 2009, a junior co-captain, Peyton Johnson, was selected along with senior Catherine Coppinger, who is also a former Crimson sports executive.
“We had captains that had never been in that role before, so Catherine Coppinger and Peyton Johnson were both stepping into big leadership roles,” Kanten said. “It was really important for them, and I think they did a really great job.”
Despite a disappointing season, Kanten looks at the mistakes as an opportunity to learn and bounce back for the coming year.
“I think we’re going to continue a lot of the stuff we started this year, like keeping people open and being able to play different positions and being versatile—that’s a really important part of the game,” Kanten said. “A lot of things didn’t go well for us, so that means that we learned a lot, how to deal with not doing well and losing a game here and there. That motivated us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ask a Harvard sports fan which coach has taken his team from a sub-.500 winning percentage to its best record in program history and first playoff appearance in his fourth year before notching the program’s first postseason success the next season. The likely answer will be Tommy Amaker, and the guess would be wrong. Coach Amaker did not complete these feats until his fifth and sixth year.
This honor actually belongs to the other Crimson coach who owns the hardwood, men’s volleyball head coach Brian Baise. After two straight 18-win seasons, Baise has Harvard looking like an emerging force in the EIVA.
“You have to look at the arc of what the team has been able to accomplish the past five years since he’s been here, especially the past two,” co-captain Rob Lothman said. “The program was not in a great position, and he came in and has been a consistent force.”
Baise’s players point to their coach’s ability to break down game tape of opponents as crucial to their recent success. Junior co-captain Nick Madden said Baise’s instructions about defending George Mason’s sets made a difference in the Crimson’s EIVA semifinal victory.
“As far as scouting, he’s easily the best coach I’ve ever seen break down tendencies of the other team and go about finding their weaknesses,” Madden said. “We go into games very prepared and we know our opponent very well.”
Both co-captains also highlighted Baise’s role in making effective and challenging practices a focus for preparing the squad for challenging games.
“We’ve really figured out the right balance between how and what we do in practice and how that affects us in games,” Lothman said.
Madden also pointed to Baise’s skill with personnel in maximizing the players’ on- and off-the-court impact.
“He has shown that he can really cater to different personalities and motivate different people,” Madden said.
Just like a player who hopes to achieve his full potential, a good coach can become a great coach only through consistent work and improvement.Lothman believes Baise has and will continue to create a better product with Harvard volleyball.
“He has really developed into an incredible coach,” the senior said. “I believe our success over the past few years is directly attributable to him and the job that he has done.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In his decorated career with the Harvard wrestling team, co-captain Walter Peppelman was twice named an All-American, placed second in the EIWA Championships after defeating the nation’s third-ranked wrestler, and won over 100 matches.
But the team was more than just Peppelman. No Crimson wrestling team in over a decade had achieved what Harvard did this season.
For the first time since the 2000-2001 season, the Crimson finished with a winning conference and overall record. Harvard, which wrapped up its regular season with an 18-16 win over Columbia, finished 8-5 overall and 6-4 in the EIWA.
Behind Peppelman and co-captain Steven Keith—also a member of the 100-win club—the Crimson ended the season on a 5-0 run going into EIWA Championships, including an upset over No. 14 Lehigh. In the Crimson’s first ever victory over the Mountain Hawks in Bethlehem,  Penn., sophomore James Fox notched a key victory to put Harvard ahead, and the Crimson never relinquished the lead.
“It’s a great atmosphere to wrestle in,” Harvard coach Jay Weiss said. “We said we were going to have to go in there and have no fear and just take it to them. ”
The Lehigh match proved to be only one of many times that underclassmen would step up in key moments for Harvard. The Crimson’s 28-man roster contained eight freshmen and four that started consistently. Though only Jeffery Ott finished with a winning record, the rookies played key roles in several close matches throughout the season.
At 125 pounds, Ott went 21-15—including an 8-5 dual meet record—and was one win shy of making NCAA Championships, finishing fifth at the EIWA Championships. Classmate Devon Gobbo placed seventh in the same tournament in the 165-pound division. The freshmen were two of eight Crimson wrestlers to place at the event, the most since 2001.
“Confidence is a huge thing in any sport, and you’ve got to develop that confidence in the freshmen,” Weiss said. “They came from some of the top high school careers in the country, and in six months they’re wrestling at the Division I level. ”
After individual success at the EIWA tournament, Peppelman, Keith, and Fox earned bids to the NCAA Tournament in Iowa. Peppelman went in as the No. 11 seed but fell in the first round. Keith fared better in the first round, winning his match, but ultimately lost to the top seed in the next round. Fox lost both of his matches and was eliminated in his second tournament appearance in as many years.
Stepping off the mat for the last time in Des Moines, the seniors capped two of the most accomplished careers in Harvard history. Peppelman finished with 111 wins—good for fifth in program history. Keith’s 107 wins moved him into seventh.
Though Peppelman competed in his third straight NCAA Tournament, he was not named an All-American as a senior.
“I came up short at the end of the season, and that was painful, but those are the experiences that you learn and grow from,” Peppelman said. “I’m happy for what I have, and even though it didn’t end the way I wanted, my career is something I will cherish forever.”
The Crimson opened its dual meet season with a win over Rider at home but dropped five of its next seven matches. Harvard fell to Penn, 24-6, on Feb. 9 after losing a number of close matches but rebounded the next day to cruise to a 27-6 victory at Princeton.
After defeating the Tigers, the Crimson wouldn’t lose again. Closing out the season, Harvard outscored its opponents 120-54 down the stretch, including a close 16-15 victory over Columbia at the Malkin Athletic Center.
Keith and Peppelman both notched victories in the final conference matches of their careers, while Ott and fellow freshman Nick Gajdzik also picked up wins at 125 pounds and heavyweight, respectively. The Crimson came back from a 15-9 deficit after Fox soundly defeated his opponent in the 195-pound match.
Gajdzik rode Fox’s momentum and clinched the win for Harvard with a 2-0 victory to move to 7-9 on the season.
“The freshman class really pulled together from the start of the season,” Weiss said. “There is a real strong character on the team right now. It has been a lot of fun to coach, and it’s going to take us places in the future.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a tough year for the Harvard coed sailing team, which failed to qualify for any national championship regattas in the spring season. The fleet racing teams in both women and coed boats, as well as the coed team racing results last month, kept the Crimson from competing in the final rounds.
The results were a disappointment given last year’s eighth-place finish by the women’s fleet racing team at the ICSA Women’s National Championship in Texas.
This year, Harvard failed to qualify for the event after taking 12th at  the NEISA Women’s Conference Championship. This year marks the first time since 1994 that the women did not compete on the national level. The coed team, which placed fifth at nationals in 2012, also failed to qualify.
“On the whole, the season was fairly disappointing,” freshman Jacob Bradt said. “We weren’t really expecting [to not qualify], and we were really disappointed because we feel like we underperformed.”
After losing its spot in fleet racing for nationals, the Crimson shifted its focus toward getting a nationals bid in team racing.
“We showed significant improvement in terms of our team racing abilities after not qualifying for the fleet racing semifinals,” Bradt said. “We drilled down on our team racing quite a bit.”
In mid-April, the Crimson was ranked No. 15 in the nation. As of early May, Harvard’s ranking had fallen to 20th.
“We thought we underperformed on the regional level and in our qualifiers,” Bradt said. “Apart from that, we did have a few events, especially earlier in the spring, where we felt like we were improving.”
Despite how it ended, the entire year was not as sour for Harvard.
“We had some strong performances this year, including qualifying for fall championships, which was unfortunately canceled due to Hurricane Sandy,” junior co-captain Ben Lamont said.
The Crimson had 40 regattas scheduled when the season opened on Sept. 8. The fall championships were scheduled for the first two weekends in November.
The Tech Invitational and Reed Trophy regattas were postponed on the weekend of April 20 as a result of the lockdown and manhunt in the Boston area.
“Our worst races were in the fall,” Bradt said. “In the spring, we produced more mixed results.”
The greatest setback for Harvard was the age and experience of the team.
“In the beginning of last fall, we knew we were in a building year,” Bradt said. “A lot of our talent graduated last year, and we are a fairly young team.”
In the final coed fleet, the Crimson had a sophomore and freshman as skippers. Three skippers in team racing were also part of the sophomore class. Harvard started only one junior, co-captain Isabel Ruane.
“We were going up against teams with a lot more juniors and seniors [and] experience,” Bradt said.
Throughout the season, the team had to contend with more seasoned competition. Harvard’s lack of experience was an ongoing challenge for both skippers and crews.
“We sailed an obviously young team,” Lamont said.
As a result, the coaches tried their best to practice fundamental tactical boat-handling issues at the beginning of the year. Bradt noted the improvement in fundamentals that showed itself towards the end.
Improvement was a word the Crimson sailors used frequently to describe their season.
“We’re already starting to look past [not qualifying this year], and we look forward to trying to get the team better for next year,” Lamont said.
The incoming class of freshmen has created optimism within the program. The Crimson graduates only two seniors this year, Nicolas Gordon and Jason Michas.
“We have a lot of young talent on the team, and we’re excited for next season,” Lamont said. “We have excellent coaches; it was just a tough year.”
Still, it was difficult for those who had been with the program for a few years to come to terms with not meeting the expectations that come with Harvard sailing.
“In general, it was a disappointing year in that we have had such a high level of achievement for the better part of 15 years, which made it difficult not to qualify,” Lamont said. “We were an average team in an average year, but we’re a team with much higher expectations.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Things had been trending up for Harvard men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker. In 2011, he led the Crimson to its first-ever Ivy championship. The next year, Amaker guided Harvard to its first NCAA tournament appearance in 66 years. With the graduation of only two starters heading into the 2012-13 season, there was no reason to expect anything but another step forward in program history.
But by the time the season tipped off in the fall, Amaker had been tasked with perhaps the most difficult coaching challenge of his career.
With the unexpected departures from school of former co-captains Brandyn Curry and Kyle Casey, both starters on the title-winning 2011-12 squad, Amaker needed to fill a couple of gaping holes in his roster: the points and interior presence of Casey, the team’s leading scorer, and the ball-handling and perimeter defense of Curry, the only returning point guard that averaged more than two minutes per game.
“We were dealt a hand that was incredibly unexpected and, from the outside looking in, looked like it could be completely devastating,” Amaker said.
Given the extenuating circumstances, the triumph that the season would ultimately become, highlighted by the Crimson’s second-round NCAA tournament upset of three-seed New Mexico, was due in large part to the rise of the team’s young talent and the mid-season adjustments Amaker made.
“The phrase we used at the beginning of the year and carried through the rest of the year was ‘we may not have what we had, but we have enough,’” Amaker said. “That’s how we approached it—what an opportunity.”
For most coaches, one season begins the day that the previous one ends. For Amaker, the opening day of the 2012-2013 campaign was even earlier—four years earlier.
Amaker began planning for the 2012-2013 season in 2008, when he first attended now-freshman point guard Siyani Chambers’ middle school basketball contests. The time, travel, and commitment that that early recruitment took paid off in baskets, assists, and wins, as Chambers led the squad to the conference title in his rookie year.
“A lot of relationships can develop through the recruitment process,” Amaker said. “You get connected to certain guys. I’m probably more connected to our guards, point guard in particular.”
The connection between the former and current point guards led to a degree of confidence in Chambers that was key in several late-game situations throughout the season.
In addition to incorporating new faces into the lineup, Amaker had to juggle his existing talent to maximize his team’s potential.
One, if not the largest, of Amaker’s midseason coaching changes was the insertion of sophomore Kenyatta Smith into the starting lineup, a position that he never relinquished after starting against Penn. Smith provided a strong defensive presence down low, a role that was lacking in several of the  previous games. In the Feb. 15 contest against Penn and the subsequent night’s competition with Princeton, Smith contributed a combined 34 points, 16 rebounds, and 16 blocks to his team’s box score.
The weekend that this change took place was perhaps the most crucial of the season for the Crimson. With the squad’s perennial struggles against the Killer P’s and its recent loss to a struggling Columbia team, Harvard needed two wins to keep close to Princeton for first place in the conference.
“He changed our team at a critical moment,” Amaker said. “Teams evolve and change throughout the course of seasons—sometimes you start one way and have to make a detour…. There is no greater feeling as a coach [and] as a teacher than to see [a player’s growth] happening before your eyes.”
Thanks in large part to the newfound paint presence that Smith provided, the Crimson was able to sweep the weekend and take another big step toward turning what looked to be a rebuilding year into just another step forward on the program’s recent historic march.
“When you tell great stories, or read great books, or see great movies that have special moments, most of the time, if not all the time, they have to come through something that was perceived to be devastating or insurmountable,” Amaker said.

It was a season full of near misses for the Harvard men’s soccer team. The team lost seven times by one goal and only once by more than two.
Take out the 6-0 clubbing by then-No. 6 UConn, and the team only posted a -9 goal differential on the season. After a loss to Brown dropped the team to 1-7-3—the team’s fifth overtime match without a win to show for it—junior defender Ross Friedman noted that the team’s record didn’t reflect how good it was.
“It’s tough to talk about our record…but I don’t think it speaks to how good we are as a team,” Friedman said. “I think we played one of the toughest schedules in the country. We played every big-time team on the East Coast and two big-time teams on the West Coast. We’re a good team, but it’s just tough when we’re not getting the results [to back that up].”
Co-captain Scott Prozeller expressed similar frustrations after the team was shut out for the fifth time, 1-0, in a Senior Day loss to Columbia.
“I don’t think we were outplayed or outclassed, I just don’t think we came out [to play] in the first half,” Prozeller said after the game. “I think we just need to focus on putting a full 90 minutes together. I don’t think that is something we’ve been able to do all year, really executing top-to-bottom for an entire game.”
In the Ancient Eight—where the team finished in last place, a half-game behind the Yale Bulldogs—the main struggle was scoring goals. The team tied for sixth in the league with five goals in eight games and never scored more than one goal against an Ivy League opponent.
“Scoring goals is the toughest thing to do in soccer. I can speculate all over the place about why we weren’t able to [score], but I think the biggest reason is that we lacked an offensive system that would stay consistent from game to game,” junior midfielder Kevin Harrington said. “We would sit back and win the ball in our own half, but we were getting caught in possession and having to blast the ball forward without a real system or strategy.”
The team began the season with only one loss in its first three matches, tying UMass, 1-1, in the season opener and then scoring a 1-0 victory over Michigan State a week later. The inspired play of freshmen against the Spartans—goalkeepers Evan Mendez and Joe Festa shut out Michigan State, while forward Jake Freeman put in the contest’s lone goal—was, according to Harrington, representative of one of the season’s bright spots: the play of the rookie class.
“It was a lot to ask of young guys [to come] in to play so many minutes,” Harrington said. “They really stepped it up and were some of the more dedicated and consistent players on the team. I personally couldn’t have asked more from them. We are fortunate to have gotten such responsible and skilled players who are going to be huge parts of our team next year and going forward.”
The team lost four games in a row after the win against the Spartans, including the 6-0 loss to UConn that represented the low point of the season. the Huskies came in ranked in the top five nationally and dealt the Crimson its worst loss of the year.
The team’s season was a series of peaks and valleys from then on. Both non-conference wins—BU and Holy Cross—were sandwiched by a pair of conference losses. Despite this, after a season-ending loss to Penn—Harvard’s sixth consecutive in the Ivy League—co-captain Richard Smith was optimistic about the future.
“Last year the team was in pretty bad shape,” Smith said then. “Even though the results aren’t that much better, the improvements have been there, in terms of commitment to the team and to the system.”
After a season that seemed to pose more questions than answers, Harrington said that the offseason, which saw the resignation of coach Carl Junot and the hire of former California associate head coach Pieter Lehrer to lead the team, is part of a necessary change that the Crimson hopes to make. Every member of the 2009 Ivy League-winning squad is now gone from the roster, and the team will begin 2013 with a clean slate.
“I think we’re going through a transition period with the new coach coming in for next season,” Harrington said. “This season obviously didn’t go as we planned, but we learned a lot these past three years that will make us more successful going into the next season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It only took a second for the ball to fly over the net and hit the floor, but it was a moment years in the making. When sophomore middle hitter Caleb Zimmick’s serve went untouched, history was made. The Harvard men’s volleyball team had fought back from the brink of elimination to earn the program’s first playoff win in a thrilling five-set overtime match against EIVA rival George Mason.
And while most eyes were following the Crimson’s March Madness success, Harvard’s other team that plays with nets on the hardwood quietly put together the best season in the team’s history, taking another step for the program after reaching the playoffs for the first time last season.
“It was really good to show this season that we belong in the upper echelon of this league,” co-captain Rob Lothman said. “We were not a one-year wonder last year. We are a team that has got staying power and we are going to continually be there.”
The Crimson tied a program-best for wins on the season with 18. Zimmick, a second-team All-EIVA player, led the conference with a .374 kill percentage. Fellow sophomore outside hitter DJ White sat just behind Zimmick with a .314 kill percentage and earned the team’s sole spot on the all-conference first team.
Co-captains Lothman and junior outside hitter Nick Madden also served as motors of the offense, with Madden leading Harvard with 249 kills on the year. Lothman ranked third in the league in assists and earned All-EIVA academic honors while joining Zimmick and junior middle blocker Kyle Rehkemper on the All-EIVA second team.
The playoff win over the Patriots was not the program’s only “first” of the season. After two seasons of forcing five-set matches, including a Jan. 26 loss, the Crimson finally took down perennial EIVA champion Penn State with a convincing 3-0 victory at the Malkin Athletic Center. White, who missed the first meeting with the Nittany Lions due to injury, returned to notch a game-high 13 kills.
The win ended Penn State’s 51-game conference win streak that had lasted nearly five years while propelling Harvard to three more sweeps of conference opponents throughout the next two weekends of play.
But the momentum did not last, as the Crimson dropped two road matches to George Mason and Princeton before a month-long break from conference play. During that time, the team took its spring break trip to California to take on some of the country’s top teams. For the 2012 squad, successes over established programs like No. 8 Cal Baptist and No. 14 Cal-State Northridge propelled Harvard into the national spotlight and the team’s first NCAA ranking.
But the 2013 spring break trip proved less fruitful, as the Crimson was swept by UC Santa Barbara, Cal Baptist, and Concordia.
“It was a wake-up call,” Madden said. “A lot of guys, including me, were pretty proud of ourselves, and you cannot let pride take ahold of you in the middle of the season. Getting slapped around a little bit in California was very good for us in getting motivated. Coming back, we were crisp, sharp, and ready to take it into the playoffs.”
The squad went 5-1 the rest of the way to take the third seed in the playoffs, setting up a faceoff with the Patriots, the only team to beat Harvard twice during the season.
George Mason seemed ready to move on in the playoffs, taking a commanding 25-17 victory in the third set. But Harvard persevered, tying the score and getting clutch hits from Zimmick and others in overtime to take the fifth set, 19-17.
After the Nittany Lions took down Princeton in the other semi, the Crimson took the confidence gained from their earlier victory against Penn State into the team’s first EIVA championship game. But Harvard could not pull off the upset twice, falling in straight sets as Penn State won its 15th straight EIVA championship.
Lothman believes just being in the game was a big moment for the program.
“I never thought four years ago, even three years ago, our program would be in place to compete for an NCAA tournament berth,” the senior setter said. “So to get there this year and take that small step after our big step last year is huge.”
Looking forward, Lothman is hopeful for the future.
“We’re waiting for another big step, to get that Final Four berth,” he said. “I think it’s going to happen within the next couple of years. This year, we showed that we are there, we’re going to compete for it, and we belong there.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the Harvard men’s basketball team arrived at the NCAA tournament in 2012, then-freshman Wesley Saunders played a small role for the team. Playing 13.9 minutes a game, the swingman averaged a mere 3.3 points for Tommy Amaker’s Ivy League champions, who relied on the strong inside post play of Keith Wright ’12 and then-junior Kyle Casey to outmuscle opponents inside. Guards Oliver McNally ’12 and then-junior Brandyn Curry made up the backcourt, with then-sophomore sharpshooter Laurent Rivard filling out the starting lineup and helping stretch the floor around Wright and Casey.
A year later, the 6’6” sophomore was Harvard’s primary offensive weapon. The highly-touted recruit from Los Angeles became the focal point of opposing coaches’ defensive game plans. His shooting touch and ability to finish in traffic made him an ideal fit in Harvard’s revamped lineup, which relied more on outside shooting than pounding the ball inside. On the defensive end, his long frame allowed him to guard defenders in the post or in the perimeter. Against Princeton, Saunders rotated between 6’7” Ivy League Player of the Year Ian Hummer to point guard T.J. Bray as his team needed.
“We leaned on him so much [this year],” Amaker said. “We need him to guard the best perimeter opponent, to be our best playmaker and for him to be a force in rebounding. He was the best all-around player in our league [and that’s] what we’ll need from him in the future and what we think he is.”
Saunders shined from the beginning of the year, when the team traveled across the Atlantic to play preseason games in Italy. Amaker said that you could see “a progression of work ethic and improvement of confidence” in Saunders towards the end of his freshman year that carried over.
“In the summer, he took it to a different level—his work ethic, his determination, his commitment,” Amaker said. “My guess is that he would say he worked harder than he’s ever worked. In Italy, he was hands down our best player.”
At the NCAA tournament this year, Saunders said that part of his improvement over the course of the summer was not only physical but mental. In the fall, when Casey and Curry withdrew from school, the burden fell on the sophomore to take up the majority of the team’s scoring in their absence.
“A lot of it was getting mentally prepared for the whole season,” Saunders said. “I knew it would be a long season.”
The departure of Casey, in addition to the graduation of Wright, forced Amaker to adopt a different offense built around the unique talents of Saunders and freshman point guard Siyani Chambers. With the rotating cast of sophomores Jonah Travis, Steve Moundou-Missi, and Kenyatta Smith playing down low for the Crimson, Harvard used a four-out approach that relied on Saunders’ driving skills to open up outside looks for Rivard and Webster.
Saunders’ array of pull-up jumpers, mid-range floaters, and up-and-under layups forced defenses to collapse to the paint when he beat defenders off the dribble, forcing them away from the Crimson’s perimeter threats. Saunders was counted on not only to provide scoring—he averaged 16.2 points per game on the season—but to make the right pass when needed, when Chambers would swing the ball around the perimeter to find the open shot.
With few other options at shooting guard, Saunders rarely got rest. In playing 37.3 minutes a game, the sophomore delivered night after night with double-digit point totals in each game but one, the team’s final defeat against Arizona. At the tournament, the sophomore swingman credited Amaker with challenging him to raise his game on both ends during the season.
“That’s just a challenge that Coach had for me coming into the season,” Saunders said. “He told me he’d have me covering the best player and that he wanted me to lead us on offense.”
Time and time again, Saunders was the team’s rock. In both of the team’s two best wins of the non-conference season, at Boston College and California, the sophomore had 18 points. In helping Harvard stave off Dartmouth in overtime on Feb. 26, Saunders had 20 points, seven rebounds, and two blocks, as the team erased a 10-point deficit in the final moments of regulation. In two close victories against Brown—the first of which was a double-overtime barnburner—Saunders averaged 18.5 points and six rebounds.
Saunders’ year of hard work culminated with a team-high 18 points and four rebounds in the team’s second-round tournament victory against New Mexico. On the defensive end, Saunders held NBA prospect Tony Snell to just nine points on 12 shots and denied him the paint to force the Lobo into contested three after contested three. After UNM junior Kendall Williams missed a free throw with 11 seconds left, it was Saunders that emerged from a scrum with the ball, throwing it ahead to Chambers as the Crimson ran out the clock and made history.
For the sophomore combo guard, who had largely watched from the bench as Vanderbilt eliminated the Crimson in the first round in 2012, it was the culmination of a year-long transformation. It had begun with hundreds of shots hoisted in empty gyms. It had continued in arenas from California to Italy. It culminated when Saunders stepped to the line in Salt Lake City and sank two free throws with 17 seconds left to seal the victory, no longer shooting in an empty gym.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Like most Harvard freshmen, Martina Salander arrived on campus in the fall boasting a diverse array of talents. But before springtime arrived in Cambridge, Salander demonstrated that her talents were both unlike those of any other freshman, and also unlike those of any other athlete in Ancient Eight history.
In her rookie season with the Harvard track and field team, she established herself as not only the best multi-event athlete in Crimson history, but also in the history of the Ivy League.
The first-year was one of three members of the Ivy-champion Harvard women’s squad to qualify for the Indoor NCAA Championships this season. As the only freshman in the 16-competitor pentathlon field, Salander proved that her relative lack of experience was a non-factor, as she scored 4,209 points to earn fifth place.
“It was just a solid day,” the freshman said  of her performance. “I was really pleased with all of the events, especially the shot put and the long jump.”
Salander’s performance at nationals improved upon the previous Ancient Eight record, a 4,053-point outing that was set in 2001. Also, her fifth-place finish earned her the first All-American honors in school history for a Crimson multi-event athlete.
“At nationals, you know that the girl next to you is going to throw farther than she did throughout the season, and [she will] run faster, and jump farther, so it pushes you to compete stronger,” Salander said.
The rookie’s strongest component of the pentathlon at nationals was the shot put, which Salander used to propel herself up the standings. Before the shot put, which is the third of five events that comprise the pentathlon, Salander stood in 12th place. With her impressive 14.23-meter heave, she rose all the way to third place in the competition.
“She’s very, very powerful, one of the most powerful kids I’ve had the opportunity to work with,” said Crimson assistant coach Kebba Tolbert, who trains the team’s multi-event athletes. “She has a tremendous capacity for work, so some of the things that we did in training really showed up.”
Salander’s power was on display at events before the indoor national championship, as well. Rather than competing in the pentathlon at the Indoor Heptagonal Championships, to protect herself from injury, Salander instead elected to represent Harvard in three events: the individual 60-meter dash, the 60-meter hurdles, and the shot put.
“You can only do two, maybe three pentathlons during a season because it takes a lot of energy,” Salander said. “But also because I was kind of injured at that point, we didn’t want to risk anything for nationals.”
Though she failed to place in the 60-meter dash, she was able to collect nine points for the Crimson by finishing in second and sixth in the hurdles and shot put, respectively. Her time in the 60-meter hurdles ranks third in school history, and her mark in the shot put is sixth all-time.
“I was happy that I was able to help out the team a little bit,” Salander said. “[Winning Heps] was definitely one of the biggest moments in my track career so far, especially being able to do that at our home stadium…. We showed the other Ivies what we’ve got, it was great.”
Though her improvement as the season progressed led to the freshman’s All-American distinction, Salander came out of the gates firing on all cylinders for Harvard. In the team’s third week of competition in January,  the Stocklhom, Sweden, native was part of a Crimson contingent that traveled to College Station, Texas, to compete in the Texas A&M Mondo Challenge, while the rest of the team stayed behind in Boston to compete in the Terrier Invitational at Boston University.
At the meet, Salander set the Ivy League record in the pentathlon for the first time, recording 4,094 points for a second-place finish. She finished runner-up to Arizona State’s Keia Pinnick, who went on to be the runner-up at indoor nationals in the event. Salander’s mark was the first time a Harvard athlete had ever broken the 4000-point barrier.
“That was the meet where I qualified for nationals, so it was definitely important,” Salander said. “After that, we could go back [to practice] and be more focused with the training.”
Following her stellar indoor debut, Salander hit a speed bump when competition moved outdoors later in the spring. Nagging injuries that had been bothering Salander since the indoor season prevented her from competing. According to the rookie, the best way to build off a season where she set both school and Ancient Eight records is simple: stay healthy.
“Competition-wise, I was really happy [with the 2013 season], but training-wise I was not happy because I’ve been dealing with injuries,” Salander said. “I was surprised that I performed that well at nationals, but I still think that I can do better in the upcoming seasons if I can stay healthy.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the final game of senior quarterback Colton Chapple’s collegiate career, Crimson coach Tim Murphy called a screen pass, and the quarterback was not happy about it.
“[Chapple] goes, ‘Coach, that play stinks, don’t run that play,’” Murphy recalled. “I [said] ‘hey, just shut up and play,’ but he was basically right.”
The senior’s willingness to speak up and his understanding of the game were not things that would have come naturally to the signal caller just a few years ago. But Chapple’s confident leadership in the year’s final contest—a 34-24 win over Yale in which he scored three touchdowns, including a  four-yard pass to junior Cameron Brate to give Harvard the lead with three minutes to go—represented the culmination of a career that began with a one-to-one touchdown-to-interception ratio and ended with the greatest statistical season any Harvard quarterback has ever had.
During the 2012 campaign, Chapple was the architect of the highest-scoring offense in the history of the Ancient Eight. The Ivy League Offensive Player of the Year threw 24 touchdown passes and accounted for 3,169 yards of total offense, both Crimson records, while also finishing second in the Football Championship Subdivision in passing efficiency. In a 39-34 loss to Princeton on Oct. 20, Chapple broke the Harvard single-game passing mark with 448 yards while tying his own record with five touchdown passes.
“I don’t know if we’ve ever had a kid that’s ever played better,” Murphy said. “In terms of clutch performances game after game, just pinpoint accuracy, tremendous decision making.... He’s as good as anybody that’s ever played here.”
To get to that elite level, Chapple evolved as both a player and a leader over the course of his career.
Despite not being a major recruit, the Alpharetta, Ga., native got to work early in an effort to develop chemistry with his incoming teammates. The summer before coming to Harvard, Chapple traveled to nearby Dunwoody High School to throw passes to Treavor Scales, his future classmate and running back.
“He already had a grasp of some of the concepts we were running here at Harvard before we got [to school],” Scales recalled. “From that point on, I saw his leadership capabilities, and I saw too that he had one heck of a mental grasp on the game.”
Despite that mental acumen, Chapple struggled when called upon for the first time. Tasked with filling in for injured quarterbacks Andrew Hatch ’11 and Collier Winters ’12 during his sophomore season, Chapple completed just 48.8 percent of his passes and threw as many interceptions as touchdowns in three starts in 2010.
But within a year, Chapple had moved up to number two on the depth chart, and this time, when his opportunity came along after Winters injured his hamstring in the team’s season opener, the quarterback was ready to excel.
With Murphy able to take the reins off the passer in a way he hadn’t been able to a year prior, Chapple led his team to a 4-0 record during which the Crimson outscored its opponents, 138-44. The junior threw for 414 yards—second-most in Crimson history—in a shootout win over Cornell, then followed that up by tying a Harvard record with five touchdown passes a week later against Bucknell. But despite those performances, Winters was handed back his starting job in week six, and he kept it for the rest of the year.
This season, then, was the first time that Harvard was truly Chapple’s team. Finally first on the depth chart, the senior was dominant in 2012, putting up gaudy statistics despite often being pulled in the second half when his team was ahead by multiple touchdowns.
“He didn’t have a cannon for an arm, and yet...he just made play, after play, after play,” Murphy said. “He at times amazed us.”
“He really [put up] some numbers that are unbelievable,” Scales said. “The fact that he was setting records in three quarters of football—in a half—it’s astounding.”
In addition to setting numerous passing marks inside the pocket, the quarterback was also a major threat to scramble. His 602 rushing yards were fifth-best in the conference and tops among signal callers.
“You didn’t know if he was going to beat you with his feet or with his arm,” Scales said. “You had to respect every aspect of [his game]...[so] we were running against six-man boxes for the majority of the season. That’s easy money for me and the offensive line. We love that.”
And as Chapple improved as a player, he blossomed as a leader as well.
“This year he was an extraordinarily confident quarterback, and because of that, he wasn’t afraid to hold his teammates to the same high standard he holds himself,” Murphy said.
“He expects the absolute best out of everybody on every single rep,” Scales explained. “If you slack off, he will call you out; he has no problems doing it. He’s not going to, like, be a jerk to you or anything like that...but he’s going to let you know, ‘hey, I need you to give everything you’ve got.’”
Scales said that attitude gave the team an enormous amount of confidence this season.
“He’s good at keeping us on our toes, keeping the mood light to the point where we can just relax and play ball,” Scales said. “He takes control of that huddle. You can look into his eyes and know, alright, it’s time to go win this thing. And when he says that, you know we’re good to go, we’re going to win it then. He makes it seem so simple. Execution is nothing for him, it’s another order of business.”
The relationship that Chapple began building with Scales over the summer four years ago continued to flourish this season, when Chapple, according to Scales, was a “film rat.”
“All the running backs and the offensive line used to sit down together watching morning game film,” Scales explained. “And he’d always be right there with us, asking questions.”
“His football IQ was outstanding,” Murphy added. “He was like having a coach on the field.”
That intelligence will be put to good use in Chapple’s next pursuit—working as a player scout for the Cleveland Browns.
And as Chapple moves onto the next chapter in his life, it was that final Game, in which the quarterback refused to throw a screen, that capped a record-breaking season that the quarterback will never forget.
“[All the] hard work during the offseason, during the previous three years we’ve been here, kind of came to fruition [against Yale],” Chapple said. “Walking off that field with 25 other seniors who I got to share that experience with is something I’m always going to remember.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For most athletes, a national championship title is the pinnacle of a career. For Amanda Sobhy, it is simply business as usual.
The sophomore won her second straight College Squash Association Individual National Championship this year, topping Kanzy El Defrawy of Trinity for the title.
The win was no surprise. Sobhy entered Harvard two years ago widely touted as the No. 1 women’s squash player in the United States and among the top 20 players in the world. Even before her first collegiate match, the Sea Cliff, N.Y., native had five professional titles to her name.
“She’s had incredible success,” co-captain Natasha Kingshott said. “Not only in college, but professionally. Having her on the team is a great thing for us since we can learn from her.”
Sobhy entered the college circuit primed for success. The pressure of living up to the hype does not appear to have fazed her. Since suiting up for the Crimson two years ago, Sobhy has taken the collegiate squash world by storm, winning all but one of her 30 matches by a perfect 3-0 margin.
“She’s just this powerful force at number one,” Kingshott said. “We all look up to her because she has so much talent and she works so hard. Her work ethic is really incredible.”
The lone game loss of Sobhy’s collegiate career—just a few weeks before her national championship victory—came at the hands of El Defrawy in Harvard’s regular season matchup against Trinity. Playing at No. 1, the sophomore found herself for the first time on the other side of an 11-6 decision, dropping the first game of the match.
Rattled but undeterred, Sobhy stormed back, dominating the next game, 11-2. She took the next two games with 11-6 and 11-3 wins to ultimately claim the match, 3-1.
“I was bound to lose a game,” Sobhy said. “It was going to happen. When it did, I was frustrated, but I also wanted to show people that it was kind of just, like, a fluke.”
The loss gave Sobhy extra motivation in the CSA Team National Championship, where she topped El Defrawy, 11-8, 11-7, 11-8, to clinch the Howe Cup for Harvard. The loss also provided some added incentive when she faced her opponent one last time that season, with both eyeing the individual title.
“It definitely gave me motivation to show people that losing a game was not really supposed to happen,” Sobhy said. “I just wanted to show that, even with the top people, I can still be 3-0. It was definitely motivation, and I’m so competitive, so I wanted to get that 3-0 win [at nationals].”
With her win against El Defrawy, Sobhy became the first player in over a decade to clinch back-to-back Ramsay Cups. But her quest is not over yet, as the sophomore hopes to become the first player in over 30 years to win four straight individual national titles. The only other player in women’s collegiate squash history to achieve such a feat was Gail Ramsay of Penn State, who took the individual titles from 1977 to 1980. Currently the head coach of Princeton women’s squash, Ramsay bears her name on the cup that Sobhy has now hoisted twice.
“She does feel a lot of pressure,” Kingshott said. “But she has such mental toughness that she handles the expectation of always winning at number one and winning her collegiate title again with so much grace.”
For all her collegiate success, Sobhy still remains a force to be reckoned with on the professional circuits, as she balances her time between academics, collegiate athletics, and the professional tour. The decision to come to Harvard meant putting aside much of her professional squash schedule for the next four years. The professional tour runs from September to May, directly coinciding with her college squash season. But despite the conflict, Sobhy does her best to stay competitive on the circuit.
“I think this year, I was a little more mature than last year,” Sobhy said. “I kind of learned from my mistakes last year, and I was able to map out a better schedule for my training and my performances, which helped. I think definitely this season I was playing better than last season.”
Most recently, Sobhy helped Team USA clinch the 2013 World Doubles Championship in mid-April. The sophomore teamed with 35-year-old Natalie Grainger to win the open division, topping the Canadian duo of Seanna Keating and Stephanie Hewitt in the finals.
The pair met just weeks earlier in the finals of the 2013 U.S. National Championship, where Grainger upset the top-seeded Sobhy. The tournament came just a week after the close of Sobhy’s college season.
“No one really tells you how hard it is to balance academics and athletics,” Sobhy said. “You just have to manage your time well at both. I love playing professional and college squash, and being a student, sometimes you have to sacrifice one thing for another. Sometimes you have to put more effort into academics and put squash on the side, and sometimes you have to focus more on the squash. It’s just basically all about time management. It’s pretty hard, though.”
As the top-ranked American in the world and with two collegiate individual titles under her belt, Sobhy seems to have found a way to be successful on both circuits.
“She’s just a phenomenal athlete,” Kingshott said. “She really is.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On April 27, Harvard H-back Kyle Juszczyk achieved a feat that hadn’t been accomplished by any Crimson football player in eight years.
After much speculation as to where the Ohio native would continue his football career, the Baltimore Ravens picked Juszczyk with the 130th pick of the NFL draft.
“[Juszczyk was] by far the most versatile player we’ve ever had, and that’s one of the reasons he’s playing in the NFL,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “Beyond his extraordinary physical ability that you need to play at the pro level, he had just a great football IQ.  He was a high school quarterback, but he’s one of those guys where you tell him once and he just got it. He had great instincts, and he also loved the challenge of having to master several positions of the true H-back.”
Juszczyk’s value to NFL teams stemmed from the same versatility that allowed Murphy the flexibility to use different formations with the same offensive package on the field.
A two-time All-American selection, Juszczyk was invaluable to the offense as a blocker for the top rushing offense in the Ivy League. But the senior’s role was expanded beyond the traditional tight end position, as Juszczyk became Chapple’s primary target and led the receiving corps, notching over 700 yards receiving and pulling down eight touchdowns.
“He was a terrible matchup problem in the run game, when we wanted to have him as a lead blocker, and he was a tough matchup for safties and linebackers when they had to try to cover him in the slot position,” Murphy said. “When you put him in the wing position, we were able to play-action pass him, send him up the seam. At a high tempo, it was really difficult for defensive coordinators and defenses in general to know what to call.”
Juszczyk recorded his best performance of the season in a heartbreaking loss against Princeton when he tallied 192 yards and three scores in a 39-34 Harvard loss. The senior helped the Crimson become the most prolific offense in the Ancient Eight as the team topped the Ivy League with nearly 40 points per game, almost 13 more than next-best Cornell.
“When you knew Juice was getting the ball, you just thought it was unfair for everyone else because you knew that it would take five or six guys to bring him down to the turf,” senior running back Treavor Scales said. “He’s a special player, and it was backed up by the fact that he got picked up in the fourth round. He’s a very special football player, and he’s the epitome of a football player. He’s out there having fun, flying around, talking trash, and it’s great to be around him—you just want to be around a guy like that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following the departures of the entire 2012 backcourt, the Harvard men’s basketball team needed someone to step up. Oliver McNally had graduated, senior Brandyn Curry had taken a leave of absence, and sophomore Corbin Miller had left on a two-year mission for the Church of Latter Day Saints. The only person left in the rotation was 6’6” sophomore wing Wesley Saunders, who had played fewer than 15 minutes a game in 2011-2012.
Saunders responded to the added responsibility and more than doubled his minutes in leading the team and Ivy League in scoring with 16.2 points per game. With the backcourt rotation decimated by the three departures, he played without a true backup and was on the court more than 37 minutes a game. Saunders spent most of his minutes guarding the opposing team’s best player on defense while being the focal point of the team’s offensive attack on the other end.
“He really did a terrific job this past summer in working hard to get better,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “He didn’t play a lot [last year], and that was motivating him. He worked really hard, and he was our best player on our [Italy] tour. He knew that, and we told him that, and it really propelled him into the year.”
Amaker said that Saunders’ ability to finish in traffic near the rim, where he used his length to unleash a deadly variety of floaters and reverse layups on opponents, was key for the team. This often isolated the sophomore as the shot clock ran down, allowing him to take his man one-on-one to the rim.
“Wesley has been a huge finisher for the team,” Amaker said after the regular-season ending victory over Cornell. “He’s an incredible finisher, and that’s why he shoots such a high percentage.”
Saunders was consistent in addition to being effective. He scored 10 or more points in each game of the year but the last—where he chipped in five rebounds and five assists to go with his eight points. In the team’s first seven Ivy League games, Saunders averaged 19.4 points as Harvard jumped out to a 6-1 league start. Against Dartmouth on Jan. 26, when the team overcame a 10-point deficit in the closing minutes of regulation, Saunders had 20 points, seven rebounds, six assists, and two blocks.
“The thing that I’ve been pleased with more than anything else is how consistent he has been,” Amaker said. “He has become more than a good practice player. He has had to be our best perimeter defender, one of our best rebounders, and at times I have apologized to him in front of the team for what we ask [of him]. The changes that he and Siyani have brought and what they have done for our program is phenomenal.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In college softball, it’s hard to improve on a season in which one hits .372 with six home runs and 40 runs batted in. Yet in a season with many new faces, junior third baseman Kasey Lange stepped up her production to another level.
This season, Lange was responsible for an RBI per game, driving in 43 in as many games and leading the Ivy League once again. She also batted .346 with an astounding 13 home runs, setting the Harvard record for most career homers with one season still to play.
“Kasey sets the tone at the plate,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said. “She’s fearless, and that’s a great attitude to have.”
Lange’s accomplishments have extended beyond her talents at the plate. She has stepped up in the field as well, turning six double plays and making only six errors playing at the hot corner.
“She emerged defensively this year and made some unbelievable plays in the infield,” Allard said.
Her all-around play earned Lange a unanimous first team all-Ivy League selection. The team has recognized her leadership as well, choosing her to be co-captain next year.
“Kasey is an absolute boss,” sophomore infielder Emily Gusse said. “We communicate really well and get each other on and off the field, so it’s been awesome to see her success. Everyone wants to follow in her footsteps. She’s an awesome leader, an awesome example, and a really good teammate.”
Despite all of her individual accomplishments, Lange could not lead her team to a second consecutive Ivy League championship.
“It was obviously a disappointing end to the season, especially with such a young team,” Lange said.
In the last weekend, the team needed to win three games against Dartmouth in order to advance to the Ivy League Championship Series. After splitting the first doubleheader of the weekend, Harvard was unable to keep pace, losing 5-4 to the Big Green, and was knocked out of contention for the league title.
With the Crimson’s youth gaining experience, Lange firmly believes in the team’s ability to perform next season. Harvard graduates only four players from this year’s squad.
“I think we are going to work on maturing as a team,” Lange said. “We are coming in with nine of the same starters.”
Despite all her accomplishments, Allard believes that Lange still has room to improve in her final season in Cambridge.
“One thing she can improve on is being more consistent,” Allard said. “She didn’t have a great preseason, but she really hit her stride during conference play. At the beginning of the season, she was trying to do too much in the lineup. She does her best when she lets the ball and the game come to her.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With 38 seconds left in overtime against Hofstra, senior Victoria Lippert sunk two free throws to give the Harvard women’s basketball squad its first lead of the extra period. Moments later, teammate Christine Clark hit two more to cushion the lead to three points and secure the victory.
Just as she did all season, including in a Princeton game in which she hit four consecutive free throws to ensure the three-point win, the San Diego native hit clutch shots to lead her team to victory.
“Victoria is maybe at the top of the list of all student-athletes I’ve coached in the 30-odd years I’ve been coaching,”Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “If she’s not the best, she’s one of the best athletes who can handle pressure and who wants the ball in her hands with a chance to win.”
Despite the disappointment of ceding the Ivy League championship to Princeton, the team matched its postseason performance of the year before, winning its first game against Hartford in the WNIT before losing to the eventual champions, Drexel.
Lippert was key in the victory over the Hawks, hitting jumpers and draining a three-pointer to extend the lead when Hartford came close to reclaiming the edge. The senior, who led the team with 51 three-pointers on the season and is second in the Harvard record books with 185 career treys, powered the Crimson’s offense with 19 points.
“I think, in every game, no matter who the opponent is, I bring the same level of intensity and desire to win,” Lippert said. “So I think definitely when the game is on the line or during important games, I want to come through and do whatever I can to win those games.”
After three years of selection to the All-Ivy Second Team, Lippert, who averaged 13.7 points per game, was named to the All-Ivy First Team after her final campaign.
Although the senior was not completely content with the final result of the Ivy schedule, the 20-win year, an undefeated home record, and a postseason victory sweetened Lippert’s last season in a Harvard uniform.
“I think winning the title was the biggest goal, so it’s hard to be completely satisfied,” Lippert said. “But I’m very proud to have gotten to play for Harvard and for the successes that we have had.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the first freshman in conference history to be selected to the All-Ivy First Team, the national leader among freshmen in minutes per game played, and the runner-up for rookies in assists per game with 5.6 a game, it is safe to say that point guard Siyani Chambers had a memorable first year on campus. Especially considering Chambers wasn’t even supposed to be in the starting lineup.
Following the departure of several key contributors from the 2011-2012 squad, Chambers was forced to step up—and to do so quickly. A season after winning a Minnesota high school state championship, Chambers was handed the responsibility of leading the Crimson’s offense as he learned it on the fly.
“I’m not sure there is a more important player than Siyani and that’s who he has been for us,” said Harvard coach Tommy Amaker at the NCAA Tournament’s press conference in Salt Lake City. “At the beginning of the season, I remember thinking, considering the circumstances and all the things I knew about, how incredibly important he was going to be.”
Chambers’ contributions, according to both Amaker and his teammates, were both qualitative and quantitative. Leading the conference in assists and finishing second on the team with 12.4 points per game, Chambers pushed the ball on offense while being one of the team’s most consistent defenders, indicated by his 1.4 steals per game.
When sophomore Wesley Saunders, the team’s leading scorer, was asked about his own improvement this season, Saunders said it was in part the efforts of backcourt-mate Chambers that allowed him to flourish.
“Siyani is great,” Saunders said in March. “It’s been a collective effort on offense and defense.”
Chambers’ performance pushed the team to new heights. Not only was he productive on the stat sheet, but what Amaker called his “presence,” “vision,” and “command…on the floor” also led the coach to declare after the March 9 game against Cornell that the contribution Chambers made to this program was “phenomenal.”
For Chambers, the culmination of the season in the NCAA Tournament was important not only as proof of the team’s achievements, but also as a realization of his individual goals.
“In high school and coming up you are always watching [March Madness] and wishing you were a part of it,” Chambers said. “Hearing our team’s name being called, it was very nice and it is very exciting for our team as well.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a squad that preaches “Team First,” it might seem difficult to single out and recognize an individual player. But co-captain Jillian Dempsey is no ordinary player.
Whether getting to loose pucks, generating scoring chances, or blocking shots, the forward has come to embody the toughness that characterizes Harvard women’s hockey.
“She’s a goal-scorer, but she also makes those gritty plays,” co-captain goalkeeper Laura Bellamy said. “She’s not afraid to get in front of pucks and be tough.”
Of the 33 games in which the graduating senior played this season, she recorded a negative plus-minus just four times.
“You will never in your life find someone that works harder,” Dempsey’s linemate junior Lyndsey Fry added. “She certainly taught me what it means to be a Harvard hockey player.”
Dempsey was rewarded for her work ethic this past season. She paced the Crimson with 24 goals and 21 assists. The numbers, virtually identical to her junior season totals of 27 and 21, respectively, put Dempsey at 18th in the country in scoring and brought her career totals to 76 and 72, making her the ninth-most prolific scorer in Harvard history.
“She’s fast, and she’s strong for her size,” Bellamy said. “But the biggest thing that everyone will say about her is how passionate she is.”
The savvy veteran drew on that passion when it mattered most.
In the ECAC semifinals, Dempsey recorded a goal to give the Crimson a cushion that it would not surrender before finding Parker on an empty-netter to put the game away.
Recording 11 goals and eight assists, Dempsey was awarded back-to-back ECAC Player of the Month awards in November and December.
Her play attracted national attention as well. After spending significant chunks of time with the U.S. national team in 2011-2012, Dempsey was invited back to try out for the national team this upcoming June.
“I tried to give it my best, work hard, and have fun,” Dempsey said. “Luckily for me, the pieces fell together, and it worked out nicely.”
But what Dempsey did off the ice was equally noteworthy.
“Our team has so much respect for her,” Bellamy said.
Dempsey’s leadership will surely be missed next season, as the Crimson enters life under new management following the temporary departure of head coach Katey Stone, who is leaving to take over the U.S. women’s national team for its Olympic campaign.
“On the ice, off the ice, you are not going to find someone who will push you quite like [Dempsey did],” Fry said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Athletes and coaches often talk about not letting numbers define them. While statistics tell part of the story, sports cannot be reduced to field goal percentages and batting averages. Recruiters often look beyond the numbers to find blossoming talent; player intangibles can balance out a poor statistical year. The impetus to avoid an entire year or career of work being boiled down to a series of numbers is understandable. However, in the Ivy League recruiting process, a single number as simple as it is misunderstood can make or break a student-athlete’s collegiate future: the Academic Index.
The Academic Index, or AI, is a combination of a student’s class rank and SAT scores typically calculated for seniors. Every prospective Ivy League student is assigned a number, which ranges from 60 to 240—a perfect score. The AI is divided into three categories. While the first two reflect SAT I and SAT II scores, the third is a combination of class rank and GPA adjusted on the same 20 to 80 scale to round out the score. Although the league does not disclose its data, the New York Times estimated that the average student at an Ivy League institution has an AI around 220, with Harvard, Yale, and Princeton boasting slightly higher averages than their other Ancient Eight counterparts.
“The AI does not make decisions for us,” Director of Admissions Marlyn E. McGrath-Lewis ’70-’73 said in an e-mail. “It provides a way to gauge how each Ivy institution does in enrolling ‘representative’ students who are recruited athletes. The league created the AI exactly for that purpose.”
Ivy League rules dictate that no athletic department is permitted to have an average AI among its student-athletes more than one standard deviation below the average for non-athlete enrollees in a given class. This limits the pool of potential recruited athletes but also ensures that the Ivy League can maintain its point of pride: having student-athletes who “annually compile the country’s best records in the NCAA Academic Performance Ratings,” as per the league website.
But not everything about the AI is as clear-cut as how it is calculated.
OUT ON THE RECRUITING TRAIL
During their recruiting process, Ivy League coaches face unique difficulties at each turn. According to Ivy League policy, coaches are unable to offer athletic scholarships to prospective student-athletes. In football, the Ancient Eight’s ban on postseason competition is an impediment to recruiting; without a major television network, the league as a whole cannot promise athletes the national television exposure other conferences can.
Much more constraining are the academic standards of the member institutions. The Ivy League has set a minimum AI of 176 for any student-athlete offered admission, corresponding roughly to a 3.0 GPA and an 1140 out of 1600 on the SAT I. However, each team’s AI must remain within one standard deviation (estimated to be between 12-16 points) of the average AI for the entire student body. Given that no Ivy League institution has an average AI below 200, no athletic program in the Ancient Eight approaches that 176 threshold.
According to The New York Times, nationally an average student-athlete has an AI of 150—three or four standard deviations below the typical Ivy League sports team average. The AI limits the pool of potential recruits from the start, allowing—or forcing—coaches to focus their efforts on targeting high-achieving students.
“[The AI] is an important factor to take into consideration,” Yale men’s basketball coach James Jones said. “It doesn’t mean much in terms of admissions, but for recruiting we have got to make sure we fit in the floor and ceiling.”
Every team must be within one standard deviation of the campus AI, but beyond that individual athletes are classified into four “bands” representing distance from the campus mean. Recruits range from Band 1, with AIs above the campus mean, to Band 4, with an AI score more than two standard deviations below the campus mean. Depending on the size of a recruiting class, coaches can have more or less latitude to recruit players with a greater spectrum of AI scores, using high scores to buoy a team average.
GETTING YOUR FOOT IN THE DOOR
Once a coach decides on a player, there is no guarantee that the admissions office will offer a spot to the recruit. Coaches can provide verbal commitments to their recruits but ultimately must rely on relationships developed with the admissions office to secure a player’s spot.
Coaches at Harvard work with admissions officers like McGrath in clearing potential recruits before they apply to the University. Because of the presence of the minimum AI, as well as the individual team requirements, a recruit’s academic and athletic profiles are considered together. Harvard men’s tennis coach David Fish ’72 said that when he targets potential athletes, he considers them holistically. A graduate of Harvard himself, Fish said that he looks for students who will thrive in the competitive and rigorous academic environment.
“Our process is such that we are already looking for people who are going to be comfortable and a credit to Harvard,” Fish said. “Harvard’s academic mean is so high, the standard is so high that you want students there who have a special gift. You want those people to be comfortable in this environment. We use [the AI] because the Ivies have all agreed to do it, but we want to admit students in the same way that other students are looked at.”
From the perspective of an admissions officer, a recruited athlete must satisfy the same standards as the rest of the class. Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 uses what he calls
“the broken leg test” to evaluate prospective student-athletes, who, when admitted, enroll at much higher rates than the average admitted student. According to an article in The Daily Princetonian, athletes typically enroll at a 92-94 percent rate, 35 percent higher than Princeton’s general enrollment rate.
“Say a student who happens to be an athlete or a dancer breaks his or her leg in five places and can never participate, is this still a good admission?” Fitzsimmons said he and the admissions committee ask themselves. “Will the person be able to take the energy, the drive, the commitment that went into becoming a great dancer or a great athlete, or whatever else it may have been, and turn that into something positive?”
Likewise, both Jones and Fish said that the AI plays only a small part in how coaches and admissions officers assess potential students. If the Academic Index didn’t exist, Jones said, the admissions process would change little.
“[The AI] is something we use to make sure we get the best student-athletes that we can, but a student’s writing samples, what they’ve done in high school, how they perform in their interview...all these things are more important to admissions than the AI,” Jones said.
“It’s a guideline we use, but it isn’t something we live or die by,” Fish added.
A CULTURE THAT VALUES ACADEMICS
A recruit’s career does not end at admission, however. The Academic Index has no direct bearing on athletic ability and is no harbinger of future success. In a 2011 interview with The New York Times, Jones commented that it was possible to artificially adjust the AI of individual teams simply by changing the members on a squad’s bench.
“You can make your number whatever you want by recruiting kids just for their high AI, and who cares if they play?” Jones said at the time. “It is done. Not here at Yale, but it is done.”
Though the AI, like most recruiting guidelines, opens itself up to potential loopholes, there is, in theory, a self-correcting mechanism because unqualified students are unable to keep up academically.
When students arrive at Harvard, with higher academic expectations for its students, they are expected to succeed in a number of ways no matter the circmstances of their admissions. Scheduling that places the majority of athletic events—such as all Ancient Eight basketball games—on the weekends means that athletes rarely can excuse themselves from class and are held to the same standard as their peers.
“[The admissions committee is] trying to invest in futures and the skills and character traits they see in those people,” Fish said. “[If there] is an exception from the numerical measurement...it is a special kid with special leadership abilities. I think it’s a credit to their judgment; they make terrific choices.”
Even before they arrive on college campuses, the academic futures of student-athletes are already given substantial attention. High school and preparatory academy athletic departments across the country closely monitor their athletes’ scholastic pursuits, preparing them for an ever more rigorous college admissions process.
Michael Potempa, the Athletic Director at Montverde Academy—a school that boasts current and former Harvard men’s basketball players, including current sophomore forward Steve Moundou-Missi, as alumni—noted that his school, like fellow Ivy feeders Harvard-Westlake and Northfield Mount Hermon, among others, takes pride in sending student-athletes to Ivy League institutions. Potempa credits the school’s practices with much of the success.
“One of the things we try to instill in them here is that we have a very similar setup as college athletic programs,” Potempa said. “The expectations [we have for our students] are high. [We have] weekly grade reports [and] study halls for athletes who need a certain arrangement with quiet monitoring in the library with a coaching staff.”
Though performance on the field can be given more attention than performance in the classroom, institutions like the AI allow for an expanded view of what being a successful student-athlete means. Athletic and academic success can be a vicious tradeoff; stories of illiterate professional athletes like NFL All-Pro defensive end Dexter Manley demonstrate that, in pursuit of athletic success, academics can be lost in the shuffle.
In the Ivy League—a conference known more for its Nobel Prizes than Heisman Trophies—the AI has helped preserve the league’s primary academic goals. Recently, Jones adds, this has not prevented on-court success.
“Our league has done quite well basketball-wise recently,” Jones said. “Cornell going to the Sweet 16, Harvard making the second round; clearly something is working.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a three-year reform process, the first structural changes to the oldest corporate body in the Western hemisphere are nearly complete. A 13th member will join the Harvard Corporation—Harvard’s highest governing body, also known as the President and Fellows of Harvard College—this summer, rounding off reforms that leave the Corporation looking very different from the group that Harvard President Henry Dunster first called to order in 1650.
Facing criticism that the body was disconnected and too secretive, University leaders initiated changes in 2010 to increase engagement with the University community and to allow for more diverse skill sets and opinions.
“We wanted a broader range of expertise, given that the University is so much larger, more complex, incorporates many more dimensions of life than it did in 1650,” said University President Drew G. Faust, a member of the Corporation herself.
Now, with the changes nearly complete, members and university governance experts say that these reforms have been largely successful. Along with its growth in size, the Corporation has expanded its contact with Harvard’s stakeholders by adding members that are increasingly involved with Harvard life.
IN WITH THE NEW
In a December 2009 Boston Globe op-ed, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences professors Frederick H. Abernathy and Harry R. Lewis ’68 criticized the Corporation for lacking accountability, transparency, and the size necessary to govern effectively. As an example, Abernathy and Lewis blamed the Corporation for the University’s loss of billions of dollars during the financial crisis.
“The Harvard Corporation is a dangerous anachronism. It failed its most basic fiduciary and moral responsibilities,” they wrote. In addition to calling for the resignation of “some of its members,” Abernathy and Lewis attributed the body’s mistakes to an antiquated structure.
“It is too small, too closed, and too secretive to be intensely self-critical, as any responsible board should be,” they wrote.
In the spring of 2010, the Corporation launched an internal review of its policies with the creation of a Governance Review Committee. That group released a report at the end of 2010 announcing sweeping changes to the board—many of which addressed the problems identified by Abernathy, Lewis, and other members of the Harvard community.
“This was President Faust’s initiative,” Corporation Senior Fellow Robert D. Reischauer ’63 said, calling her the “prime mover” of the reforms.
That report called for increasing the body’s size from 7 to 13 members, imposing six-year terms limited to two in number, and creating three committees that include Corporation members and other experts.
Since that report, the Corporation has implemented reforms gradually by adding one or two members at a time, avoiding sudden and dramatic change that Reischauer said could have threatened the group’s cohesion.
“A kind of camaraderie develops among that group that facilitates cooperation and yet doesn’t cause people to be reticent in any way. It’s almost like family at a dinner table,” Reischauer said.
Harvard Business School professor and governance expert Jay W. Lorsch said that it is too soon to assess the success of the reforms, but that he thinks that the involvement of more people will indeed result in more productive and informed conversation.
“The intent is absolutely appropriate and I believe it will work,” he said. “I think generally I’m positive about what they’ve been doing.”
A BIGGER TABLE
With a larger group and three new committees dedicated to specific topics, the Corporation has access to a broader base of expertise, talent, and knowledge. Both Reischauer and Faust described this as the reforms’ most important contribution.
In addition to what Faust described as a “noisier conversation” in a larger room at a larger table, Corporation members said that the addition of more members has unequivocally improved the Corporation’s ability to govern.
“I always say, we learn from our differences,” said Lawrence S. Bacow, who joined the Corporation in 2011. “And having people with different perspectives and different experiences on the Corporation just enormously enriches the conversation.”
Higher education is among the areas of expertise that are now better represented.
Bacow, who served as president of Tufts University and as chancellor of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Susan L. Graham ’64, professor emerita at the University of California, Berkeley, join former Duke University and Wellesley College President Nannerl O. Keohane.
“What it means is that there are people who have the capacity to say, ‘Well, there are other ways of doing this, and in fact it’s done differently at other places. Maybe we can learn from them,’” Bacow said.
But a larger Corporation is not the only way that members said reforms have led to more nuanced, informed decision-making.
Three new committees that include Corporation members and other experts—finance, governance, and facilities and capital planning—began meeting in 2011. A committee on alumni affairs and development that works with the Board of Overseers, Harvard’s other, larger governing body, was also created.
“The structure, by allowing us to add non-Corporation members to the committees who’ve been specifically selected because of their subject matter expertise, has just enormously expanded the capability of the Corporation,” said Bacow, who chairs the committee on facilities and capital planning.
He cited Thomas P. Glynn’s participation on his committee as an example of useful non-member participation. As Chief Operating Officer of Partners HealthCare, Glynn oversaw the construction of laboratories for the not-for-profit health care system. Bacow said this experience put Glynn in a unique position to advise the Corporation on similar matters.
“There’s a level of sophistication in the conversation from having them at the table, which is just invaluable,” said Bacow.
BACK TO BOSTON
When University leaders touted governance reforms in 2010, they frequently cited access to a greater pool of expertise as the reforms’ most important goal. Since then, the reforms have improved the Corporation’s engagement with Harvard’s thousands of stakeholders in more ways than directly prescribed by planned reforms. With more members, the board has become increasingly Boston-based and Harvard-connected.
Among the Corporation’s new members are Boston attorney William F. Lee ’72, local businessman Joseph J. O’Donnell ’67, and Bacow, president-in-residence at Harvard’s Graduate School of Education.
Lorsch said that at its inception, the Corporation was composed strictly of members who lived in greater Boston. But, as time progressed and rules relaxed, members began to leave the area. As a result, intimate involvement with the University became more difficult.
With more members working in and around Cambridge and Boston and others traveling to Harvard frequently, it has become easier for the Corporation to monitor the pulse of the University in person.
“That means that they are present and able to come to sporting events [and] to be involved in a variety of activities on campus,” Faust said.
For example, she said, the Corporation’s three Bostonians spoke with staff members and deans at a farewell reception for Education School Dean Kathleen McCartney.
“It was a moment where the permeability of the Corporation was very much in evidence,” Faust said.
Members said that as reforms were being implemented the Corporation increased its communication with administrators and faculty members in more formal ways as well.
“At the completion of Drew’s fifth year as president, a number of us on the Corporation conducted interviews with faculty, staff, and some students also,” Bacow said. “Just to get people’s sense of how the University was doing, and how she was doing.”
Reischauer, who said the Corporation interviewed 106 stakeholders, added that this practice had not been employed prior to the reforms and that he found it “tremendously informative.”
The Board of Overseers—Harvard’s second-highest governing body—also has an unprecedented presence in discussions with the reformed Corporation. Until Reischauer’s appointment in 2002, no Overseer had ever been appointed to the Corporation. Now, four of the new members are former Overseers.
Renewed Corporation engagement with the greater Harvard community transcends traditional governance responsibilities, Corporation members said. They hold informal dinners with affiliates, attend conferences, and give presentations, such as one by Keohane at the second annual Harvard Initiative for Learning and Teaching conference held this May.
BACKROOM BOARDROOM
Though members said that their access to the community has increased because of the reforms, the Corporation remains largely secretive in its operations, and does not divulge its meetings’ minutes.
Corporation members, however, maintain that their counsel is more transparent than it may be perceived to be. Reischauer said that while the Corporation’s deliberations may not be immediately accessible, they are reflected by Faust’s rhetoric and actions.
“Our voice about what transpires at Corporation meetings is really Drew,” he said.
Reischauer said that the Corporation’s recent deliberations have revolved primarily around questions of the budget, facilities planning, and now, the capital campaign. The Corporation seeks to be transparent about these issues, but continues to keep some things hidden when necessary, he said.
“We certainly will try to be as transparent as we can while preserving the ability to provide the University with fiduciary decisions,” Reischauer said.
Still, Faust said that unrefined ideas must be allowed to flow freely for the Corporation to improve and build on them effectively.
“I think sometimes it’s good to be able to have conversations about issues that aren’t fully baked, that may never see the light of day, that are things on my mind that aren’t going to result necessarily in a new program or an action of any sort,” said Faust. “But I think those are conversations that one wants to have without having to have them on the front page of The Crimson. And that is a very valuable aspect of the group.”
Lorsch said he agreed that in order for Faust to fully benefit from the Corporation’s counsel, its conversations should remain under wraps.
“It’s easier to have those kinds of discussions out of the sunlight,” he said.

Reischauer ’63 said that while the Corporation’s actions and rhetoric may not be immediately accessible, they reflect Faust’s decisions. In fact, Reischauer said that while the deliberations of the Corporation were not immediately accessible, they are reflected by Faust’s public communications.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the course of a half-century at Harvard Law School, Alan M. Dershowitz has seen many former students seek elected office. In fact, he usually offers them a small campaign contribution, regardless of their political affiliation.
But one alumnus declined the offer—Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz.
Dershowitz still recalls the “humorous exchange” in which Cruz offered a playful explanation with a heavy dose of political truth.
“‘I’m not sure if this would hurt my reputation or your reputation the most,’” Dershowitz recalled Cruz telling him, because in some ways, Dershowitz has built a career as a lawyer defending liberal causes anathema to today’s Republicans.
Cruz was just one of many prominent, if reluctant, Harvard graduates in the 2012 election cycle. As both presidential candidates distanced themselves from their Harvard degrees, and Law School professor Elizabeth Warren shied away from her Cambridge connections to win a hotly contested Senate race, Harvard diplomas came off as electoral liabilities in many political theaters.
But a more sweeping view of Harvard graduates running for office, in both large and small contests around the country, reveals a much more nuanced approach to “dropping the H-bomb.” In some districts, a prestigious diploma can set a candidate apart from the crowd, and provide welcome legitimacy. In others, alumni can set up their Harvard connection as an ideological counterpoint, clarifying their own positions by rejecting their alma mater.
No matter the race, a Harvard degree will attract attention—and typically, the most successful candidates try to weave that scrutiny into a narrative that resonates with voters.
PUSHING BACK
Facing public perception of Harvard as an elitist, and often liberal, bastion of privilege, many of the most high-profile Harvard graduates in politics try to clarify their platforms by contrasting their “roots” to their Harvard education.
Cruz made headlines this February when a New Yorker article quoted from an old speech in which the senator decried Harvard Law School for having more Communists than Republicans in the faculty during the early 1990s.
The senator responded by affirming his remarks and distancing himself, at least rhetorically, from his alma mater.
“If you’re running for the Senate in Texas, you don’t run as a Harvard grad,” said Dershowitz, who remembered Cruz as a “brilliant” conservative outlier at a liberal law school. “You run as the anti-Harvard.”
Cruz has been compared to former presidential candidate and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, who once criticized Barack Obama for spending “too much time at Harvard” during his three-year law program—despite Romney spending four years at Harvard and earning degrees from both the Law School and Business School.
“I don’t think he had any problems with his Harvard degree until the election,” said Detlev F. Vagts ’48, a Law School professor who organized Harvard’s J.D./M.B.A. program when Romney passed through it in the early 1970s.
The anti-Harvard posture cultivated by Cruz and Romney is a common one for conservative candidates who spent formative school years at the so-called “Kremlin on the Charles,” especially when those candidates return to home districts that tend to vote red.
“I think most people in elective office hide their affiliation with Harvard because it doesn’t make you popular. There’s a certain arrogance associated with Harvard people,” Tennessee Representative and Law School graduate Jim H. S. Cooper told The Crimson last year.
“If you have any political instinct at all, you know that,” added Cooper, who is widely known in the House as a fiscally conservative “Blue Dog” Democrat.
But even liberal legislators in New England have reason to fear the perception of entitlement that comes with a Harvard diploma.
“The fashion is to tell a story of hardship overcome,” said U.S. Representative James A. Himes ’88, a Democrat who represents Connecticut’s fourth district. “[Harvard] is definitely an emblem of privilege, which has problems from an overtly political standpoint.”
Himes, whose district includes some of the wealthiest zip codes in the nation as well as several poorer areas, finds that he can mitigate the negative connotations of his Harvard degree by emphasizing his journey from the public school system to the Ivy League.
TACIT ACCEPTANCE
Longtime Representative Barnett “Barney” Frank ’61-’62, whose district included wealthy Boston suburbs for more than 30 years, took a different approach. While rarely emphasizing his years in Cambridge to voters, Frank has stayed close to the University.
“Barney is a rough-and-tumble kind of guy,” said Dan Payne, a Democratic strategist who spent years as an aide to Frank. “I’ve worked for Barney since 1980, and I cannot remember when we said the words ‘Harvard University.’ It just wasn’t in his narrative.”
Still, Frank spoke at Harvard’s Class Day ceremony last year, and in December, he told the Boston Globe that he hopes to teach at Harvard, eventually.
Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78, another double Harvard graduate, takes a similar tack. Still, Payne said that the degrees are an easier sell for Patrick, who grew up on the South Side of Chicago before coming to Massachusetts on a scholarship to Milton Academy, an elite prep school. Patrick’s image as a skilled orator connects with his Harvard degree without appearing elitist, Payne said.
“Some people are more obviously Harvard than others,” Payne said. “Deval Patrick is obviously more Harvard than Barney Frank.”
But even in districts far removed from the Crimson dynasties of Massachusetts—where 32 of the last 71 governors have held a Harvard degree—candidates can profit from quietly standing by a Harvard connection.
When Alexander “Anders” Blewett ’03 sought elected office in his native Montana, his opponent found an easy target in Blewett’s unusual profile. At the time, he was an ambitious, well-traveled lawyer with a Harvard degree who still lived in his parents’ basement.
“He accused me of being single, traveling to exotic countries, being an Ivy League graduate, and not owning property,” said Blewett, recalling a flyer that was mailed to thousands of his constituents when he ran for the Montana House of Representatives at the age of 27.
In spite of his opponents’ efforts to derisively brand him as an “Ivy-Leaguer,” Blewett said that his Harvard credentials might have actually helped him establish credibility and, eventually, win the seat.
“When you’re running in Montana as a guy who lives in his parents’ basement, it’s good to point out that you went to school at an accredited university,” said Blewett, who went on to become the youngest state senator in Montana history.
When candidates return to home districts after receiving a Harvard degree, they can convince voters that they are using the skills they acquired for the benefit of local constituents, Blewett said.
“I think a lot of people appreciate the fact that someone would go to Harvard and return to Montana,” he said.
BEHIND THE SCENES
Regardless of whether candidates use their school days as a foil for their current policies or as useful selling points in contentious elections, they almost always benefit both intellectually and materially from the substance of their Harvard education.
One crucial advantage comes during fundraising, when Harvard graduates are able to take advantage of a nation-wide network of well-connected Harvard affiliates.
“People who attended Harvard tend to think of themselves as lifelong alumni,” Payne said. “They will help a brother or sister, a fellow ‘Harvardian.’”
The benefits of a Harvard degree extend beyond election night, as elected officials cull advisers and appointees from an exceptionally talented pool of school friends and acquaintances.
Obama is known to have filled his administration with Ivy League graduates, many of whom attended Harvard. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew ’78, Education Secretary Arne S. Duncan ’86, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun L. Donovan ’87, and Chair of the Council of Economic Advisors Alan B. Krueger all hold Harvard degrees.
In 2010, Obama appointed Laurence H. Tribe ’62, one of his former professors at the Law School, as senior counselor for access to justice in the United States Justice Department.
Other legislators said that a Harvard education, especially at the graduate school level, helped make them better-informed lawmakers.
U.S. Representative Stephen F. Lynch, who attended the John F. Kennedy School of Government in 1999 while still a state senator, is one of these legislators.
“[After the Kennedy School], I think I was probably as well-versed on foreign policy issues as I am now, but now I do it as a full-time job, and I’m on a foreign policy sub-committee [in the House],” Lynch told The Crimson in an April interview.
Less than two years after graduating, Lynch won a special election and, with it, the job of representing the ninth district on Capitol Hill.
Such an experience is not uncommon, especially at the Kennedy School. U.S. Representative James R. Langevin, currently a Rhode Island congressman, was a state representative when he enrolled at the Kennedy School in 1993.
“I was looking to become a better legislator, and to become more adept at making public policy,” he said in 2012. Langevin’s time at the Kennedy School helped prepare him to serve as a federal legislator representing Rhode Island’s second district, he said.
Dershowitz argued that even Cruz has profited from his time at the Law School—where the senator edited the Harvard Law Review, and graduated magna cum laude.
“I was very tough on him because he was very smart,” said Dershowitz, adding that some of Cruz’s litigation skills bear the hallmarks of a Law School education. “If you’re a conservative at Harvard, I want you to leave a smarter conservative.”
Though he will likely never publicly associate with Dershowitz’s legal views, Cruz will forever remain a Harvard graduate.
“We don’t disclaim our students even if we disagree with them,” Dershowitz said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a cold, rainy Friday in December 2009, University President Drew G. Faust left Harvard Yard for an important meeting about Harvard’s Allston development plans. While the subject of the meeting was not unique, the meeting’s location was. Faust headed to 102 Chesterfield Street, a humble, 1,700 square foot home in Boston’s Hyde Park neighborhood, to meet Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino not at City Hall or Parkman House, the city’s official mayorial residence, but in his private home.
The house call—hardly the standard for University-city relations—was emblematic of a relationship that, despite rocky beginnings in the early 1990s, has become more positive and productive under the leadership of Faust and former University President Lawrence H. Summers.
In January 2014 Menino will step down from the Boston mayorship, a post he has held since 1993. The city’s longest-serving mayor, Menino has collaborated with Harvard through four serving presidents, land purchases in Allston, and the rise of online education. The relationship is an important one for both parties: for Harvard in its development aspirations, and for Boston in enhancing the City’s educational programming, both in public schools and online.
‘ARROGANCE’
When Menino was elected mayor from his prior post of City Councillor in 1993, Harvard was discreetly preparing to make a major expansion across the Charles River. In a program launched by past University President Derek C. Bok in 1988, Harvard was stealthily buying up parcels of the Allston-Brighton neighborhood near Harvard Business School and the University’s athletic facilities. To avoid restrictions on large sales of land, the University worked through a Boston real estate firm, conducting the purchases in 14 separate installments. The last transaction came in 1994, only a few months after Menino was elected.
After concealing the purchases for years, Harvard announced in June 1997 that the University had successfully acquired 52.6 acres of land in Allston and was looking to begin the process of developing those holdings. That month, at an emotionally charged meeting in Allston, residents took Harvard to task for the land grab. One Allston resident asked if Harvard had a conscience, while another accused the University of operating secretly and then doing “ex post facto damage control.”
“I think everybody [knew] that Harvard’s first priority [was] Harvard,” said Warren E. Tolman, a state senator who represented Allston in 1997. “People in the neighborhood had their own long-term plans for their little plot of land, and they wanted to know what was going to happen...There were a lot of people who were upset.”
The fervor spread quickly. Menino remembers being emphatic during a press tour, claiming that Harvard should have worked with the city instead of buying the land covertly.
“I did a press event in front of an auto-body shop [in Allston],” Menino recalled in an interview with The Crimson. “I said, ‘Harvard will not take our property without being involved with the city.’”
In a letter to then-University President Neil L. Rudenstine, who had replaced Bok in 1991, Menino took an even sharper tone, writing that Harvard’s actions represented “the highest level of arrogance seen in our city in many years.”
The partnership between the mayor and the University had been compromised.
REPAIRING A DAMAGED RELATIONSHIP
Harvard’s expansion efforts came at the expense of the mayor’s trust.
Soon after the secret purchases were announced in June 1997, Rudenstine launched a damage-control operation. But despite a gift of land for the construction of the Allston-Brighton Library, and a $10 million pledge to help fund low-cost housing loans in Boston and Cambridge, the bad feelings lingered. When Rudenstine left the Harvard presidency in 2001, the relationship was destroyed.
“There was no relationship at that time,” said Menino of the final years of Rudenstine’s tenure. “Harvard thought that they were it, that they didn’t have to worry about anybody else but themselves, but then they ran into all kinds of issues.”
Reached through an assistant, Rudenstine declined to comment for this article.
Chief among the issues complicating Harvard’s relationship with the Mayor was the reality that, without his blessing, Harvard’s ability to develop meaningfully in Allston was severely, if not completely, compromised. Specifically, Harvard could not proceed with any building plans without first obtaining occupancy permits from the city, a process heavily influenced by the Mayor.
The stalled relationship underwent a healthy reboot in 2001 when Summers replaced Rudenstine in Massachusetts Hall. While Rudenstine had spent his entire career in the academy, Summers had been involved in politics, serving as President Bill Clinton’s Treasury Secretary prior to assuming the Harvard presidency. Within a day of his appointment, Summers visited Menino, bringing a more cooperative tone to discussions between Boston and Harvard.
“Because the property he was buying was in the city of Boston, [Larry Summers] had to be sure there was a relationship,” said Menino. “He started right off on the right foot by meeting with us, talking about his plans and how we wanted to work together.”
After their first conference, a friendship quickly developed. Summers and Menino agreed that Harvard and Boston held a number of mutual interests, including a desire for an open dialogue about Allston and improved educational innovation and access. They also pledged to communicate frequently and transparently.
“The Mayor and I kind of agreed that we weren’t going to surprise each other, that if something interesting was going to be in the Boston Globe, we’d let each other know beforehand,” said Summers.
Menino said he believes openness was critical to the relationship’s success. “The thing is, if you communicate with each other, those problems will not be as big a problem as people assume,” he said.
Conversations between Summers and the city, especially regarding Allston, were not without conflict: Harvard returned to the real estate market in 2003, winning a public auction for 91 more acres in Allston. According to Menino, he was not consulted along the way. Still, the dynamic had improved. In 2003, Summers—after consulting with Menino throughout the process—announced the University’s plans for Allston, including a massive new science facility and the relocation of Harvard’s schools of Education and of Public Health.
“You have a new president who inherits the situation, but it allowed everybody to sort of start again,” said David Luberoff, senior project advisor to the Radcliffe Institute’s Boston Area Research Initiative. “That turned out to be a really important turning point in the relationship.”
While Summers is known for his grand vision for Allston, he also set in motion another natural partnership between Harvard and the city in the realm of education—an area that Menino has prioritized throughout his mayorship. In 2002, Harvard and Boston joined forces to revamp after-school programs in Boston’s neighborhoods by awarding $400,000 in grants through the Harvard After School Initiative, an early step in a growing collaboration between Harvard and Boston on education.
UNDER FAUST, GOOD FEELINGS
As the University searched for a leader to replace Summers, Menino was left uncertain.
“When there is a transition of administrations, you never know what the new administrator is going to do,” he said. “We didn’t know how it was going to end up.”
He was reassured in February of 2006 when he met Faust, Harvard’s new president-elect, for breakfast at Parkman House in Boston. Taking a cue from Summers, Faust made an immediate effort to build Harvard’s relationship with Boston at the onset of her presidency.
“I think one of the important parts of having a strong relationship with the city is making sure you build it, and so it was very important for me when I was named President to get to know the Mayor and to build a base of trust,” Faust said.
Throughout Faust’s tenure, the educational partnership between Harvard and the city of Boston has remained strong. In 2008, the Harvard Allston Education Portal opened in Allston to provide mentors—often Harvard undergraduates—and after-school programming to any neighborhood resident who signs up for a free membership.
Both Faust and Menino have underscored the success of the Ed Portal.
“Let me just tell you, the portal is very important because it educates the children of Boston, it gives them a good start, good after school programs,” Menino said. “If you track those kids, they do much better in school than other kids have.”
More recently, the Mayor announced the creation of BostonX, a program which will bring a modified version of Harvard and MIT’s edX platform to Boston community centers.
END OF AN ERA
When Menino leaves office in early 2014, the departure will mark the end of an era, not only for Boston, but for Harvard. As Harvard prepares to restart major construction in Allston, it will need to rely on a strong relationship with City Hall to ensure efficiency and approval of its plans.
Similarly, a strong relationship will enable the city to benefit from continued collaboration with Harvard in the areas of online education and afterschool programming. This is an area of interest Harvard will likely share with the new mayor, as the large majority of candidates looking to replace Menino are emphasizing education in their platforms.
Still, there are elements of uncertainty. Menino has encouraged the development of colleges, universities, and hospitals in the Boston area, commonly referred to as “meds and eds.” But observers say that his successor may not be of the same mind.
“If I were a senior administrator at Harvard, I would be rooting for an alumnus,” said M. Marty Linsky, a Massachusetts political veteran. Linsky, a Kennedy School lecturer, added that Harvard should be worried about a candidate whose policies might be hostile to major institutions.
Whoever emerges as the next mayor, Menino hopes said his replacement takes the importance of higher education into account.
“The brain power they give us is so important,” Menino said of Harvard and the colleges and universities in the greater Boston area. “The next mayor, whoever he or she may be, has to understand that. You can’t be in...conflict with the colleges. You have to work with them.”
Faust said she agrees that maintaining a strong partnership between the University and the city will be pivotal for both entities in the years ahead. She cited Allston development, activities in Longwood, and engagement in the Boston Public Schools as a few examples of sites of future collaboration.
“The city is so important to us, and we hope we’re so important to the city,” she said in April, shortly after Menino announced he would step down.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When students in Ursula Lindqvist’s first-year Swedish class introduced themselves by name and concentration to classroom guests last semester, she was shocked to hear what many of her students were studying.
“I was really surprised to hear student after student after student say ‘Economics,’” said Lindqvist, who will leave her position as Director of Undergraduate Studies for Scandinavian to teach at a small liberal arts college next fall. “I’ve been reading the journals that they’ve been writing...and it was really startling to realize that so many of them are leaning toward Econ. And there’s nothing wrong with Econ, but let’s face it—it’s the huge fall-back concentration, it’s the safe one.”
Lindqvist acknowledged that many students are genuinely interested in economics. But she also raised a concern expressed by students and faculty members alike: as uncertainty persists in the job market, undergraduates seem to feel pressure to choose “practical” fields of study that are thought to increase employment opportunities after college.
But future “success” may not correlate with present happiness. Senior exit surveys over the last three years have consistently shown that humanities concentrations have the highest satisfaction levels when compared to the natural sciences, social sciences, and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
As enrollment in the humanities has fallen, from 321 senior concentrators in 2010 to 284 in 2012, faculty and students are looking to counter what has proven to be a global shift away from the humanities.
A GLOBAL PARADIGM SHIFT
In late April of this year, director of the Mahindra Humanities Center Homi K. Bhabha declared a global “crisis” for the study of humanities. Speaking at “The Humanities and the Future of the University,” a panel convened to discuss the uncertain future of humanistic scholarship, Bhabha highlighted a telling statistic: the amount of money dedicated to humanities research totaled less than half of one percent of the amount dedicated to science and engineering research and development in 2011.
According to national data that chair of the English department W. James Simpson said will be compiled into a report on the humanities to be published this month, the number of bachelor degrees earned in the humanities has declined from 14 to eight percent between 1966 and 2010.
As society increases focus on science and technology, many arts and humanities affiliates frame these statistics within a broader paradigm shift.
Diana Sorensen, divisional dean of the arts and humanities at Harvard, acknowledged that the rise of science has promised societal improvements but added that abandoning the humanities could be dangerous.
“As fast as that pace [of scientific research] has been, we feel that it hasn’t taken stock of the depth of humanistic reflection that would really inform that pace,” she said. “If you’re just hurtling yourself toward the future, you’re more likely to repeat mistakes.”
WITHIN THE GATES
Harvard is not immune to the global trend, but professors are rethinking its causes.
“Up to about a year ago, there were three major reasons for declining concentrator numbers in the humanities. They were: admissions were geared toward scientists, that [the problem] is Harvard-specific, and that it’s to do with financial aid,” said Simpson. “We now know, a year on, that not one of those arguments withstands scrutiny.”
According to Simpson, students pick their concentrations based on intellectual curiosity and a desire to contribute positively to society—goals that students seem to think non-humanities concentrations will fulfill more effectively.
That perception, many suggest, may be driven not by a lack of interest in humanities but rather post-graduate employment pressures. Eighteen percent of students entering Harvard indicate an intention to study the humanities, Simpson said, but more than half of those end up in the social sciences instead.
“A lot of the kids I’ve taken Ec with do it because they like it, but I also think there are some people who think that, because they do Ec at Harvard, they’ll have a better chance of getting a job,” said Jimmy C. Field ’14, an economics concentrator who chose his plan of study based on his interest in math and finance.
Celena C. Tyler ’14, now a literature concentrator, originally wanted to pursue economics. “That’s just what everyone kind of did,” she said. “I wasn’t really sure what I wanted, and everyone said, ‘Oh, you’ll be successful if you do this.’”
Though some students feel that the University provides equal support to all fields of study, others think a disparity in the resources and funding allotted to divisions further embodies the shift away from the humanities.
“The dearth of research opportunities advertised for the humanities is shameful,” wrote Katya Johns ’14-’15, a dual concentrator in English and government and a Crimson arts editor, in an email. “It is up to the individual humanities student to find a mentor to shadow. There are very few pretexts under which to pursue your own individual passions and projects.”
Faculty echoed the call for Harvard to reinvest in the humanities.
“I think of President Faust as a humanist herself,” said Sorensen. “But I do think, on the other hand, that there has been a shift in interest, both here and in society at large.”
REPACKAGING
When Lindqvist started teaching first-year Swedish in the fall of 2009, three students enrolled in the class. After the department increased its web presence, started an email list, and created interdisciplinary courses, 22 students enrolled in the same course last fall.
“As soon as we started reaching out, there was a ready audience there, said Lindqvist. “There was a pre-existing interest. As soon as they found out we had something, they started coming.”
Simpson agreed that the humanities have the right message but should think carefully about whether it is accessible to the modern student.
“Maybe the social sciences are offering answers to the questions that students really want answered about their world,” he said. “[The humanities] needn’t take back on any of our commitments to disciplinary rigor, but we might want to think about designing courses, giving titles, packaging our material, in ways that are recognizable...to the world.
The arts and humanities division is creating new courses that focus on both interdisciplinary interactions and big questions about violence, war, and the meaning of life, according to Sorensen. Additionally, the division hopes to create a collaborative space, perhaps modeled in part on the Institute of Politics, for undergraduates of all disciplines to gather and discuss humanistic issues. SHARP, a new summer research program in the arts and humanities, will also launch next month.
“We need to show our audience, our students, that these four years are part of your pre-professional training, but in a way that’s not immediately connected to the concentration you will pick,” said Sorensen. “We’re trying to imagine that the education we are giving you will make you fabulous 21st century citizens with everything you’ll be asked to do, but without stripping you of your humanity.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the fate of automatic, deficit-reducing budget cuts lay in the hands of a polarized Congress earlier this year, political pundits and academic authorities forecast a gloomy future for research powerhouses like Harvard, where investigators rely heavily on federal funding.
Yet since sequestration—the across-the-board cuts aimed at slashing a total of $1.2 trillion from the federal budget over the next decade—took effect in March, researchers have not experienced the widespread, immediate reductions to funding that had been predicted so widely as a result of the cuts.
Three months later, the outlook for research varies from lab to lab. Nonetheless, most researchers and administrators at Harvard agree that when the cuts do trickle down, younger, incoming researchers will disproportionately suffer, hindering the development of a new generation of researchers and, ultimately, stalling long-term advances.
“There’s no question that if the cuts get deeper, they will affect almost everyone,” said University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76. “It will be a real loss for the country and for the world when our talented students abandon science and other research-intensive fields because the funding climate is too uncertain.”
TRICKLING IN
The staggered, disparate implementation of agency budget cuts, combined with cost-cutting measures devised by researchers and administrators, has softened the immediate blow of sequestration.
“The effects are sort of trickling in rather than coming in a giant wave,” said Eric M. Asetta, assistant director for research administration at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. The impact of the cuts on grant award rates and funding levels, Asetta predicted, may gradually “trend downward” and create “a new norm.”
Moreover, because the budget cuts are in early stages, the overall impact of sequestration in the immediate future remains difficult to gauge, wrote Elizabeth A. Lennox, assistant dean for research administration at the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, in an email.
As a whole, federal sources provided Harvard with $650 million in the fiscal year 2012, but those funds were not distributed evenly. Investigators at schools like SEAS, the Medical School, the School of Public Health, and FAS rely more on funding from Washington than their colleagues at the University’s other schools.
For now, the experiences of these researchers reveal few clear patterns, with some labs grappling with drastic losses in funding and others handling more manageable reductions in supplies and staff size. This variation is in part a result of the different ways in which federal agencies responded to sequestration when it officially struck Washington in early March.
The National Science Foundation, for instance, opted to award about 1,000 fewer grants in the remainder of the fiscal year 2013, while the National Institutes of Health implemented a five percent budget reduction by slashing the number and size of grant awards. Defense agencies, which must trim spending by about eight percent, have cut back on grants for new scientists and dropped certain projects.
As a result of these measures, researchers are facing circumstances ranging from a sudden drop in the grant size or a complete loss of funding to no funding change at all.
Certain fields of research are also more likely to be affected by funding cuts as agencies make careful calculations about which types of research they want to fund. Many scientists agree that health-related fields are likely to continue to be well funded, but there is little consensus on the fate of less practical research areas.
“Some fields are being targeted and you hear congressmen talking about only funding research that will directly lead to cures for diseases,” Garber said. This targeting, he added, is one reason that “people are experiencing sequestration—and the budgetary pressures more generally—in very different ways.”
NOT A NEW PROBLEM
In response to federal cuts, researchers have developed strategies to tighten their budgets and secure funding from other sources, further mitigating the immediate impact of sequestration.
Since researchers had already faced years of stagnant federal funding, many investigators had grown accustomed to cutting costs by tightening lab supply budgets and reducing staff size.
In addition, Asetta and Lennox, who help scientists administer research projects in SEAS and FAS, respectively, said that they have increased focus on training investigators so they can be more successful in the grant selection process.
“It’s always been tough to get money,” said physics professor David A. Weitz, adding that high demand for federal grants and the termination of existing scientific investigations are not new problems facing researchers.
Sequestration, and the tightened funding landscape that has followed, has also further fueled researchers’ pursuit of funds from private companies, philanthropic institutions, and foundations.
David Jacobson, a communications strategist for Moody’s Investors Service, wrote in an email that research-based universities such as Harvard—unlike stand-alone research institutes—are funded by a diverse group of sources and have a more flexible set of expenses. Accordingly, Harvard and its counterparts “should be able to contain costs and seek new revenue opportunities to offset federal funding cuts,” Jacobson wrote. Corporate grants and revenues from gifts are potential alternative funding sources, according to Jacobson.
“You have to look beyond the traditional sources,” Weitz said. “If money is green, you should spend it.”
A TWO-FOLD PROBLEM
While the prospects for scientists in the short-term remain unclear, many researchers and administrators share the opinion that tougher financial circumstances could deter budding researchers, thus diminishing prospects for the future of scientific research. Experienced researchers possess the reputation and knowledge to secure funding from a diverse set of sources, but many young prospective scientists may need to rely on federal funding to launch their careers.
“An established researcher might be able to cope with the cuts better than someone who is just entering the field,” said Constantine Vardavas, senior research scientist at the School of Public Health.
The problem, Vardavas explained, is two-fold: young researchers may struggle to attain funding from federal agencies or non-federal institutions, and senior lab leaders may lack the money to hire them.
As a result, sequestration acts as “a self-inflicted wound” on the nation’s “intellectual and human capital,” as described by University President Drew G. Faust.
Moreover, because of the uncertainty surrounding the exact implementation of federal cuts, it is difficult to properly budget for staff additions, which present the largest and most significant costs for labs, according to David D. Cox ’00, an assistant biology and computer science professor. Given bleaker funding prospects, Cox has only made a few hires, often selecting foreign post-doctoral students who receive funding from their countries’ governments.
“We never dreamed that it would get this tight,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the end of reading period, nearly 40 undergraduates in red onesie pajamas assembled at a themed party to celebrate senior members of the group. The fete—“Pyrites of the Caribbean: At Semester’s End,” a geological play on the Disney movie franchise—was not an extracurricular event but rather the final meeting of the Geological Society, a club formed by concentrators in the earth and planetary sciences.
With just about 40 students, EPS is one of the College’s smaller concentrations and prides itself on its active community, said “Geo Society Empress” Alex S. Morgan ’14. But its approach to camaraderie is just one of many possible routes. From student-faculty dinners to common physical spaces to group problem solving sessions, each of Harvard’s 48 undergraduate concentrations has its own strategies to build community around shared academic interests.
Still, some students feel more affinity with fellow concentrators than others. And on a campus that is brimming with extracurriculars, social organizations, and the residential House system, concentration community is just one element of the student experience. While Harvard is known for its academics, factors such as concentration size, assignment type, and student and faculty initiative seem to have a large impact on whether a student feels a social connection to his or her concentration.
SIZING IT UP
Although concentration size does not necessarily correlate with concentration satisfaction—in 2012 senior exit surveys, small concentrations had both the highest and lowest ratings—students in smaller concentrations said they tend to be closer because they interact more often.
“You get to interact and work with a lot of the same kids and that definitely fosters relationships,” said Nicholas W. Galat ’13, one of just under 100 concentrators in statistics.
“I guess I feel like the department doesn’t actually do a ton, but I think it’s nice because it’s such a small department that you get to know the people really well,” said William D. Horton ’15, a music concentrator.
Music, with only 19 concentrators, had the lowest concentration satisfaction in 2012 surveys.
Conversely, for students in larger concentrations, their academic field tended to play a smaller role in their daily experience.
“Because Psychology is one of the larger concentrations, it can be challenging to create a more intimate community,” said Melissa A. Yetman, an undergraduate program coordinator in psychology. While the department holds several events, including Sophomore Welcome gatherings and student-faculty dinners, Yetman said they are not always well-attended because coordinating the schedules of so many students can be challenging.
Kevin L. Huang ’13, who concentrated in government and statistics, served as a government peer concentration counselor as part of the department’s efforts to improve advising. But given the varied specialties of concentrators and the vast size of the concentration, he said it was almost impossible to get to know many of his fellow concentrators.
“There are just too many people in the department, to the point where you inevitably end up with people who just don’t know each other,” Huang said.
FORMULAS FOR COMMUNITY
Still, sometimes even larger concentrations are able to develop a tight-knit community thanks to the nature of assignments—problem sets, group projects, and laboratory or research settings often bring students together.
Physics, for example, has a number of traditional events, from a weekly problem set solving night in Leverett Dining Hall that sees students scribbling solutions until late in the night to an annual picnic. The Harvard-Radcliffe Society of Physics Students serves as a network for students of physics from inside and outside the concentration.
“It’s interesting working with [classmates] on harder physics problems so you know how they think and how they tackle problems,” said Farzan Vafa ’15, a physics and math concentrator.
When he was a sophomore, human developmental and regenerative biology concentrator Theodore A. Peng ’13 and some of his peers formed an email group, the HDRB Study Buddies, to discuss the assigned problem sets in their tutorial. The email list quickly grew into more than just a study group, and this year, some of the Study Buddies as well as other HDRB concentrators coordinated seeing the midnight premiere of The Hunger Games together.
“Having p-sets has definitely contributed to us getting to know each other,” Peng said.
While science and other quantitative concentrators are vocal about the strength of their communities, HDRB professor and Eliot House Master Douglas A. Melton said that it is not just classes with problem sets that can bring students together.
“Almost all subjects must have some sort of projects, be they p-sets or outings or work projects,” Melton said. “If learning occurs better in a group environment, then we should try more ways of doing that.”
History and Literature exemplifies this model with one mandatory, concentration-wide book assigned each semester. Because the concentration is split into specialty regions, such as modern Europe and Latin America, the assignment lets concentrators engage with students of other geographical and historical areas whose paths might not otherwise cross. In the new sophomore tutorials for History of Science, students often work in groups and present to one another.
In Romance Languages and Literatures, students choose a language as the centerpiece of their curriculum, and concentrators said they feel less camaraderie because each student studies a different language and begins at a different level.
“There’s kind of a different bond since a lot more people who do those concentrations travel, and then they can compare study abroad stories,” said Erik T. Olsen ’15, who focuses in Italian.
COMMUNITY CONVERSATIONS
Not every student looks to his or her concentration as a primary community. Some even find little need to branch out from their House communities.
“You have a very deep connection to your House, which takes away from something, and one of those things is your connection to your concentration,” said Mahzarin R. Banaji,a professor of social psychology.
While House community has become a staple of the undergraduate experience, department heads are still trying to develop academic community without treading on the extracurricular commitments and social lives of students.
“We want to strike the right balance between providing events or activities that students are excited about and want to attend and not organizing too many events where students feel spread too thin to attend or feel that they will not gain anything from them,” Yetman said of community-building efforts in psychology.
In some cases, professors find that capitalizing on the strength of the House system can actually enhance concentration-specific activities.
“[Physics Night] grew up by accident 14 years ago because I started teaching Physics 16 at the same time I became Leverett House Master and at the same time that our dining hall opened up 24 hours a day,” said Leverett House Master, Physics professor, and Director of Undergraduate Studies for Physics and ‘Chemistry and Physics’ Howard M. Georgi ’68 in an email to The Crimson. “The combination was magical.”
Melton said he envisions spreading the model established by Georgi to more houses and fields, and led his own evening sessions on biotechnology in Eliot last year.
“Almost any job or activity you have will involve working as part of a team or as part of a community,” Melton said of the importance of developing camaraderie. “The more we can prepare people to think about that—how they interact with other members, bosses, subordinates, equals—the better off we are.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the spring of 2008, 15 undergraduates presented their final project for Engineering Sciences 96: “Engineering Problem Solving and Design Project” on “Bridging the Gap: Connecting Harvard’s Allston and Cambridge Communities.” The topic was particularly relevant at the time, with planning for the Allston Science Complex well under way, but it would lose valence just a few months later, when the financial crisis pummeled Harvard’s endowment and halted all construction indefinitely.
Now the report is newly salient: this February, University President Drew G. Faust announced that the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences will almost entirely relocate to Allston as development across the river resumes. The move, whose announcement was called the “Allston bomb” by one faculty member because of its abrupt timing, has nonetheless been heralded as an opportunity for much-needed expansion as SEAS continues to see its concentration numbers—and the external demand for engineers—balloon.
Still, the move will physically distance the engineering school from the undergraduate heart of Harvard’s Cambridge campus. And though facilities in Allston will not be ready until at least 2017-18, faculty members and students alike have already begun expressing concern regarding SEAS’ ability to remain integrated in a liberal arts education from its future home across the river.
SEAS AT HIGH TIDE
With a recent upswing in professional positions that prize engineering skills, the growth of SEAS has been catalyzed by a global interest in engineering and the applied sciences. Data collected by the National Science Foundation in 2010, for example, suggests that individuals with advanced degrees in engineering have higher employment rates.
“In recent years, there has been a greater emphasis on STEM [science, technology, engineering and math] subjects in the K-12 system, and more high-achieving college-bound students see engineering and applied sciences as viable and desirable career paths,” wrote SEAS Dean Cherry A. Murray in an email to The Crimson.
For many Harvard undergraduates, interest in engineering has pivoted around the field of computer science, which students see as a stepping stone to both startup work and conventional programming careers.
Having nearly doubled in size over the last two years, computer science is Harvard’s fastest-growing concentration. Its reach has stretched beyond the traditional engineer in large part because of Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science,” which has expanded under lecturer David J. Malan ’99 to enroll more undergraduates than any class except Economics 10: “Principles of Economics.”
“I think there’s a new entrepreneurial spirit amongst the students,” said J. Gregory Morrisett, a computer science professor. “They’ve seen the success of things like Facebook and realize they could do it too.”
In addition, professors said that an increasing demand for technological gadgets and medical devices may necessitate a generation of Americans capable of domestic engineering production. Engineering Sciences 50: “Introduction to Electrical Engineering,” the electric and mechanical engineering equivalent of CS50, has grown from 19 to 164 students in just five years, and the overall number of concentrators in SEAS has increased from 291 to 678 since the school was founded in 2007.
“We’re trying to show students and get them excited not just about writing programs, but also playing with the hardware, building things, electrical devices,” said electrical engineering professor Marko Loncar.
Professional opportunities have not only increased the appeal of SEAS but also generated new possibilities for entrepreneurship through collaboration with the Graduate School of Design and Harvard Business School.
“We’re trying to design even more classes along these boundaries and make additional bridges with disciplines not traditionally connected to engineering,” explained Loncar.
INTERNAL INNOVATION
As the global desire for engineering skills and tools has bolstered interest in the field, SEAS has promoted its own growth through internal efforts such as the restructuring of introductory classes, the implementation of innovative teaching methods, and an emphasis on hands-on design.
Murray has echoed the importance of integration between engineering and the liberal arts and has repeatedly stated her objective that “all graduates, whatever their field, leave [Harvard] with a well-developed literacy in technology.”
Morrisett, who teaches Computer Science 51: “Introduction to Computer Science II,” said that the broad appeal of these courses attracts a community of students who might not intuitively consider themselves engineers.
“In CS50 and CS51, we try to draw on domains that aren’t just for nerds; 51 has problem sets that deal with music or 50 has problem sets that deal with photography and imagery,” Morrisett said. “Once you have a good cohort of students that aren’t just engineers, it becomes a lot easier for students to team up and take those kinds of classes together.”
Thanks to its rapid growth and industrial connections, SEAS has continued to receive generous funding despite the economic decline and funding cuts to research across the nation.
“There’s a big pool of money that’s partly driving the expansion of the faculty,” said David D. Cox ’00, an associate professor in molecular and cellular biology and computer science, explaining that this support is not as reliable in other parts of the University.
In addition to planning new facilities in Allston, Loncar said the University has accommodated alternative formats of learning and teaching through expanded budgets for classroom ventures. In Loncar’s class ES50, for example, each student group received around $100 to build a final project.
“When we actually introduced the final project component where students build hardware and design cool stuff instead of the final exam, enrollment skyrocketed,” Loncar said.
BUILDING BRIDGES
When archaeologists embarked on a mission to save the Dead Sea Scrolls—a collection of 2,000-year-old documents that contain the earliest known copies of the Hebrew Bible—they enlisted SEAS’ help. A room full of computer scientists and engineers discussed ways to determine rates of decay while historians worried whether the documents could survive another two millennia of natural decline.
This interdisciplinary partnership, orchestrated by the Harvard Initiative for the Science of the Human Past, is part of the newly emerging field of digital humanities.
“[The project] just evinces this sort of breadth of reach of engineering and computer science into just about everything,” said Cox, who was among the SEAS faculty consulted for the initiative.
Engineering tools can shape the way humanities are studied, but the study of engineering itself also overlaps substantively with a wide range of fields. Administrators said that SEAS especially hopes to capitalize on these connections by integrating an engineering mindset into other divisions on campus.
“Atmospheric research will continue to intersect with earth science; bioengineering will always learn from OEB and genetics; data privacy crosses over with the social sciences and law; and applied mathematics frequently lends insights to economics,” wrote Murray. “The reality is that across Harvard, we all benefit from our strengths in diverse fields.”
Executive Dean for Education and Research Fawwaz Habbal confirmed that the SEAS mission is inextricable from Harvard’s broader commitment to providing students with a strong liberal arts foundation.
“We don’t feel that our mission will be fulfilled without liberal arts. We have no intention to become a mini-MIT, a mini-Georgia Tech,” he said. “We are inside Harvard for a function.”
ALLOPATRIC SPECIATION
Some professors fear, however, that a geographical separation between SEAS in Allston and the rest of the FAS in Cambridge could hinder important elements of SEAS’ mission—widening the scope of engineering to non-concentrators and producing engineers who understand the humanistic context of their work.
The distance could, some professors argue, sever student interaction and strain professors with joint appointments, who would have to meet teaching and research obligations in both locations.
SEAS professors and classes are currently housed across eight buildings, all located on the north end of the Cambridge campus. Current physical separations do not obstruct collaboration, Habbal said, adding that he is confident that the move to Allston will allow for the    creation of common spaces that encourage faculty bonds and “provide a green field for new ideas.”
“We are not living under one roof but we found a way to create a connection,” Habbal said.
Proponents of the move highlight not only SEAS’ desperate need for more space but also the proximity of the Harvard Innovation Lab and the Business School in Allston as assets that will foster an entrepreneurial culture and new spaces for creative programming.
Still, whether the advantages outweigh the physical effects of distance is a “non-stop topic of conversation” for SEAS faculty, according to Cox.
“I know the Business School is excited about having SEAS next door because of the obvious entrepreneurial connections,” he said. “I’m not sure that the SEAS faculty is outrageously excited about that necessarily when balanced with all the collaborations that will be harder to have on the main campus.”
Students, too, have expressed reservations about the effects of the impending move on their academic experience.
“The biggest question will not be how easy it is for students to move back and forth to Allston, but how easy it is for ideas to move from SEAS to the main campus,” said Neel S. Patel ’16, a prospective engineering concentrator.
On its online fact page, SEAS specifically highlights its proximity to five FAS departments. For a school that prides itself on its connections with neighboring disciplines, the loss of those neighbors could have long-term implications for its interdisciplinary focus.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Each Tuesday afternoon this past academic year, Harvard students had an opportunity they had never had before—the chance to attend office hours with the College’s first permanent director of bisexual, gay, lesbian, transgender, and queer student life.
Since beginning work as the head of the fledgling Office of BGLTQ Student Life last July, Vanidy “Van” Bailey has filled the first administrative position representing the BGLTQ community at Harvard. In this role, Bailey has embarked on a campaign to raise awareness of centralized resources and to create a warm and accepting environment for students on campus.
“I’m just wildly passionate about fostering supportive community that represents the diversity of the BGLTQ community,” Bailey said in an interview in the Office last week. “I’m here to make sure that people can see themselves in this Office regardless of their gender or sexual orientation.”
Community members say without hesitation that Bailey’s first year on the job has been a successful one. Still, they say, problems remain for the BGLTQ community at Harvard. As they push for the expansion of gender neutral spaces and greater resources for the full BGLTQ spectrum, they say Bailey’s progress in community building must be accompanied by administrative policy changes before BGLTQ life on campus can truly thrive.
TAKING THE HELM
Bailey’s new position has been in the works for several years. Soon after a working group released a report in spring 2011 recommending changes to address the undergraduate BGLTQ community’s needs, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds announced plans to create a new office to support BGLTQ life and to hire a full-time director to oversee it.
After the first director picked to lead the Office abruptly turned down the job just days before she was scheduled to begin in fall 2011, administrators were forced to begin the search for a director anew. They chose Bailey, a young assistant director for education at the University of California, San Diego, to lead the new office. Bailey, who has a doctorate in education leadership from California State University—Northridge, had worked in student affairs at various colleges and universities since 2005.
Bailey said that with this background, the position at Harvard was a natural fit.
“I just have such a huge love for LBGT work in general,” Bailey said. “When I first started thinking about what was next for me...I knew that I wanted to be the leader of some kind of identity-based center.”
In an increasingly diverse BGLTQ community at Harvard, students say they think Bailey’s selection is especially significant given the new director’s ethnic and gender identity.
“The fact that the BGLTQ Office is headed not only by a transgender person, but also a person of color, is kind of revolutionary...it’s kind of unheard of,” said Riley, a rising sophomore who requested a pseudonym because his parents do not know that he is transgender. “I think it symbolically adds to conversations about intersectionality.”
BUILDING A COMMUNITY
Much of Bailey’s work in his first year on the job has been aimed at forging connections with constituencies across campus.
To this end, Bailey has devoted substantial time in his first months at Harvard to networking, and he has held at least two to three meetings per week, he estimates. In formal sit-downs and casual conversations, he has spoken with student organizations ranging from the Undergraduate Council to the Hindu student group Dharma, and talked with faculty members on the Committee on Degrees in Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies. He also extended his outreach to administrators at University Health Services, the Office of International Education, and the Office of the Assistant to the President for Institutional Diversity and Equity, among others.
Queer Students and Allies Co-Chair Ivel Posada ’14 said that even though Bailey was new to the job this year, he quickly established himself as a helpful resource.
“He’s had to move around in the dark a little bit and see exactly what it is he has to do,” Posada said. “He’s been very good at making sure to email us and let us know that the Office can help.”
Posada also credited Bailey for fostering community dialogue after history professor Niall Ferguson made controversial comments suggesting a connection between economist John Maynard Keynes’s sexuality and his economic theory. As Ferguson’s remarks garnered international attention, Bailey was quick to respond within the Harvard community, looping in various student organizations to an email discussion about the controversy and helping to organize a lunch conversation with Ferguson at the Harvard College Women’s Center.
Bailey has also sought to build community within the Office itself, which is nestled in the basement of Boylston Hall between colorful yellow walls. Along with office hours, Bailey has led the Office’s first ever class of student interns and hosted a weekly community hour that regularly draws between 15 and 30 students who meet in the Office to eat and play games.
PUSHING FOR POLICY CHANGE
Bailey’s efforts have earned praise from fellow administrators and students, who say he has made significant strides in his first months at Harvard.
“What I’ve seen and heard is students’ appreciation for his commitment and his advocacy,” Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 said.
However, students in the BGLTQ undergraduate community say that the Office’s recent successes are not enough. For them, more must be done at a policymaking level for some BGLTQ resources to improve.
“I’m reservedly optimistic in the sense that [the Office] establishing itself more definitely adds to visibility and opens the door to discussions that take place, but those discussions need to manifest in policy change,” said Riley, the transgender student. “I want to see obvious results that make a difference on campus.”
One such meaningful change, these students say, would be the introduction of gender neutral housing options for freshmen, a policy that was established in the upperclassman Houses in 2010. Other students complained that many of the resources at Harvard do not focus on bisexual or transgender students as much as they should, instead primarily targeting gay and lesbian community members.
While students acknowledge that Bailey’s progress this past year represents a step in the right direction, they are eager to see further changes.
“The Office of BGLTQ Student Life is very new, and I think it needs a year or two to fully grow and develop, but these issues are important,” wrote Sam, a rising senior in Lowell House, who requested that his name be changed because he did not want his sexuality to be publicly known.
For his part, Bailey said he believes the time is ripe for the BGLTQ community to expand its visibility on campus.
“I’m excited to keep growing, really,” Bailey concluded. “That’s what it’s about at this point, to keep growing.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“The largest intellectual footprint with the smallest physical footprint” has been the mantra directing Harvard’s approach to international strategy in an increasingly global world.
Repeated verbatim by administrators ranging from University President Drew G. Faust to Harvard Business School Dean Nitin Nohria, the assertion that Harvard should foster a global presence without laying down bricks has guided such decisions as the University’s choice not to construct a second campus in another country, as some of its peer institutions have already done.
But while Harvard has avoided building something in the style of Yale-National University of Singapore College, fostering an international presence has remained a priority. In her email to faculty outlining seven principles that will guide the upcoming capital campaign, Faust listed the idea that “[k]nowledge and learning are increasingly global” and international strategy as areas sure to be emphasized when soliciting donations.
Faust has said that edX, the virtual education platform that Harvard launched jointly with MIT about one year ago, will also be included in the campaign’s priorities. With approximately 900,000 unique users, 72 percent of whom are from outside the United States, edX epitomizes the globalization of knowledge.
As Harvard embarks on a capital campaign unprecedented in scope, global priorities might seem to focus on bettering the world—but faculty and administrators say they will ultimately improve research and pedagogy back home at Harvard. To look inward and improve its Cambridge campus, the University has determined that it must first look out, beyond the confines of its physical presence.
ED-X-PLORATION
EdX was always intended to bring college courses, free of charge, to any person with a computer and internet access, but it has become even more global as it has grown.
Over the past year, the platform has rapidly expanded from its Cambridge-based founders to include 27 total institutional partners across four continents. Individuals from nearly 200 countries have registered for edX courses. At Harvard, East Asian Languages and Civilizations professor Peter K. Bol created a new course, Chinese History 185: “Creating ChinaX—Teaching China’s History Online,” devoted to developing modules for ChinaX, a course that will be offered through HarvardX—Harvard’s segment of edX—next fall.
But unlike other online education platforms, edX lists among its goals a commitment to gathering research and information on the ways in which students learn. Those involved in the initiative hope that the data they gather might soon be channeled towards improving pedagogy and learning within the physical classroom.
Only one year in, administrators say it may be too early to see what such research could mean for the bricks and mortar university, but they remain optimistic that any impact will be significant.
“To improve education on our campuses, we have to research. To do this research, we need a lot of data. We are viewing edX as a particle accelerator for learning,” said edX President Anant Agarwal. “We’re all doing research on this big data, which informs us of how students learn and how we can improve student learning on campus.”
In the course he constructed for MITx, Agarwal separated virtual learners into two groups—one that watched lectures in which the professor’s hand was not visible as he wrote, and one that viewed lectures in which it was. Although there was statistically no significant difference between the groups in terms of completion rate or grades, the latter group gave the course and the lectures better overall ratings.
Professors interviewed for this article said that edX’s impact on the classroom will come from more than just its research capabilities.
Robert Lue, chair of the HarvardX Faculty Committee, said HarvardX might be used to fulfill prerequisites, allowing students from many backgrounds to attain the skills necessary to take certain Harvard courses. Professors have also discussed the possibility of integrating HarvardX material into the structure of their Harvard courses.
Computer science lecturer David J. Malan ’99 said that he has already benefited from implementing a virtual version of his popular course Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I.” Translating CS50 into an edX course was the impetus behind the creation of CS50 Check, an auto-grading framework that was used this past year both on Harvard’s campus and in the virtual version of the class, CS50x. CS50 Check allowed edX and Harvard students to judge the correctness of their problem sets before making a final submission.
“We want to make sure that the resources and the structure that connects all of the innovations that are made in HarvardX, the support of those innovations, are adequately supported in a way that both leverages and feeds back into the existing systems here at Harvard,” Lue said.
BRINGING IT BACK HOME
While edX is working to bring Harvard to the world, Harvard affiliates are going abroad and bringing their experiences back home.
Harvard may have avoided creating a second campus outside of Cambridge, but it has put down roots in nine countries globally through its schools and research centers. Harvard Business School alone has constructed, since 1996, centers for research in Argentina, China, France, India, and Japan.
Jorge I. Dominguez, a government professor and Harvard’s vice provost for international affairs, described these research centers as essential in part because of their ability to ensure that Harvard affiliates have a global perspective. These sites, he said, “advance the research of faculty and in a number of instances of students.”
The “Harvard Worldwide” website, launched in 2008, lists a slew of Harvard professors who conduct their research internationally, for example. Graduate School of Education professor Fernando M. Reimers has traveled to Egypt, Morocco, Oman, Dubai, and Abu Dhabi to research programs that educate individuals about entrepreneurial skills like management and teamwork. He brings the findings from his travels back to Harvard, where he teaches an Education School class on entrepreneurial education.
In an email, Reimers praised Harvard’s approach to international initiatives thus far for “invit[ing] all of us in this university, where many global initiatives already exist, to become intentionally global.”
Students are also finding ways to have global experiences. According to Dominguez, half of undergraduates leave the College with significant international experience. Under the Field Immersion Experiences for Leadership Development program, created in 2011, all first-year Business School students must travel to a country with an emerging market. The School of Public Health has partnered with the government of Botswana since 1996, sending Harvard affiliates abroad to research the spread of AIDS in the country.
Those who have traveled internationally generally say they enjoy their experiences and bring a more global perspective back to Harvard’s campus thanks to their travels. Their time abroad aligns with the mission outlined in a letter Faust wrote in the September-October 2012 issue of Harvard Magazine, in which she laid out Harvard’s approach to international issues and its commitment to creating a student body aware of its “global context.”
“Harvard will become more intentionally global in the years to come, uniting and leveraging its extraordinary intellectual and programmatic strengths to ensure that our teaching and research have the optimal potential to make a positive difference,” Faust wrote. “What we do next will have an impact not just on the University’s future, but on the world’s future, a future in which knowledge and education will play an ever more important role.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sirens were blaring, an MIT police officer was dead, and there had been no word from the University for more than an hour. A quarter before two in the morning, Undergraduate Council President Tara Raghuveer ’14 sent a very public email.
The message, addressed to two top College administrators and copied to the approximately 250 members of the UC general list, urged Harvard officials to update the student body on the status of the violence, even if it were no more than “just a word to stay inside and stay calm.”
“Students feel there is no direction,” the email said. “Any updated information would be appreciated.”
This assertive and open pressure on the administration’s emergency response on the night of the manhunt for the Boston Marthon bombing suspects is typical of Raghuveer and UC Vice President Jen Q. Y Zhu ’14’s approach towards student government. It is also typical of how the University responds to that approach.
Although Raghuveer’s email was followed 15 minutes later by another MessageMe update updating the community about the situation in the Greater Boston area, there is no evidence to suggest that Raghuveer’s request influenced Harvard’s decision making. When asked what factors spurred their actions that night, administrators point to accurate information obtained from law enforcement authorities about threats to Harvard. They do not credit the Undergraduate Council.
Former and current UC representatives say that Raghuveer and Zhu are more assertive than their immediate predecessors, but that they are no more effective in convincing administrators to take action. No matter what approach the Council takes to encourage change, these skeptics say, Harvard will continue to act when it wants to and on its own terms.
“We can demand as much relevance as we want, be as assertive as we want, but at the end of the day the administrators make the decisions,” said Sietse K. Goffard ’15, a UC representative from Currier House.
AS THE PENDULUM SWINGS
UC Student Relations Committee Chair James B. Pollack ’14 believes that from one year to the next, UC leaders oscillate between two theories of student governance.
“The UC presidency is kind of like a pendulum in that in a year-to-year basis there are two philosophies with which you can approach being the Undergraduate Council,” Pollack said. “You can approach it as, ‘We don’t have any power so we should work as closely with the administration...because they’re the ones who hold the locks and keys.’ Or there’s the opposite—‘We have the power of organizing students on campus to activate change, to pressure for change, to force the administration to do things that they wouldn’t be comfortable saying yes to.’”
He said that while last year’s UC leaders, former president Danny P. Bicknell ’13 and former vice president Pratyusha Yalamanchi ’13, largely took the former approach, Raghuveer and Zhu have opted for the latter.
Goffard echoed Pollack’s pendulum metaphor.
“We’re swinging back towards...a more forceful [leadership] and not taking no as an answer, essentially,” he said. “I think Tara and Jen embody that kind of leadership.”
For her part, Raghuveer contests the notion that she has “challenged” or been “adversarial” towards the administration. However, she agrees that the Council has been focusing this semester on being responsive and assertive on certain campus-wide issues—particularly after the passage of three student referenda in the November election that put her into office.
“I have spent a lot of time this semester sort of reflecting on what my role should be, and my role should not be to communicate on behalf of the administration to students,” Raghuveer said. “Given the mandate of the election, my role is really to be an advocate for students.”
LIVING THE SLOGAN
Raghuveer and Zhu earned the UC presidency on a platform that sought to “demand relevance.” In their first semester at the helm of the organization, they have concluded that they can only be relevant to the student body by more aggressively pressuring administrators in response to undergraduate concerns.
In February, when an anonymous Crimson op-ed written by a student with schizophrenia sparked the organization of a rally urging the University to take action on mental health, Raghuveer sent an email urging students to join her at the gathering.
“If ever the UC were to ‘demand relevance,’ it would be acting on this issue,” Raghuveer said at a UC general meeting several days later, where the Council voted to pass legislation calling for mental health dialogue.
These two events set the stage for a UC-sponsored mental health town hall in early March, where Harvard affiliates were given the chance to ask questions directly to representatives from Student Mental Health Services and the Administrative Board.
Pollack said he thinks the Council’s visible and vocal responses to campus mental health activism and the events in the week following the Boston Marathon bombings have spurred positive discussion among students about the Council, something he has never seen before.
“I can personally say, as the person that runs the Facebook page, we’ve gotten more shares and likes than we’ve ever gotten,” Pollack said.
Kate E. Meakem ’14, president of Phillips Brooks House Association, said that although the wide diversity of interests within the student body makes it difficult to clearly determine a single definition of relevance, she personally believes Raghuveer and Zhu have put the UC more in touch with student concerns.
“[Tara and Jen have] been purposeful in making sure that student voices are heard, especially for greater awareness on mental health issues and sending out that email during the Boston bombings,” Meakem said.
DIFFERENT APPROACH, SAME RESULTS
Administrators say they listen to students and make changes based in part on what they hear.
“College administrators meet with the UC leadership regularly, and we are in almost daily contact,” Jeff Neal, a spokesperson for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, wrote in an emailed statement. “At the same time, the College reviews policies and procedures after every incident or issue and makes adjustments based both on student feedback and on these regular evaluations.”
According to D. E. Lorraine Sterritt, the College dean for administration, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds maintains close contact with the UC.
“She meets regularly with the leadership of the Undergraduate Council to confer on their initiatives and to understand the priorities of the student body as expressed through that organization,” Sterritt wrote in an email.
But often times, these conversations do not lead to administrative action.
On widely supported referendum questions calling for divestment and sexual assault policy reform, the UC and administrators have not moved beyond the discussion table.
Although Raghuveer explained that mental health “continues to be on every agenda for [her and Zhu’s] meetings with College administrators,” there have yet to be any policy changes.
And after revelations that administrators had secretly searched the email accounts of resident deans as they sought to trace a leak of information related to the Government 1310 cheating case, the UC voted in April to express “tremendous concern” over the searches, calling for clarification of the existing student email privacy policy. That clarification never came.
And when the University’s changes have aligned with the UC’s objectives, administrators have not confirmed whether the changes were in response to pressure from the Council.
In December, just weeks after the passage of the referendum calling for the establishment of a social choice endowment fund, University President Drew G. Faust announced that one would be created. She said in a statement that the decision was based on support from both students and alumni, but she did not mention the UC.
NO LEVERAGE
UC representatives recognize that at a fundamental level, they are not able to cause change directly.
Leverett House Representative Aaron E. Watanabe ’14 said that when the Council asks for policy changes their success is controlled largely by the administration.
“We don’t have lots of money, we don’t have control over admissions, there aren’t ways for us to directly effect policy change,” Watanabe said.
He also pointed out that the UC is not the only group—and certainly not the most powerful one—that asks to be heard by the administration.
“They have a number of other constituencies. Their alumni, other administrators, there’s the [Harvard] Corporation, there’s the faculty,” Watanabe said. “There are more powerful constituencies than the UC or students in general.”
UC representatives have responded to their perceived powerlessness by taking either a nihilistic approach or a hopeful one.
In the November election, Spenser R. Goodman ’14 and Darren C. McLeod ’14 ran unsuccessfully for the positions of UC president and vice president on a platform calling solely for the improvement of social life. The candidates eschewed working with or pressuring administrators for change, suggesting that such efforts were a lost cause.
“Being a voice for students is great, but it doesn’t mean anything when that voice is never heard,” Goodman wrote in his profile on the campaign’s website.
But Raghuveer said she will not claim she can solve long-term, systemic policy issues by the end of her term precisely because of the complicated nature of these issues and the bureaucratic nature of the University. Rather, she said, by pressuring administrators now and convincing future leaders to continue that pressure, she believes that something eventually will have to change.
“If someone isn’t constantly pushing the button on something...the energy totally dissipates,” Raghuveer said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On June 10, 176 Harvard undergraduates will return to campus to participate in the Program for Research in Science and Engineering, the Behavioral Laboratory in the Social Sciences, the Program for Research in Markets and Organizations, and the Summer Humanities and Arts Research Program, ten-week summer research programs coordinated by the Office for Undergraduate Research Initiatives. These students represent less than half of the applicants, according to Gregory A. Llacer, research office director and PRISE coordinator, and just a small percentage of Harvard undergraduates who decide to pursue research during college.
Harvard has bolstered its investment in research through opportunities like those listed above and the Harvard College Research Program, which receives approximately 150 term-time applications for funding per semester and approximately 400 for the summer, according to Student Employment Office director Meg Brooks Swift ’93. Swift said the program typically funds about 80 and 70 percent of those requests, respectively.
Now, as Harvard sees some of its key research grants reduced by the federal sequester, which set funding cuts into motion on March 1 to reduce the federal budget deficit, University programs like the HCRP may experience greater demand as student interest in research continues to grow.
Nevertheless, students still see research as one of Harvard’s primary assets, and faculty and staff are confident the University will be able to match that interest.
“I think as long as students come in wanting that research experience, the pressure is going to remain on the institution to find ways, both from a faculty support as well as a funding perspective, [to support undergraduate research],” said Brooks Swift.
HARVARD’S “SELLING POINT”
Chemical and Physical Biology concentrator Richard Y. Ebright ’14 came to Harvard with some high school research experience, but his work through PRISE on a cancer drug discovery after freshman year and two more years of follow-up work in the same Harvard laboratory enhanced his desire to become a professional researcher.
Brooks Swift described access to top-quality research as Harvard’s “big selling point” for high school seniors like Ebright. And faculty and staff across disciplines are consistently striving to create—and publicize—new opportunities.
One of the major players behind this effort is Ann B. Georgi, an undergraduate research adviser for life sciences. Improvements under her tenure have included the introduction of the undergraduate research fair in 2010, which attracted about 250 mostly first-year students last fall, and the  creation of an undergraduate research handbook, made available online and in print this year.
“I’ve seen more freshmen getting started in labs and finding the right lab in the beginning and just being happy there for four years, and that’s a huge advantage for a student because they become a fully integrated member of the lab,” Georgi said.
Assistant professor of government Ryan D. Enos, who will serve as a faculty sponsor for BLISS this summer, said that increasing data analysis and infrastructure demands in the social sciences have opened up new investigative possibilities for students outside of the natural sciences as well.
“As social science becomes bigger and bigger in terms of what we can do, we need more and more manpower. We can’t just do with graduate students and professors,” Enos said.
Two new courses in the government department and the Undergraduate Research Scholars program at the Institute for Quantitative Social Science, a Harvard-affiliated research institution established in 2005, offer students the possibility to learn about political science research.
Even the humanities, which traditionally receive limited support for research, have developed new opportunities like the SHARP summer research program, which engages ten students with interdisciplinary projects that range from philosophy to digital mapping.
FUNDING UNDER THREAT?
According to Georgi, most life science concentrators who submit “well thought-out and cogent [research] proposals” will receive support for their research from Harvard funds. But federal budget cuts that went into effect earlier this year as part of the sequester have already dipped into some of Harvard’s most important government grants, with the extended impact on undergraduate research left to be seen.
Rachelle Gaudet, professor of molecular and cellular biology and a member of the PRISE selection committee, said undergraduates will not necessarily be hurt even if laboratories do see their grants go down because supporting undergraduate research is “a fairly low-cost endeavor” compared to adding graduate students.
Nevertheless, a reduction in any kind of lab staff could have long-term effects.
“The capacity to host undergraduates is sort of limited by the presence of people who are able to, you know, supervise them day to day,” Gaudet said.
Brooks Swift said she thinks more students may apply for HCRP funding as opportunities like the Research Experiences for Undergraduates grants—a program funded by the National Science Foundation—are reduced as a possible result of federal cuts. Enos expressed similar concerns over limitations on NSF funding for political science projects.
Yet students remain optimistic about research prospects.
“I predict that funding for research will rebound in the future, and that this is more than likely a temporary reduction,” said Samuel F. Wohns ’14, a social studies concentrator and recipient of the HCRP grant for independent research. “Our country sooner or later will have to realize that funding for research, like funding for other programs that serve the public interest, cannot be slashed without serious consequences.”
FUTURE ON TRACK
Pursuing innovative research is one of the highlights of achieving professorial tenure, but as tenure positions become more competitive, so too will the market for new researchers, according to Enos.
“The ratio between people with Ph.Ds and tenured members is getting worse and worse,” he said.
But even if tenured opportunities are harder to come by, Enos described the alternatives as numerous, ranging from University-affiliated research institutions that employ non-tenured faculty members and students to the private sector, where startups and political campaigns are both sources of research jobs.
Gaudet also mentioned intellectual property law and science policy as professional paths in the life sciences.
Additionally, she noted that future professional prospects are hard to predict, because budget contractions and expansions are often cyclical.
“It’s quite possible that in five years things will pick up again,” Gaudet said, adding that she encourages her students to pursue research. “The time scale of establishing a career in the sciences is such that it’s not quite clear to an undergraduate what he will be after graduate school or a postdoc.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The fall 2012 semester was well underway on a crisp afternoon in mid-November when the elected members of the Faculty Council decided they needed to set their priorities for the year. Their regular meeting for the day had been canceled, but the group wanted to meet anyway. Leaving behind the portrait-lined chambers of University Hall and the formal structure of their bi-monthly meetings, most of the Council members convened in a modern conference room on the 15th floor of William James Hall.
They set no agenda for their informal gathering and they did not invite Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith, who usually presides over the Council. The Council—FAS’s only elected professorial body—needed time alone, members say, to “know its own mind” and gauge how it might better channel faculty interests to the dean.
Beyond the walls of the conference room, the largest cheating case at Harvard in “living memory” was still unfolding and edX, the University’s nascent online educational platform, was growing faster than professors could reflect on it. Unbeknownst to the faculty, top administrators had just authorized secret searches of resident deans’ email accounts that would not be disclosed until the following March. And in February, administrators would abruptly announce the relocation of much of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences to Allston.
The choice not to communicate many of these decisions has struck some faculty as poor decision-making, but more importantly, they see the events of the past year as evidence of a flawed communication system.
In early May, the Council’s de facto leader, history professor Maya R. Jasanoff ’96, stood up at the final faculty meeting of the year to lead a vocal reconsideration of the way Harvard’s flagship faculty relates to its administrators.
Addressing colleagues disillusioned by an administration racing ahead without consulting the traditional bearers of its academic mission, Jasanoff expanded the conversation the Council had first broached in November.
“The common question that we all have is this,” she told her colleagues at the start of the nearly hour-long airing of concerns. “How effectively do the forums that we have available to us achieve the consultation and communication that we need?”
In a year when the balance of power has tipped decidedly toward administrators, there is broad faculty consensus on the answer: the forums available for faculty voice are not working as they should.
“This year has been the loudest wake-up call since Larry Summers that something is not quite right in the state of Denmark,” says psychology professor Howard E. Gardner ’65. “Now the question is what to do.”
A BROKEN TRUST
Even under normal circumstances, the responsibility for decision-making is not perfectly balanced between administrators and the faculty members they oversee, and to a great extent, faculty say they prefer it this way. Running a body as large and complex as FAS requires expertise and hours that full-time academics would rather devote to their scholarship and teaching.
Still, faculty expect a powerful hand in crafting the University’s broader vision. Many of the most important decisions on campus—from curriculum approval to personnel changes—require a faculty vote.
And for those that do not, faculty say they hope they can trust the administration to seriously solicit faculty input and heed faculty feedback.
“Around key policy issues, there needs to be a process of joint decision-making, or rather, joint problem-solving,” says sociology professor Christopher Winship, a member of Faculty Council. “It’s critical that faculty feel some ownership of the University and are willing to be committed University citizens.”
The problem, Winship and others say, arises when administrative execution falls out of step with the faculty-influenced vision. And as Harvard’s administration has swelled and initiatives like edX and expansion in Allston are reaching beyond FAS and even the University, a breakdown in communication between the faculty and administration is more likely, says government professor Michael E. Rosen.
But it was not until early March, when news broke that Smith and Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds had authorized the secret searches of resident deans’ email accounts to find the source of a leak of information pertaining to the Government 1310 cheating case, that faculty members realized the full extent of the gulf between administrative action and faculty interests.
“I think that we’re prepared to accept a lot of things that we’re told when we trust the people telling us, and that was a moment when suddenly we couldn’t trust what we were being told anymore,” Jasanoff says of the email searches, the second of which violated faculty email privacy policy. “So I think that is why people went and really started to take a step back and feel concerned about the bigger picture.”
Upon taking that step back, faculty say they feel that the email searches are just one in a chain of top-down decisions—the closing of the Financial Planning Group announced last April, the move of SEAS to Allston, the continuing “taxation” of FAS center funds—taken without considering faculty input.
“I don’t think that people believe that there’s a lot of respectful drawing of faculty opinions into decisions about anything,” says government and sociology professor and former dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Theda R. Skocpol.
In addition to the absence of consultation, Winship says the administration has not been sufficiently transparent.
“Certainly the email issue has damaged trust,” says Winship. “But on a more fundamental level is a sense among the faculty that the administration doesn’t communicate very fully with them, and as a result they don’t know what the administration is doing.”
‘THE DEAN’S CABINET’
FAS has three formal mechanisms through which communication between faculty and administration is supposed to occur. The first and most direct is the monthly faculty meeting, to which all voting members of the faculty are invited to raise concerns and questions directly to Smith, Hammonds, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, and University President Drew G. Faust. The second is a number of standing committees that analyze and offer feedback on various topics and the third is the elected Faculty Council, which meets twice a month.
Smith chairs the group of 18 elected members—four tenured and two non-tenured representatives each from the arts and humanities, social science, and natural and applied science divisions. A handful of administrative deans usually attend as guests. Ideally the Faculty Council serves as a sounding board for concerns passed up from the faculty and policies passed down from the FAS Dean.
“If professors understand that they can speak to a Faculty Council representative [who] will report back to their constituency, so to speak, then there is a flow of information between the administration and the faculty,” says English professor Louis Menand.
However, professors who have served on Faculty Council, including Menand, say that it has become an ineffective channel of communication in recent years. The FAS Dean oversees the meeting agendas and, until recently, Smith has set aside little time for informal discussion. He declined to comment for this story.
“Faculty Council has always been thought of as the Dean’s cabinet,” says German professor Peter J. Burgard, a former member of the Council. Many professors say that this perception discourages participation. Fewer than one-third of eligible faculty voted in this year’s Council election, and professors complain of a chronically low number of candidates willing to run for the three-year term.
“I think we have a sense that everything we say they will say, ‘Yes, we understand,’ but not much more,” says history professor Charles S. Maier ’60, adding that even a little more effort by administrators to listen to faculty concerns would go a long way towards repairing the lines of communication.
Faculty members also complain that the Council’s deliberations are too secretive—meeting agendas and discussions are confidential—and that the group’s elected membership is too small to represent the various, and at times conflicting, needs of the faculty.
FINDING THE FORUM
Although the need to reform the governance structure is clear, how to do so is not. Faculty acknowledge that appeals to the administration will be more successful if they can present a cohesive set of concerns. But with a diverse range of interests specific to discipline and post, this can be difficult. Furthermore, these differences are hard to reconcile within the formal framework of the faculty meeting, which represents the only opportunity for dialogue across the entire faculty body.
After administrators announced last April the unexpected and controversial closure of the popular Financial Planning Group, which provided professors with financial advising and retirement planning services, a group led by Burgard began to consider a potential faculty senate in which faculty members could articulate a collective stance on key administrative decisions, without administrative oversight.
That idea quickly faded with the academic year’s end, but the desire for some kind of faculty-only institution remains, with professors still wary of the administration’s commitment to faculty interests. Winship, who helped organize the Faculty Council’s self-evaluation in November, says that an additional deliberative forum could raise the volume of faculty input.
But other members of Faculty Council are less willing to give up on the structures already in place. Jasanoff, who has led the charge for faculty to discuss communication, says that faculty members need to fully engage the Council and monthly faculty meetings before they look outward to alternatives.
To that end, Jasanoff and other members say the Council has taken a number of key steps towards internal reform during the last year. After their November meeting, more unstructured time was incorporated into Council meetings—a development that months later permitted the Council to push for a faculty-wide conversation about governance. A committee will convene next fall to officially review the function and structure of the Council.
Faculty have also proposed a number of alternative feedback mechanisms. Concerned over proposed changes to the University policy on reporting outside activity conducted online, English professor James T. Engell ’73 advocated for the creation of a faculty Wiki to aggregate written feedback. And following the December faculty meeting, during which faculty members had their first lengthy debate on edX, a town-hall style meeting was organized to continue the conversation in an informal setting.
“I think that one of our challenges is, we need to make it easier for faculty to express themselves and for us to hear them, and that’s one reason why I applaud efforts like creating a forum or a blog or a Wiki,” Garber says.
VOLUME CONTROL
The FAS governance structure is largely reactionary in nature—a product of the early 1970s, when faculty were looking to regain control after the tumultuous years of student protests and University restructuring that marked the late 1960s. At that time, FAS decided to introduce a permanent Council to advise the FAS Dean and set the agenda for the faculty as a whole. In the decades since, the efficacy of the Council has waxed and waned with the interests of the faculty.
In 2005, 218 faculty members—a clear majority of those who voted—rallied together to issue a vote of no confidence against former University President Lawrence H. Summers when they decided he was obstructing their priorities.
Gathered at a similar faculty meeting eight years later, faculty members worried earlier this month that their existing mechanisms of governance have become stale and overly formalized.
“Individual faculty members face a decision about...whether they accept the system that’s in place or whether it is they move on,” Rosen says.
Gardner, who is in his sixth decade as a member of the University, says that it is up to the faculty to take the initiative to make things work—to be willing to take back the University owner’s manual.
“Even though the place gets bigger and more complicated, that is no excuse for losing the faculty governance and communication aspect, and so those have to be reinvented for a more complex situation,” he says. “If we don’t reinvent the good stuff it’s all going to disappear.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
He is a 17-year-old whiz-kid from Jabalpur, India who harbored aspirations of building a resume capable of getting him into MIT.
She is a 33-year-old server and office technician for the Cheesecake Factory looking for “a mental challenge.”
She is a 51-year-old mother of three who registered for an online course after reading an op-ed article about the rise of massive open online courses that left her “intrigued.”
He wanted to prove that he could earn course credit online equal to the amount required to earn a bachelors degree in one year.
She enrolled in a blended course at San Jose State University that integrated virtual learning into the classroom.
They are a handful of the approximately 900,000 people who have registered for edX, the online learning venture launched jointly by Harvard and MIT about one year ago. The edX class from the platform’s inaugural year is far from homogeneous, including a wide range of individuals with different ages, genders, ethnicities, and levels of education.
And their diversity does not just stem from measurable characteristics. While every person who logs onto edX.org is presented with the same course offerings, the motivations for signing up and committing to completing a course vary from student to student.
The swelling in the size of the edX student body has been accompanied by an enormous expansion of the platform itself. Over the past year it has grown rapidly from its two Cambridge-based founders to include a total of 27 institutional partners from across four continents, contributing to edX’s vision of what its president Anant Agarwal described as a “planet-scale transformation of education.”
While MOOC advocates hope that transformation will lead to a democratization of higher education, low completion rates and edX’s changing economic model makes increasingly relevant the question of who takes the edX course—and why.
THE ‘TYPICAL’ EDX STUDENT
Synthesizing demographic data from the month of May yields an edX student who is likely to be a 30-year-old American male with a Bachelor’s degree. But pointing out pluralities does not speak to the diversity of the virtual student body.
Geographically, the distribution of edX students is global: 13 percent come from India, 4 percent from both the United Kingdom and Brazil, 3 percent from Spain, 2 percent each from Canada, Russia, Pakistan, Egypt, and Australia, and 38 percent from other foreign countries.
About 26 percent of edX students are female and about 74 percent, male. Those who register for the program are often highly educated—34 percent have a Bachelor’s degree, 26 percent have a Master’s degree, 6 percent have a Ph.D, and 4 percent have an Associate’s degree. Eighteen percent are in high school, 2 percent are in junior high, and one percent have received no education, according to data provided by edX.
With over one million course enrollments, and students from nearly 200 countries around the world in its first year, Agarwal said he thinks the edX venture is “completely democratizing education.”
SHOPPERS, AUDITORS, AND ENROLLERS
Like the audience of a Harvard course on the first day of the semester, the people registered for edX fall into three categories: shoppers, auditors, and enrollers.
On the edX platform, those categories translate into those who sign up out of curiosity, those who watch and read the virtual material without turning in assignments, and those who successfully see the class through to the end.
The program currently offers free certificates of mastery to users who master a course at a level that would equate to a passing grade. Each certificate bears the name of the institution that created the course. For some, having that distinction delivered to their inbox is sufficient motivation to take an edX course.
Amol Bhave, a 17-year-old from Jabalpur, says the promise of a certificate was central to his decision to enroll in Agarwal’s course, MITx 6.002x: “Circuits and Electronics.”
“It’s a thing to be proud of to have a certificate with the MIT name on it, especially here in India,” Bhave said.
After Bhave earned a 97 percent grade on the course’s final exam, he created his own online course that integrated videos, a grading mechanism, and a syllabus in a style inspired by the edX platform. An impressed Agarwal wrote a recommendation letter for Bhave to MIT, which ultimately helped his admission to the prestigious school.
“Without edX, I couldn’t have even dreamt of colleges,” Bhave said. “It changed my life, and edX is going to change the world.”
At the other extreme is Doty, a 33-year-old who works at a Virginia-based Cheesecake Factory, who said she was motivated to take CS50x: “Introduction to Computer Science I” by the promise of “mental stimulation” but that she had no intention of completing it.
“I also have dipped my toes in others just to take a look, consciously knowing it wouldn’t fit my schedule, but wanting to keep it in mind for the future,” Doty said.
Diana M. B. Chen ’16, a Harvard freshman, watched edX lecture videos late into the night in her Weld dorm room in the hopes of exploring subjects she could not pursue in the classroom due to her commitments as a coxswain for the Harvard Men’s Varsity rowing team.
Yet edX disappointed Chen, who said she felt many of her virtual classmates ignored the educational benefits of courses in their fixation on earning a certificate. She described her MOOC experience as “not even a tenth of what it’s like to go to Harvard.”
COMPLETION VALUE
Low rates of completion suggest that while individuals register for edX for different reasons, many students do not see an explicit value in the certificate itself.
Computer science lecturer David J. Malan ’99 tracked the number of students who engaged with his virtual course, CS50x, from start to finish. Out of the 150,349 students who registered for CS50x, 10,905 submitted the first problem set. Of that group, 3381 individuals said they hoped to get a certificate out of the course, and only 1388 actually received one.
According to data collected by MITx with funds from the National Science Foundation, that same trajectory occurred in Agarwal’s course 6.002x, for which 154,763 people registered, 26,349 turned in the first problem set, 9,318 students passed the midterm, and 7,157 ended up certified.
Like Chen, some edX students said they would prioritize other commitments or in-person educational experiences over the virtual classroom, especially because there is no tangible value—such as a GPA boost or course credit—associated with the edX certificate.
For others, like John Chirikjian, an 18-year-old high school senior from Maryland who did not finish CS50x, a certificate is unnecessary as long as one has learned something new.
“Certificates don’t mean anything. I’m looking to learn things, not to earn a degree or get credit,” Chirikjian said. “EdX does not transfer to anything.”
Malan agreed that “completion rates have been overemphasized in the MOOC community.”
“Saying only 10 percent or 1 percent of students have finished a MOOC is misleading,” he said. “To argue that they are not effective educational opportunities is true for some students but not all.”
CHARGING FOR THE CERTIFICATE
Currently, edX does not charge its users any fees for participating, but the non-profit is considering multiple financial models to ensure its endurance—including a charge for face-to-face professor contact or certificates.
Some Harvard professors have said that charging for courses could increase completion rates by giving MOOC students a financial incentive to complete their courses.
This theory has already been tested in flipped classrooms, in which colleges supplement in-class material with online information.
“The likelihood of the completion would then go up if we charge $100 or set it up as an academic experiment,” said Jorge I. Dominguez, a government professor and Harvard’s vice provost for international affairs, after outlining a hypothetical financial model. “We would charge $1,000 for the  course, and for every week you complete, we would rebate $100, and if you complete it and pass it at the end, it would be free.” Dominguez added that there is a difference between “for-profit” and “for-free”—edX could charge its students without making any money.
Still, there are those who say charging for online courses hinders edX’s founding goal of democratizing knowledge.
“Having courseware open and free so that everyone can access high quality education is a real fundamental part of online learning,” said Bhave. “If I had to pay, I might not have taken the course.”
If someone like Bhave is to remain a version of the edX student, the online platform will have to ensure its future accessibility and relevance to its constituents.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Before coming to college, Elizabeth rarely drank alcohol, save a few sips at a party. Her first night at Harvard, that changed.
Elizabeth remembers hunting for something to do with her roommates the first day of freshman year. They ended up following a large group of students into a dorm room where, she says, everyone was drinking.
“And that was my very first shot of vodka,” she recalls.
The situation described by Elizabeth, who, like the other students in this story, was granted anonymity by The Crimson so that her name would not be associated with underage drinking, is not unusual at Harvard. According to Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67, survey data collected by the Freshman Dean’s Office through alcohol.edu, an online alcohol prevention course completed by incoming freshmen, has found that 70 percent of undergraduates do not identify as drinkers before arriving in Cambridge. By the time they graduate, that percentage flips, with 77 percent of Harvard students saying they choose to drink, according to the Drug and Alcohol Peer Advisors.
Students say the freedom of being away from home and expectations that everyone parties in college contribute to a freshman drinking culture that tends towards dangerous habits like binge drinking, generally defined as four drinks for women and five drinks for men in two hours or less.
When College administrators embarked on a review of the undergraduate alcohol policy in 2011, binge drinking was among the problems they sought to address. The new policy, released in March 2012 and approved by the faculty that November, banned “[a]ctivities that promote high-risk drinking, such as excessive and/or rapid consumption of alcohol, particularly of a competitive nature.”
Still, the College’s new alcohol policy has targeted upperclassman drinking in the Houses, and the status quo for freshmen remains: after the rule change, as before, all alcohol is banned from the Yard.
Limited by the fact that administrators cannot police an illegal activity like underage drinking, many say Harvard has yet to find a solution to the freshman drinking problem.
A FRESHMAN PROBLEM
Although the number of alcohol-related visits to University Health Services has decreased for all class years since 2011, over 50 percent of those visits are by freshmen, according to UHS spokesperson Lindsey Baker.
Both students and administrators said they have observed a significant drinking culture among first-year students, the majority of whom come to Harvard relatively inexperienced with alcohol. Freshman students said they take advantage of the newfound freedom of living without parental supervision to experiment.
Dingman said he thinks some students may “rush to catch up” on the drinking they avoided in high school when they come to campus freshman fall. Although the majority of undergraduates may not identify as drinkers when they enroll, survey data collected by UHS indicates that students overestimate the percentage of their peers who consume alcohol.
Being presented with the opportunity to drink, often for the first time, can push freshmen over the edge. Elizabeth, an athlete, described binge drinking as “very common” at bonding events for student groups like sports teams and alcohol use more broadly as a dominant part of the social scene at Harvard.
“Every party was all about drinking,” she said of her freshman year. “Most freshmen learned how to drink.”
Because freshmen who choose to drink often want to hide it from their proctors, said Dingman, they might resort to hard alcohol “that you can conceal” and consume “in a rapid fire way.”
Anna, a member of the class of 2016 who said she drank almost every weekend this past year, said she believes some freshmen feel pressured to “load up on hard alcohol” before going out, for fear that they will not be able to find a drink after leaving their rooms. She pointed to February’s freshman formal as an example of an event where students pre-gamed “really hard.”
“A lot of freshmen are inexperienced drinkers when they come here, and sadly the culture here tends to be shots,” Crimson Yard freshmen resident dean Catherine R. Shapiro said. “The problem with that is that they hit your system so fast that students can end up putting themselves in situations that are pretty scary.”
AN UPPERCLASSMAN POLICY
When in 2011 the College decided to review its policy governing student drinking habits, it held a series of meetings throughout the dorms to solicit student feedback on existing rules. These meetings were sparsely attended—only six students went to the discussion designated for freshmen, four of whom were representatives from the Undergraduate Council.
Despite poor turnout, someone brought up the idea that unsafe drinking habits form during freshman year at almost every meeting.
When a committee drafted a revised policy just a few months later, it introduced new regulations that banned high-risk drinking games while also reversing a rule created in spring 2011 that had banned mixed drinks from House formals.
But those changes were specific to upperclassmen. Despite the repeated articulation of a freshman problem, the alcohol policy did not include guidelines governing the Yard.
“The new policy wasn’t really new for the Yard at all,” Dingman said. “I was part of lots of conversations about it, but it really impacted the Houses more—almost entirely.”
According to Rakesh Khurana, Cabot House Master and chair of the alcohol policy committee, the policy was drafted with the understanding that the nature of alcohol use differed between upperclassmen and freshmen. Rather than try to create a “one size fits all” policy, Khurana said, the committee wanted to address the fact that freshmen and upperclassmen face different sets of issues when it comes to alcohol consumption. Administrators never intended to ignore freshmen, Khurana said.
“There are people who are old enough to drink in the upperclass Houses. That creates a very different type of situation,” he said.
The FDO plays the largest role in addressing alcohol use in the Yard. Its approach, Dingman said, focuses on education, rather than discipline. For example, the College this past year developed a new, Harvard-specific alcohol education program for incoming freshmen. “Harvard Proof” will be used for the first time with the class of 2017.
But administrators and students both said that while Harvard can focus on education, it is limited in the ways it can address alcohol use in the freshman class because of the legal drinking age of 21.
Anna said that while in an ideal world Harvard would find steps to encourage healthier drinking habits among freshmen, such as serving alcohol at freshman formal to discourage pre-gaming, she recognizes that the majority of freshmen are under 21, preventing the College from condoning alcohol use in the first-year class.
“They’re sort of limited in their power,” she said. “I think part of the problem is just the national laws that prevent Harvard from creating a safer environment.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While some students shop for classes and comb the course catalogs the first week of each semester to design the perfect schedule, others look to a different authority to pick their classes: emailed lists of “gems.”
The lists—which circulate over email listservs of student organizations, athletic teams, and social clubs—cull together Q Guide data, student opinion, and faculty reputations to provide undergraduates with a comprehensive set of “easy classes,” colloquially referred to as the gems of the Harvard course catalog.
But “gem” can be a misnomer, and the concept can lead to academic distress for those who enroll in courses based on the opinions of peers rather than personal academic interest.
In the wake of the cheating scandal in Government 1310: “Introduction to Congress,” a course that had a reputation as an easy course, Harvard’s academic culture has come under fire. Among the issues at hand is the shirking of scholastic rigor, a practice that many argue is nothing new at Harvard.
SETTING PRIORITIES
One email list of easy courses compiled early this semester was forwarded to at least seven athletic teams and social organizations in less than two weeks. Classes were annotated with comments such as “infamous” and “retarded easy.”
Still, students interviewed by The Crimson said that seeking out easy courses is about figuring out how to create a manageable schedule rather than laziness.
For players in season, practice and matches can restrict the time they can dedicate to classes and may prompt student-athletes to look for a lighter workload. To get around this limitation, Jack J. Holuba ’13, an offensive lineman on the football team, took a summer school class so that he could take just three courses during the fall.
This desire for a balanced schedule is shared by athletes and non-athletes alike.
Students said they are especially drawn to gems when trying to meet Gen Ed requirements, which are often outside their preferred disciplines.
Abby L. Noyes ’16, a prospective history of literature concentrator, said that she chose Science of Living Systems 19: “Nutrition and Global Health,” which has had a Q Guide workload rating lower than 1.6 out of 5 for the last three years, over Science of Living Systems 20: “Psychological Science” because of perceived difficulty level.
“I was originally looking between the two, but SLS 19 had less requirements,” Noyes said. “I didn’t want to spend hours and hours doing something for stuff that I am not remotely interested in.”
A prospective government concentrator, who asked to remain anonymous because she did not want her personal academic practices known, added that although SLS 19 was not as easy as anticipated, those of her classmates who expected a “gem” neglected to give the class their full attention.
“Lecture was sparsely attended,” the student said. “I didn’t do any of the readings for the class, and I was actually fine.”
FROM GUTS TO GEMS
Gems are not a new concept. In fact, they were called “guts” when Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 was an undergraduate at the College.
“There were courses that were notoriously forgiving,” recalled Dingman. “There were names for them: ‘Rocks for Jocks’ was a natural science course in the Gen Ed curriculum and Fine Arts 13, an introductory art course, was referred to affectionately as ‘Darkness at Noon,’” he said, adding that it was nicknamed for all of the students who fell asleep during its lunchtime lecture.
Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris wrote in an email that he was “intrigued,” but not surprised that students seek out less difficult academic opportunities.
“I realize that every generation of college students thinks history begins with them, but, really, classes students identify as easy have been around a long time, at Harvard and everywhere else,” Harris wrote. “There have always been and will always be students who seek out courses they think are easier—not always correctly, I might add.”
Dingman agreed that judging a class by its perceived academic rigor is not the best way to pick classes.
“If they are assembling these lists, the effort is misguided,” he said. “It doesn’t take into account what a student is interested in.”
PANNING FOR GOLD
Nevertheless, new technologies and increased virtual communication between students has in many ways made it easier to mine for gems.
According to an athlete with a close connection to a list of “gems” circulated early this term, it was put together “strictly by looking at the Q Guide.”
“I don’t think people use [the Q Guide] as much as they should,” he said. He noted that the difficulty of a course should be evaluated within the broader context of a student’s full schedule—an easy class can be an important complement to an otherwise difficult course load.
In addition to taking account of emailed course lists that are forwarded from one student group to another, many undergraduates use the Q Guide to tailor their shopping lists and final schedule. Although students cannot filter the official Q Guide by difficulty level, resources like “Harvard Courses,” a CS50 course selection tool, can sort classes by any of the Q Guide parameters, including difficulty.
Dingman cautioned against an overreliance on past Q Guide data.
“I’ve been aware of faculty changing what they are requiring as a result [of Q Guide feedback],” Dingman said.
While many professors are aware of their course’s reputation, they do not always agree with student assessment of rigor.
Anthropology 1190: “Encountering the Conquistadors” was last taught in the spring of 2009 but ended up on a recent list of easy classes when the course was offered again this term—a point of confusion for its instructor, Matthew J. Liebmann. Liebmann, an associate professor in anthropology, said that an easy class would allow a student to produce little work and still earn a good grade, a pattern he said is inconsistent with Anthropology 1190’s grading policies.
Indeed, the course may not have been as simple as some had expected. Several students confirmed that classmates left the exam room during the midterm in March to look for answers to identification questions on their cell phones.
Liebmann declined to comment on the affair, but Holuba, who took the course, said that the final examination incorporated changes to avoid further cheating. Students could not receive the essay portion of the test until they had turned in the identification section, he said, nor could they bring cell phones to the restroom.
“I think that students’ concern about their transcript has increased over time,” said Dingman, citing economic uncertainty and pressures coming into college as potential causes for the shift. “I go back to my own experience—people were less concerned with what they would do at the end of it.”
The student with knowledge of the list of easy classes said he thinks a “minority” of students create an entire schedule based on Q scores and difficulty rating. But he acknowledged that there is a tendency to prioritize the final grade over the learning experience.
“I think the culture is that kids would rather get an A and not do a whole lot than actually challenge themselves,” he said. “The pressure gets to you.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Several years out from the worst economic crisis in a generation, Harvard and the unions that represent workers on campus have struggled through some of the longest negotiations in the unions’ history as they attempt to define a new era of labor relations.
Members and supporters of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers—which represents more than 4,600 members of Harvard’s non-faculty staff—stood out in front of Massachusetts Hall twice a week beginning in January to advance their cause, and the union held its first rally ever in Memorial Church in March.
Although both HUCTW and the University eventually expressed satisfaction with the settlement they reached in March, union leaders said that there are significant issues like health care that remain unresolved.
In the wake of these difficult discussions, University employees have raised concerns over the nature of Harvard’s approach to labor relations after the financial crisis.
GOOD, BUT NOT GOOD ENOUGH
Despite difficult negotiations, workers seem generally satisfied with Harvard as an employer. In an employee engagement survey administered by the University at the end of 2011, all of Harvard’s schools scored at or above the “best employer” range, according to Marilyn Hausammann, vice president for human resources.
And Harvard Labor Relations Director Bill Murphy said that the University provides benefits that cannot be found elsewhere.
“For our lowest wage earners working together with the unions we have healthcare benefits available for people with 16 hours of employment. There’s no employer in the area that matches that threshold,” Murphy said. He also said that Harvard is the top-paying employer of campus police in the area.
Hausammann added that in terms of salaries, Harvard compensates close to or more than local universities, other Ivy League universities, and local employers, and during HUCTW negotiations, University officials cited the fact that Harvard ranked in the 75th percentile for the average compensation for those workers compared to large employers in the Northeast.
But HUCTW director Bill Jaeger criticized the University’s standards.
“[HUCTW workers] said, ‘Show me one other measurement in which Harvard would be happy to be at the 75th percentile compared to other universities. Any measure—literally anything,’” Jaeger said. “Education doesn’t work right and research doesn’t work right in our experience unless we have a terrific staff, better than the 75 percentile in terms of skills and effort.”
And while University employees make near or above market wages, union officials said that these rates do not provide workers with appropriate financial security.
“$40,000 is not a lifestyle that encourages people to be home with their families,” said Wayne M. Langley, director of higher education for SEIU Local 615, the union that represents Harvard custodial workers. “It’s a low enough salary that there is hardship, and the question is if Harvard has the wherewithal to eliminate that hardship.”
AN UNCERTAIN RECOVERY
When the financial crisis struck in 2008, Harvard’s endowment dropped by $11 billion between June 2008 and June 2009.
Jaeger said that HUCTW’s 2010 negotiations immediately following the recession were fairly straightforward. “At that point I think everybody was struggling in the most basic ways of how are we going to cope with the huge loss of value in the endowment,” he said.
Last year’s negotiations, however, “turned out to be much harder,” Jaeger said. He attributed the difficulty in part to what he called “a mixed economic picture.”
This uncertainty lay at the heart of the negotiations as the administration and unions disputed the extent to which Harvard is still recovering from the recession.
Jaeger recalled one of the more difficult meetings of the year, in which he said the phrases “terrified” and “scared to death” were used in descriptions of the University’s economic future.
“We just thought that was hyperbolic,” Jaeger said. “Yes it’s a more complex time and more volatile than six or seven years ago but the University is making bold confident plans with regard to a number of key challenging areas and the University can make a confident plan with regard to the employee part of the model also.”
According to John T. Trumpbour, research director at the Harvard Law School’s Labor and Worklife Program, although Harvard lost money during the recession, the University has since recovered.
On the other hand, S. Paul Reville, former Massachusetts Secretary of Education and a professor at the Graduate School of Education, said that Harvard is not alone among universities in striving to keep costs down in the current economic climate.
“Higher education continues to struggle against rising costs and an inflation for the cost of education that tends to exceed the cost of living generally,” he said. “The institutions are number one, coping with the recession still and, number two, trying to control costs and not trying to pass along burden to students.”
Murphy said that not only has the endowment suffered under a volatile market, but other revenue sources have shrunk as well, including tuition, for-profit executive education program revenues, and government funding.
“It felt like we were unconstrained financially [before the recession] and then the bottom fell out around the world,” Hausammann said. “That has made us alert to the fact that we have to make choices, make investments, and make trade offs.”
Yet despite the more complicated financial picture, Murphy maintained that Harvard is a “very progressive employer.” According to Murphy, the typical wage increase in the area in the current economic environment is 2.5 percent, and the University has consistently negotiated raises of between 2.5 to three percent.
HUCTW’s recently negotiated contract includes a first year 3.4 percent retroactive wage increase for the typical HUCTW employee with at least one year of service.
MAXIMIZING THE MISSION
But even with Harvard’s above-market compensation, some argue that Harvard’s status as a tax-exempt non-profit requires that it be held to a higher labor standard.
“When an institution does get a tax break...they do have a little bit more of a community obligation than a corporation,” Trumpbour said. “The danger is when a university becomes dismissive of its community obligations.”
Daniel Meagher, the president of the Harvard University Security, Parking, and Museum Guard Union said that the tension Harvard is experiencing—between the corporate model and its progressive, liberal identity—is one that is currently playing out all across the country.
Meagher argued that while the University frequently cites the standards set by the market during negotiations, it is the “social, political, and economic environment of Harvard,” specifically, that matters.
Referencing the health care benefits requested by the unions, Jaeger said that the University has a responsibility to be an innovative employer.
“We’re well aware, eyes wide open, that we’re asking Harvard in the health care area to do things that are really unusually progressive and innovative. And we think that’s exactly right,” Jaeger said.
Still, Hausammann said that the University’s non-profit status does not make it immune to consideration of the financial implications of its decisions.
“Considering economic factors isn’t at odds with being a non-profit,” she said. “We are fortunate not to be limited by quarterly results or shareholder demands, and that means that we need to be focusing on maintaining our ability to provide education, research, etc. for the years to come.”
Others agreed that the need to fund cutting-edge research and maintain a high quality of scholarship is just as important an element of Harvard’s financial commitment as supporting its staff. “I think we’re maximizing our ability to fulfill [Harvard’s] mission,” Murphy said. “Every dollar that goes towards the lab might be [toward] that lab that cures cancer.”
A NEW NORMAL?
After the lengthy and difficult negotiations with HUCTW this year, many unions have voiced concerns that future labor relations at Harvard will prove just as difficult.
“The big question at stake in our 2012 issues, or one of them that’s still being played out in other negotiations going on right now, is what is the new normal really going to be?” Jaeger said.
For Langley, the new normal promises contention. He stressed that Harvard’s progressive labor practices emerged only after concentrated effort from unions and the wider Harvard community. “In the future, we will have to fight harder to maintain those standards,” he said.
Jaeger said that during the negotiations, it became clear that uncertainty about Harvard’s future as an employer is rooted within the administration itself.
“I think there’s at least some confusion in senior administrative circles about what sort of employer Harvard is trying to be,” he said.
Yet Murphy maintained that although the two sides may disagree, the administration and the union leaders have strong, longstanding relationships that will enable them to deal with the difficult problems that need to be resolved.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With cockroach-infested rooms in Dunster, shoebox-sized doubles in Kirkland, and clogged pipes in Adams, the undergraduate residences at Harvard have in recent years become increasingly inadequate to serve the needs of the College’s students.
In 2006, Merle Bicknell, assistant dean of physical resources and planning in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, realized that the Houses, still historically significant but also physically deteriorated, needed a full-scale renovation.
“There was a realization of the fact that these buildings were over 100 years old,” she said. “In the eight to ten weeks you get in the summertime, you can’t change out an entire [heating, ventilation, and air conditioning] system or change out all the plumbing.”
Striving to live up to the House system’s more than 80-year-old aim of creating a dynamic living-learning community, Harvard embarked on a multi-billion dollar House renewal project in 2008. The project, now in its first phases of construction, will transform the interior of the Houses and give Harvard’s residential buildings a full set of modern accommodations.
But House renewal entails more than just restoring the College’s residential facilities to tip-top physical shape.
“Improving the undergraduate experience is very much a goal of renewal,” said Quincy House Master Lee Gehrke. “It’s bricks and mortar...but the goal is broader than that. That’s done by improving the communities, but also providing new types of spaces.”
As administrators, architects, and students discuss renovation plans, they face the reality that when it comes to residential preferences, one size does not fit all.
But changes to the spatial arrangement of the Houses may also dramatically change the way students use these spaces, and House renewal presents project leaders with the opportunity to shape students’ interaction with their community.
“It really revitalizes not just the space, but the people in it,” said Stephen Lassonde, dean of student life. “It’s really a transformation in their relationship to where they’re living and their community.”
CREATING COMMUNITY
When former Harvard President Abbott Lawrence Lowell, Class of 1877, envisioned the House system in 1929, he aimed to bring Harvard’s students together in unifying communities of their peers. As the College embarks on its first comprehensive renewal effort since then, improving community remains a central goal and physical changes have been designed specifically to foster group interactions.
To adhere to rigorous Massachusetts disability laws and fire codes, architects created a residential model for Old Quincy that incorporates vertical entryways, a facet of the traditional neo-Georgian House model, and short horizontal hallways that stretch across the building and between entryways. Some areas of the House will be configured as traditional suites while others will feature “cluster communities,” in which single and double bedrooms, a bathroom, and a common room branch off from a central hallway.
Administrators said that the addition of horizontal hallways in the renovated layout will enhance social encounters in the Houses by increasing face-to-face encounters.
“Because of the old layout, the people who lived in the first floor didn’t really see the people on the fourth floor,” Gehrke said. “Now it’s going to be much, much better for informal conversations.”
Indeed, seniors who live in New Quincy said they relish the tradition of living together in suites along horizontal hallways because of the strong sense of community such a layout creates.
“You really become a tight-knit community because you really have to walk by everybody at some point. You get caught in the elevator with them and end up catching up,” said Scott J. Yim ’13, a former Quincy House Committee Co-Chair.
Also crucial to these community building efforts are plans to construct common spaces in previously unused or inefficiently occupied rooms, such as those that once housed squash courts or now-obsolete machinery.
“There’s an amazing amount of space in these Houses, but it’s unusable,” said Bicknell.
For example, while all Houses have a Junior Common Room, these more formal spaces currently do not accommodate the many student organizations and other groups who need space around campus, according to Stephen Kieran, whose architecture firm KieranTimberlake designed the Old Quincy renovations.
“They didn’t have 700 student groups on campus in 1930,” he quipped.
Kieran’s plans for Quincy introduced what he described as “casual student life spaces,” including a large multipurpose room, music practice rooms, classrooms, and a terrace, which he envisions as a venue for everything from formal meetings to casual studying. Throughout the process, Kieran and administrators solicited student input on the designs through focus groups, surveys, and student involvement in the House Program Planning Committee. With more space specifically tailored to their needs, students will be able to convene and spend time together in ways they could not have before.
RIGHT TO PRIVACY
Despite the incorporation of additional common space into the renovation plans, some students said that their need for private space is being neglected.
For these students, the flip-side of the cluster community is the lack of a private common room—a place where they can hold social gatherings and parties on their own terms.
Yim, who toured a mock-up of a room in renovated Old Quincy last year, said he would not have wanted to live in a cluster community during his time as a Quincy resident without control over his common room.
During his sophomore year, Yim lived in a three-room triple in Old Quincy. Despite having to use the common room as a walk-through, Yim and his roommates liked the set-up.
“I loved the way that Old Quincy was laid out before. I liked having the option to choose whether or not you wanted to use it as a walk-through,” Yim said. “I think that versatility was great.”
Administrators seem to have a less clear vision of how students will be able to host social events with much less private space.
“And as far as partying, they always seem to find a party someplace,” said Quincy House Master Deborah J. Gehrke, when asked about the availability of party space when House renewal is complete. She specifically referenced rooms on the sixth floor of New Quincy, which are often host to parties on weekend nights.
“They love the sixth floor because they don’t have to get dressed,” she said. “Rain or shine, freezing degrees, they don’t have to go outside.”
Administrators said that cluster communities, where hallway common rooms can be locked by residents, will function and feel like suites of their own.
“The cluster will feel like a community in its own right,” said Kieran, adding that fireplaces and study nooks will line the hallways and create a cozy feel.
Students who toured the nearly-complete construction site agreed that the short hallways connecting vertical entryways do not feel like the long, anonymous hallways found at some colleges.
“It doesn’t feel like this enormous hallway. It does still feel very intimate,” said Catherine G. Katz ’13, a former Quincy House Committee co-chair.
Lassonde, who served as a dean of one of Yale University’s 12 undergraduate residential colleges when they were undergoing renovations, argued that improved public and private spaces are not mutually exclusive. “When you look at the ratio of public to private space, it looks like there’s an encroachment of public space on private space, but what happens is there’s just much more public space,” he said.
SPATIAL LIMITATIONS
Students and administrators alike agreed that House renewal should aim to improve community spirit and life, but some students questioned whether the project will achieve that goal.
“While I think that the hallways and the new common spaces will facilitate the vision that a lot of the leaders in the House have, I don’t know if, because of the common rooms or the hallways, you’re going to see blossoming House spirit,” Katz said.
Leverett House Committee Co-Chair Manny M. Mendoza ’14 said that there will always be a group of students committed to cohesion in the House, regardless of spatial issues. “We always have a solid core of people who are always interested in maintaining an active community,” he said.
Still, Mendoza said he is concerned with preserving community life during construction on McKinlock Hall, the neo-Georgian portion of Leverett where the second set of House renovations will begin this summer. During the renovations, Leverett students will live in five different buildings for the school year.
“I don’t know how [House life] is going to survive,” he said.
Yim also questioned whether renovations alone could make House social space more relevant.
“I think Harvard in general has had a challenge in social space in recent years and that discussion is being presented in front of administrators,” Yim said.
He added that new spaces in the Houses could end up as just more under-utilized space.
“I do think that [the issue of social space] is much more nuanced than just adding new amenities and just renovating a building,” he said. ”I do think it is steps forward. I don’t think there’s a simple solution.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With rising tuition costs and shrinking employment opportunities for law school graduates, students across the country are questioning their decision to go to law school—but not at Harvard.­
Facing a job market still recovering from the recession, law schools have seen a 13.4 percent drop in applicants. Those who do apply submit 18.8 percent fewer applications.
Although applications to Harvard Law School fell by 14.6 percent last year and 16.4 percent the year before, this year is different, according to the school’s Assistant Dean and Chief Admissions Officer Jessica L. Soban ’02.
“We don’t look anything like that,” she said, adding that official numbers will be released in the fall.
As law schools throughout the United States struggle in the face of a shrinking number of opportunities available to graduates, employment rates for Harvard Law School alumni have remained somewhat constant over the past 20 years, according to Soban, a former Crimson business editor.
“It’s a really attractive time to go to a top-tier law school,” she said.
A SAFE BET
For the past three years, the Law School’s after-graduation employment rate has been about 95 percent. Most recent graduates have found full-time, long-term positions in the legal field that required the passage of the bar exam. As of mid-February, 515 of the 590 graduates of the Class of 2012 had filled such positions, according to Mark A. Weber, assistant dean for career services at the Law School. At just over 87 percent, that figure is significantly different from the comparable 56.2 percent national employment rate reported by the American Bar Association.
At schools across the country, the problem is the economy as graduates struggle to find work despite their new law degrees.
“My sense is that whether law school is worth it or not... strongly depends on how well-situated a school is and what its employment numbers look like,” said I. Glenn Cohen, who was recently granted tenure at the Law School. “For schools like Harvard, Yale, and Stanford, our students do very well. Our numbers are fantastic. It’s a pretty easy bet.”
The debt accumulated in law school, which often totals more than $100,000, makes less sense for students at lower-ranked schools, he said.
Weber said that students today are behaving rationally and performing a “cost-benefit analysis” as they assess employment opportunities after graduation.
“Many are saying that in their particular situations, it’s not a value proposition they want to take, especially when the prospects for post-graduate employment are grim,” he said. “Fortunately, that’s not a question that students at Harvard are asking.”
First-year law student Elizabeth T. Burns said she thinks Harvard is still a good bet.
“The Harvard Law School name gets you places,” she said.
According to Weber, this sentiment is widespread as Harvard students remain optimistic about job opportunities after graduation despite economic uncertainty.
“When you go to a top-tier school, the outlook is always good,” he said. “The real difference is during difficult economic times, it’s just a little bit harder and may take a while longer to land a job.”
A WORTHWHILE EDUCATION
Part of Harvard’s advantage extends beyond its name to the classroom experience.
Harvard Law professor William P. Alford said that the comparative value of the education at the Law School and other top law schools contributes to the optimistic prospects of its graduates.
“There’s an incredible diversity of law and legal viewpoints about the law among the faculty here,” he said. “It’s really great for students to get that exposure to that range of viewpoints. It’s a very stimulative environment.”
Alford said that a Harvard Law School education can prepare students for many professions, although he noted that students should not rule out the possibility of practicing law.
“You are simultaneously engaging in the world of ideas and the application of those to behavior,” he said. “The best legal education is going to help people think of multiple solutions to a problem.”
Another reason Harvard Law School graduates fare better in the post-recession job market could be the programs instituted to make low-paying public interest jobs financially viable.
“The problem isn’t that there are too many lawyers,” said Law School Dean Martha L. Minow. “It’s that there isn’t enough access to justice for poor people.”
The Law School’s Public Service Venture Fund provides fellowships for students entering the public sector, while the Low Income Protection Plan­ forgives student debt.
AN EXPANDING PROFESSION
In addition, the interdisciplinary nature of the Law School’s curriculum gives students an advantage after they graduate by enabling them to pursue jobs beyond the standard legal route. The Law School faculty, which includes an increasing number of professors with Ph.D.’s, has recently expanded to non-traditional areas of law with institutes like the Berkman Center for Internet and Society and the Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics.
“The current generation of aspiring students has only greater opportunities, which include the expanding global connections,” Minow said. “People with legal training are at the heart of addressing some of the most pressing legal issues in the country today.”
Burns agreed that the options for law students are now more varied. “A legal education is not necessarily a one-track path to a firm anymore,” she said.
For example, Harvard Law School prepares students for careers in the healthcare field, which represents a growing sector of the legal profession, according to Cohen, who teaches courses in bioethics and health law.
“With the Affordable Care Act, a 1,600 page document, the result has been the need for a huge amount of lawyers,” he said. “I happen to teach in health law where we have a significant under-supply of intelligent J.D.’s. I think that the fact that Harvard has great programming in this area is a huge plus for us.”
Hoping to attract more interdisciplinary students to the Law School, Harvard recently announced a new deferred admissions program for juniors at Harvard College that specifically targets students with backgrounds in STEM—science, technology, engineering, and math.
“There are lots of jobs where those skills are in high demand,” Cohen said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When teaching United States in the World 26: “Sex and the Citizen: Race, Gender, and Belonging in the United States” this past spring, women, gender, and sexuality lecturer Caroline Light left little room for interpretation on what constituted appropriate and inappropriate collaboration.
Light laid out her guidelines during lecture, included a statement “clearly” outlining her expectations on every assignment, and prominently featured her collaboration policies on her course iSite.
She said she thinks there is a ”rising awareness, not just among students, but among faculty, of the importance of clear communication around our expectations for our students.”
“Sometimes I just assume everybody knows what plagiarism is, and I can’t do that,” she added.
Light is one of many faculty members who have attempted to make their collaboration policies explicit in the wake of Harvard’s August announcement of a cheating scandal unprecedented in scope. Throughout the fall semester, the Administrative Board investigated roughly 125 undergraduates accused of inappropriately collaborating or plagiarizing on the spring 2012 final take-home exam in Government 1310: “Introduction to Congress.”
In the days following the announcement of the investigation, faculty questioned what impact heightened scrutiny of student work prompted by the scandal would have on the classroom. There was value, they said, in certain types of collaboration.
“The reason that [study guides] existed in the first place was that they were actually helpful to students,” government professor Stephen D. Ansolabehere told The Crimson in August. “What’s going to happen in chemistry when you can’t take in some study guides that help you remember the periodic table?”
A year after students in Government 1310 turned in their final exams, students and professors say that collaboration in the classroom remains. But with the push for faculty to clearly define their policies governing academic integrity and the proposal of Harvard’s first honor code, many say it has taken on a highly regulated form.
‘OPEN NOTE, OPEN BOOK, OPEN INTERNET, ETC.’
When the cheating scandal was announced, administrators were quick to place it within the context of a broader conversation about academic integrity at Harvard.
“[T]his alarming set of allegations requires, in our view, a new campus-wide discussion among faculty, students, and administrators about academic honesty,” Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris wrote in an email to undergraduates on August 30. “We must all work together to build a community that fully embraces the ethos of integrity that is the foundation of all learning and discovery.”
Students had said discrepancies between the policies governing assignments in Government 1310 and the actions of the course’s teaching staff had contributed to widespread cheating. The collaboration policy at the top of the course’s final exam described it as “completely open book, open note, open internet, etc.” and also prohibited students from “discuss[ing] the exam with others—this includes resident tutors, writing centers, etc.”
One student who was implicated in the cheating case told The Crimson in an email that he thought the policy was clear on paper but not in practice. Teaching fellows held office hours and worked with students before the take-home exam was due, helping with answers while students collaborated in front of them despite the written policy. The student was granted anonymity by The Crimson because he did not want to be associated with accusations of cheating.
When undergraduates returned to campus in the fall, administrators made a push to make sure collaboration policies were clear. Harris asked in his August communication that all students review the guidelines in the Student Handbook outlining Harvard’s stance on academic dishonesty. Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith urged faculty in an email at the start of the semester to include a description of their courses’ collaboration policies in their syllabi—something that faculty have been required to do since 2010—in addition to discussing those policies in class. In the email, Smith asked that faculty “share best practices on how we can each foster a culture of honesty and integrity in our classes and learning assessments.”
“Your efforts are essential to our success,” he wrote.
REGULATING COLLABORATION
In the wake of the scandal, there has been a call for faculty as well as students to foster a regulated type of collaboration and lay out the rules governing a class’s take on academic integrity in the spirit of what Smith had described.
Harris told The Crimson in an email that the request that faculty communicate their collaboration policies on their syllabi was approved “to reduce ambiguity.”
“The more information provided to students about expectations, the less likely they will accidentally run afoul of the policy in any class,” Harris wrote.
According to Harris, “a significantly increased portion” of faculty have included collaboration policy statements on their syllabi or websites this past year. Some professors further explicated their rules governing collaboration while giving their first lectures during shopping week while others emphasized the guidelines whenever passing out major assignments throughout the year.
Philosophy professor Edward J. Hall devoted almost an entire page of the syllabus for his class Philosophy 151z: “Philosophy of Quantum Mechanics” to explaining his collaboration policy this spring. His reason for doing so, reads his syllabus, was “the Notorious Cheating Scandal of 2012.”
Hall said he thinks a well-defined collaboration policy could help students better understand what is expected in terms of collaboration.
Students say that in the aftermath of the cheating scandal, they have noticed faculty’s policies governing collaboration becoming more specific and, in general, more clear.
Mariel N. Pettee ’14, a math and physics concentrator, said she has seen a change in her professors’ approach to collaboration policies, citing the final take-home exam for Mathematics 136: “Differential Geometry” as an example of rules being explicitly defined. Pettee said she appreciated that the professor in that class told her that for the test, “‘You could use any of your notes, your textbooks, you can also use resources on the internet if you need to—you just can’t collaborate with each other.’”
Still, the cheating scandal and the increasingly explicit nature of academic integrity statements on syllabi have left a small portion of students anxious about breaking policy, regardless of any intention to cheat.
The student implicated in the cheating scandal wrote that he is now afraid to collaborate at all for fear of being accused of cheating and facing the Ad Board again.
Robert T. Bowden ’13, who this year was the head teaching fellow for Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science” and has been a member of the class’s teaching staff in the past, said this fall he noticed some students worrying more about following collaboration policies in the aftermath of the cheating scandal.
Bowden said he also observed this trend when he was a TF for Computer Science 161: “Operating Systems” this spring. The class administered a take-home exam that prohibited students from using the Internet to answer questions, but allowed them to do things like check their email so long as their discussions were not about the test. Bowden recalled one student who was so concerned with following the rules that he emailed asking if it was in accordance with the policy to have sent his mother a Facebook message while taking the exam.
Administrators say the push to clarify policies governing academic integrity was not meant to place every type of collaboration under scrutiny.
Harris told The Crimson in an email that the administration did not want to “curtail collaboration where it is appropriate.”
“We all agree that collaboration is an increasingly important element of pedagogy in many disciplines. We want to enable and support collaboration among students when and where appropriate, as determined by the course instructors,” he wrote.
TOWARD AN HONOR CODE?
Some say the next step in this move toward policing collaboration is the implementation of Harvard’s first-ever honor code.
At the monthly meeting of the FAS in April, Harris presented such a proposal, drafted by the administrators, faculty, and students on the Committee on Academic Integrity. If approved and implemented, the honor code would establish a written commitment to academic integrity beyond individual faculty collaboration policies.
As written, the proposal would create a Student/Faculty Judiciary Board populated by both students and faculty exclusively to hear cases of academic dishonesty and would require students to sign a “declaration of integrity” on major assignments and exams.
Terah E. Lyons ’14, a member of the Committee on Academic Integrity, said collaboration is just one aspect of the broader conversation about academic integrity at Harvard.
“There’s been a large focus on [collaboration] because that was seemingly sort of the crux of the problem that occurred with the scandal in the fall,” Lyons said. “I think that the idea of being an honorable student or upholding honor or being someone who integrates integrity into their academic practices is a notion that includes collaboration amongst many other concepts.”
The Committee will seek more student feedback on the honor code in the fall, according to Lyons.
Light described the introduction of an honor code as a continuation of the trend towards explicitly defining collaboration policies that she and many members of the faculty followed this past year.
“It’s a public articulation of a set of standards that we hold in common,” Light said. “For me personally, since Harvard doesn’t have its own honor code, I guess that’s sort of what I’ve tried to do this year, is to keep calling students’ attention to the kinds of expectations that...people are going to conduct themselves as exemplary citizens in the classroom, that they’re going to make their best effort to adhere to our community standards for integrity.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When asked to rate their support for Occupy Harvard on a scale from 0 to 10, Harvard undergraduates, on average, gave the movement a rating of 2.84. The survey, conducted by students as part of a final project for Statistics 104 in December 2011, was telling—Occupy Harvard did not have the support of the community it claimed to represent.
By the time Occupy Harvard fizzled out in spring 2012, many students and administrators—tired of locked gates, nebulous objectives, and tents in Harvard Yard—were relieved.
But from the ashes of Occupy Harvard arose a new kind of activism. This academic year, conversations in tents have been moved to administrators’ offices, occupying has morphed into voting, and community frustration has evolved into support.
Using these new methods, undergraduate activists have primarily rallied around three issues pertaining to University policy. The Harvard chapter of Students for a Just and Stable Future has worked to convince Harvard to divest its endowment from fossil fuel companies through its Divest Harvard campaign, the Radcliffe Union of Students partnered with the International Women’s Rights Collective to launch the Our Harvard Can Do Better campaign to reform the University’s sexual assault policy, and the Responsible Investment at Harvard Coalition emerged to champion a social choice fund to support socially conscious University investments.
These new activists, many of whom participated in Occupy Harvard in fall 2011, say they have a complicated relationship with the old movement. They have simultaneously exploited the consciousness and connections that emerged on campus as a result of Occupy Harvard while trying to improve on the shortcomings of last year’s activism. In doing so, they have gained what Occupy Harvard never could—the support of students and administrators.
INDEBTED TO OCCUPY
Many activists say that Occupy Harvard laid a foundation for new campus movements by raising the profile of social and environmental justice issues and bringing activists into proximity so that they could work together.
Jennifer A. Sheehy-Skeffington, a graduate student in psychology who participated in Occupy Harvard, said she believes the movement helped raise awareness regarding social and economic inequality on campus.
“Occupy played a really big role in terms of changing people’s consciousness, both at the national level and at the Harvard level,” Sheehy-Skeffington said.
In fall 2011, Occupy Harvard participant Samuel F. Wohns ’14 and many fellow activists he met through Occupy Harvard co-founded the Responsible Investment at Harvard Coalition, a group that he said sprung out of the activist climate.
“As Occupy Harvard was winding down or losing momentum, it seemed like an opportune time to bring together these actors,” said Wohns, adding that many Occupy activists shared aspirations of pushing for change in the way Harvard invests its endowment.
“There was some consciousness on campus, largely thanks to Occupy Harvard,” Wohns, an inactive Crimson magazine editor, continued. “But there wasn’t yet a strategic plan, and we thought maybe we could fill that gap and be an organization that could develop its strategy to take advantage of this consciousness.”
Alli J. Welton ’15, a board member for the Harvard chapter of Students for a Just and Stable Future, helped found SJSF’s Divest Harvard campaign in September 2012. As with Responsible Investment, many of the members of SJSF were once involved in Occupy Harvard.
Welton said that movements like Divest Harvard and the social choice fund were able to form because of the face-to-face connections facilitated by Occupy Harvard.
“It was a really great space in terms of people coming together to meet people and grow the movement,” Welton said of the Occupy Harvard encampment.
Sheehy-Skeffington agreed with the sentiment. “Occupy enabled all of the student activists to come together,” she said. “I got involved because the issue drew me, and then I made friends with all of these people.”
“We all share that vision because we all hung out at that campsite together,” she added.
LEARNING FROM MISTAKES
Though they acknowledge their debt to Occupy Harvard, this year’s activists say that the movement’s tactics—the way it went about starting conversations and bringing people together—alienated much of the undergraduate student body.
Welton said she thinks the lack of student support for Occupy resulted more from disapproval of the movement’s methods than from apathy about the fundamental issues.
“I remember talking with people in my dorm, and they were really annoyed because the Yard was on lockdown, and it was really inconvenient,” Welton said. “But if you talk to them about economic inequality or the issues that the movement was dealing with, they were really sympathetic and they cared about those things.”
One reason for this disconnect, Welton said, was that the insularity of the movement may have intimidated potential supporters. Another problem, she said, was the movement’s rapid escalation. She said that if Occupy had tried to make progress little by little, instead of jumping immediately to occupation and disruption, it might have enjoyed more broad-based support from the student body and left a broader impact.
“I think it taught me a lot about what escalation should be in a movement,” said Welton. “What I saw with Occupy was that they escalated from day zero. You can’t just show up from day zero and try to take over Mass Hall. You have to do the groundwork first of building a broad base of support.”
While Occupy Harvard activists had worked outside the system to build a movement and make their demands, three undergraduate activism campaigns this fall employed a different strategy. Working within the system, they utilized the referendum process buried in the legislative business section of the Undergraduate Council constitution, a process that had not been used since 2006, to generate widespread student support for their causes.
In accordance with this philosophy, RI launched the Fair Harvard Fund, an alternative fund designed to withhold donations that would go towards Harvard’s endowment until the creation of a social choice fund. The method was part of an effort to prove that the movement could quantify support for its cause. To that end, RI secured 450 donations.
“Our theory of change was if we show the administration the broad support on campus, then the University, having seen the withheld money and the massive support from people, would create the social choice fund,” Wohns said.
Sheehy-Skeffington said she believes the activist’s choice of whether to work within or outside of the system is culturally rooted. Reflecting on the differences between student activism in her home country of Ireland and in the United States, she suggested that Harvard students tend to seek to achieve change by working cooperatively within structures.
“I kind of buy the story that how people get to Harvard is they work really well within the system,” Sheehy-Skeffington said. “It’s part of the American ideology that you can work hard, get ahead, and you can get to the top and that’s how you change things.”
COMMUNITY SUPPORT
Occupy Harvard and the new activists both claimed success in achieving their movement’s goals. Occupy Harvard took credit when custodians negotiated a more favorable contract with the University in October 2011 and when Harvard announced in April 2012 that it would no longer reinvest in HEI Hotels & Resorts. Similarly, the activists who advocated more recently for a social choice fund claimed victory when the University announced the fund’s creation in December 2012. Though administrators ultimately acted on both of those issues, however, they did not specify that their changes were directly in response to student activist efforts.
While it is unclear what effect, if any, either Occupy Harvard or the new movements have had in influencing policy, this year’s activism has gained greater community support.
First, the organizers of the referenda were able to accumulate the number of student signatures necessary to include their topics as referendum subjects on the UC ballot. When these referenda went before voters in the Undergraduate Council election last November, all three passed by significant support: 72 percent of student voters supported divesting University funds from the fossil fuel industry, 80.5 percent voted to establish a social choice fund, and 85 percent wanted to reconsider the College’s sexual assault policies.
And although administrators have indicated that they will not divest from fossil fuel companies, they did grant divestment advocates sit-down meetings with University President Drew G. Faust and members of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body—two conversations that Occupy Harvard protesters were never granted. While Welton acknowledged that conversation does not necessarily translate into results, divestment activists have claimed that the meetings are a step in the right direction.
In this landscape, students say, the tents of Occupy Harvard are a distant memory.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the past two weeks, I’ve been watching Tercentenary Theatre transform. During the school year, that historical quadrangle—home to the ivory tower of Memorial Church and the stately columns of Widener Library—is flooded with the creatures of Harvard’s present, from undergraduates to grad students to esteemed faculty to excitable tourists and feisty squirrels. But for the past two weeks, the Theatre has been transforming piece by piece into something timeless, something full of ritual—a place that reminds us of its deep history and the immense grandeur of this university we call home. Yesterday, a few thousand chairs were imported. The day before, a series of enormous light fixtures were secured. A stage is forthcoming. And as the Theatre changes, so too does our relationship to Harvard. When we cross that recently assembled stage, we go from being part of Harvard’s present to part of its illustrious past. Likewise, Harvard becomes a completed stage in our unfolding lives.
This school will never leave us. But how can we successfully transition from being here to having been here? As the Memories chair of the Senior Class Committee, I worry a lot about preserving memories. I sometimes worry that I won’t remember what it felt like to arrive at Freshman Formal, to tear up the floor in an Expressions Dance Company show, to race into lecture seven minutes late, to work in Quincy Dining Hall ’til sunrise, or to pick up compers for Crimson Grand Elections. As new experiences wash over us, how can we keep these memories alive, so that we remember all the beautiful things we’ve learned at this school? I had the same concern when I left India, where I was fortunate enough to spend two months last summer: How can I draw on what I’ve learned and felt here, I thought, even when I’m nestled back in my New Quincy dorm?
Well, I’ve learned there are a few things you can always take with you. One is people. I have Indian food with the friends I traveled with in India several times a month, and I see most of them much more frequently than that. We reminisce, we reflect—but mostly we just live and continue to grow together. We became friends because of shared experiences, but we’ll stay friends because we have woven ourselves into each other’s lives. We must do the same thing with our friends here. In a few years, Harvard will only be how we met, not why we’re friends. We must prioritize our friendships and grow together, enriching our lives with the diverse and open and brilliant people we befriended here.
Other things we can take away are confidence, inspiration, and the innumerable lessons about life and ourselves we’ve learned here. While at Harvard, I learned how to traverse Boston on foot. How to foster community during an emergency. How to read long books. And old books. And children’s books. How to filter my gmail. How the universe was (probably) created. The difference between horror and terror (shout-out to Professor Kaiser.) How much impact a group of passionate students can have. How immense the challenges faced by our generation will be. How to build a set. How to dance like a Bollywood star. That Legally Blonde is the most fun musical ever created. How to deconstruct social construction. And that Quincy is the Best House. Ever. These realizations and lessons and this accumulated confidence to try new things and take risks will continue to be part of us, informing our actions and decisions and abilities.
I’m going to miss so much about our lives here. The intellectual curiosity radiating all around us. The way you can throw four girls in a room in Pennypacker and create lifelong friendships. The fact that you’re never more than ten feet away from someone who can teach you guitar or make an iMovie or speak six languages. What else can we take with us as we lose our dining hall and library privileges, our access to unbelievably talented faculty, our proximity to the teeming, vibrant, communities where anything is possible?
Let’s take our memories, but let’s take more than that. Let’s take our friends. Let’s take our skills. Let’s take our enhanced knowledge of what makes us tick—what makes us happy, sad, stressed, curious. Let’s be inspired to create communities as strong and beautiful as the ones we’ve inhabited here, and to improve the world with all we’ve gained. Let’s cross that stage in Tercentenary Theatre, leaving behind a bit of ourselves in Harvard’s past (and Harvard’s Archives—I see you thesis!) but also taking away as much as we can, bringing our Harvard experience into the world and into the future. Enter to Grow in Wisdom. We did. Depart to Serve Better Thy Country and Thy Kind. Let’s do it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The financial crisis, a cheating scandal, an encampment of protesters in Harvard Yard—events have shaped the presidency of Drew G. Faust.
“Happily we haven’t had a Civil War, you know,” Faust said, referencing the defining event of Abraham Lincoln’s presidency.
A subject of Faust’s historical scholarship, Lincoln famously described his presidency as a response to circumstance. “I claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me,” he said.
Referencing that remark, Faust said she saw similarities between her presidency and the turbulent times it has seen and Lincoln’s time in office.
“I think that’s an important part of being president from 2007 to...2013,” she said. “Events have had a big role.”
In many ways, Faust was the perfect candidate to face the difficult events of her tenure thus far. A consummate listener and observer, Faust addressed the ideas and concerns of her predecessors and colleagues, responding in a way that has carried her through the storm.
“It’s not me coming in and announcing some set of ‘Drew Faust’ ideas plucked from out of the sky,” Faust said. “It’s rather trying to translate everything I’m hearing into a program that reflects the insights of people in the community.”
But by continuing her predecessors’ missions, her input-driven leadership style has made her vision­—including the central concept of ”One University”—an amalgamation of the feedback of Harvard community members and the ideas of her predecessors.
While her style has worked during tumultuous times for both the University and the world, it remains to be seen whether she can use her renowned communication skills to renew and refine inherited ideas and lead Harvard through an ambitious, 21st-century capital campaign.
VISION WITHOUT VOLATILITY
When former University President Lawrence H. Summers resigned from his post in 2006 under pressure from members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, marking the shortest tenure of a Harvard president since the United States Civil War, Harvard’s central administration faced a community still reeling from the controversy surrounding Summers’s presidency.
Looking for a safe choice who could pull together the various interests within the faculty while also continuing many of Summers’ landmark endeavors, the University’s governing bodies picked the dean of a little-known Harvard research institute.
Faust, then-Dean of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, was celebrated for her ability to forge connections between faculty members and cater to their needs—a skill that eluded Summers.
Director of the Mahindra Humanities Center Homi K. Bhabha, who served as a senior advisor in the humanities at Radcliffe, said that Faust’s communication skills enabled her to facilitate partnerships between scholars in different fields.
“The reason why she was able to transform Radcliffe Institute was the fact that she was a very good listener to the constituencies that formed Radcliffe,” Bhabha said of Faust’s role in crafting the Institute’s programs.
Faust herself said that she considers responsiveness a fundamental component of leadership. “The way I understand leadership is a combination of listening and responding,” she said.
The selection of Faust also demonstrated an underlying push for a less polarizing leader.
“I believe that the Corporation had in mind that Larry Summers should shake things up,” said Peter L. Malkin ’55, a real estate mogul and long-time Harvard donor. “The Board of Overseers and the Corporation had in mind that she should bring them back together again.”
In addition to securing a leader with communication skills, Harvard’s governing boards sought someone who would continue her predecessor’s efforts to unify research and learning across schools.
“Most of us—certainly on the governing boards—feel that the priorities that Larry Summers articulated are still the ones that we should focus on,” Nannerl O. Keohane, a member of the Corporation, told The Crimson shortly after Faust was confirmed as University president in February 2007. “We wanted the same sort of vision, and we would have been really worried if we had a candidate who had come in and said that their priorities were 180 degrees in the opposite direction.”
“One University” was a key initiative as Summers pursued a more unified, cohesive Harvard.
“Harvard must—we must—cross over,” he said in his 2006 commencement speech, the final address of his presidency. “Cross over from old disciplines to new; cross over from old structures of governance to new; cross over from outdated lectures to new active modes of learning; cross over from the confines of Harvard Square and put down new, ambitious stakes, in Allston and beyond.”
The unification message resonated with Faust even before she became president. Leading the Radcliffe Institute—which did not have its own faculty at the time—required her to reach across different parts of the University to create “intellectual opportunities and synergies,” she said.
Bhabha, who joined forces with Faust to lead a faculty seminar on “cultural citizenship” during her time at Radcliffe, said that the seminar brought together faculty members from various schools across Harvard and was a “very informal intimation of the ‘One University’ idea.”
“You can see her vision as being to integrate the University,” said Bhabha of Faust’s leadership as Radcliffe Dean and later as University President.
Looking back, Faust said the concept of “One University” was “a seed planted” during her tenure as Radcliffe Dean, one that has “taken on a whole new set of understandings, expressions, [and] elaborations” from her vantage point as University President.
Since becoming president, Faust has repeatedly stated a commitment to unification, saying that her presidency has focused on “building connections and breaking down boundaries.” Several centralizing and interdisciplinary initiatives, from unifying the Harvard Library to creating the inter-faculty Harvard Global Health Institute, have characterized her time in Massachusetts Hall. Moreover, she has espoused and executed the priorities set by Summers, such as reforming corporate governance, improving financial aid, and overseeing development in Allston.
Today, Faust continues to push this vision, now seen as a central part of her administration.
Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 immediately turned to “One University” when asked to define Faust’s vision.
“I think that’s been a very powerful message of hers, and she’s worked consistently toward that goal,” Garber said.
While he praised Faust’s commitment, Malkin said that unification had been the central administration’s goal in the administrations of former Presidents Summers and Neil L. Rudenstine.
“I think it’s not [a goal] that originated with President Faust,” Malkin said. “I think that Larry Summers certainly had that as a major goal, and perhaps Neil had to a lesser extent.”
Even Derek C. Bok—the president before Rudenstine and the acting president after Summers’s resignation—instituted a University-wide calendar during his year-long second stint in Massachusetts Hall.
With a unification effort already in full force, Summers’s exit left Massachusetts Hall with direction but without stability.
SETTLING DOWN, STRAIGHTENING OUT
Of the events that made Faust, the financial crisis may have been the most significant.
“Any vision in 2013 has to be one that operates within a set of acknowledged constraints,” she said in reference to the collapse.
That pragmatic view of University priorities developed unexpectedly, but fit Faust far more than Summers’s idealism. “It’s had a huge influence on the University—the world,” Faust said. “It’s undeniable.”
Malkin said that he thought the financial crisis and other difficulties of the past several years have made Faust’s job especially hard.
“I think that she inherited this situation that was much more complicated than she ever could imagine,” Malkin said. “And I think that in light of the problems that did arise, particularly with the endowment, but also other things that have occurred, it has made her job extremely difficult.”
But a commitment to a unified University survived not only a change in presidency, but also the Great Recession. In fact, Faust said that in some ways, the crash made unification more urgent.
“If there are ways that we can share certain processes, certain activities—look more holistically at what we’re doing as a University—that is consistent with what we need to be doing in the face of what’s happened,” she said.
Though the idea is older than a decade, a more unified University remains a desire of many in the Harvard community. For Faust, unification is less a visionary goal and more a product of input from the Harvard community and prior administrations.
“What we’ve heard over and over again from our faculty, from our students, from our alumni, is that Harvard is or can be greater than the sum of its parts,” Garber said.
Faust has developed an image as a consummate listener, a profile that has made her an approachable figure for those voicing opinions.
“I have the feeling that if I needed to talk to her, that I could get in and talk to her,” said Gary Urton, chair of the anthropology department. “And I feel that she would listen.”
Faust’s penchant for translating voices from across the community into University programming is especially notable when contrasted with the style of her predecessor, who was known for bold visions that did not necessarily attain consensus support.
“Summers led by confronting the faculty and community with his views,” Bhabha said. “He led from the front so to speak.”
In contrast, Bhabha described Faust as someone who “sees leadership as something whereby she is careful to pull the whole faculty with her.”
A NEW PUSH
With the Summers presidency in the University’s rearview mirror, and the financial crisis nearly past, the attention of Harvard’s central administration has taken a dramatic turn from dealing with financial meltdown to embarking on what many predict will be the biggest capital campaign ever by an institution of higher education.
Until now, events have shaped the Faust presidency. But the campaign’s September launch will force her to take control of them. In leading Harvard through a record-breaking drive, Faust’s ability to communicate with faculty and donors alike will undoubtedly be key.
“Nobody can take the place of a president in delivering a message as to why you should give money. Harvard has that president,” said John A. Kaneb ’56, a prominent donor who also serves on Harvard Medical School’s Board of Fellows. “[Faust has] a god-given ability to put people at ease without even trying—she does naturally. I’ve seen her do it. She did it to me.”
But Faust’s job will extend beyond communicating as the campaign challenges her to inspire donors with the specifics of a more-than-decade-old vision applied to today’s Harvard.
“I think that on the one hand, one hopes that her vision and her leadership will lead to the kind of support that’s necessary for the campaign,” Malkin said. “And on the other hand, the degree to which the campaign is successful—rightly or wrongly—will have a large measure in the evaluation of how successful she has been.”
Faust’s approach to the campaign, like her approach to her presidency, has relied on themes of the past.
According to long-time donor and venture capitalist Sidney R. Knafel ’52, the one university concept also drove Harvard’s last campaign, headed by Rudenstine in the 1990s. The campaign, which was Harvard’s first University-wide campaign, raised a total $2.6 billion—a massive sum at the time.
“[The upcoming campaign] isn’t the first effort to present Harvard as one university,” Knafel said, adding that the he predicts The Harvard Campaign will be more successful in that regard than the 1990s drive.
Still, he said, “They wouldn’t be functioning as collaboratively and collegiately [now] as they are if they hadn’t gone through the training ground of that [1990s] campaign.”
Building on this foundation, Faust must adjust the broad vision of unification to today’s world. Some of her announced initiatives include the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences’ move across the river to Allston and funding HarvardX, Harvard’s branch of the virtual learning initiative edX that brings online courses to anyone in the world for free.
Still, much is left to flesh out.
“President Faust articulates a wonderful communal vision of the University’s mission,” history professor Charles S. Maier ’60 wrote in an email. “But how it will translate into actual institutional initiatives, whether internationalization or edX or the allocation of resources, still remains less specified.”
This ability to articulate goals is important, according to former Provost Harvey V. Fineberg ’67—a major fundraiser in the University’s last campaign.
“It’s essential, because the president represents a singular voice,” said Fineberg, who argued that in capital campaigns the president of any institution holds the effort together.
Calls for a clear statement of goals have been joined by demands for a bolder vision altogether.
Graduate School of Education professor Howard E. Gardner ’65, who knows Faust well, said that her reticence is likely a result of the brashness that many say characterized Summers’s presidency and ultimately led to its undoing.
“We want [a strong position] from leaders; we want to know what you are willing to go to the mat for, what is important to you,” Gardner said. “I think by nature she is a private person, but also she saw what happened in the previous administration.”
Faust now faces what may be a defining moment in her presidency.
“She is the face of the campaign,” said Richard P. Chait, an Education School professor who studies higher education governance. “You can see what the priorities are; you can infer what the vision will be. In an odd way, it’s both a test of substance of the campaign and a test of the president.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a plane on my way back to Harvard for the last time as an undergraduate student, I found myself reading for pleasure for the first time in a long time. The book was The Marriage Plot, by Jeffrey Eugenides. The storyline follows three students in their last days at Brown as they lament the loss of the marriage plot in modern English literature, their freedom, their time in college, and their youth. Although this is naturally relatable to me, what struck me was not the descriptions of the commencement proceedings, the regalia, the sentimentality of leaving college behind, but a disturbingly realistic passage describing Leonard’s first depressive episode.
My first encounter with depression was not sudden, but it was surprising. I was shocked, awed, confused, guilty and incredibly disappointed when I found myself crying for no reason my freshman spring. When my doctor back home prescribed me antidepressants, I almost took pleasure in it; antidepressants justified my self-loathing, my flirtation with the melancholy, the emptiness I had come to know.
That was my courtship with depression.
The marriage came that summer. It was July in Missouri and the heat and humidity that I felt physically seemed to also mimic the stifling, thick, impenetrable mass that had developed in my brain. I spent days in bed, sobbing, unable to move, questioning whether or not I even wanted to live anymore. My parents—amazing as they are and always will be—had to come to my room at all hours of the night to hug me, just sit beside me at 5 a.m. until I stopped crying from sheer exhaustion and finally fell asleep, only to awake a few hours later and again meekly call for them to come remind me that I was still human. I got used to spending hours at my summer internship crying in a bathroom stall, or with my nose pressed against the glass, wondering if the fall from the parking garage across the street could really kill me.
This was my marriage to the illness. As with any good marriage, our relationship is going strong.
Fast forward two or three years. A summer with a shrink who talked only of how perfect his own children were, several nights spent with friends comforting me and lovingly yet firmly taking knives from my hands, a trip to McLean Hospital in Belmont (“Where I would want my daughter to go,” the woman at UHS told me as I was escorted by police officers into the back of an ambulance), several medication changes, a psychiatrist in Boston I grew to love, brushes with the ecstatic and wonderful throes of mania, more medications, and countless nights spent trying to avoid the thoughts that frightened me, I am now graduating.
The diploma I will receive today, however wonderful it may be, is in no way indicative of what I have accomplished in my four years here, of my victories in the war against my own biology. It is not indicative of how hard I have had to work to stay alive, how hard I have had to work to get out of bed, put on a decent face to avoid suspicion and go to class.
It is not indicative of how I’ve managed with only the help of my wonderful friends and family—after the five minute conversation that led to my forced confinement in McLean and the resulting contracts I had to sign to just return to campus, the administration checked on me once to make sure I had “recovered.”
It is not indicative of how mentally ill Harvard students have an entire underground struggle to deal with on top of trying to continue extracurricular commitments to grasp for a feeling of normalcy, to attempt to break the monotony of the numbness that becomes pervasive in every waking moment.
Mostly, it is not indicative of what we are capable of or who we are. I am proud to have survived my most serious bouts of depression to date with little more than a few scars. I am proud to be someone who has beaten the odds given to me by the administration and triumphed.
Mentally ill students at Harvard may not have the traditional graduation plot, but ours is all the more spectacular for that reason.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After painstakingly handling the proceedings of the most high-profile academic integrity investigations in Harvard’s history, the College’s resident deans found themselves at the center of another public scandal this spring. But this time, they, and not their students, were the objects of scrutiny.
Revelations that administrators had conducted two sets of secret searches of resident deans’ email accounts to try to identify the source of a leak of information on the cheating case garnered international media attention, casting the deans into the public spotlight.
For some, the searches represented not just an invasion of privacy, but also the idea that resident deans are treated as second-rate administrators who are not afforded the same respect as faculty.
“It has been particularly dispiriting, then, not only to learn that we were subject to this search but to learn that as a result, our very legitimacy at the College is being questioned,” Senior Resident Dean Sharon L. Howell wrote in an open letter to University President Drew G. Faust in March.
The resident deans hold a dual role within the framework of the College, interacting with students both as academic instructors and as House-level advisers. Current and former administrators say that over the past several decades the position has evolved from a role that drew an equal balance between scholarly and administrative work into a job that entails a sometimes overwhelming list of bureaucratic duties.
When Howell penned her letter to Faust, she articulated frustration about an unresolved question that has lingered for decades in the corridors of the Houses—where do resident deans fit in the increasingly complex maze of the administration of Harvard College?
COLLEGIAL COMPANIONS
House deans first moved into the Houses in 1952, on the recommendation of then-Dean of the College Wilbur J. Bender ’27. He envisioned the deanship, soon christened the “Allston Burr Senior Tutor” in honor of a wealthy benefactor to the University, as a half-time advising job for senior faculty that would give students more immediate access to academic guidance.
Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67, who served as senior tutor in Leverett House from 1978 to 1987 and of Dudley House from 1992 to 2005, recalled that the primary capacity of the role during his early days at Harvard was to guide students’ intellectual trajectory.
“I think the hope was you would attract tutors, who would come in and share their work with students, and serve as important mentors,” Dingman said.
As respected academics, the senior tutors maintained close personal relationships with both students and top administrators, according to folklore and mythology head tutor Deborah D. Foster, who served as senior tutor in Currier from 1989 to 1995.
“My relationship with the House Masters and the Dean of the College was completely and utterly collegial,” she said, recalling that senior tutors regularly called then-Dean of the College L. Fred Jewett ’57 to ask for advice.
BUREACRATIC BURDEN
Today, several current and former administrators said, resident deans occupy a noticeably different position, defined by an increased administrative workload. For resident deans, that means more paperwork, more correspondence, more meetings, and more responsibilities on top of their existing scholarly commitments.
Some former House officials say this change can be partly attributed to the increased centralization of the College administration. In the 1990s, they say, administrators made a conscious effort to absorb resident deans into an increasingly hierarchical College.
“There was kind of a demand that everything be bureaucratized and centralized,” said Stephen A. Mitchell, a professor of Scandinavian and folklore who served as the Master of Eliot House from 1991 to 2000.
In a 1994 report, a committee composed of faculty and administrators clarified the role of the senior tutor as an administrator called on to enforce academic policy in a “uniform fashion” while reporting directly to the Dean of the College.
The report, whose recommendations were largely embraced by a vote of the faculty, elaborated a clear standard for the division of duties between senior tutors and Masters.
“The Master is responsible for the House as a whole and the community it creates; the [Senior] Tutor for the welfare of individual students resident within the House,” the report stated.
While not inherently unreasonable, this strict separation of roles could damage the relationship between Tutors and Masters when taken to extremes, Mitchell said, potentially contributing to a “perception that somehow House Masters were meant to bribe students with food and drink at receptions...and the intellectual, specific student welfare was the responsibility of the resident dean.”
According to former Leverett House Master John E. Dowling ’57, the creation of new deanships and offices outside of the Houses drove this trend.
“There’s no question that University Hall has taken a lot of the responsibility of running a House from the Masters and assumed it for University Hall, and I don’t think that’s a good thing frankly,” Dowling said.
However, this greater oversight has not always translated to close relationships between resident deans and top administrators, some said.
“Because of the nature of how this year has been, I just haven’t gotten to know [Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds] as an academic in the way I would actually like to,” said Cabot House Resident Dean Emily W. Stokes-Rees, adding that her interactions with the dean in the past year have been limited primarily to formal Ad Board meetings.
But even in a more typical year, Stokes-Rees said, heavy workloads on both ends would likely make frequent contact impractical.
“Just in terms of the things she deals with in her day-to-day work, I think it would be unreasonable with the amount that she has to do and the amount that we have to do that we would be corresponding all the time,” Stokes-Rees mused, adding that she interacts much more frequently with some of Hammonds’s associate deans.
Of the 13 resident deans in upperclassman Houses, only Howell and Stokes-Rees agreed to be interviewed for this story. The other 11 declined or did not respond to requests for comment on this story.
A MORE DIVERSE SET OF CHARGES
Some point to the growing diversity of the student body to explain the changed role of the resident dean.
Efforts in the past few decades to broaden racial, gender, socioeconomic, and geographical representation at the College have brought to Harvard a more heterogeneous student body with a more varied background, Dingman said. These students require more attention to guide them through college life, he added, in turn demanding more time from administrators in the Houses.
House administrators said that in recent decades a greater awareness of issues like student stress, mental health, and concussions has added to the administrative caseload of resident deans, who are charged with connecting students to the appropriate resources.
And as the nature of the resident dean’s work changes, the perception of the position has also changed, they said.
“[The academic responsibilities have] become less and less part of our public profile because we’ve been given a lot more case-management counseling and crisis management,” Howell said.
Still, Stokes-Rees and Howell were quick to emphasize that they get great joy from this type of work with students.
In fact, they said, the email searches upset them precisely because of how much they value the welfare of undergraduates. The searches identified a resident dean who had forwarded an internal advising email to students implicated in the Government 1310 cheating case that eventually made its way to the media. After administrators said that the searches were intended to protect student privacy, Howell wrote in her letter that they implicitly suggested that resident deans could not be trusted.
“This charge is something we take extremely seriously—it is a privilege to contribute so immediately and substantively to the lives of these extraordinary students,” Howell wrote in the letter.
CALLING FOR BALANCE
Resident deans have been concerned about the shrinking role of academic mentorship in their perceived job description, according to Howell.
After Suzy M. Nelson was appointed associate dean of residential life in 2005, senior tutors were made to report directly to her instead of directly to the Dean of the College as they had traditionally done. This left many tutors with lingering concerns about working through a non-academic office largely unrelated to their role as faculty members, said Howell.
This shift towards the primacy of the administrative role was emphasized in 2006, when the senior tutors were renamed “Allston Burr Resident Deans.” This name change reflected the shift from academic mentor to live-in administrator, according to Mitchell, implying “a bureaucratic relationship to the House,” he said.
In contrast, three policies implemented at the recommendation of a 2009 report swung the pendulum back toward the original conception of the resident dean as academic mentor. Those changes shifted oversight of resident deans back to the Dean of the College, extended term limits for resident deans to allow them to pursue tenure-track positions, and required resident deans to have Ph.D.s.
Howell reiterated that while she values her non-academic advising duties, she hopes this recent trend will continue. Going forward, she said, resident deans should be able to devote more time to talking with students about their intellectual life.
“We do need to find a better balance in order for the resident deans to achieve their potential in the Houses,” Howell said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than a few decades have passed since I was in your shoes, but I remember like it was yesterday the nightmare I had the night before my own graduation from Harvard College. In it, my classmates are about to graduate and celebrate the next phases of their lives, when I suddenly realize I have missed my last final exam. Fortunately for me, I awoke to find it was only a dream. My reality was not unlike all of yours today—four years of late-night studying, piles of library books, times with friends, and hours spent on extra-curricular activities and in team practices culminated in a hard-earned diploma, with hopes and dreams to follow.
Much has changed since my years at Harvard and my time as Editorial Chair of the Harvard Crimson. I imagine few of you have ever tried to write a term paper or a newspaper column on a typewriter! That being said, some things—educational excellence and integrity, service to community and country, and good citizenship—stay the same. Commencement is a moment to celebrate some of these unchanging constants.
One thing I have learned about your generation—and from my own children, who are about your age—is that you reject the notion of fitting into some sort of pre-set mold. You are trailblazers and ceiling breakers—an attitude that will serve this nation well. As you are all fully aware, our country faces big challenges and we can all feel reassured knowing that you will take them on with characteristic determination.
But there is one sacred tradition that I ask you to keep. This is a tradition deeply engrained not only in Harvard, but also in the roots of our nation. Americans of all generations have a compact with each other, a uniquely American compact, renewed and reaffirmed since the founding of our country: Each generation leaves a better nation for the one to follow. A better America—not only richer materially, but more just, stronger, richer culturally. It is a bond of shared responsibility.
My parents' generation defeated fascism in Europe and came home to build the Interstate Highway System, launch the space program, and break down racial and religious barriers, leaving a better America. It is what my generation must do for you, and what you must do as well.
I chose public service for this very reason. And today I believe my generation owes you more—in areas like student loan debt and support for veterans returning from the longest military conflict in our nation’s history. You deserve to raise your families in communities that do not have to worry about gun violence and school safety, or the growing threat of a changing climate with more frequent and severe weather. You deserve an economy that offers you fulfilling job opportunities, and the possibility of a secure retirement—someday long into the future.
My generation still has a lot of work to do to make good on our compact, but I promise you I will never stop working to achieve those goals.  In the meantime, I look forward to watching you—whom I firmly believe to be our next "greatest generation" of American leaders.  With all that you will accomplish for yourselves, I urge you to remember to think also of the generations to come.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During high school, many of us were used to being big fish in a small pond. Once we arrived on campus, we were quick to realize that we were really just guppies. Although any college experience may lead students to reassess and find themselves, with the academic rigor and the intensity and talent of the student body, Harvard can be a pressure cooker if we don’t know how to find success after failure. This is a good time to commemorate the things that have led us to graduation and reflect on how challenges and setbacks have led us to current and future triumphs.
Harvard students may pass through the five stages of “humbling” during their years on campus. I’ve modeled the Harvard “Humbling” process to the Kubler-Ross five stages of grief. Though we are very familiar with the early stages of excitement to be at Harvard and recognition of stiffness of “competition,” we can sometimes remain stagnant, or move on without processing and growing from the lessons we are lucky to learn, ahead of the real-world schedule.
Flash back four years, to the day you arrived at Harvard. Here, we enter Stage One—Excitement. We are overwhelmed with the amount of activity and the caliber of our fellow classmates. Which club should you join? Which PBHA or IOP program do you envision yourself running by the next year?
Study cards are turned in, Ec 10 has sealed your fate for freshman year, you have attended 15 intro meetings for various organizations, and you are realizing that you probably won’t be partying much this year. Enter Stage Two—Disappointment/ Intimidation. The esteemed faculty, famous lecturers, and incredible classmates may make you feel out of your element. Maybe you find that you can’t brag to the person sitting next to you at the dinner table about the trip you took to vaccinate orphans in a war-torn country, because chances are that person discovered the vaccine or wrote a book about their experience doing the same thing. Attempts to get involved, find leadership positions, and continue with pre-college passions may result in disappointment when your ideas, applications, and efforts are not selected or rewarded. You start to see the tip of the iceberg of work, of hierarchical ladders you would have to climb alongside other students to reach the leadership position you eyed, the effort-laden coolness you had to exude to navigate weird social processes.
Stage Three—Self-doubt. Intimidation may take root and you may find that you constantly compare your achievements to those of your peers. Maybe your resume isn’t really that impressive. Everyone is talking about how busy they are and which summer job to choose. Why did she get an offer at Morgan Stanley? Do you even stand a chance? Someone else is always smarter, better, more capable, more creative.
Stage 4—Recovery. Slowly, you start to realize that you are not alone in feeling intimidated and rudderless. Sometime around junior year, you (hopefully) realize your doubts are shared by a great many of your peers, and you are relieved. You have time to process the academic pressures and extracurricular opportunities, and your performance, progress and mood improve. You make time for the things that you are passionate about, not just items for a resume. FOMO (fear-of-missing-out) is no longer overwhelming (save for Senior Spring); you feel freed from continuing to be a member of the organization you have been invested in but no longer enjoy. We all start in unique ways to come into our own, regardless of occasional disappointments and sporadic pangs of inadequacy.
Stage 5—Humbled by Harvard. Eventually humility becomes a constant companion. In fact, we learn that humility is not just experienced in the presence of the rich and famous, or the Nobel-prize recipient or your prominent professor, but also where you never expected, in the presence of the man pursuing his passion playing music on that obscure instrument in the Square, the lunch lady who personally greets everyone as she swipes their card, the child you tutor through PBHA, or the student that tutors you. We strengthen our strides this way—from admitting we are not perfect to recognizing we have much to learn from everyone. We progress from helping each other up as well, with the knowledge that we will all eventually need another hand to get us on our feet again.
If we put our successes and disappointments in the proper context, we might just be prepared to find real success outside the Harvard bubble. It is no easy feat reaching stage five and making it, cap and gown, to Harvard’s graduation. After four years of figuring it out, congratulations and welcome to stage five, Class of 2013!
Meredith C. Baker ’13, a former Crimson editorial columnist, is a social studies concentrator in Eliot House. She wrote a similar article for The Crimson after the first semester of freshman year. It has been revisited and revised to include all four years, to better illustrate ‘humbling” at Harvard and how perceptions of our time here can change from freshman to senior year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I first left my native Kenya in 1973, when I came to the United States to attend Harvard College. In Kenya, as a young man of South Asian ancestry, I was considered “Asian.” But since my ancestors had lived in Africa for nearly two centuries, I considered myself African as well. At Harvard, however, many of my peers were quick to question my identity. Since my family had origins in South Asia, rather than in East Asia, they argued that I could not be “Asian.” And, not being black, they proclaimed that I could not be African either!
Looking back, I believe these troubling conversations stemmed from the great lack of diversity at Harvard during that time, as well as from a pervasive, myopic worldview. Only a few non-white students were admitted to my class, and international students such as myself were few and far between. Study abroad for undergraduates was rare if not taboo.
After graduating, I pursued my doctoral studies at Harvard, and ultimately joined the faculty. Happily, during my many years here, I have not only seen global education expand, but the demographics of the College gradually diversify. Thus, while I have benefited from this institution’s immense resources—symbolized by its world-class collections and staggering endowment—I have come to believe that perhaps our greatest resource lies in each other. Indeed, the diversity of this year’s graduating class, built as it is from the youth of many nations—bolstered by many backgrounds, perspectives, races, and identities—constitutes an opportunity for dialogue and learning that would have been unthinkable in 1973. Perhaps more than an Ivy League education, and certainly more than the slip of paper that acknowledges it, the lessons that this class has learned from its own diversity will empower it to succeed in, and contribute to, the wider world.
It is often said that Harvard is a bubble. In many ways this is very true; Harvard’s intense concentration of diversity has few parallels. The ethos here, too, which valorizes difference and learning from difference is distinctive. Sadly, in looking beyond our ivory tower we see that respect for diversity such as we are increasingly cultivating at Harvard is not as common as it should be. We see that the inability to accept difference leads, all too often, to expressions of violence aimed at humiliating, marginalizing, and eliminating “the other.” Indeed, many recent tragedies are tied to this failure; the Holocaust, together with more recent tragedies in Rwanda, Bosnia, and elsewhere, are among the most devastating examples. In our own country, too, though we ostensibly embrace “e pluribus unum,” our history has been marked by structural and institutional subjugation of communities considered to be the “other”—be they Native American, African American, Japanese American, Latin American, or, more recently, Muslim American. I would argue that such systemic oppression also constitutes a form of violence. Similar campaigns of violence exist throughout the world, and are usually founded on the fallacy that a nation-state should be mono-cultural, mono-religious, and mono-lingual. In the modern period especially, this model is dangerously antiquated, for through its citizens every nation experiences difference, though few address it and learn from it. In this regard, learning from difference is a key challenge in our increasingly polarized world.
Of course, I do not mean to imply that Harvard is perfect in addressing issues of diversity. Certainly it has more ground to cover. But I do hope that during their time here Harvard students will have caught a glimpse of the road that we should be following. They have seen that understanding, respecting, and embracing difference is among the first steps towards bringing about meaningful peace. Key in this endeavor, I think, is teaching about pluralism as some of my colleagues and I have tried to do in our courses. For me, pluralism is neither the elimination of difference nor merely the recognition of difference. As my colleague, Professor Diana L. Eck, aptly puts it, pluralism demands a conscious engagement with difference—that is, an active desire to understand and appreciate the contexts that make the “other” different.
Pluralism, unfortunately, does not come about naturally. It must be taught, reinforced, and enacted. Among the most critical dimensions of learning about pluralism is religious and cultural literacy, which is, sadly, one of the most neglected parts of education in this country, notwithstanding our unparalleled religious and cultural diversity. Globally, too, religious and cultural illiteracy is a serious problem; as a scholar of Islam, I consistently observe the damaging effects of sectarianism within many Muslim-majority countries caused by stereotypes and the political manipulation of religious symbols. I believe, however, that better understanding of, and respect for, difference through appropriate education can ensure stability within and among nations. Indeed, the well-being of democracy the world over depends on this.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I first read the article in New York Magazine about Yale’s self-proclaimed SWUGs—senior washed-up girls—I was appalled. Any feelings of empathy I had for the plight of my fellow female senior Ivy Leaguers drowned in a sea of revulsion at their willingness to wallow in being “washed up.” But this did not stop me from embracing the term whole-heartedly. Far from it. I started to use it in conversation, in texts, emails, and that most SWUGly form of communication, the snapchat. I derived a certain perverse pleasure from calling myself a SWUG, perhaps because, rather than seeming washed up to my peers, during my senior spring I felt like I was having more fun than any of them.
But my use of the term is not wholly ironic, despite my best efforts to make it seem that way. The truth is, Harvard has left me feeling somewhat washed up, but not in the way that the term’s original coiners meant. For me, this feeling of hollowness has more to do with a sense of lowered expectations than with being past one’s prime. I like to think that at 21 years old I have not passed my prime, but rather have yet to reach it. So why do I occasionally feel disillusioned when my hectic social agenda allows me some time for introspection?
I feel disillusioned because I am growing weary of never having romantic expectations for men. As a freshman girl, I was so caught up in the whirlwind of new people and surroundings that I did not stop to consider the nature of my interactions with my male peers. I almost assumed that any relationships I had would be fleeting and essentially meaningless because I was consumed by the business of being a freshman. There were always more people to meet, more parties to go to—or rather attempt to go to. But with each passing year and each new DAPA bottle I acquired, I started to question my interactions with college men a little more.
Why were my sexual interactions with them more often drunken than sober? Why was I so petrified to text them for fear of seeming “clingy?” I now realize that I had succumbed to the expectation of hyper-informality that enables the hook-up culture prevalent at Harvard and many other schools. Of course people do date here, but in my experience anything but the most casual of hook-ups is somewhat frowned upon. I have often heard the derisive question, “Are you still hooking up with so-and-so?” as if to suggest, “Are you really so lame that you haven’t yet moved on to your next conquest?” Friends accuse men and women alike of ceasing to be fun as soon as they embark on a serious relationship, and we all know that ceasing to be fun is tantamount to a social death sentence.
Why are college students so wary of serious relationships, and so critical of those who date seriously? Yes, it is college. Everyone is experimenting, everyone is trying to have fun. But I do not see why this necessarily stigmatises the desire to be in a serious or even a more than very casual relationship. Hyper-informality is great in the short term—you can have all the physical benefits without the emotional commitment. But in the long term it is profoundly unsatisfying.
More disturbing for me personally, the culture of hyper-informality has left me guarded. I am reluctant to allow myself to get to know someone intimately, for fear of falling for that person. It is a self-defence mechanism. If you have no expectations, your heart will not get broken. But I shouldn’t be going into the world being adept at putting up walls, yet poor at letting people in. At 21, I should be excited to fall in love, not afraid of getting my heart broken.
So despite my initial contempt for their movement, I owe the SWUGs of Yale a debt. They have forced me to take a long, hard look at the hook-up culture at Harvard in which I have participated. And what I see is a dilemma: We all want attention. We all want to be loved. Yet no one wants to be the one doling out attention and love to a significant other for fear of seeming “lame” or “soft.” But what’s wrong with showing that you care about someone? Last time I checked, that was kind of sexy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To the Harvard Class of 2013,
A few years ago, I had the honor of serving as a Fellow at Harvard’s famed Institute of Politics. I will never forget the experience Harvard offered me, and neither should you. The resources available here are unmatched throughout the country, giving you all the ability to fix our government and chart a new path for America.
How does a country remain forever young?  Can a nation remain vibrant if its government grows old, precluding the country’s ability to move ahead?
If we have learned anything the past few decades it is this: The way Washington is trying to fix things isn’t working—and it’s not because our politicians aren’t trying. They have tried to “plan” our way out of every problem imaginable.
They’ve tried to “plan” our way out of an education quagmire.  Instead, they have wasted a generation of American children, condemning them to face a changing world without hope or preparation. They’ve tried to “plan” more affordable health care but have only made it more expensive, less innovative and more uncertain. They’ve tried to “plan” for our retirement security but have left a growing group of seniors depending on the shrinking generations that will follow them. They’ve tried to “plan” for the future but Americans yet unborn are already wallowing in debt.
Most politicians I’ve been privileged to meet over the years in Washington, Democrats and Republicans, are good people. They are smart, courageous and work selflessly for the friends and neighbors who elected them.
The problem is not the sincerity of their intentions but the age of their ideas. This is not the worst they can do. This is the best they can do.  Despite their best efforts, they approach every problem with a big, top-down industrial-age plan, a tool that is out of date.
There once was a time when the uniformity dispensed by the American factory was the world’s most efficient means of production. It satisfied the needs of a growing and vital country. The assembly line, the cog and the gear, emblematic of standardized production, gave us not only the wonder of the automobile, but also the American middle class—the crowing achievement of the industrial age.
The factory was a miracle of progress.  And so we transferred that successful experiment to other social challenges.  We built a big, top-down factory in Washington with an assembly line to crank out policies and a conveyor belt to produce programs and a loading dock to deliver regulations.  And for a while, when the factory was young, everything seemed to work.
The G.I. bill.  Social Security.  Hoover Dam.  Big simple national projects harnessed the will of a nation and delivered on its promises and good intentions.
Over time, however, society grew more agile and moved more quickly. Its challenges grew increasingly interconnected and complex. Its demands bloomed exponentially. The pressure on government intensified, but factory could only do what factories do: It grew larger and cranked out more of the same.
It piled more regulation, policies and programs on top of old ones. It patched the problems and then, patched the patches. It grew muscular and then muscle-bound.
And so, today, we find ourselves in a world where everything has changed except our government. The factory is still doing its best, but in a hyper-connected, dynamic, communications age country, industrial-age government conformity can’t keep pace.  It is past its time.  In today’s America, old doesn’t work.
We have gone from the day of the top-down, unchanging encyclopedia to the age of bottom-up Wikipedia. We have moved from the conformity of Pabst Blue Ribbon to the choice and diversity of microbrews. We have gone from an age of gatekeeper newspapers to the open doors of the blogosphere. Our one-size-fits-all government, however, has been left behind, stuck in the age of standardization.
In an age of independence and personal empowerment, New Republicans are advancing something fresh:  bottom-up solutions instead of top-down uniformity. We believe our challenges will be addressed more effectively and compassionately in a more modern and natural way.
Item one on a New Republican Agenda is an open educational system, not a closed or zoned one, manipulated top-down by Washington.  Factory style schools have had their day. Republicans, unobligated to the top-down educational bureaucracy and teacher’s unions, can push for a bottom-up educational system that gives parents an equal opportunity to choose the best schools for their children. It puts the old, uniform approach of the educational establishment to shame.
Item two on a New Republican Agenda: Growing our economy naturally and organically, bottom-up.  We are past the old, political and artificial stimulus. Organic, not artificial growth, is the key to renewed and lasting prosperity. That means moving money and power out of Washington and out of the hands of the Washington elite—the well-intentioned managers on our capital’s factory floor. We must plant the seeds of growth, not in the sterile concrete of Washington, but in the fertile soil of the dynamic economy where real Americans live.
Item three on a New Republcian Agenda:  It’s time to re-boot Washington.  If we invented America’s government today, would we replicate what we have now?  Even David Axelrod admits our government is ungovernable.  He says, "There's so much beneath you that you can't know because the government is so vast."  The answer:  Let’s sell every other government building and send the vast and unknowable factory managers to the unemployment line.  Let’s start growing America’s economy instead of Washington’s economy.  New Republicans believe we should put America first.
Times have changed.  Our government hasn’t.  New Republicans believe we can fix that and, in so doing, make America young again. The government won’t be fixed by itself. It needs smart, young leaders to tackle the problems this nation currently faces. Together, we can do this. It is time to take responsibility for our country and come up with the innovative, bottom-up solutions this nation desperately needs.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rarely does a Ph.D. dissertation provoke a media storm. Most of these scholarly productions, the culmination of years of course work, research and writing, gather dust on library shelves and are read, if anyone reads them at all, by a handful of academics in the author’s field of study. And with good reason: Most dissertations are dry, poorly written, deal with narrow topics, and contribute little, if anything, to the existing literature on the topic they address.
One Kennedy School dissertation, however, has not only drawn media attention over the past week, but also resulted last Friday in the resignation of its author, Jason Richwine, by his employer, the Heritage Foundation, a conservative and influential “think tank” in Washington, D.C. Richwine first drew critical scrutiny as the co-author of a Heritage Foundation paper that estimated the cost (over 50 years) of granting citizenship to “illegal” immigrants in the United States at $6.3 trillion dollars, as these newly minted citizens become eligible for government benefits such as welfare, health care, and higher education.
Critics of the study quickly pounced on its rather dubious assumptions and extrapolations, prompting a Washington Post reporter to dig out Richwine’s dissertation, completed in 2009 and titled “IQ and Immigration Policy.” The Post article, featuring quotes from the dissertation that focused on Hispanics, both undocumented immigrants and their American-born children, instantly convinced Heritage Foundation leaders to distance themselves from Richwine’s dissertation and push him out the door.
What was so disturbing in this dissertation that has created such a furor? After all, it was approved by a committee of three distinguished Harvard professors—George J. Borjas, Richard J. Zeckhauser, and Christopher Jencks—who attested to its scholarly competence as meriting a Harvard Ph.D. Presumably, they guided Richwine’s research on his pre-approved topic and were sufficiently knowledgeable to spot any flaws in Richwine’s work. None of these academics, however, possessed any expertise in the fields of biology, psychology, or neurology, from which Richwine drew the data on which he based his assertion that non-Caucasians are doomed by genetics to possess and pass on to their children significantly lower IQs (as measured by standardized tests of mental ability) than native-born American whites, and that “the low average IQ of Hispanics is effectively permanent.”
Richwine, who lacks any degrees in these fields himself, offered no data in his dissertation (or research of his own) to support this claim, relying instead on studies, most of them highly disputed, that purported to link below-average IQs to such “underclass” traits as criminality, out-of-wedlock births, welfare dependency, psychosis, alcoholism, and even obesity and smoking. Low-IQ immigrants have low-IQ children, live in neighborhoods (Richwine refers to Hispanic “barrios” as breeding grounds for these traits) populated largely by other low-IQ people, and create a “culture” that is inimical to the American economy, depressing the earnings of native-born whites. Additionally, “intractable cultural differences” are preventing Mexican assimilation into white society.
Turning to immigration policy in his final dissertation chapter, Richwine identified the “salient policy issue” as “the well-documented persistence of the IQ deficit” among non-Caucasians (excepting Asians, whose larger “brain size” gives them above-average IQs). Given the “strong case for IQ selection” in screening potential legal immigrants, Richwine proposed administering IQ tests to those seeking admission to the United States. However, undoubtedly aware that his proposal would never find a political sponsor, he suggested the euphemistic term “skills” as more palatable. “The tests would still be ordinary intelligence tests, but the emotional baggage that the term IQ sometimes carries with it would be much reduced.” Richwine suggested that such tests could be administered at American embassies or consulates, or perhaps even over the Internet, although he shrank from proposing a “passing” score on such a test.
How could any self-respecting Harvard professor, one might ask, approve a dissertation that contains such racist nonsense? Three did, as noted above. In doing so, they certified that Richwine’s work “represents a significant contribution to knowledge” in the field of public policy—which is, after all, the requirement for dissertations in that field as stated in Harvard’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Handbook. Doctoral candidates at the Kennedy School of Government, the Handbook adds, are required to “demonstrate his or her ability to perform original research in an area of public policy” in their dissertation.
Richwine’s dissertation, in fact, included no “original research” conducted by him. It was based solely on secondary sources, heavily weighted toward studies with a hereditarian bias, dismissing works such as The Mismeasure of Man, a scathing critique of IQ testing by the late Stephen Jay Gould, professor of biology, geology, and paleontology at Harvard. Whether the dissertation made a “significant contribution to knowledge” in public policy is a subjective matter of scholarly judgment, although I would argue that it did not. It might pass muster as a master’s thesis, for which reliance on secondary sources, or “a review of the literature,” is commonly allowed in most graduate schools, as a prelude to “original research” for a dissertation. The fact that Richwine addressed a controversial topic is not an issue; there should be no “taboo” topics in academic work. The issue, and the point of this Open Letter to the Kennedy School faculty, is that adherence to the standards of the graduate school’s official Handbook needs to be enforced more rigorously in the approval of dissertations. My own modest proposal is that the faculty consider appointing a “devil’s advocate” for each candidate, as the Catholic church does to examine and question the purported “miracles” required for candidates for sainthood. Such advocates could be anonymous, and perhaps from another school, to better allow for critical analysis, since dissertation committees like Richwine’s are normally composed of professors who have personal ties to the candidate. After all, Richwine cited favorably in his dissertation the work of Professors Borjas and Jencks, possibly giving them a stake in his work.
I’m not proposing that the graduate faculty revoke Richwine’s doctorate or publicly disavow his dissertation, although Professor Zeckhauser recently stated that “Richwine was too eager to extrapolate his empirical results to inferences for policy.” Good advice, but a tad late. And Professor Borjas, an economist, says, “I have never worked on anything even remotely related to IQ,” the main topic of Richwine’s dissertation, adding that “the focus on IQ is a bit misguided.” Again, a tad late to help Richwine rethink his dissertation proposal, which Borjas had approved.
The media storm over Jason Richwine’s dissertation will soon subside, as he looks for a new employer. But the issue for the Kennedy School faculty over this episode will remain until the standards for dissertations are more rigorously enforced.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Today, over 1600 of us exit the Harvard Bubble to enter the Real World. It’s a popular saying. I think I’ve often said so myself, to others and internally. But what does it actually mean, and signify, when we delineate so much of our immediate future and, more fundamentally, the past four years on the existence of this Harvard Bubble? I won’t presume here to have come up with a magic-bullet explanation for the elusive nature of this oft-spoken omnipresence. Only, instead, to suggest that it’s worth considering for a moment what our sense of the Bubble projects onto our graduation today.
Recently, some friends and I found ourselves one afternoon having what probably stacks up as one of those standard last-week-at-Harvard-for-seniors conversations. A lot of it ended up centering on this very topic of bubbledom, and whether we who graduate today really enter the “real world” anymore than we already inhabit it. Toward the end, after a few minutes of sprawling dialogue and talking over each other, a state influenced no doubt by the excesses of senior week, one of us said (or said something along these lines): “I’m not denying the Harvard Bubble, I’m just skeptical that we don’t recreate bubbles wherever we go throughout our lives.” True enough, but surely, I thought, no hermetic seal can be greater than Harvard’s? Both so pristinely cleansed of everyday challenges faced by many right around us in an urban environment and populated by a tremendous diversity of students, Harvard assuredly makes the jump out of the high school and college cycle a pretty tremendous one.
I’ve always assumed that the Harvard Bubble existed in part because it’s talked about so much, thrown around so often. And I instinctively disagreed with a statement questioning the power of this institution to draw its students in and provoke interests and concerns that would otherwise not exist away from the loose parameter of a square mile around Widener Library. How often do you hear, “Oh wasn’t it great to go into Boston for a change, and get out of the Harvard Square Bubble?” Take the recent senior week trip to Six Flags—an early Sunday bus ride, rainy theme park, but another relished day-trip from this perceived parallel world in which we consciously seem to consume ourselves in our daily lives as undergraduates. I’ve also always been a party to the Bubble’s existence because life has a way of seeming so noticeably different whenever I do get away for more than a few hours—maybe to New York for a weekend, or home on vacation.
Harvard has a way of anaesthetizing powerfully, or trivializing, some aspects that are present in most parts of most peoples’ lives—what to make for dinner and how to afford it—while magnifying others, like the importance of defining ourselves as Harvard students by what we do outside of class, specifically the organizations we take part in. Harvard has always seemed in many ways, and for better or worse, an ordinary school, filled with the usual cliques and pressures, but I’m convinced we do take this particular form of competition to a degree seldom enjoyed by many.
Equally, it seems inescapably true, as my friend said that afternoon, that we surely—particularly those of us who are fortunate to graduate from elite colleges—recreate various bubbles in the “real world” that follows, and which Harvard mimics. The Harvard experience might be more sheltered, in its own way here in Cambridge, than living in the heart of a big city or going to work everyday. But maybe one of the strengths of such a mega-bubble as Harvard’s is to reveal itself more obviously to those encased within it. For all the truth to there being a real adult world pushed back by the luxuries and myriad opportunities of the past four years, Harvard’s campus also seems imbued with a fixation on money—not just attaining it but with the idea itself and those who have it—that resembles closely that of the metropolises that, as The Crimson’s senior survey suggests, most of us will move to but did not grow up in. In this sense, I suppose Harvard is not so different from the real world, or at least the real world that Harvard kids go on to experience.
I still think the Harvard Bubble exists, because Harvard is a good school and overall a nice place, and clearly not all of life is so easily pleasant, and because it seems the nature of campus-central colleges to become all-consuming for those who take part. All of this probably adds up to a confused mix-up of believing, quite strongly, in the Harvard Bubble, but equally being skeptical of some of the tropes thrown around about it, and no doubt repeating some others. I’m going to miss Harvard after today and wish I understood the nature of its bubble a little better; then I might feel more confident about understanding what we all leap into next. Maybe one path forward arises from one of this college’s greatest strengths, namely the amazing diversity of experiences on offer for every undergraduate who arrives here. One question could be, “What does it mean for each of us to leave our own Harvard Bubble?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the past year, students have taken to The Crimson, email chains, websites, and the campus’ grounds to discuss what can be done to address Harvard’s suicide rate and to improve the state of our community’s mental health more broadly. As we close this academic year—one in which students received three "Sad News" emails from administrators about the deaths of undergraduates, including one that said the death was a suicide—it is important to look back on our conversations and think about how we can formulate goals for the future of mental health at Harvard.
In our discussions, there is agreement that feelings of isolation and inadequacy among undergraduates must be addressed, as these sentiments are causes not only of suicide, but also of eating disorders, anxiety, self-injury, and other seemingly insurmountable obstacles. While acknowledgement of the issue is an important first step, the real question remains: How do we better shape our community to confront these underlying sentiments? There are two avenues through which we can approach the problem: institutional changes and cultural changes.
Much of the debate over the past two semesters has focused on institutional changes. Nevertheless, it is important to remember that Harvard already has an incredible array of mental health resources available to students. With Harvard Mental Health Services, the Bureau of Study Counsel, The Center for Wellness, five peer counseling groups, 35 chaplains, the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, proctors, PAFs, tutors, and numerous other mental health resources, it is difficult to argue that Harvard has not made efforts to support its students. However, Harvard can continue to improve.
There are important fixes that can be made to Harvard’s mental health system to facilitate the recovery of struggling students. Harvard should improve the continuity of care for students after they have been seen for mental health emergencies and increase the dialogue with students taking mental health-related leaves of absence. Additionally, it is imperative to acknowledge that students’ sophomore, junior, and senior years can be just as challenging as freshman year. Systemic changes can then be made to provide upperclassmen with resources similar to the Freshman Dean’s Office, proctors, and PAF system.
In a college environment where the student body experiences a complete turnover every four years, it is easy to believe that institutional reforms are the only changes necessary. Nevertheless, in order to improve mental health at Harvard, institutional changes are not the only avenue we must pursue.
Reshaping the way that Harvard students talk (or rather, do not talk) about mental health is a task that is too often overlooked. Admitting that one is not fine and is struggling goes against everything that has been engrained in the Harvard student. While cultural changes take time and are not as readily implemented as institutional initiatives, they are just as important.
Throughout the semester, in The Crimson and on HarvardSpeaksUp.com, we have seen powerful stories of individuals who have struggled with mental health obstacles. The stories have been published as a movement to create more open conversations and to demonstrate that the Harvard façade of perfection is not a reality. These messages are encouraging signs that openness is possible.
Façades have been constructed and mental health has become a stigmatized topic partly because of an assumption that mental health issues originate when one’s brain—the organ that gives us identity—is permanently malfunctioning. But, by creating a community where students and faculty are willing to say, “I struggled with a mental health concern, but I took steps to work through it, and I’m gradually getting better,” our community begins to break down the aura of permanence and build hope. For some students, recovery is slow and may include relapses. To aid in the process, students may prefer to speak with a mental health counselor rather than a friend, or with a parent rather than a proctor. Regardless of the path, by normalizing mental health concerns and saying that “it does get better,” we build an understanding that individuals throughout our community—from freshmen to tenured professors— struggle.
It is a sobering reality that suicide will always be a part of our society, but this fact should not hinder our efforts to shape a college community that looks to address the root of suicide and other mental health concerns. Conversations between administrators and students during the past year have highlighted the need to foster both an institution that is more attentive to the needs of its students and a student body that encourages an open dialogue about mental health and views struggling as conquerable. By focusing on these two goals, we can continue to build a community that cares for its members as they inevitably encounter mental health challenges during their college experiences.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you ask people what they liked most about Harvard, the answer is always, "The people!" You love the people. They are smart, they are interesting, and they are headed great places.
It's when they get there that's the problem.
Oscar Wilde used to tell his dinner companions a story about two devils who were torturing a holy hermit. They beat him and applied thorns to his tender regions and did all kinds of terrible things, but the holy man persisted in defying them. Then the Devil came along. He leaned close to the hermit's ear and whispered, "Your brother has just been made Bishop of Alexandria." At this point the hermit turned bright red and started to scowl. "That," the Devil said, "is the sort of thing I should recommend."
The further you get out of college, the more of a resemblance your life bears to this story.
You are going along, confident and chipper and feeling that, if your life is not exactly perfect, you are headed in the right direction. You have had a healthy breakfast, and this is going to be a Tuesday unlike any Tuesday before it.
Then you glance up at the TV and see the horrible news: Your best friend has just sold his start-up for several million dollars.
This isn't actually horrible news, of course. Really horrible news would be if a horse collapsed on top of your best friend and he lost an arm. So why do you get that weird, momentary stab in your gut?
"Every time a friend succeeds," Truman Capote said, "a little something in me dies."
"No," you're saying. "I'm not like that. I am just overflowing with yeasty benevolence toward all and sundry, a phrase that I realize now sounds weird and alarming, but I'm going to go with, because now I'm too deep into the sentence to turn back."
This is the one thing Harvard has neglected to prepare you for.
 
Trust me. I have reached the exact age where I dash up to high schoolers on the street, grip them by the arms and mutter, "It's not too late!  You must listen! Save yourself from the mistakes that I have made." If that's a phase and not just a thing that I am doing.
Look, you can deal with failure. You have read that it is the crucible where character is forged, or something like that. You can handle it, because you believe in yourself. "All right," you say, when the third rejection letter comes in. "Heck yeah! Forging some character right here!"
But how do you deal with success? How do you deal with the worst kind of success: the kind that befalls other people?
Worse yet, it comes in different forms. There are eight Emmies sitting on your shelf, but Dorothy over there has managed to find love. You figured out how to fix throat cancer, but Andy already has a firstborn son. You have a generally perfect life—but it's Here, where everything closes at 11:30 and there is nothing that can be reasonably described as a cappuccino, and everyone else seems to live There, where fun never sleeps and Ryan Gosling routinely darts out to save people from oncoming traffic.
No matter how successful you are, no matter how good you are at what you do, even if a golden path rolls out in front of your feet your whole life, there will come one particularly bleak Tuesday when you glance over at Facebook and notice that Jen From Down The Hall has just won an Oscar. Burt Zinffer, whom you once rejected at a party because he reminded you of a vole with a poor conception of personal space, has just married a freakishly attractive human and become the governor of Michigan.
That was the whole point of coming to Harvard: to meet all these interesting great talented people who were going to do great things. But when these Great Things go from theory to practice, it hits you in the vitals. Sure, you like the relevant announcement on Facebook. Then the temptation is to go punch a small hole in the wall and bellow, "WHY GOD WHY," and eat several pounds of brisket while screaming wordlessly. I'm not saying you succumb. You are bigger than that. But still.
It's hard enough to be happy for yourself.
That is why you absolutely have to do the thing you want to do and not what you think you should do or what your parents do or what you feel gives you the highest number of Life Achievement Points. When Jeff from Canaday comes strolling by with his Ryder Cup, if you cannot say, "Well, but today I did something that made me happy," you will rupture something, and it certainly won't occur to you to send Jeff a thoughtful card.
Do you.
 
If you're doing what you do because you love it, you have room to be happy for others. And that's a lot of fun, when you get down to it. Cheering is a great time, and you have an immense team of people to cheer for. When you cheer, people want to be around you. You get to go to the party to celebrate Dave's promotion and meet Warren Buffett, rather than sit at home unnerving your Roomba by scowling at it.
"Anyone can sympathize with the suffering of a friend," Oscar Wilde wrote. "It requires a truly fine nature…to sympathize with a friend's success."
Figure out how to do this, and you have it made.

We statisticians are asked to consult about evidence in every subject. Your graduation today provides evidence to conclude that you have greatly increased your chance for a successful career. When we ask faculty members what are the job opportunities for  majors in their field they always emphasize that the demand is better for better students. A problem of great concern to researchers on education, from kindergarten to college is: What can be done to stimulate students to perform best, and thus increase chances for career success and happiness in life?
Many educational researchers agree that it is not enough to have a high IQ, intelligence quotient, and the high grades that come with it. To be best one needs more: a hook, an  extra quality. We call the hook that distinguishes the best from the rest CQ, character quotient. By CQ we mean the following manifestations of character: Conversation—the quality of rarely being bored; Curiosity, a passion for learning; Commitment—a grit and devotion to completing the job; and Compassion—a concern for others.
The best students need to be able to cope with failures and problems, and improve their luck by trying to make opportunities (i.e. good luck) out of problems (ie. bad luck). Progressive Insurance started on its road to success because its founders, Joseph Lewis and Jack Green, achieved the insight that when your customers are unhappy you thank them for letting you know so that you can improve your service. In the same sense, when you get a low grade on a midterm exam, your insight should be to regard it as both bad news and good news: It teaches you what you don’t know so that you can learn it for the final exam.
To be the best you can be, it helps to also practice the statistical “law of np.” Your average number of successes is the product of n (the number of attempts you make to succeed) and p (the probability of success on each attempt).  The value of p may be very small and beyond your control. But the value of n is under your control, and you should make it as large as possible. A quick way to summarize this advice is “If at first you don’t succeed, try again!”
Another quotation to keep in mind as one seeks to perform best is from the Jewish sage Hillel the Elder: “If I am not for myself who will be? If I am for myself alone, what am I?” We believe that indispensable to happiness is an attitude of gratitude. Studies prove that when you express gratitude you increase your own happiness, as well as the happiness of those to whom you express gratitude. It is for good reason that parents often try to instill in their children an attitude of gratitude.
Statistical thinking helps one’s success in life and career by quantifying uncertainty using probability. It is important to distinguish between outcomes that are conceivable (i.e. zero probability), possible (i.e. positive probability for an interval of similar outcomes), and probable (i.e. positive probability). Statistical thinking is used to answer questions about what one knows and how one knows it, based on analysis of data more than expert opinions.
The final advice we have: Prepare for change! Previous generations expected to have the same employer for a lifetime. You may have to reinvent yourself and change careers as often as every 5 years. Never stop learning, and try to be aware of trends. Avoid unnecessary worry about your future while preparing for it and enjoying the present. Especially enjoy this day of Commencement.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dear Seniors:
This is a time of celebration for all of you but also a time of reflection, ambivalence, and even anxiety. I know that some of you are sad to leave Harvard; others can’t get out the door fast enough. I know, too, that you have all had very different hopes and dreams, and very different college experiences, so it’s hard to find something meaningful to say to such a diverse and wise group of people.
When I graduated from Harvard College 27 years ago, I was filled with trepidation and sadness, not joy. I remember sitting in a packed Memorial Church on graduation morning, as some of you may be doing now, with a feeling that I had squandered the supposedly best years of my life. I felt I had made a mess of some fairly big things: a thesis, boyfriend, and job plan, among them. I wished that I could have a do-over of college, even though the prospect of staying on even another day beyond graduation was distasteful to me. I’m sharing this because I am well aware that while some of you have had great triumphs over the last four years, quite a few of you have struggled, too. Some of you have faced illness or academic difficulties or heartbreak. Some of you have been disappointed, in yourselves or in others. Some of you have felt that you didn’t deserve to be here or that you never really fit in.
But what I want to tell you is this – and it has special meaning for me as I prepare to leave Harvard myself this summer: no matter how you feel about Harvard College, you are all united in the amazing fact that you made it through this extraordinary, sometimes maddening, life-changing institution. And whether you found the journey a stroll in the park or a slog through a parched desert, or a little of both, the fact that you made it through is what matters.
When you look back in a decade or two, you may be surprised to find that your memories have begun to blur and change. Those of you who loved Harvard may see more of its chinks and cracks. Those of you who hated it may begin to feel a bit more generous.  But however you narrate this episode of your life, the main thing that matters is that you made it through.
You may think your relationship with Harvard is over now but, really, it’s just beginning – and not only because the Alumni Association can always find you. Harvard will follow you for the rest of your life and, if you are smart about it, you’ll let Harvard tag along next to you and you won’t worry too much about what it means or what people think of it.
Don’t make too much of a fuss about Harvard College one way or another and you may find that it treats you pretty well over a lifetime. It’s the gift that keeps on giving. You may find, as I did, that the word “Harvard” can make your CV miraculously levitate to the top of the pile at a job interview for which you are totally unqualified. You may find, as I did many years ago while working in a village in rural Bangladesh, that the word, “Harvard” can literally save your life when you are near death. Or you may find, as I did, that the man of your dreams secretly always wanted to marry a Radcliffe girl. And most important of all, you may find, as I have found again and again, that the magic word, “Harvard” gives you the confidence and resources to reach out and lift someone up who really needs lifting.
Bravo for getting through. Well done. Enjoy that word, “Harvard” that is now forever connected to your name. Don’t take it too seriously. But do take it a little seriously. You’ve earned it. Congratulations and very best wishes to all of you.

Among the most disheartening expressions in the work world is “Thank God it’s Friday.”  Implicit in that “prayer” is disdain for Monday and the rest of the workweek.  Unfortunately in the current job market, that is too often a reality.  Today’s graduates are entering an economy that is growing sluggishly. Great jobs are few and far between.  Today’s university graduates feel lucky when they get even boring jobs.  Too many quickly settle for a workweek that sustains itself on looking forward to Friday and the work-free weekend.
You’re all too good for that.  And not because you’re graduating from a great university, but because every human being should aspire to a job—a career—that has them saying “thank God it’s Monday.”   Don’t take a job unless it is fulfilling.  It is better to struggle economically than to settle into a career that gives you little or no gratification.
Not everybody can create a startup.  Not even every Harvard graduate will become Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg.  But many of you can start new enterprises, can find gaps that need filling in or apps that need inventing.  Set your sights high.
My generation graduated into an expanding economy.  We all knew that we would be better off economically than our parents, who came of age during the Great Depression.  We had it easy.  You don’t.  Adversity requires creativity, determination and innovation.  What has been called “The Greatest Generation” followed almost immediately upon the Great Depression and came of age during a terrible war.  Adversity creates opportunity.  I am not suggesting here that survival of the fittest is a morally sound approach to life. What I am suggesting is that difficult economic times require young adults to create their own futures rather than to fit into the pigeonholes of a thriving economy.
When I was growing up, my mother always told me “Don’t start up.”  (She meant don’t start fights or talk back!)  Now every mother and father should be telling their children “Start up!”  You can become the start up generation.
Israel has been called the Start Up Nation—it has more start ups, more patents, more NASDAQ listings, more high tech innovations than any country of comparable size and nearly any country regardless of size.  Why Israel?  Because of adversity.  When Moses took his trek out of Egypt, he turned north instead of south.  Had he turned south, he would have put the Israelite people atop oil fields.  By turning north, he gave them nothing but barren deserts.  Those countries with the oil fields, such as Saudi Arabia, and the Emirates, have never needed to innovate. All they need to do is drill baby drill.  It is countries without natural resources that need start ups, that require the use of human capital. In the world in which we live, human capital—you—are the key to success.
A smart person once observed that adversity causes some to break, and others to break records.  Shakespeare talked about embracing adversity and making sweet use of it.  So you are blessed with adversity.  Take advantage of it.  Innovate.  Start up.  Create.
Don’t settle for humdrum work lives.  Don’t live for the weekend.  Seek interesting work.  Make your work fascinating.  Live the passion of your times.  As another wise man put it:  “You live only once.”  You can become the greatest generation, hopefully during peacetime.  You can help turn around the economy.  You can help preserve the environment.  You can pursue justice.  You can and will make a difference.
We’ve all heard the cliché that “nobody on their death bed ever regretted not having spent more time at the office.”  Sure! That is, if you achieved a high degree of professional and financial success during your lifetime.  But the reality is that there are many people who should regret not having spent more time at work.  These are the people who failed to achieve their potential because of laziness or misplaced priorities.  We rarely hear their deathbed regrets:  “Damn, I should have spent less time working and more time with my ungrateful kids and the wife who left me for a more successful guy.”
Strike a balance between work and play, career and family, doing good and doing well.  That balance should include looking forward both to Monday and Friday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is 2038. The Harvard College Class of 2013 is about to reconvene for its 25th alumni reunion. What will its members find?
It is 2013. The answer to that question is unknowable, but one hint is to consider what the members Class of 1988, the current 25th reunion class, observe as they reminisce. When its members were College Seniors, Japan was Number One. Its economy, its manufacturing processes, its consensus approach to decision making, and its technological versatility had dazzled the world in preceding decades. Three years before Commencement, in 1985, the countries we now know as the members of the European Union had signed the Schengen Agreement to open their borders to each other to permit the passport-free movement of the citizens of member countries. In 1986, the Single European Act dramatically changed the rules for economic transactions between member countries, unleashing the promise of European prosperity in years to come. Also in 1986, Spain and Portugal joined as full member countries, in recognition of their successful transition from dictatorship to democracy, and deployed policies to nurture impressive economic growth. On Commencement 1988, the Soviet Union’s leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, appreciably younger than the president of the United States, embodied the prospects for economic reform and a more general openness that augured well for the superpower’s future and for change also in Communist-rule Eastern Europe. Much good had happened, but no simple straight-line projection would have served as a reliable forecast for the quarter century yet to follow.
The Harvard College of the Class of 1988 had many fewer students who held passports from countries other than the United States. Approximately one out of five graduating Seniors of the Class of 2013 hold such passports. In 1988, the Harvard Summer School had not yet invented its impressive array of courses and programs abroad, which would be available to the Class of 2013. In 1988, Harvard College’s rules discouraged study abroad. In 1988, Paul and Harriet Weissman had not yet established their programs for internships the world over, nor had David Rockefeller’s magnificent gift to encourage and facilitate all kinds of undergraduate international experiences yet been made. The Class of 2013, therefore, found a Harvard College more open to, and readier to equip you for, the world as it has been changing. On Commencement Day, a significant majority of the Class of 2013 has had a significant international experience during their years at Harvard.
Yet, the connections between the world and the College are often still elusive. Do members of the Class of 2013 think much about the fact that the United States has been at war uninterruptedly, each and every year, for most of their lifetimes? Have they cheered that, within the past two decades, hundreds of millions of formerly poor people have stopped living in utter misery, mainly in China, but also in India, Brazil, Mexico, and other countries? Yet, have they also noticed that the poor still people much of the world, and that, for many years, the promise of prosperity for the median citizen in the United States, Europe, and Japan has seemed remote at best?
One of the older formulations about the meaning of a liberal arts education is a residual, that is, whatever may remain after you have forgotten all the facts. With the facts about to be forgotten, then, your parents, your teachers, all who care for you, and you above all, hope that you have learned to think, analyze, interpret, perceive, ascertain, imagine, emote, research, compute, test and otherwise embody other active verbs that have earned you the greetings of the President on Commencement morning, as she welcomes you to the fellowship of educated men and women.
Today, even more than a quarter century ago, we also expect you to be alert to the world all over the world, understand that the global begins at home wherever home may be, and that globality is not an invention of the present but part of a legacy of sensibilities and understandings on which the present builds and connects to the distant past. In a world still torn by war, you must focus honorably, albeit critically, on why and how others may disagree with you, and must consider respectfully aesthetics, systems of belief, and approaches to life that may be quite at odds from yours. Affirm your values, deploy your competence, but always in the certainty that veritas requires ongoing struggle in its search, sustained uncertainty en route, and the pleasures of its encounter some time, somewhere—but never before your 25th reunion—for a life of learning, accomplishment, and contribution to the world.

The Harvard College graduate of 2013 has experienced an epoch of social media revolution. Since 2004, a wave of interaction applications—Facebook, Gmail, Twitter, and others far too hip for me—have come to play a dramatic role in human interactions. But despite the rise of e-acquaintanceship, face-to-face contact remains the best tool for communicating the most complex ideas or the most sensitive thoughts, and that is why universities like Harvard and cities like Boston will continue to thrive.
When I came to Harvard 21 years ago, I was foolish enough to think that lecturing required two things: knowing your subject and being somewhat more entertaining than the usual college professor.  Twenty-one years later, I’ve come to realize how difficult it is to teach a complicated idea by talking or scribbling in chalk on the board. The riff on general equilibrium that I was sure would make everything clear to everyone actually didn’t work for anyone but me. I’ve learned hard concepts need to be presented repeatedly from different angles, even for the most brilliant students.
Indeed, it may be that the greatest talent that a teacher can have is the ability to hear through their students’ ears, to understand what they understand. Some of my colleagues seem born with this gift. I was not.
So I struggle, year after year, trying to figure out what aspects of my lectures are easily grasped and what parts are merely mind-numbing.  Talking to a hundred different students simultaneously is particularly challenging, because each student comprehends in a slightly different way.
But face-to-face teaching has one great advantage: Teachers get real-time feedback on how students are responding to our words. Humans have evolved over millions of years to have marvelous cues for communicating comprehension or confusion. Those cues are obvious when we’re in the same room, but not when lecturing via YouTube or by satellite. Most smart teenagers have spent years learning how to mask their rare moments of ignorance, but in lectures, the mask occasionally slips, which is lucky because teaching is much easier when students display what they aren’t understanding.
The face-to-face advantage in study groups, seminars and advising is also enormous.  A good seminar is an unpredictable, unfolding process that draws in the entire group.  I’ve never experienced the same energy or intellectual interaction in any electronic exchange.
Advising is delicate, because potentially painful criticism must be carefully modulated towards the individual student. Be too soft and the student misses the point. Be too hard and you make the student furious and resentful. Being in the same room allows better calibration. I haven’t always gotten advising right, but I would have been a far worse advisor if I only advised electronically.
The advantages of face-to-face teaching are mirrored in many other parts of life. If you need to criticize a colleague, do it in person. Praise is more valued when received face-to face. If you have a complicated idea to share with a partner, share it in the same room.  And don’t put anything in an email that you don’t want to see publicly pilloried in the blogosphere.
I’m not a Luddite. I strongly support edX. Technology has much to offer almost every course at Harvard, and long-distance learning has the potential to provide slightly lower quality education at a vastly lower cost. But I’m equally sure that the live, in-person, learning process isn’t going away. It will simply co-evolve with other means of communication, just as cities are also co-evolving with the internet.
Twenty-five years ago, cyber-seers and techno-prophets predicted that electronic interactions would make face-to-face contact and the cities that enable that contact obsolete. Why put up with the bother of working in New York, if you can just link in without wires?
But the past two decades have been good to cities, and good to America’s strongest universities. Universities and cities have much in common. They both connect humans and enable them to work together and learn from one another.
Our globalized, technological world has placed an ever higher premium on knowledge and innovation.   Human beings become smart by being around smart people. Every new idea is cobbled together from the thoughts that surround us. The best innovators are really superb at seeing what ideas are best to borrow from others.  We do learn in cyberspace, but we learn even more in person.  In a more complicated world, ideas are easier to lose in translation, which makes face-to-face contact even more valuable.
I don’t know what exactly a Harvard education will look like in 20 years, but I’m pretty sure of two things. New technologies will be even more important, but face-to-face learning will still be at the heart of the Harvard experience.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To the 2013 Graduating Class of Harvard University,
I congratulate you today on receiving one of the most hard-earned and prestigious degrees in our American higher education system. This is quite an exceptional achievement!
My parents are immigrants from Colombia who spoke no English; nor did I, until I started going to school. My parents taught me that America was the land where anything was possible if you work hard enough, and, like many of you, I was one of the first in my family to go to college—the United States Naval Academy. I felt I had an obligation to give back to the country that had given me and my family so much.
Following my graduation from the Naval Academy, I earned my wings in flight school. I loved being a pilot, but a deeper sense of obligation and duty let me to transfer to the Navy SEALS. I succeeded with training and became a platoon commander after completion of my training.
I left the Navy in 1996 and went back to school to further my education. In the same spirit as many of you, I earned my MBA from Harvard Business School and began working in the private sector right here in Boston.
We’re very lucky, not just to have a degree from this prestigious institution, but also to have the abilities to further our success right here at our fingertips. Boston is the most remarkable city in the most remarkable state in the most remarkable country on earth. Right here we have not only some of the country's best schools, but also best hospitals, biggest companies, and opportunities in nearly every field you can imagine.
I want to tell you, too, that with great opportunities comes great responsibility. I urge you to bear that in mind, as you go off into the world. Our responsibility to ourselves and to our communities is to make sure the American dream is still achievable for the generations that will come after us. As the son of Colombian immigrants who is now the nominee for U.S. Senate, I can tell you that the American dream was achievable for me, and my duty as a father, as a husband, as a community leader is to make sure it is achievable for my children.
Again, congratulations and godspeed on your journey.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the AMC Loews shuttered its doors in July 2012, Harvard Square lost one of its prominent late night attractions. The absence of the theater not only left a void in the Square’s nighttime entertainment offerings but also curbed the number of people on the streets after dark.
Nevertheless, more restaurants serving food past midnight have recently cropped up in the Square.
In the past year, Tasty Burger opened its doors, Insomnia Cookies brought fresh-baked desserts into the Square, and The Sinclair created not only a late-night restaurant but also a concert venue. Yogurtland is slated to arrive soon and serve up forzen yogurt until midnight.
The surge of late-night options has catered to the desire for a more robust nighttime culture and satiated the stomachs of students and residents, but it has also increased competition for existing businesses that have long been open after midnight.
As new late-night eateries continue to emerge, Harvard Square is poised to play host to an even more vibrant nightlife.
ZERO HOUR SNACKING
While Harvard Square staples like IHOP, Market in the Square, Falafel Corner, and Hong Kong Restaurant emerged during the earlier years of the late-night trend, this past year saw a spike in the number of eateries open into early morning hours.
“Late-night in Harvard Square is something that we have been working on for several years,” said Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association.
According to Jillson, the improvements in the late-night offerings stem from the Healthy Harvard Square Initiative—a series of meetings held by the Economic Development Division of Cambridge from 2005 to 2006 to find out what students, property owners, business owners, and residents hoped to see in the Square. The most popular request was for more late-night dining and entertainment options.
Seven years after these meetings, Christopher A. Miao ’16 said he found it “surprising” that Harvard had so many late-night options. For him, Tasty Burger seemed to be the “game-changer,” as it stays open until 4 a.m.
“It used to be just a pizza and a burrito, but if you throw in a burger, that just changes everything,” Miao said.
Renee Sarnecky, marketing manager of Serve U Brands, the parent company of Insomnia Cookies, noted that these late-night hours can improve business. For Insomnia Cookies, that time is central to when the company makes a profit.
“I think it’s where we find the most excitement and where we see the biggest spike in the business,” she said.
Both Felipe’s Tacqueria co-owner Thomas J. Brush and Pinocchio’s co-owner Adam DiCenso noted that most revenue made by their restaurants comes from the lunch and dinner rush, but business begins to pick up again after midnight.
HUNGRY AFTER MIDNIGHT
While the bar scene in the Square is largely limited to those over the age of 21, the recent trend towards late-night hours provides food for anyone wanting a bite after midnight.
DiCenso attributed the post-midnight sales rush to what he called the “partying crowd,” which he said consists of both Harvard students and local residents.
“A lot more bars are open until 1 or 2 a.m. and when people have a few drinks at night, they feel like eating,” DiCenso said. “When bars close, they stumble around the Square looking for somewhere to eat.”
Whan Lee ’15, a Crimson editorial editor, who considers himself part of this crowd, said that the accessibility of these restaurants is key.
“After a late night of having fun, you don’t want to walk very far. The convenience factor is an important one,” he said.
Students listed Pinocchio’s, Tasty Burger, and Felipe’s among their favorite late-night joints. Lee said that these places not only have delicious food but also offer a “chatty and social” atmosphere that undergraduates enjoy.
“The Kong is usually the best for atmosphere. It’s a sit-down place, and it’s good for talking with other people,” Lee said.
Though their choices might be limited for now, students said they are generally satisfied with the available eateries in Harvard Square past midnight. They named Starbucks and Au Bon Pain as places to grab a quick evening bite and the 24-hour Market In the Square as a convenient place to pick up a sandwich or wrap at any hour of the night.
“I’d definitely love more options, but these current options have been treating me well,” Whitney S. Anderson ’16 said.
PUMPING UP THE NIGHT SCENE
Established late-night businesses have felt the impact of the past year’s increased presence of late-night options.
Brush said that when Felipe’s opened nine years ago as a late-night venue, “it was a mob scene in Felipe’s at two o’clock in the morning on Friday or Saturday nights.” Nowadays, he said, “it still gets very full, but it doesn’t get quite as crazy.”
Brush added that operating at odd times is not without its challenges, since unlike standard lunch or dinner hours, late-night business is influenced by multiple variables including weather and the day of the week. Staffing can also be difficult with public transportation shutting down around 12:30 a.m.
Yet despite these challenges and the pressures of increased competition for existing late-night businesses, Harvard Square continues to add new options.
Josh Bhatti, head of The Bowery Presents: Boston, cited this nighttime energy as one of the reasons why his company chose the Square as the setting to open dining and concert venue The Sinclair.
“We knew we wanted to be in a neighborhood,” he said, rather than a purely business district that effectively “shuts down after hours.”
“I’ve definitely seen more of a pick-up in the late night scene in Harvard Square in a good way,” Bhatti added.
The Square holds potential for even greater late-night activity, according to Jillson, and the HSBA is hopeful that new additions will provide both food and entertainment.
“There are more options than we had in the past,” she said. “And we’re looking forward to a few more.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dear member of the Class of 2013,
Congratulations! You now know what it feels like to stand at the end of an era. For four years, you’ve lived, studied, partied, dined, toiled, laughed, argued, rehearsed, trained—and lots more I won’t venture to list—with hundreds of smart, dynamic peers, in a setting dedicated to helping you thrive. Remember that incessant question of freshman week, “Where are you from?” Now all anybody wants to know is “What are your plans for next year?” Everything is going to change.
It’s a cliché that the only thing constant in life is change. That’s what makes it a compelling election slogan: You can’t beat change when you’ve automatically joined it, just by being alive. But “change” is not a value any more than breathing is a value. Change is a force, and it’s going to push you, inspire you, frustrate you, and strengthen you for the rest of your life. So how will you deal with it?
As a historian, I think a lot about change. I think about how different your experience at Harvard has been from mine. My generation, Generation X, pored over the hardcover Facebook in our dorm rooms. We made plans by calling up our friends on phones plugged into the wall. There were no iPhones, iPads, iPods; no Google, no YouTube, no Wikipedia, no Skype, no Twitter, no blogs. No Annenberg, no Gen Ed, no Wintersession, no Housing Day; and what you call “gems,” we called “guts.” That was Harvard in the last millennium.
You’re part of Generation I. You’re wired—that is, wireless—you post, text, IM, you have the world at your touchscreen, you experience it in gigabytes and nanoseconds. You share more, more often, with more people, than any generation before. The world’s gone digital, and Harvard has primed you to lead it: to innovate, create, develop, and do it fast, lest somebody in China get there first.
It’s tempting to see change as innovation versus tradition, evolution versus extinction, progress versus stagnation, or future versus past. But as a historian I also think a lot about continuity. The fact is, we’ve been here before. Every generation sees itself at the vanguard, ready to innovate and reshape the world. Yesterday’s future is tomorrow’s past. When the only thing constant is change, it’s everything else—innovation, evolution, progress—that becomes relative.
Throughout history, people have tried to change the world without knowing what will come next. When American patriots fired shots at the British redcoats on Lexington Green on April 19, 1775, they started the American Revolution. They didn’t know that the Thirteen Colonies would declare independence in 1776; still less that they would achieve it. On April 19, 1861, a Massachusetts man became the first fatality of the Civil War, in what some dubbed “the Lexington of 1861.” On April 19, 1995, anti-government militia sympathizer Timothy McVeigh blew up the U.S. Federal Building in Oklahoma City. Every year, Massachusetts marks the closest Monday to April 19 as Patriots’ Day, the date of the Boston Marathon. You, above all, will not easily forget what happened on April 15 and 19, 2013.
Some of these are coincidences, some of them deliberate consequences. The point is that none of them was on the minds of the minutemen of 1775: Their cause had a wide range of effects. What goes for history also goes for you. When you leave Harvard you’ll have to find new friends, jobs, places to live and eat and exercise and get your hair cut—and you have no idea who those people will be, where you’ll end up, whether you’ll succeed, whether you’ll be happy, or whether what you want today is what you’ll want tomorrow.
Fortunately, history gives us some tools to work with change. First, it breaks down change into manageable chunks: the units of cause and effect. When it comes to your own life, this means you can make short-term decisions in pursuit of long-term goals. You can build on what you’ve achieved, acquire skills, learn lessons from your mistakes. You can endure pain for gain. Remember that every moment is full of potential, even if you don’t yet know for what.
Second, history opens our eyes to the unexpected and the unintended. Things will happen that you cannot even conceive of—wonderful things and terrible things, scary, ambiguous, disappointing, rewarding things. Let contingency be your friend. Accepting this will free you from feeling frustrated when change doesn’t deliver a predictable outcome, when the steps you take forward somehow end up setting you back. It can help you accept things that happen for seemingly no cause—loss, sickness, death—and focus instead on processing the effects, to seek the good in the achingly bad.
This week you mark the end of an era—for you. College is probably the last time in your life that your experience will be so clearly bookended, from the outset, with established beginnings and ends. From now on, you get to define your own epochs. That’s why graduation is called Commencement, because this ending is also a beginning. So by all means, go out there and make change. Even better, remember that change is what you make of it.

One of the first things about which we learn in our earliest days at Harvard is a concept called “Harvard Time.”  Some of us learned about Harvard Time when we attended our first class and found ourselves unable to comprehend why our distinguished professor displayed no irritation when students casually strolled in to class five, six and seven minutes late.
We quickly learned that “Harvard Time” is the idea that classes begin seven minutes later than specified to allow for transit between classes that meet back-to-back.  Somehow, Harvard Time has come to apply to all student activities, from a cappella concerts to intramural soccer.  This fixture of student life unconsciously becomes ingrained in our daily routine.  However, in my four years at Harvard, I have considered other understandings of Harvard Time, beyond the being-seven-minutes-late-to-everything variety.
As a History concentrator, time is something I routinely ponder.  Historical study examines changes over time and the effect of time on memory.  In my sophomore year, I took a course called “The History of Harvard.”  While I expected it to be full of Harvard trivia, this course profoundly challenged me to reevaluate what I thought I knew about Harvard.  I began to consider Harvard, not in a vacuum filled with historical fast facts about Founding Fathers and football but, rather, in a way that bridges its founding origins as a school that enlightened students through humility and faith to its modern image as the standard for extraordinary achievement.
Harvard Time has come to mean much more to me than its colloquial definition.  Sometimes I think of Harvard Time as Harvard’s 376-year lifetime, over which our university has witnessed remarkable paradigm shifts.  For example, Harvard is older than both modern Russia as reformed by Peter the Great and the fall of the Holy Roman Empire.  Harvard Time also extends further back in history than Newton’s Laws of Motion.  Of course, this is not to say that the date of Harvard’s founding should be marked in history like the shift from “Before Christ” to “Anno Domini,” but it is fascinating to think that Harvard graduates, not entirely unlike ourselves, once left Harvard Yard to perform their lives’ work in a world that had not yet accepted heliocentricity.
We can also understand Harvard Time as a special period of four years in the timeline of our own lives, which we spend within this place of seeming enchantment.  Time simultaneously slows down and accelerates.  We lament that four years flew right by, but when we realize how much we have grown, it is almost inconceivable that so many wonderful things could have happened in just four years.  In our own personal Harvard Time, we crossed paths with our heroes.  In conversations with friends, we began to develop into our future selves.  For this phase of life called Harvard Time, the world is open to those brave enough to seek inspiration and opportunity.
What is special about attending Harvard in our own time and graduating in 2013?  In our own Harvard Time, we enjoyed the rare event of a snow day.  We celebrated 375 years of Harvard Time with fanfare.  During our time here, Harvard has promoted future entrepreneurship and education with the iLab and EdX.  Global events occurring beyond Harvard have greatly influenced discourse and activity on campus. In our Harvard Time, Apple invented the first iPad.  SEAL Team Six killed Osama bin Laden.  The Arab Spring left the Middle East in upheaval.  Harvard was occupied.  The Boston community came together in the aftermath of the tragic Marathon bombing.  In every age, we face challenges—wars, economic disasters, epidemics, revolutions—and at the end of their own Harvard Time, past graduates we admire went forth to better themselves and the world.  For Harvard students graduating in the present, this responsibility remains very much the same.
Over the course of Harvard Time, our university, once a humble outpost of enlightenment, has become the universal symbol of success and achievement.  But what makes this moment in Harvard Time different from past eras is that the moral value of aspiration and achievement is being questioned.  It is no secret that Harvard students are driven by the prospect of achievement, but what we in the class of 2013 face as perhaps our greatest challenge is demonstrating that the desire to succeed is not something for which we should apologize.  Rather, the message we must share with those around us is that the value of aspiration is inherently positive, while, at the same time, proving that our desire for excellence is not simply the manifestation of raw hubris.  Harvard students must show the rest of the world that achievement is a force for good, as long as we seek achievement within the doctrine of humility.  While looking to the future, we must learn from Harvard Time of the past and remember that humility was a tenant upon which Harvard was founded so many years ago.  The desire to succeed must always be rooted in humility, and that is what I have come to understand at this moment in Harvard Time.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A total of 1,651 Harvard College seniors became graduates Thursday morning as University President Drew G. Faust conferred degrees on the Class of 2013 at the University’s 362nd Commencement exercises in Tercentenary Theatre.
“By virtue of authority delegated to me, I confer on you the first degree in arts or in science, and I admit you to the fellowship of educated women and men,” Faust said to a chorus of cheers from the new graduates and their supporters. “Congratulations.”
Faust conferred the College degrees shortly before 11 a.m. after a long and hot morning of festivities in the Theatre. She also recognized students from Harvard’s 11 other degree-conferring schools, as well as the University Extension School; all told, Faust conferred 7,321 degrees.
The morning began with a long procession through Harvard Yard and into the Theatre, during which degree candidates from across the University sought to add even more spirit to the occasion. Candidates from the Harvard Kennedy School processed with a small, inflatable blue globe in hand, while Divinity School students carried paper fans emblazoned with their school’s logo. Harvard Medical School students waved stethoscopes over their heads and cheered when their degrees were conferred. One graduating student from the Extension School sported a decorative elephant on the top of his cap.
The morning was punctuated by orations delivered by soon-to-be graduates and ended with the awarding of several honorary degrees by Faust. Recipients included Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino, who grew visibly emotional as his honorary Doctor of Laws degree was conferred, and Oprah Winfrey, the television personality and renowned philanthropist who will address graduates and their supporters at exercises beginning at 2:15 p.m.
