After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As far as much of Generation Y is concerned, only old cranks complain about the rise of online communications and media. Sure, a Facebook message isn’t as personal as a telephone call, nor is Wikipedia as reliable as Britannica. But what took two hours in 1980 often takes only two minutes today. We are infinitely more efficient at many things, and when one looks at the upsides of the computer age, the argument goes, the downsides are trivial. Of course, this theory has its share of dissidents. Among them is author James Ladsun, who writes about his suffering at the hands of an online stalker—a self-styled “verbal terrorist” on whom he bestows the pseudonym “Nasreen”—who wants nothing more than to “ruin him.” Whereas the Internet has become a source of unprecedented convenience for many, for Ladsun it has become a source of infinite torment.
In his memoir “Give Me Everything You Have,” Ladsun cleverly catalogs his tormentor’s diabolical methods: her tweaks of his Wikipedia entry, her malicious reviews of his works on Amazon, and her tech-savvy scheme of forwarding inappropriate articles from his email address to academic colleagues, just to name a few. Ladsun also goes on a psychological journey, trying to make sense of his predicament while dissecting Nasreen’s potential motives. The contrast he creates between a victim who wants nothing more than to be left alone and the rage of an imbalanced anti-heroine is compelling; its inherent salaciousness makes Ladsun’s fate salient and effectively warns of the Internet’s dark possibilities. But while the author earns our sympathy through his well-described tribulations, he also abuses it through endless asides, obscure literary allusions, and garish prose that undermine his directive.
Ladsun’s tale, to summarize, begins in 2003 when Nasreen enrolled in a college-level creative writing course that he was teaching in New York City. A shy, introverted Iranian-American woman, Nasreen had begun to write a novel following the exploits of an upper-crust family in Tehran in the ’70’s. Her classmates were mildly impressed by the tale, but Ladsun was downright stirred. “Her language was clear and vigorous,” Ladsun writes, and he describes her prose as possessing a “distinct fiery expressiveness…that made it a pure pleasure to read.”
After the semester ended, Ladsun and Nasreen became enmeshed in their own writing projects and fell out of contact. Then, in 2005, Nasreen emailed Ladsun with a draft of her novel, hoping to receive some advice on the publishing process. This correspondence quickly transformed into a flurry of online chats, and Ladsun is forthcoming about how he enjoyed the exoticism, the “novelty” of his young, Persian amie de plume. Soon, however, Nasreen’s emails became too explicit and too indicative of psychological imbalance for Ladsun to ignore. She ranted about her colleagues with inappropriate vigor, offered to model her body for Ladsun’s enjoyment, and began sending him flirtatious pictures of herself.
He rebuffed her, left her emails unanswered for weeks at a time, and suggested that she seek counseling. Nasreen, in response, grew hostile. At first, she would only prod Ladsun—suggest he’d had affairs with past students or accuse him of disinterest in her literary pursuits. But her hatred of the man soon mushroomed, as did the absurdity of her claims. She came to imply that he drugged and raped her, and she accused him of founding a Jewish literary “cartel.” Soon, she had completed her transformation from a promising young wordsmith into a monomaniacal stalker.
Ladsun could have used this experience to reflect upon the technological conditions that make Nasreen’s “verbal terrorism” possible, and occasionally, he does. But the problem with these reflections is that they often segue into a series of unrelated side-tales that connect only peripherally to the topic at hand. In one of his more lengthy asides, Ladsun details a journey across America by train. He reflects extensively upon the strip sprawl of Chicagoland; he indulges in a long conversation with an innocent Boy Scout who has never left Kansas; he describes his travels in New Mexico as a literary tourist. Later in the novel, he explores Jerusalem on a journalistic assignment, discusses the Six-Day War, and investigates the history of the twice-destroyed Hurva temple. At some points, he strays so far from the core narrative that it seems he needs reminding that his life is not as interesting to the general public as it is to his stalker.
These lengthy asides often evolve into discussions of literature. “Macbeth,” “Othello,” “Sir Gawain and the Green Knight,” and the works of Lawrence, Coleridge, and Plath come up in the course of his introspections. He quotes many at length—even his own poetry at one point—and he dedicates pages to rehashing plotlines. These glimpses into a literary mind are interesting to an extent, but when Ladsun dusts off a collection of Heidegger’s essays while interpreting Nasreen’s enraged references to Rilke, or quotes “Gawain” in its original Middle English while dissecting Isaac Bashevis Singer’s “The Penitent,” the text comes across as too self-important, which detracts from the naturally compelling story of conflict happening in his day-to-day existence. Ladsun continually refocuses the narrative, but not before surveying an esoteric collection of loosely related fictions.
However, even when Ladsun does directly discuss his nemesis and her manipulation of technology, the pretentious, pseduo-literary framework of the novel lends itself to equally pretentious prose. Ladsun often indulges in cumbersome adverbial phrases such as “sententiously though, in light of the catastrophe that later unfolded, with odd clairvoyance,” and clunkily strings together adjectives as in “one of those avuncular, rather eunuchy types.” Certain passages, such as those of the Western landscape during his trans-Atlantic journey, are succinct and stirring, but these segments are the exception.
“Give Me Everything You Have” is essentially a memoir coated in literary fat. The wearisome prose, the arcane references, and the endless asides too often drown the narrative. The compelling tale of a malevolent, unbalanced antagonist using uniquely modern tools to attack the author is there; uncovering it may be a rewarding experience, but rest assured, it’ll take some digging.

The plot of Jules Massenet’s opera “Cinderella” centers around the same elements as that of the Disney movie everyone grew up with: a girl, a godmother, a glass slipper. What people might not recognize from their childhood version, in the opera however, are iPhone selfies, Juicy Couture tracksuits, and the “bend and snap” from “Legally Blonde.” But that is exactly what you get with Dunster House Opera’s production, which runs through Saturday in Dunster Dining Hall. With incredible wit and fantastic musical performances across the board, the show maintains all the charm of the original story while updating the comical theatrics and costumes.
Director Katherine E. Moon ’14 gives a modern, playful spin on the classic, providing a tongue-in-cheek parody of modern culture where most viewers are expecting the comfortable familiarity of an age-old fairy tale. The effect is to make the opera more accessible—the two stepsisters (Olivia R. Miller ’16 and Julia I. Biedry ’16), are armed with a brace of Sephora bags and prance about the stage practicing duck faces, while the group of tailors, with their flowing scarves and deep v-necks, recall contemporary hipsters. By playing up these comic elements, Moon has turned a night at the opera, which can seem stodgy and humorless to those less acquainted with the genre, into a light and fun theatrical experience.
Though entirely run by students, the show is marked by the utmost professionalism. All of the elements of the production create a harmonious, balanced whole: nowhere does the orchestra overpower the singers, as so often happens with student productions. Instead, actors and musicians perform in lockstep, working together to convey a dynamic, human side of characters we know so well—after Cinderella flees as the stroke of midnight nears, the prince sings of losing hope that he will ever see his love again, and the cellos echo his despair in their melancholy flourishes.
The central pairing—Cinderella (Amelia H. Ross ’14) and Prince Charming (Allison A. Ray ’14)—provides the opera with a solid emotional core. The fact that the prince is played by a woman may seem like a modern twist, but in fact Massenet originally intended for the part to be played by a soprano. While some productions use a tenor instead, DHO’s decision to have a female prince was the right one. Ray is perfectly suited to the part, with a strikingly beautiful, gentle voice that gives depth to her character. The prince is introduced in a scene where he refuses to get dressed, but the next scene, in which Ray sings affectingly of his loneliness, develops sympathy for her character. And Ross, a talented singer in her own right who so affectingly conveys Cinderella’s anguish in her first scenes, is a perfect match for Ray. The dream scene in which they serenade each other, with the Fairy Godmother’s (Liv A. Redpath ’14) voice floating above their intertwining promises of love, is one of the most magical of the performance.
As the stepmother, Elizabeth K. Leimkuhler ’15 steals the show with her diva-esque take on her role—she chews gum while singing her arias, brandishes a stiletto heel at her harried husband, and even winks creepily at the audience like Lucille Bluth from “Arrested Development.” But Leimkuhler’s theatrics are not designed to compensate for any lackluster singing—she manages to maintain her imperious, sneering air while expertly navigating the difficult notes. At several points during the show, she comically shoves others out of the way so that she can be at the center of attention, but she hardly needs to: her mere presence is enough. If Ray and Ross, with their delicate, heartfelt duets, preserve the essence of Massenet’s original, Leimkuhler’s theatrics give the production a humorous spark and a modern twist.
Redpath, as the Fairy Godmother, gives another exquisite performance. Her voice is sweet and graceful, and she hops with ease from high note to high note. The only hiccup is the floppy, oversized set of wings she wears, which undercut her elegance and distract from her vocal feats. For a production that is otherwise so self-assured in its novel interpretations, this foray into literalism is unnecessary. Costume designer Juliet M. Snyder ’15 dressed all of the other characters in creative modern outfits, so the Fairy Godmother’s garb felt inconsistent with her overall vision.
Still, with the only criticism something as minor as a pair of wings, the overall production is a fantastically successful reinterpretation of a classic fairy tale. With clever elements of satire and a cast that makes Massenet’s arias look easy, DHO’s funny, superbly executed production is more than worth a trudge through the snow.

Let's face it—the Grammys are as much about the performances as they are about the awards. As such, there are the "official" winners, and then there are the real winners—and losers. The Arts blog has highlighted three of each—those whose presence and performance demanded respect, and those who fell flat.
WINNER: Justin Timberlake
JT is back. Donning his "suit and tie shit" and performing via a sepia telecast (because sepia is the classiest color scheme, of course), the former 'N Sync star crushed two new songs from his upcoming album and generally exuded massive swag.
LOSER: Taylor Swift
The anti-swag award goes to T Swift, who was shown awkwardly dancing in her seat for what seemed like every single song. Swift took home one Grammy, but got shut out in all the major categories and essentially lip-synced her way through a bizarre Alice in Wonderland-themed performance of "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together." Ex-boyfriend John Mayer, sitting next to a scantily-clad Katy Perry, probably wasn't too upset over seeing her.
WINNER: Miguel
"Miguel, I don't know who the hell you are, but we need to sing together. I mean, good God. That was the sexiest damn thing I've ever seen," gushed Kelly Clarkson about the R&B singer's performance. Miguel seemed genuinely pumped to be performing his single "Adorn," which took home Best R&B Song honors.
LOSER: Mikky Ekko
If you don't know that name, don't feel bad at all. You'd think that performing with Rihanna would bring out the best in someone, but this singer-songwriter slouched his way through the song "Stay" with the manner and dress of a bored ski lodge attendant.
WINNER: Mumford and Sons
The folk rockers ripped their way through an unsurprisingly raucous version of "I Will Wait" (although the crazy flashing lights seemed over the top for a band that's so consciously acoustic at its core). Later, they got their own tribute performance in the form of The Lumineers' "Ho Hey," and shocked everyone by winning the grand prize of Best Album. Not bad for a band that this publication has likened to "the Old Navy version of last fall's best style."
LOSER: Frank Ocean
It isn't a stretch to say that Frank Ocean won 2012 in music: His debut album, "channel ORANGE," was revered by critics and successfully catapulted him into the mainstream. It was shocking, then, to see him fall to fun., Gotye, and Mumford & Sons in the three major categories of Best New Artist, Best Record, and Best Album respectively. Even more disappointing was his plodding, out-of-tune rendition of "Forrest Gump," during which he looked visibly nervous. Even fellow Odd Future member Earl Sweatshirt looked a bit confused after the performance. For all the pre-Grammys hype surrounding Ocean, this was a huge letdown.

Nearly two decades ago, the Boston Philharmonic Orchestra’s critically acclaimed recording of Mahler’s Symphony No. 6 skyrocketed the orchestra to international fame and even inspired renowned Mahler reviewer Tony Duggan to say that the infamous hammer blows at the end of the piece were the best he had ever heard. Nineteen years later, the symphony will once more be brought to life under the baton of BPO conductor Benjamin Zander, this time at Sanders Theatre on Feb. 21 and Feb. 24.
For its upcoming concerts, the BPO will use a timpani crate and a plumber’s pipe to create the three terrifying hammer blows that occur towards the end of the piece. These blows represent three premonitions or “great blows of fate” that Mahler had, according to legend, foreseen: the loss of his job, the death of his daughter (who passed away at age four), and the discovery of the heart condition that ultimately caused his death. While most conductors, including Mahler himself, would excise the third blow from his performances because they considered playing it to be a bad omen, Zander plans to include it in the BPO’s performance. “Now that [Mahler’s] gone, I don’t have to be concerned about it,” he says. “I’m not afraid.”
The conductor, who considers the dark and dramatic Mahler 6 to be one of the greatest pieces ever composed, looks forward not only to revisiting the piece for himself but also to introducing the symphony to a new generation of listeners. In pursuit of this goal, he will be giving a lecture on the piece before the Sunday performance. “We cannot expect people to be trained in music and understand complicated, long pieces without a little help. I make it my job to explain each piece, since audiences need to be brought into the experience,” Zander says. “The audience has to bring all of their experiences of their own life to the listening…. This could really be a life-changing experience for some.”
Understandably, when the BPO announced that it would again perform the very piece that put it on the map, much of the Boston musical community began to buzz with excitement and curiosity. Despite his experience with the piece, Zander feels the weight of this recognition and of the piece itself. “I’m a little scared of the piece,” Zander says. “I’m scared of the emotional intensity and physical effort. I’m in awe of it.” He estimates that over 2,000 tickets have already been sold for the three performances, but he still hopes that more Harvard students will attend the concert and lecture. “People come to Harvard for extraordinary experiences,” Zander says. “This is one of them.”

Next weekend, the Harvard community will have the chance to hear a diverse array of talented vocalists. Every year during Black History Month, the Kuumba Singers of Harvard College—a choir that celebrates black creativity and spirituality—host the Dr. Walter J. Leonard Black Arts Festival. While the focus of the celebration is Black heritage and art, those who are neither black nor artists need not despair as the weekend-long festival is intended for a diverse audience. “Black history is American history,” says Tsega Tamene ’15, the chair of the Black Arts Festival and a singer in Kuumba. “You don’t have to be black. You don’t have to come from that story or history to acknowledge and celebrate it. The week and festival are for all students.”
This year, the theme of the festival is “Voices,” and Kuumba has taken this to heart in designing their inclusive and celebratory schedule of events. “Black in the Day,” Kuumba’s main concert, will be the centerpiece of the festivities. The performance is a variety show that will feature everything from Kuumba’s signature choral style to hip-hop dances to live jazz tributes. In honor of Black History month, each performer or group will also dedicate their piece to an iconic figure in Black arts. “The goal of the performance is to showcase some of the voices that have existed through history that have made Black art what it is today,” Kuumba President Danitra J. Wansley ’13 says.
“Black in the Day” is just one of the many events scheduled for the Black Arts Festival, which also includes “What is Hip-Hop? Black Voice in Popular Media,” a panel discussion, and “Sing It, Sister!,” a showcase of Black women in the arts. “Sometimes I think Black history is made too serious a thing, and obviously there is a certain tone to a lot of Black history. But a lot of it is just about fun, creativity, and getting down, and that’s what this showcase is about,” Tamene says.

Grammy-winning a cappella group Sweet Honey in the Rock take their name from Psalm 81:16, which reads, “With honey from the rock I would satisfy you.” For over 30 years, the legendary group has been satisfying listeners in its own special way—through soulful, upbeat music with a message of peace. The ensemble visits Harvard this Thursday and Friday for a two-day residency as part of Harvard’s Women’s Choral Festival.
The Festival is organized by the Radcliffe Choral Society every four years and features performances by adult, children’s and collegiate choral ensembles. As the headliners of this wide-ranging event, Sweet Honey in the Rock will be leading a master class in Paine Hall on Thursday and performing in Sanders Theatre Friday night alongside members of the Radcliffe Choral Society and the Kuumba Singers of Harvard College.
Andrew G. Clark, director of choral activities at Harvard and host of Thursday’s event, says that Sweet Honey in the Rock’s unique sound makes them a clear choice to headline. “Their sound is instantly recognizable…. There’s a woman in the group who has a range lower than many of the male basses in the Harvard Glee Club,” he says. Yet the group is notable for more than just technical ability. “They really use their music-making towards a greater end than mere entertainment,” Clark says. “They have a real message when they sing, whether it’s about issues in the African-American community, issues involving women’s rights... the list goes on and on.”
Thursday’s master class, which is free and open to the public, gives lovers of vocal music a rare opportunity to see a legendary group at work in a small-scale setting—and to join in with them as well. “They really do a masterful job of incorporating the audience,” Clark says. “The folks that come will no doubt have a chance to sing along with them…. It’ll be a great chance for [the attendees] to get together and be inspired by these amazing women.”

With its main character considering the endlessness of death, “the realm of wonder and disillusion so sad,” only two pages in, it is immediately clear that Jamaica Kincaid’s latest novel has taken on a promisingly profound set of themes.  Yet for all its sprinkled insights on destiny and the passage of time, “See Now Then” is a case where the sum of the parts performs better than the whole. Kincaid proves able to characterize subtly if unevenly, to make brilliant observations, and to limit her focus to a comparatively small group of recurring leitmotifs. But despite Kincaid’s technical fluidity, the book’s delivery is marred by a miscalculation on Kincaid’s part that casting time as the focal character could eliminate the need for more relatable human ones; ultimately, her attempts to bolster her characters—inserting mythology, gifting them with elevated description—fail as she is unable to control her own superseding, temporal creation.
The ironically named Mr. and Mrs. Sweet, with their son Heracles and their daughter Persephone, have lived undistinguished and unhappy in a rural Vermont house once inhabited by Shirley Jackson—famous for her horror stories that take place in the innocent American suburbs. Mr. Sweet, a white man and sometime aspiring classical musician, has long hated his Caribbean-immigrant wife and desired to kill her, as well as their son, in various gruesome ways: strangling, beheading, blowing their brains out. His charges against her are small in themselves—failing to appreciate his values, laughing too much, giving birth to his children, being uneducated—but over the years have accreted as innocently and irreversibly as a deposit of snow. A kind of Earth-mother Everywoman, Mrs. Sweet struggles in her unappreciated role as a housewife and eases the pain by writing in a journal.
In keeping with Kincaid’s plan to make time “the main character,” as stated in an interview with The New York Times, the novel begins with Mrs. Sweet looking out the window at the rushing waters of a river, reliving old memories of “then” in the moment of “now.” In the end, Mr. Sweet decides to devastate his oblivious wife by more conventional divorce, and Mrs. Sweet is flooded by an internal river of loss, echoing the famous Pythagoras passage in Ovid’s “Metamorphoses”: “Right now will be replaced by another right now: and right now is all there is and all there is over and over again.” Mrs. Sweet’s thought that “my lips that are the shape of chaos before the tyranny of order is imposed on them is where I find myself” suggests Ovid’s cosmogony, where all being is generated from Chaos.
Kincaid has been successful, too successful, in achieving what she wanted with this book: to stylistically subordinate all human identities to the greater presence of time. Kincaid’s style embeds common images from contemporary life (McDonald’s happy meals, Verizon phone bills, Ninja Turtles) in the patterns of ancient history; however,  a third-person narrative voice shifts among the Sweets’ pop-culture-ridden internal monologues with a medieval tone affected through phrases like “benighted” or “in the thrall of.” Enfolded in this bizarre multi-temporal voice,  her characters’ internal monologues become muffled and indistinguishable.  The Sweet family members are too Everywoman-Everyman to be believable as individuals as well, and instead of driving a plot, they passively let the story happen to them. The running gags about Heracles’ Twelve Labors, Persephone’s beauteous beauty, and so on are explicitly and cheesily mythical, and such a mash of past-present is not always effective enough to justify calling it more than cute. Kincaid describes the birth of Persephone:
 “Of course, the beautiful Persephone had opened her lungs by crying upon emerging entirely from Mrs. Sweet’s body (she had been living parasitically off Mrs. Sweet as she lay growing contentedly in that dear woman’s womb) and then she fell deeply asleep and in that sleep she became the beautiful Persephone, again and again and forever.”
The parenthetical aside—comparing the daughter to a parasitic worm—underscores the irony of the parallel between Persephone and her Greek mythological namesake, the daughter of harvest goddess Demeter. But the sharp grossness of the image and the hectic, baby-like, singsong quality of the words “again and again and forever” seem to have been selected mainly for shock value, with the result that the words are distracting and gimmicky. The book’s mythical references are often so crudely ironic that the irony frequently dampens, rather than drawing out, the power of their suggested parallels to classical epic personalities. Overall these moments have an irritating smart and fast feel; Kincaid’s run-on sentences, reflecting the book’s central image of a river, rush at us and flow confusedly away without leaving a lasting impression.
The book’s good moments are always scenes peeking into the mundane, devoid of these tacky modern-myth ironies.  The ending passages are notably powerful, with Mrs. Sweet dissolving into despair: “And now Mrs. Sweet turned not into stone but a mound of mud, and sorrow became her middle name if she possessed one but she did not then and not now.” However, even the vulnerable Mrs. Sweet, the best candidate for credibility among the characters, never entirely possesses her own voice and so does not seem consistently real enough to be called a tragic figure—a phenomenon helped along by Kincaid’s hurried sentences.
Ultimately, Kincaid is at war with her own characters. The characters are losing not only the war against time but also against the whims of their own creator; they can only give in and feel less real. The overly fragmentary nature of the book and flattened characters prevent it from being better than a song or ditty, let alone the symphony it has aspired to be.

Music curator and producer Francis Falceto is best known for having brought late-20th century Ethiopian music to a wider audience. He is the acclaimed producer of the 27-volume “Ethiopiques” CD series that began in 1997, and he is also the author of the 2001 book “Abyssinie Swing: A Pictorial History of Modern Ethiopian Music” and director of the 1996 documentary film “Abyssinie Swing.” Falceto has dedicated his life to sharing and preserving the legacy of Ethiopian music, and he shared his insight on the genre  as the keynote speaker of the “Africa Remix: Producing and Presenting African Musics Abroad” conference at the Mahindra Humanities Center on Friday.
The Harvard Crimson: What drew you to Ethiopian music? And what about it led you to bring it to the world stage?Francis Falceto: I’m a music lover. The day I met this music just by chance was…amazing. I knew quite a lot about various music from Africa, but I had never heard that. And because my sickness is to share what I like, I decided to first go to Ethiopia and then invite [internationally recognized Ethiopian musician] Mahmoud Ahmed—it was then 1985—to perform. You enjoy your music, you understand it is not known—it has not reached our shores, to say—and because you are involved with some friends in promoting music, you decide to make it happen.
THC: How has the landscape of Ethiopian music changed during your time as a producer?FF: From the 20th century until now, the change in Ethiopian music [has been] tremendous. This builds the question: what is tradition? Something static? Is it something dynamic? Does it evolve slowly? Quickly? Through where and why? And how does it come? Now, it’s been about 30 years that I have been very close to Ethiopian music, and I can see on the traditional and modern aspect the evolution is very impressive. In Ethiopia, there are many, many different kinds of music related to different people from different backgrounds. One of the major musics [of Ethiopia] is the music of minstrels. It used to [be] people wandering over the country. After the revolution, they started to open their own cabarets, instead of passing by and getting money. They became settlers in the city. There was transformation in the music, the costumes, and the audience.The [original] big bands were disbanded when the revolution came in, and the electronic keyboard came in massively. Everybody thought the electronic keyboard could replace the band, for economical reasons. But artistically speaking, it has affected terribly the look and the shape of the music. On the other hand, cassette...is cheap and not very fragile and is very democratic in the sense that you don’t need appliances like a turntable or electricity, where you can only listen in the city; with cassettes, just with batteries, you can listen to music in the deep countryside.... Now [Ethiopian music] is trying to rebuild, to become as exciting as it was a half century ago.
THC: Did you expect the acclaim that “Ethiopiques” has received?FF: I had no idea the response would be so nice. For me it is a verification of the first time I listened, that this is great music. And it is one of the last musics of Africa to reach our shores, our ears, [and] our turntables. And I enjoy [seeing] it shared by people of every continent.
THC: Given some of the negative stereotypes that exist about the welfare of Africa, do you feel that your work has changed the perception of Ethiopia?FF: That is true that the image of Ethiopia is terrible from abroad. After 1984, everybody began looking at Ethiopia as a poor country with people lining up as refugees. But it is cliché. Probably on a very modest dimension, “Ethiopiques” may have been able to change this a bit. That is why I include pictures [in the volumes]…. When you see the big band of people in very elegant tuxedos…you have to forget about your clichés. I hope I have been able to help change the image, but I’m afraid there is still a lot to do.

In the last decade alone, China has transformed into the site of a dynamic art scene. Adrian Gordon, a photographer who was born in China but now works in New York, has attempted to document the recent social shifts in her native country through photography. A selection of her work entitled, “Zhuaji: Photographs of China,” is on display until the end of April at the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies.
 On Wednesday, her photographs were the subject of a frank conversation among art critics and historians about the realities of contemporary China.  Gordon participated in a panel discussion about photographing China with several faculty members from Harvard.  Professor of Asian Art Eugene Wang moderated the panel, which consisted of Boston-based photographer Kris Snibbe, Professor of Photography and chair of the department of History of Art and Architecture Robin E. Kelsey, Professor of History of Art and Architecture and of Visual and Environmental Studies Carrie Lambert-Beatty, MIT Associate Professor of Architectural History Arindam Dutta, and junior fellow of the Harvard Society of Fellows Winnie Wong.
 Gordon recounted her childhood in China and talked with the panel about the significance of her photographs. She said that she hoped to present an “unpackaged” portal into China through her photographs. “I’m interested in imagined futures [in China] that you can no longer imagine,” Gordon said. Wang agreed that Gordon had a unique desire to photograph China. “[She had an] urge to go there with a camera to look for things that may have vanished, to capture and imagine things,” Wang said.
 Gordon said her childhood was spent playing with cameras. One of her playmates was Liu Xiaobo, a currently imprisoned Chinese critic, writer, and human rights activist. “[Gordon’s] unique perspective propelled her to create a documentary and imaginative inquiry into the China of her birth,” Wang said. The panel discussed the original approach that Gordon has taken to China. Neither a tourist nor a conventional foreigner, Gordon says her understanding of China springs from her upbringing and background. 
 “I wanted to portray the personal ghosts of a China that doesn’t exist anymore,” Gordon said. The urban-rural dichotomy of China is a major theme in her photographs, which  feature subjects that sweep the gamut from shopping malls and city streets to the open fields of the Dulong River Valley on the border between China and Myanmar, formerly known as Burma. “I wanted to juxtapose the whiteness, wealth and luxury of these shopping malls against the rural openness of the country,” Gordon said.  Architecture historian Dutta focused on the use of diagonals in the photographs of urban environment. “[This creates] the feeling of being displaced inside this environment of sheer interiority,” he said. 
 Professional photographer Wong marveled at the scope of the exhibit. “[Gordon is] showing all of China, and in particular, Hong Kong and Macau, and how it is culturally and politically and socially distinct but of the same China,” she said. Art historians Wang, Kelsey, and Lambert-Beatty spoke of how the work echoed that of other artists, such as photographer Robert Frank, documentary filmmaker Frederick Wiseman, and pioneering photojournalist Henri Cartier-Bresson. “There are certain tropes and historical moments embedded in the photographs [of Gordon],” Wong said. Panelists situated the work within current trends of photography and critical interpretation, mentioning how Gordon reflects current developments in participatory photography and shifts away from what Lambert-Beatty called “overly critical gestures.”
 “The [contemporary] critique is losing its valency. What is more powerful in a way are the imagined futures that bewilder and pose questions,” Lambert-Beatty said. Gordon was quick to stress that her photos were not altered or manipulated using digital editing software, launching a conversation about authenticity and the struggle for it in both contemporary China and its art. Wang placed this debate within a sociopolitical context.
 “[The] photographic medium [is] a democratizing force, with the deskilling and availability of easy snapshots,” said Wang. These comments led panelists into a discussion of China’s political future and the effect of increased exposure to mass social media and globalization on Chinese society. When Gordon was asked about her aspirations for the exhibit, she said, “I hope it raises questions and that people can resist the impulse to read into it an overarching argument. I hope it brings up a conversation.”
 At once inquisitive and candid, Gordon’s exhibition evokes the vivid colors of China and harks back to past documentarian images of China taken by Western photogrpahers. It suggests that documentary art can serve as more than an anthropological record for a moment in society, but that it can be an instrument for political activism and criticism.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Sure I’ve heard of the Brattle Theatre!” Steve A. Buschbach ’16 says. “Where is it again?”
 
His response was a typical one. Most Harvard students, it seems, are aware of the Brattle Theatre, having passed it en route to Café Algiers or American Apparel or contemplated taking a date there. But of the nearly dozen students I approached, only one had actually patronized the tiny cinema. Preoccupied with extracurriculars, relationships, and spring classes that are quickly exiting the honeymoon phase, the average Harvard student, it seems, has little time to ponder the state of his neighborhood movie theater.
 
The Brattle is not the only one of its kind. While the number of independent movie theaters in the United States has declined over the years, the Boston area boasts an unusually high concentration of non-chain cinemas. Four such independent cinemas are located within five miles of Cambridge: the Coolidge Corner Theatre, located in Brookline; the Somerville Theatre; the Harvard Film Archive; and, of course, the Brattle. Each of these institutions has a rich and decades-long history, and the success these theaters are enjoying in spite of an onslaught of 21st-century technology suggests that the history behind them will continue to accrue.
 
REELS STILL SPINNING
 
It might be expected that the ledgers of local, independent theaters would offer bleak accounts of declining viewership and sinking incomes. But the Cambridge-area independents offer a glorious affront to current trends. Each is comfortably in the black.
 
Ned R. Hinkle has been creative director for the Brattle for twelve years and has been working for the theatre since 1996. His connection to the theater goes back to his high school days, when he was a frequent visitor to the movie house. His account of the Brattle’s financial history since it became a not-for-profit theatre is encouraging. “[The Brattle Film Foundation] took over in March of 2001, then September 11 happened. Corporate money dried up overnight; audiences retreated. But we’ve been able to grow the audience over the years,” he says. “We’ve had three straight years of audience growth.” This is especially impressive given recent patterns for the film industry in general. “While the movies make tons of money, it’s because they keep raising ticket prices. Really, what’s happening is the number of people who go to see movies in movie theaters is declining,” Hinkle says.
 
The Harvard Film Archive has also enjoyed viewership stability. According to Brittany B. Gravely, who studied film at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and has served as publicist for the archive for a little over two years, the archive won’t be in financial trouble anytime soon. “It seems like we have a fairly steady flow of patrons,” she says. “We still have sold-out shows pretty frequently.”
 
The theaters in Harvard Square are not the only ones that have remained solvent over the years. According to employees at both the Coolidge Corner Theatre in Brookline and the Somerville Theatre, audience sizes have remained healthy. “As a whole [viewership] has increased tremendously,” Ian M. Judge, director of operations at the Somerville, says. “We [recently] pushed through to become a first-run movie theatre…. Since then, our attendance has grown.”
 
Judge did acknowledge occasional variations in viewership from month to month, but attributed them to a single factor: “The only fluctuations are when they make terrible movies.” Denise E. Kasell, who once served as the executive director of the Hamptons International Film Festival and is now executive director of the Coolidge, also chalked up attendance dips to the popularity of the films being shown. “We rely on the film industry,” Kasell says.
 
EVERYBODY’S BUSINESS
 
It doesn’t seem that any of these local independents will truly be in jeopardy anytime soon. But in the age of AMC and Netflix (not to mention TiVo, Tivli, Hulu, and HBO Go), how are these tiny theaters continuing to thrive? By each theater’s estimation, the explanation lies in a simple truth: they offer patrons something that other mediums just don’t.
 
The Coolidge’s mission, as described by Kasell, is “to show the best films that we can find, to make them available to our community, to give [our patrons] comfortable seats, and to not bombard them with commercials.” In fact, films at the Coolidge are not prefaced by a single advertisement, but only by short films or trailers. Gravely cited personally and intimately designed programs as well as the large number of visiting directors who accompany their films to the Archive as lending the HFA a unique appeal.
 
Judge spoke of superior presentation, showmanship, and being “tough on cell phones.” He describes the Somerville as a venue which defines itself by breaking the multiplex mold. “[It’s] a down-to-earth, fun, kind of funky place,” he says.
 
That focus on individuality is partially made possible by independent theaters’ approach towards profit. “A national chain…really [has] to program based on how much money they think a movie’s going to make. At the Brattle, while making money is definitely something that people are concerned about, it’s not the be-all-end-all reason for playing a movie,” Hinkle says. “You really want to play a movie you feel passionate about.”
 
For Hinkle, that passion paired with focused, friendly customer service is key. “When your customer service policy is dictated by a corporate structure…inevitably, it feels corporate. At an independent theater, you have a more personable interaction with the people who work here,” he says. “You can come over here and talk to the person who chooses the movies, whereas at an AMC you would never be given access to that person.”
 
DESIGNER PROGRAM
 
The Coolidge’s Box Office Babies program delivers “bi-monthly, baby-friendly screenings of current features.” The Cinema in 70mm program offers screenings of classic, epic films shot on 70mm film, while the Science on Screen program (Kasell’s personal favorite) pairs documentaries and films with a scientific tilt with live lectures by scientific luminaries (the program has been such a success that the Coolidge was given a grant to help implement the program in other theaters). The @fter Midnight program provides local insomniacs with 11:59 p.m. showings of “horrifying, weird, camp, avant garde, tripped-out movies” like “Black Dynamite,” “John Dies at the End,” and “Carrie.” The list of special programs the Coolidge alone offers is formidable, and it represents another characteristic that sets independent theaters apart from an AMC.
 
The Somerville also boasts a varied calendar of events, but regularly ventures outside film. Erected in 1914, the theater first served as an entertainment house for vaudeville acts as well as stage shows and motion pictures. The Somerville is a for-profit theater but is family run and maintains prices comparable to those of their not-for-profit competitors. As befits the theater’s vaudeville roots, it periodically hosts live acts—bands, theater companies, and comedians have all appeared at the Somerville. The theater also serves as the locale for number of film and music festivals. This month, the Somerville will host the Boston Sci-Fi Film Marathon, and in March, the New World Klez Fest will grace its stage.
 
At the Brattle, breadth of programming is emphasized. It is not out of the ordinary for the theater to show “Casablanca” one day and the “All Bugs Revue” the next (in fact, this is what’s on tap this week). This reflects the theater’s commitment to remaining true to its roots. “We program based on some very essential parts that were put together by the people who originally opened the Brattle. They were trying to show films that covered every aspect of what film has to offer: highbrow, lowbrow, classic, new. [Our programming] has evolved in that we do more weird movies now: exploitation movies, B movies, cult movies,” Hinkle says. “We try to find the sweet spot, which is the best movies we can find—the most interesting movies we can find—that will also draw a decent crowd.”
 
PROJECTED BENEFITS
 
Hitting that sweet spot has recently become more difficult due to major changes in the film industry. Traditionally, all movies were printed on physical film and distributed to movie theatres in the form of film reels. This is no longer the case: slowly but surely, digital projection has overtaken film projection as the predominant means by which a movie is screened. Many distributors have stopped producing film reels, and theaters unequipped for digital projection have been faced with an ultimatum: fork over tens of thousands of dollars for a new system, or see the selection of films they are able to screen significantly reduced.
 
“The Brattle’s held out longer than others in terms of practically attacking this problem because we play such a wide range of movies, but we see the writing on the walls. It’s going to affect us within the next eighteen months,” Hinkle says. “This weekend we’re playing ‘The Dark Knight Rises.’ In a year and a half, it’s most likely that a film like that won’t be printed on film.”
 
Further complicating matters is a lack of consensus as to whether digital projection is actually better. Gravely is a staunch advocate for doing things the old-fashioned way. “It’s a real treat to see film on film,” she says. In her opinion, the softening effect of film helps create a sense of movie magic that is lost when a film is digitally projected. “You might as well watch it on a monitor,” she says.
 
Above all, employees at each independent cinema are determined that their theater will not be left behind. The HFA currently has no plans to install digital projectors (given the size of their existing film collection, it is not a grave necessity), but the Somerville and the Coolidge have both undergone partial conversions and are now equipped for both digital and film projection. 
 
The Brattle is currently fixing to follow in its peers’ footsteps. Hinkle described the roughly $80,000 required to install a digital projector as an “unmanageable” amount of money for the Brattle to come up with on its own. Consequently, the theater has turned to Kickstarter, a fundraising company that provides projects in need of capital a platform for collecting pledges. As of yesterday, the campaign has collected pledges amounting to 57,533. The goal is to raise $140,000 to pay for both a digital projector and a new heating and air-conditioning system by the time the campaign concludes on February 28. Due to Kickstarter’s all-or-nothing policy, pledges will only be brought to bear if this goal is met. But Hinkle is excited about the direction of the campaign so far. “The response has been very good…. Some Twitter celebrities have gotten behind us a little bit…. We’re very optimistic about being able to reach the number,” he says.
 
COME TOGETHER
 
Hinkle is also confident about the future of moviegoing in general. He may be on the fence about digital projection; he may bear no great love for Netflix. But on the whole, his is a fountain-drink-half-full philosophy.
“I used to be a real film purist; up until about two years ago [digital projection] really rubbed me the wrong way,” he says. “But what it comes down to for me is, properly projected, whether it’s film or digital, a movie is still magical, and seeing a movie in a theater is still a transporting experience…. It’s really seeing the movie on the big screen, in an audience, that makes the impact.”
 
Kasell is similarly sanguine. She believes firmly that “movie magic” is alive and well. What’s more, she is confident of its ability to endure as technology progresses. “While we can stream everything in our homes, and I watch at least one movie a night at home...sitting in your living room alone or with your family is not the same as gathering with 440 people or 240 people or even 40 people,” she says. The environment created by the theater itself, Kasell suggests, is what matters.
 
Digital, traditional—there is no mention of the mediums of projection in these theaters’ missions, because their goals have far more to do with their atmospheres and customer relations. Kasell suggests that the relationship between theater and audience is what will maintain the appeal of independent theaters. “Everybody knows that we’re not here to take your money; everything that we do stays within the community,” she says. “What I’m really talking about is the communal experience.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In “Paths of Glory,” filmmaker Stanley Kubrick’s 1957 drama of wartime corruption and injustice, an extended tracking shot of runic grace follows Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas) along the length of a trench lined with French soldiers. That same shot will one day follow Jack Nicholson’s demented Jack Torrance as he prowls the endless corridors of the Overlook Hotel in “The Shining.” It’s no coincidence that just as the trench will soon be lined with the corpses of Dax’s men, so the Overlook will shortly become Jack’s tomb, enfolding him in its grisly embrace. The glacial, seemingly inevitable progress of the camera, with its lightness and sepulchral calm, is just the kind of filmic memento mori characteristic of Kubrick, the man who knew everything about movies and precious little about human beings.
“Paths of Glory” and “The Shining” are perhaps Kubrick’s two most redeemable films in that they are inflected with real emotion. That is not to deny their creator’s genius, but only to suggest that his grandest works, in their fiercely ambitious attempts to confront and understand the universe, lack the human grounding that might have made them cherished as well as revered. The Museum of Fine Arts is showing a Kubrick retrospective throughout February in its excellent Remis Auditorium, and it’s the perfect reminder that while hugely important, Kubrick’s immaculate chilliness—sustained by that particular genius which only lapsed into parody on his execrable late films, “Full Metal Jacket” and “Eyes Wide Shut”—probably has no place in modern cinema.
The finest moments in Kubrick’s filmography are usually ones where some passion or pathos breaks through the ice. Douglas’s embittered decency carries “Paths of Glory” to the point where it becomes a cathartic tour de force—the final scene says more about war than anything else in American cinema. Nicholson anchors “The Shining” within the realms of mundanity wherein it becomes far more frightening and intense. “Dr. Strangelove” has Peter Sellers’s improvisatory, comedic talent. The best bits in “2001: A Space Odyssey” are the ones featuring HAL 9000, the self-conscious robot, who displays far more humanity than the virtually anonymous astronauts destroying him.
At their worst, though, Kubrick’s practices and idiosyncrasies seem less like inspiration and more like damaging eccentricity. His insistence on shooting in England renders farcical the several haggard palm trees in “Full Metal Jacket,” especially when compared to other contemporaneous Vietnam films like “Apocalypse Now,” “Platoon,” and “The Deer Hunter,” which were on shot on location. The location is also problematic in “Lolita,” supposedly an American road movie, which looks nothing of the sort. Some of Kubrick’s films carry an annoying air of didacticism as well—“A Clockwork Orange” may not actually say anything particularly insightful about violence, but it certainly thinks it does.
Watching the films again in a cinema, it’s clear that for all their scope and skill and the many thousands of plaudits they continue to receive, nobody makes movies like this anymore, for very good reason. Cinema is as much about empathy as it is about spectacle, art as much about people as it is about ideas. Kubrick is a reminder that sometimes a filmmaker can be almost too talented, too born for greatness. Watch “Paths of Glory” again, not merely his best but also one of the very best, and recall that when he made it in 1957 he was still just Stanley, still just a man, not the great and godlike Kubrick whose films would one day be shown in the halls of fine art museums like plastic, monolithic monuments to the dead. What an achievement! What a necropolis!

  It was an unpredictable road that brought Patrick Douthit––better known as 9th Wonder––from Winston-Salem, North Carolina to lecturing in the Barker Center. That journey took 9th from underground hip-hop darling—via his work with the critically acclaimed group Little Brother—to big-name producer. He has recently worked with Jay-Z and Mary J. Blige. Since 2012, he has held a position as a fellow at The Hiphop Archive at Harvard University, part of the W. E. B. Du Bois Institute in African and African American studies department.9th’s talk––entitled “These Are The Breaks,” which comes from the song “The Breaks” by 1980s and 1990s rapper Kurtis Blow––examined the history of hip-hop through the lens of his own relationship to music.
 9th began by discussing the history of hip-hop culture and also used the music to examine his own life and the songs that inspired him as an artist. Finally, he discussed his own research project, in which he hopes to uncover all the samples used in what he considers the top ten best produced hip-hop albums of all time. To do this, 9th looks at hip-hop like an artist, but also like an archaeologist, examining albums to uncover the samples hidden in plain sight.According to 9th’s lecture, the moment that changed his life forever was when he discovered that the beats behind the hip-hop he loved were based on samples of songs from the 1970s.
 “It is important when you learn that your generation’s music sucks,” he said midway through the talk. This moment of realization triggered a lifelong exploration of the origin of these samples and also prompted a re-examination of the music he listened to as a child.  Most of the talk was biographical, and 9th’s explanation of the history of hip-hop was intertwined with stories from his own life. For example, his description of “It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold us Back”––a classic album released in 1988 by the group Public Enemy––was contextualized by his own experience of the album as a 13-year-old. “It introduced me to black leaders. This didn’t come out of the mouth of my teacher, it came out of the mouth of Chuck D,” he said, referring to genre-defining group’s MC.
 In a question-and-answer session after the talk, Henry Louis Gates Jr., the Alphonse Fletcher University Professor at Harvard University, likened the act of writers borrowing and adapting from each other to the way hip-hop producers sample from other artists when they construct the beats in their songs. He called this practice “hip-hop intertextuality.” Although 9th didn’t use the same terminology, the theme flowed through most of his talk. He focused a large part of his discussion on “crate digging,” the act of D.J.’s and M.C.’s scouring record stores for songs that contain the best “breaks,” or catchiest bits of the songs. “I am digging for the original tracks that led to the samples in the great hip-hop standards,” 9th said.To illustrate this point, 9th Wonder played the samples––often from soul songs of the 1970s and 1980s––behind some of the great albums of the last two decades, such as Jay Z’s “The Blueprint” and Nas’s “Illmatic,” and examined how the producers used these samples to create the albums’ distinctive sounds.
 However, despite the view often repeated in the media that hip-hop artists are “stealing” the music of their forefathers, 9th explained that what was happening was more of an intergenerational exchange between artists. In fact, he actually has a strong relationship with many of the musicians whose work he samples. “They love us now for sampling, because if we didn’t, the music would die,” he said.For 9th Wonder, the work he is doing makes him more than just a record producer. He sees himself as a not only an artist, but also a mix between educator, curator, and librarian. By joining a growing number of hip-hop artists who have taken academic positions––a list that includes The Roots’ frontman ?uestlove, now a lecturer at New York University––he has a chance to not only validate the artform he loves in the face of generally negative media perception, but to also pay homage to the music that allowed hip hop-to rise in the first place. “We travel the world collecting pieces of history to introduce them to a new generation,” he said.

Though the roads taken by artists which lead them to produce creative works can be complex and indirect. The story of John A. Wood is particularly unusual. Wood’s  paintings make up the exhibit “Where, When, and Why,” which is on display until February 28th at the Gutman Library at the Graduate School of Education.
Wood became a painter after an illustrious career as a scientific researcher, meteoriticist, and planetary scientist. Despite having no formal artistic training as a painter, Wood created 21 works in a realist style over the past 10 years.Wood began his career as a geologist at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in 1958. Before retiring from the SAO in 2004, he was a committee member on several advisory committees to NASA, including the STARDUST Discovery Program mission, the Lunar Sample Review Board, and the Mission Definition Team concerned with planning a comet nucleus sample return. In 1973, he was awarded the NASA medal for Exceptional Scientific Achievement, and in 1991, an asteroid was named in his honor.
Today Wood's interests lie not in delving into the mysteries of stardust and distant planet, but in creating works of art that document the everyday reality of places like Harvard, Boston, Cape Cod, New York, Virginia, and France. Wood has transitioned from focusing on a realm known by few to depicting the day-to-day life of the places he has lived, a reality with which countless residents are familiar. These oil paintings illustrate scenes such as city views, a marketplace, and colorful architecture with the realism of a photograph.
At a reception on Wednesday for the gallery opening, Woods talked about his creative influences. “I just always enjoyed art when I was a kid. And as I grew up, I had a career as a scientist for most of my life,” Wood said “And I didn’t have very much time to do art, which always made me sad because I thought I had a certain amount of talent.... When I retired, almost ten years ago now, I thought, okay, I’ll quit science entirely and give art a chance for the rest of my life.”
Set among Wood’s work upon the walls of the Gutman library, the opening reception drew a small mix of graduate students and older professionals from the Cambridge community. The paintings were spaciously mounted throughout the entire first floor reading area, while the refreshments table and mingling area occupied the middle of the room. In this way, Wood’s painting filled the room and surrounded the observers.When deciding on his subject matter, Wood prioritized subjects that he found personally inspiring, over those with more commercial potential. “The things that inspired me are what you see paintings of,” Wood says. “It would be much more strategic in selling paintings if I painted all the same sorts of things…that becomes your brand. It’s a lot easier for a gallery to sell your paintings...And what I’ve done is paint many different kinds of things because many things interest me.”
 Although planetary science and painting are not inherently similar disciplines, Wood nevertheless sees a connection.  “There is interplay,” he said, “It’s not something that I have tried to make anything of. There are many situations and things in science that are really very lovely.” Woods also pointed out that realistic paintings can also help to advance science. “There are people that make a career out of doing scientific art. If you go the National Academy of Science in Washington [D.C.], they have big images on the wall that are taken from nature through a microscope [and] through telescopes. They’re absolutely lovely. There’s no shortage of beauty in nature,” Woods said.Yet, Woods’ transition from scientist to painter was not completely problem-free.
“I think it was naïve of me to think I could simply leave science and become an artist and perform at a professional level and compete with people who have spent their whole lives doing art,” he said. “It would be just as hard for a person that was trained as an artist to just then decide to become a scientist. There are just too many things you wouldn’t know.” 
 Woods’s paintings will be on display at the Harvard School of Education Gutman Library until February 28.  The exhibition is part of a tradition at the Gutman Library, maintaining a gallery that integrates art, specifically local art, into the Harvard Community. Arts in Education graduate student, curator, and gallery manager Ariana Austin says, “We try to leverage a connection and partnership with local organizations and have this be a gateway for students.” An upcoming show in May at the Education School Gallery entitled “Step into Art” will take kids into museums to create their own art inspired by the works they see there on display. Austin says, “This is the School of Education. We really care about people studying the public education system in this country and around the world. So we want their eyes to be filled with [art]... we make it a priority to do a monthly show and an opening reception for every show, every single month without missing a beat. I think it says a lot about valuing the arts and education.” Wood’s work shows that art can an appreciation for art can  come to people with a non-traditional artistic background at all points in life.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Au Bon Pain, the bakery and café chain headquartered in Boston, recently announced that it would completely eliminate eggs from hens raised in battery cages and pork from pigs bred in gestation crates from its U.S. supply chain by 2017. The move, along with similar measures announced by prominent companies like McDonald’s, Burger King, Wendy’s, and Costco, points to the increasing success of consumer activism in bringing about positive, ethical change and the growing success of the food movement.
 Battery cages that house birds in less space than a sheet of paper and gestation crates so small that the sows cannot even turn around are unnecessarily cruel. In both cases, the severe lack of space causes sores, stress, and disease in the animals, making them among the most inhumane practices in factory farming. These intensive confinement systems are so inhumane that they have been banned in a growing number of U.S. states and European nations (in the case of battery cages, in the entire European Union). Additionally, factory farming systems like battery cages and gestation crates are documented environmental hazards. Eliminating the cramped conditions may also enhance food safety, a consideration that has prompted prominent consumer advocacy groups like the Center for Food Safety to oppose battery cages and gestation crates.
 Many food retailers such as Wal-Mart, Safeway, and Trader Joe’s have also announced that they will transition to cage-free eggs. Harvard transitioned to 100 percent cage-free eggs in 2011, but unfortunately, no efforts to eliminate pork raised in gestation crates from its dining menus have been made. In addition, our own Cambridge City Council unanimously passed a resolution calling on all restaurants in the city to switch to cage-free eggs in 2007. These reforms signal a rapid increase in much-needed consumer attention to the ethics of food production in an era of mass industrialization. In the absence of meaningful regulation from our nation’s notoriously scant federal animal welfare laws, we encourage more businesses, both in the Boston area and at large, to follow suit and end their financial support of unethical farming practices.
 While critics may contend that movements for cage-free eggs and gestation crate-free pork are needlessly costly, research has been inconclusive on the economics of gestation crates. In addition, the increased consumer preference for humanely produced foods will draw more suppliers, attracted by the allure of profitability, that will help to decrease current prices. Most compellingly, the agriculture industry cannot justifiably employ ethically and environmentally indefensible practices in pursuit of additional profit. ABP’s reforms are well worth the small additional costs of their implementation.
 The writing is on the wall for companies and suppliers still relying on battery cages and gestation crates. The impact of the food movement is accelerating, and increasing pressure will be placed on businesses to comply with growing consumer demands for ethically sourced food. If not from their own sense of responsibility, businesses should move toward humane treatment of animals in adherence to the age-old maxim: The customer is always right.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In an earlier op-ed, I wrote that peace is about overcoming history. And that is true. But overcoming history does not mean forgetting or ignoring it. Truth must precede reconciliation.  This is a column dedicated to finding creative solutions to the conflict in the Middle East, exploring a variety of narratives. The Midrash says that one can pursue peace between others after he practices peace in his own life. So before I preach to Israelis and Palestinians, I must make my own peace.
At the beginning of last year, I penned an op-ed called “The Hillel Problem.” The piece lambasted Orthodox Jews and their religious practices. Additionally, it derided the Reform movement for its nascent embrace of tradition. For days on end, it was the most read article on The Crimson’s website, the object of pillory and plaudits.
A few months later, I regret ever having published it. Looking back, I made facile assumptions about different streams of Judaism, conflating Reform with Conservative and Modern Orthodox with ultra-Orthodox. Depicting the Orthodox as a monolithic group, I proceeded to make grave charges against them, both explicit and implicit. I caricatured them as undemocratic, insular, medieval, threatening, and disloyal. When it comes to some ultra-Orthodox factions, these criticisms clearly hold. However, the application of these descriptions to the whole Orthodox community was fatuous, journalistically shoddy, and intellectually lazy. It also bore the mark of bigotry. It was wrong. I apologize.
As I spent time at Hillel last semester, I realized that I had grossly mischaracterized the place. Hillel is not Borough Park on Mount Auburn Street. The only three-piece suits there are ones spun from whole cloth. Sideburns there are the product of an outmoded fashion sense, not a fanatic religious devotion. The members of Hillel’s Modern Orthodox minyan do not want to oppress women or impose their beliefs upon a civil state. Just like me, they seek to steer the ship of faith safely through today’s dangerous waters. Fixated on the shoals of modernity, they advocate a more careful, more conservative course.
I question that approach, and I still find certain aspects of Modern Orthodoxy to be objectionable. Men and women are separated at synagogue. Female rabbis are not allowed. Perhaps too much Hebrew is incorporated into the prayer service. Negative attitudes about same-sex relations prevail among religious authorities. These are fundamental disagreements. Since “The Hillel Problem” was published, I have had conversations about these issues with members of the Modern Orthodox community at Harvard. The people to whom I have spoken think deeply about these matters. They are by no means hardened zealots; their love of debate is as legion as any Jew’s.  I am not sure whether our differences can be resolved, or whether they should be. But I do know this: Dialogue is more constructive than diatribe.
I think more critically about what I write and examine closely the language in which I couch my arguments. I am weary of snap judgments. Sometimes, I even pull columns back for further editing and research, as I did this week with an article about the Progressive Jewish Alliance’s Open Hillel campaign. When it comes to Israel vs. Palestine, I know where I stand: I am a liberal Zionist. But “The Rainbow Sign” will not be “The Hillel Problem.” It will engage with opposing points of view instead of straw men. I will talk to everyone, not just those with whom I agree. That’s the sort of journalism that Crimson readers deserve, the sort this subject demands. I expect to bring you nothing less.
Shalom.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Waking up for that difficult Monday class after a long weekend, students feel the failures of Harvard University Dining Services more than ever. If they make it to Annenberg for hot breakfast, students might find that the Hawaiian pizza from the other day has been made over (with an egg on top) as “Breakfast Hawaiian Pizza.” At lunch, it would be understandable if they bypassed the overwhelmingly beige and carb-heavy chicken fingers and fries and instead went to make a sandwich. With luck, there might be mustard available. Students looking for dinner after 7:30 p.m., though, should look elsewhere. And anyone entertaining a hope for food that has not already been served multiple times this semester should go to a restaurant.
These criticisms are not new. HUDS is capable of turning out top-notch food, as they do at the harvest dinner in the fall, formal dinners, and events like the upcoming Brazilian Brunch, but they are incapable of producing high-quality food consistently. In order to overcome these deficiencies and improve the student dining experience, Harvard should shutter HUDS and outsource dining operations to an experienced contractor.
The importance of food quality for students transcends mere nutrition. Dining is a key component of student life. The 2009 Report on Harvard House Renewal concluded that “dining halls are critical to House life” and contained vague recommendations to explore the return of hot breakfast and increased access to after-hours dining options. The USA Today education blog has also noted a speculative link between student happiness and perceived food quality. Schools that rank more highly on Newsweek’s food rankings also tend to appear higher on the student happiness rankings.
In fairness to HUDS, Harvard food is a far cry from revolting. The spring 2012 dining satisfaction survey revealed overall satisfaction with residential dining was 3.87 out of 5, and College Prowler surveys of current students awarded Harvard campus dining an “A.” Moreover, the meal experience can improve once students begin eating in their Houses instead of Annenberg.
HUDS also has to contend with challenges that other schools do not. The tradition of Harvard Houses requires that HUDS operate twelve dining halls plus Annenberg and Dudley House. Across the river, Boston University Dining operates three residential dining halls for an undergraduate population that is 2.5 times larger than Harvard’s. Funneling students to a few large dining halls helps reduce overhead costs so more money can be spent on actual food preparation, but that is simply not an option given Harvard traditions.
Yet the fact remains that Harvard dining should be better. There should be hot breakfast, late night dining options beyond the hit-or-miss brain break fare, and more choice in general. The menu should be varied enough that items rarely appear more than once in a season.
Other schools have managed to meet those challenges by outsourcing to third-party contractors. At Washington University in St. Louis, Wheaton College, and St. Olaf College, dining is provided by Bon Appétit, a dining management company that focuses on sustainability. Princeton Review ranked those three schools in the top 20 for campus food. Other schools use Flik or Chartwells. (All three of these companies are owned by the Compass Group.) They also have options for late-night dining and even serve hot breakfast.
These schools have managed to serve better food while keeping costs low. Board at Harvard is $5,264 this year, compared to $5,318 for the top-of-the-line meal plan at Washington University. At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which uses Bon Appétit, the most expensive plan is $4,635.
The dining issue is not an intractable problem. Yale Dining, which is an in-house operation like HUDS, manages as many dining halls as Harvard, but their top meal plan costs $5,992 per year. Harvard can either choose to make its students spend more money, on par with Yale and use the additional to improve food service, or even better, it can look to schools that have chosen to outsource their food service.
The greatest barrier to outsourcing would be concerns over losing control of staffing and management choices, but Harvard could carefully negotiate its contract to avoid the kinds of pitfalls that Yale experienced when their dining halls were managed by Aramark. The contract could include incentives for increasing satisfaction with dining to prevent the kind of cost-cutting measures that seem to decrease the quality of food that HUDS serves now. Harvard might also run into opposition from dining hall staff, but Harvard could negotiate re-hiring for all or most of them by the new contractor. The staff is not the source of the poor food quality, after all.
More broadly, Harvard has fallen behind other schools in the facilities it offers. In a race to attract students, many universities have spent money on amenities. Harvard has never needed to improve its food or renovate its housing to attract students, but that does not mean it should abandon student quality of life. At a time when some question the wisdom of attending college, when students can simply watch lectures on a computer screen, the value proposition of a school like Harvard is the outstanding student experience. Harvard should not forget that.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The nomination of John O. Brennan as director of the Central Intelligence Agency has renewed a national debate on the role of predator drones in war. Brennan’s nomination reflects President Obama’s steadfast support for these unmanned aircraft. Just last week, a highly controversial Justice Department memo detailing the legal justification for these drone strikes was leaked to NBC News. The document sanctions the killing of American citizens if they are believed to be a “senior operational leader” of Al-Qaeda, even without intelligence indicating an imminent threat to the country. This has led to issues on the potential legality of these killings, not to mention the ethical ramifications of such attacks. But what place do drones have in our society? The public needs to have a serious discussion about a potential legal framework for their use through the establishment of both international and domestic law.
It is easy to think about drone warfare as a uniquely American phenomenon, but that is far from the truth. According to CNN, up to 50 nations currently have or are developing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, in addition to a number of non-state actors such as Hezbollah. As the U.N. Charter already outlaws “arbitrary killings,” not to mention civilian ones, drone strikes constitute a severe threat to the integrity of international law. It is the responsibility of the United Nations, which has a unique ability to enact a system of international accountability, to curb the use of drones. While it may seem an unenviable task to convince the world’s most powerful nation to disarm itself of a crucial weapon, it should be no more difficult than convincing the United States to sign nuclear non-proliferation treaties (1968) or chemical weapons treaty (1997), especially if other nations continue to expand their own rival programs.
Of course, any international deal would be far easier if the United States were to first develop legal guidelines of its own, which could possibly serve as a framework for international negotiations. The U.S. needs to develop an effective balance between efficient systems of eliminating targets and respect for the constitutional rights of terrorists, whatever they may be. Setting current legal issues aside, it is clear that Americans support the use of drone strikes to target terrorists. However, it is also clear that bipartisan support does exist for its regulation. Though neither Democrats nor Republicans will support total prohibition on the use of armed drones, both would support regulations on their use against American citizens, specifically through judicial or congressional oversight of the program.
The first thing that Congress needs to do is establish a legal framework for the constitutional rights of terrorists. Though U.S. Attorney General Eric H. Holder maintains that the Constitution does not cover terrorists, the Supreme Court declared in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld that U.S. citizens have the right of due process under law. Currently, the government is making the case that this only applies to detained terrorists rather than those on the battlefield. Therefore, congressional Democrats have some leeway to enact legislation.
In exchange for the legalization of the targeting of U.S. citizens, Democrats could concede a system of judicial oversight on specific killings. Though the details of such proceedings—including the names of those on the “kill list”—would not necessarily have to be public, its mere occurrence would go a long way toward maintaining the stability of the legal process. To further ensure transparency and the efficacy of this program, some or all details could be released a certain period after the killing of the given target, either to a congressional committee or to the public at large. This mix of executive orders and congressional and judicial overview would sustain America’s system of checks and balances while still maintaining the confidential nature of the war on terror.
It is also imperative that Congress pass a more general system of regulations on who—specifically, which U.S. citizens—may be targeted through drone strikes. One such regulation could require that targets pose an “imminent” threat to the United States—though the meaning of the word "imminent" may have to be clarified. Reform of the United States’ internal drone program can lead to leverage with Pakistan, on whose soil America continually targets enemy combatants. Ideally, this would strengthen Pakistan’s tenuous cooperation in the war on terror.
The United States has a right and responsibility to eliminate terrorists that pose a threat to our national security. However, we must ensure that first and foremost our Constitution is upheld and that we act within our bounds, specifically when dealing with U.S. citizens. We must also learn to cooperate with the rest of the world on this sensitive issue. Predator drones can be great tools in the war on terror, but it is our responsibility to establish their roles and limitations.

Today’s young Americans ages 18 to 29 are more racially diverse than any generation before them, more likely to be unemployed than those older than them, and more politically active than young people of the recent past, according to an ambitious new study co-sponsored by Harvard’s Institute of Politics.
At the same time, half of the so-called millennial generation do not vote, and more than 40 percent believe their vote does not matter in a broken Washington.
“Millennials are participating in politics—we can see that. But they’re not really participating in governing,” IOP Director C.M. “Trey” Grayson ’94 said. “So for us, that’s probably the next step. We’ve learned how to promote political engagement, so how do we promote governmental engagement?”
The findings are part of a new index of civic engagement which aims to account for broad educational, economic, and other demographic differences among the country’s 46 million millenials.
Among a broad range of findings, the index showed that, though 62.9 percent of young people are employed, 31.2 percent of those people are only working on a part-time basis.
Those with more education are more likely to be civically engaged, though not necessarily more socially cohesive, according to the study.
Millennials, who comprised just over 21 percent of the eligible voting population during last November’s election, favored President Barack Obama by more than 20 points—a margin large enough to tip the electoral contest in his favor.
“Americans 18 to 29 made a big difference in the 2012 presidential election, but at the same time, only half of them showed up,” said Matthew E. Warshauer ’14, chair emeritus of the IOP’s Public Opinion Project.
The unprecedented report is the combined effort of four national research organizations focused on civic participation—the National Conference on Citizenship, Mobilize.org, the Tufts-based Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement, and the IOP.
“The goal of this report was really to bring together all the knowledge of these different groups to really understand millennial engagement, and, based on that understanding,... use this information to build a stronger civic foundation among Americans 18 to 29,” Warshauer said.
The partnership represents a broadening of focus for the IOP, which has traditionally dedicated most of its research efforts to conducting a biannual political survey of young voters.
The IOP did issue a civic engagement index similar to the new report last spring, but that project was limited to the state of Massachusetts.
“We’ve earned a really strong reputation for our understanding of the millennials with the surveys we do every semester, so we really want to be able to go beyond just the survey,” Grayson said.

Five years after filing a gender discrimination lawsuit against Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School professor Carol A. Warfield has reached a $7 million settlement with the Harvard-affiliated teaching hospital. Observers say that the agreement, which also stipulates that the hospital rename its pain center in Warfield’s honor, is one of the largest gender discrimination settlements ever to be publicly disclosed in Massachusetts.
Warfield, who sits on the Harvard Medical School faculty and was the first woman with an endowed chair at the Medical Center, filed a lawsuit in March of 2008 alleging gender discrimination and retaliation on the part of hospital leadership.
Ellen J. Zucker, Warfield’s attorney, said that along with the settlement payment, the renaming of the pain center, and compensation for lost income, the hospital has also agreed to sponsor an annual lecture series on women’s contributions to surgery. In addition, it will “reaffirm and...clarify its policies and procedures to ensure that all employees have mechanisms available to them to raise concerns about discrimination and retaliation,” Zucker said.
A joint statement released last week by the involved parties said that, while they have “resolved their differences,” the defendants, who include former Medical Center Chief of Surgery Josef E. Fischer and former Medical Center president and CEO Paul F. Levy, admit no wrongdoing on their parts. Levy and Fischer’s attorney Richard D. Glovsky both declined requests for comment on the case Monday afternoon.
Warfield’s 2008 complaint alleged that over a period of years Fischer disrespected Warfield—who was then the chair of the hospital’s anesthesia department—and her female colleagues, The complaint also claimed that Levy failed to address the discrimination complaints brought forward by Warfield. Despite additional complaints to hospital leadership and an investigation of Fischer’s and Warfield’s relationship which found fault with Fischer, the misconduct allegedly continued, and Warfield was dismissed from her chair position in July 2007.
The defendants attempted to keep the matter in arbitration, but the Suffolk Superior Court denied that request and sent the dispute to trial. The trial would have began last week had the settlement not been reached. In the joint statement, the hospital’s General Counsel Jamie Katz said that the hospital is pleased that the matter has been resolved and looks forward to serving the community—a goal shared by Warfield and the rest of the hospital’s staff.
“This case serves as a reminder that, with time and consideration, people of goodwill can learn from one another,” Katz said in the statement.
Zucker said that the settlement was “enormously gratifying.”
“It’s an unusual resolution, because it was not just about damages, a sum of money, and everyone going their separate ways,” Zucker said.
Warfield, who joined the Medical Center’s staff in 1980, called the hospital “an institution I’ve loved for the past 35 years,” and said she hopes the outcome of her case could help other Medical Center staff and faculty.
“I’m really heartened by the fact that the hospital has taken this opportunity to move forward and reaffirm their commitment to women, to equal opportunity,” Warfield said.
Zucker said that her client’s “courage and willingness to stay the course” was aimed at making a difference for others as well as herself.
“As a lawyer, it’s a good day when you get a deserving client a resolution with which they are content,” Zucker said. “It’s a great day when you get a resolution not only for them, but for others.”

Disaster was the theme of Monday night’s City Council meeting, as councillors reviewed Cambridge’s blizzard response and recalled last fall’s city-wide blackout.
The Council stressed the need for Cantabrigians to be patient this week, as the city embarks on the blizzard cleanup process. Hoping to ease the burden on Cantabrigians, the Council also adopted an order asking City Manager Robert W. Healy to waive parking fees at the First Street Garage this week.
Both Councillor Marjorie C. Decker and Councillor Craig A. Kelley said that constituents had contacted them during the blizzard to report streets that the Department of Public Works had not plowed. The two councillors also commended city employees for their diligence during the storm.
“Our city employees probably hear more of the complaints that come through rather than the thanks that they deserve,” Decker said.
Mayor Henrietta J. Davis also praised the Department of Public Works for its storm response. Acknowledging that the response might have seemed slow to some Cantabrigians, she added, “The crews do have to sleep.”
Decker also expressed her appreciation for Cambridge residents’ patience and cooperation during the storm.
“I just would like to thank our residents for doing the backbreaking work of clearing their sidewalks,” she said.
The Council also turned its attention to last November’s city-wide blackout as part of a larger conversation about concerns with NSTAR Electric and Gas, the city’s electricity provider. Councillors said that several Cambridge businesses had found the utility company unable to meet their ampage needs.
“We ought to be concerned about the adequacy of the infrastructure that NSTAR has,” said Councillor Kenneth E. Reeves ’72. Reeves cited the “bedlam” that ensued in Central Square during the Nov. 29 blackout as evidence of the immediacy of the problem.
Kelley deemed it “ironic” that the Council was approving large-scale development plans in Cambridge while problems with NSTAR persisted.
“We ought to know more about NSTAR’s capacity before encouraging further building,” he said.
The Council ultimately adopted an order requesting that the City Manager meet with NSTAR officials. The order, sponsored by Reeves and Councillor Leland Cheung, called for a “firm timeline for maintenance and replacement plans.”

Boston’s fifth biggest snowstorm on record was mighty enough to temporarily close down state roads, halt Harvard operations, and postpone the freshman formal this past weekend. But it did not deter Falafel Corner employee Ibrahim Souz, who voyaged out into the swirling snow to deliver a take-out meal to a hungry customer on Friday night.
Falafel Corner, which served Middle Eastern cuisine until 3 a.m. Saturday morning, was among several businesses in Harvard Square that decided to brave the weekend’s blizzard­. Despite warnings from local and state authorities, some stores ran operations into the wee hours of Saturday morning. More chose to re-open on Saturday morning or afternoon.
For the eateries that stayed open, business as usual in a mostly shuttered Harvard Square meant big crowds and unusual challenges.
“We were crazy busy because no one else was open,” said Falafel Corner owner Ahmed Naguib. “We really sacrificed a lot to be here and especially do deliveries.”
Felipe’s Taqueria, a Mexican restaurant in The Garage, stayed open until 9:30 p.m. on Friday and resumed regular business hours at 11 a.m. on Saturday, sacrificing only five hours of its regular operations schedule to the blizzard.
“Felipe’s has been open for nine years now, and we have never closed early or opened up late,” said Thomas J. Brush, the restaurant’s co-owner. “We knew about [the blizzard] ahead of time, so we didn’t run out of ingredients or have any problems.”
Biswa Tiwari, a shopkeeper at Tommy’s Value, slept in the convenience store’s basement on Friday night to make sure that the store could keep its regular hours of 7 a.m. to 3 a.m. Tiwari, like others who stayed open, said that his decision to continue operations during the blizzard was good for sales.
“I won’t give exact numbers, but we had a more than 50 percent increase in business,” Tiwari said.
Business was so good that other shops, such as convenience store CVS, were depleted of items by early Friday evening.
“It was a hundred times worse than Hurricane Sandy,” CVS store manager Bill Mahoney said. “Our shelves were wiped out. There was no milk, no bread, no chips, no anything.”
Despite high profits, several stores that chose to stay open were understaffed due to the traffic ban placed on the Commonwealth by Governor Deval L. Patrick ‘78.
Many store managers felt compelled to close before the ban went into effect at 4 p.m. on Friday so that workers could get home safely.
“We wanted to allow staff to get home safely and decided to play it safe,” said Pinocchio’s Pizza & Subs owner Adam DiCenso, who shuttered his store early on Friday.  “Once the ban was lifted, four of us were able to get the ovens running and get back at it.”
Businessowners said that their motivation to stay open—or re-open as early as possible—was ultimately to serve the public.
“It’s not all about the money and that,” Brush said. “Everyone was just so appreciative that we were open, and they were thanking us again and again.”

Harvard affiliates shared their experiences with discrimination and lack of workplace diversity during a discussion at the Office of Career Services on Monday. Guest speakers—a mixture of Harvard alumni and Harvard-affiliated professionals—provided advice and strategies for identifying and handling issues on the job at the event, entitled “Navigating a Less Diverse Workplace.”
One female speaker of mixed minority descent said that new clients often assume her inferiority to male colleagues.
Another speaker, the only Latino member of an investment bank summer associate program, said he felt he had to work harder than the average employee to establish himself as a valuable contributor.
During audience introductions, a senior voiced her concern over past interviews in which she had been probed about identifying as a gay woman and the implications it posed for her career and family plans.
The discussion touched on identifying and responding to subtle instances of workplace discrimination in which individuals are unsure whether they are being discriminated against. Two categories of discrimination were highlighted: barriers to entry and hindrances to success within an organization. The speakers urged students to be assertive and aware that stereotypes can be changed.
“We’ve had students who go into our recruiting [program] and everyone who interviews them is a white male, or has very different political beliefs,” said Robin E. Mount, director of career, research and international opportunities at OCS. How do you approach this situation? How do you decide that this is a place that is welcoming for you?”
Speakers emphasized the importance of screening potential employers to find a workplace environment that excites them while also looking good on paper.
Event attendee Denise Acosta ’15 said she learned much from the discussion.
“[This is] not something you get in the classroom—you learn it by meeting people, talking to people, hearing their stories. Coming from a Mexican-American background, sometimes it’s really comforting to see people like you who have made it,” said Acosta. “Just realizing discrimination exists and having strategies to work around it makes all the difference.”

Speaking at a recruiting event for the Harvard Management Company on Monday, HMC President and CEO Jane L. Mendillo said she recently has been “more conscious about trying to recruit” Harvard students to work for the Company, which oversees the University’s investments.
“What I would like to do is entice some of you into working [for the HMC],” Mendillo told a crowd of about 40 students, including members of finance-related student organizations and supporters of the movement for socially responsible investment at Harvard.
In 2009, the HMC—which manages the University’s $30.7 billion endowment—began hiring summer interns from Harvard. Currently, 19 of the company’s employees are Harvard graduates.
According to Mendillo, the endowment represents an increasingly large percentage of the University’s operating budget, partially due to decreasing tuition revenue. In this environment, HMC’s portfolio has succeeded in part because of its diversity.
“We probably have the most international, the most global, portfolio of any endowment,” she said.
After her presentation, Mendillo fielded questions about financial management and responsible investment.
In response to a question about the potential conflict between Harvard’s mission and investment strategy, Mendillo told students that any investment that is not supportive of Harvard’s mission “does not belong in the portfolio.”
In the same vein, one attendee asked about her view on the creation of the social choice fund, which the University announced in December.
“It’s a challenging area,” Mendillo said. “Not everybody sees social choice and socially responsible investment in the same way.”
She added that the the new social choice fund will be “very small” and will not necessarily be able to take advantage of the investment strategies applied for Harvard’s larger funds.
Following the talk, Parker G. Clemans ’16, who is in the Veritas Financial Group and the Harvard Financial Analysts Club, said he is “definitely going to consider” recruiting for HMC in the future.
Students who did not come to the event for recruiting purposes still said they found the event educational.
Casper R. ter Kuile, a Havard Kennedy School student and a member of Responsible Investment at HKS, said that he was “really encouraged” to hear Mendillo’s take on aligning Harvard’s philosophy with its investments.

Harvard Divinity School professors reacted with surprise—and, in some cases, comprehension—to Pope Benedict XVI’s historic announcement Monday that he will resign as head of the Roman Catholic Church at the end of this month.
In an announcement delivered in Latin to a crowd of cardinals, the 85-year-old German pontiff said that he no longer has the strength to carry on in his position. He will officially step down on Feb. 28, ending an eight-year papacy that was often rife with controversy.
For many, including Divinity School professor Kevin J. Madigan, the news came as a shock.
“I do not think anyone saw this coming, including bishops and archbishops around the world,” Madigan wrote in an email.
Yet other faculty members were less surprised. Divinity School professor Francis S. Fiorenza, who is a former student of the pope, said that his old teacher had “dropped hints” of an impending resignation in previous public statements.
“In several interviews, he said if he felt he was too frail or too sick to do the job that he would resign... So for him to retire at 85 makes perfect sense,” Fiorenza said.
Divinity School professor Francis X. Clooney wrote in an email that, although Benedict’s decision to step down seems shocking and novel, the act of resignation was “not in itself very significant.”
“There was/is no rule that a pope has to serve for life. Benedict is a sober and sensible man; we all live longer these days, and he seems to have recognized his mortality, and the limits of his strength,” Clooney said.
Though Benedict is the first pope to have stepped down in almost 600 years, many—including Benedict’s late predecessor Pope John Paul II—have faced deteriorating conditions in their final years. Madigan speculated that this history may have influenced Benedict’s decision.
“I am sure that, having witnessed John Paul II’s slow physical and mental decline, even as he continued to hold the office of pope, he did not wish to decline in the same way, publicly and while holding the highest office in the church,” Madigan wrote.
Professors also said that Benedict’s resignation inevitably raises questions about the path of succession.
While Fiorenza voiced doubt that an American will fill the position, saying he believes that the next pope will be someone who has had extensive Vatican experience in the last few years, Clooney suggested that the transition could prompt renewal.
“It is always notable when there is the prospect of a new pope coming into office, since this makes possible new ideas and change in the Church,” Clooney wrote.
Clooney added that he expects that the swiftly approaching selection process, which slated to be complete before Easter Sunday on March 31, will leave the Vatican in flux.
“That the election of a new pope will happen on relatively short notice, without much preparation, creates an uncertain situation, possibly a dramatic one,” Clooney said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Speaking to an audience in Sanders Theatre that included University President Drew G. Faust, a panel of professors from Harvard and the University of Michigan on Monday night urged both citizens and businesses to make environmental activism their top priority.
During the event, panelists stressed the importance of building a consensus that motivates individuals and corporations to act, rather than just passively voicing concern about climate change.
According to panelist and Harvard government professor Stephen D. Ansolabehere, polls show that most Americans say they are concerned about climate change, but are reluctant to do anything about it once costs are mentioned.
“People are of two minds about global warming,” he said.
By way of a solution, Ansolabehere suggested that the climate change discussion be framed in the context of deeply personal local issues, rather than as an abstract concept. Panelist and Harvard Kennedy School lecturer Marshall L. Ganz ’64-’92 said that environmental activist movements need to create a sense of both urgency and hope in order to get people to act.
He cited other social campaigns, like the Civil Rights Movement, that worked at “changing people and how they thought.”
University of Michigan professor Andrew J. Hoffman argued that today’s public must fundmantally shift its attitude regarding environmentalism, just as the 19th century public shifted its views on slavery during the abolitionist movement.
Harvard Business School professor Rebecca M. Henderson stressed the importance of getting businesses involved as well as individuals. She said that some firms are following investment guidelines that take sustainability into account while preserving returns. She added that universities would be wise to “ally” themselves with this type of investment.
At the end of the panel, Faust stepped out of her seat and onto the stage. She wrapped up the event by saying that activism necessitates “mobilizing universities” in order to “support the best of human life.”
Audience members said that they generally appreciated the panelists’ discussion of environmental activism outside of a scientific framework.
“I think it was really interesting to see Harvard faculty involved in different areas we wouldn’t normally associate with the issue,” said Alli J. Welton ’15, who is a board member of Divest Harvard, Harvard’s chapter of environmental activism group Students for a Just and Stable Future. “In terms of really making a difference, we need the political scientists to be talking about it.”

BOSTON—The Harvard men’s hockey team has won only two games in the last three months, but the Crimson continues to have Boston University’s number.
Harvard won its first game Monday night since a dramatic overtime win over the Terriers on Jan. 9 by defeating No. 13 BU, 7-4, in the Beanpot consolation game at TD Garden.
After falling behind, 2-0, the Crimson scored five of the next six goals in a dominant offensive performance while freshman Peter Traber made 43 saves to earn his first career victory.
In its last two wins over the Terriers, Harvard has scored more goals than it did in the nine games in between.
“My first comment to [Harvard coach] Teddy Donato is that they should play us all the time,” BU coach Jack Parker said. “They manhandled us.... It was nowhere near the type of effort we need.”
Just over a minute and a half into the second period, BU’s Evan Rodrigues scored a power-play goal to put the Terriers ahead, 3-2.
But from there, seniors Luke Greiner and Marshall Everson went on an offensive tear, registering two tallies each during a 20-minute span.
Everson scored first, tying things up two minutes after Rodrigues’ goal when he took a behind-the-net pass from rookie Kyle Criscuolo and fired it home from the slot.
“We’ve been trying to work the puck down low,” Greiner said. “Tonight we did a good job behind the net and springing some guys in front.”
Just a minute later, Greiner snagged a pass from classmate Conor Morrison and beat Maguire to give Harvard a 4-3 lead.
At the 16:33 mark of the period, the forward was at it again, this time on the power play. Greiner’s second score of the game, off passes from senior Danny Biega and freshman Brian Hart, put the Crimson up, 5-3.
Late in the period, BU’s Alexx Privitera was thrown out of the contest after he kneed senior forward Alex Fallstrom, who remained down for a few moments before slowly getting up.
BU was able to kill the ensuing overlapping five-minute power play, but just seconds after it ended, Everson collected a Fallstrom rebound in the slot and fired past Maguire to put Harvard up, 6-3, with 16:47 to go.
“Our senior group, I thought, carried the day for us,” Donato said. “It was nice to see them have such a big night.”
Cason Hohmann squeezed a rebound past Traber from the left corner of the net with 8:35 remaining to cut the deficit to two, but the rookie was able to withstand heavy pressure and hold the lead the rest of the way. Greiner completed his first career hat trick with an empty-netter with eight seconds to go.
“[Traber] made a lot of huge saves and he looked strong in there,” Donato said. “It’s nice to see him get his first win.”
The Terriers got on the board three minutes into the game after a Traber save attempt deflected right to Mike Moran, who had an empty net to put it away.
BU expanded its lead to 2-0 at the 11:45 mark of the opening period with a shorthanded score. With Harvard on a power play, the Terriers’ initiated a two-on-one against Biega in the offensive zone. Wade Megan took a pass took a pass from Hohmann and beat Traber to put the Terriers up, 2-0.
But Harvard answered right back 75 seconds later when junior defenseman Dan Ford put home a rebound for his first goal of the season, cutting the Terriers lead to 2-1.
Biega tied the game with 14.2 seconds remaining in the period. After taking a big hit from the Terriers’ Patrick MacGregor along the right boards, the captain got up, intercepted a BU clear attempt, and fired a shot through Maguire’s legs to tie the game.
“I knew I was going to get hit,” Biega said. “Luckily the puck squirted back out. I just remember shooting it as hard as I could and luckily it went in.”
Harvard would go ahead in the subsequent period and not lose its lead for the remainder of a contest that saw a total of 17 penalties.
The performance handed the Terriers just their fifth fourth-place Beanpot finish ever and its worst tournament loss since falling to Harvard, 9-6, in the 1989 title game. The Crimson’s seven goals—which came despite the squad being outshot, 47-31—was its most in a Beanpot contest in 12 years and improved Harvard’s record to 16-20 all-time in consolation contests.
Biega said he hoped the win would spark the team to a late-season run, just as a consolation victory over the Terriers two years ago spurred a struggling Crimson squad to seven wins in its next eight games.
“I think [this victory] has the ability to turn the team around,” Biega said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Junior co-captain Adabelle Ekechukwu broke the Ivy League record in the women’s weight throw at the annual HYP track and field meet this past weekend in Princeton, N.J.  Her winning throw of 20.11 meters makes her the first woman in Ivy League history to break the 20-meter mark.
Ekechukwu’s performance helped the Crimson to a second-place finish in the meet with 55 points. Princeton won with a total of 79 points, and Yale finished third with 25.
The women’s weight throw featured a showdown between Ekechukwu and the freshman standout from Princeton, Julia Ratcliffe. Ratcliffe, the record holder in her home country of New Zealand, set a personal best of 19.74 meters, but it was no match for Ekechukwu, who broke the record on the first of her five attempts with a 20.03-meter toss. The junior’s third attempt was her best of the day, as she turned in her record-breaking third throw of 20.11 meters.
“I knew who my competitor was,” Ekechukwu said. “[Julia Ratcliffe], on the Princeton team, who has been having a very good indoor season as well. I just came in with a very competitive mindset. I was ready to go after her.”
Ekechukwu, who is also a Crimson arts and multimedia editor, dominated last year’s HYP meet at Harvard, beating her next closest competitor by more than two meters. However, Ratcliffe held the Ivy League record coming into this year’s HYP meet, having set it at 19.69 meters earlier this year at the Princeton Quad Meet on Jan. 16.
“I knew she was going to be a good competitor,” Ekechukwu said. “But my coach was telling me that it is not really good to be going after numbers…. So while I was expecting to put up a fight against her it wasn’t really my main concern. I was just concerned with doing well for myself and doing well for my team.”
Head coach Jason Saretsky acknowledged the competition between the junior and freshman, and was glad to see Ekechukwu get the better of Ratcliffe.
“Adabelle has certainly stepped up to that challenge [from Ratcliffe],” Saretsky said. “And she’s done a remarkable job not only matching her, but surpassing her.”
First-year throwing coach Andrew Dubs has only been working with the team since September, when he took over for Cathrine Eriksen, who is now the director of cross country and track and field at Northeastern. In this short period of time, Dubs has had a strong impact on the Harvard throwers, Ekechukwu in particular.
“I was just really pleased with Adabelle and the way she performed and competed,” Dubs said. “She was very focused all day leading up to the meet and she was on fire once the competition started.”
After its performance this weekend, the Crimson now look ahead to the Heptagonal Championships set to take place at Gordon Indoor Track Feb. 23 and 24th.
“I think it was good that Adabelle was able to get the first strike in there with her victory.” Dubs said. “Now hopefully we can duplicate that in a couple weeks and come out on top.”
The junior is also looking forward to the opportunity to compete at her home track.
“I am just excited for the crowds that will be there,” Ekechukwu said. “I am excited for the energy that the women’s team is going to bring, and I am just excited for my teammates to do well in general.”
As the competition approaches, Dubs knows Ekechukwu won’t lose focus in practice.
“It is a pleasure to come to work everyday, and to go to practice with her,” Dubs said. “She is very dedicated and a very hard worker, just a pleasure to be around.”
Though he was pleased with Ekechukwu’s record-breaking performance, Saretsky thinks the future may be even brighter for his junior co-captain.
“[Ekechukwu] has been ready for this for a while now,” Saretsky said,” So it was fantastic to see things finally click…. I still think there’s more to come [from her].”
While these may seem like lofty expectations, Saretsky believes that Ekechukwu has what it takes to excel both in the Ivy League and beyond.
"She’s got all the things you look for in a national-caliber thrower,” Saretsky said. “She’s got a great work-ethic. She’s fast, explosive, and extremely strong. All the tools that you look for, she’s got. And the most important part of it is the heart. She really is passionate about what she does and is really committed to this."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Playing the Terriers may have just been what Harvard needed.
 
Last week, Northeastern defeated No. 13 BU (13-12-1, 10-7-1 Hockey East) in the Beanpot for the first time in 25 years.  Consequently, the Terriers ended up facing off against Harvard in just its fourth consolation game in the last 30 years.
 
Coming into Monday’s contest, the Crimson had only won one game in its last 16–the sole victory coming against BU on Jan. 9, where they came back from two 3-goal deficits to win, 6-5, in overtime.
 
The Harvard men’s hockey team (6-15-2, 3-12-1 ECAC) again found itself down on separate occasions, trailing 2-0 in the first period and 3-2 in the second.
 
But in a season characterized by  a number of lows, the Crimson was able to fight back as it did over a month ago against the same Terrier squad. 
 
Harvard scored three goals in the second and two more in the third, capped off by senior Luke Greiner’s first career hat trick, to defeat BU, 7-4, to clinch third place for the 16th time in Beanpot history.
SENIOR RESILIENCE
This was a night for the seniors, with six of the seven Crimson goals coming off the sticks of these Beanpot veterans.
 
“I was happy that our senior group carried the day for us today and it was nice to see them have such a big night,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said.
 
It started on an inspiring play from the captain, Danny Biega, that knotted the score at two at the close of the second period.
 
After being dealt a crushing hit from BU junior defenseman Patrick MacGregor near the right boards, the Crimson all-American was quickly able to get back off his feet, pick up the puck by the right circle, and fire a shot low and to the right, past Terrier netminder Sean Maguire.
 
Though BU would retake the lead at the beginning of the third, Harvard soon responded with two quick goals by senior Marshall Everson and Greiner. Both of these goals displayed the Crimson’s strength behind the net, with strong, winning play that led to passes up in front of the Terrier goal.
 
“We’ve been trying to work the puck down low,” Greiner said. “We got some guys who can really play down there and hang onto it, and tonight we did a good job getting behind the net and springing some guys out front.”
 
Greiner added another on the power play, and Everson made it 6-3 with a rebound goal of his own; Greiner finished off the game with an empty net goal with 8.6 seconds left in the game. 
CONTINUING TREND?
The last time Harvard exited the rink after playing BU, the team had just snapped a six-game winless streak and looked poised to make a strong run into the rest of the season. Monday night they exit the TD Garden having snapped a nine-game winless streak and as recent history has showed, again looked poised to make a strong run down the stretch.
 
BU’s loss marked the first time since 1961 and 1963 that the Terriers squad has lost two out of three years in the consolation game. Its loss in 2011 sparked a Harvard run that ended one game away from the ECAC semifinals, despite a similar disappointing start to the season. 
 
With nine NHL draft picks on the roster and a No. 3 ranking in the ECAC preseason polls, the Crimson seemingly has the talent to move up the standing, even though it currently sits in last.
 
A positive sign in this Beanpot matchup was the work by freshman goalie Peter Traber. Earning his first career win, Traber shook off a soft goal in the first period to come back and make a career-high 43 saves, countering the Terriers’ 43-31 shot advantage. 
 
As it hopes for continued strong play from its seniors and high-scoring freshmen, Harvard will look to turn its season around in the final few games remaining on its schedule.
 
“I think [this game will] immensely help, and it has the ability to turn the team around,” Greiner said. “It hasn’t been too great of a run the first half of the season, but that’s the great thing–everyone makes the playoffs and we can to start to pick it up and roll off this, and I think a lot of good things are going to come.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Adabelle Ekechukwu’s stellar record-breaking weight throw won the junior co-captain of the women’s track and field team our Athlete of the Week honor, but several other athletes also had performances worthy of recognition by The Back Page.
Emerance Maschmeyer, Women’s Hockey
In last week’s Beanpot women’s semi-final, the freshman goalie made a career-high 34 saves, shattering her previous high of 22. Despite her best efforts, the Crimson still came up short as Boston College won by a 2-1 margin.  Maschmeyer had a save percentage of .944, consistent with her season mark of .940, despite the fact that she was under fire far more against the No. 2 ranked Eagles than she has been all season. Throughout the first two periods, the goalkeeper managed to hold Boston College scoreless, quickly racking up more saves than in any of her previous games before the final period even began. In the third period, however, the Eagles managed to score twice to secure the win in a hotly contested game. Maschmeyer is now 7-2 on the season, splitting starts with senior Laura Bellamy (10-1-1).
Victoria Lippert, Women’s Basketball
On Sunday afternoon, the senior led Harvard’s women’s basketball team to an important overtime victory over Ivy League rival Cornell. Lippert was incredibly impressive on the offensive end, turning in an immensely efficient performance while leading Harvard in points with 19. She shot six for 11 from the floor (55%) and six for six on free throws. Thirteen of her points came in the second half, when she scored over half of the Crimson’s points as the game went into overtime. The guard also added four offensive rebounds to round off an 69-point offensive effort. Lippert has started every game this season for the Crimson and is second on the team in points per game (12.5).
Marshall Everson, Men’s Hockey 
The Harvard men’s hockey team ended its eight game losing streak on Sunday with a 1-1 tie against Dartmouth thanks to an important goal by its senior leader. Down by a goal after Dartmouth scored in the first period, the forward came back and scored a power-play goal to tie the game and end the skid. He was assisted on the play by senior Alex Fallstrom and sophomore Colin Blackwell. Everson is second on the team in goals with five and has played in every game this season.

Today marks Abraham Lincoln's 204th birthday, and to celebrate, Flyby brings you some interesting tidbits about our favorite Badass in Chief. 
Rugged Revolutionary
 Even if he was president during the Civil War, Lincoln was one of our most revolutionary presidents. Case in point: the tall, dark, and dapper leader rocked the rugged look and was the first president to sport a beard.
Presidential Player
 Our man Abe also had a lot of game. He allegedly approached his future wife, Mary Todd, at a party and said, "I want to dance with you in the worst possible way." He won her heart over fellow suitor and presidential competitor, Stephen A. Douglas.
Vertically Gifted
Not only did Lincoln steal Douglas's date and own him during the debates, he also towered over his rival. At 6'4", Lincoln was our nation's tallest president and had Douglas beat by a foot.
Rustic Charm
Lincoln had quite the accent, pronouncing "get" as "git" and "there" as "thar." Guess his country roots never quite left him.
Vampire Slayer
Although our 16th president didn't actually slay any vampires, he definitely could have. In addition to his axe-wielding prowess, Lincoln was a champion wrestler and once defeated an opponent with a single toss.
Harvard Dad
Lincoln's eldest son, Robert Todd Lincoln, attended Harvard starting in 1860. He lived in Hollis 25. Unfortunately, Papa Abe wasn't able to make it to his son's commencement ceremony.

Stressed over the state of our union or depressed about the terrible weather? Continue putting off your countless pages of reading and psets and get your B.A.C. to the level of the national debt.
 
Here are Flyby's rules to ensure that your Tuesday night gets as sloppy and inappropriate as Biden's smile.
Anytime Obama employs one of his favorite oratorical tools—the dramatic pause—do a waterfall with the group until he starts talking again. (A waterfall is when one person starts, the person sitting next to them starts drinking, and so on around the circle—make sure to choose a different starting person everytime.)
Whenever the cameras flash to Michelle, the last person to finish five pushups has to take a drink.
Anytime the camera is on someone yawning, the group gets to choose one person to take a drink.
(If Biden is caught yawning—finish your drink.)
When the camera pans to Mitt Romney, stop drinking you anti-Mormon!
When Boehner cries—two drinks.
If Obama brings up immigration, smuggle a tequila shot across the border (of your lips).
If he brings up abortion—one belly shot. Gun control—shotgun a beer. Gay marriage—pair up with someone of the same gender, hook arms, and take a drink.
If Obama actually concisely tells us what the state of the union is, finish your drink.
If you're still alive/standing/conscious by the end of the program, drink until you are hopeful about the future of this country/the world.
Have fun getting Commander in Chief-faced!

Now that classes have begun and you're in round-the-clock procrastination mode, Flyby presents a quick roundup of all the interesting things on the Internet that you missed while scrolling through Facebook.
 
1) Intro to Congress 1310, Still in Session
With talk of the Intro to Congress cheating scandal still fanning media flames months after its investigation, this case is taking longer to resolve than the time it takes Congress to agree on a Bill. Everyone, it seems, is taking this opportunity to weigh in on Harvard's practices, including late night talk show host Jon Stewart. Stewart voiced his disbelief that the test was administered "open-Internet" and scathingly asked, "Is this Harvard or the University of Phoenix?"
2) Pope or Nope?
Ah, the wonders of the Internet, giving anybody with a WiFi signal the ability to cast upon the world their every whim and complaint. The White House has a whole website devoted to just this: virtual petitions that people can "sign," enabling them to hop on board various causes without ever leaving their laptops. In the wake of Pope Benedict XVI's resignation, Yalies nominated the Yale University Vice President Linda Koch Korimer for the papal position. So, what does the Internet think: New Haven or the Vatican, pope are nope? We're thinking nope—the petition managed to gain 30 signatures (with 99,970 to go) before it was shut down. Nice try, guys.
 
3) Harvard Shake
As freshmen squirm and worry over the impending formation of blocking groups, Houses gear up to welcome them to their hallowed halls. In preparation, Pfoho staged its own vibrating version of the Harlem Shake. Yale, too, released a Harlem Shake—Nemo Edition, although whether the students are dancing or violently shivering in the snow is anyone's guess.
