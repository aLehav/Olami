After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To say “Ninja Assassin” is “so bad it’s funny” is to misunderstand the extent to which this violent and confused baboon of a movie is “bad.” Though some might try to give this latest martial arts melodrama the benefit of the doubt and call it “ironic,” “Ninja Assassin” has few fleeting moments of conscious self-deprecation. Its only redeeming characteristic, its constant flow of gasp-inducing, gory fight scenes, is undermined and rendered largely impotent by the frailty of its plot and characters.
Indeed, there is an unmistakable contrast between the visuals and the narrative of “Ninja Assassins.”  The last time director James McTeigue teamed up with writers Andy and Larry Wachowski—in 2005 for the blockbuster “V for Vendetta”—he had an engaging plot for a foundation on which to construct a dazzling series of cityscapes, underground lairs, and fight scenes.  This time around, however, the Wachowski brothers produce the film and leave the writing to rookie Matthew Sand and J. Michael Straczynski, who wrote the script for last year’s decidedly middling Clint Eastwood offering, “Changeling.” While McTeigue successfully creates a fantastical set of fight scenes, spouting and squelching in their admittedly gratuitous gore, Sand and Straczynski doom the movie to failure with a storyline so one-dimensional that one wishes it were comical.
The movie opens with an elderly tattoo artist imprinting the image of a dragon onto a mob boss. As he hacks away at the mobster’s skin in vivid onscreen detail, a telegram arrives filled with black dust.  The old man recoils in horror, explaining that the last time he saw such a letter, the mocking laughter of his employers was “drowned in blood.” Suddenly, a series of goons are inexplicably beheaded, halved, and cut limb by limb in rapid succession. No sword or swordsman is visible, only swoosh sounds and silver flickers. Blood spatters the walls, ceiling, floors, and the camera itself as the old man murmurs, “He is a demon, straight from hell.” In a stupefying 60 seconds, every character is dead save a lone ninja, who ends the scene by killing the prophetical senior citizen.
The movie then begins switching between two subplots: that of maverick Europol agent Mika (Naomie Harris) and that of ninja prodigy and outcast Raizo (played by Korean pop superstar Rain). While Mika disobeys her boss Maslow (Ben Miles) and follows a money trail leading toward a mythical set of Eastern ninja assassin clans, Raizo struggles through a series of flashbacks about his orphan past. As a child, he had been taken in by the centuries-old Ozunu clan and trained to become a ninja; after witnessing the clan murder his love interest, Raizo broke down, killed scores of his former brethren, and escaped—and he has been on the lam ever since.
The Ozunu clan discovers Mika’s research and only a sudden appearance of Raizo saves her from certain death-by-ninja.  The two plots then merge and the rest of the film is little more than a dramatic chase scene between Raizo and Mika, dozens of ninjas, and hundreds of Europol officers.
To be fair, this elongated chase is punctuated by a series of fight scenes as mesmerizing as the movie’s opening. While these scenes are some compensation for the rest of the film, they too lack suspense and intrigue. The interactions between Raizo and his beloved at the start of the film are so laughably flat that his attempts at revenging her death fail to inspire even a shred of empathy. Mika’s motivations for tracking down the Ozunu are even less clear. Thus, each fight is reduced to a lovely but meaningless dance that is devoid of contextual excitement.
“Ninja Assassin” is not entirely unpleasant. One cannot help but laugh at the film’s ridiculous premise—the struggles between omnipotent modern-day ninjas and rogue European police officers—and marvel at its terrifying violence. It is a movie whose narrative faults are very easy to mistake for lovable farce or parody. “Ninja Assassin,” however, is no joke: it’s an honest failure.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Director John Hillcoat and actor Viggo Mortensen have both made their names with dark, gritty films: Hillcoat with Nick Cave-scripted Western “The Proposition,” Mortensen with a pair of David Cronenberg thrillers, “A History of Violence” and “Eastern Promises.” It is tempting, then, to suggest that with “The Road,” a bleak, post-apocalyptic travelogue, both men are sticking to what they know.
Such a generalization, however, would be misleading. Though “The Road”—adapted from the Pulitzer-Prize winning novel by Cormac McCarthy—fits comfortably into a dark and atmospheric genre of post-disaster film that has recently included such uninspired schlock as “I Am Legend,” it is also quite unlike the films that have preceded it, including Mortensen and Hillcoat’s previous efforts. Eschewing narrative conventions, at least to the extent that big-budget Oscar bait can afford to do so, “The Road” maintains enough of the book’s central story to keep its audience enthralled while splitting its real attentions equally between creating a stunning visual spectacle and meditating on the book’s broader themes of love, redemption, and the human capacity for self-destruction.
“The Road” is the story of a nameless father (Mortensen) and son (Kodi Smit-McPhee) traveling across the devastated remains of an American continent that has experienced a disaster—of unknown origin—that wiped out the vast majority of the population. Endlessly searching for food and hunted by bands of cannibals, the two make their way toward the coast, where the father believes they may find safety and other “good” people.
Visually, Hillcoat and cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe play an established post-apocalyptic trick and drain the color from the once-lush forests and mountains that play host to the first half of the story. Only two things interrupt the film’s monochromatic palette: blood and fire, both of which are shot in horribly sharp relief. But Hillcoat and Aguirresarobe refuse to let their limited color range get in the way of shooting a strikingly desolate film, filled with a series of images that seem destined to become iconic. Father and son stumble down a warped concrete road, shattered telephone poles leaning ominously over them; Mortensen pushes a shopping cart through a marsh, silhouetted by guttering flames. On this “Road,” destruction and barrenness take on a peculiar sublimity.
Though the film’s bleak beauty may distract momentarily, it doesn’t take long to realize that it doesn’t seem to be going anywhere. But Hillcoat has created a road narrative without the ever-present forward motion that usually defines it. Instead, “The Road” is composed of fleeting moments, vignettes that slowly coalesce into a fuller picture of the characters and their experiences. Father and son run from bandits, enjoy an unopened, still-carbonated Coca-Cola, and eat canned fruit with an elderly fellow traveler, all the while theoretically moving toward the coast. The structure of the film doesn’t so much negate that motion as render it irrelevant.
The fragmentation of the film is furthered by its one major deviation from McCarthy’s book: the inclusion of a number of flashbacks. Featuring Charlize Theron as Mortensen’s wife—a character who appeared only referentially in the book—these scenes show the gradual unraveling of their family as the mysterious crisis unfolds outside shuttered windows.
The purpose of this addition is ambiguous, but any intended benefit is undermined by a horribly overplayed performance from Theron. Her tearfully dramatic interpretation of domestic strife, which might work well in another context, falls flat when juxtaposed with the quieter but far more affecting despair that permeates the rest of the film. Mortensen nearly resorts to similar overacting in the flashbacks, but he redeems himself in the main narrative with a perfect balance of subdued hopelessness and occasional sparks of faith. Rarely raising his voice above a low mumble, the father is still as vibrant a character as Mortensen has ever played. Smit-McPhee also impresses, with wide-eyed innocence tempered by ever-present sadness.
Several of the film’s vignettes stand out. Anyone who has seen Michael Haneke’s 2005 French-language drama “Hidden” recalls a certain scene: after 45 minutes of seemingly plotless meandering, a single moment of suicidal violence shocks the audience out of their fugue and puts them on the edge of their seats for the remainder of the film. “The Road” employs a similar effect; following a span of wandering, father and son come upon a disconcertingly civilized-looking house, which they are drawn to investigate. Readers of the book know exactly what's coming, which only makes it worse. Another memorable scene features Michael K. Williams, best known as Omar from “The Wire.” With all of five minutes of screen time, Williams blows the rest of the cast away as a pathetic thief who makes off with father and son’s belongings and pays a devastating price.
Those two scenes sparkle on their own, but together the vignettes create an effective conduit for the film’s major themes. Though the cause of civilization’s end remains unknown, there is some implication that it is manmade. Be it nuclear or environmental, “The Road” forces us to contemplate our end, brought about by our own hands. And it demands, ever so subtly, that we reassess our priorities and protect our planet from ourselves.
The fractured vision of “The Road” succeeds in that the audience’s attention is directed away from the road narrative and towards the big ideas that constitute the film’s core. But viewers who haven’t read the source material may be left somewhat bewildered by the vaguely serialized, disjointed final product. McCarthy’s book, as spare and angular as it was, remained a cohesive, plot-driven whole. Hillcoat’s film seeks to distill the novel’s essence, and in the process loses some of the details that would keep an uninitiated audience engaged. (Given how well the film works as it is, this is not so much a criticism as it is an exhortation to read the book before viewing it.)
“The Road” is a flawed film but a great one, brutally affecting and finally, unexpectedly, uplifting. It crystallizes our greatest fears about our own capabilities into a truly original and discomfiting vision of the world, and it very nearly does McCarthy’s book justice. Viewers may leave the theater not entirely sure what they just witnessed, but “The Road” will stick with them, as will the pressing questions it poses.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s massive library system is a university treasure. Preserving the quality and size of this rich academic asset is a worthy goal, and even in the midst of a recession, when cuts must be made and services must be discarded, the library system should be one of the last to feel the pinch. Hopefully, this principle will guide the university’s plan to revamp the library system to make it more centralized, digitized, and cost-effective, allowing Harvard’s collections to emerge from budget cuts more or less intact.
The plan to reform the Harvard College Library system, which was recently detailed in the university’s Library Task Force Report, aims to reduce the costs of maintaining the vast but fragmented Harvard College Library system by uniting the university’s 73 libraries under a central administrative body, transitioning to digital books in lieu of physical copies, and participating in book-lending programs with other schools.
Unifying the disparate elements of the library system makes sense, although it is not without its drawbacks. Student concerns that this will lead to the closing of departmental libraries are not unreasonable, but they are outweighed by the fact that centralization of libraries has the potential to make a convoluted system more navigable and accessible for everyone.
Similarly, the digitization of books will produce myriad benefits by making books more easily accessible and less expensive to acquire and maintain. However, this is also not without unfortunate consequences—many attach an important sentimental value to hard copies of books that cannot be replicated in equally massive, but electronic, collections. But we already possess large stores of physical texts that will not be abolished by library reforms; the “profound stimulus to the imagination” of walking through the Widener stacks described by English Professor Robert Scanlan will not be a victim of reforms. However, the concerns of students whose work relies on having physical copies should be taken very seriously so as not to hamper important niche fields of study.
Unification and digitization have their problems but are on the whole positive changes that are not at odds with maintaining the excellence of the university’s offerings. However, engaging in book-lending programs with other schools appears to be a less elegant solution to budgetary issues. The book-sharing system would diminish the immediate accessibility of texts and undermine the growth of a valuable academic resource. We should focus instead on acquiring texts so that they are accessible to students on demand, rather than participating in lending programs that open up competition for books to a wider audience and make the process of gaining access a book difficult.  Rather than curtailing the Harvard College Library’s growth by shifting toward lending rather than acquisition, the university should continue to focus on reforms like centralization and digitization, which are in line with the goal of maintaining an academic treasure while also making it efficient.

Every Thanksgiving, or at least for two years running, it has been the practice of the New York Times editorial page to print an appropriately grateful editorial. “Hard-hitting” would not, perhaps, be the most accurate descriptor for these pieces: Last year’s, for instance, emphasized the necessity for solidarity in tough times. This year’s waxed no less optimistic. “It will never cease to surprise how the condition of being human means we cannot foretell with any accuracy what next Thanksgiving will bring,” it declaimed. “Most of what life contains comes to us unexpectedly after all. It is our job to welcome it and give it meaning.”
On the morning of the 26th, that Panglossian prose initially confronted this writer as merely irritating. All joyful anticipation of the evening’s potatoes-and-pie promised land had just buckled under the triple knockout blows of a flat tire, a Weather Channel-defying drizzle, and a carnivorous version of Microsoft Office (one that apparently thrives on devouring junior papers-in-progress without a trace). No curmudgeon by nature, I couldn’t help but note that the “unexpected” seemed to get its kicks in somewhat perverse ways. In the end, however, holiday cheer prevailed, prompting a reluctant revaluation: Surely there must be some recent, unanticipated events that merit thanks?
As it so happens, the news was full of them. To start with, the watercooler gossip of the week: the couple who crashed a White House dinner party, posing for photos with political bigwigs like Obama and Biden and posting them to their Facebook. Turns out these were no high-society fundraisers but—surprise!—just a flashily dressed, celebrity-obsessed couple from Virginia, who also happened to be auditioning for “The Real Housewives of D.C.” The subsequent Secret Service foot-shuffling occasioned much media meditation on the shortfalls of government security. More thankfully, the story finally traced in bold the parallels between the equally absurd worlds of reality television and politics. Pursuing those connections wouldn’t be such a bad thing, maybe: Michelle always did seem like she could give Tyra a run for her fashion.
If this seems trivial, there’s no doubt that we should be grateful for the unpredicted survival of Nabokov’s incomplete final novel “The Original of Laura,” finally published a few weeks ago. Despite Nabokov’s request that it be posthumously burnt, his family suddenly concluded a tortured 30-year debate this fall by deciding to grant the public access to the fragments. Reviewers rightly note that the book falls far short of being a “Pale Fire” or “Lolita”—but we’re still lucky to have recourse to those passages which, in all their flawed beauty, throw light on his best.
In “Pnin,” Nabokov once wrote that “the order of the solar spectrum is not a closed circle but a spiral of tints from cadmium red and oranges through a strontian yellow and a pale paradisal green to cobalt blues and violets.” He would have been delighted by the chance findings of an Oregon State grad student this week, who in the process of experimenting with manganese oxide in a 2,000-degree furnace accidentally created a never-before-seen pigment of blue. Reportedly “shocked” at first, the professor in charge of the lab has confirmed that the crystal structure of the brilliant new color is stable, generating much excitement among chemists.
It would be easy to continue in this way, pulling at random from the grab bag of unpredictable news stories with happy endings. An attempt to Wikipedia “uncertainty principle” yields far too many Greek symbols for any still carbohydrate-glutted comprehension (although the page does include a pretty funny Heisenberg joke). I’m confident, though, that the Times is right—that it’s just these spontaneous, surprising events for which we should be most appreciative. Chance can admittedly pack a painful punch: Didn’t all those foreclosed mortgages take us unawares too? Yet the hopeful thought that, even in the worst of times, tomorrow things might look up fundamentally relies on the notions of uncertainty and the pleasantly unexpected. We can at least be sure of that.

Last Monday, the generally sage New York Times columnist David Brooks drew a somber line in the sand for health-care reform: “We all have to decide what we want at this moment in history, vitality or security. We can debate this or that provision, but where we come down will depend on that moral preference.” In the eyes of Brooks and a great many others, reform may very well create a more decent society—but only at the expense of economic dynamism and our oh-so-youthful American spirit.
For many, America now faces a brutal trade-off. We can favor the unregulated market, which “directs capital to the productive and the young,” or we can fancy welfare policies, which “direct resources to the vulnerable and the elderly.” We must choose whether to “siphon” resources from the vigorous, youthful, and innovative to the weak, aging, and ordinary.
But this supposed brutal choice is a phantom.
David Brooks is not the first to lay out forks in the road during the health-care debate. Other false dichotomies have been: Growth vs. equity, risk vs. safety, innovation vs. stagnation. Yet these kinds of approaches are not only invalid but are also incredibly, well, unhealthful.
If you believe the health-care system is presently in less-than-robust condition, the argument that we’ll become less dynamic with change makes little sense. If you take a moment to reflect on the last few years, Brooks’s premise that the unregulated market normally directs capital to the fresh, flourishing, and socially productive doesn’t seem entirely truthful. Indeed, we’ve seen throughout the economic crisis that unregulated capital is often prone to fall to the aged, entrenched, and socially disconnected.
In the case of the health-care debate, the equivalence of dynamism with unregulated markets falls even flatter. It is not merely the old, poor, and vulnerable who lack access to quality insurance and care today. Those who suffer from the high costs and limited scope of the system are seemingly some of the most “vital” groups in the country: working-class families and young, self-employed entrepreneurs. Those who are un-wealthy are at high risk to be unhealthy, but those who merely work hard outside government and corporate safety nets also need a powerful dose of reform. It’s difficult to say we’re doing well by pioneers when the average citizen worries about starting her own business because of medical bills. It’s tough to say we’re economically flexible when the average American family worries about bankruptcy when a child falls sick.
Assuredly, one might respond that what anti-reformers worry about is future vitality: If our spirit of self-reliance does not wither with further government coddling, our debt from reform will destroy the can-do spirit of our posterity. And yet, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the bill passed by the House would reduce the deficit by $109 billion over the first decade, and the Senate bill would reduce it by $127 billion—not to mention the other, more difficult to quantify elements such as the excise tax on high-cost insurance that will bring down costs as we grow. On the flipside, if we keep the current system, our general fiscal health will decay along with the initiative of many might-have-been trailblazers. The CBO has also estimated that by 2016 premiums will be $15,000 for a family of four in the Exchange, well below the $24,000 family premium expected if Congress fails to act.
The argument that American vitality will diminish if we pass the health-insurance bill is ultimately not only misleading, but also dangerous. When we wedge complicated issues between incompatible moral principles, we often drift further from pragmatic reform. There is no doubt that the health-care debate is just as much about values as dollars, but reducing the values debate to a pleasant, soothing dichotomy only solidifies the status quo. Claiming we can’t currently circumvent a tragic choice only postpones the change we need.
Although forecasting the economic climate is difficult, we know that, in the past, security and vitality have tended to be more complementary than conflicting. In the greatest episodes of our American journey, vitality and security have gone hand in hand. Making it easier to take care of the basics of life strengthens the middle class and spurs future growth.
Perhaps worst of all, the “vitality vs. security” argument masks a certain, purposeful interdependence in America, especially between generations. Democracy works on the premise that the social contract spans eras. Today’s young provide some protection for those who sacrificed in the past, and today’s elderly maintain a duty of active stewardship for those who will come in the future. There are live wires between us, and to describe the American contract of caring for citizens of other generations as a mere siphoning process, as Brooks does, is to cheapen it.
We’re certainly at a historical fork in the road, but we need not choose between vitality and security. In the eyes of this young writer, America will be dynamic so long as we hope for a better tomorrow. We will be vibrant so long as we provide pathways to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for as many as possible and not just for a few. We will be youthful so long as we keep the dream alive. And we will be all the more vital if we pass reform.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I recently picked up a very disturbing book. No, it wasn’t Sarah’s Palin’s “Going Rogue.” It was Charles Darwin’s “The Origin of Species.”
A couple weeks ago, swarms of evangelicals and creationists descended on college campuses around the country, including Harvard, to distribute their unauthorized version of “The Origin,” complete with an insidious introduction by Ray Comfort, the creationist author.
Like Palin’s book tour, Comfort’s stunt had more to do with generating media attention and feelings of self-righteous victimhood than anything else. Both Comfort and Palin tap into middle-American rage at perceived elitists, particularly those in the media. Both care more about consolidating an angry base than bringing others over to their side. The only thing we might say on Comfort’s behalf is that at least he has the guts to try to spread his message where it’s bound to be unpopular, even if only as a way of stirring up controversy. Imagine if Palin’s tour had included the Harvard Book Store!
But, in fact, it’s apparent that Comfort did not intend for his student readers to even reach Darwin’s actual text. He had claimed that his edition of “The Origin” would include every word of the original, but the first printing left out four whole chapters. And the second edition, while complete, has such small font that it’s readable only if your eyes are irreducibly complex. Needless to say, though, Comfort’s introduction has always been printed in children’s-book lettering.
And the words that those letters form are something else entirely. There’s warmed-over intelligent design nonsense; outrageous insults, e.g., Darwin was a racist, a sexist, and a proto-Nazi; and totally ridiculous claims about evolution, like that it requires the discovery of a “crocoduck.”
Comfort’s crusade is threatening not because there’s any chance that his silly introduction will win new converts, but because his PR strategy couches his mission in educational, even humanistic terms. Like most recent creationist activists, he paints a picture of intolerant school administrators, of scientists who take evolution on “faith,” of atheists too cowardly to debate in public. He cries censorship when anonymous online commenters declare that they’d like to burn his book. He portrays himself as an open-minded intellectual who gives both sides their due and who comes out, after much rational consideration, against the very existence of evolution.
This is scary stuff. It appeals to Americans’ innate open-mindedness and ultimately to their over-the-top postmodernism: Nobody really knows the truth one way or the other, so let’s put evolution and creationism side by side and let the children decide. Comfort and his kind are trying to embarrass secular liberalism on its own terms.
By all measures, this strategy is working. A substantial majority of Americans supports teaching creationism along with evolution in public schools. Many Americans are so confused about the interaction between science and faith that two different majorities, in the same poll, report believing that humans evolved over millions of years and that God created us in our present form 10,000 years ago. But maybe that’s not fair. After all, when Gallup gave people the opportunity to say, essentially, “I have no freaking clue what you’re asking me about, and I wish you would leave me alone,” a solid 36 percent chose that option. The problem isn’t inconsistency, it’s ignorance—and Comfort is feeding it.
Until we persuade a sizable majority of Americans to believe in evolution and establish the legitimacy of teaching science in science classrooms, it seems pointless to wrestle with bigger theoretical and theological questions. Some ask whether we can reconcile science and religion. I have a better question: Can we have a productive debate about such issues before we first share some common ground on the legitimacy of science? The problem with the so-called New Atheists is not that they’re wrong (I’ll leave that question open), but that they put the cart in front of the horse. You can’t hope to convince people that evolution undermines religion if they don’t already believe in evolution.
So I welcome Richard Dawkins’s new entry in the growing “evolution for dummies” literature; maybe he should have come out with “The Greatest Show on Earth” before “The God Delusion.” Because unless he gets everyone to see that, contra Comfort, the banana’s “no-slip grip” does not provide evidence for God, he’ll never get to the bigger Jesus-fish he has to fry.

After ten years serving as masters of Eliot House, Lino Pertile and Anna Bensted announced that they plan to step down from their posts in June 2010 in an e-mail to the House community on Thanksgiving Day.
“This has been, and continues to be, a wonderful experience that I have enjoyed enormously in all aspects and particularly in my constant contact with the undergraduates that I got to know throughout the years,” Pertile said in an interview.
He said that he and Bensted are stepping down because they decided prior to assuming their posts that they would only remain there for ten years.
In their e-mail, Pertile and Bensted thanked undergraduates for the experience of living with them for the past decade, referencing specific community activities that residents said helped build House spirit.
“Lino’s enthusiasm for the IM crew races and the Eliot Boat Club has infused so much life into that aspect of House culture, which has spilled over into so many other places,” wrote House Committee Co-Chair Michael F. Ayoub ’10 in an e-mailed statement to the Crimson. “The open houses they periodically hold at their residence are always warm and inviting, a main social event for all of Eliot House.”
Pertile and Bensted also frequently chat with House residents in the dining hall and make an effort to learn the names of every new House resident before he or she moves in, Ayoub wrote.
Toby Berkman, a resident tutor in Eliot House, said that Pertile and Bensted have worked to create an open and comfortable community for its members.
“Lino believes in interpersonal communication,” he said. “While we send out announcements over e-mail, he has an Eliot ‘Town Crier’ stand up in the dining hall and declare events over dinner. This brings us back to a time when people communicated face-to-face.”
Members of the House community said that Pertile is renowned for his narrative abilities, and the Masters capitalized upon this in their letter to the House. In the missive, Pertile tells the tale of a deal he made with the ghost of former University President and House namesake Charles W. Eliot: that new House Masters cannot come unless Eliot House wins the Agassiz Cup for House crew. (Pertile told House members that the former Harvard president agreed to help boost the team to victory this year.)
Pertile—who grew up in a small village between Padua and Venice in Northeastern Italy—is also a professor of Romance Languages and Literatures and has published widely within the field of Dante scholarship.
He is currently teaching Literature and Arts A-26: “Dante’s Divine Comedy and its World.” Last fall, he received a Q guide rating of 4.5 as an instructor, while the course received a 4.4 overall.
Prior to beginning his Harvard career, Pertile taught in the United Kingdom at the Universities of Reading, Sussex, and Edinburgh.
Bensted is assistant program director and executive producer of special projects at WBUR, the National Public Radio station in Boston. She worked for over a decade in the UK prior to starting work at WBUR.

University President Drew G. Faust announced a collaborative effort with a South African university to improve the country’s education systems last Thursday during a six-day trip there, the secon time a sitting University president has travelled to the African continent.
The effort, a partnership between the University of Johannesburg and the Harvard Graduate School of Education, “is designed to raise the professional standards for South African school leaders, national and provincial education officials, and other education stakeholders,” according to Ellen M. Sullivan, Harvard’s director of international advancement.
The three-year initiative will culminate in the creation of the Education Leadership Institute, to be housed at UJ’s Soweto campus. The program will also create a network for primary and secondary school administrators and a leadership development program for school and district administrators, Sullivan wrote in an e-mail.
Faust’s speech said that the program can be seen as part of a more general response to endemic underdevelopment and high crime levels in South Africa, despite its triumph over apartheid almost twenty years ago.
“If we look at South Africa and any developing nation, education is enormously important,” said Professor Caroline M. Elkins, a renowned Africanist.
“There is a great deal of improvement that needs to be done in the education system there,” said Amy Y. Wang ’12, who spent last summer teaching high school students in South Africa. “Improving the quality of teachers is perhaps one of the biggest things that needs to be done.”
But last week’s announcement, in the midst of a six-day trip to Africa, carried a deeper symbolic message not lost on students and administrators here in Cambridge.
Elkins said President Faust’s trip to the African continent represented a nod to the region’s significance, demonstrated a renewed commitment to Africa and its issues, and provided a large measure of hope for the people of Africa.
“I couldn’t emphasize enough the significance of President Faust being in Africa and the statement that makes for the community here at Harvard but also to Africans themselves,” Elkins said.
Speaking in Soweto—a city symbolic of the struggle against apartheid after protesting schoolchildren were brutally gunned down there in 1976—President Faust emphasized the importance of education in civil rights struggles and compared the South African struggle to the American civil rights movement.
“In those stories lies a common struggle for liberation, for universal rights before the law, and for human dignity against the evils of slavery and apartheid,” she said in her speech. “So if the journey from Boston to Johannesburg is a long one in miles, it is for countless Americans a very short one in emotional resonance. I am one of those Americans.”
Although many regions of Africa could benefit from the establishment of a similar program, Elkins said that Harvard chose to set up the program in South Africa because of the University’s decades-long relationship with that nation and because Harvard administrators hope that the program might serve as a model for the region.
During her tenure, Faust has made a point of emphasizing the University’s international character, travelling to China last year for a Harvard Alumni Association conference.

CORRECTION: MAR. 29, 2011
The Nov. 11, 2010 article "Faust Embraces African Eduation" incorrectly stated that University President Drew G. Faust was the first Harvard president to visit the African continent. In fact, former University President Derek C. Bok first visited Africa on a trip in 1975.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Smiling faces, a steaming meal, and containers of Play-Doh greeted students who remained on campus over the Thanksgiving holiday at a celebration of the season in Eliot Dining Hall last Thursday evening.
Eliot House Resident Tutor Carl L. Miller said he had initially planned to welcome his parents and relatives to Harvard with a home-cooked meal, but then decided to open the event to any and all comers after he and his wife, fellow Eliot tutor Valencia Miller, “thought back to [their] undergraduate experiences and the times [they] could not go home.”
During those on-campus holidays, Miller said, it “felt good...to be with a quasi-family.”
After eating a delicious meal of turkey, stuffing, and macaroni and cheese, each person in attendance shared a Play-Doh creation—a model of the thing for which they were most thankful—in a large-scale rendition of a Miller family tradition.
A miniature blue elephant with well-defined tusks—sculpted to look like the Eliot House mascot—and a harlequin spider with a yellow body and red legs that terminated in blue shoes were among the favorites.
Students in attendance attested that the Eliot House event—aided by Grandma Miller’s secret recipe for sweet potato pie—provided a satisfactory alternative to celebrating the holiday at home.
“We had a great time,” Miller said after the festivities ended. “I’m just glad that the students enjoyed it.”
In another corner of the campus, Arturo Cuevas ’12 of Leverett House observed Thanksgiving in a different way.
“Thanksgiving Day, I cleaned my room which I haven’t done in a long time,” Cuevas reluctantly admitted.
Aside from isolating himself in his dorm to clean, Cuevas was also able to find a locale where he could partake of some Thanksgiving victuals. For members of RAZA—Harvard’s Mexican-American student organization—a local Harvard and RAZA alum provided a veritable cornucopia of foods at his apartment.
“He invited a lot of us to cook with him,” Cuevas explained. “The dinner we had was pretty good actually.”
Cuevas summed up his opinion of the Thanksgiving experience at Harvard by saying that it was “a good way for people to relax.”
For students who were not affiliated with any organized functions or clubs that met during the recess, a Thanksgiving meal was offered for six straight hours at Dunster House, beginning at noon. Centerpieces included cider-glazed ham, roast turkey breast, and after-dinner mints.
“If you’re staying here,” Cuevas said, “you might want to try to make the most of it.”

History professor Niall C. Ferguson took home the International Emmy Award for “Best Documentary” last week for his six-part series, “The Ascent of Money,” which chronicles the history of money, credit, and banking from Babylon to the current financial crisis.
The documentary—which was reduced to four parts and aired on PBS in July 2009—shares the title of Ferguson’s tenth book and is based on his course “History 1961: International Financial History, 1700 to Present,” which was last taught at the College in the fall of 2007.
“[The film] really grew out of the class History 1961 and was a great way of setting up the argument,” said Ferguson, who holds a joint appointment at the Business School, in an interview on Saturday. “That really helped me to write [it]”.
The course is scheduled to be offered in the 2010-2011 school year under a new course catalog number.
Public-service broadcast Channel 4 in the UK first aired the production in 2008, while PBS aired a shorter U.S. version in January and July 2009, in time for the bank collapses and bailouts of the global financial crisis.
“While that was happening, the economy was collapsing, so it became timely,” said the documentary’s Executive-in-Charge Stephen Segaller, who produced the film for WNET.org. “We wanted to get it out as quickly as possible.”
The film was directed by the award-winning documentarian Adrian Pennink, who also directed Ferguson’s previous film, which was based on his book “Empire: The Rise and the Demise of the British World Order and the Lessons for Global Power.”
But according to Pennink, “The Ascent of Money,” posed a unique challenge for him as a director—describing money and markets with images.
“Its not like making history of the British empire,” Pennink said. “This one was much harder to visualize [...] and make it interesting to watch.” He called making “a challenging and intellectually robust TV series also popular” the most challenging aspect of the project.
Ferguson said that he believes the film accomplishes his goal of reaching a large audience, despite the lack of financial knowledge currently available to laymen.
“Ignorance of financial history is one of the things that caused this crisis—this apparent belief that all the financial problems of the past cannot occur again,” Ferguson said. “It is not an elite subject, it is a common subject.”
The film presents a timely warning against the danger of the United States’ continued dependence on China for credit, particularly in light of the ongoing financial crisis.
“It is not quite the happy marriage it used to be. One part does all the saving and one does all the spending,” Ferguson said.
Pennink and Ferguson are currently in the process of creating a TV series based on another course taught by Ferguson, “History 2921: The Western Ascendency.”
Both hope that PBS will decide to sign on to the project, which is planned to be completed at the end of 2010 and broadcast in 2011.

Cabot House Masters Jay M. Harris and Cheryl L. Harris announced last night that they will resign their posts at the end of the current academic year, citing heavy responsibilities in other areas of their work.
Jay Harris had not indicated his plan to step down from the position he and his wife have held for seven years before sending out last night’s notification over the Cabot Announce e-mail list, according to Cabot resident tutor Zirui Song.
“While we very much wanted to stay on through ten years as Masters, we feel that with Jay’s new responsibilities in University Hall and the escalating demands of Cheryl’s job we are unable to put in the time or do the job the way we think it ought to be done,” the e-mail stated. “Cabot deserves better than we feel we can give it at this time, and so we think it is best that we step aside and allow the College to bring in some new blood.”
In the summer of 2008, Harris was named dean of undergraduate education by Dean of the College Evelyn M. Hammonds. He continues to serve as the Wolfson Professor of Jewish Studies.
Harris also helped pave the way for this fall’s launch of the new General Education curriculum, heading the General Education Standing Committee since 2007, which has approved over 150 courses for the program. This fall, Harris became the faculty director of the Office of General Education, which is in the process of absorbing the Core Program.
He is teaching one course this fall, Moral Reasoning 54: “If There is No God, All is Permitted.”
Cheryl L. Harris is a school psychologist at Sharon High School in Sharon, Mass.
The resignation e-mail mentioned the persistent challenge of not being able to define the jobs of House masters.
“We would not know how to describe it to our successors,” they wrote in the letter, “other than to advise them to hang on for the ride of their lives.”
The Harrises also praised Cabot’s new Allston-Burr Resident Dean, Jill Constantino, who replaced Mya M. Mangawang after Mangawang resigned last May.
Students and tutors said they were surprised and saddened at Harris’s announcement and said that the Harrises had been excellent House Masters—several students mentioned that Jay Harris knows every Cabot resident’s name.
“Jay’s always been very supportive of the students,” said Cabot HoCo co-chair Karl J. Kmiecik ’10.
Song, a second year tutor, said that Harris respects tutors’ autonomy and supports them both in their duties as tutors and in their own academic pursuits.
“We [tutors] really work with him, as opposed to for him,” Song said.
Students said that they had seen no change in the amount of time Harris spent fulfilling his duties as House Master over the past year. “I still see him in the dining hall a lot having brunch with students,” Luci Yang ’11 said.
Other students said that they could understand why Harris might want to resign.
“I can see how this must be a really stressful time for someone in a position like his,” said Cabot resident Benjamin T. Hand ’12, who serves on the Gen Ed Committee with Harris.
Harris’s e-mail came three days after Eliot House Masters Lino Pertile and Anna Bernsted informed residents of their House that they would leave their posts at the end of the academic year after having completed a 10-year stint as Masters.
Hammonds is responsible for filling House Master vacancies. She has already installed new masters in Winthrop and Pforzheimer Houses during her tenure, which began in June 2008.

Though Black Friday in Harvard Square lacked the typical 5 a.m. rush of shoppers searching for dramatically slashed price tags, dispersed sales for smaller items did draw some bargain hunters to local storefronts.
Harvard Square’s stores stuck to their normal opening times, but store owners said that more shoppers than usual flocked to search for deals.
“We saw people buying a lot of smaller items, like stocking stuffers,” said Julie J. Lee, a sales associate at Passport Boutique, which sold out of mittens by mid-afternoon.
Sales ranged from free mango lassis at Cafe of India to a 10 percent discount off all gift baskets at Cardullo’s.
“Black Friday itself doesn’t bring anything extra for us,” said Mark R. Faxex, a staffer at the Tannery, who added that Saturday was substantially busier than Friday.
Amanda Nazarian, a staffer at Harvard Book Store, also said that she saw fewer shoppers on Friday than on Saturday.
“Friday was not as busy as we were expecting it to be,” she added.
But the trends in Cambridge aren’t surprising in light of depressed spending figures all across the country. According to a National Retail Federation survey, per-person spending on Black Friday weekend dropped from $372.57 in 2008 to $343.31 in 2009.
But Americans are still making their way out to stores: 195 million people  turned out this past weekend compared to 172 million last year.
Some Massachusetts shoppers even fled to New Hampshire to avoid the sales tax, according to a Nov. 28 article in the Boston Globe.
But Black Friday in Harvard Square was more low-key.
“Shopping here is not as dramatic as in a mall when everyone rushes in as soon as the door opens,” said Michelle Corliss, a staffer at Curious George Goes to WordsWorth. “Considering the circumstances, I think we are doing pretty well.”
With the advent of online CyberMonday sales and more extended Black Friday weekend deals, the focus of stores nationwide is now shifting from a one-day shopping splurge to a more drawn-out holiday shopping season, according to a Nov. 25 New York Times article. Some stores around the country are looking to increase revenue with more sales through the coming weeks.
While shopping malls did attract some of Massachusetts’ more serious bargain hunters, Harvard Square still attracted a reasonably large audience—in spite of the cold, rainy weather.
“I was surprised that so many people came in,” said Lee, the Passport staffer.

An annual fellowship for business reporting will be added to the collection of 2010 Nieman Foundation fellowships, the group announced last week.
The Donald W. Reynolds Nieman Fellowship in Business Journalism was established with a grant from the Donald W. Reynolds Foundation, a national philanthropic organization that funds areas including journalism and cardiovascular research.
Nieman Fellows live in the Cambridge area, are allowed to audit undergraduate and graduate courses, and sometimes attend or participate in seminars and talks by professors and leading journalists. The business journalism fellowship will enable a journalist to connect with business leaders and study business, finance, and economics, according to the Nieman Foundation’s Web site.
“If you pay attention to the news today, there are so many stories that have an economic or business or finance angle to them, whether it is health care reform or bailouts or the stimulus package,” Nieman Foundation Curator Robert H. Giles said. “There are important economic elements to each of these stories.”
Many reporters do not have a strong understanding of economics, Giles said. “They sort of pick it up along the way, and this is a very complex subject,” he said.
The fellowship, which encourages fellows to study at the Kennedy School of Government, the Business School, and the Economics department, will “fill in their knowledge gap,” Giles said.
Like all other prospective Nieman Fellows, applicants to the Donald W. Reynolds Nieman Fellowship in Business Journalism must be full-time reporters or freelance writers who have had at least five years of experience in professional journalism. An applicant to the business reporting fellowship must also be a U.S. citizen and should be “a journalist of accomplishment, who has an upward career trajectory, [and] who has worked as a reporter in [business] for some time,” Giles said.
Applications to the fellowship are due on Jan. 31. Finalists will be invited to Cambridge for interviews in late April and early May, after which one fellow will be chosen.
The Reynolds grant—which totals $918,130—also reinstated the community journalism fellowship, established five years ago by the Reynolds Foundation to fund fellowships for reporters from small newspapers. It will be used to fund one community journalist and one business journalist per year for the next five years.

Harvard Law School announced Monday that it is likely to scale back a program launched in 2008 that waives third-year tuition for students planning to pursue careers in public service, as University-wide budget cuts force schools to re-examine financial aid allocations.
In an e-mail to Law School students, Law School Dean Martha Minow wrote that all current students can continue to participate in the Public Service Initiative and receive the full one-year tuition waiver if they commit to five years of public service after graduation. But it is unlikely that the program will be offered to future incoming classes, including students admitted this fall, Minow wrote.
This fall, 58 third-year students signed up for the initiative, which has a budget of $3 million per year for a five-year period ending in 2012.
Minow wrote that a Public Service Task Force has been appointed to determine how to promote public service after the Public Service Initiative comes to an end. A new initiative, to be extended to students admitted this fall and in the following years, is expected to be announced by next March.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
All season long, the Harvard men’s soccer team found ways to win games. Yesterday on Ohiri Field, it found ways to lose one.
Despite outplaying defending national champions Maryland for large portions of the 90 minutes, the 10th-seeded Crimson gave up a goal in each half—both against the run of play—and missed a penalty on its way to a third-round exit from the NCAA Tournament.
The 2-0 loss was a disappointing end to a season in which Harvard (14-4-1) exceeded expectations and won the Ivy League title.
“We don’t often get shut out in games,” Crimson coach Jamie Clark said. “[Maryland] played effectively, they played well, they put numbers where it mattered, and they were opportunistic.”
The Terrapins (15-5-2) came into the contest having won four of their last five games but were put on the back foot immediately.
With the wind behind them in the first half, the Harvard players looked to take advantage of the weather and pushed hard for an early goal.
Maryland keeper Zac MacMath was called to action in the third minute, easily bringing in co-captain Andre Akpan’s header.
Five minutes later, senior Desmond Mitchell nearly latched onto a cross from classmate Adam Rousmaniere, but the pass skidded inches in front of Mitchell’s outstretched leg.
An early goal came, but it was Maryland that grabbed the opener. On the Terrapins’ first attack of the match, Taylor Kemp squeezed past Mitchell and junior defender Robert Millock. Kemp found teammate Casey Townsend, who was sitting unmarked by the penalty spot after striker Jason Herrick made a run to the near post that drew the attention of the Crimson defenders. Townsend shot with his left foot, but the ball ricocheted off his right foot before getting caught in the wind and looping over sophomore keeper Austin Harms.
After the goal, Harvard continued to dominate the first half but struggled to create chances.
In the 34th minute, freshman Scott Prozeller sent a through ball in behind the Terrapins’ back line into the right side of the box. Akpan was able to get there before MacMath, who could do nothing but bring down the Crimson’s star striker.
Harvard, it seemed, had its lifeline.
Up stepped Akpan with a chance to break the Crimson’s all-time scoring record, and more importantly, pull Harvard level.
But while the Crimson had its best player taking the penalty, Maryland had its best player trying to stop it. MacMath, who led the nation in goals-against-average in 2008 as a freshman and has played for the U.S. National Team at various youth levels, was recently named First Team All-ACC.
Akpan stutter-stepped on his run-up to throw off MacMath but struck his penalty weakly to the right. The rebound came back to Akpan off MacMath’s knee, but the ball took a high bounce, and Akpan was unable to get his foot over it, sending his attempt high into the air, and eventually, into the arms of MacMath.
“We had done our research and had an idea of what [Akpan] likes to do,” Maryland coach Sasho Cirovski said. “[MacMath] just stood him up and made a good reaction for the save.”
“Maybe it wasn’t meant to be for me to break the record,” Akpan said.
The miss left Harvard with a mountain to climb in the second half. The Terrapins—now 12-0 this year in games in which they have scored first—had the wind at their backs as they tried to kill off the match.
The wind’s impact became clear when Maryland took the upper hand at the start of the second half. The Crimson was giving the ball away cheaply, but the Terrapins seemed wary of pushing too many men forward.
The first real chance of the second half came in the 69th minute, when Harms kept Harvard in the game, saving a close-range shot from Herrick.
All of a sudden the match kicked into life.
With 17 minutes left, junior Alex Chi’s work rate put Maryland under pressure, but MacMath beat the midfielder to the ball to maintain his shutout.
A minute later, Rousmaniere headed off the line to stop the Terrapins from doubling their lead.
Following the scare, the Crimson regained momentum and began to control possession.
Unfortunately for Harvard, another Maryland counterattack proved costly. With freshman defender Richard Smith up-field for a set piece, the Crimson was left shorthanded at the back in the 78th minute. The Terrapins moved the ball to the left, and, from about 30 yards out, midfielder Billy Cortes shifted the ball onto his right foot, before placing it into the bottom right corner of the net.
The sun may have been nice for the fans in attendance—nearly 2000 people showed up to watch the game—but its glare certainly didn’t help Harms.
The goal assured Maryland a spot in the Elite Eight and marked the end of the road for Harvard’s five seniors. Akpan, his co-captain Brian Grimm, Mitchell, First-Team All-Ivy defender Kwaku Nyamekye, and Rousmaniere combined to form almost half of the Crimson’s starting lineup, and together they represent perhaps the greatest class in the history of Harvard soccer. They finish their careers with two Ivy League titles and never missed an NCAA Tournament.
“We’ve taken the team to places that we haven’t been in a long, long time,” Nyamekye said.
“The hardest thing, with as talented a senior class as we had, is to have it end,” Clark said. “Only one team ends up happy, and it looks like it will be someone else this year.”

BOSTON—Once again, Jeremy Lin saved his best for last.
With five minutes left and his team trailing by four points, the co-captain guard singlehandedly outscored Boston University, 11-0, over the next three minutes of play, leading Harvard to its first road victory over the Terriers (2-5) since 1975.
The Crimson’s 78-70 win ended an eight-game losing streak for Harvard (5-1) against its cross-town opponent.
“It feels great to finally be able to get that win—not getting swept in your college career,” senior Pat Magnarelli said.
It was Magnarelli’s classmate, Lin, who prevented the sweep.
Held to just three points in the first half, the 6’3 guard exploded to a 16-point second frame on 4-of-6 shooting.
“He has great stamina,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “He can go longer, harder than most other people.”
After falling behind early in the second half, Harvard struggled to regain the lead down the stretch, trailing 64-60 with just over five minutes remaining.
Lin cut the lead to two after he was fouled turning the corner on his defender.
BU, which struggled from behind the arc throughout the contest—shooting 25 percent from long range—then misfired on a three-pointer.
Freshman Brandyn Curry dribbled up the court and found Lin on the left wing with just enough space to sink the three that gave Harvard its first lead since the opening minutes of the second half.
This time, the Crimson would not give up the advantage.
Junior swingman John Holland, who led the Terriers with 18 points, did his best to respond, driving to the basket for a lay-up—but not before he was whistled for an offensive foul.
Lin extended the lead to three points for Harvard, hitting two free throws after getting tripped up on his way to the basket.
On the following possession, Lin came away with a steal and darted back the other way, kissing the ball off the glass.
The Terriers marched back up the court, but this time, Curry came up with the steal.
The freshman threw it ahead to Lin, who separated from the crowd and finished with a thunderous one-handed dunk to cap the 11-0 run.
“[Lin’s] ability to stay strong down the stretch—that’s something he brings to the table,” Amaker said.
Clutch free throws from sophomore Oliver McNally in the game’s final minute sealed the deal for the Crimson.
Yet again, Harvard relied on the performance of its bench to outlast its opponents. While the Crimson received 27 points from its reserves, the BU bench contributed only two points.
“Our ability to play a number of players and have the depth really helped us,” Amaker said. “We trusted a lot of players out there.”
Nine players received double-digit minutes for Harvard, compared to just six for the Terriers, who have been plagued by injuries.
“They were definitely fresher,” BU coach Patrick Chambers said. “When we got under the four-minute [mark], we were gassed.”
But for the first 35 minutes, the Terrier starters were more than able to keep pace with the Crimson, dominating much of the game after falling behind early.
Still, Harvard’s persistence won out. Knotted with its hosts at 13 points apiece early on, the Crimson began pounding it inside, relying on the play of its forwards to lead its offense.
Magnarelli, sophomore Keith Wright, and freshman Kyle Casey led Harvard on 9-2 run that gave it a 22-17 lead.
Just minutes later, a five-point spurt from Wright and a three-pointer for Lin gave Harvard a 30-17 lead with 5:37 left in the first half.
But BU closed the gap heading into intermission, going on a 15-4 run to end the half down by only four.
“It was a game of runs,” Amaker said.
The Terriers picked up right where they left off following the break, earning their first lead of the game in the opening minutes off a three-pointer from guard Carlos Strong.
While Boston University held onto the lead for the majority of the second half, the Crimson finally clawed back.
“I thought our kids displayed a great deal of energy and hunger,” Amaker said. “I told our kids when we had the lead finally in the late stages of the game, ‘We have a chance to finish it.’”

On the eve of Thanksgiving, Harvard men’s basketball had much to be thankful for, as 12 players saw action in a 78-60 romp over UNH at Lavietes Pavilion.
Coming off a disappointing loss to Army on Monday, the Crimson looked to right the ship and justify the vote it received in this week’s AP Top 25 poll.
“It was an impressive response to our worst performance at Army,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I was really pleased to see how our kids were very focused, very determined against a team that is a lot better than what they displayed tonight.”
The game was never in doubt. Using its size advantage early, the Crimson got on the board with three straight post-ups from sophomore forward Keith Wright and senior co-captain Doug Miller.
“This is the best game I’ve seen [the big men] play all season,” co-captain guard Jeremy Lin said. “They came out from the tip, running all over the place and being physical.”
Next, Harvard looked to freshman guard Christian Webster, making his first collegiate start in place of sophomore guard Max Kenyi, who tore his MCL in Monday’s game.
The freshman knocked down a trey from the corner for three of his 15 points on the night.
“After that first shot in the corner I felt confident, and I went from there,” Webster said.
The Crimson connected on its first four shots en route to an early 11-2 lead while the Wildcats missed nine straight to start.
The rest of the half was marked by tenacious defense and efficient offense. Harvard held UNH to just 19 percent shooting in the opening period, and did not allow a two-point field goal in the entire frame.
“If we can do that every game, we’ll give ourselves a chance to win,” Lin said.
The offense was equally prolific. The Crimson scored a season-high 46 points in the first half due to 11 three-pointers and 60.9 percent shooting from the field. The spark plug for much of the night was sophomore guard Oliver McNally who tallied a career-high nine assists to go with zero turnovers on the game.
“[McNally’s] halftime stats would’ve been a great line for a game,” Amaker said. “I think the world of the kid...You can count on him—he’s a player that’s going to show up every night.”
With time running out in the opening period, Harvard was in the familiar position of trusting Lin with the ball. The senior cradled the ball for a few seconds, ran off a pick at the top of the key, and buried a three-pointer as time expired to give the Crimson a 46-26 lead. The buzzer beater was the Lin’s third in four games.
Lin finished the game as the leading scorer, with 18 points along with seven rebounds and two assists.
For Harvard, much of the second half was devoted to the freshmen. Webster and fellow freshmen Brandyn Curry, Dee Giger, Kyle Casey, Jeff Georgatos, and Peter Edelson all saw playing time and combined for a total of 38 points.
“I like what these kids have been able to do thus far,” Amaker said. “We thought they were going to be able to make strong contributions to our team. Some of them are above and beyond what we thought at this point, and we’re pleased with that.”
The win was a marked improvement over last Monday, when the Crimson was plagued by 30 turnovers and 61.3 percent shooting from the free-throw line.
Last night, Harvard only coughed the ball up 15 times and hit 22 of 24 from the charity stripe.
“A lot of things were much better. We talked to our kids about regrouping and responding,” Amaker said. “I was very pleased with how we were able to respond in a lot of ways.”

According to the Crimson, it’s not all about the destination. It’s about how you get there.
The Harvard women’s basketball team traveled to Boulder, Colo. for the Omni Hotels Classic, taking on New Orleans and Colorado University in the two-day tournament.
Despite thin air and a weary squad, the Crimson (3-3) dispatched the Privateers, 60-57, on Friday night before falling to the heavily-favored Buffaloes, 67-65, on Saturday.
Both contests remained close until the final buzzer, but junior co-captain Claire Wheeler suggested that the back-and-forth games were decided by sustained play, not last-minute heroics.
“Honestly, it’s not as much about the end,” Wheeler said of the loss to Colorado. “We made errors that we could have controlled, and that would not have put is in position to be that close at the end. Throughout the game, we just need to clean it up and become more consistent.”
Although Wheeler expressed frustration that Harvard let Saturday’s game slip away, the junior deemed the weekend a success, as the Crimson not only earned a split but also proved that it can keep pace with more heralded programs.
“At this point in the season, Colorado should be blowing people out, but we hung in there and could have beaten them,” Wheeler said. “Everything didn’t go our way…but we never gave up. The team really battled and everyone was there for each other.”
COLORADO 67, HARVARD 65
The Buffaloes (5-1) entered the tournament championship on a roll, but it was the Crimson that came out firing. The visiting squad jumped out to an 8-0 lead and kept its foot on the pedal thanks to a number of key performances. Junior Emma Markley posted a team-high 24 points, freshman Victoria Lippert added 14, and junior Jackie Alemany grabbed a career-high 11 rebounds.
Still, Harvard could not subdue the Buffaloes, who consistently overcame large deficits and netted the decisive basket with five seconds remaining.
“We had a great start to the first and second halves, and the goal is to sustain that energy,” Wheeler said. “One goal we did reach was that we outrebounded Colorado…We’re trying to improve all around, but the rebounds are a good start.”
The Crimson finished the contest with a 34-31 edge on the glass, but it was not enough to keep the Buffalo offense at bay. Colorado responded to Harvard’s opening 8-0 run with three consecutive three-pointers, setting the tone for a game marked by streaky scoring.
Despite another Crimson eight-point spurt, the Buffaloes took a 33-32 lead into the locker room.
With the Colorado offense finding its footing, Harvard turned to its defense in the second half to keep the contest close.
The Crimson stole the ball on consecutive possessions, giving Markley two easy buckets and turning a slim deficit into a 39-35 lead with 17:34 remaining. Markley also notched four blocks, pushing her tournament-record total to 10 on the weekend.
“Emma Markley had a great all around game,” junior Christine Matera said. “She is the key for us to play against big teams.”
Harvard built its second-half lead as high as nine points, but in such a back-and-forth battle, it was the little things that undid the Crimson.
The Buffaloes forced 16 turnovers and benefited from a number of foul calls against Harvard, as the teams pulled even at 63 with 1:19 remaining. After Chuck Jeffery put Colorado up with two of her 10 second-half points on a layup, Lippert calmly knocked down two free throws to set up the game’s final possession. Unfortunately for the Crimson, Jeffery converted once again, leaving Harvard on the wrong end of a heated contest.
HARVARD 60, NEW ORLEANS 57
Having taken long flights the day before, both Harvard and the Privateers (3-2) struggled early on to find a rhythm and adjust to the thin Boulder air.
“Both teams were battling the altitude,” Wheeler said. “Neither team played their best game, but we did what we had to do to win.”
Wheeler certainly did her part—netting a team-high 14 points on 4-of-5 from the floor—while sophomore Brogan Berry added 13 to pace the Crimson offense.
Despite the difficult circumstances, Harvard maintained its poise from the charity stripe, hitting all 15 of its free throws—including a pair from Lippert with 2:26 remaining to put the Crimson ahead for good.
In the first half, it did not appear as though Harvard would need clutch free-throw shooting, as it built a 32-26 lead heading into the locker room. But New Orleans refused to go quietly.
The Privateers owned the boards, posting a 53-26 edge in rebounds throughout the contest. By controlling the glass, New Orleans earned itself a 14-2 advantage on points in the paint in the second half as it fought back to a 50-49 lead with 7:24 remaining.
“We weren’t rebounding as well [against New Orleans],” Matera said. “That’s something we need to be more consistent with. But we were playing tough the whole game and were able to just grind it out.”
The teams traded baskets down the stretch, but with the Crimson trailing 57-56, Lippert grabbed a key offensive rebound and drew a foul. After knocking down both free throws, the rookie nailed a jumper with 1:30 remaining to push the lead to three and seal the win for Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a shaky start to the season, there was only one way for the Harvard women’s and men’s fencing teams to go at the Harvard Invitational yesterday, and that way was up.
The Crimson made an impressive showing on the day, as seven nationally-contending teams met in the Gordon Track and Tennis Center, including defending national champion Penn State and Ivy League rival Princeton.
At the end of the tournament, head coach Peter Brand said that both of his teams are right where they should be.
After shaking off their rust last weekend at the Garret Penn State Open, the Harvard fencers seemed to be more comfortable in their shoes, as the women went undefeated and the men followed close behind, only losing close contests to Penn State and Princeton by three bouts each.
“Overall, we made progress over the last year, despite losing a few key players,” Brand said. “The men’s sabre is exceptionally strong this year. We have two terrific freshmen, Thomas Kolasa and Michael Tom, who were great additions.”
Leading the sabre for the second week in a row was sophomore Valentin Staller, who spurred his sabre team to wins over Sacred Heart, 7-2, Penn State, 5-4, Princeton, 5-4, and Vassar, 8-1, with its best win blanking North Carolina, 9-0.
Co-captain épée Karl Harmenberg and sophomore épée James Hawrot lost to Princeton freshman Edward Kelley in extremely close 5-4 bouts, allowing the Tigers to barely surpass the Crimson by three points.
The épée team beat Sacred Heart, Penn State, and Vassar, 7-2, but was unable to push the win over Princeton and North Carolina, losing both matches, 5-4.
The men’s foil struggled throughout the day, posting wins only over Princeton, 6-3, and Vassar, 5-4. No men’s foil fencer was able to win a bout against Penn State, and Harvard fell to Sacred Heart, 7-2, and North Carolina, 5-4, in the weapon.
But the women enjoyed success all around.
Sophomore co-captains Noam Mills and Caroline Vloka led the women’s team for the second week in a row, helping the Crimson defeat all six of its opponents, including Penn State. Harvard just squeaked by the defending national champions by one bout.
The Crimson dominated throughout the tournament, outscoring its opponents 119-43, while Mills and Vloka each went undefeated in their respective weapons.
“Noam Mills and Caroline Vloka fenced extremely well,” Brand said of his co-captains. “It was a significant win for Caroline Vloka over Penn State’s Monica Aksamit.”
Aksamit finished fifth in the country in the sabre last year and helped her team to a national championship—something Vloka wants to bring back to Harvard.
“We aren’t necessarily rivals,” Vloka said, “but we are from the same club. I was really happy that I got that bout. There wasn’t an animosity [between us] per say, but definitely a little tension.”
Joining Vloka in the sabre was freshman Elena Helgiu, who helped the sabre team sweep Sacred Heart and Vassar, 9-0, and best North Carolina, 7-2. The rookie has proven to be the answer to the Crimson’s sabre woes of last year. Sophomore Hayley Levitt also stepped up to help the sabre team surpass Penn State, 5-4. The squad’s only loss in the weapon was to Princeton, 5-4.
“Elena Helgiu is making a big difference for us and is fencing exceptionally well,” Brand said. “Better than I’ve anticipated.”
With Mills going undefeated on the day, the épée team seemed to be the Crimson’s strongest weapon, defeating all six schools present—most notably Princeton, North Carolina, and Sacred Heart by counts of 8-1.
Even with the loss of Olympian Emily Cross ’08-’09, the women’s foil made a strong showing at the invitational, posting wins over Sacred Heart, 5-4, North Carolina, 7-2, and Vassar, 8-1.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just back from Thanksgiving break, the Harvard men’s hockey team wasn’t feeling the holiday cheer after suffering a 6-2 loss to Dartmouth (3-6-0).
The non-league defeat brought the Crimson’s (1-6-2) winless streak to eight games.
“Dartmouth was good—compound that with the fact that we were not very good, and that’s the result we got,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “I don’t wish to demean Dartmouth’s effort, but I thought it was one of our worst games of the season.”
The Big Green outshot the Crimson, 41-29, and scored two goals in each period to snap Dartmouth’s six-game winless streak against its rival.
Big Green forward Scott Fleming continued his offensive dominance with another multi-goal game, bookending the Harvard thumping with first- and third-period goals.
“We came out flat, didn’t come out with any emotion, with no firepower, and we did that consistently throughout the game,” captain Alex Biega said. “It wasn’t just the first period, it was an ongoing event. We didn’t have much passion, much fire out there tonight.”
There were a few redemptive moments on the Crimson power play. Harvard’s special teams killed all three Dartmouth penalties, and sophomore Daniel Moriarty, junior Michael Biega, and freshman Alex Fallstrom seized on the Crimson’s man-advantages to generate some offensive chances against the Big Green.
Tallying the first multi-goal game of his career, Moriarty scored both of Harvard’s goals, with Michael Biega and Fallstrom assisting on both chances. But these efforts were not enough to dig the Crimson out of its early hole.
Outshooting Harvard, 15-10, in the first frame, Dartmouth got the edge at the outset with a two-goal lead, scoring twice on rushes. Fleming launched a wrist shot after taking it up the right side, sending the puck past Crimson netminder Ryan Carroll at 9:58 for his first goal of the game. Dartmouth winger Dustin Walsh followed up with a goal at the end of the period, capitalizing on another outnumbered rush to double the lead 2-0.
“We caused some of our own issues,” Donato said. “Dartmouth gave us things that gave us trouble…but we made some plays where we stayed up off of their rush—whether it was forwards or defensemen—and turned what would have been two-on-two or two-on-three situations into two-on-ones and the like.”
Harvard had a chance to recover when the Big Green’s Connor Goggin was sent to the box for roughing in the first minute of the second period.
After receiving a pass from Michael Biega, Moriarty fed the puck to Fallstrom, who sent a shot at the Dartmouth net. Goaltender Jody O’Neill denied the rookie’s attempt, but Moriarty pounced on the rebound to put the Crimson on the board, 2-1.
In response, the Big Green stepped up its offensive efforts, putting away two more before the period was over and notching back-to-back goals less than a minute apart.
“The first ten minutes of the second period, we had a little jump in our step…but we continued to give up outnumbered rushes, to turn the puck over, and ultimately fed their offensive engine by giving them quality scoring chances,” Donato said.
Harvard outshot the Big Green in the third period, 14-12, but it was too little, too late.
Moriarty let a one-timer fly in the first five minutes of the final frame, securing his second goal of the game. But Dartmouth bounced back with another pair of goals.
Fleming finished off a pass from Matt Reber to extend the lead to 5-2.
And as the Crimson made a last-ditch effort to close the gap, pulling the goalie for nearly two minutes, the Big Green’s Josh Gillam tapped in an empty-netter to seal the score with a four-point advantage.
“It’s really tough to play with confidence when you’re on a losing streak,” Alex Biega said. “When things get tough, the tough get going—that’s the saying we’ve been going with, but we haven’t really been showing it on the ice.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just when it looked like the Harvard and Dartmouth women’s hockey teams might be heading toward overtime last night, junior forward Liza Ryabkina marked her return to the ice with a game-winning goal for the Crimson. Harvard (6-3-1, 6-3 ECAC, 3-2 Ivy) beat Dartmouth (4-4-1, 4-4-1 ECAC, 3-2 Ivy), 3-2, at Bright Hockey Center.
“I thought it was a great hockey game, and the fans enjoyed it,” Crimson coach Katey Stone said. “There was a lot of up and down, a lot of great plays, and a lot of great saves too.”
Senior goalie Christina Kessler had 27 saves in the match, bringing her season save percentage to .940. The mark is just below her career percentage of .941, a stat tied for first among all NCAA goalies.
Even with the impressive numbers, Kessler stuck to the basics.
“You know, a goalie’s job is just to stop the puck,” she said.
Kessler and the rest of the Harvard team got the job done on defense and also showed strong play on the opposite side of the ice. Ryabkina recorded one goal and one assist in her first game of the season after coming back from a dislocated knee. Freshmen Josephine Pucci and Jillian Dempsey each contributed a goal and assist of their own, while co-captain Cori Bassett and junior Kate Buesser added assists as well.
Success throughout the lineup has become characteristic of the Crimson squad—with 15 players recording at least one point so far this season—and was clear in yesterday’s matchup.
“Our team played really, really well as a whole,” Ryabkina said.
While Harvard came out with the victory, the game started with back-and-forth play early in the first period. Neither team seemed to gain an outright advantage, but the Crimson accumulated a 11-2 shot deficit in the frame and didn’t get its first shot on goal until almost 15 minutes in.
“We were off to a slow start,” Stone said. “We didn’t play poorly in the first period, we just couldn’t get to the net and couldn’t get the shots off our stick.”
But with about four minutes left before the break, junior Kate Buesser got the puck behind the Big Green’s net, skated around the front, and crossed it to Dempsey, who was there to put it in for the first goal of the game.
But Harvard’s 1-0 lead lasted only a minute, as Dartmouth quickly responded with a goal from sophomore Jenna Hobeika. The period came to a close with the score tied, 1-1.
The Crimson came out strong and regained its lead less than three minutes into the second frame. When Dartmouth was called for an interference penalty, Pucci took only 15 seconds to score and put the Crimson up 2-1.
Once again, the Big Green wouldn’t stay down for long. After a block and save by Kessler, Dartmouth freshman Sally Komarek scored her first collegiate goal off the rebound to make it a tie game.
Both Harvard and the Big Green had several chances to get ahead before the end of the period, but strong defensive play, key saves by both goalies, and a shot off the crossbar kept the score even going into the final frame.
Each team played aggressively in the third period, but the Crimson showed its talent, racking up an 18-4 shot advantage even against a persistent Dartmouth offense.
“Defensively we came out strong in the third,” Kessler said.
Harvard’s offense also had a number of opportunities to score, but as the clock wound down it was still a 2-2 game.  Pucci then got a hold of the puck with a little over three minutes left in the game and took a slap shot on goal. Big Green goalie Mariel Lacina got the stop, but Ryabkina was there for the rebound and snuck the puck over the line to give Harvard the lead.
“It felt amazing,” the forward said. “I think that was one of the most fun times that I’ve had.”
Ryabkina’s goal turned out to be the game-winner, as the Crimson held strong and secured the 3-2 victory over the Ivy League rival.
“In the end it was great to come away with a win,” Kessler said, “especially against Dartmouth.”

After a holiday weekend away from Cambridge,  the toughest adjustment that we students face may not be from West Coast waves to East Coast  ice or from snoozing to studying. Rather, the harshest reality  check might have come as a punch to the stomach.
The end of break means the departure of the glorious  tastes of Thanksgiving (and its leftovers) and a return to the basics: HUDS.
As students made their way back to  Harvard with their luggage and the extra post-holiday pounds, they were welcomed back to campus with (drum roll, please)...baked  ziti in sausage sauce.
Mom’s home-roasted turkey was replaced  with Jerk 8-Cut Chicken.  Instead of sweet potatoes and stuffing,  the dining halls offered Sticky Rice (remember, that’s really what they call  it). Yum.
A few students embraced HUDS’s welcome-back  effort.
“I really enjoyed it," Bethan G. N. Williams  ’11 told us. "Sunday night  is great because of the rustic bread.”
Others attempted—but left unsatisfied.
“I filled my tray with food, but  realized none of it was really edible,” said Beñat A Idoyaga  ’12. “Then I headed to Yenching.”
Dessert, at least, received better  feedback. Sundae Sundays rarely disappoint.

FlyBy went to try to knock a paper out of the way in the 3rd Floor Widener Reading Room when it started raining. Inside. In the library. Where there are books. Made from paper.
Yayy Harvard. Nothing like possible electrocution to get you ready for finals period.
We're going to relocate to some place where we don't need an umbrella, but for now, check out the pictures and don't repeat our mistake.

With reading period happening before winter break this year, someone has to provide the holiday goodies Mom used to stuff us with at home to ease the stress of finals. Luckily, the UC has put away all the election drama to offer their version of comfort food with a Reading Period Giveaway.
However, in an effort to create excitement or, we suspect, boost their following online, the UC has chosen to keep their giveaway schedule under wraps until Reading Period actually begins. Students will have to check Facebook, Twitter, or the UC Juicy blog between Dec. 4-11 to find out how to get their hands on free food and drinks.
Granted, out mothers wouldn’t exactly approve of loading up on caffeine to facilitate pulling all-nighters (the menu includes coffee, energy drinks, and other “fueling boosters”), but we will certainly appreciate the UC's effort.  After all, there will also be some healthier options, including breakfast sandwiches and smoothies from Quincy Grille and possibly frozen yogurt from Berryline.
And if you’re really trying to avoid the Freshman Fifteen, there's something for you too—not everything being given away is edible.  The UC will also be hosting a “Stressbusters” event that will include free backrubs.
Whether all of this is a desperate ploy to inspire a virtual fan base or a genuine attempt to curb the stress of cramming for finals, one thing's for sure: no one’s saying no to free stuff.

Initiates to the Isis Club, the last of the female final clubs to do ridiculous shit around campus, danced outside the Science Center today around noon. The ladies braved the rain—navy blazers and all—to perform for a crowd that consisted of a handful of tourists, bemused students, and a smattering of other final club members.
