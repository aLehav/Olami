After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Like opening the doors to Willy Wonka’s Chocolate Factory, much—from the most sumptuous to the most terrifying—can be anticipated in the lead-up to tUnE-yArDs’s forthcoming album. “Nikki Nack” was born out of a long three years for tUnE-yArDs‘s bandmaster, Merrill Garbus. Since Garbus’s last album, 2011’s “w h o k i l l,” which was lauded for its brilliantly low-fidelity aesthetic and innovative experimental/indie pop sound, Garbus has spent much time on tour, confronting all the while the prospect of aging, the influence of her addiction-infested surroundings in Oakland, and her authenticity as an artist. These issues, in addition to several more provocative ones, are among those addressed on her newest album, which excels indubitably in restoring Garbus’s inventive spirit but falls short at times in providing a cohesive listening experience.
The first moments of “Nikki Nack” are downright petrifying. With a looped electro-harpsichord playing what feels like a corrupted renaissance ballad, there is an immediate and visceral sense that Garbus has gone straight off the deep end and intends on bring us all down with her. But “Find a New Way,” “Nikki Nack”’s first track, is truly about Garbus’s rebirth, her musical renaissance out of the sterile state she had come to occupy in recent years. And, as the song’s name suggests, it was indeed willpower that drove Garbus through the formidable and inelegant process of revival. “Find a New Way” proceeds to showcase a cadre of spastic electronic drum beats, as if to reenact Garbus’s own experimental regimen during her recalibration with and integration into the estranged frequencies of the musical world. Garbus never exactly settles rhythmically  in “Find a New Way,” nor does she in the album as a whole. She toys between syncopations, appealing all the while to Haitian beats inspired by her tour abroad and a diverse assortment of bells, chimes, and clappers. Rarely can the listener get comfortable; comfort often entails understanding, and understanding can make music sound predictable. And if one thing is for certain, “Nikki Nack” is in no way predictable, providing, for the most part, delightful surprises, but occasionally shortchanging itself by cutting short refrains that deserve sustaining.
“Find a New Way” serves as an excellent introduction not only to the album’s narrative, but also to its stylistic intentions. On a foundational level, Garbus’s music overlaps with a definitively modern brand of musical experimentalism, characterized by an interest in dissonance and conceptions of elegance, a proclivity for jestful irony, an obsession with sonority, and a tinge of insouciance. Just before the 2:30 mark in “Find a New Way,” however, Garbus’s vocals lighten up and exit the choppy, almost robotic incantation that preceded. “When I see you changing, it makes me think that I can change too,” Garbus merrily sings, marking a distinct section of the song whose purity and catchiness hints at a new tUnE-yArDs dimension, one that diverges from classical influences by The Dirty Projectors and Animal Collective in favor of new sounds reminiscent of more cheery artists, such as MIKA, Michael Jackson, or even M.I.A.
The second track, “Water Fountain,” provides incontestable confirmation of this refurbished element of the tUnE-yArDs persona, bursting now with childlike elation, buoyant rhythms, and delightfully simple basslines. In “Water Fountain,” tUnE-yArDs turns to the schoolyard as its musical lab, toying with the claps one might find in a children's handgame and the clinking of a recess bell. The song is not all fun and games, however. At one point, Garbus adopts an apathetic tone of voice and, as a child might, admits, “I saved up all my pennies and I gave them to this special guy / ...He gave me a dollar, a blood-soaked dollar / I cannot get the spot out, but it’s okay; / it still works in the store.” Not unfamiliar with addressing political issues through song, Garbus appears in her lyrics to be implicating capitalist America as a corruptive and inhumane force, penetrating, within the context of this song, even our children’s elementary education. Garbus retreats after to the wonderfully poppy and summery chorus, successfully integrating the tUnE-yArDs proclivity for confronting serious concerns into their revamped sound.
In “Real Thing,” Garbus both lyrically and sonically questions her authenticity as an artist and, apparently, her artistry in such tracks as “Water Fountain.” The track opens with a smooth and compelling R&B background. It is soon interrupted, however, by a jarring and mournful cry, declaring, “I am no real thing.” The next line follows with, “They say I am the real thing,” and a catchy back-and-forth is established between Garbus’s denial of her authenticity and others’ affirmation of it. Throughout the song, we hear much of the pleasant vocals and harmonies that characterize the renewed tUnE-yArDs. Occasionally, however, unsettling refrains that are more standard to the tUnE-yArDs previous work creeps in as well. This ongoing struggle between multiple musical and personal identities can be found in many of the album’s tracks, perhaps most poignantly in “Hey Life” and “Left Behind.” Garbus’s exploration of this struggle, though intriguing, can prove disorienting, as she seems to remain a bit musically and narratively confused throughout.
 
It is ultimately hard to say what binds the album together. The search for identity certainly reappears, as in “Rocking Chair,” which presents Garbus meditating through a Haitian rhythm, trying to cope with her echoed solicitations for sleep. Gender roles are broached as well, such as in “Manchild,” in which Garbus plays on Michael Jackson’s “Beat It” to question men on their sexual practices. As in “Water Fountain,” political issues are on Garbus’s mind as well. Even without one obvious underlying theme, however, the album is an overall success. Garbus engages with profound questions, provides the listener with a diverse musical experience—from the get-on-your-feet-and-dance to the listen-up-and-brood—and maintains control of her sounds in each of these pursuits. Though the album cannot boast a reliable pleasantness or comfort in its musical offering, its innovation, uniqueness, and occasional flashes of pure ecstasy do more than enough to justify its worth as a truly outstanding piece of work.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
UPDATED: May 11, 2014, at 2:37 a.m.
Despite condemnation by the Archdiocese of Boston, Harvard Chaplains, student religious groups, and many alumni and students on campus, an organization of Harvard Extension School students will move forward with plans to host a staging of a satanic “black mass” on campus on Monday.
A black mass ceremony is a ritual performed by satanic cults to parody the Catholic Church Mass. Historically, the ceremony features a ritual of sacrilege of the Catholic host, or the sacred bread used in the Eucharist, which becomes the body of Jesus Christ upon consecration.


The performance, which will take place Monday night at Cambridge Queen’s Head Pub in the basement of Memorial Hall, is organized by the Extension School’s Cultural Studies Club with help from the New York-based Satanic Temple.
The ceremony will model the script of the black mass articulated in novelist Joris-Karl Huysmans’ work “Là-Bas,” although a consecrated host will not be used. In addition, Christopher Robichaud, an ethics and public policy professor at the Kennedy School of Government, will speak at the demonstration to frame the event in terms of religious liberty and tolerance, according to the club.
In a statement posted to the school’s website on Friday, Extension School Dean of Students and Alumni Affairs Robert H. Neugeboren '83 said that though the School does not endorse activities of individual student organizations, it will “support the rights of our students and faculty to speak and assemble freely.” The statement followed a similar post on the Extension School’s website on Wednesday that affirmed the club’s right to host the event.
“We do not agree with the [Cultural Studies Club’s] decision to stage an event that is so deeply disturbing and offensive to many in the Harvard community and beyond,” the statement read. “While we support the ability of all our students to explore difficult issues, we also encourage them to do so in ways that are sensitive to others.”
To address concerns about the event, the Extension School ensured that the reenactment would not make use of a consecrated host and also encouraged Cultural Studies Club student leaders to “foster a positive dialogue” with Catholic student organizations, according to Neugeboren’s statement.
The club said that the events were motivated by educational purposes only in the statement posted on the Extension School’s website Wednesday.
“Our purpose is not to denigrate any religion or faith, which would be repugnant to our educational purposes, but instead to learn and experience the history of different cultural practices,” the club said.
Several on- and off-campus groups have raised objections to the event.
The Harvard Chaplains, a group of religious and spiritual leaders who, according to their website, represent a diverse array of spiritual and religious practices, expressed concern about the event, which they said is a reenactment of a ritual that mocks foundational beliefs held by many Christians about the importance of Holy Communion.
“Just because something may be permissible does not make it right or good,” Reverend Luther Zeigler, President of the Harvard Chaplains, wrote in a statement to The Crimson on behalf of the Chaplains. “Whether or not these students are ‘entitled’ to express themselves through the ceremony of a ‘black mass’ as a matter of law or University policy is a distinct question from whether this is a healthy form of intellectual discourse or community life. We submit it is not.”
The Archdiocese of Boston, which oversees Catholic churches and schools in the area, also denounced the event.
“This activity separates people from God and the human community, it is contrary to charity and goodness, and it places participants dangerously close to destructive works of evil,” the Archdiocese wrote in a statement earlier in the week.
In response, the Cultural Studies Club wrote in an email to The Crimson that its reenactment should not be seen as offensive.
“The event does not promote hate or incite violence, and it does not silence anyone. The complaints are founded metaphysical concerns, and there is simply a disagreement with regards to how this faith is practiced,” the club wrote.
“The flawed assumption seems to be that because Satan is the representation of evil incarnate for some faiths, that Satanist[s] are part of a hate group and their practice devoted towards denigrating Catholicism,” the organization’s statement continued. “The point of this event is to challenge the stigmatization of marginalized groups.” 
With the event scheduled for Monday, some groups have made efforts to try to cancel the event or demonstrate against it.
A petition opposing the event, organized by Matthew R. Menendez ’14, has, according to Menendez, received the signatures of 370 Harvard students and 100 alumni. The petition demands that the University prevent the event from taking place because it “offends all who have faith in Christ” and “promotes contempt for the Catholic faith.”
Menendez, a member of the Harvard Catholic Student Association, said that many Catholics like himself are offended by the event, which he deems hateful and unproductive. 
“We found that this is embarrassing to the Harvard community and not only attacks our religion as Catholics in a very direct way, but in no way promotes an open intellectual dialogue,” Menendez said. “There are other ways to educate, and it does not seem that having something that is so hateful fits the mission of Harvard. It is unfair to portray this as an educational or cultural event, when it is a mockery.”
Menendez said that, due to the demonstration, he is not planning on donating to the Senior Gift. He also said that he thinks that the event will have lasting implications for University community.
“It exposes other groups to the possibility of similar hateful speech, and we do not think this is the kind of thing that is conducive to having an intellectual dialogue,” Menendez said.
In response to the “black mass” demonstration, the Archdiocese announced Friday that it plans to hold a prayer vigil on Monday followed by a Eucharistic procession to St. Paul Church, which will subsequently hold a “holy hour.” Harvard College Faith and Action has also scheduled a prayer event in response to the reenactment, according to Olivia J. Krusel '15, the organization’s vice president.
Despite repeated requests for comment, the Cultural Studies Club has not responded to questions about its leadership or membership, although it did say that its formulation required 10 members.

With words and images, Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Art Spiegelman illustrated the history of comics and his own career as a cartoon artist at Sanders Theatre Friday evening. The event, titled “What the %@&*! Happened to Comics?” was hosted by the Celebrity Series of Boston, an organization that brings performers and artists to characteristic venues in Boston.
Spiegelman, who gained acclaim in 1991 for a graphic novel on the Holocaust, “Maus,” began his chronological tour of comics by sharing images of original drawings and blueprints by artists from the earliest days of comic strips. The images showed techniques on how to tweak physical attributes like jawlines and nose structures to turn a geek into a mobster, or a white man into a black man.
“The visual language has contributed to both creating and reinforcing racial and cultural stereotypes,” Spiegelman said.
He went on to speak about the distinctive structure of comics, which he said is useful for communicating messages usually difficult to illustrate on paper. Memory, for example, can be shown with two different events happening at the same time on either side of the page, Spiegelman said.
“Comics are a medium that can allow you to give form to your thoughts and feelings,” Spiegelman said. “They are like sheet music, they allow you to turn space into time.”
Spiegelman led the audience through a series of famous comics, explaining how the artists have manipulated each page with different images and actions that guide the eye in a desired order.  He also spoke about the power and influence comics can have on raising support for political causes, illustrating the point with political cartoons from World War II, which he said contributed to public support for American involvement in Hiroshima.
Spiegelman then discussed his time working for The New Yorker, displaying the first front page cartoon he drew for the magazine in 1993. The image, a drawing of a Hasidic Jewish man kissing an African American woman, was a response to conflicts that were occurring between the two groups in New York at the time. This first cartoon was very controversial, Spiegelman said, adding that he received many critical emails and letters after its publication.
Spiegelman said he believes that in a “post-literature world,” comics will regain popularity because of their readability and usefulness for providing quick bursts of humor and information.
“The past continues to hang over the future,” he said.
Audience member and cartoon enthusiast Eve Asher said she “was most interested when [Spiegelman] talked about visual language and how facial stereotypes spill over into racial stereotypes.”
“I was also surprised at how funny of a guy he is,” she said.
Eli Dreyfus, a Cambridge resident and admirer of Spiegelman, said that he thought the event was “a nice retrospect of the form.”
“It was even more great to hear the insider breakdown of a couple of illustrations,” he said. “I liked getting his insights on different popular comics because he can find one level more detail than we can.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
UPDATED: May 13, 2014, at 3:30 p.m.
A crowd of about 40 people held banners, waved balloons, and even played classical music outside of Sanders Theatre on Sunday to protest violinist Vladimir T. Spivakov, who performed there that evening, for the musician’s support of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s actions in Ukraine.
The protesters, ranging from Ariella P. Katz, a student at Brookline High School, to David Gamarnik, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan School of Management, gathered on the sidewalk on the north side of Memorial Hall clutching posters with messages like “Make Music, Not War” and “Shame on Spivakov, Your Conductor is Putin.”


Spivakov was among several hundred cultural figures who signed a letter expressing their support for the Russian government’s intervention in Ukraine and Crimea.
 
“In the days when the fate of Crimea and our countrymen is being decided, Russia's cultural figures cannot remain indifferent, cold-hearted observers,” reads a translation of the letter, which was published on March 11 by the Russian Culture Ministry. “We want the commonality of our peoples and our cultures to have a strong future. This is why we firmly declare our support of the position of the President of the Russian Federation in regards to Ukraine and Crimea.”
The letter prompted a harsh reaction from those who do not support the annexation of the Crimean peninsula, including those at Sunday’s protest.
“When we realized that he did this and he would be in our town acting like nothing happened, we thought that wasn’t right,” said Maria M. Tyutyunik, a Boston area resident. “We wanted to make sure that he regrets this at least somehow and that people are aware that this is not just a famous musician but someone who supports Putin.”
Spivakov visited Harvard as the conductor and violin soloist in the Moscow Virtuosi Chamber Orchestra, which performed in Sanders as one stop in a larger tour honoring the Orchestra’s 35th anniversary.
Several of the protesters reached out to the organizers of the concert, Maestro Artist Management Company, asking them to cancel the event.
“They refused on the ground that this is an organization that has to do with arts and not politics,” Gamarnik said.
The protest movement, which will span across the United States and Canada during Spivakov’s tour, has also garnered over 2,000 signatures to cancel the concerts, according to Dmitry Smelansky, a software engineer from Brighton and one of the protest’s organizers.
Multiple Harvard University Police Department officers stood at the entrances to Memorial Hall, directing protesters off of Harvard’s property to the nearby sidewalks.
The letter which Spivakov signed was published just days before Crimean citizens—a majority of whom speak Russian—voted in favor of unification with the Russian Federation. The validity of the vote has been widely quesioned, but when these results were officially announced, Putin approved the admission of Crimea into Russia.
The annexation came amid growing tensions in Ukraine, whose pro-Moscow president Viktor Yanukovych was driven from power by violent protests in the country earlier this year, prompting Kremlin-backed military forces to seize control of the Crimean peninsula.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s lacrosse team ended its season in South Bend, Ind. on Saturday in a hard-fought contest decided by momentum. Despite battling, the Crimson could not recover after Notre Dame jumped out to an early lead.
Harvard (10-7, 5-1 Ivy) took on the sixth-seeded Fighting Irish (10-5, 2-3 ACC) in the first round of the NCAA Tournament—the Crimson’s first tournament appearance since 2006—and was ultimately topped by the home team, 13-5.
“It was a disappointing outcome,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “Notre Dame started out the game strong. They were pressuring early and forced a couple of turnovers on the clear…. We couldn’t really settle down in the first quarter.”
The Irish came out quickly, beginning the first period with a three-goal run, and continuing into the second period of play with another four unanswered points.
“Notre Dame started out the game…[by] really putting the pressure on,” co-captain defenseman Joe Petrucci said. “They forced a number of turnovers early, but our shooting really wasn’t great. That was a major factor in the game.”
Harvard was unable to find the back of the net until almost 24 minutes of play had elapsed.
“They were up early, 7-0, and that is a very tough [position] to get yourself out of,” Petrucci said. “But we battled back in the second half. We we cut that lead that they had in the third quarter, but it was too little, too late.”
Sophomore Will Walker scored the first goal of the afternoon for the Crimson, and just a few minutes later Walker passed to the ready stick of classmate Devin Dwyer, who got another mark on the scoreboard for the Crimson.
Harvard continued its scoring push with two more shots past the stick of Notre Dame goalie Conor Kelly, cutting the deficit to 7-4.
“We are a very resilient group of guys,” co-captain midfielder Peter Schwartz said. “And we have been down before this year, so we never thought we were out of it until [Notre Dame] gained the momentum back in its final scoring drive.”
Unfortunately for the Crimson, the Irish defense ultimately crushed the Harvard attack. The Crimson tallied only one more point on the afternoon, while Notre Dame countered with another six goals before the final whistle blew.
“I think that a real challenge for us was our shooting today,” Wojcik said. “I don’t really think we were finishing our shots.”
The Harvard offense outshot its opponent, 35-33, but only 22 of those shots were placed between the posts. The Crimson, which had averaged 10.7 goals per game this season, has struggled this week to put the ball past opposing goalies. The attackers tallied just five goals against Penn in the Ivy League Tournament final last Sunday.
“We just have been shooting poorly overall,” Schwartz said. “But at the same time, I think we made [the Notre Dame goalie] look pretty good.”
Kelly lunged for 17 saves and never let Notre Dame’s lead drop to fewer than three points, while Crimson goalie Jake Gambitsky had a season-low five blocks on the afternoon.
“Notre Dame was generating some really high quality shots,” Wojcik said. “You can’t ask your goalie to make saves when Notre Dame is shooting from that close. I think our entire defense wasn’t allowing Jake to see the shots that we wanted him to see.”
Notre Dame player John Scioscia added four more goals to his 21 on the season, thanks in large part to accurate passes from All-American teammate Matt Kavanaugh.
“We got outplayed every phase of the game,” Petrucci said. “They were tougher than we were on the ground, and that was a big factor of the game. But overall, Notre Dame was the better team today.”
The loss marks the end of the Crimson’s 2014 season. Despite the defeat, the Harvard men’s lacrosse program still has much to celebrate and to look forward to in the 2015 campaign, according to Wojcik.
“One game doesn’t define the season,” Wojcik said. “I am really proud of what the players did this year. We won the Ivy League for the first time in 24 years and we advanced to the [NCAA] Tournament. I am very proud of the team and what they accomplished.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A few weeks after capturing its third straight Ivy League title, the Harvard women’s golf team earned its best finish in program history at the NCAA Central Regional at the Karsten Creek Country Club in Stillwater, Okla.
Having recently been crowned Ivy League Rookie of the Year, freshman Anne Cheng added to her accolades with a top-10 finish, and the squad took 13th out of 24 teams to conclude the year.
With the top eight groups from the regional qualifying for the NCAA Championship, the Crimson women were just nine strokes off the pace, a year after finishing 24 from the eighth spot at last year’s regional.
“Certainly, we’re getting closer to [qualifying] every year and making that a reality,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads said. “And [nine] shots over three days with five players—that’s really nothing—that could be done in a heartbeat.... I thought our games, with what we need to do when we go to Regionals, were very good.”
Third-ranked UCLA shot one-under par as a group on the final day and finished the event 17 shots ahead of ninth-ranked Alabama to take the tournament victory. The top eight finishers each came into the contest ranked in the top 40 nationally, with eight other ranked teams failing to make the final cut.
Cheng pieced together three solid rounds in her first showing at the national competition. Consistency was key for the freshman, who carded a 72, 73, and 74 for a three-round finish at three-over par.
Despite playing three rounds at what Rhoads deemed “one of the toughest courses in college golf,” Cheng didn’t have a single double-bogey or worse the whole tournament.
“The fairways weren’t extremely narrow, but if you accidentally missed a fairway, then you were almost guaranteed to be in a hazard,” Cheng said. “The greens were difficult to read, which made things tough.”
Cheng attributed much of her lack of stress on the course to Rhoads’ words before the tournament.
“In the beginning, [Rhoads] emphasized process and taking one shot at a time, and that there were no expectations so long as we did our best and what we were supposed to do,” Cheng said. “And now after the tournament, he was very happy with our performance and couldn’t have asked for anything better.”
Shooting out of the number three position for the Crimson, sophomore Christine Lin finished tied for 32nd with a total score of 226. The second-team All-Ivy golfer improved her score with each day and jumped 18 spots on the last day.
Despite turning in three bogeys in the first five holes, Lin turned in a final round score of 74.
“I had a rough start [on day three], and I missed a few putts,” Lin said. “I think I was a little nervous going into the first few holes because I wanted to perform well for the team because I knew that today was very important.”
But after the bumpy ride through the first five, the sophomore rebounded to finish the last 13 holes of her second season at one-under par.
“I got a glimpse of the scoreboard after the first few holes and saw that my team was doing pretty well,” Lin said. “It gave me a lot of inspiration to keep pushing forward and not to get too down about my first few bogeys and finish strong in the end.”
Competing in her third NCAA Regional, junior Brenna Nelsen, who is also a Crimson sports executive, was the third-best Harvard golfer for the tournament. Despite shooting 14-over par on the back nine over the three rounds, she finished with consistent scores of 78, 79, and 78 to help keep the Crimson in the hunt for a qualifying position.
Junior Tiffany Lim and senior Bonnie Hu both had some struggles on the course on Thursday, with the former shooting three double-bogeys and the latter finishing with two double-bogeys and a triple-bogey of her own.
But despite the rough start, both had more success on day two, with Lim holing out three birdies to finish with a 75, and Hu shooting one-over par on both the front and back nine to card a 74.
Overall, the Crimson improved greatly on its NCAA Regional performance after coming in 20th at last year’s West Regional at Stanford, Calif.
“I think we did a really good job, and we have a lot of confidence in each other and each other’s games,” Lim said. “I don’t think we’re ever intimidated by any other teams…. For this tournament, we saw ourselves as a competitor, and I think we fulfilled that."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s tennis team entered its first-round NCAA Tournament matchup as the 31st-ranked team in the country, and the second seed in its four-team region in Norman, Okla.
On one hand, this was good news, as it meant that the Crimson (18-7, 6-1 Ivy) would have a relatively easy first round matchup in No. 42 Auburn (14-14, 4-8 SEC). Harvard dispatched the Tigers, 4-1, in a tight contest on Saturday afternoon.
But on the other hand, the Crimson’s relatively low national ranking meant that it faced No. 2 Oklahoma (25-3, 4-1 Big 12) in the second round. On Sunday afternoon, Harvard hung with the host Sooners in doubles, but was outpaced in singles as Oklahoma captured a 4-0 win.
The Crimson has now tallied NCAA Tournament victories and advanced to the Round of 32 in each of the past three seasons. The squad also improved its all-time national championship record to 16-23.
“It’s never fun when the season comes to an end, but we came up against a tough team today,” junior co-captain Alex Steinroeder said. “They were a very good team that we would’ve needed to play very well [against] to beat.”
OKLAHOMA 4, HARVARD 0
For the third straight year, Harvard went down in the second round of the NCAA Tournament, again succumbing to a top-ranked school from a major conference after losses to Florida in 2012 and Mississippi State last season.
The doubles pair co-captain Casey MacMaster and junior Denis Nguyen, ranked 19th in the country and preparing for an appearance at the NCAA Individual Championships in late May, led consistently and pulled out an 8-5 win on the first court. Freshman Brian Yeung and sophomore Nicky Hu lost on court two, leaving the doubles point up to the third position.
Junior Christo Schultz and freshman Sebastian Beltrame were locked in a tight battle on court three. After having led, 6-4, the duo saved three match points to hold and make the score 7-7, sending the contest into a tiebreak.
Each team had multiple match points in the tiebreak, but the Sooners ultimately converted, winning, 12-10, in the break and taking home the doubles point.
“The arena was in absolute pandemonium during the finish of the doubles,” Harvard coach Dave Fish said. “It was the most exciting doubles point I’d ever seen.”
In singles, Harvard could not compete with the top of Oklahoma’s lineup. Beltrame, worn down from the doubles battle, promptly fell, 6-0, 6-1, on the second court, and Nguyen went down, 6-2, 6-2, in the top spot.
After Yeung went down, 7-6, 6-0, the contested doubles were forgotten, the match was over, and the Sooners were moving on.
“They’re ranked No. 2, and it’s easy to see why,” Fish said. “The firepower they have is remarkable…. The [Sooners] are so talented that we can play on a good level, but they just play on a great level.”
HARVARD 4, AUBURN 1
On Saturday, the Crimson faltered in doubles, but played strongly enough in singles to capture the 4-1 win and extend its all-time record against Auburn to 4-1.
Hu and Yeung went down, 3-0, but gradually regained serve before being broken one final time and losing, 8-6. Nguyen and MacMaster went up, 3-0, en route to an easy 8-4 victory, but Beltrame and Schultz were broken and went down, 8-6.
“The team had been playing really great at the end of the regular season,” Fish said. “But we seemed to lose a little coordination after not playing for a few weeks, and came out slowly.”
But Harvard turned things around quickly, winning all six first sets. Hu cruised through his match at No. 6, winning, 6-0, 6-3, and junior Shaun Chaudhuri followed suit with a 6-1, 6-2 triumph.
All of a sudden, fears of an early exit were replaced by a 2-1 lead. Steinroeder came through with a 6-3, 6-1 victory to put the Crimson one match away from advancing.
Beltrame and Nguyen had dropped their second sets, and with Yeung down a break in the second, the match was competitive yet again. But Yeung rebounded and then blanked his opponent in the tiebreak, 7-0, to complete the rally and send Auburn home.
And now, the Sooners have sent Harvard home for the summer. The Crimson failed to defend its Ivy title—this year’s champion, Columbia, advanced to the Round of 16—but the season was a success, according to Fish.
“I’m really proud of the guys,” Fish said. “This was a young team that got better throughout the season, shook off the loss to Columbia at the beginning of Ivies, swept through the rest, and made it to NCAAs. They showed their mettle this weekend.”
