After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A recent international survey from the Harvard School of Public Health revealed both widespread awareness and anxiety about Alzheimer’s disease in the United States and Europe.
More than 85 percent of subjects in the five countries surveyed said that they would prefer to know earlier rather than later if they had Alzheimer’s diesease. Alzheimer’s disease was found to be the second most feared health condition after cancer in four of the five countries surveyed.
The study also found that more than 85 percent of surveyed adults were able to identify common symptoms of the disease, such as confusion and getting lost.
Alzheimer's disease is a condition characterized by progressive neurodegeneration and loss of brain functions, such as memory and language skills.
Besides shedding light on the widespread fear of developing Alzheimer’s, the results also highlighted two prevalent misconceptions about the disease.
Across the five countries, 27 to 63 percent of respondents said they believed there is treatment that can slow the progression of the disease, and 38 to 59 percent said they believed there is a definitive test to determine if a patient was suffering from the disease. Both of these statements are inaccurate.
“Many of the public have high expectations about the possibilities of treatment alternatives and medical testing,” said co-author and School of Public Health Professor Robert J. Blendon in a press release. “It is important for doctors to talk to patients about what treatment and testing options are or are not available.”
In addition, almost 40 percent of Americans and more than 50 percent of Europeans surveyed were unaware that Alzheimer’s disease is a fatal condition.
Still, the vast majority of respondents indicated that they supported increased government funding for Alzheimer’s research and would immediately contact doctors if they or family members exhibited telltale symptoms of the disease.
Co-authored by Blendon, School of Public Health researcher John M. Benson, and colleagues at Alzheimer Europe, the study included telephone interviews with 2,678 adults from the United States, Spain, France, Germany, and Poland.
The researchers presented the results of their survey last Wednesday in Paris at the Alzheimer Association’s International Conference, a six-day event where scientists from around the world gathered to discuss the disease.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An M2 bus caught fire on Monday in the Longwood Medical Area, forcing the evacuation of the small number of commuters traveling on the bus.
As the bus was pulling away from Vanderbilt Hall at around 4:30 p.m., a residence building on the corner of Longwood Avenue and Avenue Louis Pasteur, a man came out of Vanderbilt to alert the driver and passengers that a part of the bus was aflame, according to Andrew J. Olive, a passenger on the bus.
Olive, a graduate student in microbiology and immunobiology at Harvard Medical School, said he could smell something burning in the air but did not see anything on fire.
In a statement, Diana C. Pisciotta, a spokesperson for the company that manages the shuttles, said that another bus driver notified the dispatcher and the driver about smoke coming out of the back of the bus.
Six people, including the driver, were on board, she said.
Upon exiting, Olive and the other passengers moved away from the bus, which was still “dropping fire balls” from the back, and walked down Avenue Louis Pasteur towards Boston Latin School, Olive said. Five minutes later, the fire department showed up and blocked off the area.
On Tuesday, an inspector from the Department of Public Utilities found that a malfunction of the alternator caused a belt to burn, Pisciotta said in the statement. That caused the hydraulic fuel tank to rupture, fueling the fire.
“It was a very minor issue,” she said in a phone interview. ‘The bus was taken out of service for repairs, and no one was hurt.”
Boston Fire Department spokesperson Steve MacDonald confirmed that when the fire department showed up, all passengers were safely off the bus. The firefighters extinguished the fire in the back of the bus, and no one was injured.
By that time, a crowd had gathered, with passersby snapping photos and taking videos of the incident, Olive said.

In support of an anti-bullying campaign for LGBT youth, affiliates of the Harvard Graduate School of Education released a video today that seeks to deliver one simple message: It gets better.
The four-minute video contains interviews with Ed School faculty, staff, and students in which they share their experiences.
The testimonials in the video are unscripted, the school said in a press release. Kathleen McCartney, the dean of the Graduate School of Education, emailed school affiliates inviting them to share their stories.
The video is a contribution to the It Gets Better Project, which seeks to assure LGBT youth who may face bullying or harassment that their lives will improve. The project was created following the suicides of several gay teenagers who were bullied due to their sexual orientation.

First there was "Dear Harvard," the song that then-high school senior Grace Oberhofer wrote and sang to Harvard admissions in April in hopes of letting her off the wait list.
Now, after receiving a firm "no" from Harvard and seeing Tufts become her college of choice, the singer-songwriter has graced us with her latest letter: "Dearest Tufts."
Clad in a Tufts earflap hat and her signature geeky glasses, Oberhofer serenades Tufts' mascot, Jumbo the elephant.
"Tufts, you are the one, and I will carry on with you," she sings in the refrain. "Tufts, I'll be your Jumbo, together we'll paint the sky blue."
Enjoy.

While most Harvard students learned about Friday’s attacks in Norway from afar, Odd-Jorgen Maeland ’13 was spending the summer at home in Bergen, less than 300 miles away from Oslo.
“[Norway] is small enough that when you hit a summer camp that draws kids from around the country, everybody knows somebody that's a friend of a friend, or a relative of a friend,” said Maeland. “It seems like everyone is grieving together.”
He said that the attacks' impact truly hit Saturday morning, when death toll reports rose overnight from an estimated 16 victims to over 90, an increase due entirely to more reported deaths from the summer camp shooting. (Reports later brought the figure down to 76.)
“We didn't think [a bombing] would happen here, but we always knew there was a chance of something like that happening,” Maeland said. “It's the butchering of the kids that's really gotten to everyone.”
Commemoration of the massacre has been widespread, Maeland said. At noon on Monday, Scandinavian countries observed one minute of silence for the victims. Even traffic and public transportation came to a standstill. Maeland later attended a torchlight vigil in Bergen. The downtown square was packed, he said, with 50,000 people from across the city coming to hear speeches, many from those who knew the victims personally.
“It's etched into everyone's consciousness,” he said. “It will be, even more so, as we see names and pictures of faces of people who've been killed, as we hear more stories from survivors.”
Maeland speculated that the goal of the gunman, a right-wing extremist, “may have been to protest the direction that society’s going, allowing more multiculturalism, more immigration, and more openness, in what's generally been an isolated corner of the world.”
Yet in the end, Maeland said, the attacks have only brought Norwegians closer together.
“The monstrosity of this has broken down every other barrier that might be there between us. It doesn't matter if you're a Pakistani immigrant in eastern Oslo or if you're somebody from northern Norway who’s only ever been around other people from Norway," Maeland said. "You both sent your kids to this camp and they died."
