After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A few years ago, just as many were getting fit during the COVID-19 pandemic, I was doing my best not to.
After spending — *checks watch* — a third of my life with body dysmorphia and disordered eating, which led to mental and physical health repercussions, I decided that I’d nip the issue in the bud, hunkered at home during my gap year. But even though terms like diet culture and fatphobia have finally entered more mainstream vernacular, our increasing awareness of these issues feels like paltry gratification.
Don’t get me wrong: I fist-pumped at the trend of people imitating “almond moms,” satirizing comments from parents contributing to unhealthy body image. I cheered when Taylor Swift removed a music video scene perpetuating the stigma of being fat (an adjective that some are reclaiming as a neutral or empowering descriptor). And I did the splits when magazines like Ellie announced that fitness trends were shifting away from the “be as thin as possible!” paradigm, instead emphasizing non-weight-loss goals.
Still, our shifts toward so-called body empowerment may simply veil the notion of a “default” body.
Take weightlifting. The look and messaging of many mainstream female fitness influencers promotes a toned aesthetic with minimal body fat; any excess must be in the ostensibly right places (e.g. the buttocks).
So isn’t that just another physical ideal in disguise, like the displacement of ultra-thinness with “slim thick”? (Although recent fashion trends, and the weight loss of previously-curvy cultural influencers like Kim and Khloe Kardashian, may signal a resurgence of the super-thin and notably controversial “heroin chic” look of the 1990s).
Moreover, gyms and workout classes like SoulCycle often pride themselves on their inclusive, passionate cult (ahem, sorry, community) vibe. Yet, they may perpetuate microaggressions against larger-bodied people in fitness spaces, and often feature little diversity in terms of their instructors’ body sizes or racial backgrounds beyond the stereotypical thin, white instructor (or receive backlash when they do).
Even bouldering, one of the latest exercise trends, isn’t immune: While it’s oriented towards strength-building rather than achieving body goals, one climbing community survey indicated that over 50 percent of respondents feel like they’re pressured to have a certain body type because of their hobby.
So, while perhaps a step in the right direction, the undertone of these subcultures promote templatized ideals, inevitably excluding those not within their purview.
***
“Vanessa, what’s wrong with climbing,” you might huff, “or wanting to lose weight or fat for ‘health’ benefits? Don’t you care about health?”
I’m not saying you can’t climb, and I’m not here to argue about health (though, you can read about the racist roots of the BMI, how lower weight doesn’t necessarily equate to greater health, or on how weight stigma itself leads to poorer physical and mental health outcomes, regardless of BMI).
To put it simply, I support body autonomy. I try to eat intuitively, engage in gentle nutrition, and move my body in ways that I enjoy. But each of us should have the prerogative to lead life how we want to — whether you want to pursue fat loss or never hit 3k steps on your Apple Watch.
I just want us to probe how much we actually support overall well-being, and not just certain body ideals. Like when we praise Mindy Kaling and Rebel Wilson for their noticeable weight loss and their reported consequent happiness about it — but body-shame singer Sam Smith for gaining weight, even when they finally feel “comfortable in their skin” after doing so.
***
Now, you might add: “But Vanessa, haven’t I seen you post barbell squats on your BeReal?”
My answer? I enjoy how badass it makes me feel, especially as part of a community of  young women online that focuses on becoming stronger and shares their realistic, beautiful, day-to-day bodies. I’ve come to appreciate the nuances of tending to both my physical and mental health, giving myself grace when I prefer rest over movement.
And indeed, studies have shown that strength training correlates with positive body image and a sense of empowerment. But that only seems true if we exercise without focusing on some appearance to achieve — a conditional I still struggle with sometimes.
I have written about body image, time and again: a high-school classmate cried after reading one such essay in 2017, and a hundred-plus people liked a post about my resolution to recover in 2020 — on Facebook, of all places. But even though I received private messages of empathy, it didn’t feel like anyone I knew was actively rejecting diet culture. I felt, and still feel, lonely.
To be fair, our generation rallies around public figures defying beauty standards: from iconic singer-songwriter Lizzo to Yumi Nu, the first Asian plus-size cover model for Sports Illustrated’s Swimsuit Issue. We increasingly voice the dangers of body trends, from buccal fat removal to the shortage of diabetes medication in the U.S. after influencers (and Elon Musk) promoted it as a quick weight-loss solution.
But still, we aren’t immune to the online barrage of body standards (Google any sort of stat on social media and correlations with poor body image).
TLDR: Mental health in the face of mainstream trends is Hard™. Here are three confessions, as an example.
1. I sometimes wish I looked like the other east Asian girls strolling around campus.
2. I tried to become an ECHO counselor during the pandemic but emotionally couldn’t handle the interview.
3. It was very mentally taxing to write this piece.
It’s hard to feel like I don’t always embody the values I claim to hold. But I find solace in the courage of others: like the inclusive BodCon community, or those like Stephanie Buttermore (who has one million-plus YouTube subscribers) that are candid about diet culture and fitness.
Research has shown that we are less hypocritical when amongst those of an in-group that we belong to. So come join this in-group, if you so choose! It’s quite liberating here.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Intellectual diversity and academic freedom have long been crucial tenets of education. But these ideals are under attack in Florida — a development that should worry us all.
On the first day of Black History Month, the College Board announced it was altering the curriculum for its Advanced Placement course in African American Studies after Florida’s Department of Education rejected the course days earlier, arguing it violated Florida law and “lack[ed] educational value.” Seemingly succumbing to the department’s demands to come “into compliance,” the College Board stripped away and minimized many scholars and subjects central to Blackness in the United States, from Black feminism to Black Lives Matter.
This dispute is the latest ideological swing against education in Florida. As the state plans to overhaul its higher education system by eliminating diversity and equity programs, Florida teachers are hiding their classroom books to avoid felony charges for controversial material.
What constitutes “compliance” with these increasingly draconian laws in Florida is unclear. One thing is clear, though: Many conservatives are loving it.
At the helm of this effort is the culture warrior Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who appears to be throwing the Republican base red meat before a rumored 2024 presidential bid. Indeed, the subjects cut from the AP African American Studies curriculum read like a laundry list of Republican complaints about “wokeness” in education. Riding a dominant re-election win, DeSantis declared in his victory speech, “Florida is where woke goes to die.”
In some ways, this is nothing new. Conservatism in the United States has long had a strain of anti-intellectualism. In the 1970s, conservative leaders like Paul Weyrich steered the Republican Party to the right, targeting movements prevalent in academic circles, like civil rights. The resulting New Right movement would carry Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump to the White House. Today, driven by conspiratorial fears and a denigration of the pursuit of knowledge, many conservatives reject what they perceive as “out-of-touch” social elites and the academic institutions they occupy.
I am the first to admit that elitism exerts itself in tangible ways here at Harvard and, undoubtedly, at many prestigious institutions of higher learning. But the recent push from DeSantis — a graduate of Harvard Law School himself — distorts and places undue blame on academic institutions for infecting young people with “woke” ideologies.
And now, anti-intellectualism is the letter of the law in the state of Florida. This should set off alarm bells for anyone who cares about academic freedom.
Schools and universities have a longstanding tradition of fostering curiosity by promoting intellectual diversity. This tradition is a cornerstone of academic freedom and an essential component of a well-rounded education. Courses like African American Studies bring new insights to our understanding of the world, allowing students to explore its complexities, challenge conventional wisdom, and form their own opinions. Politically motivated efforts to threaten this vital tradition should disturb all Americans, regardless of viewpoint.
When DeSantis appoints a blatantly partisan board of trustees at the New College of Florida and calls on teachers to clear books from classroom shelves, everyone should pay attention. This rogue movement is not only a blatant attempt to impose a singularly conservative agenda on education but also a threat to the very essence of what makes education meaningful.
At Harvard, we have a long history of trying to foster intellectual diversity and promote academic freedom. And however uneasy the development, I genuinely believe in upholding these principles.
So let’s be clear. It’s one thing to support robust academic free speech. It’s another to reject legitimate history because you disagree with it.
Consider DeSantis’ tirade against a proposed AP African American Studies section on Queer Theory.
“Who would say that an important part of Black history is Queer Theory?” DeSantis asked.
Students who have learned the likes of bell hooks, Marsha P. Johnson, and James A. Baldwin should scoff at his statement.
Ironically, DeSantis is applying the exact kind of pressure he claims he wants to eliminate — a sort of intimidation aimed at coercing educational institutions to conform to particular ideologies. Instead of allowing students the choice to take the course as initially designed, the state hides behind upholding the values of “Western civilization” — at the expense of Black literature.
Black history is American history, even the parts that conservatives find unpalatable. Purging Black scholars and salient racial topics like Black Lives Matter is a direct assault on academic free speech and intellectual freedom throughout the United States. Unfortunately, the College Board seems to have allowed DeSantis to do so.
While this crusade belongs to Governor DeSantis and his allies, we would all be wise to renew our commitment to academic freedom. Even at Harvard, it’s simply too easy to avoid and even eschew uncomfortable views. But there is immense value in exposing students to varied perspectives, including those on the right.
I grew up in the South. While joining people for school and church, I was frequently exposed to conservative ideas with which I disagreed. I still vehemently oppose the tenets of conservatism; nonetheless, because of that exposure, I saw my peers as people first, not their ideas.
Only by committing ourselves to the principles of intellectual freedom can we promote a more informed, diverse, and inclusive understanding of the world and its complexities. It is our responsibility to protect the legacy of intellectual diversity at Harvard and in higher education as a whole. So when it comes to what’s happening in Florida, we must stop the purge. But we shouldn’t stop there. Let’s cultivate a rich, intellectual environment anywhere we can.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following heavy criticism from Florida Governor Ron DeSantis — a polarizing figure who once declared that his state was where “woke goes to die” — the College Board released an updated official curriculum for its new Advanced Placement course in African American Studies.
Governor DeSantis, who graduated from Harvard Law School in 2005, announced that he would ban the original curriculum after Florida state education officials described it as historically inaccurate and in violation of Florida’s “Stop WOKE Act.”
In the updated version, the works of seminal Black writers such as Kimberlé Crenshaw, Ta-Nehisi Coates, and bell hooks have been expunged from reading lists; contemporary movements like Black Lives Matter have been erased from official discussions; and topics such as intersectionality have been downgraded to the point of being nearly unrecognizable.
Unfortunately, this embattled AP course is just the tip of the iceberg. Governor DeSantis’s decision is one in a series of his ongoing efforts in Florida to eliminate so-called “ideological conformity” by culling diversity and equity programs from public colleges, appointing six new trustees (who, shockingly, conform to the same political ideology) in an attempt to restructure the New College of Florida, and restricting access to books on race in favor of a core curriculum celebrating “Western civilization.”
Given this context, DeSantis’s campaign against AP African American Studies is nothing less than a blatant attack on Black studies and academic freedom writ large, setting a dangerous precedent for curriculums around the nation.
Crucially, believing that students should learn about a certain perspective does not entail agreeing with that perspective. In our view, if you disagree with a perspective, it is certainly better to present and critique it rather than attempt to silence it altogether — a fundamental premise of free discourse and intellectual discovery that DeSantis fails to grasp.
Indeed, such not-so-subtle attempts at restricting discourse on race may pressure non-partisan institutions like the College Board to censor important legitimate intellectual perspectives out of fear of controversy. Given that many may view these institutions as neutral arbiters and hold their academic judgment in high regard, any appearance of capitulation to political pressure at the expense of intellectual discovery creates a chilling effect for Black studies nationwide.
Contrary to the explicit devaluation of African American studies by the Florida Department of Education (and its further suffocation by the College Board’s acquiescence), we want to affirm in the strongest terms: Black history is American history, and Black studies span a broad range of experiences, perspectives, and theories that each hold untold value — and are crucial to enrich and challenge our understanding of the world.
Black studies should not be restricted to the realm of higher education. Students should be exposed to this theory, especially during high school. Less than ten percent of class time in K-12 US history classes is spent studying Black history, leaving limited reliable alternatives for most students interested in perspectives beyond those that tend to dominate most historical narratives.
By the same token, it’s no coincidence that some of the authors purged from the curriculum, such as Angela Davis, spent their careers calling out white supremacist, capitalist, and patriarchal systems of oppression in the United States.
Even if the curricular changes were made for the pedagogical reason of prioritizing primary sources over secondhand analysis, as the College Board claims, this approach is fallacious. If AP classes are intended to mirror the rigor of a college level course, then an African American Studies course that lacks theoretical sources falls short of its Advanced Placement status. Black scholars, including Harvard professors Eveyln Brooks Higginbotham and Henry Louis “Skip” Gates Jr., spent years advocating for and crafting the original curriculum; as such, the College Board should not have shied away from the original depth of AP African American Studies.
We might be more inclined to believe the College Board’s lofty pedagogical rhetoric if this weren’t its first time shifting an AP curriculum away from a focus on multi-ethnic studies. In 2018, the College Board changed its AP World History curriculum to begin in the year 1200 CE, slimming what was once a comprehensive study of the globe into a version with a Eurocentric perspective. Such moves further disincentivize students of color from taking AP courses, which act as critical stepping stones to higher education for marginalized groups.
We commend the Harvard faculty members who have spoken out against these changes and urge Harvard to do its part in the fight to protect academic freedom from attacks of the DeSantis variety by finally establishing an Ethnic Studies department — a response that is made only more necessary by the looming potential loss of affirmative action. Renewed institutional support for Ethnic and Black studies will not only offer students an opportunity to engage in discourse that may be suppressed in high schools but also encourage support for these embattled fields in American education at large.
As legal restrictions on what constitutes ‘valid’ historical knowledge multiply, and books continue to disappear from Florida educators’ shelves, the stakes are abundantly clear: Harvard has no time to lose.

Ernesto Bertarelli, an entrepreneur and philanthropist from Switzerland, will gift $75 million to Harvard Medical School through his family foundation, according to a Monday press release.
Harvard will name Building C – the last unnamed building in the Medical School – the Bertarelli Building. Bertarelli’s gift marks the second large donation that HMS has received this year, adding to the $50 million donation establishing the Paul Farmer Collaborative last month.
Bertarelli earned an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1993, and he is currently the chair of the HMS Board of Fellows, which serves as an external advisory body to the school’s leaders. He was an executive of the biotech company Serono, maker of the multiple sclerosis drug Rebif. Currently, he serves as the chairman of the private investment firm B-FLEXION.
Bertarelli called HMS a “world leader” in terms of innovation and research in the press release.
“It has been my honor to have been a partner of the School for over two decades, and I am delighted to continue to support the HMS community in its important work by helping to modernize these landmark facilities to keep pace with therapeutics innovation,” Bertarelli said in the release.
Bertarelli’s foundation has made multiple donations to the University in recent decades, helping to establish a Medical School program and a professorship in translational medicine. His sister Dona Bertarelli, co-founder of the Bertarelli Foundation, gifted $15 million in 2019 towards rare cancers research at HMS.
HMS Dean George Q. Daley ’82 called Bertarelli an “ardent supporter” of the research conducted at the Longwood campus in the press release.
“He understands that in order to improve the health and well-being of patients, we must first support observations in the lab and then nurture and orient them toward interventions in the clinic,” Daley said. “It is therefore fitting that the Bertarelli name will be inscribed in the marble of the building that personifies our commitment to both basic and therapeutic science.”
The donation will kickstart the plan to convert the outdoor courtyard in Building C to an open and skylit atrium. Construction is set to begin this year and finish in 2025.
Building C currently houses two departments and serves as the center of the HMS Therapeutics Initiative, which was created to establish a pipeline for therapeutic development, from medicine discovery to regulatory approval.
“I am honored that the Bertarelli name will become a permanent and prominent part of the Medical School’s quadrangle,” University President Lawrence S. Bacow said in the press release.

The Harvard Kennedy School appointed former Republican Secretary for the Majority Laura C. Dove as second-in-command of the Institute of Politics, the IOP announced in a press release Monday.
Dove will serve as the IOP’s first senior director of administration for the next six months under Interim Director Setti D. Warren “to oversee all aspects of IOP programming and operations” while the search for a new director continues. The search for the next IOP director — which began in August after the unexpected departure of Mark D. Gearan ’78 — is expected to conclude this semester.
Warren has served as interim director since Gearan’s departure and said in a November interview that he is vying for the permanent director role. Though Warren’s former position as executive director of the IOP remains unfilled, Dove will take on many of his previous responsibilities in her newly-created role.
“She brings extraordinary experience from Capitol Hill, a wealth of knowledge about Republican politics and policymaking, and a deep commitment to our students to inspire them to live in public service,” Warren said in a press release.
Dove was elected by the U.S. Senate Republican Conference as secretary for the minority in 2013 and secretary for the majority in 2015. Dove retired from her role as secretary in 2020, in a move announced by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
“She is a keen strategist who always thinks several steps ahead. She has not just been one of my own closest advisers, but a key resource to our entire majority and a central part of its many accomplishments,” McConnell said of Dove in a February 2020 press release. “Senators and staff on both sides of the aisle will miss Laura a lot and I will be foremost among them.”
Dove began her Senate career in the 1980s as a page, then served as an assistant in the Senate Republican Cloakroom.
After retiring from the Senate, Dove served as federal affairs director of Ford Motor Company for two years, then served on the board of directors of Perpetua Resources, a gold mine site redevelopment company.
Dove served as a Pritzker Fellow at the University of Chicago’s Institute of Politics in the fall of 2022, where she led a seminar on bipartisanship and the importance of the Senate.
“Laura’s leadership will help the IOP continue to be a thought leader on the critical issues facing young Americans and our country and to be one of the country’s premier arenas for political speech, discussion, and debate across the political aisle,” Warren said.
Correction: February 13, 2023
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Laura C. Dove would serve as the IOP’s senior director of administration for six weeks. In fact, Dove will serve in the role for six months.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard public health experts discussed the effect of climate change on health care, as well as health care’s carbon footprint, in a panel at Harvard Law School’s Petrie-Flom Center on Friday.
The event was moderated by Alicia Ely Yamin, a Law School lecturer and the senior fellow on global health and rights at the Petrie-Flom Center, a program that researches biotechnology, bioethics, and health law policy.
Friday’s panelists discussed both climate change’s impact on healthcare and how the health care system contributes to climate change.
Aaron Bernstein, interim director of the Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment at the Harvard School of Public Health, said climate change serves as a “risk amplifier.” He added that climate change intensifies extreme weather events and risks on health care providers’ ability to provide care, citing the challenges of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans and the wildfires in California as examples.
“I want to underscore that climate change is not creating new disasters. It’s not creating new burdens of disease. It’s not inventing power outages that make it harder to do our jobs. It is magnifying these things.” Bernstein said.
Bernstein added that the health care sector has been “remarkably timid” at advocating that policymakers and corporations address issues of health equity, which are exacerbated by climate change.
“I would say unmitigated climate change is an enormously detrimental force upon the ability of health care systems to do work productively, writ large,” he said. “And I think the absence of that understanding is perhaps getting in the way of more advocacy from healthcare to address this issue more broadly.”
Still, Anand Bhopal, a fellow in the School of Public Health’s Takemi Program in International Health, said the health sector also contributes to climate change. According to Bhopal, the sector accounts for about 5 percent of global carbon-dioxide emissions — more than the pollution of flying and shipping industries. Health care in richer countries, he added, emits the most carbon dioxide.
Bhopal said he is particularly interested in how citizens can push policymakers to implement sustainability in health care systems. But such changes in health care, he said, may not come easily.
“I think it’s fairly clear that health systems already have a huge number of competing concerns. This is worsened by Covid-19. But of course we need to try and address healthcare needs. We need to do that equitably. We need to address staff burnout. The list goes on,” Bhopal said. “And the question is: Where does sustainability and cutting heart care’s carbon footprint fit into this?”
Beyond policy, the supply chain also accounts for 70 to 80 percent of health care’s carbon footprint, according to Bernstein. The health sector depends on pharmaceuticals and single-use plastics, he said, which require fossil fuels to produce.
“We have a real challenge here in technology, which I think we need to be mindful of as we advocate for decarbonization,” Bernstein said. “Everything in health care is plastic. So we can want to decarbonize health care, but the lion’s share of health care is in resources for which we right now have very few alternatives.”
Despite this, Bernstein said he is “very encouraged” by the recent signs of communication between providers and manufacturers, which have previously been “rarely that transparent.”
Bhopal advocated for treating sustainable health care as a “distinct legal concern.”
“It’s saying it’s not really a competition between health and the climate,” Bhopal said. “It’s that we have a commitment to deliver health in a low-carbon, climate-protecting way.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An interdisciplinary panel of Harvard affiliates discussed the ethics of possessing human remains for research, education, or exhibition in University collections during a Harvard Medical School Center for Bioethics webinar on Thursday.
The event — moderated by Robert D. Truog, the director of the HMS Center for Bioethics — is the third installment of annual Black History Month seminars hosted by the HMS Center for Bioethics and the National Center for Bioethics Research and Health Care at Tuskegee University. Speakers discussed the University’s archival research efforts and the development of academic curricula with ancestral remains.
The panelists included HMS professor Scott H. Podolsky ’93, Peabody Museum Director Jane Pickering, Warren Anatomical Museum and Countway Library of Medicine curator Dominic W. Hall, and History professor Philip J. Deloria. Evelynn M. Hammonds, the chair of the Steering Committee on Human Remains in University Museum Collections, also participated in the discussion.
During the event, Deloria highlighted the importance of examining Harvard as the “possessors of human remains.”
“We’re not responsible for this, but we are responsible to it,” he said. “So in some ways the reason we do this is for us as an institution to make amends and make repairs.”
The discussion served as a reflective forum in response to a September 2022 report released by the Steering Committee, which offered recommendations on ethically returning the remains of enslaved individuals of African descent and those of other ethnic origins.
The report comes nearly two years after the University faced accusations of violating the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act. The University has since launched a widespread repatriation campaign to return various body parts and cultural artifacts kept in Harvard repositories and collections, especially those held in the Peabody Museum.
“I think where I really see where NAGPRA can help inform moving forward with other remains is through what people have learned from tribes about treatment, about what matters to them,” Pickering said.
The Steering Committee was formed after a review by the Peabody Museum revealed it held the human remains of 15 people of African descent who were likely enslaved. Since the January 2021 report detailing these findings, the committe found remains of four additional people of Brazilian and Caribbean origin — who were identified as likely also enslaved. The committee is now tasked with developing a University policy on museum stewardship practices, as well as helping museum staff connect with affected cultural groups.
Pickering discussed the implications of ethical stewardship for an anthropology museum and addressed Harvard’s fraught history with ancestral remains.
“As someone who’s really charged to not only think about these issues but also act, it was very powerful to have the expertise and thinking of a really incredible group of people,” Pickering said.
During the event, Hammond urged Harvard to establish a Human Remains Research Review Committee to engage with museum staff members on evaluating requests by Harvard and external scholars to use human remains for research.
Hall said an important question is to ask if the knowledge gleaned from researching the human remains is “worth it.”
“One of the things that happens when you do that research is you create new knowledge that you then have to store, curate, and steward and possibly protect,” Hall said. “So you really have to ask yourself that hard question — what is the purpose of generating this new information?”
In response to a question about the role of doing genetic sequencing on remains, Hammond said she was “not convinced” by the claims for further research, adding that the process demonstrated these individuals were still viewed as “as objects to be studied.”
The committee is also working towards developing a University-wide policy on the collection and display of human remains in addition to establishing a framework of principles and practices to connect with affected cultural groups during repatriation and memorialization measures.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 70 Harvard students protested Harvard’s continued employment of professor John L. Comaroff, who is under fire for allegations of sexual harassment, and called for reform of the University’s sexual misconduct policies at a Friday afternoon rally.
Undergraduate and graduate students gathered in front of the Science Center before marching through Harvard Yard, chanting “Hey Hey, Ho Ho, Comaroff Has Got to Go” and “No More Comaroff, No More Complicity” as students and tourists looked on.
The march ended in front of University Hall, where undergraduate organizers from the anti-rape culture advocacy group Our Harvard Can Do Better draped a red sheet over the John Harvard Statue and raised a “Shame on Harvard” banner on two University Hall flagpoles.
The protest is the latest in a flurry of student activism around Comaroff, whom the Faculty of Arts and Sciences placed on one semester of unpaid leave in spring 2022 after Harvard found his verbal conduct violated sexual harassment and professional retaliation policies.
The African and African-American Studies and Anthropology professor is also at the center of a lawsuit against Harvard first filed one year ago by three female Anthropology graduate students who allege the school failed to respond to years of harassment and retaliation allegations against Comaroff. His lawyers have denied all allegations.
Comaroff returned to the classroom in the fall 2022 semester to teach a non-required course, sparking student outrage and protest in September 2022. Last month, more than 100 students walked out of Comaroff’s first class of the spring 2023 semester, making national headlines. Over the following days, hundreds of people emailed top Harvard administrators demanding the professor be fired.
Both of Comaroff’s spring classes now have zero enrolled students, per the FAS registrar’s office.
Following Friday’s march, seven speakers addressed the crowd gathered at University Hall.
“Harvard is a role model for all other institutions nationwide and worldwide and has a unique role in changing culture around sexual assault everywhere,” said Saba Mehrzad ’25, a Crimson magazine editor, in a speech at the protest. “Our Harvard needs to stop protecting predators and start protecting its students.”
Margaret G. Czerwienski and Lilia M. Kilburn — two of the three plaintiffs in the 2022 suit against Harvard — spoke to the crowd of supporters at the rally.
In her speech, Kilburn told the crowd to avoid “hero worship.”
“Don’t let professors be your heroes. Don’t let survivors be your heroes. We’re not heroes. We’re TFs,” Kilburn said. “We don’t have some kind of superhuman capacity to take this fight on. We are doing it anyway.”
Czerwienski said that “only a mass movement” would effectively dismantle “this broken system.”
Allegations against Comaroff were first published in The Crimson in 2020, following an eight-month investigation which found that at least three Anthropology graduate students had contacted Harvard’s Title IX Office with sexual harassment and professional retaliation complaints against the professor.
Following The Crimson’s reporting, FAS Dean and University President-elect Claudine Gay placed Comaroff on paid administrative leave in August 2020, then placed him on unpaid leave for one semester last spring.
The three Anthropology graduate students who are suing Harvard — Czerwienski, Kilburn, and Amulya Mandava — filed an amended lawsuit in June 2022 detailing new allegations of sexual harassment from Comaroff’s tenure at the University of Chicago, claiming Harvard failed to respond to warnings about the professor’s behavior before hiring him.
“I wanted to come out here and support the students, I think they’re standing up for something that’s really, really important,” Czerwienski said in an interview following the protest.
“This is the last thing that we ever wanted to do with our time in graduate school. As you can see in our lawsuit, Harvard pushes the risk of resolving these situations onto individual students again and again rather than taking on that risk themselves,” Kilburn said in an interview. “We were exposed to incredible amounts of retaliation, not only from Harvard faculty, but faculty across the world.”
In a statement, Comaroff’s attorneys Janet E. Halley, Ruth K. O’Meara-Costello ’02, and Norman S. Zalkind denied claims that the professor was a sexual abuser or harasser and said that while the anonymous allegations in the lawsuit were “difficult to respond to precisely because they are anonymous, they bear no resemblance to reality.”
They objected to calls to fire Comaroff, saying that the Harvard investigations only found the professor guilty of one incident of verbal harassment and “largely exonerated” the professor.
“Protesters are choosing to rely on innuendo and misinformation rather than seeking actual facts,” they wrote. “Professor Comaroff has never done anything, ever, to retaliate against or harm a student.”
Our Harvard Can Do Better organizer Rachael A. Dziaba ’26, who spoke at Friday’s rally, said Comaroff was “one symptom of a larger disease.”
“It’s important to remember that getting rid of Comaroff is not the same as ending Harvard's complicity, and that we are looking for real changes in this institution,” Dziaba said in an interview following the protest.
Rosalie P. Couture ’26, another organizer for Our Harvard Can Do Better, said in an interview she hopes Harvard administrators understand that the protesters will “keep on being a pain in their ass.”
She called for increased transparency in sexual misconduct investigations and the creation of an independent rape crisis center on campus.
“We need an entire overhaul of how our Title IX office works and how we give justice for survivors,” Couture said.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana stood a few feet behind the crowd for a portion of the protest. He declined to comment for this article.
FAS spokesperson Rachael Dane and University spokesperson Jason A. Newton also declined to comment.
Our Harvard Can Do Better organizer Annabelle J.L. Finlayson ’23, a Crimson Editorial editor, called the University’s silence in response to student protests “embarrassing” and “an admission of guilt.”
“I’m sure they’re hoping it’ll blow over, and we promise it’s not going to,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Confronting record-breaking low temperatures earlier this month, some of Cambridge’s unhoused residents sought refuge in shelters offering extended hours last weekend, while others faced the cold.
Harvard’s two student-run homeless shelters, Y2Y Harvard Square and Harvard Square Homeless Shelter, opened during the day in addition to their regular overnight hours.
Y2Y Volunteer Director and Tufts junior Annie S. Li sent out an email calling for emergency volunteers during the cold snap, asking anyone interested to sign up for extra shifts during the day. Y2Y operates on a peer-to-peer model, where volunteers aged 18 to 24 — many of whom are Harvard students — serve guests of similar age.
“The extreme weather puts our guests in danger because Y2Y normally operates as an overnight shelter,” Li wrote. “As a result, in order to provide a safe and warm space for the guests, we will be opening the whole day Saturday, Feb. 3.”
“We actually did not know how many people we’re going to expect, which is really surprising that we were able to get more than enough volunteers who were willing to come in,” she said in an interview last week.
John U. Ficek ’25 — one of the emergency volunteers at Y2Y — said he was prompted to volunteer by the impending weather conditions.
“I was thinking about how it was quite literally going to be lethal temperatures that weekend. And then it just so happened an hour later after I thought to myself that an email was sent down asking for help for that day, so I was happy to help,” said Ficek.
Despite the cold, Y2Y did not experience an influx of guests during last weekend, likely because the shelter stopped providing emergency beds, according to Li. She added that not many people have been entering the lottery to get a bed in the shelter this winter.
“We’re pretty surprised about it, because it’s pretty cold outside — it’s winter season,” Li said.
Mark D. Kingsbury, an unhoused person who frequents Harvard Square, said he was outside during last weekend’s record-breaking cold temperatures when a passerby called an ambulance for him.
“I was like, what? I didn’t call an ambulance, I’m okay. I mean, I was under a lot of layers,” Kingsbury said. “It was like six [degrees] — it was in the range I can still do.”
Jim Stewart, director of First Church Shelter in Cambridge, said the facility extended its open hours in response to the weather but did not see an increase in guests last weekend, adding that a “significant number” of unhoused people “don’t like to be inside.”
“We stayed open all day — we’re usually closed until four o’clock on weekdays, but we remained open,” Stewart said. “We actually didn’t get a lot of calls from people looking for shelter.”
Though First Church Shelter and Y2Y did not experience a rise in people seeking shelter over the weekend, Kingsbury says that some areas became packed due to the cold.
“Everybody went to South Station. I was told that it was pretty crazy there — it was a free-for-all,” Kingsbury said. “I was like ‘wow,’ that’s just a lot of homeless people that are just crowding into places to stay warm.”
Kingsbury added he has stayed overnight in shelters ever since arriving in the Cambridge area approximately six years ago, including during last week’s cold snap. When not in the shelter, he said he keeps warm by going to public spaces, such as the Smith Campus Center and the MBTA system.
“The transit system is definitely something to use. I remember sleeping outside, and it’d be too cold in the morning, and I would get up at five, just get on the train, and take a nap on it,” he said.
In addition to seeking shelter, many unhoused people require additional layers and winter jackets to endure prolonged periods of time outside, according to Susan Jones, an unhoused person who spends time in Harvard Square.
Jones, who stayed with a friend during the cold snap, said she acquired the majority of her winter clothing from donations to the Quaker Church on Brattle St.
“You can go there every week and get what you want — get you a few pairs of pants, shirts, coats, whatever you need,” said Jones, “So they’re very helpful.”
In addition to the Quaker Church, Jones said she also took advantage of the outreach teams from churches and multi-service centers distributing hand warmers and gloves in the greater Boston area.
Jones added she empathized with the individuals who remained outside during the cold weather, recalling one instance when she was outside following a period of heavy snow.
“Trying to even get warm — I just felt terrible for the people who were stuck out here, you know? Because I know what it’s like,” Jones said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Five pairs of candidates for the Harvard Undergraduate Association co-presidency presented their platforms and discussed club funding and changes to the body at a debate held in Sever Hall Sunday afternoon.
The debate was hosted by the Harvard Political Review and moderated by HPR editors Jacqui R. Schlesinger ’26 and Jonah B. Simon ’26. The candidates — Jonathan Berkowitz ’24 and Spencer W. Glassman ’23-’24, Zachary J. Lech ’24 and Ivan O.A. Specht ’24, Bobby F. Current ’24 and Rohan C. Shah ’24, Ethan C. Kelly ’25 and Laila A. Nasher ’25, and John S. Cooke ’25 and Shikoh M. Hirabayashi ’24 — presented their platforms and responded to questions from moderators and audience members at the event.
This month’s vote will mark the second-ever HUA presidential election, which comes after the student body voted to disband its 40-year-old student government — the Undergraduate Council — in 2022.
During the debate, each pair of candidates pledged to increase club funding, though they proposed slightly varying methodologies for doing so. The HUA received $550,000 from the Dean of Students Office for the 2022-2023 academic year, marking a 10 percent increase from funding under the UC.
Berkowitz and Glassman pledged to increase the HUA’s pool of funds by pushing the administration to extend financial aid to the student activities fee, a $200 annual charge paid by students to fund undergraduate organizations and student life.
Currently, the fee can be waived, but it is not covered by financial aid.
“We want the HUA to serve the students and not to serve itself,” Berkowitz said. “So a lot of times people come to the HUA with their own initiatives, and direct all the HUA funding towards the HUA’s own things, but what we want to do is we want to prioritize the clubs, and we want to prioritize all the students.”
Lech and Specht said they would increase the percentage of the HUA budget that is devoted to clubs, adding that they would prioritize funding groups whose events are open to the entire student body.
“We should especially prioritize minorities and, in my opinion, cultural affinity groups because well, they are far far away from home, they need a home here,” said Lech, a Crimson arts editor. “It’s important to look at things that are going to have a bigger impact on the community itself.”
Meanwhile, Kelly and Nasher promised to allocate all HUA funding to clubs. During the 2022-2023 academic year, roughly 81 percent of the HUA’s overall budget went to student organizations.
During the debate, Cooke promised to transition club funding to a week-by-week basis and institute a money-back guarantee so “all unused funds from any other HUA organizational group go directly back into the pockets of student organizations.”
Adding to his running mate’s response, Hirabayashi said the pair would allocate more HUA funds toward parties and devote “a lot of money to pest control.”
Cooke and Hirabayashi emphasized that they are the only pair of candidates that have previously served on the HUA.
“We know exactly what it’s going to take to get work done,” Cooke said. “We know exactly what the potential of this organization is, and we hope to help this organization realize its potential next year.”
Still, other candidates were critical of the student government’s first term, which drew mixed reviews from some students.
Berkowitz said he believes “transparency is a really big problem” for the HUA and proposed a website that publishes a log of the body’s spending.
“Rather than us being some ghost body that no one knows what exactly we’re doing, every Harvard student will have access to a public domain,” he said.
Nasher, who alleged last September that the HUA rejected her group’s proposal for a diversity, equity, and inclusion team — said she and Kelly would aim to improve the experience of underrepresented groups on campus.
Nasher said first-generation low-income, LGBTQ+, and female students often feel “attacked and underrepresented” on campus, and that she hopes to address these issues if elected.
“We believe a radical change is needed in addressing how matters are actually handled,” Nasher said. “However, well, there are systems in place to ensure that continued change can happen — you just need the right leadership.”
Current voiced ideas for a substantially different version of the current government, which would include more representatives.
“Ten people can’t run a task of government,” Current said. “That’s why my main thing on everything I'm running for is to recreate a legislature but one that’s different from our last one — one that’s more representative, one that has more oversight, transparency, so everyone has more of a voice.”
Voting for the HUA co-presidency is set to open on Feb. 16 and close on Feb. 18, with official campaigning to begin at 4 p.m. on Monday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 10 Harvard men’s hockey team headed north to Hanover, N.H. to take on the Dartmouth Big Green for their last Ivy League matchup of the season Friday night. The Crimson successfully brought a 6-3 win back to Cambridge, finalizing Harvard’s Ivy League record for the year at 9-1, almost perfect excluding a road loss to Brown University on January 21st. Junior forward Sean Farrell, who ranks second in the country in points per game behind Michigan’s Adam Fantilli, had a career-high five points on the night.
“It was a hard fought game. We expected as much. Dartmouth has played very well lately,” head coach Ted Donato ’91 commented. “We were able to pull away a little bit in the third and I thought there were a lot of good things, and I thought our guys were excited to be able to win a game and stay focused before the Beanpot.”
With a number of injuries piling up, the Crimson’s lineup looked slightly different than normal on Friday night. Notably missing from action was senior defenseman and captain Henry Thrun, who plays on the top defensive pair in addition to quarterbacking the team’s first power play unit. Also absent was first-year forward Casey Severo, a typical third-liner, who had yet to miss a game this season. Both were injured in last Monday’s Beanpot semifinal against the Boston College Eagles.
“I think that we're hopeful that we'll get both at the back,” Donato said. “I think that one of them will be [out] much shorter than the other.”
In place of Thrun, sophomore defenseman Christian Jimenez stepped in as the seventh defender, dressing for his fourth game of the season. Junior forward Ryan Drkulec got the look in place of Severo, taking the left wing slot of the third line along senior forward and captain Baker Shore and first-year forward Marek Hejduk, the hero of Monday’s Beanpot semifinals.
Out of the gate, advantage went to the Crimson, as first-year forward Joe Miller was thrown into the boards by Dartmouth’s Sean Chisholm prior to Harvard’s first line change, sending the visiting team to the power play. The hi twas further reviewed to determine if it qualified for a five minute major penalty, but was confirmed to be a boarding minor. The Crimson were unable to take advantage, only putting one shot on goal in the two-minute stretch.
After dominating possession for the following five minutes, Harvard lost the puck after Dartmouth’s Joey Musa blocked sophomore defenseman Jack Bar’s shot, and Musa then dished the puck to teammate Cooper Flinton, who fed a Chisholm breakaway. Chisholm breezed past first-year defender Ryan Healey, giving himself a clear lane to take a shot on senior goaltender Mitchell Gibson. Gibson, who entered the game 4-0 in his career against the Big Green, had initial control of the puck, but lost it as it followed down his extended right leg to just barely cross the goal line, giving Dartmouth the 1-0 lead.
It didn’t take long for Harvard to add one of their own in response. Just over a minute later, Drkulec took advantage of dressing for just his fourth game this season, notching his second goal of the campaign. Assisted by linemates Shore and Hejduk, Drkulec’s tally continued the recent trend of the third and fourth lines contributing points at pivotal moments, following Hejduk’s big Beanpot performance.
The remainder of the period provided chances for both teams, though Harvard outshot the Big Green nine to four. The closest the Crimson came to finding the twine was an opportunity for Miller beautifully set up by Coronato with eight minutes left in the period, with Farrell waiting on the doorstep for the rebound. However, Dartmouth goalkeeper Cooper Black denied Miller and subsequently cleared the puck, neutralizing the opportunity.
The second period was defined by penalties. In total, there were six power play opportunities, four for the Crimson and two for Big Green, with only one repeat offender spending time in the box (Dartmouth defender Tanner Palocisk, first for slashing and later tripping). The first three penalties of the period went in favor of Harvard. Failing to capitalize on the first, the Crimson found themselves back on the man advantage not a minute after returning to even strength play. Harvard was buzzing on their second power play, putting up 11 shots, six on goal, before junior forward Alex Laferriere finally broke through Black, scoring at 6:37 into the second. Nabbing the assists were sophomore defenseman Ian Moore and Farrell.
The Crimson was tamed on its third consecutive power play opportunity, again only recording one shot during the stretch. Harvard went to the penalty kill not two minutes later, with Hejduk spending time in the box for tripping. The Big Green capitalized on its first advantage of the night, with forward Braiden Dorfman recording the goal after a deflection off of Gibson’s glove.
Following Dartmouth’s tying goal, the Crimson found its rhythm again, regaining the edge in play. After a series of strong chances off the rush, Laferriere took a stick to the skates, sending Harvard once again to the power play. Maintaining an aggressive mentality on the man advantage, the Crimson kept the shots coming, and not a minute into the penalty, senior forward and captain John Farinacci got a second look at a Laferriere rebound, burying the chance and giving Harvard a 3-2 lead.
“The power play scoring two goals was huge. It needs to be a weapon for us and keep teams from hooking and holding, make them pay for it when they do,” said Donato regarding the power play’s success. “I think the two powerplay goals were very big for us.”
The remaining five minutes of the period included a successful penalty kill by the Crimson, including a short-handed Laferriere breakaway that was denied by Black at point-blank range.
“We were playing well five-on-five. We were able to get those two power play goals at good times,” Farrell said. “We were pretty happy with where we were in the second and knew we just had to keep doing the same thing.”
Harvard wasted no time adding to its lead in the third. Just over a minute into the period, Miller sent a rocket over the left blocker of Black after a beautiful dime by Farrell found him at the point. However, the Big Green responded shortly thereafter with a power play goal after Hejduk was called for interference. After Shore lost the faceoff to Chisholm following the penalty, Dartmouth forward Luke Haymes sent his own bullet over Gibson's right shoulder, cutting the Big Green deficit to one..
“The two [Dartmouth power play] goals kept them in the game,” Donato mentioned. “[The penalty kill is] something that will look to improve.”
Following the tally, Harvard regrouped, putting together another aggressive offensive drive. Putting up nine shots in two and a half minutes, the Crimson forced Big Green head coach Reid Cashman to use his timeout to give his players a breather. However, the break proved to work in Harvard’s favor rather than Dartmouth's.. The dynamic duo of Coronato and Farrell combined for another goal shortly after the timeout, as Coronato set up Farrell for a great finish.
Possession continued to be controlled by the Crimson, and the Big Green pulled Black for the additional attacker with just over three minutes remaining in the game. Though Gibson and the defense faced a sequence of six consecutive shots, Farrell picked up a blocked pass and found the empty net, securing the 6-3 victory while also recording his career-high fifth point of the night.
“I'm just trying to find the best play available and get it to whoever’s open. I play with really good linemates and on a really good power play,” Farrell emphasized. “Those guys find me in the right places too.”
“He's relentless on the puck. He's played a lot of the year with Matt Coronato – together they turn the puck over and they stay on pucks,” Donato said. “Sean is a gifted offensive player and he can both beat you with his shot and he can beat you with deception and passing skills. It's been fun to watch it. Obviously, it's been a huge part of our success.”
Looking forward, Harvard will face the No. 20/17 Northeastern Huskies in the Championship Game of the Beanpot Tournament on  Monday at 7:30pm at T.D. Garden. The Northeastern/Harvard matchup is the first time in the tournament’s 70 year history that the two have faced each other in the Championship, where the Crimson will play for the 12th Beanpot title in program history and its first trophy since 2017.
“It's a dream of every young hockey player in Massachusetts growing up,” Farrell said.  “It was amazing for me to experience it last Monday and playing in the championship this Monday is going to be really special and we're all really excited.”
The Huskies advanced from the semifinal last week after beating the favored No. 3 Boston University Terriers behind an outstanding performance from goalie Devon Levi, who stopped 32 of 33 shots on goal. Levi ranks third in the country with a .930 save percentage.
However, Harvard posted eight goals against Levi in the teams’ regular season matchup on New Year’s Day, with six different Crimson players scoring in the 8-4 win
Jiminez and Drkulec suited up for that game, and it was against Northeastern that Drkulec scored his first of the season. With the status of Thrun and Severo unknown, it is possible that both Jiminez and Drkulec could dress on Monday.
Also out of the lineup for the previous matchup was Farinacci, as he was still recovering from the upper-body injury that sidelined him for the first half of the season. Since his return, the Arizona Coyotes prospect has reclaimed his spot as one of Harvard’s best forwards, recording nine points in as many games, as well as being the strongest faceoff man for the Crimson.
“It's just an exciting opportunity, in a lot of ways. You think you play in the Beanpot, but until you get to play in the championship game you don’t really fully understand its meaning and the opportunity that's there,” Donato added. “I'm happy for our guys that we were able to get there and now we're focused on trying to bring our best game on Monday night to try to have success.”

Maybe your bestie lives 3,000 miles away in Cali. Maybe your sneaky link transferred to the Quad. Either way, the distance between you doesn’t have to tear your friendship apart. Here are some tips to help distance make the heart grow fonder.
Live life on the edge: be spontaneous!
If you and your friend haven’t talked in a while, and you’re waiting for permission to text them, here it is. Go, text them, I’ll wait. At the end of the day, someone has to reach out first; why can’t it be you?
If you and your friend text more often than you sleep: Break the mold, and text your friend just because you can! Message them when you see something random that reminds you of them, when you’re sad, when you’re hungry. The best time is any time you choose.
Lean into the memes.
You don’t even need words for this one. Why spend hours obsessing over the intricacies of “how r u” versus “how are you?” versus “what’s up?” when you could just shoot your faraway friend a lovingly chosen TikTok and call it a day? Funny videos are your completely free ticket to instant connection. After all, laughter’s the best medicine — why wouldn’t it mend the wounds of distance?
Leverage the (mild) emotional blackmail.
Send them an “I miss you” every once in a while. It may be a tad bit manipulative, but, hey, it’s the truth.
Channel Jane Austen: live that period piece.
In the whirlwind of 10-hour psets and 300-page readings, your schedules may not always line up. But staying in touch doesn’t have to get left on the wayside with some inspiration from days of yore. Write your friend a letter (by text) and let them take a day (or a week) to respond; your friendship isn't worth any less because it’s less immediate.
Plan a vacay (or brunch).
Spring break’s only a few weeks away, and summer’s just a few more weeks after that. Planning a hangout far in advance can itself be a vacation from stress, and it will give you and your friend something to look forward to until you see each other again.
Pop the Harvard bubble: bring in the college talk.
If your friend goes to another university, ask them about it! (The food’s probably better. They will be smug about it.) Academic angst is a universal experience, so make liberal use of it when you’re not sure what else to say.
Move your fun to the big small screen.
Covid-era schooling and socializing was a trial by fire, but at least now you have an arsenal of virtual entertainment. You can spend a night watching movies over FaceTime or Netflix Parties. Or, if you’re too intellectual for that, you can play online board games. Find those virtual niches to make the distance feel that much smaller.
Put them in the GCal.
Long-distance friendships are sometimes easier to maintain when they’re woven into your routine — and color-coded on your GCal — allowing your far-flung friend to stay as much a part of your life as your dhall meal buddies. Scheduled reminders to send a message your friend’s way can help you remember to stay in touch even during busy periods like midterm season (even if that’s every week) and finals week. With the help of a miracle or two, you and your bestie might also be able to align your schedules to talk (over the phone) for an afternoon in the near future.
Remind them that you love them.
It means a lot. I promise.
The key to keeping your spirits up in a long-distance friendship is remembering that it’s okay to give your friend some space. Life gets busy, time grows short, and staying in touch may feel harder than it seems it should. And that’s okay. As long as you keep on picking up the phone, keep on making an effort to stay in touch, your friendship will remain intact and thriving.

Forget Valentine’s Day—Galentine’s is the real, notable, love-related ‘holiday’ in February. Flyby’s got you and your (single) besties covered this year, with ideas on how you all can spend the evening. From playing squash to hosting a cook-off and watching rom-coms all night, this year’s Galentine’s will be full of laughter and fun, and definitely no Valentine’s Day fomo (finger’s crossed on that last one).
Treat yourselves to a ~fancy~ dinner
Hop on the T and head to the North End for some overpriced yummy pasta and lots of cheesy garlic bread. Why not head over to one of the cute late-night bakeries for a tiramisu or cannoli for dessert? Spare no expense or calories tonight. Beware of the couples — the place may be crawling with them.
Play squash
Being single on Valentine’s day got you down? Flyby has the answer for you. Gather up all your besties and head to the nearest squash court (i.e. QRAC or Murr Center). Get all that pent-up, “No, no Valentine’s Day date plans this year” anger out. There’s nothing quite like thwacking a bouncy ball against four walls with a racket to soothe the soul and heart. Don’t know the rules of squash? Who cares? Make them up. Everything goes on Galentine’s Day.
Put together your own ~fancy~ dinner
It’s time to make use of your floor’s common kitchens. Head to Trader Joe’s or Star Market (for all you Quadlings) and grab some frozen dumplings, sushi, and anything else that speaks to you. It also goes without saying that you and your besties will need a couple of pints of Ben and Jerry’s to round off your culinary experience.
Host a cook-off 
If you are feeling adventurous, you and your besties can each make/put together some sort of food dish that everyone has to try and judge. Don’t know how to cook? Even better. The dish can be as simple or as intricate as you want it to be — some pasta, DIY fondue, a bowl of Marshmallow Mateys, doctored up HUDS chili — let your creativity run free.
Rom-com and drink the night away
Grab every snack you can carry from CVS, a couple bottles of white wine soda from C’est Bon and find a TV screen. Tonight’s picks should be the cringiest, pretty predictable, not-super-overplayed, most fun rom-coms ever. These may include, “The Kissing Booth 2” (this is the one where Elle visits Noah at Harvard in some parallel universe), “My Big Fat Greek Wedding,” “Serendipity,” “10 Things I Hate About You” (ok, this one is pretty popular, but it’s great). Or, feel free to return to some of the classics. What matters most is that you and your besties laugh, cringe, cry, get wine drunk, and have a great night.
Face Masks
This one is pretty self-explanatory.
Karaoke 
An actual-karaoke bar/establishment is not needed tonight — Galentine’s karaoke can happen from the comfort of your dorm room. Turn up your speaker and stack your Spotify queue with you and your friends’ favorite songs that you all know the words too. Why not come up with an interpretive dance routine? Dance and sing the night away — or until your Proctor comes and shuts you down. Whichever comes first.
The most important thing about Galentine’s is that you and your best friends laugh a lot, practice some self-care (yes, squash and cook-offs can be considered self-care) and celebrate each other. Valentines will come and go, but your Galentines could very well be around forever.
