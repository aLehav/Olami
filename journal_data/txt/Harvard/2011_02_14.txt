After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two weeks ago, off-campus, hundreds of female students met and mingled as part of the selection process for new members of Harvard’s three sororities, Delta Gamma, Kappa Alpha Theta, and Kappa Kappa Gamma. Yet, as evidenced by a Crimson Staff editorial published just last Thursday, these organizations are often overlooked, ignored, and overshadowed by an obsession with dissecting, attacking, and defeating Final Club culture. The three sororities, which are cohesive and responsible social organizations that vastly improve the college experiences for hundreds of women, deserve to be judged on their own merits and to receive more attention and support from both students and the administration. Next year, the University should encourage the expansion of the sorority system at Harvard to include a fourth sorority, allow the chapters to advertise “Rush” across campus, and allow them to reserve University space for recruitment and chapter meetings.
The Administration cannot eliminate demand for single-sex social organizations by denying them recognition and resources. Such actions merely push these groups to the margins of meaningful discussions of student life and force students to seek social fulfillment in groups that contribute to the hyper-competitive, high-strung, and manic extracurricular culture at Harvard. Comps and time spent at computers have become a prerequisite to social participation. Rather than shunning them, the administration should identify and support the groups that improve student life in an inclusive and responsible way.
Unlike the Final Clubs, which require invitations to punch, the sororities use a standardized open Rush system that allows anyone to express interest. They are also different from the male fraternities on campus, which have minimal communication and run independent recruitment efforts. In contrast, the three sororities collaborate in a highly monitored process, overseen by a Panhellenic council, in which both the sororities and the potential new members have the opportunity to express preferences and assess fit. The model is transparent and inclusive, presenting a preferable alternative to Final Club punch.
Allowing the sororities to poster and use spaces like Ticknor Lounge would allow them to maximize the number of women who know about rush, ensuring that the recruitment process is as inclusive as possible. The University’s current policy that prevents the sororities from actively advertising rush on campus hinders the sororities’ strongest asset, inclusivity in the selection process. Currently, sororities must resort to Facebook and word of mouth, which necessarily focuses recruitment energy on those underclassmen who already know members of the group.
In the face of skyrocketing interest, as sororities increase the size of their organizations to accommodate as many new members as possible, a move which will undoubtedly harm members’ experiences and group cohesion, the sororities are forced to simultaneously reject interested students. But, calls from this publication, among others, to chastise the sororities for their increasing size are ignorant and counterproductive. This is the strongest case for more sororities at Harvard: More women can be involved system-wide as each sorority equilibrates to a level of membership that maximizes group cohesion. Being forced to reject interested students is detrimental to social life at Harvard and unfair to sorority hopefuls. New sororities on campus would both allow more women to reap the benefits of membership—friendship, leadership opportunities, philanthropy, and a support system—and encourage the emergence of sororities with different personalities and cultures, increasing the chances that every student will find a good fit.
It is also critical to note that the sororities are part of national organizations that enforce a range of regulations and codes of conduct. The sororities are monitored by volunteer adult advisers and have rules that address many of the concerns that surround the Final Clubs; the sororities follow strict anti-hazing policies, have commitments to philanthropy, and expend enormous effort on risk mitigation. The administration’s tendency to include these organizations in the same category as Final Clubs obscures the fact that the sororities actively confront and address many of the concerns that the Final Clubs do not.
This very publication’s dismissal of the sorority system and the University’s unwillingness to recognize and support sororities reveals a fundamental flaw in the way we think about student life at Harvard. As a campus, we remain trapped in a state of mind that sees single sex organizations as unpalatable and divisive. We fail to recognize that at peer institutions around the country, similar single-sex social institutions provide meaning, support, and friendship for thousands of our peers, proving that it is possible to balance inclusivity with social fit and accountability with fun. I offer congratulations to Kappa, Theta, and DG as they accept new members and urge the administration to take a close look at the impact membership has on these students. I think they will find that organizations like these may be their closest allies in any effort to improve student satisfaction and foster strong social life on campus.

As the Harvard College Writing says, “We welcome you to Expos, a Harvard tradition”.
Since its inception in 1872, the expository writing requirement has been a staple of the Harvard experience, accommodating undergraduates from a range of writing backgrounds and academic aspirations. From the time of its founding, all undergraduates have been required to take at least one course in the expository writing department prior to graduation.
Nowadays, most undergraduates take part in the “Expos tradition” through Expos 20, the only course at Harvard with the distinction of, at some point, enrolling every student at Harvard. While strengthening Expos 10 and creating the option of Expos 30 are praiseworthy efforts on the part of the College to improve the expository writing program, the fact remains that most students will still take Expos 20 to satisfy their writing requirement.  In reforming expository writing, the College should direct its focus on Expos 20, the course that will undoubtedly continue to encompass the greater part of the student population.
In mandating a course for the entire student body, the College should take responsibility for ensuring the highest possible quality for this course. Evidence shows that Expos 20 lags behind other Expos courses in satisfaction ratings.
For the Fall 2009 term, Expos 10 received a 4.34 overall Q-score while Expos 20 received a 3.83. To compare, the benchmark for the humanities division was 4.24. While the Q score for Expos 20 is not distressingly low, the discrepancy between the division average and the course average outline an area for possible improvement. Action should be taken to evaluate the successes of Expos 10 and other Expos courses and re-create these successes in Expos 20.
Such evalutation starts foremost with the quality of preceptors, who are an integral part of expository writing courses. First and foremost, preceptor contracts should be evaluated on a yearly basis to weed out especially low-performing instructors. Preceptors not up to the high standards of the program should not continue to teach this specialized course. In addition, efforts should be made to standardize the curricula and difficulty levels across sections. Current standards made it too easy for a preceptor to design a course that focuses on personal interests at the expense of a unified writing curriculum. While we acknowledge the principle of expository writing that “good writing requires good thinking”, good thinking on specific topics should not take precedence over instruction on general writing skills. The freedom that preceptors appear to have in varying the difficulty of the course material should also be curtailed. Outlier Expos courses that are notorious for having higher or lower than average course loads defeat the purpose of having students complete the course with similar levels of instruction and contribute to general dissatisfaction with the program.
With Expos 30 being considered as a future add-on to the program, the writing program is taking a step in the right direction towards meeting student’s needs and addressing inconsistencies within the program.
At present, Expos 20 embodies a broad talent gradient with outliers at either end, creating an exceptionally difficult set of needs for any course to fill. Some of the inconsistencies within Expos 20 obviously stem from the diversity of incoming talent the course receives. While Expos 10 does an exemplary job providing for students who are not fully prepared for Expos 20, there is no sister program in place for students who have already developed a superior foundation in writing.
In redesigning Expos, the writing department should consider the structure used by the Harvard Mathematics Department. A broad range of courses from Math Ma to Math 55 cover many skill levels and provide students with an environment of peers of a similar ability level in the subject. The experience of like-minded engagement and exchange does a great deal to add to the enjoyment and effectiveness of the course for students. Though it cannot be considered a panacea, the option of Expos 30 should do a great deal to address the particular discontent of students who feel Expos 20 has little to add to their skill set.
Related to more effectively tracking students, the Expository Writing Program’s decision to re-design the writing placement exam shows insightful consideration on their part. The current process, a two-hour online essay, is arbitrary and does not reflect the type of writing required by most college courses. Indeed, it focuses on the writing skills students develop to get into college, e.g. the writing section of the SAT I, rather than the writing skills they will need to survive in a more advanced academic environment. The additional time allotted by the placement exam, in addition to its greater “rigor”, is a more characteristic representation of a typical college writing assignment.
In general, Harvard attracts a bright, motivated student population with a diversity of talents and should keep up their end of the bargain in providing these students with resources tailored to their particular skill set. That said, the Expository Writing Program, given the immense range of talents they cater to, should pay particular attention to how they differentiate between skill levels. Given that the majority of students will still enroll into Expos 20 to complete their expository writing requirement, this course should be at the focus of the current reform, though the more targeted Expos 10 and Expos 30 courses will certainly have their own important roles to play.
There is undoubtedly a strong demand for critical writing and interpretation skills within society and an indispensable need for a good writing curriculum within the College. However, Expos can only maintain its relevance within the modern liberal arts curriculum if it, like all long-standing traditions, accepts a certain amount of re-evaluation and renovation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Verizon recently began selling the iPhone 4, freeing aspiring iPhone users, who are no longer obliged to suffer under the tyranny of AT&T. In loosening the iPhone’s carrier regulations, Apple hopes to retake its number two-position in the smartphone wars; The L.A. Times reported in January that Google’s Android platform has overtaken Apple’s iPhone to have the 2nd-most smartphone subscribers in the U.S.. Meanwhile, the Blackberry is still the most prevalent device in the U.S. smartphone market. As the superpowers of hand-held technology clash over dominance overhead, it’s easy to forget the bystanders, the sheepish consumers who buy less sophisticated phones—students shamed into silences that their parsimonious natures overcome their technological savvy. No more. I am the proud owner of a dumbphone.
My simple-minded Samsung-A237 can make phone calls, send and receive texts, and take low-quality pictures. According to the user manual, Internet capability is also included, but the interface is so unwieldy and the connection so poor that I could probably walk to the Science Center from the Quad to check my email more easily. You might classify my phone as the student who works hard but has no brilliance.
On campus, the lack of a smartphone has rarely seemed fortuitous. Time-sensitive emails go unanswered for hours. Books titles, homework assignments, and miscellaneous notes I meant to write down are all forgotten. I once wandered up and down Oxford Street for thirty minutes searching for Maxwell Dworkin when a GoogleMap search would have solved that problem instantly.
Without sounding like a Luddite, however, the lack of accessible technology has done me a favor. Although my Google Calendar is chock full of lunch dates, assignments, and miscellaneous speakers, I memorize my schedule for the day before leaving my dorm, a high-stakes game, which is theoretically strengthening my brain power. Because texting outside becomes cumbersome once the weather gets freezing, and pushing buttons requires a large amount of force, I rarely text on-the-go. This frees me to greet people I meet along my way to class and admire the beauty of Harvard’s campus. Even getting lost has its perks as I have discovered secret gardens and hidden eateries in the area.
The single moment when I most lament not having a smartphone occurs when a lull of unexpected extra time appears, perhaps when waiting for a class to start or a friend to get ready. In this period, lucky smartphone students whip out their miniature machines and begin arranging the future or discussing the past. While the efficiency often makes me envious, my lack of advanced technology forces me to engage myself where I am. By escaping these shackles of technology, I intend to savor every Harvardian moment.
If given a free phone by the iPhone gods, I would hardly protest. To be perfectly honest, I would celebrate for days. Such compact technology represents convenience and scientific knowledge inconceivable decades ago. Alas I am too cheap to buy one for myself, so for now, my simpleton phone will suffice. While others pass the time playing games, video chatting, and emailing at their leisure, I intend to walk forward with eyes open and hands empty.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The past decade was an excellent one for the National Rifle Association. During the 1990s, they, and other gun-ownership advocates, were on the ropes, pummeled by the crime wave, school shootings, and Bill Clinton. The first decade of the new millennium, on the other hand, brought the repeal or expiration of a score of gun control measures as well as a Supreme Court precedent in District of Columbia v. Heller, which recognized an individual right to own firearms, thereby enshrining an individual-rights reading of the Second Amendment, which reads, “A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.” Even in the wake of the Tucson shootings, gun control advocates have made little headway.
However, the modern debate on the Second Amendment has disregarded a crucial element of constitutional analysis: what the amendment is for. The Bill of Rights does not simply create rights arbitrarily. Instead, they are understood to serve a particular purpose in keeping American society free and democratic. For example, the First Amendment is understood to protect political speech in particular; this consideration shapes how we think of the amendment in general and how the courts apply it.
In the end, there is only one plausible purpose for the Second Amendment: a safeguard against oppression. Furthermore, the amendment itself suggests this. Its first clause explains that the amendment exists to protect the “security of a free State.” A state free, presumably, from the oppression of a despotic federal government. The Second Amendment exists so that, should the federal government grow tyrannical, American citizens would be able to win a second Revolutionary War.
This understanding has crucial implications for the individual-rights reading of the Second Amendment. If the Second Amendment serves to protect the practical ability of violent insurrection in the face of intolerable governments, it creates a right and a duty to shoot tyrants. Under the individual-rights reading, such right and duty belongs to every citizen, entirely by themselves. Now, the image of each citizen being individually bound to defend freedom may be appealing. But there is a fundamental problem with such an arrangement.
The individual-rights reading does not only allow each citizen to act on their own against tyranny. It also grants each citizen the power to determine what constitutes tyranny to begin with. This understanding places the safety of all of our elected officials and civil servants in the hands of those who most oppose them. The individual-rights reading, considered fully, implies that any American can independently decide that the federal government is tyrannical, and take up arms against that government.
The militia reading of the Second Amendment is different. If the Second Amendment only protects the individual right to keep arms inasmuch as it is instrumental to protect the rights of states to organize effective militias, then the same problems of decision do not arise. State militias—the forerunners to today’s national guard—are neither lone individuals nor small groups of ideologues. Instead, they are responsible to state governments, which, in turn, are responsible to the people of a state. Militias would only take up arms against the national government if there were genuine, widespread support in their state. While militias do not always act rightly—the Civil War being the prime example—they are not a force for anarchy. They obey the same democratic accountability that the regular U.S. military does.
However, the Supreme Court has rejected a militia reading of the Second Amendment, preferring instead the individual reading—with all its unexamined implications. This brings us back to the tragedy in Tucson. Certainly, the accused Jared L. Loughner was not a model revolutionary. He may have been mentally ill; he was apparently willing to shoot innocents in his furor at his target. But not all political assassins are mentally ill (if ill Mr. Loughner was), and not all of them are so careless. Nevertheless, all assassinations are abhorrent to the people of the U.S. The vast outpouring of grief and sympathy after the shootings was proof enough of that.
This is the fundamental inconsistency implicit in the recent individual-rights reading of the Second Amendment. The problem is not merely that this reading sabotages sensible and important gun control legislation. Rather, it implicitly endorses assassination. If the Second Amendment exists to allow Americans to shoot tyrants, and if each of us can decide on our own when our government is tyrannical, and who is therefore a legitimate target of attack, then political assassinations are exercises of important political freedoms rather than violent, tragic attacks on our public servants. The response to the events in Arizona has shown what the American people think of such attacks. It remains to be seen whether we will accept an understanding of the Second Amendment that is inconsistent with our hatred of such violence.

There is a pig living in the kitchen at Annenberg Hall.
But this pig doesn’t oink or roll in the mud. Instead, it spends its day grinding leftover food and napkins.
On Saturday, seven students discovered the mysterious identity of the pig during the Annenberg Kitchen Facilities Tour, which provided an opportunity for freshmen to glimpse what goes on behind the scenes of their dining hall.
‘The pig’ is actually a nickname for the Somat food waste pulper and hydra extractor, according to Customer Service Manager Renee N. Soluk. This environmentally friendly equipment collects all organic waste from the kitchen and grinds it into a slushy mix, according to Soluk.
The hydra extractor then dehydrates the slurry mass to make a dry, odorless pulp for composting, which is packed into a bin and sent to a nearby pig farm to be used as animal feed.
As the students, who were selected on a first-come, first-served basis, entered the Annenberg kitchen, Soluk pointed out the stainless steel ovens for baking the multigrain margherita pizza, the fryer for cooking popcorn chicken and golden nuggets, and the skillets for sautéing julienne vegetables.
The tour exposed students to different parts of the kitchen facilities, including a walk-in refrigerator—which is bigger than many dorm rooms and stocked with gallons of milk, bottles of salad dressings, and tubs of cottage cheese.
It also featured a walk through the open kitchen where the Harvard University Hospitality and Dining Services staff prepares hundreds of bagged meals every morning.
Soluk said the dining staff places emphasis on safety procedure, constantly monitoring and measuring the temperature of food and changing utensils to maintain the sanitation of the dining hall and limit the amount of exposure to bacteria.
Soluk said although each House has a kitchen, they are “not as large as the one at Annenberg because they don’t serve 1,600 people.”
Inspired by the great halls of Oxford and Cambridge Universities, Annenberg, built in 1874, initially served as a gathering place, Commencement location, and exam hall until 1994, when it was converted into a dining hall for freshman. The 9,000-square-foot Annenberg seats about 600 students in its custom-made tables and chairs.
As a freshman-only dining hall, Annenberg enforces its strict restrictions and only allows upperclassmen to dine there at breakfast for most of the year.

Ilya Chalik ’11—an avid traveler and a Tai Chi expert—died yesterday in his Adams dorm room, according to Adams House administrators.
Chalik, a History and Science concentrator from Chicago, was a “real part of Adams, a real member of the community,” said his entryway tutor, Vineeta Agarwala. “Which is why I think so many people miss him.”
At a remembrance gathering last night in the Adams Lower Common Room, there were not enough chairs to accommodate all those who wanted to pay their respects.
Friends shared fond memories of Chalik, remembering his generosity and kindness.
“One of the common themes running through all the stories was how welcoming and how generous Ilya really was,” said Rory M. Sullivan ’09, who knew Chalik from Harvard Hillel and attended the memorial in Adams.
“He would always greet you and ask you how you were,” said Abigail F. Schoenberg ’12, who went on a Birthright trip to Israel with Chalik two years ago. “That was such a rare thing to find in a person.”
Abby E. Schiff ’11, one of Chalik’s blockmates, said Chalik spontaneously brought roses to give to her after her performance in an a cappella concert as a “little special touch.”
“He was very gentle-manly in everything he did,” Schiff said.
She described Chalik as spontaneous, adventurous, and a person who loved to travel.
“He would take these day trips to Providence or Maine or New Hampshire on a whim and would come back with pictures and stories,” she said.
As secretary of the Harvard College in Asia Program, Chalik went on trips to Singapore and Seoul during his sophomore and junior years, respectively. He studied abroad in Argentina his freshman summer and Colombia his junior summer, in addition to participating in the Harvard Hillel Birthright trip his sophomore year.
Hillel Rabbi Ben Greenberg said that Chalik “was someone who was so genuinely interested in others.”
Greenberg recalled a time when Chalik turned the tables on the rabbi.
“He came up to me one time and he said to me, “How is your work going today? What is your job like?” said Greenberg.
When the rabbi commented on this reversal of roles, Chalik shrugged off his inquiry with a smile. “I’m just curious to know how you’re doing,” he said, according to Greenberg.
In addition to serving as an active member of Harvard Hillel, Chalik was also president of the Tai Chi Tiger Crane Club and worked as a stacks assistant at Widener since 2007.
“He was a friend of everyone,” Adams House Master Judith S. Palfrey ‘67 said. “He was a real campus leader.”
Members of the Adams community were informed of Chalik’s death yesterday at a 4 p.m. meeting with House and College administrators in Adams dining hall.
As per procedure, the Middlesex District Attorney’s office is currently conducting an investigation into Chalik’s passing.
At the meeting, Associate Dean of the College John L. “Jay” Ellison,  said that there was no violence involved in Chalik’s death.
Later yesterday afternoon Evelynn M. Hammonds, dean of Harvard college, sent an e-mail informing the College community of Chalik’s passing.
Hammonds’s e-mail stated that counseling services are available to students through Harvard Mental Health Services and University Health Services.

Over 100 custodial workers—some of them Harvard employees—rallied outside of Trinity Church in Copley Square on Saturday to call for full-time employment for all custodial workers.
As part of a rally organized by Service Employees International Union (SEIU) Local 615, custodial workers and their family members gathered in Boston to listen to speakers and voice their support for the living wage.
“All the best economists will tell you: The best way to revitalize the economy is not to give the money to the rich, who will sit on it in the bank, but to give it to you, who will spend it on your groceries and on your gasoline,” said State Senator Sonia R. Chang-Diaz, who spoke to an emotionally charged crowd.
The event, which included speakers such as State Representative Carlos Enriques and Chang-Diaz as well as workers describing how they overcame adversity, took place simultaneously in Spanish and English.
Olga Becerra, a Harvard janitor who has worked at the University since 2002, told the crowd about her husband losing his construction job and how they almost lost their house. She said that without full-time jobs, it is hard for working class families to keep a roof over their heads.
Workers and their families braved sub-freezing conditions for several hours to show their support.
“It is cold, but we will fight,” said Carlos Atildo, a husband of a janitorial worker. For much of the rally he held a sign which read, “The fight for: Time with our loved ones.”
Organizers said the rally emphasized the need for custodial workers to be able to spend time with their families, which can be difficult while they juggle multiple jobs.
“The working class is making less for the first time in a generation,” said Chang-Diaz, who later called for “more than just a basic wage—a living wage,” for the custodial workers.
Grace Agosto, a student at Suffolk University and the daughter of a janitor, also spoke about the importance of family in working class households, saying that her mother’s presence in her life helped shaped her.
“All parents love to spend time with their kids,” Agosto said. “But they are too busy putting shelter over their heads and food on their table.”
Speakers at the event argued that full-time employment for custodial workers and their families, but the larger community as well.
“The future of the country we believe in very much depends on the people who work, the people moving us forward,” said State Representative Elizabeth A. Malia.
Anna Alarán, who attended the event and whose husband is a member of SEIU, said she felt the event was a success.
“This is good energy,” Alarán said.  “It shows we are strong.”
Throughout the rally, various chants were exchanged between the speakers and the audience. “Together we fight,” one speaker chanted in Spanish. “Together we win,” the audience responded.

On Friday morning, Tarek Anous, a research assistant in physics, stepped out of class to receive a phone call from his mother. She was calling from Egypt with the news: Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak had resigned.
“I began sprinting and yelling and making a fool of myself,” he said. “I returned to class and yelled to everybody that Mubarak had resigned.”
His classmates were surprised—the previous night Mubarak had refused to step down from his post, announcing instead that he would oversee government reforms. Less than 24 hours later—to the delight of Anous’s family—Mubarak resigned.
After 18 days of anti-government demonstrations, the Egyptian military seized power from Mubarak on Friday and has since reassured the Egyptian protesters that their demands will be met. Yesterday, a statement by the Supreme Council of Armed Forces dissolved the Egyptian parliament, suspended the nation’s constitution, and promised elections in six months.
The military has historically protected the status quo in Egypt, but despite its recent reassuring tone, some Egyptians are concerned there is almost no check on the military’s new power.
Anous said that it was his professor who tempered his high spirits Friday morning. “This is clearly not the end,” he reminded the class, according to Anous.
“The truth of the matter is that Mubarak himself was a military man, and we know the military helped him stay in power,” said Anous, who attended high school in Egypt. “At the same time every statement they have made has seemed to ring with the pulse of the streets.”
Anous said it was too early to determine whether the Egyptian military will follow through on its promises to meet the demands of the protesters’, but added that he personally believes that the military will keep its word.
“I think the Egyptian army is going to maintain stability,” Government and Sociology Professor Theda R. Skocpol said.Skocpol.
The United States has traditionally played a prominent role as a supporter and ally of Egypt, and Skocpol predicted it will continue to have a strong influence over the country’s future.
“[The Egyptian military will] go along with a transition that will satisfy the U.S., that a constitutional regime is in place,” she said.
The creation of a new constitution will play a central role in the transition to a new Egyptian government.
Skocpol highlighted the difficulty of creating a new constitution in a country with many different political groups.
“The protestors are not united, and that means those who are invited to frame a new constitution will come from diverse sources because there is no one opposition group—there are a lot.”
Pundits have voiced concerns that the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamic political party that has been officially banned since 1954, will play a strong role in writing a new constitution. While some say the Muslim Brotherhood should be left out of discussions about Egypt’s future, Skocpol disagrees.
“If [the Muslim Brotherhood] is excluded in any way, that will set the stage for a much worse outcome in my opinion,” she said. “They will turn to armed resistance that a fragile constitutional order may not be able to withstand. But they are not strong enough to take over the constitutional discussion, so the best thing is to include them.”
She added that the Obama administration will most likely support the inclusion of the Muslim Brotherhood in constitutional discussion and predicted the move will spark controversy in the U.S.
“I think the competing Republicans will yell about it, so the real drama will be just as much in American politics as it will be in Egyptian politics.“

The Undergraduate Council will move forward with the Student Initiated Program (SIP) fund, members said at last night’s council meeting, where plans for the first event of the semester were discussed.
The SIP, which is part of the UC’s effort to improve social life on campus, marks the first time that the Council has funded alcohol since the elimination of the party grants program in 2007.
The program—which has been a work in progress for a year and a half—got approval from House masters last semester, clearing the final hurdle to its implementation.
After two pilot programs in Quincy and Pforzheimer Houses last spring, the  first official SIP event will likely be held in Mather House within the next few weeks, according to Daniel P. Bicknell ’13, a co-chair of the Mather House Committee.
The UC and Mather HoCo met with the Mather House Masters last fall. According to Bicknell, the House Masters were supportive and seemed excited to host a SIP event.
“Mather has great House life and community spirit and there is usually a solid attendance at House events,” Bicknell said. “With UC funding I think it would be great event for both the House and the surrounding neighborhood as well.”
According to UC Student Initiatives Committee Chair David Gonzalez ’11, the UC will be meeting with both the Mather House Masters and HoCo on Tuesday to coordinate a date for the event.
If a date can be set, an application will be sent out to Mather residents, who may then apply to receive funding to host the SIP event.
“We are looking for creativity,” Gonzalez said. “When people apply to us to get money we are going to reward the ideas that are most creative.”
Each SIP grant is worth around $400. According to Gonzalez, there are no real “hard and fast rules” about how to spend the money, although students will receive some guidelines for using the funds. House Masters have some authority to determine where money goes, but in the end, the students hold the ultimate control, Gonzalez said.
Last year, when the pilot programs took place, the UC received about a half-dozen proposals, according to Gonzalez.
“We are expecting similar numbers this year, perhaps more,” he said. “There has certainly been more anticipation.”
A few changes will also be made based on feedback from the two pilot programs. While House masters last year insisted on having police present to monitor the SIP events, it was decided that this precaution was unnecessary and will no longer be enforced, Gonzalez said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith joined three instructors at a symposium on teaching and learning this past Friday.
The panel discussion—with Computer Science Lecturer David J. Malan ’99, Professor of the Practice of Theatre Diane M. Paulus ’87, and Sociology Professor Christopher Winship—focused on initiatives the three have spearheaded to better educate Harvard undergraduates.
“If the student learns best from sitting in lectures, then we have that option,” Malan said. “If students learn more from skimming the slides and then really exploring the material in sections, students can do that too,”
Colleagues and students have credited Malan for boosting enrollment in his popular class, Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science.”
“We’ve spent some significant amount of time on how to get to the students invigorated in the class,” Malan said.
As dean, Smith has consistently stressed boosting “teaching and learning” in classes within FAS. Friday’s panel, hosted by Smith, was the latest initiative aiming to draw attention to the subject. Past efforts have included increased emphasis on classes that prepare teaching fellows at the Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning.
Malan described how both his teaching fellows and he placed tremendous emphasis on course problem sets, which allow students “to really get their hands dirty in the material—and can take up to 20 hours, sometimes.”
Malan encouraged the faculty and staff present—including Smith and Dean of the College Evelyn M. Hammonds—to “interactively” learn, encouraging audience members to participate in one of the games that he uses in his opening lecture of CS50 to determine the number of people present in a room.
“One-hundred and twenty-two—well, given that the capacity for this room is 120, and there are some people standing in the back, I’d say that’s pretty accurate,” Malan said.
Paulus used examples of local theater productions—such as “The Donkey Show”—to demonstrate audience involvement in successful performances.
“My whole priority in theater is to get the audience to feel like they have an opinion,” Paulus said. “I’m always craving that sports environment where you have people criticizing the plays.”
Still, Winship discussed some attempts he made that were unsuccessful due to student resistance.
“We tried to implement a new system, where students build their grades up from a zero,” he said. “And we quickly changed, when we realized that students didn’t really like having a 29 mid-semester.”

As sororities’ rush season draws to a close and fraternities’ recruitment period moves ahead full-steam, those seeking a place in Harvard’s Greek life scene say they want more than to be just another frat brother or sorority sister—they want community.
While acknowledging that extracurricular activities and House life do offer a social outlet, rushes interviewed by The Crimson said that fraternities and sororities fulfill a different role.
“With fraternities, it’s specifically about the camaraderie,” said Stephen P. Murphy ’13, who is currently rushing Sigma Chi.“Fraternities are more focused on the people whereas the extracurriculars are more about the interest.”
Louis A. Cid ’14, who received an invitation under his door encouraging him to come and to bring friends to Sigma Chi’s rush event, said that the variety of students within fraternities appealed to him.
“All the other groups that are around have a very specific goal and a common interest,” Cid said. “I think Sigma Chi is cool because everyone has all kinds of interests.”
Women rushing Harvard’s sororities had similar reasons.  Distance runner Catherine G. Hasbrouck ’14—a baby, or new member, of Delta Gamma—said she rushed because she wanted to meet girls who were not on the track team.
Greek leaders added that the purchase of spaces by fraternities and sororities may have contributed to increased interest.
Sigma Chi has had a house on Arrow Street for ten years and Sigma Alpha Epsilon recently purchased an apartment on Harvard Street, according to the fraternities’ respective presidents.
Delta Gamma said on its Facebook page that it acquired an apartment last year and a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma said that the group is in the process of purchasing its own space.
Phillip J. Morris ’12, president of SAE, said that it was possible that the club’s recent acquisition of a social space contributed to the increase in rush numbers this year.
Morris also attributed the increase in rush numbers to the collaborative efforts of both fraternities and sororities to expand the Greek presence on campus.
“I think just Greeks getting their name out has had a big effect,” Morris said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Alexandra L. Bradbury ’13 was at a horse race in Scotland with her  best friend Nicola V. Maasdorp ’13 when the College Admissions Office  called to tell her that she had been accepted to Harvard off the  waitlist.
After learning of Bradbury’s admission, the pair decided to bet on horses—and promptly lost.
“It was too much good luck for one day,” Bradbury muses.
Inseparable since meeting in chemistry class at age 14, Bradbury and  Maasdorp grew up together in Zimbabwe and both applied to Harvard during  their final year of high school.
Although Maasdorp was accepted during the normal admissions cycle, Bradbury was waitlisted until the summer.
“I was like, ‘C’mon, Harvard, just hurry up and call her,’” recalls  Maasdorp of the agonizing few months before they learned they would be  spending their college years together. “And then they called, and Alex  was just shell-shocked. But I was over the moon.”
Bradbury and Maasdorp are among a number of pairs on campus—both  romantic and platonic—who spent their high school years together before  both coming to Harvard. While these couples and best friends sometimes  struggle to maintain a balance between spending time with each other and  their new college friends, the consensus is clear: Harvard is even  better when your best friend forever is right down the hall.
EXPANDING SOCIAL CIRCLES
Previously established friendships among freshmen are hardly new at  Harvard. For many years, the administration even encouraged the  phenomenon by allowing incoming freshmen to request roommates. However,  that policy was terminated in the 1980s.
According to Dean of Freshman Thomas A. Dingman ’67, the change was  made to widen the narrow social circles that tended to develop among  high school friends.
“Under the old system, students were coming in with a built-in  community,” says Dingman. “There wasn’t the incentive to go out and meet  people.”
Although they can no longer select their roommates, freshmen have largely embraced the change, says Dingman.
In fact, Dingman says he thinks that some freshmen are relieved to  have the stress of choosing a roommate taken out of their hands. He  cites a former freshman from a Boston-area high school who came to  Harvard with many high school friends—all of whom would have wanted to  be her roommate, he recalls she said.
According to Dingman, the student told him “how nice it had been to not have to confront that decision.”
EASING THE TRANSITION
But for many freshmen who come to Harvard with a best friend or  significant other from high school, this connection can make the  adjustment to college much easier.
During their first weeks at Harvard, Bradbury and Maasdorp relied on  each other to ease the transition to both college and American life.  According to Bradbury, it was because of this support that Harvard  “became our home so quickly.”
Maasdorp says that their friendship gave her space to relax in the hectic first days of freshman year.
“When you’re meeting all these people, sometimes you just want to be yourself,” she says.
Their connection also gave Maasdorp relief from the attention she garnered as an international student.
“Everyone tells me I’m really interesting because I’m foreign. You  can’t imagine how nice it is to have someone who thinks I’m typical and  kind of boring,” she quips.
Robert E. Powers ’14 says he thinks that his relationship with Alison  Liou ’14—his best friend since third grade and his girlfriend since  senior year of high school—actually allowed him to meet more new people  than he would have otherwise.
“Off the bat, because of our relationship, we created a social  circle,” he says. “I’m not sure if I could have done that on my own.”
STRIKING A BALANCE
As comforting as it can to be to have a connection from high school  during Opening Days, most students eventually move on to new college  friends. Students who come to Harvard with a best friend or significant  other say it can be tricky to balance the old and the new.
However, these pairs claim that the secret to maintaining their  relationships is to set aside time to spend together while still  pursuing independent activities.
As they adjusted to life at Harvard, Maasdorp says she and Bradbury began spending more time apart.
“We completely branched out,” she says. “Towards the end of last  year, we didn’t see each other a lot. But we always had each other as  backups ... we’re like an old married couple.”
Byran N. Dai ’11 and Alexander K. Sherbany ’11—an inactive Crimson  editorial editor and photo editor, respectively—share a similar story.
Although they were best friends in high school, they are now pursuing  different concentrations, participating in different extracurricular  activities, and even living in different residential houses, they say.
“You’re not doing yourself a favor if you don’t go a little out of  your comfort zone,” says Sherbany. “I think we were successful with  that.”
Sheema Golbaba ’14 and Tyler J. Ott ’14, who are a couple, have also  maintained separate lives at Harvard. Golbaba and Ott, who started  dating at the end of eighth grade, were never “that couple that was  always together,” Golbaba says.
Now in college, they say they make an effort to see each other twice during the week and at least once during the weekend.
This distance is beneficial to their relationship, according to Golbaba.
“Not that I wouldn’t want to have dinner with you every night, but I  feel like that would create problems,” she says affectionately to Ott.
THE BLOCKING QUESTION
For best friends and couples who are separated into different dorms  their freshman year, the blocking process provides a potential way to  reunite.
Dingman says he thinks the decision to block with a significant other  or best friend is “very case-specific.” For example, he warns that it  can be “potentially risky” for romantic couples to block together in  case the relationship turns sour.
Although Bradbury and Maasdorp decided to block together, they made  the conscious decision to choose different roommates within their  blocking group.
“We know we work together,” says Maasdorp. “We wanted to spread around and see how we work with other people.”
When asked if they planned to block together, Ott and Golbaba started laughing.
“I don’t think that would work,” says Golbaba. “Our friends are very different.”
While Golbaba says she associates with the “artsy kids,” Ott says he spends his free time with members of the football team.
“It would make for a very disparate group,” Ott says delicately.
BEST FRIENDS FOREVER?
As students look into their post-Harvard future, they must sometimes  confront their separation from a lifelong best friend or significant  other.
Dai and Sherbany, who are applying to jobs and internships in  different regions of the United States, will likely go their separate  ways this coming summer.
“[Our separation] will be a bittersweet moment,” says Dai. “But I’m looking forward to staying in touch.”
Sherbany says he is not worried about the future of his friendship with Dai.
“Every time we sit down, it’s like no time at all had passed,” he says.
On the other hand, longtime best friends Meryl F. Natow ’13 and  Alexandra “Ali” P. Berman ’13 jokingly say that a future apart from each  other is incomprehensible.
“I can’t remember the last time I wasn’t with Ali,” says Natow. “I can’t get rid of her.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Kennedy School has a plethora of programs focused on women and gender issues.
The Kennedy School Women and Public Policy Program organizes weekly seminars on gender, works on bringing women to speak at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum, and  provides training services to young female scholars.
This year, students can even take a class entitled “Closing the Global Gender Gap,” which focuses on how to design efficient policies to increase gender equity across the world.
Yet in spite of these efforts to raise awareness on the issue of gender imbalance, the percentage of female faculty at the Kennedy School—although improving from year to year—has remained very low over the past decade.
Approximately 27 percent of the junior faculty and 22 percent of the senior faculty at the Kennedy School were women in the last academic year, according to the annual report of the Office of the Senior Vice Provost for Faculty Development and Diversity.
These numbers are similar to the percentage of female faculty at Harvard professional schools in general—34 percent of junior faculty and 20 percent of senior faculty were female.
But they are low compared to other schools of government in the U.S.
Three out of the four peer institutions used as benchmarks in the report have a higher percentage of female junior faculty members, while the fourth had an equal number, and two of the peer schools also had higher percentages of female senior faculty.
“It is a huge problem,” Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood ’75 says of the gender imbalance. “We’ve got to stop missing women.”
THE QUANTITATIVE ADVANTAGE
According to Ellwood and other Kennedy School faculty members, one of the main reasons for the gender imbalance might be the school’s focus on quantitative fields such as economics, areas in which men have historically been more active than women.
Consequently, when the Kennedy School opens a position in these fields, there are often more male than female applicants.
“When you hire, you hire from the pool that’s available,” says former Kennedy School Dean Joseph S. Nye, Jr.
Kennedy School Academic Dean Mary Jo Bane declined to provide data about the number of women hired by the Kennedy School in each department annually, saying that these numbers are “not very meaningful year by year” since the Kennedy School hires only a small number of faculty members each year.
The Kennedy School’s Office of Communications and Public Affairs was unable to confirm that economics classes are mostly taught by male faculty while social sciences classes are mostly taught by women.
However, all 10 tenured professors of political economy at the Kennedy School are male.
Teaching large social sciences classes is typically more time-consuming than teaching economics courses, because essays take longer to grade than problem sets, say multiple Kennedy School professors.
But teaching large lecture courses fulfills an important requirement for Kennedy School faculty. Consequently, social sciences professors who do not teach many large lecture classes due to the time constraints of grading must spend more time on other tasks such as mentoring or book writing to compensate, professors say.
WORK-LIFE BALANCE
But the gender imbalance could also be explained by many other factors, according to Kennedy School professor Jane J. Mansbridge. Mansbridge was on the 2005 Harvard Task Force on Women Faculty and served for several years as the Kennedy School’s liaison to the Office of the Senior Vice Provost for Faculty Development and Diversity.
Unlike other peer institutions, the Kennedy School does not tenure junior faculty, putting significant pressure on young associate professors who must juggle a demanding low-security job and a while potentially starting a family, according to Mansbridge.
“Most universities tenure at the associate level, so you write [your required] book and then you can have a baby,” Mansbridge says.
But to achieve tenure at the Kennedy School, young parents—who Mansbridge says are disproportionately female—have to raise their children while writing books and teaching.
‘A TOPIC OF CONVERSATION’
Kennedy School professors and students raise other concerns about gender equity, including the relatively high number of female lecturers, who are not tenure-track professors, and the pattern of women teaching non-required courses.
“Our women tend to be not in the ladder faculty but in lectureship,” Kennedy School Professor Monica D. Toft says.
And Emily R. Polak, the co-chair of the Kennedy School Progressive Caucus, says there are only seven women out of 30 professors this year teaching core courses for the Master in Public Policy program.
The program requires students to take certain courses during their first year. Called the Core Curriculum, they include classes on markets, economic policy, and management of public organizations.
This situation has triggered frustration among both professors and students.
Sarah B. Bouchat, co-chair of the Kennedy School’s Women and Gender Caucus, says she was able to take classes with four female faculty members so far, but says that was mostly because of her specific areas of interest.
“I had to put in a lot of effort to make it happen,” Bouchat says.
Many students also say that because they have mostly male professors, they are not exposed to as many diverse perspectives as they could be otherwise.
“Men and women see things differently,” says Tammy L. Wisco, a Kennedy School mid-career student pursuing a master’s degree in public administration.
MOVING FORWARD
When Ellwood was appointed dean in 2004, he said one of his top priorities was to work on the issue of gender equity at the Kennedy School. In spite of the school’s lower numbers compared to peer institutions over the last academic year, the gender balance has improved during Ellwood’s tenure.
“One of the ways I’d like to be judged is on the progress that happens,” Ellwood says.
Since he took office, Ellwood has more than doubled the number of tenured female faculty and appointed Bane as academic dean.
Ellwood says that he intends to keep working on improving the situation of women faculty, but that he has “no immediate plans.”
Yet many faculty members remain positive.
“Progress is happening, but we started from a very low level,” says Iris Bohnet, director of the Kennedy School’s Women and Public Policy Program. She adds that when she first came to the Kennedy School in 1988, the percentage of female faculty was probably below 10 percent.
Toft says she thinks Ellwood has shown some good will, but that the causes of the problem are difficult to address because some of them are out of the school’s control.
“I do think he’s trying,” she says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a tough weekend for the Harvard women’s basketball team, as its seven-game winning streak came to an end after losing both to conference rival Yale Friday night and a struggling Brown team the following evening.
The Crimson (13-8, 5-2 Ivy) was the favorite to win against the Bulldogs (10-12, 6-2) but found itself down, 39-19, at the half. Harvard picked it up after the intermission, but its attempts fell short and the Crimson lost on the road, 82-71. Harvard played a nail-biter Saturday night against sixth-ranked Brown (7-15, 3-5), failing to hit its last two shots and falling, 57-56. Senior Emma Markley led the team with a double-double, but her efforts weren’t enough to carry the Crimson to victory.
“[We’re] extremely disappointed in both [games],” said Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith. “We felt we could have won both and we let both of them slip away…There’s nothing really else to say.”
The Crimson, undefeated and leading the Ivy League going into the weekend, dropped below Princeton and Yale to settle at third in the conference standings.
BROWN 57, HARVARD 56
Harvard’s offense was cold against the Bears on Saturday, as it was held to a shooting percentage of 33.9 from the field, the lowest the Crimson has had in conference play thus far. This was also the first time Brown grabbed a victory over Harvard since its 2005-2006 Ivy Championship season.
“We got great shots,” Delaney-Smith said. “They weren’t falling for us all weekend.”
Co-captain Christine Matera also noticed the weak attack, as Brown’s defense held three Crimson players scoreless and ensured that the visiting team had its lowest three-point percentage since Feb. 13, 2010.
“Offensively we weren’t very fluid,” she said. “I think we need to work on moving the ball better.”
Markley led the stagnant offense and posted her second double-double of the season, racking up 22 points and 11 rebounds.
The Bears jumped out to a fast start, knocking down two three-pointers to open the game, 6-2, but Harvard remained in striking distance as the two teams battled for the lead throughout the first half. The Crimson went into halftime losing, 38-29.
“Brown played an amazing game,” said Delaney-Smith, despite the Bears’ lackluster season. “They’re able to put together a great game.”
Harvard came out strong in the second half, outscoring Brown by eight points after the break. The Crimson pulled the game to 52-50 with seven minutes remaining, then lost some ground before bringing it back within two with 48 seconds left.
Harvard regained possession with 21 seconds on the clock after forcing a Brown turnover and immediately called a timeout. With the game on the line, the Crimson bounced the shot off the rim, snagged the rebound, but again missed the basket as the final seconds counted down.
YALE 82, HARVARD 71
Harvard also struggled on Friday night against Yale, as the offense faltered once again and the opponent jumped out to an early 9-2 lead. The Crimson never caught up after that point, as the Bulldogs dominated the game from start to finish.
“We just played really flat,” Matera said. “In the Yale game, I feel like we were set back on our heels for the majority of the game.”
There was little for Harvard to smile about in the final minutes of the half, as the Elis went on a 20-7 run and forced 10 Crimson turnovers. By halftime, Yale sat on a 20-point advantage, and Harvard’s powerful offense had only managed 19 points in the half.
Things improved for the Crimson after halftime as it managed to gain nine points to come within 11, but the Bulldogs held them to a comfortable distance for the rest of the half.
Sophomore Victoria Lippert led Harvard’s offense with 18 points.
“It was obviously a pretty disappointing weekend for us,” Matera said. “It was a pretty unexpected result.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
His team down by 22 points to Brown at halftime, Harvard men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker saw nothing but an opportunity for his young squad.
“Coach was just like, ‘This is going to be part of our story. Being down 20 to Brown…at the end of the season, we’ll look back and say this is one of the moments that helped us win the Ivy League,’” sophomore wing Christian Webster said.
While at least three weekends of basketball remain before Amaker’s prediction can come to fruition, the Ivy title hopes for this year’s team—tied for the best start in conference play in school history—managed to avoid a dramatic setback Saturday night.
Engineering the second-largest comeback in league history, Harvard (18-4, 7-1 Ivy) opened the second half on a 48-15 run to secure a relatively comfortable 85-78 win over the Bears (9-13, 2-6) at Lavietes Pavilion.
The victory helped the Crimson remain half a game behind league leader Princeton, which swept its Columbia-Cornell road trip this weekend.
Twenty minutes into Saturday evening’s matchup, it looked as if the Crimson’s good fortune at home—where it has won a program-record 15 straight—had finally run out.
A crowd of 1,377 saw the hosts play sluggishly out of the gate, quickly falling behind by 10 at 14:11 after the Bears hit seven of their first eight shots.
The situation grew more grim ten minutes into the contest when Crimson guard Oliver McNally injured his ankle on a drive to the basket.
The junior co-captain had to be helped off the floor by two teammates and sat out the second half with a protective boot on his left foot.
Its backcourt leader relegated to the bench, Harvard turned it over 12 times in the first half and had defensive troubles inside and out.
Brown proceeded to score on nine of its final 11 possessions of the half, building a lead as large as 24 on 19-of-30 shooting from the field, including 8-of-12 from behind the arc.
“They were just on fire, and sometimes you run into that,” Amaker said. “We haven’t been great defending the three, so we were very concerned with that at the start, and they proved us right.”
But despite all signs pointing toward a Bears upset, Harvard had another ending to its story in mind.
Sophomore Kyle Casey and junior co-captain Keith Wright combined for Harvard’s first 10 points out of intermission, capped by a two-handed slam by Casey off an errant three-pointer by Webster.
“Oliver and myself, we take it upon ourselves to keep the team going and keep us focused,” Casey said. “I think leadership-wise and vocally, I took it upon myself to get the team going,”
The dominant pair totaled 41 points on the night, and Wright’s 14 rebounds gave the veteran his ninth double-double of the year.
With the Crimson frontcourt converting underneath, the squad’s shooters began to heat up from the perimeter, especially with both teams content to ramp up the game’s pace.
Four minutes into the half, sophomore guard Brandyn Curry sprinted down the court in transition and found Webster in the left corner for a three-pointer that brought Harvard within 13.
After a Brown miss, Curry—who had sustained an ankle injury the night before—pushed the tempo again, this time finding Rivard on the right wing for a triple to cut the deficit to 10.
After both squads traded baskets, it was again Curry who helped bring it to single digits, driving to the basket and kicking it out to Rivard for another three.
Webster’s turn came nearly two minutes later, when he took a swing pass from Rivard and knocked down a left wing triple, making the score 64-60 with 10:12 to play and setting off the traditional “I believe that we will win” chant by the now-revitalized crowd.
By then, the Bears’ fate was almost inevitable.
The long-range tries that had come so easily in the first half were no longer falling, and when Brown made it to the hoop, it had to contend with Wright and Casey, who combined for eight blocks on the night.
The Bears also appeared to have caught the turnover bug that had plagued Harvard in the first half.
Reveling in the spirit of the moment, Curry made a nifty steal and threw the ball ahead to Wright, whose two-handed fast-break dunk made it 64-62 with 9:26 left.
Brown missed yet again, and this time Curry kept it himself, holding up three fingers to the fans after nailing a straight-on three to give the Crimson a 65-64 advantage.
Though a difficult fall-away jumper from Brown’s Tucker Halpern provided the third lead change of the night, the Bears would turn it over on their next time down the floor, setting up another three by Webster.
The sharpshooter’s second-half spurt represented a strong recovery from his 0-for-7 performance from the field in the first half.
“Coach told me to keep shooting, and shooters shoot, so I just kept shooting,” Webster said. “I found my rhythm.”
His squad’s hopes slowly slipping away, Halpern launched a long three but was unable to convert.
Casey punctuated the 39-13 run with an athletic move in the post, earning a three-point play and a hug from his teammate Wright.
Though Harvard did not play flawlessly the rest of the way, the lead would reach as large as 11 for the Crimson, which hit the necessary free throws to cement the win.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After getting blanked in its previous game, Harvard men’s hockey team fought hard in a back-and-forth and high-scoring overtime tie against Princeton Friday night at the Bright Hockey Center.
Though the Crimson came out sluggish at first, Harvard (4-18-1, 3-13-1 ECAC) was eventually able to battle back from three deficits to a 4-4 draw against the Tigers (14-8-2, 9-6-2).
Each period of the game featured a distinct style of play.
During the first 10 minutes of the night, Princeton outplayed the Crimson, beating Harvard to loose pucks and gaining a significant shot advantage.
The Crimson players showed physicality and delivered some jarring hits early on, but the Tigers seemed to play with more urgency and finesse.
“I think we had a game plan coming out, but we came out a little flat,” junior forward Alex Killorn said.
After a sluggish start and a late first period goal by Princeton, Harvard caught a break when sophomore forward Conor Morrison was able to chip in a shot past Tigers goalie Sean Bonar, who had slipped in the crease.
Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 called an early timeout halfway through the first, and his team seemed reenergized after talking things over on the bench.
The second period felt like an entirely different game, as the flow of play was halted by a combined eight penalties.
“I don’t mind the aggressive penalties that are necessary, but we took a couple of penalties that left us scratching our heads,” Donato said.
Both teams were able to capitalize on 5-on-3 advantages during the period, and the second frame ended in a 3-3 tie.
“We were really focusing on getting guys to the net, so if a rebound came up, we could capitalize on that,” Killorn said. “We were getting a lot of shots on net, and we weren’t worried about pretty plays.”
The power play was a big factor throughout the game, as Harvard went 3-for-5 with a man-advantage. Princeton’s penalty kill was lackluster throughout the night, and the Crimson was able to take advantage of the weakness.
“They weren’t really pretty goals, but they all count,” Killorn added.
The third period had its own distinct feel, as both sides fought hard to get the go-ahead goal. The lack of flow in the second period was soon forgotten, and both teams moved freely up and down the ice.
The Tigers pulled ahead, 4-3, on a long wrister, but Harvard continued fighting for the equalizer.
Throughout the third period, each of the Crimson lines brought high energy, putting the puck on net 12 times.
Eventually, the persistence paid off, as forward Alex Killorn redirected a puck into the net with about five minutes remaining to tie the game at four.
Starting in net for Harvard was senior Kyle Richter, who proved to be effective, keeping the Crimson in the game when Princeton attempted to pull away. With less than a minute left, Richter made a critical game-saving stop that sent the contest into overtime.
In the extra period, both teams had a number of chances, but neither side could break through. Richter made another important save on a wraparound attempt with less than a minute remaining in the extra period.
Though the crowd was anxious for a definite outcome, they left the rink having seen one of Harvard’s most competitive ECAC matches of the season.
After the game, both Donato and forward Killorn mentioned that rebounds were something that the team has focused on in practice.
“It’s not just the number of shots,” Donato said. “It’s really being able to get second and third opportunities and getting some of the goals in the dirty areas, the areas that are tough to play in around the net.”
This emphasis on second chance opportunities allowed Harvard to stay competitive against one of the better teams in the conference.
“I thought our guys really battled,” Donato said. “We feel like we are a team that has improved tremendously over the last couple months.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Anyone expecting a letdown between Harvard’s exciting win over Northeastern and the hype surrounding the Crimson’s upcoming Beanpot finals matchup against Boston College was simply wrong.
Harvard (14-8-4, 13-4-3 ECAC) found itself on Friday and Saturday afternoons in overtime thrillers against ECAC opponents Clarkson (11-14-6, 8-7-4) and St. Lawrence (13-16-2, 8-11-0).
HARVARD 3, ST. LAWRENCE 2
In a weekend of big momentum shifts and up-and-down battles, no moment was bigger than sophomore Josephine Pucci’s goal with 14 seconds remaining in the second period that tied the game at 2-2.
This goal helped force the game into overtime, where Harvard would ultimately prevail, 3-2, in a big win for the Crimson Saturday afternoon at the Saints’ Appleton Arena.
Jillian Dempsey notched three goals for the weekend and netted the winning goal in overtime.
“She came up big for us this weekend,” senior Katharine Chute said.
“Obviously it wasn’t just me,” Dempsey added. “We did it together as a team this weekend.”
Bellamy had 20 saves for the day.
“It was nothing different [than what she usually does],” Dempsey said of her performance.
Liza Ryabkina scored Harvard’s other goal on a power play 11:23 into the second period, putting the Crimson up, 1-0.
St. Lawrence responded when Lauren Brozowski scored on a power play 16:31 into the same period to tie the game at 1-1. The Saints struck again with 40 seconds to go in the period, taking a very brief lead until Pucci was able to tie the game again.
While Harvard and St. Lawrence registered a total of 13 shots in the third period, neither was able to break through its opponents’ defenses, forcing the game into overtime.
Finally, after nearly five minutes of overtime, Dempsey broke the stalemate and scored the winning goal to give Harvard its 14th win of the year.
The win helped the Crimson maintain its hold on second place in the ECAC, just ahead of third-place Dartmouth.
HARVARD 3, CLARKSON 3
While emotions were very positive after Saturday’s win over the Saints, the Crimson left unsatisfied with its last weekend on the road after a 2-2 tie against Clarkson on Friday.
Coming off of a shoot-out win in the Beanpot over Northeastern, Harvard knew what it was in for heading to Cheel Arena to take on the Golden Knights on Friday afternoon, as Clarkson had just tied Cornell—a team that beat the Crimson 3-0 earlier in the season.
“We’re a little bit disappointed with the tie against Clarkson,” Dempsey said.
Harvard was down twice on Friday, but it fought back both times.
The most critical part of the game for the Crimson came after the Golden Knights’ Melissa Waldie’s goal just 1:52 into the third period put Clarkson up 3-2. Harvard was able to keep up the pressure, and Dempsey scored two minutes later to tie the game.
The Golden Knights struck first, when Hailey Wood scored on a power play, putting Clarkson up with 2:18 to go in the first period.
Dempsey would retaliate 10:14 into the second period. Two minutes later, freshman Elizabeth Parker scored to briefly put the Crimson up, 2-1, 12:31 into the second period.
This lead was lost when Jamie Lee Rattray scored 13 minutes into the second period. Despite outshooting the Golden Knights, 19-4, in the second frame, Harvard only outscored Clarkson by one in the period, and the two teams finished the second period tied at two goals apiece.
The Crimson’s inability to capitalize on its shot advantage proved costly, when Waldie was able to score in a big moment in the third period, not long before Dempsey scored the game-tying goal.
“We played a pretty strong game,” Chute said, though she did echo Dempsey’s disappointment with the inability to pick up a win.
Dempsey said she believes that the team’s three straight overtime games are giving it momentum.
Heading into a Beanpot final matchup tomorrow night with Boston College, who beat Harvard, 6-2, earlier in the year, the Crimson certainly does not seem afraid.
“We can fight back, so don’t count us out,” Dempsey said.
“Playing in overtime will be great preparation for Tuesday,” Chute added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three was the magic number for the Harvard men’s volleyball team (5-1), which swept Stevens (8-3, 1-1 UVC) in three sets Saturday at the Malkin Athletic Center by the score of 25-23, 25-22, and 27-25. The win continued the Crimson’s  best start since 2004.
“It was our best match of the year,” Harvard coach Brian Baise said. “We did all the little things in terms of defense. I thought it was our smartest match and most composed match.”
The Ducks carried the momentum late in the third set, coming back from five down to tie the game at 22. On the next point, Stevens capitalized on a hitting error from Harvard to take a 23-22 lead.
With the game on the line, the Crimson went to junior captain Matt Jones, and he delivered by crushing a spike to tie the game at 23. A blocking error from Harvard resulted in game point for the Ducks, but Jones floated a point to save the set at 24-all.
A kill from Stevens senior SteFan PremDas—who tallied a game-high 16 kills—gave the Ducks back the lead at 25-24. But Jones responded with two powerful kills on the outside to regain match point, and he then sealed the contest with an ace.
“It was a good effort all around,” Jones said. “We had some clutch transition swings, and we were able to get some serves in, and fortunately the other guy missed the pass at the end.”
“[Jones has] done that a lot this season,” Baise added. “We made some hitting errors to let them get back in it, but when it got tight at the end, we’re always looking for Matt. He came up today like he has before. You need guys like that on the team, and that can make the difference between a win and a loss...we’re lucky to have him.”
The two teams started the first set trading points. Stevens jumped to a 4-2 lead with two strong kills, but the Crimson tied it up thanks to two consecutive errors from the Ducks.
The lengthiness of Stevens’s front row troubled Harvard early, but as the set progressed, the defense solidified as the Crimson dove for one ball after another to take a 13-12 lead.
“Our backcourt defense was much better than it has been in previous matches,” Jones said. “[Stevens] had some good hitters, and we were able to slow the ball down on their hits.”
With the score tied at 23 all, Harvard rallied to take two straight points, including an ace at game point to take the first set, 25-23.
“We served well,” Baise said, “especially [freshman] Kyle [Rehkemper] at the end of game one.”
The Ducks came out strong in the second set, taking an early 3-1 lead and preserving it late into the frame.
But with the set on the line, the Crimson capitalized on three consecutive Stevens errors to regain a 21-20 lead. Two straight kills from Jones and freshman Chris Gibbons set the score at 23-21, and the Ducks could only muster one more point as the Crimson went on to take the set, 25-22.
The visiting team had another strong start, jumping out to a 5-2 lead in the third game thanks to several Harvard hitting errors. But the Crimson responded with a strong service game that gave Harvard a 19-15 lead. The Ducks rallied late to make it 23-22, but Jones’ clutch performance sealed the match for the Crimson.
“We struggled a bit in that third game, and all the matches we’ve won, we’ve lost the third set,” Baise said. “Tonight was close—we’re up, 20-17, and next thing [we knew] it was 23-all. We need to continue to work on our passing; we were a little better tonight and that really helped our offense.”
Sophomore Rob Lothman paced the offense with 34 assists. Freshman Gibbons led all rookies with nine kills, and classmates Rehkemper and Nick Madden followed suit, each posting seven kills.
“We’ve talked about four freshmen starting, and you don’t know what to expect,” Baise said. “You have high hopes for them, but I’m not totally surprised. I think it’s a great group. It was a long season last year, and the returning guys are determined to change some things. We have some great athleticism, and we’re starting to play as a team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With a short week of practice and players not in full health, the No. 46 Harvard women’s tennis team (2-3) was unable to pull out a win against the No. 71 Maryland Terrapins (5-1) yesterday afternoon, falling 6-1.
“Coming into the match today, quite a few girls on the team were not feeling very well, so we knew that it would be a tough match.  We expected to fight for every single point,” Crimson junior co-captain Holly Cao said.
Fight is exactly what the Harvard squad did, going neck-and-neck with Maryland beginning in doubles. The Terps struck first with an 8-3 win on the No. 1 court. But soon after, Harvard freshman Natalie Blosser finished the doubles match on the No. 2 court with an ace, giving her and her partner, Cao, the win.
On the No. 3 court, things started off not looking very positive for co-captain Samantha Rosekranz and freshman Hannah Morrill, who fought back from a 7-4 deficit to knot the set at seven games each.
In the next game, Rosekranz and Morrill started off strong with a 40-0 lead, but after grueling back-to-back rallies, the Terps ended up earning the game point, putting them ahead, 8-7. Maryland took the last game, giving it the win on the No. 3 court and the doubles point.
In singles, Cao clinched the first win, beating her opponent, 6-4, 6-3, on the No. 1 court. Her last game went into a deuce, but Cao returned a hard shot past the Terps freshman Jordaan Sanford for the win.
Cao’s victory was  the only point the Crimson would tally against Maryland the whole match.
Sophomore Hideko Tachibana dropped her match, 6-4, 6-4, on the No. 2 court.
Harvard junior Samantha Gridley rebounded from a 6-2 loss in her first set to a 6-0 win in her second, but her 6-1 loss in the final set on the No. 6 court moved the Terps another point ahead of the Crimson.
Harvard’s last hopes were washed away with a three-set match lost on the No. 3 court by sophomore Kristin Norton.
Norton won her first set, 6-4, but Maryland junior Cristina Sanchez-Quintanar proved to be persistent and came back to win the next two sets, 6-4, 6-1, to give the Terps their fourth overall point and the win.
Even with no chance for their team’s victory, the Crimson’s last two singles players did not give up.
“I’m really proud of our team and the way they fought out there today,” Harvard coach Traci Green said. “We don’t give ourselves excuses, but we just went out there, fought hard, and did the best we could today.”
After not winning a single game in the first set on the No. 5 court, Rosekrans persevered to win her second set, 6-3, but the Terps came out on top again, winning, 6-4.
In the longest match of the day, Blosser put up a hard fight on the No. 4 court. Blosser won the second set, 7-5, after losing the first, but in the end Maryland senior Julia Huschke managed to win the final set, 6-3.
“We were fighting through a lot of emotions with our energy level, but overall I think we pretty much won,” Green said. “Unfortunately the score didn’t go our way, but I think we won the mental battle out there.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you haven’t been paying attention to men’s tennis, this might be the time to start.
After losing two out of its three matches last weekend, the Harvard men’s tennis team thrashed its opponents on Friday at the Murr Tennis Center. The Crimson swept both of its opponents easily, starting out the weekend with a 5-2 victory over Davidson and finishing it off with a 7-0 rout over Quinnipiac. The victory was Harvard’s third win in a row, putting the squad at 4-3 for the season.
HARVARD 7, QUINNIPIAC 0
The final score might imply that the win came easily, but that was not the case—at least not in the doubles. Although the Crimson pulled through in all three doubles matches, two came down to the end and could have fallen either way. Sophomore Will MacNamee and junior Davis Mangham pulled out a marathon 9-8 victory, and the duo of co-captain Aba Omodele-Lucien and freshman John Thornton gutted out a tough 8-6 match.
Harvard then came out and dominated in the singles. The Crimson won five out of six matches in straight sets, losing a total of just seventeen games. Mangham cruised through the first set and then bagelled his opponent in the second to wrap things up quickly, earning another point for Harvard.
Freshman Brendan Seaver progressed through his match in a similar fashion in his first match of the weekend, winning 6-1, 6-2. Junior Mac McAnulty, playing No. 4, also earned another point for his team in straight sets, 6-3, 6-2.
I’ve definitely worked hard and think I’ve improved over the last couple of weeks,” Seaver said. “I’ve been working with [coach] Dave [Fish ‘72] to improve on some of my weaknesses.”
Most of the Crimson players had an easy time in their matches, but Thornton toughed out a long three-setter against James Kwei to complete the sweep over the Bobcats.
The two traded the opening sets. Thornton, playing No. 3 for Harvard, won the first set, 6-3, but Kwei turned the match around with a second-set win by the same score. Thornton finally managed to pull out the longest match of the night, 10-8 in the third.
HARVARD 5, DAVIDSON 2
Harvard got things started off in a similar fashion against the Wildcats with victories in all three of the doubles matches, getting the squad out to an early lead. The duos of junior Alistair Felton and sophomore Andy Nguyen and freshman Casey MacMaster and junior Jonathan Pearlman each toughed out 8-6 wins. Omodele-Lucien and Tchan progressed through their matchup much more easily with an 8-3 victory over their opponents from Davidson.
For the singles, the Crimson picked up four out of the six victories, but two of the victories did not come easily. In the No. 1 position Pearlman fell to Joe Schafer, in the first set, 6-3. But the junior came out firing in the second set and emerged the winner, taking the next two sets, 6-3, 6-3.
“He was a serve and volley player, so in the second set, I made a lot of returns and hit the ball low,” Pearlman said. “I served a lot better in the second two sets, so I was able to hold serve and break him twice...that’s how I was able to come back.”
Felton seemed like he was going to roll through his match when he won the first set, 6-2. But in the second set, his opponent turned the tables on Felton, evening the match at one set apiece. The third set was a battle, but Felton managed to pull out the victory in the end, 6-4, to give Harvard another point against the Wildcats.
Omodele-Lucien and MacMaster were the other two winners of the afternoon. Omodele-Lucien defeated Arie Hefter, conceding only five games, and MacMaster beat out Kevin Moore in straight sets, 6-3, 6-4.
Harvard is picking up its play at the right moment of the season and improving as the matchups progress. If the Crimson can continue the play that has been showcased lately, the squad just may be able to accomplish its goal of an Ivy League Championship.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just when it looked like the Harvard wrestling squad could turn its season around, the team followed up its victory last weekend with a string of losses.
The Crimson (2-13, 1-2 Ivy) went 0-for-3 this weekend, failing to build momentum after last Saturday’s win over Princeton. Harvard was defeated, 25-18, at Boston University (10-5-1) on Friday and then lost back-to-back matches against Brown (1-7, 1-2) and Hofstra (11-4-1) on Saturday afternoon at the Malkin Athletic Center, 24-17 and 39-8, respectively.
HOFSTRA 39, HARVARD 8
Harvard ended the weekend with its third loss, going down to Hofstra after tying the squad last year, 20-20. Despite the loss, two of the Crimson standouts, co-captain Andrew Knapp and sophomore co-captain Walter Peppelman, picked up wins in the contest.
Peppelman showed no signs of stopping in his matchup against Matt Spataro, cleaning up, 18-0. The Harvard wrestler earned four near falls in the first two periods, taking the lead, 14-0. Peppelman continued his dominance and closed out the win with a technical fall for the Crimson’s first win of the dual.
By the time Knapp stepped out onto the mat, Harvard was already assured a team loss against the Pride, but that did not stop him from giving it his all against Paul Snyder. After the first period, the two were scoreless, but they traded escapes at the beginning of the second and third periods to stay tied, 1-1.
After three periods, the match was tied and went into overtime. The two were even throughout most of the period, but with only 20 seconds left in overtime, Knapp went on the attack. He took down his opponent with only 16 seconds left to win, 3-1.
“We had basically been tying up the whole time,” Knapp said. “I was trying to slide by him...but then he took a bad shot. Actually the take down was kind of a reaction shot...it was a great way to end it.”
BROWN 24, HARVARD 17
The match against Brown was much closer, but the Crimson still could not pull out a win, dropping the matchup to the Bears for the third time in three seasons.
Sophomore Steven Keith put Harvard out in an early lead with three points. Keith remained on top for the entire three rounds, dominating his opponent at 125 pounds. The performance was a reversal of Keith’s two losses last weekend against opponents from Penn and Princeton.
After Peppelman picked up another win for the Crimson, freshman Cameron Croy won Harvard’s third matchup at 184 lbs. He and his opponent remained scoreless for the first period, but Croy earned a quick escape and a takedown to go up, 3-0. Despite the victory for Croy, the Crimson remained down to Brown, 24-11.
Right after Croy stepped off the mat, junior Bryan Panzano continued Harvard’s win streak with a dominating performance over Brandon Shull. He quickly gained the lead with one point, and then earned a takedown and a reversal to further extend his lead. Panzano finished off the matchup with a 5-1 win and gave a fist pump to his supporters in the crowd at end of the match.
“When it goes your way it’s really a great feeling,” Panzano said, “So that was sort of the fist pump, I think, and acknowledging all of the people who were rooting for me along the way.”
BOSTON UNIVERSITY 25, HARVARD 18
The Crimson won five of the ten matches against Boston University, but the effort just wasn’t enough to pull it through the matchup.
Freshman Joseph Marino picked up his sole victory of the weekend on Friday with an 8-0 major decision over Jordan Frease, giving Harvard the lead. Sophomore Adam Hogue also picked up a decision to extend the Crimson’s lead, but Harvard lost the next three matchups to lose the dual.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard ski team first broke free from its usual double-digit finish at the 2009 Eastern Intercollegiate Ski Association championships, coming in ninth place. Nothing has changed ever since, as the Crimson has been stuck in at the same spot for 11 straight carnivals.
The Dartmouth Winter Carnival this past weekend in Hanover, N.H. was more of the same, and the Harvard squad found itself in ninth place, sandwiched between two Saints—just ahead of St. Michael’s and behind St. Lawrence.
The Big Green—the only other Ivy League school competing—finished second, behind the University of Vermont.
In specific events at the meet, the Crimson earned two seventh-place team finishes—one in the women’s giant slalom and the other in the women’s 15k classic mass start.
Harvard also got eighth-place finishes in the women’s 5k freestyle, the women’s slalom, and the men’s 20k mass start.
“Overall, there were a lot of positives,” freshman Rebecca Nadler said. “Hopefully we can keep building.”
For the second straight weekend, sophomore Catherine Sheils posted the Crimson’s top individual finish, this time with an 11th-place result in the women’s slalom. Sheils ended only .07 seconds behind 10th-place finisher Laura Rozinowicz from the University of New Hampshire.
Rozinowicz used a strong second run to propel herself past Sheils and into the top 10.
Sheils’ consistency allowed her to stay ahead of 12th-place finisher Lyndee Janowiak from the University of Vermont. Janowiak posted a stronger second run than Sheils did, but the Harvard skier’s first run was enough to keep her ahead.
“[It] was really great that she could get that consistency,” Nadler said. “She’s skiing really, really well. I think she was pretty happy. We were [also] really happy about her result.”
The Crimson’s other top individual finishes came from sophomore Alena Tofte and Nadler.
Tofte, Harvard’s most consistent racer this past weekend, took 16th in both the 5k freestyle and the 15k classic mass start. Nadler posted the same result in the giant slalom.
“I would’ve liked to do a little better,” Nadler said of her result. “It wasn’t a bad result, but I know I can do better.”
Tofte earned her 16th-place finishes by tiny margins. In the 5k, she defeated Williams’ Sarah Tory by .1 second, and in the 15k, she topped UNH’s Kathryn Williams by .4 seconds.
“She came into the stadium [at the end of the course] even with [Williams] and double-poled ahead of her over the last few yards,” said Nordic coach Chris City ’94.
Junior Kevin McNamara and freshman Ian Anderson were the top finishers for the men’s alpine team. McNamara took 35th in the giant slalom, and Anderson earned a 41st-place finish in the slalom.
Rookie Chris Stock, who finished in 31st place in the 20k classic mass start, and sophomore Tony Ryerson, who took 32nd in the men’s 10k freestyle, led the way for the men’s Nordic team.
City was impressed with his athletes’ ability to adapt to Dartmouth’s challenging course.
“Last year the Dartmouth carnival got moved to Stowe. Many of my skiers are freshmen and sophomores,” City said. “They hadn’t seen the course before—it’s a pretty intimidating course. It’s got a very steep and long climb...People didn’t get intimidated.”
And while the men’s team didn’t have anyone scoring as high as Tofte, City was impressed with the depth the team demonstrated this past weekend, especially in the 20k.
“Kevin Sprague had his best race of the season [on Saturday],” City said. “I think it was his first time scoring points for us this season. He just skied really well. [Freshman] Tanner [Wiegand] had a good day. That was one of Tony’s best classic races...The guys are starting to come around.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Undefeated since February of 2009, the Harvard women’s squash team looked like the best team in the country. The Crimson’s easy 7-2 win over No. 3 Trinity on Wednesday seemed to cement that status.
But that all changed Saturday afternoon.
In a tightly contested Ivy League Championship match, No. 1 Harvard (9-1, 5-1 Ivy) fell to No. 2 Yale (14-0, 5-0) at the Barnaby Courts, 5-4.
“It was a close, competitive match,” sophomore Laura Gemmell said. “Our team played well…[but] we just ended up losing.”
Both teams came into the encounter sporting undefeated records and three players ranked in the top 10 nationally.
“[Yale has] a lot of depth and really talented players,” Gemmell said.
The first round of matches didn’t bode well for the Crimson. After senior No. 9 Alexandra Zindman lost 3-0, captain No. 3 Alisha Mashruwala followed suit, also failing to win a game. Though the senior took the lead at the beginning of the third set, Bulldog Sarah Toomey staged a mini-comeback of her own to close out another victory for Yale.
“[Toomey] played very well, [and] I have to respect her,” said Mashruwala. “She probably played the best squash of her life. I wish I were more consistent.”
But Harvard escaped with a win in the first three matches thanks to junior No. 6 Cece Cortes, who overwhelmed her Bulldog counterpart, 11-1, 11-6, 11-2.
In the next round of contests, junior No. 2 Nirasha Guruge faltered in the first game, 12-10, but then began the next set with a 5-1 lead. Frustration with let calls mounted, and she lost consecutive points after an unforced error on a return of serve, catalyzing a 12-10, 11-7, 11-7 loss at the hands of Millie Tomlinson.
“[Tomlinson is] a very well-known [player]…[with] a lot of experience,” Gemmell said.
Meanwhile, sophomore No. 5 Natasha Kingshott emerged victorious in a tense match. In the second set, Kingshott was up, 8-5, before opponent Rhetta Nadas leveled the score at 10-10. Nadas and Kingshott went back and forth, until Kingshott hit an unforced error that sailed over the back glass, causing her to lose the set, 19-17.
But Kingshott quickly bounced back, winning the first four points of the third set en route to a 11-6, 19-17, 11-5, 11-3 victory that left Nadas furiously storming off the court.
“[After she lost the second game], Natasha took it as a fighting opportunity,” said Mashruwala. “She regained her focus and played really well the rest of the match.”
On the other court, senior No. 8 Bethan Williams gave the Crimson its second win of the day, dropping a close first set, 10-12, before posting three consecutive wins, 11-3, 11-5, 11-6.
Going into the final three matches, the score was tied 3-3, with senior No 4. June Tiong, sophomore No 7. Sarah Mumanachit, and last year’s national champion, sophomore No.1 Laura Gemmell, still left to play for Harvard.
Because of her consistent strategic ball placement right over the lower red line, Gemmell easily took care of Yale’s Logan Greer, 3-0, giving the Crimson a 4-3 lead. The sophomore has yet to lose a match in her collegiate career.
Tiong fought hard in the first set of the match but still lost, 11-9. She recuperated quickly and jumped out to a 5-0 lead, only to fall 12-10 in the second set and 11-3 in the third.
“June played someone with very good hands, and it’s hard when someone is on a roll,” said Mashruwala.
Simultaneously, Harvard’s Mumanachit was having a battle against the Bulldogs’ Caroline Reigeluth.
The closest match of the day became responsible for determining the Ivy League champion.
Mumanachit won the first game, 11-6, then lost the next two by scores of 11-7, 11-6, respectively.
The sophomore came roaring back to settle the score at 2-2 with one game left to play. Though down early in the final set, 10-4, she made it close, tallying three unanswered points. But in the end, her efforts fell short, as she dived across the floor and missed the final shot to give Yale the victory.
“Just watching June and Sarah, I know they felt pressure to win,” Gemmell said of the day’s final two bouts. “I was really proud of the way they played.”
“Sarah is one of our most consistent players, [and] I give her a lot of credit,” added Mashruwala. “She has a lot of courage, and tried her best and played her heart out.”
But in the end, a loss is a loss.
“I mean it’s upsetting of course, that we weren’t able to pull out a win,” Mashruwala said. “But everyone played with all of their hearts, and that’s what is most important. Win or lose, they did an amazing job.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 6 Harvard men’s squash team entered its last match of the regular season against the No. 2 Yale Bulldogs hoping to repeat its strong performance that it showed against an undefeated Trinity team last Wednesday.
The Crimson (7-5, 3-3 Ivy) only took two matches from the Bulldogs (13-1, 6-0 Ivy), with the day ending in a 7-2 victory for Yale. The Bulldogs also went home with their second consecutive Ivy League championship title.
“As you could see it was a tough match,” Harvard coach Mike Way said. “We knew that we were up against the strongest team and that showed today.”
Last year, the Bulldogs overpowered Harvard, 8-1, in the final match of the season to earn the Ivy title.
Despite the loss, the Crimson left Barnaby Courts Saturday on a positive note after freshman and No. 1 Gary Power defeated his opponent in an extremely close and exciting fifth set. The victory gave Harvard its second individual win of the day.
Power, who had one of the three impressive victories in last Wednesday’s match against Trinity, took an early 3-0 lead in his first set and went on to win, 11-6.
The tables were turned in the second set when Power’s opponent took an early five-point lead. The freshman was unable to make a comeback, losing the set, 11-8.
Tied one set apiece, the third set played out similarly to the second, with Power again falling into an early 5-1 hole from which he was unable to recover. He lost, 11-7.
In the fourth set, Power came back, winning 11-8 and tying the match at two sets apiece.
At that point, it was anyone’s game, and Power made it his, quickly grabbing a 4-0 lead in the fifth set.
But his opponent battled hard, eventually tying the score, 9-9.
Power won the next point and was only one away from victory when his opponent scored twice in a row, going ahead, 11-10.
Just when it looked like it was all over, Power fought back to win the next two points, setting the score at 12-11. He was once again a single point away from success.
The crowd held its breath as the two players battled relentlessly in a rally that seemed to go on forever.
Then, with a quick stroke of his racquet, Power took the next and final point, winning the fifth set, 13-11, and the match, 3-2.
Though the team suffered a loss overall, Power’s victory helped his fellow teammates to finish the season motivated for the upcoming CSA national championships.
“I think Gary’s win here should really get the guys sparked and galvanized and ready to go,” said freshman Thomas Mullaney, who plays for the Crimson in the No. 7 position.
Mullaney provided Harvard with its first individual victory of the day, beating his opponent in just three sets.
The freshman comfortably won his first set, 11-7, after gaining an early lead. The second set proved to be closer, and, though at one point the score was close, 9-8, Mullaney was able to hold onto his lead once again, winning 11-8.
The real battle for Mullaney was the third set in which he quickly found himself in a 7-4 hole.
But, working hard to power through and grab another victory, he came back to score seven of the next eight points to ultimately win the set, 11-8, and the match, 3-0.
Saturday’s game marked the last home match for captain Reed Endresen and fellow seniors Richard Hill, Eliot Buchanan, and Quentin Auerbach.
“The guys fought valiantly,” Way said. “We’re going to build on this. We’re going to [make] ourselves better in two weeks time for the national finals weekend.”
Though both of Saturday’s victories came from freshmen, the team still owes a great deal of its motivation and success to its senior leadership. Endresen is one of those seniors who has shown perseverance to the underclassman, starting out in the No. 5 spot but moved up to No. 2 shortly after winter break.
“If you want to get better you just have to work hard,” Power said. “[Reed] a good example to everyone.”
“I’ve got nothing but my praise for my captain,” Way said. “He’s done a stellar job. They’ll be big shoes to fill. I’m very proud of him.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men and women’s track teams closed out their regular season this weekend, taking to the track against Ancient Eight foes Princeton and Yale on Saturday at the HYP meet in New Haven, Conn.
Despite coming off impressive showings at the Beantown Invitational on Feb. 4, the Crimson could not improve upon last year’s pair of second-place HYP finishes, as the Tigers took first on both the men’s and women’s side.
Princeton continued its strong season, racking up victories on both sides, to post totals of 114 points for the men and 90.5 points for the women, in comparison to Harvard’s 36 and 41.5 for the men’s and women’s sides, respectively.
“We went out and gave a good effort, but Princeton brought their game,” captain Claire Richardson said. “The Tigers are always tough competitors, and we really wanted to beat them and make them uncomfortable on top of the Ivies. We did our best, but we still have a ways to go.”
Nevertheless, Crimson coach Jason Saretsky seemed pleased with the result.
“The team took a big step forward in preparation for the Championships in two weeks,” Saretsky said.
Despite the disappointing overall result, Harvard’s weekend was punctuated by impressive performances by a talented class of freshmen, led by former Ivy Rookies of the Week Dustin Brode on the men’s side and Christina Twicken on the women’s side.
In the HYP meet, Brode placed second in the shot put with a throw of 16.81 meters, nearing his personal best of 17.00. Twicken, along with fellow freshman Meisha Brooks, led a 1-2 finish in the women’s 400, crossing the line in 56.69. The two would team up again later in the day, with juniors Magda Roback and Shannon Conway, to win the 4x400 in 3:46.10.
Freshman Alysha Johnson joined the party, placing second in the women’s shot put with a throw of 14.32 meters, a personal best that Saretsky called “a standout performance.”
Sophomore teammate Shannon Watt followed Johnson in second. Back on the men’s side, freshman Kobi Rex tied for second in the high jump at 1.94 meters.
“I feel like everyone is in the same mind set. We’re all working hard, and hoping it will pay off in two weeks,” Johnson said.
The performances of the freshmen this weekend also earned the respect of their upperclassmen teammates.
“The freshmen class works really hard,” Richardson said. “The team loves them, they fit in and put up results on the track. It’s definitely great to have them with the program.”
Sophomore Mary Hirst won the women’s high jump with a jump of 1.60 meters while classmate Oliva Weekes placed second in the triple jump (11.52m) and third in the long jump (5.47m) to continue a successful season. Claire Richardson took second in the 3000 with a time of 9:39.08 to close out the day.
Youth might have been a recurring theme, but Harvard’s upperclassmen were sure to represent the Crimson on the podium as well.
Seniors led the way for the Crimson men as senior Ablorde Ashigbe joined fellow thrower Brode to come in second in the weighted throw with a distance of 17.70 meters.
Senior distance runner Dan Chenoweth placed second in the men’s 3000 (8:11.16) and third in the mile (4:09.42), while classmate Brian Hill proved to be a dominant force in the middle distance events.
Hill won the 500 in 1:03.75 and ran the first leg for Harvard’s 4x800 winning relay team.
This weekend’s results affirmed Princeton’s position as the odds-on favorite in the Ivies, but the individual successes of some of the Crimson did well to boost the confidence of a young team.
“That personal best meant a lot to me, and I’m very excited about that throw,” Johnson said. “There were a lot of personal bests this weekend, and it really shows the progression we’ve made through this indoor season.”
The Crimson will be off this coming weekend as it trains up for the Heptagonal Championships in New York City at the end of the month.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sixteen seconds, four touches, one Ivy League champion.
In the final bout of the Ivy League tournament, Crimson freshman and épée specialist Michael Raynis scored the final point against Peter Cohen to break the tie and top rival Yale, 14-13.
The crucial win clinched the Ivy League title for the Harvard men’ fencing team for the seventh time overall and first time since 2007.
“It came down to the last round and the last match, and tied in bouts, 4-4, Michael Raynis came through big time for us with the last touch,” Harvard coach Peter Brand said.
On the way to the Ancient Eight title, the Crimson men defeated seventh-ranked Penn, 16-11, and No. 6 Princeton, 17-10, to take the early tournament lead after the first day of competition.
On the second day, Harvard continued its unbeaten streak by defeating Brown, 22-5, No. 8 Columbia, 18-9, and Yale in nail-biting fashion to go 5-0 for the day.
In addition to the Ivy title, six Harvard fencers—junior co-captain Valentin Staller, junior James Hawrot, sophomores Thomas Kolasa, Raynis and Ben Whit, freshman Eric Arzoian—were recognized for their individual efforts and earned All-Ivy honors.
Of the six, Thomas Kolasa and Michael Raynis were named to the All-Ivy first team after finishing the weekend 13-2, and 12-3, respectively.
The biggest surprise coming out of the tournament was the performance of the Bulldogs throughout the weekend.
“We had a major hurdle to overcome with Yale,” Brand said. “I got to hand it to Yale. They came out of nowhere to give us a real challenge.”
“Even though they were ranked pretty low in all of the polls, they just came out like gangbusters and were undefeated, just like us, up until the final round,” Brand added.
Nevertheless, the hard-fought final match between the two rivals only made the victory sweeter for the Crimson.
On the women’s side, despite falling short of the league crown, the team gave an inspiring performance for the weekend.
In the first day of the competition, the No. 3 Harvard women’s fencing team defeated No. 8 Penn, 14-13, and dominated Cornell, 23-4, before narrowly falling to host No. 4 Princeton, 15-12.
On the second day, the Crimson women defeated Brown, 23-4, and rival Yale, 17-10, before losing to No. 6 Columbia, 15-12, to wrap up the competition.
By weekend’s end, the Tigers had successfully defended its 2010 title with a perfect 6-0 record for its first back-to-back titles, while Harvard finished in third with a record of 4-2.
“It was a bit frustrating losing to Princeton,” said junior co-captain and sabre specialist Caroline Vloka. “Unfortunately, we lost to them by a small margin, but the frustration only lasted for a few minutes after the loss. Everyone then gathered their composure because we still had three more schools to fence.”
Leading the women’s squad for the weekend were Vloka and freshman Alexandra Kiefer, who both earned first team All-Ivy League honors for their performances in the saber and foil, respectively.
Vloka went 16-2 over the two-day event to gain a share of the saber individual title, while Kiefer boasted a 15-3 record to finish second in the foil standings.
With the Ivy League Championships behind the Crimson, both the men’s and women’s squads now set their sights on the Beanpot—to be held Wednesday—and then the NCAA Regionals and NCAA Championships.
With these crucial matches in the upcoming weeks, both Harvard squads team will have to put their best foots forward as they square off against nationally ranked teams.
But for now, the Crimson men can bask in the glow of their Ivy crown before both Harvard squads gear up for a national-title push.
“We hope to qualify as many people as possible during the NCAA regionals in Vassar, so we’ve got some work ahead of us,” Brand said. “Our team though is well-prepared and motivated, so I anticipate some good results coming for us going forward.”

It’s Sunday brunch. You press your golden brown verritaffle, grab some coffee, and plop down next to your blockmates. The inevitable topic at hand, of course, is on the romantic successes and failures of the previous night.
Frustrated with the unsatisfying and overall disappointing nature of Harvard’s romance scene, a new blog titled Veritas Waffles was created to give the women of Harvard a new outlet for post-walk-of-shame frustrations: each other.
Founded early last week by Adams resident Jillian K. Kushner '12, an inactive Crimson editor, the blog allows women to lament, vent, and question the complicated nature of college relationships. As the days of courtship and chivalry have been replaced with hookups and head nods, women now have, according to Kushner, a place to share romantic "issues unique to Harvard, unique to our age as college-age women, and unique to our generation."
"Veritas Waffles is a way for Harvard women to anonymously share stories and engage in discussion about the Harvard dating scene," Kushner said. "It’s dating for intelligent women."
Kushner is currently co-authoring a book about the nature of romance for young women at high stress institutions like Harvard.
The posts on Veritas Waffles range from angry to confused to inspiring. The site assumes that the best sources of advice when it comes to dating at Harvard are other Harvard women. After anonymously posting romantic woes, the writer can receive feedback from women of all walks of romantic life at Harvard.
Whether women post personal stories, respond to others, or just read for comfort and entertainment, the new blog reminds girls that they aren’t alone. In short, the website affirms: "don’t worry … we’ve all been there, girl."

This post has been revised to reflect the following clarification.
CLARIFICATION: FEB. 15, 2011
The Feb. 14 Flyby post "'We've All Been There, Girl'" failed to note that Jillian K. Kushner '12 is an inactive Crimson editor.

Curious Leverett House members were able to learn about an array of edible aphrodisiacs this Sunday, just in time for Valentine’s Day. The Food Literacy Project and the Health and Wellness Center teamed up to put on a study break to showcase what types of food can put you in the mood for loving.
The organizers of the study break showcased whipped cream, bananas, sliced pineapple, guacamole, slabs of chili chocolate, and strawberries as examples of aphrodisiac food. As Leverett House members sampled from the delectable treats, Sarah G. Bakst '11, a member of the Food Literacy Project, repeatedly asked those in attendance to ask about each food’s mood-enhancing qualities.
House members left with a new sense of how some everyday foods can stimulate their minds and bodies. Whether some of the foods actually have aphrodisiac qualities, promote sensual thinking through association, or simply taste good, many students came out of the study break with their moods improved.
"It makes people happy, that's the important thing," Bakst said.
While handing out condoms to students as they passed by, Bakst and Elena P. Lisitskaya, Leverett House's health and wellness tutor, provided a final takeaway on the association of aphrodisiacs with mental and physical health.
"You should feel happy about getting it on," they said, "but do it safely."

The Graduate School of Education might want to consider adding animal self-defense to the course catalog. When Anjali Adukia traveled to India to retrieve data for her dissertation at the GSE, she never expected to have her intellectual property (physically) stolen by a furry animal, or by a cute kid in a costume, for that matter. Her escapade was reenacted by the GSE's magazine here. 
 
According to the producer and the director of the video, Matthew Weber, the video has been the GSE's most popular video yet. After Weber heard about the story, he scouted locations for the reenactment. 
"[I walked] around Cambridge looking for a place that looks like India is tough," he said, eventually setting on JFK Park.
 
After Adukia spent over a year trying to retrieve collected data on Indian schools, she decided to visit the organization in India. After a week of practically camping out at the organization, her efforts were rewarded, and she received a DVD with the data on it. 
 
What happened next involves: a monkey, a banana, and a bit of violence (the GSE claims that no monkeys or little boys were hurt in the making of the film). 
"It sounds so unbelievably crazy it sounds like it is not true. But it is," Weber said.
