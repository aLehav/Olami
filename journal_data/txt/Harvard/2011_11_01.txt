A diabolical yet strikingly charming smile appears on Iago’s (Phil M. Gillen ’13) face as he initiates his first wicked twist in the plot of one of Shakespeare’s most celebrated tragedies: “Your daughter and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs,” he says.
The mise-en-scène of the Hyperion Shakespeare Company’s production of “Othello,” playing in Farkas Hall—the recently renamed New College Theatre—until November 6, turns out to be all about isolating and amplifying those words, expressions, and moments that define individuals and alter the course of lives. With an unobstrusive technical approach that places the emphasis on a traditional reading of the Bard’s text, director Nathan O. Hilgartner ’14’s “Othello” relies on powerful if sometimes one-dimensional acting to realize the tragedy’s layers of deceit. However, a halfhearted attempt to modernize the production in parallel with minimalist staging distracts more than it contributes to the final product.
The production draws a lot of its dramatic force from the barren set design of Madelynne A. Hays ’13: against a white backdrop and floor, the set consists of five white modular platforms of varying sizes that are rearranged into various configurations over the course of the play to reflect the characteristics of discrete spaces. The choices of costume designer Janet J. Eom ’14 realize the director’s monochromatic vision for the tragedy, as the entire cast of characters are dressed in blazing whites—except for Othello, who wears black from head to toe.
Cast as an outsider from the very beginning, Othello’s dress not only foreshadows his ominous fate, but also designates him as the focal point of the tragedy about to unfold. Color emerges through the use of spotlights and varying atmospheric hues by lighting designer Lora D. Stoianova ’13, additions which remove the necessity for screen panels to create split-scenes. This, in turn, reinforces the dramatic effect of the juxtaposition of events in those divided scenes.
In the title role, Spencer J. Horne ’14 excels at maintaining high energy and composure throughout the play to fuel Othello’s long-winded declarations of anger and exasperation. However, his delivery often lacks nuance as he leads Othello to stylistically static fits of rage. On the other hand, Gillen’s delightfully clear articulation fits well with his overpowering presence on stage. Lit with green-tinted light to emphasize the rottenness of his words, Gillen scintillates in the role of Iago during his soliloquies.
Like Horne’s Othello, however, Gillen’s Iago is less a character than a caricature and leaves the audience wondering whether a real person can be this dark at heart. Still, Gillen manages to charm and disgust in turn, affecting a childlike innocence and incarnating the devil with remarkable integrity of character.
Rachel V. Byrd ’13’s soft-spoken Desdemona deserves praise for her lightness and vulnerability, but she seems not to relish each word as much as other leads do, which diminishes the effect of her pleas to Othello and sometimes reduces her character to a nuisance. In contrast, her maid Emilia (Emily B. Hyman ’13) exhibits a perfect balance of casual mannerisms with classic tragic gestures. She embodies Hilgartner’s ideal for the play on her own—not too high-flown and moralizing, yet acting on a recognizable sense of dignity.
Although much of the production is geared towards modernizing “Othello”—most notably the use of cell phones and pistols—certain flaws tarnish the uniformity of the play. One cannot help but be surprised at seeing a woman wearing a contemporary-looking get-up including tight dress, pearls, and heels get help from her servant to undress. Desdemona’s handkerchief feels similarly out of place given the obsolescence of personal handkerchiefs today, especially when the one in question features garish strawberry prints.
These two examples highlight a greater issue: Hilgartner and his technical staff seem intent on giving “Othello” a contemporary flavor, but the incomplete and jarring nature of their changes demonstrate a lack of ambition in the adaptation. Either a more complete modernization or a retreat towards the more minimal approach the staging suggests might have been more fulfilling. Nevertheless, Hilgartner’s instructions are well received by an astute cast, which makes the most of his vision. As a result, despite its shortcomings, Shakespeare’s tale of malignant distrust and unbridled deceit comes alive in Farkas Hall.

“That’s kind of better.” Lang Lang—the 29-year-old pianist phenomenon who has released over a dozen commercial recordings and was listed in TIME Magazine’s 2009 list of the “100 Most Influential People in the World”—is standing over Tania Rivers-Moore ’15 as she repeats a passage from the first movement of Beethoven’s Sonata in E Major, Op. 109. “For Beethoven, we need more intensity, more struggling,” he says, donned in a lustrous slim-fitting suit that is somehow both blue and purple under the Sanders Theatre lights.
Rivers-Moore was one of three undergraduate students who played for Lang Lang in a master class in Sanders Theatre last Saturday. For these student pianists, the master class was a unique opportunity to play for one of the classical music industry’s preeminent artists.
The class was co-sponsored by the Office for the Arts at Harvard’s (OFA) Learning from Performers program and the Celebrity Series of Boston. The OFA and Celebrity Series have collaborated on programming for several years and have brought a diverse array of artists—from choreographer Mark Morris to actress Audra McDonald—to the Harvard campus. “Through Learning from Performers, we enable artists to be able to talk about the creative process and reflect on their values,” says Amy W. Lam, Artistic Programmer at Celebrity Series.
Lang Lang was a valuable artist to bring to Harvard due to his tremendous commitment to youth musical education through the Lang Lang International Music Foundation. “Lang Lang focuses a lot of time in nurturing talent and has a passion for education,” says Lam. “The Lang Lang foundation is completely devoted to nurturing young talent.”
The pianists chosen to perform for Lang Lang, after being contacted by Music Department faculty to audition for the class, were excited to hear the virtuoso’s thoughts on their own interpretations of selected pieces. Allen Yueh ’13, who performed Franz Liszt’s Sonata in B minor, S. 178, said, “I just want to hear his ideas. I have my own interpretation of it, my own storyline, and I really want to see if he has a different storyline, or something that I could incorporate into my own storyline.” Lang Lang responded positively to Yueh’s playing. “You have very good ideas,” he remarked, as he helped Yueh to produce a more haunting sound. “This is music for scary movies,” he said.
George X. Fu ’13, who performed Sergei Prokofiev’s Sonata No. 7 in B flat, Op. 83, was eager to see how Lang Lang would help him better express his personal interpretation. “Whatever he does, it is very convincing. So while I may not agree with what he does, he manages to sell it so well,” Fu says. “In the end, when you play music, you are just looking for the best way to sell your music, the best way to convey your message. And I think he would help me do that with my piece.”
Rivers-Moore also noted how Lang Lang, known for his larger-than-life stage persona, helped her achieve a more effective performance. “I thought that the master class was particularly valuable because each pianist had such a different stage presence, and such different visions to bring to the table,” she wrote in an email. “This master class permitted me to leave with a less inhibited and more balanced approach to performing.” Fu is the Co-President of the once defunct but now revamped Harvard Piano Society, an organization dedicated to providing new performance and master class opportunities for pianists at the college. The group also serves as an important social venue for players of a “solitary” instrument like the piano, says Fu.
Lang Lang’s master class was a particularly exciting event for participants and spectators alike not only due to the virtuoso’s elite status in the classical music world, but also because it was a unique performance opportunity for undergraduates not affiliated with any student or departmental ensembles. “I think master classes would be a really good way to open the door for individual performances,” says Yueh. “[Lang Lang’s master class is] more a show of sharing, and I think that is what Harvard needs more of.”
Fu, echoing this sentiment, said, “The fact that he is even considering doing a master class here is really just a blessing.”

“I don’t like to defend a person; that’s a passive occupation. I like to judge. I fit right in with your kind of people, dear Inspector,” says The Maniac (Isabel Q. Carey ’12) with ironic relish as she outwits an Italian police inspector. Dario Fo’s dark farce “Accidental Death of an Anarchist” has the potential to deliver strong judgment on police brutality, corruption, and any number of issues depending on a director’s chosen political context. Visiting director Stephen Squibb’s production, replete with dance numbers, slapstick, and drag, chooses a somewhat different but equally satisfying approach. Due to the cast’s impeccable comedic timing, an exceptional performance on Carey’s part, and Squibb’s playful theatricality, the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production of “Accidental Death of an Anarchist”—which runs until November 5 on the Loeb Mainstage—is thoroughly enjoyable despite its halfhearted attempt at a pointed political critique of the financial crisis.
Fo’s Italian farce, published in 1970, is based on the actual death of an accused anarchist, who either fell or was thrown from the fourth-floor window of a Milan police station in 1969. The play opens with the much put-upon Inspector Bertozzo (Georgina B. Parfitt ’13) interrogating Carey’s Maniac. The Maniac discovers that a judge is about to arrive to investigate a similar death and decides to impersonate the judge. In that role, he convinces the police involved in the anarchist’s interrogation to reenact the events leading to the death in the original fourth-floor hotel room.
Squibb has made extensive alterations to the original text, an uncontroversial decision given Fo’s embrace of improvisation and revision, and the production still bears the trademarks of farce. Two gummy worm-eating, bumbling constables (Daniel W. Erickson ’14 and Sam S. Richman ’15) serve as clowns. Unbridled slapstick reigns as characters chase each other around the room. Squibb does not betray the play’s black comedy, but his “Anarchist” is filled with well-executed and entertaining whimsy. Cast members dance while assembling the set themselves, even skipping in a circle, hands linked, after placing down a table. At one point, the ensemble breaks into five-part harmony; elsewhere, they perform an ebullient dance number to Bonnie Tyler’s “Total Eclipse of the Heart.”
Squibb’s revisions are about more than creating an atmosphere of irreverence, however. There is a naked theatricality to his “Anarchist” which is illustrated not only in details such as the simple, undisguised drag of the female actors—unnatural chest padding and long hair merely tied back—but also in the characters’ metatheatrical acknowledgment of the stage. Occasionally Squibb’s theatricality feels excessive, a problem exemplified by an infrequent laugh track that startles to little illumination.
Squibb’s use of the Loeb Mainstage is highly unconventional. Set designer J. Michael Griggs has blocked off nearly half the seating with caution tape and crates. The audience is split into the two sections that face each other and border the linoleum flooring that serves as the stage.  It feels peculiar to be surrounded by a few hundred empty seats but the resulting intimacy with the actors, rarely found in the Mainstage, is highly rewarding given the ensemble’s talent.
Though Carey’s character impersonates a judge, she most closely resembles a conductor, orchestrating the bumbling policemen around her with great subtlety. Carey has an arsenal of entertaining accents and tics at her disposal, but she really shines in conveying the quiet intelligence that belies the Maniac’s eccentricities. Her ability to layer multiple levels of meaning in her speech is showcased when delivering seemingly nonsensical one-liners like “let’s just say you will recognize him when his fist hits your face.”
Squibb’s cast is a cohesive ensemble, whether performing choreography to an ’80s ballad or engaging in swift wordplay. Brianne Holland-Stergar ’13 and Vanessa B. Koo ’12 as Sports Jacket and the Superintendent, respectively, are a perfectly cast pair. Stergar is able to channel the Captain’s stupidity without being cloying, and her dynamic with Koo’s quick temper is hilarious. Erickson’s and Richman’s constables are delightful as the clowns of this farce, but never distract from the main action. Richman and Erickson also deftly handle the play’s otherwise misguided prologue.
The vast majority of the production’s political sentiment is presented in this prologue and the play’s ending, which are bookends to the farce. The reenactment of the anarchist’s interrogation provides some commentary on police brutality, but hardly a damning one. The few attempts to modernize the piece do not culminate in a strong statement. When Koo makes a joke lamenting the arrests of screenwriters, including Diablo Cody of ‘Juno’ fame, it falls flat not due to any fault in Koo’s delivery but due to the lack of expectation for such a topical remark. Though the attempts at modern political commentary fail to jibe with the bulk of the play’s action, the farcical humor is adulterated with thematic import. There are moments that point clearly to police misconduct, and the Maniac’s ability to control the police with nothing more than an authoritative voice and a wrinkled judge’s robe speaks to the power of authority. “Accidental Death of an Anarchist” asks to be taken seriously, but it does so with a gratifying wink.

The surface of a painting is only the beginning of its story. It is what lies beneath the layers of paint—the artistic process—that allows for full understanding of the work. The Artist Documentation Program (ADP), founded in 1990, presents this more subtle facet of artists’ work. The project—a compilation of interviews with notable artists including Jasper Johns, Max Neuhaus, Frank Stella, and Cy Twombly—presents a valuable source of information for conservators and researchers. On October 14, the ADP launched an online archive of their collections, making more than 50 hours of previously unavailable interview footage available to the general public.
The ADP originally began at the Menil Collection, the Houston museum complex that houses the art collection of founders John and Dominique de Menil. The Menil Collection, originally private, opened to the public in the late ’80s. When notified that one of the Collection’s artists would be visiting, Dominique de Menil asked Carol C. Mancusi-Ungaro, then the Menil chief conservator, to bring out the artist’s previous work for viewing. De Menil’s gesture inspired Mancusi-Ungaro to begin asking the artists technical questions about the work at hand.
Reflecting on these early conversations, Mancusi-Ungaro said, “Much to my surprise, artists in general liked to answer these questions. These were decisions they had made. The decisions were very clear to them. They readily answered them—and expounded upon them. So after this happened two or three times, I realized I was getting extraordinary information that my profession did not know.
Before long, Mancusi-Ungaro had attracted the attention of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation for her interview work. After receiving a grant from the foundation to continue the interviews on a larger scale, she formalized her work as the founding director of the ADP. Joining the Whitney Museum of American Art as well as the Harvard Art Museums, Mancusi-Ungaro has expanded the project beyond the artists featured in the Menil Collection.
Not only did Mancusi-Ungaro include more artists in the documentation project, but she also began filming her interviews instead of simply storing voice recordings. The choice of film over audio, she said, “was a deliberate one.” “The real reason for filming was to see the state of the work under discussion at the time of the interview so you could see what we were talking about and eventually assess how that work had aged over time. You would have a reference.”
All of the filmed interviews are accompanied by a subject key that splits lengthy interviews into topic-specific video clips. This indexing, now available on the ADP website, provides historians and curators with a unique resource for efficient primary research.
As the ADP continues to expand, Mancusi-Ungaro is working to strengthen the collaboration between the Menil Collection, the Whitney Museum of American Art, and the Harvard Art Museums. Heather E. Nodler, the project archivist, said, “[We will] evaluate the partnership, define policy parameters, and analyze researchers’ use of the collection. Our goal is to formalize the relationship on a more long-term basis in order to ensure the project’s ongoing sustainability and success.”
As Mancusi-Ungaro describes, the importance of the Artist Documentation Program comes from its ability to track how an artist—and their work—ages. “When an artist finishes a work of art, it is brand new. Then it goes into the world. The artist may not see it for a very long time and works of art change—as people do.”

Lisa Randall ’84, the Frank B. Baird, Jr. Professor of Science, studies theoretical particle physics and cosmology in the Physics Department. One of the most cited theoretical physicists of recent years, Randall has received accolades from the National Academy of Sciences, The American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Physical Society, among others. She is currently on tour for her book “Knocking on Heaven’s Door: How Physics and Scientific Thinking Illuminate the Universe and the Modern World,” which was published in September of this year.
Though Randall’s professional prowess lies in the sciences, she became interested in the arts when she was invited to write the libretto for “Hypermusic Prologue: A Projective Opera in Seven Planes” after Spanish composer Hector Parra read her book “Warped Passages: Unraveling the Mysteries of the Universe’s Hidden Dimensions.” Randall and Harra’s collaboration aimed to project audiences beyond known frontiers of the universe and illuminate the driving forces underlying creativity in art and science. Randall is also the co-curator of the Los Angeles Arts Association exhibition “Measure for Measure,” an exploration of the connection between visual scale and artistic expression. Her exhibition will be shown at the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts from Nov. 3 to Dec. 22.
The Harvard Crimson: When did you first become interested in the relationship between science and art?
Lisa Randall: It is something that sort of grows on you. I have always enjoyed art, probably more than I realized. When I wrote my first book, [“Warped Passages: Unraveling the Universe’s Hidden Dimensions”], a friend of mine who read it said, “You should take an art class,” because I had used so many analogies from art. I do not think there was one moment where [the relationship] suddenly clicked, unless it was when I was invited to write the libretto for the opera [“Hypermusic Prologue: A Projective Opera in Seven Planes”]. I think that was when I realized I might have some actual role to play in the art world.
THC: What kind of previous experience have you had working with art?
LR: Mostly, I have been an observer in terms of art. My first real experience in working with the arts was my involvement with [Hypermusic Prologue]. In addition to writing the libretto, I had the opportunity to work with the artist Matthew Ritchie to help envision how our story could be presented on a stage. There were many challenges in trying to represent an extra-dimensional world [on a stage] in an ordinary three-spatial-dimensional world. How do you make the extra-dimensional world look richer without the lower-dimensional one being too uninteresting to watch?
THC: When were you inspired to shift your collaboration to the visual arts?
LR: I met a number of people in the art world when I was visiting Los Angeles who were personally involved in creating art and curating it. Peter Mays [Executive Director of the Los Angeles Art Association] asked me if I wanted to work on an exhibition. He told me that one of the things that he found interesting was the fact that I was not all about representing science explicitly—that I really had more of an [artistic] outlook and thought the art was ultimately primary.
THC: Your upcoming exhibition “Measure for Measure” explores the connection between scale, art, and science. Can you explain how the exhibition achieves this aim?
LR: I thought it would be really interesting to take a theme that resonates with both scientists and artists. The very talented painter and photographer Lia Halloran, who co-curated the exhibit, and I selected artists that we thought could do something along those lines. For an artist, [a work] is all about scale and how things get projected. We were inspired by the scientific idea that you can have different messages [and] different physical properties on different scales. So we tried to encourage that in these various pieces. None of them were specifically about science, but they all reflected science and were also inspired by this idea of different scales. All of [the artists] really thought about how they would work with each other and work with the theme to really bring the exhibition together.
THC: What do you hope that viewers who do not have extensive backgrounds in the sciences take away from seeing “Measure for Measure”?
LR: First of all, I hope to convey that there is an intersection between science and art. Art is a reflection on culture, but [the exhibit] also hopefully inspires people to think about specific scientific ideas as well. I think it might make them look at the world a little bit differently, and realize that how you see the world depends on the scale with which you view it. All the pieces bear close inspection. Although not all the pieces were specifically reflecting on science, Felicity Nove’s piece and Meeson Yang’s pieces, for example, involve viewers in reflections on space or a specific biological element. Our formulation of our ideas about the world depends on how we view it.

Edward Cullen of “Twilight,” Bill Compton of “True Blood,” and other romanticized fictional vampires have overwhelmed recent popular culture, but not without reviving the story of the original blood-sucking seducer, Count Dracula. Dracula is the archetype of the undead neck-piercing monster. The eponymous novel, written by Bram Stoker in 1897, does not feature the first vampire to appear in literature, but it created the vampire we know today—sexy, sleek, and humanized. Stoker’s creation is faithfully reproduced in the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production of “Dracula,” directed by Valeriya Tsitron ’14 and running until November 5 in the Loeb Experimental Theater. The loyal interpretation lends itself to the show’s commendable acting—its greatest strength—but both are somewhat undermined by discordant transitions and a confusing narrative structure.
Steven Dietz’s script follows the original story with only a few altered details. The play traces the events following Count Dracula’s decision to relocate from Transylvania to England for the “banquet” of fresh blood offered by the “teeming millions” in London. The events are narrated by Renfield (Joey J. Kim ’15), a mental patient who claims to have a special connection to Dracula and is under the care of Dr. Seward (William R. Montgomery ’15). Upon his arrival in London, Dracula begins to prey on Lucy Westenra (Mikhaila R. Fogel ’15) and Mina Murray (Lelaina E. Vogel ’15), leading Seward and Jonathan Harker (John F. Morton ’15)—their respective lovers—to attempt to hunt down the blood-sucker with help from famed vampire hunter Abraham Van Helsing (Tony J. Sterle ’11).
The characters are uniformly well cast.. Mina—a standout performance by Vogel—is an integral character in the story, a strong-willed and intelligent woman in the late nineteenth century. She is a stable contrast to Lucy’s capricious and faint-hearted nature. Montgomery’s Dr. Seward is also noteworthy, especially in his tense exchanges with Sterle’s Van Helsing. Their fast-paced and emotional exchanges are flawless and engaging. The most enthralling performance, however, is Kim’s as Renfield, the mental patient. His chilling manner of speech and frightening stare are a delight to watch. They act as the locus of the play’s fear and anxiety. The entire cast is impressive, especially in their command of the formal English of Stoker’s time. However, there are some moments when modern accented English slips into the play. Words like “wanna” and “gonna” significantly lessen the authenticity of the performance.
At times, the fact that the play is essentially an exact replica of the book on stage may ostracize those who have not read it. A few portions of the performance lack physical elaboration, including a scene in which the characters simply describe their chase of Dracula while standing on stage. In addition, some of the transitions seem to create significant chasms between the scenes and interrupt the fluidity of the show, negatively affecting the fantasy’s generally engrossing qualities. For instance, in the middle of the play, the happenings in Transylvania between Harker and Dracula are briefly recounted in a flashback, confusing the sequence of events.
Although the play is a traditional reenactment of a classic horror tale, there are moments of modernization. Some improve the production, but just as many detract. The background music for the show includes instrumental pieces from modern artists such as Explosions in the Sky. During the show, these songs are played too loud, focusing the audience’s attention on what they are hearing, and not what they are watching. In contrast, a sensual dance between Mina and Dracula to Florence and the Machine’s “Heavy in Your Arms” is an unexpected but alluring complement to Dracula’s seduction.
“Dracula” is an entertaining show that—despite some structural flaws—ultimately leaves the audience with a shiver up their spine and a chill in the room. The final impression reflects Renfield’s parting warning: “A fear once rooted in your mind is yours forever.”

The efficacy of particular artistic expressions has a lot to do with timing. From conception to production to reception, no part of the artistic process takes place in a temporal vacuum—and the effects of timing can be hard to predict. For instance, some art manages to seem so frustratingly irrelevant that it wiggles its way back into relevance.
In the age of the infinite scroll of Tumblr, Selichi Furuya installs a wheezing slide projector in a corner of Galerie Thomas Fischer in Berlin. The photographs in the exhibition entitled “Mémoires” are relics from 1978 to 1985 and the DDR (East Germany). They depict Furuya’s long-deceased wife, landscapes long altered, and events that took place under a government long dissolved. The works operate in their stagnant remoteness, revealing the inescapable gaps between what we expect pictures to say and what they actually say, the details we so regularly glaze over because of our relentless routinized encounter with the camera and photography.
Pictures of friends in parties, dorm rooms, and foreign lands circulate steadily. Iconic images of moments and people pop up in textbooks and lectures. PR-approved and news agency-snapped pictures appear alongside articles and on television. Each celebrity’s every outfit is charted on blogs and magazines. Photography has its own institutional position in art. For the most part, we view and understand photographs through these familiar, established contexts. Thus, we expect or look for little more. We don’t analyze the formal elements of a picture of posed friends, just as we don’t nitpick about what makes the outfits of political ambassadors (not) work.
Photography in art is hardly above such structured viewing. We expect certain models: Walker Evans’ aestheticism, Cindy Sherman’s wittiness, the Bechers’ documentation, for example. But the photograph as article and thing—as something with limitations—is lost. By relying on context to understand photographs, we project meanings upon them—meanings they do not necessarily convey on their own. But can we hope to separate the photographs themselves from the meanings we reflexively project onto them?
“Mémoires” has been shown since 1979, but it resonates especially well now. Furuya is caught in the futile plight of documenting, collecting, and archiving in order to preserve and remember. But the camera and the photograph are never enough, because while they fixate moments in their eerie exact stillness, they also lament them as passed away, leaving only a visual trace. We have the aids of remembrance in the photographs, but we were never present for the specific moments that they captured and therefore cannot remember. Estranged and incapable of understanding “Mémoires” under the context provided, we are finally unable to ascertain the purpose and function of the photographs within seconds, finally lost.
Furuya’s photographs are jagged fragments that do not come together to form some “whole picture” that can be easily understood or categorized. Most are unremarkable—a wife and child in a museum, an eggplant and radishes sitting next to the sink, a blurry shot from the rain streaked window, an apartment block. The slide projector switches out the images steadily—five seconds, the click of the plastic, and the blank wall before the appearance of the next image. Sitting in the lone stool in the already isolated space, you stare at the projected image, conscious that each image and your appreciation of it is set to a timer that you have no control over. We struggle to grasp the images as they appear one after the other, struggle to examine them on their own and situate them in relation to each other. We shuffle halfheartedly from the individual picture to the whole group of pictures, incapable of saying much about either.
The ordeal is disorienting and unsatisfying, as we can lay no claim either to what the photographs depict or to how we approach the photographs. We cannot stomach this experience. Unable to understand Furuya’s project in his terms of loss and remembrance, we are also unable to apply the conventions and structures in which we regularly grasp photographs. Not this category and not that context … The dated slide projector, photographs, and subject matter encourage us, finally, not to understand.

Who is Roberto Bolaño? So much has been written and said about his short life that is impossible to distinguish the man from the legend. Literary critics across the world have fallen all over themselves in praising his vivid prose and imaginative characters. Once a vagabond dropout who drifted unknown and jobless between Chile, Mexico, El Salvador, France, and Spain, Bolaño has catapulted into the canon of legendary stars who died too young. He’s now the heir to Jorge Luis Borges and Gabriel García Márquez, the “Kurt Cobain of Latin American literature,” according to literary critic Daniel Crimmins. Bolaño is no longer a just a man; he represents a literary movement, a generation, a counterculture.
Yet his latest poetry collection, “Tres,” makes it clear that Bolaño had as much trouble discerning his true identity as the literary world does now. “Tres,” which includes three long poems written in the 1980s and the 1990s before Bolaño’s literary rise, addresses identity, purpose, and belonging—and the lack thereof. Translated by Laura Healy, this new collection captures the dreamy quality of Bolaño’s writing style while offering insight into the fraught mental states of a brilliant writer on the cusp of a breakthrough.
The first poem, “Prose from Autumn in Gerona,” is a dizzying experiment with form. Each page contains one cryptic paragraph, usually disjointed from the previous and following pages. “Autumn in Gerona” was written in Gerona, Spain in 1981. It follows a writer named R. Bolaño in Gerona in 1981, but it traffics in different layers of reality and blurs the line between memoir and fiction. Some pages Bolaño writes in first person; sometimes he is a third-person protagonist; sometimes he addresses the reader as the protagonist; and sometimes he writes the poem like a screenplay. The result can only be described using the word that dominates “Autumn:” kaleidoscopic. As in a kaleidoscope, each page serves as an illuminating reflection of a writer who struggles with unrequited love, creative stagnancy, and spiritual stasis.
In addition to showcasing doubts about his personal life, Bolaño voices insecurities about his own writing and his disillusionment with writing as a whole. “Cut it out with the bullshit text!” screams the protagonist’s love interest. After trudging through opaque phrases such as “the kaleidoscope assumes the look of solitude,” Bolaño abruptly returns to loud, simple prose in which he questions his own literary capabilities: “Get me out of this text, I’ll want to say, show me things clear and simple.” But he discovers, through his interactions with his disengaged lover, that reality can be just as messy and contrived as poetry. Bolaño and his lover constantly fail to understand each other, and eventually she abandons him, explaining away the break-up with clichés like “moving on, acquiring nourishment and looking for more.” Maybe the kaleidoscope of literature. with all of its different angles and lenses, is the clearest and most complete way to see the world.
“The Neochileans,” written 12 years after “Autumn in Gerona” and around the time of the publication of Bolaño’s first novel, maintains the confusion and doubt of Bolaño’s earlier work. The poem is a coming-of-age story of sorts about an idealistic group of young musicians searching for a movement to latch on to. Pancho Ferri and his Neochileans are a reincarnation of Kerouac’s Dean Moriarty and the Beats: bored and cynical, they hit the road in pursuit of a promised land—the American West for the beats, North towards Ecuador for the Neochileans. The poem is filled with paradoxically rich imagery that nevertheless captures the barrenness of the band’s surroundings: “Assassins and converts / chit-chatting / with the deaf and mute, / With imbeciles turned loose / From Purgatory.” The Neochileans try to construct their identities as they go along—Pancho changes his name midway through—and in the end find that they aren’t really searching for anything substantial, as the narrator “realized / The Neochileans / Would be forever / Governed / by chance.” The poem as a whole paints South America as a desolate, corrupt, lonely place with little hope for the future.
The apocalyptic imagery of “The Neochileans” leads straight into the bleak fantasy world of “A Stroll Through Literature.” Also written in 1993, the last poem is a glimpse into Bolaño’s dreams. In each numbered dream, Bolaño meets a fabled writer who either needs help or is doing something incomprehensible to the speaker. “I dreamt Mark Twain was hiring me to save the life of someone without a face,” he recounts helplessly. Written before he became a legend himself, these accounts illustrate Bolaño’s respect for the writers before him and show the anxiety he feels in living up to them. Usually, he is too late or unable to help his heroes resolve their bizarre problems. He appears most often in his dreams as an “old detective,” overwhelmed and out of touch with the worlds he enters and the cases that he is supposed to crack. Many times he ends up back on the streets of Mexico City, vulnerable and homeless, as Bolaño did in real life.
In the last paragraph, Bolaño futilely attempts to console a three-year-old Georges Perec. “I said to myself: I’m good for nothing … Then it started to rain and we calmly went back home. But where was our home?” This last paragraph encapsulates the overwhelming emotions that envelope “Tres.” These autobiographical poems reveal Bolaño as lost, desperate, and without identity—and it was this emotional turmoil that inspired his beautiful and raw poetry. There’s no doubt that the literary world will be piecing together Bolaño’s life story for years to come. “Tres” offers three different lenses into the kaleidoscope that was his confusing, teeming mind.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“You don’t have to be so anxious about it,” my mother told me last spring during Junior Parents Weekend, after I had confessed to her in that I was beginning to believe that I would never love again, and that no one would ever love me, and also that I would never get married. “Maybe you will get married; maybe you won’t get married. It’s up to you,” my mother said. And then, in the way of mothers, she reminded me that I was a junior in college and that, comparatively speaking, I was very young. Yet it is sometimes difficult not to be anxious about marriage when people seem to be talking so much about it. With the acceptance of gay marriage slowly but surely making its way across the nation and with articles like Kate Bolick’s “All the Single Ladies”—which explores reasons for smart women to stay single—cropping up everywhere, young people today cannot seem to escape the cultural conversation about marriage qua institution.
Marriage as specter in the life of young people is the subject of Jeffrey Eugenides’s new novel “The Marriage Plot.” Never showcasing a truly happy marriage, Eugenides’s novel specifically warns against the perils of marrying too young. The work, which is set in the early 1980s, follows three characters in their last semester as undergraduates at Brown University and into the following year. But while “The Marriage Plot” shows careful consideration for young love, its characters never escape their status as literary clichés. The novel lacks the formal sophistication of Eugenides’s debut, “The Virgin Suicides,” which was narrated in the first person plural, nor is the subject matter as thought-provoking as his second novel “Middlesex,” which explored the life of a hermaphrodite. Instead he focuses on the difficulties of being a young intellectual in love.
Despite Reflexive Humor, Eugenides’s Tired ‘Plot’ Disappoints
The heroine Madeleine Hanna, painfully bien élevé in the New England fashion, is writing her undergraduate thesis on the marriage plot in 19th-century American and British literature. In her final semester, she takes an upper-level seminar in semiotics and it is there that she meets Leonard Bankhead, a troubled young man from Portland with whom she falls in love. They embark on a tumultuous relationship and ultimately move to Cape Cod together after they graduate. Much of their story revolves around Leonard’s manic depression and Madeleine’s desire to “save” and to care for him, a choice that from the beginning seems destined to fail. All the while, Mitchell Grammaticus, one of Madeleine’s first friends at Brown, lingers in the background, in love with her and long suffering. Mitchell is “the kind of smart, sane, parent-pleasing boy she should fall in love with and marry.” Of course, Madeleine has very little interest in him. Spurned by Madeleine and desperate for authentic experience, Mitchell decides to travel in Europe and India with a friend. During his journey, Mitchell, a religion major in college, becomes increasingly fascinated by the religious practices he encounters. Eugenides interweaves Mitchell’s experience abroad with Madeleine’s and Leonard’s in Cape Cod, but also relies heavily on flashbacks to the trio’s childhoods and college days.
“The Marriage Plot” does convey fairly accurately what it is to be a young woman of around college age struggling to understand how to navigate romantic relationships. For example, a few weeks after Leonard and Madeleine have broken up for the first time, Madeleine’s roommates insist that she attend a party with them. At the party, she runs into another student from her semiotics class and ultimately goes home with him. Eugenides writes: “It wasn’t clear to Madeleine what she was seeking when she pulled Thurston’s underpants down. She stood apart from the person doing this.” She then proceeds to perform oral sex on him, with the continued feeling that she is not present during the act. While the notion that a wounded college girl might try to quash her emotions with liquor and casual sex is not particularly original, there is poignancy and sensitivity in Eugenides’ description. “Her mouth just wasn’t the organ nature had designed for this function. She felt orally overextended, like a dental patient waiting for a cast to dry.” Through this heartbreaking combination of alienation and humorous reflexivity, Eugenides sketches a painfully true portrait of a young woman working through the problem of what it means to be a sexual creature.
There is a similarly touching melancholy in the way Madeleine tries to understand her relationship with Leonard through her newfound knowledge of semiotics: “it was during this period that Madeleine fully understood how the lover’s discourse was of an extreme solitude. The solitude was extreme because it wasn’t physical. It was extreme because you felt in the company of the person you loved. It was extreme because it was in your head, the most solitary of places.”
However, while this is a particularly elegant portrayal of Madeleine’s desire to be loved and its interaction with her academic interests, Eugenides does not seem to think deeply about his own signifiers, and at times his reliance on stereotypes detracts from the novel’s originality. He writes: “The university’s ‘British and American Literature Course Catalog’ was, for Madeleine, what its Bergdorf equivalent was for her roommates.” Despite a degree of superficial irony here, the characters of “The Marriage Plot” never transcend their origins as well-established literary types. Madeleine is a sexy, bookish WASP; Leonard a brooding, disturbed young man; Mitchell a wandering spirit. The portrayal of Mitchell is the most annoying: he journeys to India to find himself, but has to come back to Madeleine in order to really change. The novel is self-conscious about this problem, and Eugenides seems to suggest that these characters are supposed to be types. Yet that does not make his clichés of class any more interesting. In this vein, the fact that Eugenides is a middle-aged man writing about what it means to be a college woman is somewhat problematic. His heavy reliance on stereotypes to develop Madeleine’s thoughts and personality seems to suggest an implicit sexism.
Despite these issues, ”The Marriage Plot” is rescued by its humorous sensitivity. It is full of moments that any current or former humanities major will enjoy. “Who’s your father?” one of Madeleine’s love interests asks her. “Is it Virginia Woolf? Is it Sontag?” When Madeleine responds that her real father is her father, her boyfriend responds: “Then you have to kill him.” When she in turn asks him who his father is, he says: “Godard.” One can’t help but wonder, though, if writing this essentially classical novel about the problem of being young and in love was Eugenides’s way of killing his own literary fathers.

In his latest novel, Alan Hollinghurst has cemented his status as one of the most notable modern chroniclers of gay life. “The Stranger’s Child” returns to his trademark stately descriptions and nuanced portrayals of human sexuality, all while avoiding the pitfalls of setting a novel in a time period as potentially stale as World War I. In the novel Hollinghurst describes the eccentricities of one man, a fictional poet named Cecil Valence, over the span of four generations and two World Wars. Yet the characters remain in the same houses and towns, and continue to make the same mistakes. This structure may seem overused or repetitive, and Hollinghurst’s characters do indeed lust for one another, drink too much, and reveal too many secrets in what eventually develops into a tiring cycle of regret. Though this tragic plot appears countless times, “The Stranger’s Child” feels fresh despite its many allusions to dead poets and oft-experienced human fumbles.
The title character is only alive in the first fifth of the novel, and it is his untimely death sets off the subplots of every other character. Cecil has two lovers who are brother and sister. By denying each his devotion, he drives both siblings to an existence of turmoil and dissatisfaction. Through these two relationships, Cecil manages to touch the lives of many characters, some of whom are so inspired by his lingering presence as to write his biographies, while others merely swoon for his memory. It seems incredible that the life of one man, who only lived to 25, should affect so many people. In his novel Hollinghurst writes of Cecil as “undeniably a very minor poet who just happened to have written lines here and there that had stuck … But his life was dramatic as well as short, and now everyone was mad about the First World War.”
England continues to mourn for its men who, like Cecil, lost their lives in World War I, and throughout the novel the characters are preoccupied, even obsessed, with the past. Each seems to be perpetually sifting through relics from the previous generation, an eerie motif that trails each new character through the five sections of the novel. The first is set in 1913 when Cecil Valence wrote his famous “Two Acres” poem, and later sections jump chronologically by a decade or more until the final section, set in the present day. The effect of this constant chronological jumping is a bit disarming—the reader is forced to regain footing and learn new characters every 50 pages, but it also allows a glimpse into a rare variety of perspectives, which range from the youthful to the senile.
Hollinghurst is experienced with the historical novel, and he weaves an expertly coherent account of the early 20th century in a style reminiscent of E.M. Forster or D.H. Lawrence. Though his understatement and his focus on intimate relationships is consistent with the works of these masters, Hollinghurst’s diction is altogether new. Highly specific and occasionally vulgar, the language is nonetheless refreshing—a necessary quality, since the themes throughout the novel are purposely repetitive. When describing a woman playing piano, he writes, “Her little hands looked brave and comical as they stretched and rumbled and tinkled. She rocked and jumped from one buttock to the other, in her stiff red dress, her black wrap slipping—it twitched and drooped behind her as she moved, with a worrying life of its own.” Certainly no writer has yet written such a description, and Hollinghurst does not stop there. Rather, his unique language choices permeate the text and invite a new perspective on each scene.
The relationships in “The Stranger’s Child” are as unconventional as Hollinghurst’s style. Each love scene is between two men, or between a woman and a man who is attracted to men. His frank portrayal of homosexuality is jarring given the conservative cultural milieu, and it is this along with Hollinghurst’s nuanced diction that alerts us that this is a contemporary spin on the past. For though there are frequent allusions to greater, dead poets—the title itself is an allusion to Lord Tennyson’s most famous poem—this novel never betrays any stench of age.
However, some critics dismiss Hollinghurst’s tendency to write solely about gay characters as a cop-out, meant to substitute for originality and sophistication. John Updike controversially wrote that Hollinghurst’s novels “take some getting used to; they are relentlessly gay in their personnel.” But no part of “The Stranger’s Child” seems indulgent, only delightfully different in its wordings—and this includes its depictions of sexual relationships. No other author would describe nature “restoring itself in a secret flow of scent,” and women walking in “heady swoop[s] across the lawn;” Hollinghurst’s unique permutations of language never fail to surprise and delight.
“The Stranger’s Child” immerses readers in another world so entrenched in its own rules and obsessions that the final image of Cecil Valence’s poem and his presence is unforgettable. The novel travels through a century of literary residue, and for readers as for Hollinghurst’s characters, Cecil lingers in the mind even after his story has concluded.

There are only so many puns that one can make in a world where an individual’s “time”—that is, minutes of lifespan—serves as both “life” and “money,” but “In Time” somehow manages to nail them all. Cops are “timekeepers,” robbers are “minutemen,” and neighborhoods are “time-zones.” Keeping time, saving time, spending time, take your time, lifetime, killing time—it’s 110 minutes of punning and not much else.
The film boasts numerous big names, including Justin Timberlake, Amanda Seyfried, Olivia Wilde, writer-director Andrew Niccol of “The Truman Show” fame, and legendary cinematographer Roger Deakins (“True Grit”). You know a project with such talent is in trouble when its most memorable element is the punning. Sadly, though, “In Time” seems to be an all too common case of fine ingredients mixed in the wrong combination.
The premise of the script is a promising one, as evidenced by the buzz generated by the film’s trailer. Timberlake’s Will Salas lives in a world where people stop aging at 25 and are given only one year left to live, unless they can replenish their “clock,” a set of glowing green digits on their forearms. Time, literally, is money, and if your clock runs down to zero, you “time out”—another one!—and die.
Time can be shared—or stolen—by grabbing another person’s wrist and transferring it. When Will meets an unusually fortunate but troubled man with a century on his watch, he finds himself in a predicament after the man transfers all his time to Will and times out. Will is consequently accused of murder, and this injustice, along with the death of his mother (Olivia Wilde), convinces him that his society’s structure is flawed beyond repair. He embarks on a journey to break down the system, and kidnaps the lovely and wealthy Sylvia (Amanda Seyfried) in the process, who somewhat predictably turns from Will’s prisoner to his partner—in crime and otherwise.
But this slick setup—having a constant ticking clock on your protagonist’s forearm certainly keeps the stakes high—ultimately results in a project that leaves something to be desired in terms of its characters. For a film that demonstrates tremendous creativity in constructing its universe, “In Time” seems to have exhausted its supply when it comes to crafting its inhabitants.
Timberlake does best in roles where he plays himself—a wise-cracking cool kid who keeps audiences laughing—as he recently demonstrated in “The Social Network.” This action drama just wasn’t for him. But to be fair, while the part might have been better executed by a DiCaprio-type, even alternative casting wouldn’t have solved the inherent problems of the Salas character. Will’s plot arc is simply too clichéd and unidimensional: he’s a loyal son and citizen turned ruthless Robin Hood who steals from the rich, gives to the poor, and generally rails against all things societal. Few viewers will be surprised or engaged by this predictable progression.
Seyfriend and her character suffer from similar problems. Sylvia spends most of her screen time looking doe-eyed and mysterious—that is, when she’s not indulging her rather uninspired lust. Beyond that, she’s a rebellious heiress, as one-note as an Ariel or a Jasmine lifted straight from a children’s narrative.
Overall, the story of “In Time” is either too absurdist or too overtly political to enjoy, and its characters are too flat to inspire empathy. Despite the valiant efforts of its talented cast and crew to prop it up, this bold attempt at execution of a promising premise soon comes toppling down. Unfortunately, when all is said and done, the punning presaged by its title is the most that the disappointing “In Time” has to offer.

For someone who has presumably spent her life in the shadow of superstar sisters, Elizabeth Olsen—the younger sibling of twins Mary-Kate and Ashley—seems right at home in the spotlight. Playing a paranoid and skittish escapee of an abusive cult, Olsen exquisitely embodies the many names she carries in Sean Durkin’s first feature length film “Martha Marcy May Marlene.” As writer-director Durkin slowly reveals small pieces of the muddled puzzle that is the main character’s past, it is Olsen who expresses how damaged she truly is by those experiences. With her hollow, unsettling eyes and utter lack of social graces, Olsen makes the effects of brainwashing believable and genuinely frightening, and consistently keeps the audience as disturbed as her character.
The film opens with Olsen creeping through a large farmhouse. She passes rooms filled with sleeping bodies and stuffs a small backpack along her way. When she reaches the door, she takes off, fleeing into the woods across the street as someone calls out “Marcy! Marcy May!” She calls her sister Lucy (Sarah Paulson), who comes to collect her. Lucy calls her “Martha” and tells her she shouldn’t have disappeared for two years. Lucy brings Martha back to the summer home she shares with her new husband Ted (Hugh Dancy), where it becomes increasingly apparent that Martha has forgotten how to function in normal society.
As Martha continues her odd practices of wearing dirty, bland clothing, refusing to eat, and asking impertinent questions about her sister’s comfortable lifestyle, her present begins to trigger memories of her past, and chunks of her life in the cult she left are revealed. It turns out that she and her boyfriend Watts (Brady Corbet) first came to the cult in what was intended to be a temporary stay to try their hand at farm life. In flashback, they are introduced to the cult’s patriarchal leader Patrick (John Hawkes), who insists that they will “find their place” and that they simply “have to trust us.” With a slight frame and timid smile, Patrick seems benign enough. He takes an interest in the then-charming and polite Martha, renaming her “Marcy May.”
Though it is clear that Martha is wary of the cult, her vulnerability wins out and gradually she joins in, and the audience sympathizes with her need for stability. We see how Patrick subtly takes advantage of Martha’s insecurities, telling her that while her mom is dead, her father has abandoned her and her sister has gone off to college, her new “family” is here for her.
It is Olsen who carries this movie, seamlessly integrating the various facets of her character’s diffracted personality into a tense whole. While Durkin’s script juxtaposes the former Martha entering the cult with the current Marcy May on the run, it is Olsen who actually exhibits how drastic this transformation truly is. Martha’s polite nature dissipates as she is told to open herself up and join the family to become Marcy May. And when the cult takes a disturbingly violent turn, her snap back to reality is just as tangible. Olsen’s powerful and poignant performance conveys the deep-seated fear that the cult will recapture her, and ensures that Martha is sympathetic even in her most alienating moments.
Adding to the tense nature of Martha’s past is the misleading and charismatic Hawkes. Acclaimed for his turn as meth dealer Teardrop in the Oscar-nominated “Winter’s Bone,” Hawkes’s Patrick draws upon his rural upbringing to mask his manipulations with homespun wisdom. His repetition of phrases such as “trust us” and “share yourself” are almost hypnotic, easily absorbed into the subconscious.
Durkin employs a few choice techniques that add to the film’s pervasive tension. At moments of high stress, the film’s soundtrack features a low rumbling noise that can only be likened to blood rushing to the ears. The sound is viscerally effective, not immediately obvious in its implications yet slowly triggering a discomforting anxiety. There are also small tricks of the camera designed to draw out the film’s suspense, as in one scene where the frame seems to inch toward the shadow of a man before pivoting to reveal a woman rounding the corner.
But perhaps most affecting is Durkin’s emphasis on life cycles, both harmless and destructive, and the dangers of their banality. In this way, Durkin lends a sinister undercurrent to otherwise unassuming occurrences. Many of Martha’s daily meals are depicted—both the quiet, ritualistic ones with the cult and the often explosive ones shared with Lucy and Ted that grow increasingly uncomfortable as Martha’s strange behavior fails to improve. But most off-putting is the cycle of members joining the cult. Just as Martha was brainwashed, so she brainwashes young, impressionable newcomers and rationalizes away their fears with the same ease as Patrick, and repeating the same phrases.
Durkin’s and Olsen’s debut is a haunting glimpse into the rhythmic and mesmerizing functioning of a cult and what happens when that rhythm is abruptly broken for one member. Though the film’s ending may leave many unsatisfied and relieve little of the story’s tension, this seems to be Durkin’s intention: to ask if a cult ever truly leaves you once you’ve entered it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the preface to her 1968 essay collection “Slouching Towards Bethlehem,” Joan Didion included a line that, in just six words, encapsulates the strange business of writing nonfiction: “Writers,” she explained, “are always selling somebody out.”
In the years since, those six little words have transformed the act of writing into a delicate ethical transaction between writer and subject, predator and prey. The catch, of course, is that writers are “selling somebody out” even when they admire their subject and intend to celebrate them on the page. The crime, as it were, is that the writer forces the subject—an ordinary person, someone unaccustomed to being written about or interviewed—to see himself in a light far different than the one in which he sees himself. As Janet Malcolm would later write in “The Journalist and the Murderer,” her 1990 reflection on Didion’s six words, writers prey “on people’s vanity, ignorance or loneliness, gaining their trust and betraying them without remorse.”
In that sense, one might say that Joan Didion has made a living selling people out. Her essays, after all, are often ruthless in their honesty: take, for instance, her 1976 profile of James Pike, the progressive Anglican bishop who was an early advocate of racial desegregation and LGBT equality. Didion concluded that Pike represented nothing but the most superficial dimension of American spiritual life. His “sense that the world can be reinvented smells of the Sixties in this country, those years when no one at all seemed to have any memory or mooring,” she wrote, “and in a way the Sixties were the years for which James Albert Pike was born.”
In recent years, however, Didion—whose clean, supple prose and sharp insights into the paradoxes of countercultural America have earned her a much-deserved seat among the greatest essayists this country has produced—has shifted her focus.
Although famous for inserting personal reflection into her journalistic essays, her last three books have been, more or less, memoirs—or, rather, the type of memoirs that only Joan Didion could write, which move between memory, analysis, commentary, and sometimes cultural history. “Where I Was From,” released in 2003, is a meditation on her native California that presents the history of her family through the history of the state. 2005’s “The Year of Magical Thinking,” which won the National Book Award and made her a celebrity, chronicles the year in which she lost her husband and lifelong companion, the writer John Gregory Dunne. And “Blue Nights,” out today, comes to terms with the death of her beloved daughter, Quintana Roo Dunne, at the age of 39.
Each of these contains a far more personal dimension than usually appears in her essays and her novels. And yet “Blue Nights,” in which Didion addresses her life as a mother, the heartbreak of her daughter’s death, and, finally, her own mortality, has a sense of finality the others do not. In a sense, it is her most forthcoming and most intimate book yet. The question, then, is what to make of a book in which a writer with so much experience “selling somebody out” essentially does the same to herself. To her credit, Didion is as honest with her readers about Joan Didion as she has been about all her previous subjects.
The book draws its title from the “blue nights” of early summer at northern latitudes, where, as Didion writes, “the end of summer is fast and lost in the blaze of the dropping sun.” These nights, she maintains, signal a change of season, the coming of summer, and, simultaneously, a slight suggestion of the darkness to follow. “Blue nights,” she writes, “are the opposite of the dying of the brightness, but they are also its warning.” Regarding her time with Quintana, Didion admits that she believed these blue nights would never end and that the darkness would never come.
It did, of course, come. Over Christmas 2003, Quintana contracted the flu. She developed pneumonia and septic shock and then, on December 30, her father died of a heart attack while Didion made a salad: “You sit down to dinner and life as you know it ends,” she wrote in “The Year of Magical Thinking.” After a brief recovery, Quintana suffered a cerebral hemorrhage in the spring of 2004. After a year of hospitalization, she died the following summer.
The honesty of “Blue Nights,” of course, comes from the way Didion relates her own experience as an adoring mother. As attentive as she was to her only child, adopted in 1966, Didion confesses her failure to recognize Quintana’s anxiety and fear of abandonment. “I had seen her wishing for death as she lay on the floor of her sitting room in Brentwood Park,” Didion writes. “Let me just be in the ground, she had kept sobbing. Let me just be in the ground and go to sleep.” As a memoirist, Didion resists the temptation to make excuses for her shortcomings as a mother, to obfuscate the truth, or to have the last word. In every situation she describes, the fault, if anyone’s, is her own. “She was already a person,” she writes of Quintana. “I could never afford to see that.” At no point in “Blue Nights” does the blame fall on anyone other than herself.
Didion is even honest about what is probably the most common criticism of her later work, what the critic John Lahr once dubbed the “Brentwood Blues”––her anxiety and uncertainty over own her own values and her position in a world of privilege. After all, she mentions such details as Quintana wearing Louboutin heels to her wedding, that the cake she served came from Payard, and that the first time she tried caviar occurred at Chicago’s storied Ambassador Hotel. Didion makes no apology for the charmed life she and shared with her husband and Quintana, but she nevertheless addresses the point: “I wanted to lay this on the table,” she says, and, with similar candor, there is no other subject she refuses to discuss.
That no subject, in a sense, is banned from Didion’s table is ultimately what gives “Blue Nights” its power. While she confesses that after Quintana’s death she “was no longer, if I had ever been, afraid to die,” what is even more remarkable is that she is not afraid to tell.

Perhaps a better title for Roland Emmerich’s “Anonymous” would be “Death in Slow Motion.” Emmerich, the director of “Godzilla,” “The Day After Tomorrow,” and “2012,” merrily revels in his screenplay’s many gruesome deaths. He seems desperate to show that he can still kill off hordes of people in stylized fashion in a film supposedly about the debated authorship of Shakespeare’s plays. In fact, Shakespeare’s works themselves play a rather limited role in Emmerich’s account of their genesis. More prevalent are plotlines concerning hunchbacks, illegitimate children, incest, various rebellions, and a vigorous medieval form of indoor tennis. Does all this sound bewildering? It is.
The film opens, strangely enough, in a modern setting, with an unidentified man standing on a stage explaining to the audience that Shakespeare, the so-called “soul of the ages,” may have been a complete fraud. Stagehands proceed to turn on a rain machine and the audience is then somehow whisked away—perhaps by the rain’s magical time travel properties—to 17th-century England. Of course, this is an England where it is almost never daytime, where unwanted peasant babies find their way into noble families with regularity, and where Vanessa Redgrave, as Queen Elizabeth I, displays more cleavage than previously thought possible of a woman of her age and reputation.
“Anonymous” operates on the premise that Edward de Vere (Rhys Ifans), the Earl of Oxford, penned the works now attributed to Shakespeare. For fear of being punished for crafting seditious materials, he asks Ben Jonson (Sebastian Armesto), an amateur playwright, to ensure that his plays are performed under another name. William Shakespeare (Rafe Spall), portrayed as an illiterate, arrogant sod, quickly takes on the job. Meanwhile, de Vere’s friends plot a rebellion against the Queen and flashbacks detail de Vere’s questionable parentage and past dalliances, which are somehow meant to explain his present affinity for poetry.
This unsatisfying summary is evidence of the film’s overall lack of focus. There are simply too many plotlines to follow, and none of them is sufficiently unpacked, developed, or brought to resolution. In fact, the only true progress the film makes through time is through its many inane flashbacks, which seem solely to provide excuses for steamy love scenes and noisy stabbings.
It’s almost as though Emmerich, perhaps uncomfortable with the notion of a film leaving him few opportunities for impressive explosions or sweeping battle scenes, sought to throw in the occasional massacre for his own amusement. The general ethos Emmerich imparts to the film is aptly expressed by a guard who, while searching enthusiastically for Jonson in the film’s opening, repeatedly screeches “Burn it down!” as other guards happily introduce their torches to flammable sectors of the Globe Theatre.
This melodramatic and muddled film’s only saving grace lies in some of its performances: Ifans adeptly inhabits the role of the conflicted Earl of Oxford, and communicates equal measures of disdain, inner conflict, and pain with a single look. Spall, as the hedonistic, greedy, and fraudulent Shakespeare, creates perhaps the only relatable individual in a film that generally fails to develop the motives and personalities of most of its characters. Redgrave, however, usually an impressive presence on screen, is trapped by an awkward script and its completely one-dimensional characterization of Queen Elizabeth I. One scene even has the aged monarch dancing and giggling in front of a mirror, a silly interlude that undermines any gravitas the actress might have hoped to bring to the role.
Emmerich does craft a grimy, bleak world that ensnares the viewer. A pub frequented by starving writers seems so realistic that one can almost smell the mixture of unwashed artists, ale, and general filth. But that authenticity would have been more compelling in a focused, polished film. Instead, “Anonymous” is an exercise in confusion—a film that touts itself as one about rightful Shakespearian authorship but instead morphs into a mess of nebulous political side stories. “Words will prevail,” de Vere claims at one point. Perhaps Emmerich should have heeded that advice, and focused on making a film more attentive to dialogue and characterization than overblown violence and histrionics.

William S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan’s spirited 1878 comic opera “H.M.S. Pinafore; or, the Lass That Loved a Sailor” is a much-loved staple of musical theatre. Starting November 3, the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert & Sullivan Players (HRG&SP) will be staging the piece for the first time since its 50th anniversary production in 2006. “H.M.S. Pinafore” follows the romantic misadventures of a captain’s daughter, Josephine (Allison A. Ray ’14), who is supposed to marry the proud Sir Joseph Porter (Christian N. Fohrby ’14) despite her hidden love for a lowly sailor.
Filled with energetic music and dancing set aboard a ship at sea, the opera’s status as Gilbert and Sullivan’s first major international success and one of their most enduring creations is understandable. Yet the HRG&SP intend to put a new twist on this well-known tale. Director Ashley N. Kaupert ’12 has transplanted the action from a royal navy ship to a swanky 1930s cruise liner, complete with period costumes and shuffleboard. “We changed [the setting] because [this play] is one of the big three shows [written by Gilbert and Sullivan] and we wanted to do something that would get the audience’s attention,” she says.
Kaupert adds that updating the production has been a challenge. “It’s so much easier to just do a period piece,” she says, “because there’s less likelihood you’ll get it wrong.” She says the inspiration for the “crazy slapdash” vibe of her interpretation came in part from the Marx brothers’ movies. “It’s not your grandmother’s ‘Pinafore,’” she says. Kaupert’s infectious enthusiasm is reflected in the attitudes of her cast and crew. “With a show like this, people are doing it because they love it—it’s a lot more theatrical than a lot of shows,” says chorus member Aaron S. Graham-Horowitz ’15.
Ray applauds the musical for being “classical but not intensely overwrought,” characteristics that the HRG&SP will try to retain in their re-interpretation. But the bottom line, says producer Abigail A. Schachter ’12, is that “H.M.S. Pinafore” is “a boatload of fun.”

Since most Top-40 hits rarely reach for artistic greatness, the most popular music is often thought to be “bad music.” This is not entirely true. Artists like Ke$ha and Katy Perry are certainly vacuous, but they’re more inane than truly bad. Bad music is much rarer, and much more distinctive; one might easily forget the latest generic pop hit, but truly awful music is unforgettable.
“Lulu,” a collaboration between Lou Reed and Metallica, is unforgettable. It is wildly absurd and severely misguided. And though it’s tinged with an air of cruel apathy towards the listener, it still manages to be one of the more entertaining albums of 2011. It is bad in an almost hallucinatory sense; listeners may find it difficult to believe what they’re hearing.
Indeed, even on paper the project seems parodic—it can be safely said that no one predicted that Reed, a critical darling best known for his work with the Velvet Underground and for his 1972 solo hit “Walk On the Wild Side,” would make an album with Metallica, a heavy metal band that now threatens its fans with lawsuits rather than lyrics. The entire affair is tinged with an air of the surreal.
That tone is what colors the album and turns “Lulu” into one of the stranger records released thus far this year. Much of this can be attributed to Reed, whose lyrics mix the pretentious and the moronic. He begins the song “Brandenburg Gate” by lazily spitting out the soon-to-be immortal couplet, “I would cut my legs and tits off / When I think of Boris Karloff.” Needless to say, lyrics like this are not quite what his audience is expecting from him; in fact, lyrics like this are not quite what anyone expects to hear on a record. Adding to the strange atmosphere are Reed’s vocal performances, which can most accurately be described as atonal ramblings. Whereas his casual delivery once epitomized cool, now it sounds merely unengaged and lazy, as if this album were just another paycheck. With these subpar lyrics and lackluster tone, Reed has carried amateurism to almost unbelievable levels.
Comparatively, the signature over-the-top nature of Metallica’s instrumentals is less immediately noticeable. Though Reed’s mistakes are central to the record’s failure, the most fatal element of its strained and unreal atmosphere is the lack of interaction between the two artists. “Lulu” is a collaboration in the loosest possible sense. Both Reed and Metallica do appear on this record—usually on the same song. But the artists rarely step outside the boundaries of their established sounds. The album doesn’t feature either Reed shrieking like a heavy metal vocalist or Metallica trying to emulate the proto-punk sound of Reed’s singer-songwriter work. In fact, there is no synthesis or exchange of any sort—instead, the album is mainly composed of songs like the 11-minute “Dragon,” which sounds like a subpar Metallica song over which Reed’s craggy vocals are thrown. Instead of a collaborative work, this comes off as a incongruous mashup. Even worse are the songs where both Reed and Metallica vocalist James Hetfield sing. Their vocal interplay on tracks like “Iced Honey” is so stilted that it’s hard to believe the two were in the studio at the same time. And worst of all are the songs like “Little Dog,” which mainly consists of Reed ranting senselessly over drones and feedback.
All of this would suggest that even if “Lulu” is drivel, it’s drivel of the highest order—much like the film “The Room,” or the fictional musical-within-a-musical from “The Producers,” “Springtime for Hitler.” The album’s problems are so clear and so persistent that it would be very easy for the audience to see “Lulu” as nothing more than a massive joke. That’s certainly possible, as Reed’s phoned-in performance doesn’t imply that he’s artistically invested in the project. If this is the case, it’s a little slimy for Reed and Metallica to sell a deluxe edition that costs over $150—it’s streaming online, and soon enough the best parts will be spliced into an infinity of YouTube clips.

Working with someone who was hailed as a successful music critic despite being The New York Times’ youngest in the mid-1980s could be a rather daunting challenge. This is especially true of William Crutchfield, who has achieved a stellar record of accolades and esteemed positions, including director of opera for the Caramoor International Music Festival and faculty member at all three of the famous New York conservatories—Juilliard, Manhattan, and Mannes. Not only is Crutchfield a world-renowned American opera conductor, but he is also an author of an immense amount of scholarly work on performance in Italian opera. Yet this past Friday his gentle yet confident voice commanded presence and created a comfortable environment during the master class he taught for Harvard undergraduates as part of the Office for the Arts’ Learning from Performers series.
Crutchfield’s extensive repertoire of technical musical and vocal knowledge was fluently displayed as he inspired students to push the boundaries of their own vocal abilities. Sofia M. Selowsky ’12 said she found the class both enriching and enlightening due to his extensive knowledge of bel canto, a style of opera that focuses on the power of the human voice to tell melodramatic stories. “He knows Italian opera so well and focuses on performance practice, so it’s great if you have a question about an ornament or [want to ask] ‘Should I do this here?’ or ‘Can I sing this note here?’” she said. “He will be able to answer. Whereas some people just say what they think without really having the academic research to support it, you really know he is right.”
While Crutchfield joked throughout the various performances that he was there to torture the participants, his comments reflected the rigorous manner in which he relentlessly pursues excellence. His meticulous sensitivity to qualities such as timbre, vocalized consonants in Italian words, and breathing patterns spoke to his prowess as a true maestro and emphasized the underlying idea of the piece. “Whatever your idea is—whether it is sad or angry, intimate or public—all of [the ideas] have an intensity in common because of the sheer requirement that [opera] must be heard from a distance,” said Crutchfield. “There is a total range of sounds that the human voice can make, and then there is a subset of sounds that are resonant and can be heard at a distance. The entire artistry of opera has to happen within that subset, not the whole range.” In fact, as the students sang their pieces, he often stopped them at certain points to repeat verses and shared inventive practice techniques such as biting one’s finger to ensure proper shaping of the mouth or imagining having a potbelly to ensure serenity and depth of breath.
In a discussion after the performance, Crutchfield further explained what he intends to achieve in master classes. “What we try to do is get a few simple results very quickly so that the participants can take away something useful that maybe later they can develop in their own time ... and integrate it into a more organic process and achieve it on a more long-term basis.” This artistry distinguishes opera singers from mainstream pop singers, Crutchfield says. “A mainstream pop singer has a microphone and so the physical development of the voice is not really so important and may not be important at all ... There is no need to make the voice resonant and that’s a pretty profound difference. It’s not just a matter of louder versus softer, it also leads to different kinds of color or timbral qualities in the voice.”
Crutchfield’s acute analysis was not unnoticed by the participants. “It is always interesting to hear what he says because he has such fantastic insight,” said Stewart N. Kramer ’12. Kramer further commented that the experience of the class is not only based on one’s individual performance, but also on watching the other participants and learning from them. “What I get the most out of the class,” he explains, “is watching how [Crutchfield] works with other people, how he thinks they can improve and learn from [others].” In an intimate setting of around 30 people, Crutchfield was able to give singers these attentive suggestions while sharing his love for opera.
While opera may be distant to modern performers, Crutchfield said, it is still a worthwhile endeavor. “Even though opera is not really an art form of our time, the people who wrote [operas] created a body of masterworks that, for its own qualities, demands to be kept alive,” he said. “This creates a necessity to train and develop the kind of singers and actors who can do that.” And so on Friday Crutchfield gave Harvard students a slightly better sense of technique that will equip them to preserve the genre in the future.

Aphrodite, known to the world as the Greek goddess of love and beauty, seems to have found her home in the Torf Gallery of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. In an exhibit titled “Aphrodite and the Gods of Love,” curators Christine Kondoleon and Phoebe Segal honor the goddess and her impact on culture throughout history.
The introduction at the front of the gallery explains the collection’s purpose. “This exhibit is the first ever to consider how visual representations of Aphrodite evolved across antiquity.” This context provides a clear and succinct gateway with which to enter the exhibit. Aphrodite’s power and influence echoes through the well-framed structure of the exhibit and the deliberate pieces it holds.
Through a mixture of sculptures, urns, frescos, and jewelry, Aphrodite is depicted in all of her forms. Because the exhibit is organized thematically, it is possible to trace her development from the ancestors that inspired her to her birth and then, ultimately, to those who worshipped her. The diversity of artistic media echoes the various attributes attached to the goddess; beauty, passion, and fertility are all celebrated in this exhibit. For example, sculptural pieces like the “Head of Aphrodite (Bartlett Head)” and “Aphrodite of Capua” pay tribute to the classically soft, feminine features that Western culture has associated with beauty. These are juxtaposed with the more crude erotic urns depicting lovers overcome with desire sparked by Eros. As Eros is her son, this is yet another manifestation of Aphrodite’s power. These beautifully made but strange pieces are a thoughtful reminder of the range of powers that the goddess holds.
The young god Eros is shown both physically and through his power over civilians. This dual depiction, one tangible and the other abstract, is a common trend in “Aphrodite and the Gods of Love,” holding the exhibit together to undeniably positive effect. Aphrodite’s significance is found in her corporeal form and through her lovers, children, and even the beauty products she inspired. Also worth noting is “Statue of Aphrodite or a Roman Lady,” a weathered portrait modeled after what the Romans considered to be the physical traits of the powerful goddess.
These key pieces, among others, create a tangible flow, which not only provides an enjoyable viewing experience but also reflects how well the exhibit has been designed by the curators. Although the entire collection is confined to one room, the layout makes use of the entire space to emphasize the subject, which, as a singular entity, is better viewed in a smaller setting. The dark grey walls contrast appealingly with the white marble statues, while the subtle circular path within which the artwork is placed guides the audience first around the outskirts of the room, then eventually toward the center. Even the placards along the outer wall separate the exhibit into sections, each with information on a different aspect of the development of the goddess. This provides the audience with an easier way to assess the artistic value of the pieces.
Several pieces also promote the inferred visual lines within the exhibit. These lines not only connect key pieces, but also make them more accessible by complementing the flow of the exhibit. For example, Cupid and Psyche’s “First Kiss” fresco is the resultant focal point of the left side path of the exhibit, providing emphasis and promoting movement. Walking past this, one finds the “Statue of a Sleeping Hermaphrodite” sculpture. Its horizontal form is eye-catching and seems to point the way towards the rest of the pieces in the exhibit.
The exhibit culminates in the center of the room with its large-scale sculptural depictions of the goddess, as the ancients would have imagined her. Through these pieces, the accumulation of the historical development of Aphrodite and her lasting influence on the global ideas of love and beauty join to form a powerful conclusion to the exhibit. The curators’ desire to pay homage to these themes through this combination is rewarded by a unique and compelling exhibit.
The curators have provided a varied selection that successfully highlights the importance of Aphrodite to the development of classical art. With her mythic status promoting all that relates to the realm of love, the goddess has captured the fascination of artists, thus remaining a popular subject for them through the ages. “Aphrodite and the Gods of Love” uses both its structure and its content to honor this important symbol of femininity.

Girl in a Coma writes songs like dreams. In the moment, they are gripping, tense, and wild. They engulf you into their drama whether you like it or not. Yet after they’ve ended, there comes that eerily empty feeling that nothing really happened in the first place. There were thoughts and feelings and ideas and events that seemed at the time of dire personal importance—but all of a sudden it seems unclear what it was all about, what it meant, and what it was trying to say. The more you try to grasp onto something solid and sensical in the whole flurry, the less there seems to be.
This is not to say that their latest album is a nightmare—far from it. “Exits & All The Rest,” the Texan rock trio’s fourth release, features some powerful anthems and a couple of moving melodies. But the entire album comes off as an exercise in musical suspense and suggestion, a rock ramble that manages to evoke everything from coy sensuality to dramatic defiance without investing any of that with the least speck of importance.
The few victories of the album are due in large part to the vocal stylings of lead singer Nina Diaz, who has been singing with the group since being recruited by elder sister and drummer Phanie at thirteen. Nina’s skillful versatility lets her move seamlessly between the silken sultriness of Norah Jones and the husky violence of Joan Jett, also the group’s producer. Her softer side comes through best on mournful ballad “So,” which opens with a drunkenly swaying beat, lilting and confused. When Diaz slips into her first lyric—a thought about chasing rabbits that immediately recalls Jefferson Airplane’s “White Rabbit”—it’s almost as though she’s slipping into something a little more comfortable, as they say. You can almost see her lips caressing each word as it escapes her.
Her violent side, on the other hand, doesn’t fully bare its teeth until the anthemic album closer, “Mother’s Lullaby.” If Girl in a Coma does anything well, it’s suspense, and they put out all the stops for this breakup ballad. The song, which begins with slightly melancholy memories, slowly and tantalizingly builds tension into a defiant and embittered refrain. “You took from me all you had to take / Now you’re looking for the great escape,” Diaz wails at the climax.
Yet if Diaz the younger can take credit for much of the album’s appeal, she is also to blame for their eminently forgettable quality. It seems impossible for her to refrain from playing with all sorts of distorting and distracting vocal ornamentation. In an annoying sort of affected nonchalance, she twists her vowels out of shape and rarely bothers to touch her consonants, to the extent that her lyrics become absolutely incomprehensible. In her more impassioned forte moments, there is just no hope of understanding what she might mean.
The ostensible vocal indifference is by now a convention in rock, and it’s entirely forgivable on music with independent merit. But Girl in a Coma’s memorability problem is only compounded by their oddly inconsistent songwriting. They have a knack for beginnings—as evidenced, for instance, by the cleverly constructed counterpoint that opens “She Had A Plan”—but the real meat of each piece on “Exits” is essentially a repetitive series of standard rock refrains. Opener “Adjust” is, perhaps ironically, one of the worst culprits here. Then again, the jarring and thoughtless “Hope” gives it a run for its money, especially considering its incessant background cymbals.
There are, thankfully, moments of true creativity on this album. “She Had A Plan,” for instance, stands out as a successful deviation from the formula. A deliciously vicious mockery of youthful optimism, the song is a gorgeous mess of blaring guitar riffs, full-on howls, and lighthearted background vocals that call to mind dismissive and condescending laughter. And “Sly,” an intriguingly elusive portrait of coy refusal to feel guilty about breaking some poor man’s heart repeatedly, actually benefits from the haunting repetition of one line: “I couldn’t tell a lie / And I couldn’t tell a lie / And I couldn’t tell a lie / To save my life.”
Yet, as on all the other tracks, the final strains of “Sly” and the last of the blares on “She Had A Plan” fail to linger after they’re over. These songs may offer catharsis, maybe even intrigue, but they still lack melodic hooks, catchy beats, and insightful lyrics. They fade away into oneiric oblivion as soon as the music ends.

Before 2007, French electronic music was dominated by Daft Punk. However, in 2007, the world was formally introduced to the French electronic duo Gaspard Augé and Xavier de Rosnay who, under the name Justice, released their debut studio album, “†.” With its unstoppable combination of funky house rhythms and syncopated electro sounds, the album received great critical acclaim. Now, four years later, Justice has released “Audio, Video, Disco,” an album that, in all senses of the word, is sophomoric. An experimental blend of French electro, ’70s arena rock, and Italo-disco, Justice has created a compilation of tracks that together lack cohesion and individually lack finesse—two elements that were integral to the phenomenal success of their first album. Clumsy and juvenile, “Audio, Video, Disco” does not fall short because of the duo’s attempt to try something different. It is, however, just this experimental, trial-and-error quality and overwhelming disjointedness that sadly make it clear that the French electronic genre has seen better days.
In the months preceding the release of “Audio, Video, Disco,” Augé and de Rosnay revealed that the album would be “daytime music,” a non-aggressive, lighter version of “†” that would feature a slightly altered sound inspired by classic rock. What was expected to be a small shift away from the upbeat disco beats familiar to house music turned out to be an overindulgence in digitized guitar riffs and piano hits. The album’s fourth track, “Canon (Primo),” is a prime example of Justice’s immature emulation of rock music. The song begins safely, with the simultaneous pulse of bass drum and the rising scales of electric guitar. Then, in an effort to combine rock and electronica, it quickly shifts into an ugly mélange of interrupting cymbals, rhythmic bass, and jarring, abrasive guitar.
Though the group clearly strives for novel combinations of sounds, the initial excitement of their supposed innovation never evolves past the thrill of novelty. “Brianvision” is a notable offender. A calming yet unengaging introduction evolves into a continuous loop of the same sounds. The song lacks dynamics, and ends with little progression and no escalation. Indeed, many of the songs on the album display a rudimentary grasp of dynamics—these songs rarely transition within themselves, but abruptly change.
This process of devolution from gripping introductions into monotony is the pattern of “Audio, Video, Disco” as a whole. “Horsepower” and “Civilization,” the album’s first and second tracks, give a powerful introduction with their exceptionally careful transitions and precise juxtaposition of synthesizer and pounding bass. The ominous, crashing cymbals and guitar reverberations promise the biblically epic arrangements of “†.” However, almost as if there were not enough creative juice to continue, this impression eventually fizzles out as the album deteriorates into an unimpressive, pointless repetition of sound. The first two tracks display the potential of such experimentation due to their novelty, but just as “Canon” starts off high and ends in an anticlimactic finish, so too does “Audio, Video, Disco” fail to maintain the interest needed to execute such a starkly different style.
For their first album, Justice was applauded for prolifically manipulating the synthesized jazzy sounds common in the French house genre. Their well-delivered salute to Michael Jackson in their hit track “D.A.N.C.E” reveals the obvious precision and care with which Augé and de Rosnay complemented synthesizer with light piano and sanguine vocals. While there are a few successful tracks buried within “Audio, Video, Disco,” such as the Queen-reminiscent, mobbish pulses of “Parade,” the duo’s latest contribution to French electronic music does not live up to expectations. The intention to combine classic rock, electronic sounds, and upbeat disco requires great care and an abundance of creativity to carry out. There must be an incentive to give such experimentation a try—a clear artistic goal in mind. However, the incoherence of “Audio, Video, Disco” suggests that any clarity of vision was lacking.

After the debt crisis, when some congressional offices were downsized, the former congressional staffer by day and Brooklyn-based musician by night Danny Ross had a chance to change his life. No longer beholden to his nine-to-five grind, the 26-year-old singer packed up and began an #Occupy tour at CMJ in New York that will take him all the way to Virginia. On Sunday evening, he played his #OccupyBoston show at T.T. The Bear’s Place in Cambridge.
The political philosophy behind this tour centers on two principles: that inequality has created a world in which finance is the only safe profession and that everyone should become an artist and stay an idealist. Ross’s call to artistry stemmed from his grueling work in the Congressional office of Jerrold Nadler, a New York Democrat.
“Then, I was up until 2 a.m. writing and practicing music. And I did this every day for 5 years,” Ross said.
Two years ago, Ross self-released an album, “One Way,” and has obtained a record deal with  indie label Ammo Records. Ross believes that inequality is not only a problem for traditional careers, but also for musicians in that the industry no longer aids up-and-coming artists.
“There used to be a system and infrastructure in the music industry that would take care of you. If you practiced and played good music, you would be all right,” Ross explained. “Now, you have to be your own publicist, frontman, music director—and on top of that, you need money.”
Ross’ former occupation in the Congressional office prepared him for the managerial aspects of making it as an independent musician. However, now that he has left, he has abandoned bureaucracy in favor of an ideal.
“Art is not a small business,” Ross said. “It has cultural significance, and more importantly, good art doesn’t have a bottom line.”
On Sunday night, Ross performed with a nine-man brass band, his set alternating between original Springsteen-inspired rock anthems, swaggering country beats, and covers of classic R&B and folk songs. Many of these songs were staples of protest music. Ross’s cover of “The Banks are Made of Marble” —a song famously performed by Pete Seeger—was the most poignant, with its message of dissolving economic barriers, and featured sadly timeless lyrics—“Then we’d own those banks of marble / With a guard at every door / And we’d share those vaults of silver / That we have sweated for.”
Another standout was his cover of Sam Cooke’s “Bring It on Home to Me,” which showcased the technical prowess of the brass section and added variety to the rock sound of the show. Surprisingly, all of the numbers featured an insatiable shuffle beat that added a “working-man” country vibe to the show. Sadly, due to the somewhat constricted space, many of the lyrics were lost in his group’s big sound, but Ross reconciled this difficulty through charmingly predictable stage banter.
However, the spirit of protest music and art in politics seemed a little lost at the end of the night, whether by fault of the venue or the audience. While Ross maintains he’s not a protest musician in the oft-emulated style of Bob Dylan strumming his guitar at an outdoor protest, it felt strange that Ross was not playing at something closer to the site of Occupy Boston itself. While Ross had the skill and vocal prowess to impress a crowd, a small music club in Cambridge was closer to the 26-year-old Cornell University grad’s own demographic of well-educated young people apprehensive about the future than it was to the Springsteenian blue-collar, working-class man Ross seems so eager to reach.

Performing a fugue or making one up on the spot—which is more impressive? What about reading a speech or making one up? Reciting an excellent joke or improvising an entire scene? Not much is more awe-inspiring than seeing a new creation made right in front of your eyes. Invention requires a tremendous amount of skill, and spontaneous invention magnifies the perception of talent. “Improvisation is the ultimate mindful act,” says Harvard Psychology Professor Ellen J. Langer.
In a sense, we unknowingly improvise daily. Maybe the clearest example of this fact is human interaction: we all invent ideas while conversing. “Without this type of creativity, humans wouldn’t have advanced as a species,” said Dr. Charles J. Limb of John Hopkins University, as quoted in a Johns Hopkins press release. “It’s an integral part of who we are.”
Luckily, we have gained a myriad of techniques since childhood, such as changing our voice tone and body language, learning idioms, and building a vocabulary, which we call on instantly whenever the need to improvise arises. However, the ability to improvise art is not essential to daily life. It takes careful planning and practice to assimilate artistic technique so thoroughly that an artist has a vocabulary and set of patterns to call on effortlessly. “To be completely fluent on an instrument is similar to speech,” says jazz pianist Chase E. Morrin ’15. “It’s like talking through the instrument.” Just as mastering a language elicits a certain mindset, thorough knowledge of an art form and its technique amounts to an alternate mindset for processing the world.
But can donning this new mindset affect the minds of improvisers outside the performance arena? What parts of the brain are activated and deactivated during improvisation and why? By studying such questions, psychologists and doctors have gained insight into improvisers’ minds. The data accumulated suggests that the path to fluency in an improvisational form, although arduous, can positively affect the improviser away from the stage by freeing up his imagination and loosening the pull of inhibitions.
PURSUIT OF A PALETTE
An improv troupe performing a 10-minute scene based on the word “lizard,” a blazingly fast Charlie Parker solo, and a verbal annihilation of an opponent in a policy debate all provoke a central audience question: “how the hell did they think of that?” Yet, to artistic improvisers, there is no thinking, at least not in the technical sense that we would expect.
“When I’m performing, thinking becomes more of an abstract thing where I’m trying to focus on the vibe of the room and the general direction I want to the music to go,” says Morrin. “All the specific things I practice become just a palette that I draw from when I’m improvising.” Morrin suggests that there are far too many technical possibilities—what notes would be acceptable for a certain chord, what substitutions would harmonically develop the piece, what fingering is required for a certain passage—to consciously register while spontaneously creating. These possibilities must instead be an immediate resource, like a painter’s palette.
While in music the best way to acquire technique is concrete and widely known, there is no single or obvious way to acquire improv comedy skill. The Immediate Gratification Players (IGP), one of Harvard’s numerous improv comedy groups, dedicates a large percentage of its practice time to simple technique exercises. IGP focuses mainly on body language, space definition, and conveying social status within a partnership. “Improv technique is about training your instincts so you can be more and more on the scene,” says Ari D. Brenner ’14, an IGP member. “You don’t want to do any cognitive thinking.” The comedy in improv comedy arises mainly from how accurately and smoothly the players convey a preposterous scene or idea; thus, a huge portion of practice time is spent on exercises that allow the improvisers to forget they are improvising and focus on conveying the scene itself.
Like IGP players, policy debaters are actors of a sort. Every speech and statement at a debate is essentially an acted monologue. At debate tournaments the speakers seem like a combination of energetic actors and refined politicians. Their actions and speech become excessively animated all while improvising arguments at up to 500 words per minute. At this pace, thought is no longer an option; the debaters must rely on their instincts and previous knowledge to win. “The most important thing when you’re debating is to develop the ability to pick your best argument,” says debater Sandesh K. Kataria ’14. “You have to think on your feet a lot, since you’ve just heard a flutter of arguments at 500 to 600 words per minute and need to choose which points to debunk and how.”
A successful improviser must be able to internalize fully his or her technique to the point that it can be called on automatically. Improvisation, however, is not a solitary art. The artist must also master careful listening.
“NO ROADMAP”
Improvisation is a team sport. Although it is easier for the audience to judge a single improviser’s skill while he or she is soloing, improvisers often consider one’s ability to support a solo equally vital and difficult to master. For Brenner, the best improv comics are not solo artists. “A common misconception is that to be a good improviser the one and only criteria is to be funny. In my opinion the best improvisers are excellent listeners; that’s the number one skill.” Improvisation is an art form with no safety net and a high risk factor. Thus, the best improvisers must always be attentive and focused on their fellow improvisers in order to lower the probability of error.
Unlike traditional jazz, in which chord changes are written out, free jazz has no guidelines at all. This lack of structure multiplies the probability of error as well as the importance of listening. For Andrew J. Katzenstein ’13, who plays free jazz, having a great ear and listening to his fellow performers is a crucial aspect of his art. “Musicians get into a situation and start playing. There’s no discussion, there’s no roadmap, there’s no music. Somebody plays and others just go ahead and continue.” A free jazz improviser must be able to hear and assimilate effortlessly both the melodic and harmonic ideas in his head with the sounds produced by his peers. To combine these two trains of thought musically is a strenuous intellectual test. When asked to comment on Dr. Langer’s statement that “improvisation is the ultimate mindful act,” Katzenstein responded, “I totally agree. In order to be a good improviser you have to be aware, totally keyed in to your surroundings. It takes a very, very profound knowledge of yourself and other people.”
Katzenstein notes that great improvisers must pay careful attention to their own musical output. In many improv forms, cultivating the ability to predict in your head what you will perform is the most difficult skill to master. Morrin’s improvisational style is focused on replacing traditional chords with complex variations. “What I try to do is hear individual voices and hear their own movement,” he says. “How you resolve these individual voices is the crux of jazz.” Morrin, who has been playing jazz piano for 10 years, says he finds the ability to hear the movement of these individual voices the most elusive skill.
How to best resolve a Cmaj13 chord to a Bbmin9 may seem hard to Chase, but for an audience member trying to imagine the artistic and psychological capacity to improvise is just as difficult. Luckily, science allows us to peek inside brains in the midst of spontaneous creation.
OPTIMIZING THE TRANCE
The sight of an improviser is an easy one to conjure. Their eyes are often closed in thought, they are swaying in a trance to their performance, and at the highest level they seem completely at one with their art. Why should improvisation evoke such a trancelike state? Recent research shows that by shutting down parts of the brain that determine inhibitions and turning up parts that facilitate creativity, improvisers reach a state that allows them to be optimally creative and free.
A Johns Hopkins study called “Neural Substrates of Spontaneous Musical Performance: An fMRI Study of Jazz Improvisation” used functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) machines to scan jazz musicians’ brains while improvising and not improvising. While playing back a previously memorized passage, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which controls self-inhibition and consciousness, was highly active. Such areas of the brain would be activated in a job interview or awkward social situation. Interestingly, while improvising, these inhibitory parts of the brain were nearly shut down in the musicians. This absence of activity in this self-conscious brain region was coupled with increased activity in the medial prefrontal cortex, a region connected with expressions of personality, such as storytelling. This result was the same whether the musician was told to improvise alone on just a simple C major scale or whether he was allowed to improvise freely in any key with a full jazz quartet. The conclusion is startling: even the slightest modicum of improvisation shuts down inhibitions and amps up creativity.
An video on the website of the British science and art organization the Welcome Collection, “The Science of Improvisation,” shows that the levels of activity in the inhibitory regions of the brain are identical while dreaming and improvising. This fact explains both an improviser’s apparent dream-like state and his or her ability to perform with such uninhibited freedom. This creativity also manifests itself in daily life. “A lot of musicians improvise outside of their instruments” says Katzenstein. “Improv is a way of life, not just a music thing. It comes across in how they talk to people.”
MINDFUL MANNER
The improvisational lifestyle, if adopted, can have numerous positive benefits for the breadth and utility of our imaginations. “For the past 40 years I’ve been studying the mindlessness of actions,” says Langer. “The research makes it clear that mostly all of us are mindless nearly all the time.” By using the word “mindless,” Langer implies that most people go through the world without the sense of presence that allows for them to notice or create new things. To Langer, improvisers seek and perform the novel rather than repeat trite, overdone combinations.
To Alfonso Montouri, author of the “The Complexity of Improvisation and the Improvisation of Complexity,” an article published in the journal Human Relations, the avoidance of such repetition is really what drives creativity. “Creativity involves constant organizing, disorganizing, and reorganizing,” he writes in the article. “It involves actively breaking down assumptions, givens, traditions, pushing boundaries and moving out of comfort zones.” For Montouri, then, all creative ventures are inherently improvisational.
Langer once did a study with an orchestra to learn whether or not being “mindful”—defined earlier as choosing new combinations—made the performers and audiences happier. On one run members of the orchestra was told to play a passage mindlessly by “remembering a time you played a performance extremely well and replicating it.” On the second run the musicians were told to play the passage mindfully by “playing it inventively in a way you would do best.” When the recordings were played back to test listeners, the listeners overwhelmingly favored the mindfully played recordings. The musicians also said they preferred playing mindfully.
The search for fresh perspectives not only increases happiness but also mental stability and problem solving. “According to the research, creative persons score higher both on measures of pathology and of psychological health,” says Montouri. “In other words, they have access to a much broader range of human experience.” “Science of Improvisation” also finds that improvisation has a positive impact on problem-solving abilities and improvisers in all art forms often have heightened verbal and spatial abilities directly after a performance. Most research on the effects of improvisation on the mind can be summarized simply: even small amounts of creative thinking and improvisation makes people smarter and happier.
We often go through our lives “mindlessly,” seeking only to get through the day. But what if every lesson, every conversation, every experience was as original and novel as an improv performance, a policy debate, or a jazz solo? The musicians Katzenstein knows live this ideal: “they push themselves and try not to repeat themselves; they try to be fresh as musicians and as people.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The American judicial system has received more attention than usual in the current presidential election cycle. In the Republican field, the candidates have vehemently criticized federal judges for overextending their judicial authority: Rick Perry called for term limits for Supreme Court justices, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum advocated the abolition of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and Michelle Bachmann and Ron Paul want to prevent the federal courts from hearing cases about same-sex marriage. But at the crux of the Republican criticisms lies a paradox: The federal courts, and particularly the Supreme Court, have been incredibly favorable to conservative causes in the past few years.
The responses to the Republican talking points are just as illuminating as the points themselves. While a New York Times opinion piece took the Republicans to task for attempting to restrict the power of the federal courts, the editorial ended with a stinging criticism of the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission decision—claiming that the justices had vastly overextended their authority by allowing corporations to make unlimited campaign contributions. Republicans want to restrict a court system whose overreaching has created a favorable political environment for the social causes they hold most dear; at the same time, many of those who reject the Republicans’ restrictions have been on the losing end of the federal courts’ most controversial cases from the past half decade. Why the divergence in views?
Part of the reason is that both sides of the political spectrum have the same fundamental critique of recent judicial decisions: These rulings have overextended the rights of certain citizens or groups at the expense of others. For conservatives, this overextension has enabled citizens to make broader claims on the federal government, leading to the kind of government expansion that has been the focus of Tea Party attacks. Liberals, on the other hand, fault the courts for facilitating an unprecedented expansion in corporations’ rights.
From the conservative perspective, a prime example is the Food Stamp Act. In the 1970s and 1980s, the act was interpreted liberally by the courts to require additional expenditures by the Department of Agriculture. Essentially, federal courts manufactured a statutory “right” to an adequate diet, moving beyond Congress’s original intent of supplementing inadequate diets. This judicial intervention had foreseeable consequences: Once the issue was framed as one of rights, food stamp recipients had an immediate trump that could be used to justify increased benefits regardless of the social costs (i.e., higher taxes, more spending). For a Tea Party base insistent on deficit reduction and budgetary reform, the judicial expansion of citizens’ rights to publicly funded benefits is an appealing talking point for Republican candidates.
But liberal critics have an equally valid point: If the courts have interpreted citizens’ welfare rights expansively, they have been equally careless in their interpretation of the rights of corporations. Allowing corporations to make unlimited campaign donations is another decision whose consequences were overlooked. By asserting a corporation’s absolute “right” to donate to campaigns, the Supreme Court cut off a valuable dialogue about how to balance the right to contribute with citizens’ rights to participate in campaigns on an equal footing.
What we can learn from both sides in this debate is that we need to focus on more fundamental changes. Providing Supreme Court justices with term limits or abolishing the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals may serve one candidate’s political objectives by swaying the courts in a particular direction; however, it will not resolve the broader problem of a judicial system that constantly elevates citizens’ claims about “rights” without considering the corresponding rights that are trounced upon in the process.
We need to encourage politicians to avoid framing every issue as one of rights, to stop appealing to the courts to resolve these issues, and to avoid rhetoric that encourages the kind of adversarial legalism that has led to increased litigation of personal and political issues in the past several decades. And the courts need to step back from the judicial creation of rights—whether it’s a right to privacy, a right to social welfare, or a right to make campaign donations. It’s this avoidance of the absolute rhetoric of rights that will enable us to have a sustained national dialogue about some of the important social issues facing our nation—not the short sighted judicial reforms envisioned by the current Republican field.

Having participated in three major elections as a Massachusetts voter, what has intrigued me most about the voting process, besides the raised eyebrows I get from Cantabrigian poll workers when they see my party affiliation, is that no personal identification is required. When I arrive at the polling place in Quincy House, the election officials do not ask to see my driver’s license. They just verify that a “Peyton Miller” is registered in the precinct, hand me a ballot, and direct me to a voting booth. I realized after voting for the first time in 2008 that my roommate, who is from Kenya, could have claimed to be me and voted in my place.
In the Bay State, a photo ID is mandatory for tasks as mundane as buying a beer and acquiring a library card but is considered superfluous, or even poisonous to the most sacrosanct aspect of democracy. Fortunately, most states don’t see it that way. Thirty have instituted some form of identification requirement aimed at preventing voter fraud, and sixteen have passed laws requiring voters to present photo ID. This year has seen a trend toward tighter restrictions. Three states have passed new ID laws, and four others have upgraded to a photo ID requirement. By imposing a minor inconvenience on some citizens, these new laws will crack down on voter fraud and boost public confidence in American elections.
An identification requirement is a simple way of preventing voter impersonation (i.e., pretending to be a different voter), voting under a fictitious name, double voting by individuals registered in more than one state, and voting by illegal immigrants. While the extent of such fraud is disputed, it is known to occur on a sufficient level to tip the balance in close elections. In 2010, for example, a state representative election in Kansas City, Mo. was stolen when an interpreter at the polling place coached fifty Somali nationals to vote for one of the candidates, who ended up winning by one vote.
On a much larger scale, the Colorado secretary of state’s office recently found 11,805 aliens illegally registered to vote in the state, of whom nearly 5,000 had cast ballots in 2010. And in 2004, an investigation by the New York Daily News revealed that some 46,000 New Yorkers were registered in both New York and Florida, and between 400 and 1,000 of these had voted twice in at least one election. Recall that George W. Bush won Florida in 2000 by only 537 votes.
One reason the incidence of fraud appears sporadic, as the U.S. Seventh Circuit Appellate Court explained in upholding an Indiana ID law, is that the absence of identification requirements needed to detect voter fraud breeds “endemic underenforcement” of election laws. Perhaps just as important as upholding these laws is maintaining public faith in the democratic process. In the 2008 Cooperative Congressional Election Study, 62 percent of voters sampled thought voter fraud was very common or somewhat common. Authenticating voters’ identities at the polling place would help reverse this perception.
The elephant in the room is the true motivation behind such laws. Commentators from Bill Clinton to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People to editorial pages across the country have characterized these tighter restrictions as a Republican plot to depress turnout among Democratic constituencies, particularly racial minorities.
Given this country’s history of racism, any revision of polling place procedures should be subject to scrutiny. But broad support for stronger voter ID laws makes the “scheming GOP” narrative hard to swallow. A Rasmussen poll from earlier this year found that 75 percent of likely voters nationwide, including 63 percent of Democrats, believe citizens “should be required to show photo identification” before voting. So does Rhode Island state representative Jon D. Brien, a Democrat who earlier this year shepherded a new voter ID law through an overwhelmingly Democratic legislature. Recently retired Alabama congressman Arthur G. Davis, an African-American who once opposed his state’s new photo ID requirement, now supports the law as an antidote to the voter fraud he has witnessed in parts of the Black Belt.
These restrictions create another bureaucratic hoop for some voters to jump through, but comparing them to Jim Crow laws, as the NAACP’s Benjamin Jealous and others have done, is quite a stretch. Organizations on different sides of the issue have produced varying estimates of the number of eligible voters who lack a photo ID. But regardless of the true number of such citizens, those who wish to vote need only obtain proper identification from a government office, a service offered free of charge to those unable to pay.
Reasonable people can distinguish between these laws, which merely compel some citizens to stand in line at the post office and the literacy tests and grandfather clauses of the Jim Crow South. In Congressman Davis’s words, voter ID requirements are “unlikely to impede a single good faith voter.” While they are an inconvenience to some, these laws are an effective way of protecting the most fundamental component of our form of government.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With Turkey’s prospects for joining the European Union stagnating, the country is reaching out to Muslim and Arab countries as an alternate form of political and economic support. In this light, Turkey can serve as a role model for the Muslim world and for neighboring Arab countries. Although Turkey is not without its problems, it is unique in being a secular, Islamic democratic nation that should set its own course, without looking to the European Union.
Motivated to join the E.U. for decades, Turkey has implemented many democratic reforms to meet the acceptance criteria. Since 2000, the country has passed a plethora of modernization laws to meet the level of international standards, including laws abolishing the death penalty and the reforming of human rights.
Additionally, Turkey has eased its authoritarian restrictions on freedom of expression and the press, while recognizing some minority rights. While all of these improvements represent moves in the right direction, other problems still plague the Kemalist-turned-Erdoganist republic. To take one, ethnic tensions involving the Kurdish and Armenian communities remain, a testament to the current government’s shortcomings.
Despite Turkey’s clear ambition to enter the E.U., Europe’s Christian-majority countries have repeatedly shunned the largest Muslim European country with chapter after chapter of new rules for entry.
These same E.U. gatekeepers now seem to worry that Turkey is turning away from Europe after many decades of implementing social and cultural reforms. Having kept Turkey out of the European Union for so long, one might ask: Is the West justified in complaining? I don’t think so.
The E.U.’s continuous rejection of Turkey is in line with an anti-Muslim attitude spreading across Europe. This can be seen in France’s and Switzerland’s recent bans of the headscarf (Switzerland’s ban still must be approved by the upper chamber of parliament), and Germany’s (former) longtime denial of citizenship to Turkish immigrants—many of them second or third generation Germans.
These countries have been extremely intolerant toward their Muslim minorities. While many Germans indict Turks for not integrating into their culture and society, until 1999 they also denied Turks born in Germany the right of German citizenship by birth, due to the fact that they were not ethnically German. Many Turks in Germany have complained of the difficulties of living between two worlds, speaking of a feeling of being unwanted.
In an essay titled The Fading Dream of Europe, Orhan Pamuk, a Nobel laureate in literature and arguably one of Turkey’s most controversial figures, describes his upbringing in a country that dreamt of entering Europe. Pamuk notes that the dream is fading fast, although no one is willing to admit that Turkey’s hopes of joining the E.U. are nearly lost.
The likelihood of Turkey ever making it is so slim that any discussion on this subject is futile. Turkey’s identity crisis between the East and West is still as prevalent as it was centuries before when it served as a bridge between civilizations. While the country has a foothold in Europe, it is not European at its core.
Possibly due to the onerous hurdles it has faced in its journey to formally join the E.U., Turkey has slowly turned to Islam. The current diplomatic standoff between Turkey and Israel, once an ally, has reached an intensity never before experienced between the two countries, after Israel refused to apologize for killing eight Turkish civilians aboard a Turkish flotilla to Gaza in May 2010. Turkey has since responded by downgrading diplomatic and military ties with the Jewish state and expelling the Israeli ambassador from Ankara.
Furthermore, Turkey has supported the revolutions in Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya while defending the Palestinians’ rights in their bid for statehood in the United Nations. This has many asking if Turkey, once seen as a bridge between the East and West, is a secular Muslim democracy turning religious and Eastwards?
Culturally, today’s Turkey is closer to its Arab counterparts than its European ones. Moreover, it stands as proof that democracy and Islam are compatible. Turkey should not abandon the Western facets of its identity, even though there seems to be no point in continuing in the endless negotiations to join the remnants of Europe’s other empires in the E.U. Rather it should set its own course and stand as a role model for the Muslim and Arab worlds.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Transparency has been a long time coming. In 2003, The Crimson filed a lawsuit against Harvard University, demanding that the Harvard University Police Department release its crime reports to the public. Represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, the newspaper argued that Harvard’s police should be subject to state public records laws like all municipal police forces. Three years later, in 2006 and after protracted litigation, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled unanimously in favor of Harvard, citing HUPD’s status as a private police force. In doing so, the court dealt a major blow to this newspaper’s and others’ calls for greater police transparency. The University’s argument that HUPD is different from other police forces because its governance and rules fell under the auspices of an educational institution and were designed to protect students’ privacy, were deemed valid. At the time, The Crimson argued that legislation should proceed to correct an anomaly that allowed Harvard and other Massachusetts universities following Harvard’s lead to block sufficient public access to law enforcement data.
This year, five years after that judgment, a bill has been introduced in the Massachusetts House of Representatives precisely to this effect. Bill H.1740 would require “records, reports or other documentary materials or data made or received for the purpose of law enforcement by a special state police officer of a college” to be subject to the same disclosure rules municipal police departments face. This would, of course, apply to HUPD, which currently just releases a daily police log and annual statistics. To date, the bill has passed the state Senate and is in committee in the House. The Crimson has long argued and campaigned for holding Harvard’s authorities to the same exacting standards of transparency and accountability as their peers across the country. The House of Representatives should pass this bill in its current form and put an end to an anomalous and troubling disconnect between HUPD and its neighboring police forces. HUPD and the Cambridge Police Department patrol side-by-side, often in the same areas, and hence deal with the same problems. It simply does not make sense for them to be subject to different disclosure rules.
As members of the public and of our campus community, as well as in our role as journalists, The Crimson staff has long argued that institutional accountability should be of the utmost importance. The case for HUPD transparency has never been founded on a suspicion that Harvard’s police force deserves particularly harsh scrutiny. Rather, HUPD should be subject to the same disclosure rules as other forces because transparency and accountability in policing are virtues themselves. The fact that Harvard is a college campus should not obscure the reality that our police force functions as any other and ought to be treated as such.
In the case of police forces especially, more transparency ought to constitute a positive development. In normal circumstances, journalists and other interested members of the public can and should use police reports to identify and put together a more coherent narrative of the crimes that take place in our community. Reporters and citizens attempting to identify more precisely the locations that can be deemed crime hotspots and what sorts of activity are repeated at these locations can never get anywhere near the full picture from truncated logs.
Harvard has argued in the past that greater disclosure of police activity on campus would be detrimental to students, but Harvard’s attempted defense of students does not quite add up. When other police departments release reports and records, they routinely redact specific identifying information related to crimes. If the state were to compel HUPD to release more information, it is not clear how student privacy will be compromised.
Overall, a community stands only to benefit from more holistic access to reports of incidents and police action. Police accountability and transparency are nationwide issues that unite many journalists, activists, and members of the public from across the spectrum. Massachusetts’ legislation comes as a welcome development, and we look forward to its passing and implementation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two Harvard Law School graduates and social entrepreneurs shared their experiences creating and developing non-profits with a crowd of about 60 students at the Law School on Monday.
Earl M. Phalen, who graduated from HLS in 1993, and Adam T. Stofsky, who graduated in 2004, spoke at the event.
Phalen is the CEO of Reach Out and Read, a non-profit that encourages doctors to push their clients to read out loud to their children. He has founded and managed a number of charities, and was awarded the President’s Service Award for outstanding community service by President Bill Clinton.
After graduating from the Law School, Stofsky clerked for an appeals court judge before founding the New Media Advocacy Project (N-Map)—a non-profit that draws attention to social injustice.
Both speakers urged the audience to think about non-profits like businesses. They offered practical advice: write compelling grant applications, promote promising leaders, solicit friends and family for financial support early on, and develop strong networks while at Harvard.
“At the time, I didn’t like the concept of pretending to be friends with people in case they did well 10 years down the line,” Phalen said. “Now I wish I had done more of that.”
Both speakers agreed that there is room in the marketplace for new non-profits.
Even in cases in which a charity already exists, creating a similar organization can help foster competition and drive down prices, they said.
But they also said that individuals can make an impact within existing organizations.
“Think carefully about whether you want to start up your own organization if there are already eight out there that are doing the same thing,” Stofsky said.
The Law School graduates also warned the audience that running an upstart charity can be frightening at times.
“Be ready to feel the type of uncertainty that you don’t necessarily get when pursuing a law degree,” Stofsky said.
At least one student appreciated this message.
“Hearing from two individuals who actually committed to taking a risk was really refreshing in an environment where we’re taught to not fail,” said Harvard Law School student Neil K. Rao.
Both Phalen and Stofsky strongly recommended developing a business background, especially before taking on for-profit projects.
“Learning about and studying cases can give you an advantage that’s incredibly useful,” Phalen said. “Every bit of it counts.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Marines tend to be harder-edged, more mission- and goal-oriented,” says Cambridge City Councilor Craig Kelley as he reflects on his experience in the U.S. Marine Corps.
Though Kelley is no longer in military service, he applies this mission-centered mentality to his current political campaign. The incumbent candidate, who has been on the City Council for six years, boasts a wide-reaching agenda for Cambridge, including plans to strengthen the relationship between the school system and local government and to increase safety for pedestrians and bikers.
Overall, Kelley unites his platform by framing his proposals as a new vision for Cambridge.
“We need to figure out how to have a one-theme view of forming a citizen,” he says. “We can’t make the world a perfect place, but we can be deliberate about our words and behavior.”
Focused initiatives and intentionality characterize Kelley’s approach to local issues. After serving in the Marine Corps for almost five years, the Wellesley, Mass. native shifted his attention to environmental concerns and worked for Greenpeace. He then pursued his interest in sustainability at Boston College Law School by joining the Environmental Law Society.
Since 2008, Kelley has worked as an environmental compliance specialist at Innovar Consulting.
In November 2005, Kelley successfully ran for a seat on the Cambridge City Council, and with another election now approaching, he acknowledges the wide range of problems facing Cambridge.
“We reflect a lot of society’s issues,” he says. “This is the place in the world to be someone making policy decisions.”
During his time in office, Kelley has worked on the transportation committee and helped develop a traffic enforcement and management tool for the police department. The new system is used to process queries about motor vehicle violations and compare activity at different intersections.
“This allows us to be more intentional,” Kelley says.
Additionally, he has led efforts to itemize funding in the schools’ transportation budget.
“We can’t give away money and have no idea what it means,” Kelley says. “We need to have discussions about spending.”
Education has played a major role in Kelley’s political career and is a key component of his current campaign platform.
“Cambridge is making the future,” he says. “These kids will be cosmopolitan leaders.” Nonetheless, Kelley notes that residents are leaving the Cambridge public school system for various reasons, including the lack of academic rigor, poor classroom management, and the need for improved training for teachers.
Kelley added that while watching the graduation ceremony at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School in June, he observed that “most of the kids that had National Honor Society certifications looked like me.”
In order to boost the MCAS scores and academic performance of minority groups, Kelley has pushed for increased access to academic resources such as the library system.
“We’re failing,” he says. “We need to do a lot more reaching out.”
Kelley identifies similar problems within the criminal justice system. “We’re jailing young black men—it’s a terrible statistic.”
To combat local crime, Kelley aims to create a stronger partnership between the public and the police to deter criminal activity and encourage more consistent enforcement of laws. “We need to be intentional and be honest without being judgmental,” he says.
In discussions of the social and economic problems within Cambridge, Kelley constantly returns to his wish to transform the city by creating “well-formed citizens.”
“We need to figure out how Cambridge can form an environment where you don’t react by shooting,” says Kelley. “We need to create a new culture and environment for how we treat each other.”
At the same time, Kelley understands that his ability to improve Cambridge is limited. “The danger is that I’m the white Irish guy and my societal norms may not be yours. We need to be cautious.”
Since Kelley took office, he has frequently attracted controversy. Often casting the sole dissenting vote, the incumbent candidate has disagreed with other City Council members on various proposals, most recently on the North Cambridge zoning law and affordable housing formula.
“I’m known as Mr. 8 to 1,” says Kelley. “But that’s life. I like to think that they are opportunities for me to help the Council recalibrate its thinking.”
Kelley also has openly disagreed with Cambridge City Manager Robert W. Healy, writing in a statement that Cambridge needs a city manager with “a long range vision for our City rather than a time-sensitive, reflexive ‘stay the course’ response.”
Nonetheless, Kelley says that whether or not he is reelected, he will find ways to execute the changes he envisions.
“I’m not losing a leg or an arm over this,” he says. “If I believe something is wrong, I will fix it.”
Kelley currently lags behind the other incumbent candidates in campaign donations, with contributions totaling $275 as of late September.
Kelley maintains his hope that Cambridge become a “world where people can access all of the opportunities.”
“It’s tough for a white guy from Wellesley to come and change the world,” Kelley says. “But it’s also hard for him to be quiet.”

“Green collar” jobs, forums for students, celebrations of diversity from Haiti to Ireland—all on a frugal budget. These are the ongoing projects of Councilor E. Denise Simmons, who will be running for her sixth term on the Cambridge City Council this month.
The top priority in Simmons’ reelection campaign has been the quality of life in Cambridge. She has initiated and continues to support projects that work toward security and prosperity for city residents in various stages of their lives. This includes quality education for children, affordable housing for families, opportunities for small businesses, and public services for seniors.
“I have always been a loud and forceful advocate for those I represent,” Simmons writes on her campaign website.
Simmons has been in public service since the 1980s, serving on civics and school committees. She first joined the City Council in 2002 and served as Mayor of Cambridge from 2008 to 2009.
“I think my ability to relate to people, and to translate that to effective advocacy, is one of the reasons voters keep returning me to City Council,” Simmons says.
As a lifelong resident of Cambridge, Simmons has experienced many of the situations that her constituents now face. She describes herself as a small business owner, a wife, a mother, a grandmother, and an activist. She has faced the challenges of each of these roles and hopes to continue bringing that experience to the Council.
As the owner of a small insurance business, Simmons believes that “micro enterprises” are essential to growing communities. However, Simmons also promotes the creation of so-called “green collar” jobs: skilled jobs that she says are not easily outsourced and pay good wages. To this end, she has secured $100,000 for green job training and placement programs.
As a mother and grandmother to children currently and formerly enrolled in Cambridge public schools, Simmons has promoted dialogue about improving the quality and accessibility of education.
Simmons has been a strong supporter and key player in the Kids’ Council, which brings Cambridge residents of all ages together to discuss family support centers and youth engagement efforts. As part of her support, Simmons has tapped into the vast educational resources provided by Cambridge’s universities. For example, graduate students at the Harvard Kennedy School advised the Kids’ Council in 2009 during the development of its three-year strategic plan for improving opportunities for Cambridge’s children and young adults.
As an activist, Simmons says her dedication to public service stems from a belief in the power of citizen involvement.
“I have always believed in the power of civic engagement. ... This is what got me involved in community activism,” says Simmons.
In addition to her own participation over the last three decades, Simmons encourages other members of the community to become actively involved in local politics. As Mayor, Simmons created a Citizen Advocacy Program to teach Cambridge residents about civic engagement. As a public official, Simmons also encourages citizens to interact with her—inviting individuals, for example, to speak with her one-on-one about traffic and parking issues. Part of her reelection campaign includes going door-to-door to listen to the concerns of Cambridge residents and offer her proposed solutions.
Simmons finds individual participation in government important because of the wide array of cultural and political beliefs represented in Cambridge.
“One of the things that’s really complicated but also wonderful about Cambridge is that it is so incredibly diverse,” says Sally Haslanger, an MIT philosophy professor and Cambridge resident who has collaborated with Simmons on several community projects.
As the first black and openly lesbian mayor in America, Simmons is a symbol of that diversity, says Haslanger. However, Simmons also seeks ways to actively promote dialogue on the diversity in Cambridge. One of her projects as Mayor was the creation of the Prince Hall Memorial, a monument to an overlooked African-American Revolutionary War hero and civil rights activist, which now stands in Cambridge Common.
During her service as a city councilor, Simmons has also had to deal with the issue of race in a less positive light. In 2009, the arrest of Harvard Professor Henry Louis “Skip” Gates Jr. in front of his house pushed the issue of diversity to national headlines. Simmons was interviewed by a number of national news outlets about the arrest. Even after the subject faded from the headlines, Simmons pushed to ensure such events would not be repeated, taking measures to implement the recommendations of the commission appointed to study the incident. Many constituents at the time responded positively to Simmons’ handling of the situation.
“She’s someone who has walked the talk, lived the talk, and I think that everybody can see that,” says Haslanger.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After graduating college, Henrietta Davis decided to pursue higher education by going to graduate school in social work, influenced by the beginning of the environmental movement in the 1960s. Davis, a self-proclaimed activist for sustainability, sought to learn how to move an issue forward.
While filling out her application to Boston College’s Graduate School of Social Work, she was stunned when she saw that she had to pick between two focuses—community organizing or counseling. She took a pencil and checked off community organizing with the thought, “Well, that sounds like me.”
“I went to graduate school in social work to become a change agent. That’s how I see myself,” Davis says.
That check mark helped shape Davis’ career. She has worked to promote change in her community through her experiences as a city planner, a Cambridge School Committee member, and founder of the Healthy Children Task Force. Now, she is running for re-election for a ninth term on the Cambridge City Council.
A HEALTHY CITY
Serving on the Council since 1996, Davis’s policies have continually focused on healthy living and a sustainable environment. Davis says she sees herself as being ahead of the curve. She analyzes trends in Cambridge’s population to decide what they will need for a better future.
When first elected to the Council, Davis says she was on the “earthy, crunchy agenda” but has since seen a shift in interest on sustainability issues across the Council.
“When I came to the Council, people were just starting to pay attention to climate change,” Davis says. “Everyone was doing it, but now they’re embracing it,” she adds.
Davis says she was one of the first Cambridge city councilors to encourage sustainability through policy change. In early 2000, she supported a policy that required all new buildings in Cambridge to be LEED certified.
“I want to make Cambridge a model green city,” Davis says.
Davis’ initiatives for this year include labeling the “green” level of Cambridge buildings, improving the energy efficiency of district heating in schools, and educating residents about energy saving practices.
Beyond Cambridge, Davis has taken trips to Europe to learn about sustainability. She recently attended a conference in Hamburg, Germany, where she learned about making public transportation safer, cheaper, and more efficient.
Davis worked as an administrator at Agassiz Preschool from 1985 to 1994 and was elected to the school committee in 1988. She founded the Healthy Children Task Force in 1990, a community group that has led public health initiatives for children. Davis still serves on the board.
Davis also supports improved services for seniors and greater housing options. This new initiative was prompted by shifting demographics in Cambridge, which has seen an influx of older residents.
The major themes of Davis’ campaign are “greening” the city and supporting the health of children and seniors.
“It was inductive rather than deductive. I came at these ideas from different vantage points, and I see a sense of urgency in all of them,” Davis says.
BROAD EDUCATION
While studying social work, Davis learned about the process of change and used these skills in her career as an urban planner and later on the school committee.
She decided to broaden her education at Harvard Kennedy School 20 years after receiving her masters’ degree, obtaining a scholarship and taking courses that would be flexible with her home life.
Her education at the Kennedy School, culminating in a masters in public administration, gave her a new set of skills for approaching policy issues. A course titled “To Be A Politician” pushed Davis to pursue a career in politics.
Davis says her education has made her more policy focused, and she envisions improving the city through policy changes.
“I feel like I’ve been infected by HKS,” Davis says.
During her time as a City Councilor, Davis says she has had great experiences working with the University.
“The University and community egg each other, prompting higher standards,” Davis says.
YOUR NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR
After eight successful campaigns, Davis says she tries to make each of them social, fun, and useful for her community.
She publishes literature—a newsletter, useful numbers card, farmers’ market card, and a savings for seniors brochure—that not only includes her campaign message but also serves as information to Cambridge residents.
“I feel like what I do should be useful,” Davis says.
Her background in journalism also inspired her campaign literature.
After working for Cambridge as a neighborhood planner out of college, Davis decided to try something else and answered a newspaper advertisement to be a freelance writer for a police magazine.
Since that first freelancing job, she has worked for Time, Life, Money, and NPR.
“There are lots of similarities between being a journalist and an elected official. You need to research and communicate effectively,” Davis says.
Davis grew up in Newton, but moved to Cambridge immediately after completing her undergraduate degree and has lived in the same house since 1969, developing close relationships with her neighborhood from the beginning.
“Cambridge is a wonderful small city full of opportunities beyond measure. Everyone else wants to live here—why wouldn’t I?” Davis says.

The Sierra Club recently announced its endorsement of seven of the eighteen current candidates for Cambridge City Council.
The environmental organization endorsed Henrietta Davis, E. Denise Simmons, Minka vanBeuzekom, Craig Kelley, Tim Toomey, Sam Seidel, and Matt Nelson. Of the seven, six were also endorsed in 2007.
Nelson, who currently works for the Massachusetts League of Environmental Voters, was the only new addition to the list. He said that instigating environmental change was one of the reasons he chose to run for office.
Nelson, a Cambridge resident, said that he thinks Cambridge can be an environmental leader in the state. One of his initiatives, he said, would be to enforce existing Cambridge green legislation such as recycling laws and time limits for idling cars.
Phillip Sego, the state political chair for the Sierra Club Massachusetts chapter, said that each candidate for city council was sent at least two invitations to apply to receive an endorsement.
James Williamson, a Cambridge resident running for city council, has publicly claimed that he did not receive an invitation. He has also taken issue with the way the Sierra Club gave out endorsements this year.
Williamson said that he was disappointed because he had a “large interest in environmental issues,” both as a candidate and as an individual.
Responding to Williamson’s complaints, Sego repeated his statement that the Sierra Club sent invitations to all candidates.
“I don’t believe he sent me anything. I most certainly would have responded,” Williamson said, adding that if he is mistaken, he would like to see the email.
Sego stressed that the Sierra Club endorses environmental candidates on a large number of qualifications.
“It’s not [just], does someone claim to be green? Or, have they done one green thing?” he said. “I don’t think there’s anyone on the planet who’s against the environment. Our criteria is who’s best.”
The city council election will take place on Nov. 8 and the final Candidate Forum is this Wednesday at 6:30 at the Senior Center in Central Square.

Candidacy declarations for the Undergraduate Council Presidential Elections closed last night, revealing that two UC insiders—Danny P. Bicknell ’13 and Crystal D. Trejo ’13—will compete for the presidency, along with outsider candidate Samuel Melton ’13.
Bicknell, who is the UC Student Relations Committee chair, will be pairing up with UC Treasurer Pratyusha Yalamanchi ’13 as his vice-presidential candidate. The duo will be contending against Trejo, the UC Social Programs Task Force Chair, and her vice-presidential candidate David H.A. LeBoeuf ’13, UC Rules Committee Chair and a former Crimson news writer.
Both tickets boast years of UC experience, and each candidate in the lineup is a Council veteran in a high-level position.
“The fact that all of them have a lot of experience is good for the Council because it means they know how things function,” said UC Secretary Michael C. George ’14, who is also a Crimson news comper. “They know how to make tangible promises but stay visionary.”
Having both served on the Council since freshman year, Bicknell and Yalamanchi enter the competition with the most UC experience.
During his time as Student Relations Committee Chair, Bicknell has worked to streamline UC functions by improving the UC’s social communications, helping facilitate administrative and student communication through town hall discussions, and incorporating student input into the UC’s projects.
Yalamanchi, a third-year FiCom member and second-year Treasurer, has played a major role in shaping this year’s budget. According to her profile on the UC website, Yalamanchi hopes to develop policy guidelines for funding student-initiated J-term efforts, fund more cross-campus social space initiatives, and increase the transparency and accessibility of the grants process.
Trejo exemplifies similar leadership capabilities. She was selected to head the newly formed Social Programming Task Force in February upon its creation. The task force, which aims to improve social life on campus, organized a series of social events last semester, including a surprise carnival and “Lights Out,” a campus-wide dance.
LeBoeuf—a transfer student from Clark University in Worchester—is a relative newcomer who recently joined the Council last semester through a special election in Pforzheimer House. Despite his mid-year arrival to the UC, LeBoeuf immediately assumed his position as the Chair of the Rules Committee as well as a member of SPTF.
Melton enters the race without any experience on the UC, and the same is true for his vice-presidential candidate, Maxwell P. Campion ’13.
Despite the discrepancy in combined Council experience between the tickets, several UC members say they believe that this year’s presidential election will be a very close race.
“Being on the UC for three years doesn’t necessarily mean you have the most to bring to the table or that you are the most informed person,” said Christopher A. Devine ’13, UC Student Life Committee Chair. “Coming from a different school, David offers a different perspective and brings a lot of new and unique ideas, making it a fairly even race between the two UC tickets.” Members also predict that the elections will center around two key issues: social space and increased dialogue between students and administrators.
“I think that at end of the day, both tickets are going to focus on the same two issues that were the focus of last year’s election because those have become key topics that students and the Council have expressed concerned about,” George said. “It will just be up to the candidates to decide how to convince the student body that their vision is better than the other side.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a Saturday afternoon several weeks ago, Christopher C. Walleck ’14 momentarily regretted his decision to enroll in six classes.
He had four midterm exams in one week and a Computer Science 50 problem set that needed 20 hours of work.
“I sat down and asked myself, ‘how on Earth am I possibly going to get through this?’” Walleck recalls. “It seemed, at that moment, impossible.”
But Walleck survived. After finishing each midterm, he studied through the night for his next exam. He says he finished the week with only 5 hours of sleep in 120 hours. After grinding through his last midterm on Friday, he went to sleep at 2 p.m. and woke up 21 hours later.
Looking back on his academic marathon, Walleck—both self-assured and self-deprecating about his decision—affectionately refers to the experience as his “worst week at Harvard.”
Despite his hell week, Walleck—an East Asian Studies concentrator—says that a schedule of six courses has made his sophomore fall an “enriching and challenging” endeavor.
While most students at the College enroll in four courses each semester and hundreds more take five, Walleck is 1 of only 20 undergraduates at Harvard enrolled in six or more courses this semester, according to data provided by the Office of Undergraduate Education.
Many Harvard undergraduates struggle to meet deadlines for four courses. But, every year a small coterie of students, unsatiated by the normal academic course load, craves something more. Voluntarily, they dedicate themselves to a schedule 50 percent greater than the College demands—that means more lecture, more section, more homework, more midterms, more papers, and more exams.
“It takes a very strange person to want to take six classes,” said James H. Sun ’14—a member of the six class elite.
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR CHALLENGE
Students who take six courses in a single semester say they are motivated most fundamentally by a desire to challenge themselves academically.
Some, like mechanical engineering concentrator Rachel D. Field ’12, say their decision is catalyzed by a single experience.
Last year, Field spent winter break in the Himalayas testing a solar lantern that she had helped design that previous fall in an independent research project.
At the end of her trip, she returned to campus inspired by her experience in the Himalayas—and decided to enroll in six courses to further explore the concepts she had worked on during her trip.
“I was just so motivated,” she recalls. “A couple of the classes I took last spring were driven by specific academic questions.”
For example, after some locals struggled to use her lantern that winter, she decided to take a CS class on user interfaces to improve her project design.
Other students, like Samuel J. Bakkila ’11-’12, say they take extra courses to help choose a concentration.
Bakkila, who is now pursuing a special concentration in public health, entered his sophomore spring undecided about what he wanted to study. He had been a prospective Social Studies concentrator in the fall, but returned to school eager to explore psychology. He enrolled in six courses that semester—including three psychology classes, a statistics class, a history of science class, and a research class in a moral cognition lab.
Beyond exploring a particular interest or concentration, many students say that they opt to take six courses for a simple reason: they love learning.
Archaeology concentrator Zenab R. Tavakoli ’12, who typically enrolls in four or five courses and audits between one and three more, says she enrolls in so many courses because she is “an enormous nerd.”
Tavakoli talks quickly, trying to cram as many words as she can into a single breath. With her busy schedule, she’s always in a bit of a rush.
“It’s kind of weird,” she muses. “A lot of people are on open lists, saying ‘what’s an easy class to take?’
‘And I’m like, ‘no, I don’t have time for these nothing classes. There are too many that I want to take.’ It’s the worst.”
GETTING THE GO AHEAD
The College makes it easy for students to take six classes—provided that their resident deans think they are up to the challenge. Undergraduates looking to take six courses in a single semester must contact their resident deans before study card day to get their schedule approved.
Students who want to take seven or more courses face a steeper challenge—they must petition the Administrative Board to get approval.
Resident dean of Adams House Sharon Howell receives about three or four requests each semester from students in the House looking to take six or more courses.
Howell says she considers students’ past academic performance when deciding whether to give them the go ahead.
“Usually, I, and the students other advisers, can talk him or her out of it if I really think it’s a bad idea,” she wrote in an email.
Christopher A. Hopper ’13, a premed linguistics concentrator, hoped to enroll in six classes at the start of the semester.
Hopper said he wanted to take six courses at the beginning of this fall to challenge himself and find room for additional courses in a schedule packed with required courses.
But when he met with his resident dean, she refused to sign his study card, saying she wanted him to focus on improving his grades in the two premed courses he would be taking that semester instead of attempting to take a sixth class.
Hopper said he was disappointed for the “first two minutes” after his meeting with his resident dean, but chose not to contest her decision, and enrolled in five courses.
With the time he would have spent on a sixth class, Hopper decided to “reinvent” himself by joining a new extracurricular activity. This fall, he rushed the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic fraternity.
Hopper says he still plans to enroll in six courses his senior fall, when he will be finished with his premed requirements.
Like Hopper, Walleck faced an uphill battle trying to convince his advisors to allow him to take six courses. Walleck said his academic advisor and resident dean initially discouraged him from taking six courses, particularly because three of his proposed courses were electives.
Eventually, however, Walleck’s advisor and resident dean consented because he was so adamant to go through with his plan.
He recalls, “They said, ‘you can take 6 classes only if you must,’ and I said, ‘I must.’”
FRESHMAN ADVISING
Unlike upperclassmen, freshmen must take exactly four academic courses in the fall. They can, however, petition their resident dean to take a fifth course only if it is a music performance class.
“We’re really protecting students from themselves here,” Dean of Freshman Thomas A. Dingman ’67 explains. “We want people ... to end up feeling like their feet are on the ground solidly at the end of the semester.”
Every spring, however, Dingman says that an average of one or two freshmen seek to take six or more courses in their second term at Harvard.
Applied math: economics concentrator Sun, now a sophomore, was one such freshman. Last spring, he enrolled in six classes, including two applied math courses, a statistics course, Expository Writing 20, Economics 10b—an introductory macroeconomics course, and Chemistry 20—an honors-level chemistry course.
He said while his freshman resident dean was wary that he would be spreading himself too thin, he said he thinks his request was ultimately approved, in part, because he had earned a 4.0 in the fall.
‘DOABLE’
Some students who have survived six classes call the experience a manageable challenge.
“I think people overestimate the difficulty of taking six classes, really,” organismic and evolutionary biology concentrator Nicolas Maffey ’13 says, completely serious. “If you choose the right classes, it’s really doable.”
This semester, Maffey is enrolled in six courses—two Organismic and Evolutionary Biology classes, a global health class, a chemistry class, a psychology class, and an English class. He is also a varsity gymnast at MIT and president of the Harvard Organization for Latin America.
Before coming to Harvard, Maffey went to high school in Argentina, where he, like all of his classmates, took ten courses each semester.
“When I tell I my parents back home that I’m taking six courses, they don’t think it’s insane or anything,” Maffey says. “They just say, ‘cool.’”
Like Maffey, government and philosophy joint concentrator Theodora M. Skeadas ’12, who has enrolled in six classes the past three semesters, says she is able to balance a heavy workload with an active extracurricular and social life.
Limited to only 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, Skeadas says she found time to direct the PBHA program Mission Mentors, run regularly, practice yoga and meditation, and even go out on Friday and Saturday nights—all while still averaging eight hours of sleep every night.
She says this busy schedule has forced her to improve her time management skills, leading to better grades with six courses than she had earned with only four classes.
But Skeadas admits that there are limits to how much she can do.
“If you’re taking six classes and expecting to do all the reading for it, it’s not going to happen.”
LIFE OUT OF BALANCE
While some students emerge unfazed from a semester of six classes, others say they would never do it again.
Bakkila says that the semester he enrolled in six classes, he participated in essentially no extracurricular activities and cut back substantially on his social life. He also “worked consistently” through spring break.
“It was a semester of all work and no play,” Bakkila recalls.
When grades came out at the end of the semester, Bakkila anxiously waited to see if his semester of unyielding academic focus had paid off. His grades started to appear on the registrar’s website. The first five came in: A, A, A, A, A. After several agonizing days passed, finally the last grade appeared on the registrar’s website: A-.
“When I got it, I just about burst down crying because I was so close to six ‘A’s,” Bakkila says, almost mournfully.
In every semester since then, he has taken four courses in an effort to “move back to a better life balance.”
Bakkila is now co-chair of Queer Students and Allies and co-director of the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter.
“I’m glad that I pushed myself to do one semester of six classes, and I’m glad that after that I pulled back and reintegrated myself into extracurriculars and social life,” Bakkila said. “My time here is valuable.”
Unlike Bakkila, Sun says he did not cut back on his extracurricular and social commitments during his six-course semester. Instead, during his spring semester, he went out more frequently on weekends and got more involved on campus—becoming director of recruitment for the Harvard Financial Analyst Club, volunteering at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, serving as treasurer for Harvard College Faith in Action, and joining the Asian American Brotherhood during his six-class semester.
But the experience, he said, took a toll. Accustomed to eight or nine hours of sleep each night, Sun averaged only six hours of sleep that semester.
“There were some days I would just sleep through section,” Sun recalls. “It was terrible.”
“I was there, I did the work, I got good grades, but I wasn’t really learning too much,” Sun recalls. That semester he earned four A grades and two A- grades.
His thinking now has changed.
“It makes more sense to take less classes, to devote more effort to each of them.”
This fall, Sun enrolled in four courses.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The alcohol policy committee expects to submit a draft of a comprehensive new Harvard alcohol policy by the end of the school year, according to committee head Rakesh Khurana.
Khurana said the committee is currently in the “listening and understanding period” of the review process and said that, as a result, he could not yet predict the extent to which the revised policy will deviate from the College’s current rules regarding alcohol.
“We’re pretty early on in the process,” said Khurana, who is also a Cabot House Master. “Right now what we’re trying to do is facilitate conversations and understanding about how we can help support and develop a philosophy around alcohol policy at the College.”
Once completed, the draft of the new alcohol policy will be sent to Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds for final approval.
Over the coming year, the Office of Student Life will hold conversations with Harvard students in an effort to generate student feedback on Harvard’s drinking culture.
Administrators said they will convey comments to members of committee.
Ari L. Rubin ’13, who attended the first such meeting, held last month among students from Kirkland, Eliot, and Winthrop Houses, said that he was encouraged by “the willingness of the administration to listen to what we as students have to say.”
“The conversations are important because we as students are the ones being impacted by the decisions,” said Nicholas L. Moore ’13, who also attended the meeting.
Final policy decisions will fall to the members of the alcohol policy committee, which includes Khurana, administrators, and a small number of students.
The committee was formed last spring in conjunction with administrators’ efforts to address unhealthy drinking habits in the undergraduate community.
Over the past three years, admittances to UHS for alcohol-related sickness have been rising, reaching the entire total for the 2009-2010 academic year by the end of the 2010-2011 fall semester, according to tutors who learned the statistics from College administrators during a residential tutor meeting.
Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson said the College is interested in reevaluating the current alcohol policy in the context of creating a healthy social scene while still remaining within the boundaries of the law.
“How do we create and ensure the well-being of our students. ... That is the goal,” Khurana said. “We’re working backwards towards that goal.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dressed in an off-white billowy shirt, ripped up khaki pants, and a dirty blue vest, Sarina M. Patterson ’14 portraying Captain Jack Sparrow was a physical manifestation of the lively Halloween festivities that occurred on Harvard campus on Monday.
“Apparently I was very convincing, because my professors didn’t recognize me, my friends didn’t recognize me, and tourists kept stopping me in the yard to take pictures with me,” Patterson said, who also sported a leather tri-corner hat with white cloth bandages wrapped around her hands.
Though most students chose to dress in costumes over the weekend rather than for Halloween day, many activities for the holiday still occurred throughout the day.
For their annual tradition of reverse trick-or-treating, members of the Harvard Radcliffe Science Fiction Association walked around freshmen dorms, visiting students door-to-door as they passed out candy behind a prop door.
“People open their doors to find our door in front of them. When they knock, we open it, coo over their costumes, and give them candy,” said Jason R. LaRue ’12, a member of HRSFA.
“Some people say it makes their night or makes their Halloween,” added LaRue, who dressed as an old grandmother to pass out candy, wearing a white, floral wool sweater, white mop cap, and baby powder white hair. “They tell us they miss trick-or-treating, so we’re really hoping that it improves the freshmen’s lives that we’re doing it, too.”
Harvard University Dining Services ensured that upperclassmen, too, could end their Halloween feasts with a sweet treat. House dining halls offered caramel apple stations with two different types of apples, caramel dipping sauce, and an assortment of toppings.
Students in need of a caffeine break later on in the night dropped by the Cabot Café Halloween Extravaganza, where customers received free candy with any purchase and had the chance to vote for their favorite costumes in the costume contest.
Patterson was declared the winner of the contest at the end of the night.
“Your costume is really only limited by your imagination and how well you can pull it off,” she said.
To set the Halloween mood, Cabot Café was decorated with banners, pumpkins, and dry ice, while a Halloween-themed playlist, featuring songs like “Ghostbusters” and “Monster Mash,” was played for the customers.
“[Sunday night], right at midnight, we blasted ‘Thriller’ on the speakers to celebrate the beginning of Halloween,” said Jesse J. Kaplan ’13, co-founder and general manager of Cabot Café. “We definitely scared a bunch of the customers, but it was worth it.”
Various dormitories, including Currier House and Pforzheimer House, offered trick-or-treat events for their residents, while the Sparks House hosted a Halloween event with classic and gourmet candies, encouraging students to come in costume before heading over to Memorial Church for the Harvard Organ Society’s annual Halloween Organ Recital at midnight.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Projecting a photograph of a classic Spanish dessert menu for the audience to see, Chef Carme Ruscalleda began Science and Cooking’s twelfth guest lecture by sharing a secret.
“By browning an ingredient, we bring it to a different level of taste,” she said in Spanish as a translator interpreted her remarks. “Food acquires a different taste and becomes more sophisticated.”
Ruscalleda is the only female chef who currently holds six Michelin stars, and is one of only four women who have ever received the distinction.
This week’s Science and Cooking lesson centered on the Maillard reaction—a process of heating similar to caramelization that causes food to turn brown. In a brief scientific overview before the lecture, Harold McGee, who authored the course textbook, explained the concepts underlying the reaction as it unfolded on stage.
“It’s very complicated,” he said, referring to the pan on the table. “It’s sugar and water in a pan with heat.”
He lifted the stirring spoon as the audience laughed, revealing a sticky and dark brown substance. Sugar and water, heated long enough, had turned into caramel.
“To me, that’s the magic of cooking,” McGee said.
Ruscalleda, who is the course’s only female guest chef, then went on to explain the significance of this browning reaction in her own cooking. In strong, passionate Spanish, she shared four recipes with the audience—garlic tapas, pasta, migas, and polvorón—all of which showed the effects of browning.
Though Ruscalleda used photographs instead of giving a live demonstration, audience members saw each recipe’s step-by-step process in five times the speed. This allowed the chef to cover more of her recipes.
Ruscalleda, who was born to a family of farmers and shopkeepers in Catalonia, Spain, continuously emphasized the influence of culture and geography on her cooking throughout her talk. Her restaurant, Sant Pau, is located in her hometown and is known for its specialization in Catalan cuisine. Another branch of the restaurant is located in Tokyo, Japan.
While Ruscalleda is known for bringing contemporary innovations to traditional dishes, the chef also said that her aim is always to provide healthy, tasty, and well-prepared cuisine.
“Her food is inventive and creative,” said Science and Cooking Professor David A. Weitz. “But it’s also more traditional than others, and that’s why so many people like it.”
Pep Vicente, who works as the interpreter for Science and Cooking’s guest lecturers, said that Ruscalleda is not only an incredible chef—she is also an incredible person.
“She’s a very difficult mix to achieve,” Vicente said. “She’s very down-to-earth, but at the same time, she has a certain elegance and sophistication.”
People who attended the event said that they enjoyed hearing Ruscalleda talk about her cooking, despite the fact that she needed a translator.
“Some of the other [guest chefs] looked to create something very sophisticated,” said Science and Cooking student Sam R. Peinado ’15. “[Ruscalleda’s] cooking seemed to be more based on her surroundings, and I liked that.”

Students at Harvard Business School joined the long list of supercomputer Watson’s victims in a game of Jeopardy!  Monday on campus—but they went out with a fight.
The HBS students competed against Watson and MIT Sloan students as part of an information technology symposium featuring Watson’s creator IBM and hosted by the two schools.
The team, comprising Jonas P. Akins, Jayanth J. Iyengar, and Genevieve M. Sheehan, took second-place in the tournament with a total score of $42,399, losing to Watson’s $53,601.
But the Harvard team outplayed its MIT counterpart, which came away with $100.
Watson drew an early lead in the game, correctly answering questions in categories such as “Who’s Your Daddy Company” and “Tech-Tonics.”
But on a high-value Double Jeopardy question—”What type of ball was the fictional character Wilson in Cast Away?”—the HBS team temporarily took the lead by $3,000 before eventually falling to Watson.
Sheehan and Iyengar, who have both also competed on the broadcast version of Jeopardy!, commented on how the experience with Watson compared with their experiences on the show.
“The TV lights that they use on the set are much brighter,” Sheehan joked. “But there’s still that similar feeling of excitement, though now in front of a live crowd full of your peers.”
Jeanne Y. Hwang, an HBS student in the audience cheering for the team, said that she found the team’s performance to be commendable.
“I was very impressed by the showing of both teams, especially HBS,” she said. “The students were able to compete so well against a machine that’s been programmed with nearly limitless information. It goes to show how wide our breadth of knowledge is, even though we don’t have Watson’s ability to rapidly process data.”
Watson, named after IBM’s first president Thomas J. Watson, was developed by a team of researchers using IBM’s DeepQA technology, which allows Watson to answer questions that are posed in natural languages.
To test its abilities, Watson appeared on Jeopardy! in February in the first ever match-up between human and non-human contestants.
Containing four terabytes of disk storage, including every entry published in Wikipedia, Watson beat his record-holding competitors, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings, to win the tournament’s $1 million prize, which IBM donated to charity.
David Ferrucci, the principal investigator of the research team that built Watson, discussed the development process on Monday.
He said Watson, like humans, has the ability to learn through interaction with others, but can process data and draw conclusions much more quickly.
“It’s amazing to see how the machine gets smarter by interacting with its users,” he said. “A human has to weigh multiple decisions when looking at data, though, while Watson has the ability to do so instantaneously.”
Bernard S. Meyerson, the vice president of innovation and academic programs at IBM, said that the technology behind Watson has the potential to revolutionize the healthcare industry by diagnosing users.
“If someone were to present [a rare] disease, a doctor would have to spend months researching the symptoms and effects of it,” he said. “Watson, though, has the capability to process all of the writings on the disease at once and can produce a diagnosis in a fraction of the time.”

Over 400 Harvard-affiliated custodial workers signed a petition “in support of a just contract,” which a delegation of approximately ten custodians and union members then presented to University President Drew G. Faust’s office on Monday.
Although Faust was not available, the group said they put the petition in her dropbox and asked her assistant to pass along their concerns to Faust.
The presentation of the petition comes in the midst of University contract negotiations with SEIU Local 615, the union which represents Harvard custodians. Matthew Gulish, an organizer for Local 615, said that the impetus behind the petition was anxiety that many custodians are feeling over what he called “dragging” contract negotiations.
“Basically, these negotiations aren’t going quite as smoothly as we would like,” Gulish said. “This delegation will hopefully help speed things along.”
The University said that it is focused on creating a negotiations process that is mutually beneficial for workers and for Harvard.
“We are proud of the strong relationship that exists between the institution and its unionized workers,” wrote University spokesperson Kevin Galvin in an emailed statement. “We are optimistic that the negotiations will be productive for both the University and the people who help to make it one of the world’s premier institutions for research and education.”
Members of the delegation said that they presented the petition to Faust in hopes that she will expedite and support them in their quest for what multiple delegates called a “just contract.”
“We need a contract and it doesn’t seem anything is moving,” said Facilities Maintenance Operations custodian Jean-Claude Mondesir. “We want her to help us get a fair contract. If she says something, it will happen.”
Among custodial demands in the contract are increased full-time work opportunities, an end of perceived favoritism and the equalization of benefits between direct employees of Harvard and subcontractors—custodians hired through non-Harvard agencies such as the FMO.
“We want one Harvard,” said Local 615 organizer Sergio Deunas. “We hope that by reading that petition the president will realize that workers really need her support.”
Galvin said that the University is proud of its current agreement with both direct employees and sub-contracted employees, noting that the University has a “progressive” policy with regard to the latter group. Harvard’s Wage and Benefit Parity Policy accords contracted workers the same pay and the same time off and benefits as direct Harvard employees, including access to the University’s “Bridge to Learning and Literacy” program.
Delegates said that the presentation of the petition was not meant to be a confrontational act, but was instead a request for a show of unity from the president.
“We don’t think they want to divide us,” Mondesir said. “We are hoping the president will show her support for a contract the gives us dignity, equality and fairness.”

In a new weekly feature, The Crimson will be tracking the successes  (and potential failures) of some of Harvard’s most successful graduates  not to use their Harvard degrees. While a tour through professional  sports is not exactly a who’s who of Harvard alumni, a few athletes have  taken their game to the next level. From Jeremy Lin to Ryan  Fitzpatrick, the Crimson maintains a presence outside of the labs and  law offices of the world.
With the Bills coming off a bye week, our alumni tracker once again resumes its focus on the team’s quarterback, Ryan Fitzpatrick.
This week was a big one for the Harvard alum, who managed to secure a six-year, $59 million contract on Friday. The contract includes $24 million in guaranteed money, and could be the most lucrative in Buffalo Bills history.
And on Sunday, he began to earn his money.  Fitzpatrick threw for 262 yards and two touchdowns, finishing 21-for-27 on the day as he led the Bills to a 23-0 win over the Washington Redskins.
Tight end Scott Chandler was on the receiving end for both of Fitzpatrick’s touchdown passes. The Harvard grad also was able to bounce back from a big hit in the first half from Redskins linebacker London Fletcher, coming back to set up a Bills field goals right before the end of the half.
Playing their annual game in Toronto’s Rogers Centre, the Bills improved to 5-2 on the season, moving into a first place tie with the Patriots in the AFC East.
It seems like the Bills have finally found a starting quarterback they are willing to commit to, with Fitzpatrick earning the first extension for his position with the Bills since Doug Flutie did in 1999.
It’s only fitting that the Bills are off to their best start at home since 1995, when Jim Kelly—the last stable quarterback the Bills had before its revolving door of journeymen and veterans—took the snaps.
With this new contract, Fitzpatrick is no longer another “no-name” quarterback but a legitimate NFL starter. “Fitzmagic” has arrived.

With 10 seconds remaining in a 1-1 game against Dartmouth last Saturday, sophomore midfielder Peyton Johnson smashed a 28-yard free kick past Big Green goalkeeper Tatiana Saunders. The goal gave the Harvard women’s soccer team the win and assured the Crimson at least a share of the Ivy League title and a berth to the NCAA tournament later this month.
Miss Johnson’s goal? Probably, because it was raining and freezing, and it was Halloween weekend. Never fear, our friends at GoCrimson.com just posted the video of the championship-sealing goal. Check it out!

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every championship team needs players who can make the big plays when it counts the most. Adam Vinatieri’s last-second field goals for the Patriots, Dirk Nowitzki’s buzzer-beating jumpers for the Mavericks, and most recently, David Freese’s home runs to help the Cardinals win the World Series.
For its game against Dartmouth last Saturday, the Harvard women’s soccer team looked to sophomore midfielder Peyton Johnson to provide the late game heroics.
With 10 seconds remaining in a 1-1 game, Johnson drilled a 28-yard free kick that beat the wall and the goalkeeper, giving the Crimson the 2-1 win.
The result, along with Penn and Brown’s 0-0 tie later in the day, assures Harvard at least a share of the Ivy League title and a place in the 2011 NCAA tournament.
For Johnson, winning the Ancient Eight crown, something the Crimson did not do last season, has always been the goal.
“All the freshmen and sophomores look longingly at the upperclassmen’s rings from their freshman or sophomore years,” Johnson said.  “We have always wanted one of our own. This season has been a great one, and to cap it off with getting a ring is huge.”
Before Harvard’s win Saturday, the standings at the top of the Ivy League were tight. With the Quakers and Bulldogs nipping at its heels, the team knew how crucial this game would prove for its season.
“The Ivy League is interesting because we do not have a [conference] tournament, so each game is like a playoff game,” co-captain Lindsey Kowal said. “We knew we needed a win because Penn was right behind us by one point. We had no room for error.”
Under steady rain, the game went into halftime level and looked destined for overtime before a Big Green foul 10 yards outside the box set up Johnson’s free kick.
The midfielder guided the ball over the wall of Dartmouth defenders and past diving freshman goalkeeper Tatiana Saunders, a member of England’s U-19 National Team who has never lost a game in international competition.
“[Saunders’ record] just shows that regardless of who she is going up against, Peyton can deliver,” Kowal said.
As the ball passed Saunders, a wave of emotion hit Johnson.
“It was almost disbelief,” the sophomore said.  “I remember seeing the net ripple, and then turning around and freaking out. I don’t think I processed the gravity of it.”
This last-second goal was not Johnson’s first game-winner of the season. The sophomore fired a penalty kick past Yale in overtime earlier this month to gain another crucial league win.
But Johnson was quick to credit her teammates for those successes.
“The fact that I had the game winners [against Yale and Dartmouth] is not the important thing,” Johnson said. “They were both late goals, and there was a whole 90 minutes before them that paved the way. They were also both 2-1 games, so someone else scored first, and that gave me the chance to do my best for the team.”
An ever-present part of the squad, Johnson has played in all 16 games for the Crimson this season, starting in 15. Tied for third on the team with 13 points, Johnson has tallied four goals in total this season and three assists, two of which came in September’s 2-0 win over reigning Ivy League champs Penn.
That game, Harvard’s first conference match of the year, set the tone for the season as the Crimson has gone undefeated in league play (5-0-1) and undefeated in general play since Sept. 18.
“Peyton has a huge presence on the team,” Kowal said. “Not only does she play a position that controls the tempo of the game, but also her personality is addictive. She’s a very emotional player, which helps raise the level of our team … Her confidence is unparalleled.”
In anticipation of the season’s final Ivy League match-up at Columbia this Saturday, Johnson said that she and her teammates are going into the game in a unique position.
“It’s an interesting balance of a lack of pressure and complete pressure, because we’ve already secured the championship and the NCAA berth,” she said.
But despite their comfortable position, Johnson stated that Harvard will come out fighting on Saturday.
“We set the goal to be undefeated in the conference,” Johnson said.  “We have a chance to do that, and we’re definitely not resting on our laurels. Hopefully we finish undefeated, because [being] 6-0-1 would be awesome.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There are 122 players on top-ranked Louisiana State University’s football roster. Sixty-five of them are African-American. Compared to the rest of the nation’s top teams, there is nothing remarkable about that number.
What is remarkable, however, is that in our not-so-distant past, African-American football players were barred from stepping foot on the field at all-white universities south of the Mason-Dixon Line, let alone attending and representing those same schools.
A lot has happened since then to change the way race is viewed in sports, and it has taken both time and hard work. But, as is always the case with such prolonged and significant processes, we look for individuals and specific moments to represent the work of many more unheralded heroes. We look for leaps to represent baby steps. Jesse Owens taking gold at the 1936 Berlin Olympics; Jackie Robinson breaking the color barrier in Major League Baseball; Michael Jordan becoming the most recognizable athlete in modern history. One such moment, and one such individual, in the progression of racial equality in intercollegiate athletics, came from an unexpected source: Harvard.
On October 11, 1947, Chester M. Pierce ’48 and the Crimson football team headed south to face the University of Virginia Cavaliers in Charlottesville, Virginia. UVA dominated the game from start to finish, sending Harvard back to Cambridge as recipients of a 47-0 drubbing.
Pierce, who then stood 6’4” and weighed 235 pounds, recalled in an interview with the Boston Globe in 1997 that “[he] remember[ed] nothing different in that game than any other game [he] played at Harvard.”
Even though Pierce claimed the game passed without incident, the racist sentiments of the time did have an effect on the trip. In Mark Bernstein’s 2001 book, “Football: The Ivy League Origins of an American Obsession,” Bernstein noted, “When a Charlottesville hotel manager insisted on lodging Pierce in a black hotel, Harlow moved the rest of the team there, as well. When a local restaurant owner made Pierce use the rear door, the entire Harvard team followed. When the Crimson entered the stadium on Saturday afternoon, Harlow ran in next to Pierce, staying on the side closest to the stands so that any debris thrown might hit him instead. Despite catcalls from the bleachers, the game passed without incident.”
Though it was the worst loss in then-coach Dick Harlow’s tenure with the Crimson, there was something else uncommon about Pierce’s performance that day. Pierce was the first African-American to play in a college football game south of the Mason-Dixon Line at an all-white university.
Harvard finished its season with a 4-5 record and has since headed south of the symbolic line just three times—all against William & Mary, and never since 1993.
After Commencement, Pierce went on to attend Harvard Medical School and is currently a professor emeritus of education and psychology at his alma mater. He founded and chaired Black Psychiatrists of America and was the President of the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurobiology. He even consulted with PBS on the creation of Sesame Street.
Though he is humble and dislikes the attention given to his participation on that cold October day over 60 years ago, claiming in a 1997 Boston Globe interview that “it was no big deal and took no courage by me,” Pierce has been a champion in the fight for racial equality.
In the Class of 1948’s 25th Anniversary Report, Pierce noted that “Most of my convictions revolve about the outrageous effects of racism.”
As is the case in most desegregated institutions, integration in sports did not negate racism. In the New York Times bestseller “Forty Million Dollar Slaves,” Bill Rhoden laments the progression of the black athlete as a “journey from literal plantations to figurative ones.” He points, somewhat convincingly, to the leadership structure in leagues, both professional and amateur: old, rich, white guys running the show, with young, black men putting on the show.
Inflammatory rhetoric aside, racism remains an issue in sports; regardless of which side of the Mason-Dixon you lie on.
Despite its longitudinal superiority, Boston is not without its own history of racism pervading into the athletic realm: The Red Sox were the last MLB team to field an African-American player, waiting until 1959, apparently as a direct result of then-owner Tom Yawkey’s desire; and the Celtics have long been considered the “white-team” of the NBA.
While Pierce claimed that “if there were racist things being said in the stands, I didn’t hear them,” he was not immune to racism while in Cambridge. A Crimson article from March 10, 1947 describes how Pierce and another African-American, Hallowell Bowser ’44, were denied entry into a local establishment, ‘Club 100,’ based on their skin color. Indeed, charges of racism have spread to the football field for the Crimson. In the 141 years since the first African-American graduated from Harvard, the Crimson has yet to start an African-American at the symbolically important quarterback position.
This, however, has more to do with personnel than institutional choice. Harvard has a long history of racial integration on the football field starting with the first African-American captain, William H. Lewis ’95 way back in 1893. The next African-American to captain an Ivy League football team was Levi Jackson of Yale, 57 years later.
Lewis was also the first ever black All-American, and was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2009.  He went on to become the first ever African-American US Assistant Attorney General in the Taft administration.
Lewis died just 14 months after Pierce took the field in Charlottesville. Pierce, who was the only African-American on his squad in the 40s, turned 84 earlier this year. And now, 64 years later most of us don’t think twice about the racial composition of the Crimson, or any other team in college football. Baby steps.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With only a couple of weeks left in its fall season before its week-long postseason, the Harvard co-ed sailing team clinched a spot in the Atlantic Coast Championship with an impressive showing at the 70th Professor Erwin Schell Trophy regatta, ensuring that next week will not be its last week of competition.
The Crimson co-eds took second place in the Erwin Schell Trophy, hosted by nearby MIT, finishing ahead of all other 17 schools aside from Ivy League rival Dartmouth.
Harvard also hosted the Victorian Urn intersectional on the Charles River, sending a contingent from the women’s squad that placed 14th out of 18 schools.
The Crimson got special treats, as alumni from the Harvard sailing team served as judges on the water for both regattas. In the Erwin Schell Trophy, former Crimson captain John Stokes ’11 heard protests and redress requests throughout the weekend, while in the Victorian Urn, Megan Watson ’09, also a former captain of the Harvard sailing team, took the waters to ensure that competition would sail smoothly.
70th PROFESSOR ERWIN SCHELL TROPHY
The Crimson may not have had to travel a long way to compete in the 70th Professor Erwin Schell Trophy, but the results of the regatta will go a long way in showing the success of this past season if the team can prove to be a strong competitor at this year’s Atlantic Coast Championship.
The tandem of Kopp and sophomore crew Sarah Pierson, a duo that has been successful all throughout the season, anchored the A-division for Harvard. Freshman Reid Bergsund also served as crew for Kopp, taking over Pierson’s duties for the fifth through 10th races of the regatta. The trio of sailors took second place in its division with 116 points, finishing in the top five spots in 11 of its 18 races. Its only miscue on the weekend came on a did not finish in the ninth race of the event.
The B-division boat sent out by the Crimson was just as strong as it’s A-division counterparts, as the duo of co-captain Alex Jumper and junior Emily Lambert took fourth place with 112 points. The two have been sailing together for over a year, and their comfort level with each other showed in grabbing 10 top-five finishes out of 18 on the weekend.
Harvard faced stiff competition from the rest of the crowd, but none more so than its rivals from the Ancient Eight.
The top four places in the regatta were all filled with Ivy League schools, with only 12 points separating first and fourth place. The Big Green sneaked by the Crimson’s balanced attack with a strong showing from its B-division team, ending the weekend only two points ahead of Harvard total of 228. Yale finished just two points behind Harvard, and Brown wrapped up the Ivy League domination with a score of 238 points.
THE VICTORIAN URN
With a weekend full of crazy breezes, the Crimson women’s squad hosted the Victorian Urn regatta on the Charles River.
While the more senior members of the sailing team earned a spot in the postseason, the Harvard women’s team—which took over the reigns for this regatta on its home waters—did not qualify for its Atlantic Coast Championship.
The A-division sophomore duo of Morgan Russom and Isabel Ruane finished in 14th place out of the field of 18 with a score of 149. The two had five top-ten finishes out of the 12 races on the weekend.
B-division racing was taken care of by sophomore Caitlin Watson and senior Caroline Lowe, their 154 points good for a 14th place finish matching their A-division counterparts.
Dartmouth took the top spot in the Victorian Urn as well, while the Crimson finished in 14th place overall, taking the tie-breaker over the U.S. Coast Guard Academy.
The Harvard sailing team has just one week left in its fall season before the ACC championships, and the squad is confident that it will be ready to compete with the rest of the top competition in the Northeast.

Looking to take a break from HUDS' dinner menu? On Nov. 3, there will be a veritable smorgasbord of free food at the First Annual Harvard Square Restaurant Expo which will take place in Ticknor Lounge from 8:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. The Harvard Culinary Society is hosting the event, which will feature restaurants such as Bolocco, Wagamama, Finale, b.good, Tommy Doyles, Dado Tea, Clover, and more. These restaurants will be giving away free samples, coupons, and menus to take.
"We just want to have another event that could get students aware of food around the square. It's nice to go out," said Rebecca A. Ruskin '13, president of the Harvard Culinary Society. The group hopes to also raise awareness for freshmen of local places to eat at, in case Annenberg is starting to grow old.

At the beginning of the school year, a few freshmen in Holworthy decided to bring a new sport to Harvard: spikeball. But what started as fun in the Yard quickly became a full-fledged, very popular club sport. This Saturday, Harvard hosted the first inter-collegiate spikeball match against Dartmouth giving the football game that came later in the day a run for its money.

Would you be more willing to trek across the river to see a sporting event if we told you that you could win an iPod nano and Beats headphones? You can this Friday at the Harvard-Princeton hockey game, as the Student Rewards Program is giving away this season's grand prize. The game, which starts at 7:00 p.m. at the Bright Hockey Center, will give away the prizes to one of three finalists who will be chosen for the raffle for the two items. Two of them will be picked from those who have accumulated a significant amount of Crimson Cash from attending multiple Student Reward games, and the third will be a wild card, chosen at random from the undergraduates who will attend Friday's game.
The giveaway comes from the Student Relations Committee of the UC, who were dismayed at the lack of attendance at sporting events, according to Daniel P. Bicknell '13, the chair of the committee.
"By going to a sporting event which might be an hour or two long, there's that opportunity cost of, well, maybe I should take a nap or go out to dinner, or just rest," Bicknell said. Harvard students are economical with their time, and the numbers just don't add up.
That is, until UC reps and Harvard Athletics instituted the Student Rewards Program at the beginning of this year to incentivize students to attend the events. Now if a student presents his or her Harvard ID to the ticket vendors at any Harvard sporting event, one dollar will be magically added to their Crimson Cash account. That is a quarter short of a laundry load, a soda at the vending machine, or one-third of a trip to Berryline.
The Men's hockey game against Princeton marks the end of the fall Student Rewards Program. But don't get discouraged; you too can have a chance at winning next season’s grand prize. The schedule for next season's rewards can be found on the Athletic Department website.
