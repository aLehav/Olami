After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The world of the Harvard Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production of the award-winning Broadway play “Proof”—which ran in the Loeb Experimental Theatre this weekend—is “horrible yet wonderful. Ugly yet beautiful. Dysfunctional yet functional. Warm yet cold. Put simply, real,” according to director Kriti Lodha ’12, who is also a Crimson magazine editor. “Proof” tells the story of Catherine (Caroline R. Giuliani ’11), the daughter of Robert (Robert Rogers, an HRDC alumnus who currently works in the Harvard Math department), a renowned mathematician, who struggles with caring for her genius but mentally ailing father while trying to take care of herself as well. With standout performances by Xanthia A. Tucker ’13, (as Catherine’s sister Claire) and Jesse T. Nee-Vogelman ’13 (as Robert’s former student Harold “Hal” Dobbs), “Proof” was an incredibly moving production.
Claire represents the stereotypical obnoxious sister. As the older sibling, she moves away to New York City, away from the chaos of her father’s illness. Yet when she returns after his death to take care of her sister, she attempts to take over the situation, of which she knows nothing about.
Tucker played this part stunningly; clad in smart business attire, she portrayed Claire as a well-meaning but ignorant sister. Her dialogue with Giuliani was always quick and snappy, both actresses demonstrating their skill with lines delivered clearly and with spunk. Specifically, in their first scene together, the sisters shared a particularly awkward hug that sums up their relationship for the audience and helps set the tone for the upcoming scenes.
Nee-Vogelman played the socially awkward 28-year-old Hal, a former student of Robert who is clearly in love with Catherine. Nee-Vogelman did a great job of playing both the math-geek trying to impress the daughter of his hero and the intellectual who, during the second half of the play, works tirelessly to validate a proof to save Catherine’s sanity.
During the last scene, Nee-Vogelman delivered a moving speech to Giuliani as she worried about becoming like her father. “Maybe you will be like your father,” he said, “or maybe you’ll be better.” For much of the play, Nee-Vogelman and Giuliani worked extremely closely with each other, and the sexual tension is palpable. However, when they finally did act upon their desire, it seemed that the previous awkwardness dissipated a little too soon, making the scene less meaningful than it could have been.
The most well represented relationship in this production was that between Catherine and Robert, which culminated in a flashback scene in the second half depicting Robert’s regression. Rogers’ exemplary depiction of his character’s degeneration into madness was particularly impressive since the scene took place outside in December, and Rogers shivered throughout the entire episode.
Guiliani was also noteworthy, as she movingly alternated from excitement about a possible mathematical breakthrough for her father at the beginning of the scene to the realization that this breakthrough was in fact only his mentally unstable ramblings. Giuliani’s performance of the caring and devoted daughter, especially during this scene, truly thrust the importance of a father-daughter relationship in this play to center stage. At the heart of “Proof “ is a story of love.
Being an extremely personal play, it seems fitting that Proof was held in the Loeb Ex, an extremely intimate venue; in particular, the use of the stairs in the midst of the audience, successfully drew viewers into the scene.
The setting was simple, consisting of an outdoor porch with two circular banisters on each side of the stage. However, these banisters seemed to hinder the performance more than they helped. Often times during a dialogue, one of the characters would lean on a banister and look at the audience as they spoke instead of at the character with whom they were talking. Often this device was distracting, and it seemed like the banister acted as a crutch for the actors to not have to look at each other at meaningful points in the dialogue, taking away from what could have been very emotionally charged moments.
Despite the confusion inherent in such topics as love, insanity, and math, “Proof” clearly demonstrates the ability to endure regardless.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As I stood silently five feet away, I watched a man strangle a pregnant woman and then place her carefully in a cradle. Thankfully, those involved in the attack were actors, but this reality does not make the violence any less unnerving.
The scene—Macbeth’s murder of Lady Macduff—is one of many haunting situations found in “Sleep No More,” the surreal theatrical experience presented at the Old Lincoln School in Brookline by British theater company Punchdrunk and the American Repertory Theater (A.R.T.) through Jan. 3. More than a simple show, “Sleep No More” is an enthralling multi-sensory experience, an opportunity to step into the liminal space between theater and reality and enter the terrifying, mysterious world of “Macbeth”-gone-Hitchcock.
The dozens of rooms in the Old Lincoln School have been scrupulously converted into the world of the play, complete with a 1930s-style bar and a live band that starts the show. The light is dim and the music loud—the better to suggest that one has just walked right through the screen into a Hitchcock thriller. Audience members—or, more accurately, participants—are given white full-face masks as they are called out of the bar area, and then separated from their groups into various areas of the transformed school.
What happens next is different for every person who enters this shadowy world. The audience becomes the play’s ghosts, haunting the characters as they move about the building and commit acts of violence, lust, and revenge. Participants are free to roam the various floors of the school, following cast members as they encounter them, or examining the meticulously crafted décor in each room.
There is a story being told—the tragedy of the Scottish king—but its linearity is irrelevant to the overall experience. What co-directors Felix Barrett and Maxine Doyle achieve is far more compelling; they manage to evoke a mood, to create an atmosphere. As I wandered the basement—the stomping ground of the witches—I was genuinely afraid and anxious that one of these weird sisters might appear. Suddenly, the threat of Shakespeare’s witches and their sinister magic became real.
While the playwright casts a shadow over the entire production, not a word of Shakespeare’s text is ever spoken. Instead, the performers communicate stunningly through movement. A choreographed fight-dance between Macbeth (Geir Hytten) and Lady Macbeth (Sarah Dowling) was as evocative and passionate a scene as I’ve witnessed between an on-stage couple. While some scenarios leave more to be desired—the slow-motion banquet scene grows dull after a few minutes, and fails to express the awesome terror of Banquo’s ghost—the beauty is that the audience can simply just leave the room and go explore somewhere else. A genuine feat of both direction and choreography, “Sleep No More” needs no words to articulate its purpose.
What makes “Sleep No More” truly remarkable, however, is the degree to which it heightens the audience members’ senses, making them aware of every element surrounding them. Sight and sound nearly always play a role in theater, but here smell becomes crucial—the rotting dinner in the Macduffs’ dining room, the crisp trees of Birnam Wood, the wood-chip floor in the basement speakeasy. Touch also plays its part—you can rummage through desks or pick up a letter Macbeth wrote to his wife. These new sensations create a world, one that is in turn mystifying and unsettling.
Every experience in this dreamlike world is unique, and each audience member becomes the co-author of his or her own performance. In this way, “Sleep No More” isn’t an effortless show to see or understand, and an individual simply cannot see it all in one night (although the events loop twice in the course of an evening). However, this is more than worth the challenge it presents to its audience. After the masks come off, the ghosts of “Sleep No More” will continue to haunt you, changing the way you look at theater.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“When freedom lights the beacon in a man’s heart, gods are powerless against him,” Zeus says in Jean-Paul Sartre’s play “The Flies.” Through the Electra myth, Sartre’s work skillfully explores notions of free will and human essence. This mélange of existentialism and Greek mythology would have been unremarkable to the 20th century audience for whom the play was written. But redefined within the contours of the 21st century—as the Harvard Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production which opened this Friday demonstrates—“The Flies” becomes incredibly more complex.
There is no doubt that Sartre’s original adaptation of the Greek mythology is brilliant. The play tells the story of Orestes and his sister. After an affair between their mother Clytemnestra and her lover Aegisthus results in the death of their father Agamemnon, the siblings avenge him by killing the responsible couple, who had taken over the kingdom of Argos, imposing their guilt upon the people in the form of perpetual mourning and black clothing. Sartre cleverly ties this in with existentialism. The guilt does not belong to the people but they are forced to express it. By mourning, the people no longer conceive the world through their own minds but through those of others. Through allegory, Sartre criticizes the people of his epoch trapped by religion and social norms. “Eyes so intent on me, they forget to look into themselves,” Zeus says. Such people cannot light the beacon within themselves.
Successfully adapting this chef d’oeuvre for the 21st century is one of greatest challenges for Geordie F. Broadwater ’04, the director, and his collaborators. Most obviously, they modified the dialogue, adding humor and irony to the first three quarters of the play. Teenage jargon—“dude,” “you’re so hot”—was inserted into some lighthearted scenes. Though the play can be funny, at times the alternating philosophy and humor becomes too obvious; the audience knows that a joke is coming, and naturally the joke isn’t funny anymore. Notably the scene where the three Furies parodied contemporary teenage anguish was over-the-top and far too long. To make matters worse, it seemed to have no real point. Despite the occasional slip, however, the dialogue flows considerably well and sounds convincingly contemporary.
Visually, “The Flies” plays it safe under the direction of M. Amelia Muller ’11. No sets and props are impressive or revolutionary, but their symmetry, harmonious colors, and moderate lighting render them all pleasant. The shadow silhouettes on the background wall are effectively executed; the visual factors of the play remain fairly quiet as well, never detracting from the action on stage, save for one moment. In an unfortunate set decision, the barricade blocking the entrance of the cave to hell goes flying, awkwardly disrupting the rhythm of the show.  But unlike the soundtrack of “The Flies,” it was a forgivable error.
The music accompanying the play was poorly handled. Near the end of the play, the odd inspirational music during Zeus’ soliloquy on free people almost entirely drowns him out. Kurt Cobain’s musical appearance was another lamentable moment. The 90s rock star’s voice was distracting, not to mention, incongruous to the play’s mood. One was reminded that more casual doesn’t mean more modern.
“The Flies” does have redeeming qualities, though. As a result of Muller’s careful direction, the Furies jump around the stage in perfect, spastic coordination; two of Aegisthus’ men blind one another in a flashlight duel resembling that of a good Rosencrantz and Guildenstern staging.
In the end, “The Flies”—which will play until Oct. 24—is worth the two hours and a half. The existentialist questions that it poses are poignant, and the production functions well enough to successfully deliver them.

Over the past few decades, medical improvements have made parenthood possible for millions of couples suffering from infertility. One of the main technological breakthroughs is in-vitro fertilization, which unites the sperm and egg in a test tube before implanting the embryo in the mother’s womb. The technology, however, comes at a high price. The procedure itself is expensive, but, more importantly, it can greatly increase the chance of seeing birth complications.
These complications are mainly caused by the implantation of multiple embryos at once, a technique used to increase the rate of success of the procedure—but one that also increases the chance of twins, triplets, or even octuplets. This in turn leads to premature births that need intensive neonatal medical attention. Given this, we believe that fertility clinics and physicians have a moral obligation to avoid implanting multiple embryos.
Caring for the premature births of IVF newborns is also estimated to cost the U.S. healthcare system $1 billion each year.  Additionally, premature babies are put at a higher risk of suffering from developmental problems such as mental illnesses, learning disabilities, and hearing impairments. These children often require increased health care for the rest of their lives.
Both fertility clinics and government health officials are aware of the dangers of multiple embryo implantations. The risks, however, are lost on parents who are desperate to start a family and ignored by physicians who want to keep their success rates high. Parents tend to want to implant multiple embryos in order to increase the chance of pregnancy and avoid paying a second time for the procedure.
Given these perverse incentives, it is extremely important that parents are made aware of the risks they may be running and the possible dangers they are exposing their future child to. Doctors have a responsibility to discuss and explain these issues while recommending that parents seriously consider alternative solutions that do not involve implanting multiple embryos.
A child’s right to be born healthy should trump a parent’s desire to ensure that a child is born. Parents and doctors need to acknowledge this right, especially when different solutions, such as adoption, may be reached.
In the end, however, this debate brings up complicated questions concerning the ownership of one’s body that are difficult to address. For this reason, we believe that parents should be legally allowed to pursue multiple embryo IVF, but that doctors should strongly advise against it. We encourage thoughtful consideration of these questions given the complexities of the issue. For now, we hope that fertility clinics will work more concertedly to decrease the number of multiple embryo implantations.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I never thought, as a 10-year-old, that when my mother took my sister and me to church every Sunday so we could “make an informed decision” about our own religious views when we were “old enough to choose,” I would someday be glad she did. At that age, church was simply an obstacle to playing video games and doing what I wanted to all weekend long, and I still remember the fights we had, come Sunday morning, about whether we really had to go.
Since then, however, I’ve learned to appreciate her insistence on giving us a religious education. Even now, I see the relevance of what I learned in church school in my studies and my attitude toward the world.
Believer or not, it’s impossible to deny the effect that religious ideas have had on the world, in fields ranging from art to literature to philosophy. Experiencing some of those ideas firsthand, whatever tradition they stem from, is certainly an asset for anyone who seeks to become an educated person. One might argue that taking a class on religion achieves the same effect as actually practicing that religion—and, certainly, studying religion from a comparative perspective and learning about the views of various groups is an extremely valuable pursuit. But there is also something to be said for experiencing religion oneself, not from the perspective of an outsider looking in, but as a member of a religious community.
For one thing, the practice of most religions is a communal experience. Whether it involves singing, chanting, or just reading religious literature with others, most people’s experience of religion involves not only solitary study but also spiritual experience in a group setting. Trying to understand a religion without experiencing its mode of worship is like reading about the rules of baseball in a book without ever attending a game and being a spectator yourself—you might get a basic idea of how the players move around the field, but you probably won’t understand why watching the game has so much appeal.
While it would be impractical to suggest that everyone should get a full experience of every religion in the world, to experience even one religion in depth by studying its teachings, attending meetings or services, and being a part of a religious community can provide insight into spiritual beliefs in a way that learning about them from the outside cannot.
Of course, many religions have long histories of intolerance toward other viewpoints, and there is always a danger that, in promoting the practice of religion, one is breeding intolerance.  However, religion also has a great potential for fostering tolerance: When religious groups teach their members to be open to others’ beliefs, the experience of belonging to one religion can help people draw parallels to their own experiences and create understanding deepened by shared beliefs and experiences.
Indeed, such understanding is of critical importance today. Although much ink has been spilled about today’s “secular age,” religion remains extremely relevant. The large majority of people are still spiritual in some way—only four percent of Americans define themselves as atheist or agnostic. However, the number of people unaffiliated with any faith, especially among young Americans, is growing. This trend poses the danger of creating a new generation that will grow up outside of any sort of religious tradition altogether, making it harder for them to come to their own “informed decisions” about their own beliefs.
In order to give the next generation an opportunity to experience religion, parents should be encouraged to give their children a religious education—not to indoctrinate them and make them intolerant of others’ viewpoints, but rather to give them the experience of being part of a spiritual community as well as to teach them about religion through the actual practice of it. Only in that way will they be able to truly understand the beliefs of those around them.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Universities took special notice when, in his inaugural address, President Obama called on all citizens to commit to a cause greater than themselves. The president observed that the price of freedom is “a recognition, on the part of every American, that we have duties to ourselves, our nation, and the world; duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly.”
Americans of my generation heeded a similar call to service from President John F. Kennedy ’40. When I graduated from college in 1968, I spent two years working in the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development as a representative to local communities in Philadelphia. Forty years later, I am reminded of this brief immersion in federal service as I have the opportunity to welcome HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan ’87 to campus on Thursday as part of Public Service Week.
By shining a spotlight on public service this week, we hope to reinforce Harvard’s commitment to serve the common good, and we wish to recognize the many contributions made by our students, faculty, and staff every day—through teaching, research, hands-on service, and developing policy solutions. There is a wide range of issues and projects in which members of the Harvard community are engaged as well as opportunities for service you may wish to pursue.
Recent data show that young people, in numbers not seen since the 1960s, are participating in public service. According to a 2008 Harvard Institute of Politics survey, more than half of 18- to 24-year-olds say they are interested in engaging in public service. Likewise, on our own campus, the majority of undergraduates report participation in public or community service during their time here.  This past March, Phillips Brooks House Association’s alternative spring break program, which sends students to various locations for weeklong public service activities, received a record 380 applications—an increase of approximately 90 percent from last year. Harvard seniors from the Class of 2009 also set a record for applications to Teach for America—223 students applied, more than in any other year since the organization’s inception.
This information suggests that young people increasingly see public service as an important part of their identities and as a central component of citizenship. At the same time, they are actively expanding the definition of what it means to serve. Public service work ranges from teaching to military service, from addressing poverty issues to generating government solutions to shared problems. It means working for a foundation like Gates or Rockefeller or serving in the Peace Corps. It means founding a nonprofit, like Project HEALTH, started by Rebecca Onie ’97 as an undergraduate and continuing today as a model of effectiveness in helping low-income patients overcome socioeconomic barriers to health care, or the Harlem Children’s Zone, established by Geoffrey Canada, whom we will honor this week with the Robert Coles “Call of Service” award. This organization has transformed the lives of thousands of children in New York through after-school activities, mentoring, and family support.
As an educational institution, Harvard is committed to expanding the frontiers of knowledge and to supporting our students and faculty in developing their deepest interests, talents, and ambitions. For students and alumni interested in public service, we have an obligation to recognize the many forms that such service may take over a lifetime and a duty to assist in identifying pathways to service.
To that end, Dean Evelynn M. Hammonds and I last year formed a university-wide administrative committee charged with recommending ways in which we can enhance the support we give to undergraduates who wish to pursue public service opportunities while at Harvard or upon graduation. I look forward to receiving and acting on recommendations of the committee during the course of this academic year.
If you are one of the majority of undergraduates interested in public service, it may become the focus of your career; it may be a stepping stone as you build a career in another field; or it may be a dimension of a multifaceted life. Whatever path you take, and for however long, you are choosing to do something of great importance: to give your talent, time, and energy to something larger than yourself.
In observing Public Service Week now, we honor a commitment made by Harvard through the ages. One hundred and forty years ago today, Charles W. Eliot was installed as the 21st president of Harvard. It was his fervent belief that the university must, as he put it, “foster the sense of public duty—that great virtue which makes republics possible.”
I hope that together we can accept the invitation of presidents, current and past, to dedicate our collective energy as a university community to the solution of the world’s critical problems and to the pursuit of the common good.
Drew G. Faust is the president of Harvard University.

I really didn’t want to write another column about Antonin Scalia, but sometimes the crazy fruit is so low-hanging that you can’t help but pick it. Witness Justice Scalia during oral arguments in the latest case involving a religious monument on government property.
The dispute revolves around a big, white cross that was placed on federal land in the Mojave Desert as a memorial to the American World War I dead. A lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union reminded the court that there are ways of honoring all American soldiers, not just the Christians. Incredulous, Scalia responded, “The cross is the most common symbol of the resting place of the dead.” The ACLU lawyer, whose father and grandfather were Jewish war veterans, retorted that he has never seen a cross in Jewish cemeteries. Getting frustrated, Scalia replied, “I don’t think you can leap from that to the conclusion that the only war dead that that cross honors are the Christian war dead.”
Why do so many defenders of government-sponsored religious messages resort to arguing that the symbols of their faith are either secular or meaningless? Scalia is a devout Roman Catholic; he has said that a judge should quit his job if it requires him to violate his religious morality. But he is so committed to upholding the right of the Christian majority to use government property as if it were church grounds that he willfully denies the significance of his faith’s most important symbol (well, maybe second to the Jesus fish).
But enough about Scalia—at least for two weeks. I shouldn’t get too worked up about governmental cross-and-creche displays, even though they seem clearly unconstitutional. Over the last 50 years, we have rebuilt the most important sections of the wall between church and state: We’ve eliminated prayer from public schools, protected the teaching of evolution, and removed blatantly sectarian displays from the classroom and the courthouse. I don’t think we need to abolish “In God We Trust” from our currency—or take down every cross in the desert—in order for secularists to claim victory in the battle for the public square.
Instead, we should turn our attention to reforming Americans’ prejudices. In particular, bias against atheists sometimes causes tangible disadvantages, not just symbolic slights. For instance, judges in child-custody hearings sometimes discriminate against non-religious parents, unconstitutionally punishing their lack of faith. Such cases are surprisingly common: UCLA law professor Eugene Volokh documented 25 instances between 2000 and 2005, and that includes only the cases that reached appeals courts. In many other cases, we can be sure, judges take religion into account but do not say so in their rulings. A legal victory can get rid of explicit discrimination; it will take more than that to address the sort that hides away in hearts and minds.
Unfortunately, the notion that non-religious people are somehow unfit is not limited to child-custody hearings. Even as the number of Americans claiming no religion has risen to historic highs (12 percent, according to Gallup), polls show that a majority of Americans would not even consider voting for atheist candidates for president. Nor, apparently, for other offices: Congressman Pete Stark (D-CA) is the only admitted atheist holding national office. It may seem superficial, but these things matter. Imagine if we snapped our fingers and every item on NOW’s and the NAACP’s agendas were suddenly realized, except that there remained only 17 female senators and one black one. Wouldn’t you still say that progress requires improvement in those numbers?
Of course, there are probably many closeted nonbelievers serving in Congress, but that only proves the point: In many parts of the United States, disbelief is a social handicap that one is better off keeping secret. Those who criticize strident atheists like Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens never stop to think that they’d be strident too if they knew that half of all Americans hold unfavorable views of their group—more than for any other minority.
But are Dawkins and Hitchens the best weapons we have in the battle against anti-atheist discrimination? They seem unlikely to convince many fence-sitters, but that’s not their only goal. Their calls to arms might empower nonbelievers to reveal and express themselves, and thus to normalize atheism among the general public. Perhaps, then, the next generation of Supreme Court justices won’t be unable to imagine how a cross might seem exclusive. We’ll know we’ve made real progress when American Apparel starts to make “Legalize Atheist” T-shirts.

Harvard’s decision to use derivative investments to lock in low interest rates on the school’s mounting debt cost the University $500 million this past year and will cost it at least $425 million more over the next few decades, according to the University’s annual financial report released Friday.
Harvard entered into interest rate swap agreements—which are used to hedge against rising interest rates—in 2004, when it seemed that interest rates had reached favorable lows and that locking in those rates would help the University finance its mammoth, long-term expansion into Allston. But the agreements backfired this past year when the global financial crisis pushed interest rates to unprecedented lows, thereby decimating the value of the swaps.
Harvard, looking to safeguard its cash supply from the increasing threat of losses associated with the swaps, decided to post $500 million in collateral this past year to terminate agreements on $1.1 billion of its debt. In addition, the University will pay another $425 million over the next 30 to 40 years for new “offsetting” interest rate swaps, which will essentially negate the effect of the original swaps on $764 million of its debt.
“A precipitous drop in interest rates and liquidity considerations made it important for us to scale back the swaps substantially,” said University Treasurer James F. Rothenberg ’68 in a interview posted by Harvard. “That has come at a real cost, but at least we are now in a better risk position going forward.”
After the terminations, Harvard now has $3.1 billion of debt subject to interest rate swap agreements.
Many other universities have similar interest rate swap agreements in effect, but not to the magnitude of Harvard’s arrangements. Rothenberg said that this was because Allston presented Harvard with a “unique opportunity” to aggressively expand.
CASH CRUNCH
Friday’s report, which follows Harvard’s announcement last month that its endowment had shrunk by 30 percent this past year, also reveals billions of dollars in losses sustained through the University’s investments of cash designated for short-term expenses.
Harvard has traditionally pooled cash from the University’s various schools in a General Operating Account that is invested alongside the endowment—a practice that the report said “generated significant positive investment results” in the past. But this year, that strategy backfired, dragging the value of the GOA down from $6.6 billion last year to $3.7 billion this year. Part of that decline reflects the payments made to terminate interest rate swap agreements.
Harvard’s investment strategy, which has long emphasized broad diversification of assets, has also made the portfolio more illiquid, or difficult to convert back into cash. This has proved especially problematic amid the broadly slumping markets of the past year.
According to the report, the GOA is used to manage and execute all University financial transactions, including routine bill payments.
This weekend, the Boston Globe’s article on Harvard’s financial report suggested that the University’s decision to invest short-term cash alongside higher-risk endowment assets was unusual, and cited Stanford spokeswoman Lisa Lapin as saying that her school “wouldn’t take a cash account and invest it with the endowment.”
But in an interview with The Crimson, Lapin said that her comments may have been misinterpreted and emphasized that she was saying that her school’s operations are funded by investments held alongside the endowment. Stanford’s 2008 financial report, the most recent one available, states that the California university uses an “Expendable Funds Pool” partially to fund operations, of which a “substantial portion [is] cross-invested” in the Merged Pool, which consists of the endowment and other long-term funds.
Dan Shore, Harvard’s CFO, also told The Globe that the GOA losses did not prevent the school from meeting its existing obligations, and that the University’s cash position was secured by new debt issued by the school this year. Nevertheless, Shore said in an interview posted by Harvard that the school has adjusted its investment strategies to emphasize short-term flexibility and cash needs and will continue pursuing such “rebalancing efforts” in the future.

Hundreds of thousands of spectators gathered along the river bank this weekend to watch the 45th annual Head of the Charles Regatta—which featured a record 8,800 athletes and 210 international teams this year—but rainy weather led to decreased fan attendance yesterday.
Approximately 121,000 spectators attended the event on Saturday, while 84,000 came yesterday, according to estimates by the Massachusetts State Police. Head of the Charles Spokesman Jim Connelly said the event normally attracts about 120,000 fans on Saturday and 170,000 on Sunday. But he added that the decrease in turnout this year was not completely unexpected, due to the weather.
Except for a few concerns about the wind, Connelly said, the weather did not affect the races themselves.
“It’s a water sport, so rowers are used to getting wet,” he said.
But for the vendors who set up tents beside the races, the rain had a detrimental effect.
Representatives from Chipotle Mexican Grill and Boloco said their tents— which feature interactive activities— saw increased visitor traffic on Saturday, but they failed to maintain that level of traffic on Sunday. Boloco, which had two tents, decided to close one tent earlier than originally planned.
Henry Herrera, of Herrera’s Mexican Grill, said that, in the ten years his restaurant has participated in the Regatta, his tent experienced the slowest traffic this year. Part of the reason, he said, was that the “bad weather forecast” kept some tourists away, but he also cited increased competition as another explanation.
According to Connelly, the number of vendors increased this year because of event administrators’ efforts to court more businesses, including smaller chains.
Caitlin C. Leibert, the New England marketing manager for Chipotle, said that the chain decided to set up a tent for the first time this weekend because “the regatta is a classic Boston event and represents a great opportunity to meet our customers.”
In spite of the rain, fans who attended the event said they were still able to enjoy themselves.
John McConnell, a Boston resident, said the regatta was an “incredible spectacle,” with “a pageant of vendors” that featured a variety of goods and services.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Much like this month’s Faculty meeting, the first “all-hands” meeting of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences last Friday went without cookies and coffee.
“We cannot go back to serving coffee to the entire world and things like that,” said new Dean Cherry A. Murray. “I would rather put that money into hiring world-class faculty.”
In front of a full lecture hall of faculty, staff, and students, Murray explained the financial status of SEAS and her plans to expand the faculty and strengthen the school’s community and curriculum.
Murray, who arrived at SEAS only a few months ago, began the meeting by saying, “My door is open, please come talk to me.”
Showing graphs of the SEAS budget and endowment, Murray said that the school was in “reasonably good financial shape but not flush,” thanks in large part to the work of her predecessor Venkatesh “Venky” Narayanamurti, who sat listening in the audience.
Currently, SEAS predicts a 5 percent drop in its endowment each year for the next few years, but Murray said she does not “anticipate” any staff layoffs in the coming year.
In an effort to foster camaraderie among the different areas of SEAS, Murray is requesting proposals for community building activities—for example, an Ultimate Frisbee game between the applied math and electrical engineering students.
She also said she hopes to have each subject area within SEAS contribute to enhancing the school-wide curriculum, adding that she plans to maintain SEAS as a small, interdisciplinary school without departments.
“We need to make sure as we grow we don’t turn into stone pipes,” Murray said.
At the end of the meeting, Murray took questions from the audience, as well as from a list compiled from anonymous online submissions.
Several of the audience members asked about a new collaboration with Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering, a small school in Needham, Mass., known for its innovative undergraduate curriculum.
Murray responded that she hoped to integrate some of Olin’s ideas into the SEAS curriculum, particularly incorporating design elements into engineering classes.
“I would like to get the design in the curriculum from freshman year,” Murray said. “It’s so important for engineering and so exciting to learn that way.”
When she came to an anonymous question asking for more financial and accounting assistants, Murray asked, “That was you, Harry, wasn’t it?” causing Associate Dean of Finances Harry E. Dumay to smile and shake his head amid laughter.
After responding to a final comment about her new community building activities, Murray added, “If you want lavish cookies, you can propose that in the community building plan—but it has to be between areas.”

Quincy House celebrated its half-century history on Saturday night at an anniversary event attended by inter-generational House affiliates whose connections with the House span the past five decades.
Quincy House—commonly referred to as the “People’s House” because of its cutting-edge architecture and spirit of inclusivity—reminisced about its birth during the 1950s with swing dancing and an “old school” sherry hour, according to House Master Deborah J. Gehrke.
Soft Touch, a 17-piece band that includes recently retired Harvard Divinity School Professor and Quincy Senior Common Room affiliate Harvey G. Cox Jr., serenaded guests with jazz and swing tunes.
“The band had some soothing music, and it set the mood well,” said Quincy resident Christopher A. Ballesteros ’12.
Guests’ attire helped recall an earlier era of Quincy’s history. Dressed in a style particular to the 1950s, men in attendance wore jackets, and women were clad in dresses, dancing in the dimly-lit dining hall.
Residents said that the anniversary provided “a rallying point” that has extended beyond the one-time event, bolstering the current House spirit that manifests itself in ways ranging from participation in intramural sports to Stein Club attendance.
“It’s been especially beneficial for the sophomores coming in—essential in cementing House pride,” Quincy House Committee co-Chair Erin C. Yu ’10 said.
House activities have included 50th-anniversary overtones throughout the semester, according to HoCo member Jakub Dolecki ’11. The House’s sweatshirts reference the half-century anniversary, for example, and HoCo members said they were expecting increased sales because of the reference.
The Quincy House Masters had been planning the event since January. But because of increasing budget cuts over the course of last semester, budget considerations impacted the event in a “pretty major way,” Gehrke said, adding that the Masters had to limit the number of alumni invitations to the event due to fiscal constraints.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hoi Q. Nguyen ’10 was expecting a low-key shift while working one day in the Dunster House library a year ago.
As he sat at the desk near the entrance, with a view of the entirety of the library in front of him, he heard the sound of a knob turning from behind—an odd occurrence, because the library doors are usually propped open.
Caught off guard, Nguyen turned around to find the bookshelves opening up and a person nonchalantly walking into the library from behind its walls.
“I can imagine people going in there and doing shady business,” said Nguyen, who added that many undergraduates—including some Dunster residents themselves—don’t know about the swinging shelves.
From library walls opening up to unsuspecting residents to hidden rooms concealed behind seemingly unusable doors, such eccentric architectural features of the College’s neo-Georgian Houses are a surprising, but unique, aspect of the undergraduate experience. From their construction in the early 1930s to today, the stoic charm of these buildings has come to embody Harvard’s identity, both among its student body and to the outside world.
“I think in the case of the Harvard buildings, it was just an enduring sense of spatial wonder that led some patron to put a little extra charm in the houses,” said Harvard Graduate School of Design Professor K. Michael Hays.
But with House renewal—the estimated $1 billion project to physically reconstruct and modernize the College’s 12 upperclassman Houses—slated to begin in three years, undergraduates, tutors, and House Masters all voiced concerns over whether the initiative will leave intact the neo-Georgian Houses’ architectural oddities, which they say have contributed to the character of the Houses over the last eight decades.
CLANDESTINE PARTY SPACES
Residents who stumble upon elusive passageways and rooms in the neo-Georgian Houses—which include Adams, Cabot, Dunster, Eliot, Kirkland, Leverett (McKinlock), Lowell, Quincy (Old), and Winthrop Houses—often become the gatekeepers of these hidden spaces.
When Adams resident Toomas Laarits ’10 moved into C-57 last year, he and his roommates settled into what they thought would be a triple. A week into the school year, a senior whom Laarits had never met asked him for access to some “storage space” in his bedroom.
To his surprise, the senior opened a metal door in Laarits’ room that Laarits had previously overlooked, which led to a concealed bedroom. The triple in Adams C-57 was actually a quad.
After clearing out golf clubs and other vestiges of residents past, Laarits and his roommates decided to furnish the space, installing a chandelier in order to transform the dusty room—which prior residents of C-57 had used for storage—into a weekend party spot.
“Sometimes when we had parties there, people would come up to me the next day and say, ‘Did we go into a wall last night?’” Laarits said. “And then I’d say to them, ‘No—don’t know what you’re talking about.’”
While Adams residents have used the distinctive features of their rooms for personal use, some Kirklanders have incorporated their spaces into House-wide traditions.
Kirkland B-51 resident Michelle E. Seslar ’11 said her room hosts a “time-honored” Kirkland event, which she wasn’t “at liberty to expand upon,” as a result of a unique architectural configuration that allows the room to expand into a neighboring entryway.
In addition to the connecting entryway, the dwellers of B-51 have made use of a secret stairwell—which is otherwise concealed behind an activated fire door—to conveniently gain access to another Kirkland room.
The women of B-51 have established a quirky protocol for entering the adjoining suite, which is inhabited by several Kirkland men.
“The rule is, you’re supposed to knock, yell [the resident’s] name, and wait for a response,” said B-51 resident Basima A. Tewfik ’11. She added that when she once failed to follow this specific sequence, she had to provide candy corn to make up for the infraction.
A SIGN OF THE TIMES
Harvard’s Houses have become a hallmark of the nearly four centuries-old institution, despite the fact that they were only constructed relatively recently, in the first half of the 20th century.
The neo-Georgian style, which derives its name from the first four British monarchs of the House of Hanover (Georges I-IV), takes its inspiration from the highly symmetrical and ordered style of Georgian architecture in 18th- and 19th-century England.
Neo-Georgian architecture in the early 1900s eschewed features of modern architecture such as steel and cement, favoring instead the stately red brick and sash windows that were more characteristic of an earlier time.
But seemingly inexplicable secret rooms and hidden doorways may have once served a contemporary purpose for residents of Harvard College.
In 1932, when Adams House completed its conversion into an upperclassman house, Americans were still struggling against the constraints of more than a decade of Prohibition. Hidden rooms, including the one in Adams C-57, could have functioned as a hideout for producing and consuming moonshine liquor, as was a common practice in buildings across the country at the time.
Secret staircases, such as the one in Kirkland B-51, could have served as service stairs. Unlike the public stairs in plain view in several Houses, servants most likely traversed those staircases hidden from sight as they waited on their wealthy undergraduate patrons.
But, according to Hays, architectural quirks like moving bookshelves and tucked-away rooms were probably built more for aesthetic than practical reasons.
“Who wouldn’t want a secret room or secret passage?” he said. “My guess is that these features in the Harvard houses are for pure pleasure—more elaborate versions of reading alcoves and window seats that were also enjoyed.”
According to Hays, the priorities of architects who designed and constructed neo-Georgian buildings in the first half of the 20th century were markedly different from those of architects today.
“In past times, architects and their patrons expected their buildings to have more mystery and wit than we do today,” Hays said.
AN ENHANCED VISION
The College’s nine neo-Georgian houses have withstood decades of wear and tear since they were constructed between 1910 and 1930, making them prime candidates for extensive reconstruction.
They have since been named historical landmarks by the City of Cambridge and, according to the Office of Student Life, will maintain their historic facades, even though their interiors are expected to be completely revamped.
The Report on Harvard House Renewal, released by the College administration in April 2009, stressed the need to upgrade the Houses for 21st-century living, while still maintaining their unique “Harvard aura.”
But with the loss of the physical space within Harvard’s historical walls comes not just the potential loss of quirky architectural features, but also the loss of stories of past inhabitants that are inextricably tied to House spirit.
In a very public example of Eliot House pride in the 1950s, then Eliot House Master John Finley reportedly bragged to the New York Times, “Where else would you find, in one room, the grandson of Matisse, the grandson of Joyce, and the great-great-great-great-grandson of God?” Finley was referring to Eliot A-12, whose former residents include Paul Matisse, the grandson of French impressionist Henri Matisse, Stephen Joyce, grandson of novelist James Joyce, and Sadruddin Aga Khan, a descendant of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.
“[Internal renovations] will inevitably affect House spirit negatively,” said current Eliot House Master Lino Pertile. “The distinctive nature of various Houses has to do with the design of the House—the feel of it. The more you flatten out this distinctiveness, the more [the Houses] become the same, and so the more difficult it is to have House spirit.”
Some argue that the proposed changes to the Houses necessarily stray far from the initial neo-Georgian conception of House life in the 1930s.
At the time, aristocratic white men— who donned black coats and ties and enjoyed the services of in-House servants—lived in the Houses. Today, women and students of diverse ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds comprise Harvard’s undergraduate population.
The under-utilized squash courts and empty in-House pools of many Houses may be replaced by modern amenities. The Pfoho House Committee has proposed including a bowling alley, which is also supported by House Master Nicholas A. Christakis.
Still, as the process of House renewal moves forward, Jonathan Levi, an architecture professor at the GSD, emphasized the importance of having a forward-looking approach to redesigning the College’s unique residences—just as the original architects had nearly eight decades ago.
“My hope is that the administration and students will take into account the future—the needs of the future, and how the University of the future needs to express itself,” Levi said. “The past is only so beautiful as it is because people at the time were emboldened to think what the future meant for them, and we have to take on that charge ourselves.”
“It takes leadership to look beyond the myopia of the past,” he added.

This year, Yale released tailgate rules for this year’s Harvard-Yale Game that, while largely unchanged from two years ago, are markedly more lax than the controversial ones issued by Harvard last year.
According to the guidelines on the Yale University Athletics Web site, each Harvard House and Yale Residential College will be allowed one oversized vehicle to be parked in a designated student tailgate parking lot. Permits for oversized vehicles without House affiliation will also be available for purchase on a first-come, first-serve basis.
Yale has also banned drinking games and “drinking paraphernalia,” but the rules allow tailgates to continue until the third quarter and do not prohibit kegs.
In 2008, rules set by Harvard and the Boston police forced tailgates to end at kickoff and prohibited kegs. Last year’s rules disquieted Yalies and some Harvard students who criticized them for being too stern, The Crimson reported at the time.
Since the Nov. 21 Game will be at New Haven, the situation is incomparable to that in Boston and Cambridge, said Yale Senior Associate Athletics Director Ryan G. Bamford.
“Yale has different challenges than Harvard. We have a different atmosphere, a residential neighborhood,” he said. “The goal is to create a safe and enjoyable atmosphere for all of our fans.”
House Committees are already planning for the Game’s tailgate.
Mather HoCo, in cooperation with Currier House, plans to rent a U-Haul truck for the tailgate and operate a shuttle service from Harvard to Yale, according to Mather HoCo Social Chair Ankur N. Agrawal ’11, who said that the rules at Yale offer greater options for tailgate programming. Agrawal is also a Crimson Design editor.
“It’s going to give us flexibility, more choices as to what kind alcohol we can bring,” he said.
Representatives from Lowell HoCo and Leverett HoCo said that their Houses have not begun planning for the event.

Russian police have arrested a criminal group responsible for the trafficking of counterfeit college diplomas, including those from Harvard, according to a statement released by the state-run news outlet Russian Information Agency Novosti.
The criminals—whose activities were uncovered by officials in the Russian Interior Ministry’s Economic Security Department in July—have been charged with issuing spurious Harvard diplomas for $40,000 each, according to the news release.
The figure is a significant discount from the near-$200,000 price tag of a four-year undergraduate education at Harvard. University spokesman Kevin Galvin declined to comment on the situation.
“I think it’s a compliment in a way,” said Ruo S. Chen ’12. “It makes me feel good that people are willing to pay that much money to get a diploma from the school that I go to.”
But Harvard was not the only elite institution to fall victim to the forgery. According to the RIA release, fake diplomas for the Plekhanov Russian Academy of Economics—a prestigious Moscow-based public research university—have also been discovered, selling at a rate of 300,000 rubles, or $10,000.
The criminals used bank cards to conduct international transactions, according to the RIA report.
Far from being a problem exclusive to Russia, diploma forgery is a crime of international scope—thousands of fake documents are annually discovered in countries like Britain, the United States, and Ukraine, according to Alexei Shyshko, deputy head of the Department.
“A large group of fraudsters are involved in the business, and much time is required to discover them,” said Alexander Khazin, deputy chief of the investigative department in the Interior Ministry, in the report.
Given the extent of the criminal operation, Shyshko said diploma forgery had implications that “society in general”—and not simply the police—had to combat. For examples, employers will have to verify the authenticity of their employees’ diplomas, he noted.
Specific qualities would hamper easy reproduction of Harvard diplomas for forgers, according to Marilyn Danz, associate registrar of records and requirements in the Registrar’s Office.
“You could spot a fake a mile away,” she said in a 2002 interview with The Crimson about diploma forgery. Danz could not be reached for comment Saturday.
The requirement of the signatures of five school officials and the raise embossed seal on Harvard diplomas make them particularly tricky to replicate, she said at the time.
But as indicated by the news of the fraud—which was publicly announced by the Interior Ministry of Russia’s Economic Security Department on Thursday—the Russian criminals seem to have found a loophole.
“It is annoying to some extent because people are getting [diplomas] without going through the Harvard experience,” said Ross P. Ford ’12. “But, at the same time, it’s kind of shocking and funny because it’s not what you would immediately expect from a Russian gang.”

Researchers at Harvard and the University of California, San Diego have discovered that a small region of the brain that has been predominantly associated with language production, is also responsible for language comprehension—blurring the lines on what has been a fundamental concept in psychology.
The findings debunk the long-standing assumption that Broca’s area—which is commonly linked to language production—serves a completely distinct purpose from Wernicke’s area—the region responsible for language comprehension.
“We have long suspected that this classical model of language was too simple,” said Psychology Professor Steven Pinker, who co-authored the study with Nedim T. Sahin, a post-doctoral fellow in the UCSD radiology department and in the Harvard psychology department.
For their study, researchers focused on three epilepsy patients undergoing the rare procedure Intra-Cranial Electrophysiology, in which electrodes are implanted into the brain to gauge which regions are responsible for causing epileptic seizures.
“It was kind of an accidental experiment,” Pinker said. “We were fortunate that neurosurgeons implant electrodes in the brains of patients with epilepsy.”
During this study—the first to use ICE to study how the brain interprets grammatical rules and produces word—researchers had the patients read a series of words and then reproduce them in different grammatical forms: for example, the inversion of a noun into a plural, or the conversion of a verb into the past tense.
Researchers found that three different linguistic computations—lexical (recognizing the word), phonetic (articulating the word), and grammatical (converting the word to a plural or past tense)—all occurred within small regions of Broca’s area. Brain activity indicating the computations occurred at roughly 200, 320, and 450 milliseconds after the word was presented to the patient.
The discovery that the computations occurred sequentially, all within about half a second of each other, refuted the idea that Broca’s region is only involved in language production.
“This might be a final nail on the coffin of the old model,” Sahin said.
Since different parts of language computation occur in different parts of the brain, the researchers plan to further investigate whether there is synchrony, or simultaneous electrical activity, in both Wernicke’s and Broca’s regions.

Harvard President Drew G. Faust announced on Friday a new public service initiative to support The Greater Boston Food Bank—the largest hunger-relief organization in New England and one of the largest in the country.
According to Amy Cooper-Ayles, director of volunteers at GBFB, groups of 20 volunteers at a time—consisting of students, faculty, and staff—will fill shifts at the Food Bank roughly once a week beginning in January and continuing until the end of the academic year. Two shifts in November will also be filled by members of the Office of the President and the Provost and the Office of Government, Community and Public Affairs.
The Food Bank does not serve meals, but rather distributes more than 30 million pounds of food and grocery products each year to soup kitchens, homeless shelters, and other community organizations. Cooper-Ayles said that volunteers help sort through the food for damaged, expired, or seasonal products.
She added that Harvard’s commitment is unique, and that in her three years at the Food Bank, no other university has offered a similar long-term pledge of service. Harvard’s commitment, she said, will help ensure that there are enough hands to sort through food after the holiday season, when the number of volunteers typically drops off but the amount of product to be sorted is greatest.
Christine M. Heenan, Harvard’s vice president for government, community, and public affairs, said that volunteer groups from the University’s schools will be solicited by liaisons working for the President’s public service committee, as well as by contacts at the Phillips Brooks House Association and the Graduate Student Council. She said the cost of the commitment was “minimal”—roughly $7,000 for this academic year—and will stem from transportation to the Food Bank and lunches for volunteers.
Harvard’s commitment to the Food Bank comes just before the University launches its Public Service Week, which begins today and recognizes and promotes public service activities and careers. According to the University’s press release, roughly 7,000 Harvard students contributed more than 900,000 hours of service in and around Boston in 2005-2006.
“We’re thinking in terms of our greater power as a community rather than as individual schools or units,” Heenan said. “[This commitment] is something that might be much harder for one school or unit to do for the entire academic year, but together, it is a commitment we can sustain for the entire year.”

James W. Gilchrist, founder of the Minuteman Project, was uninvited from a speaking engagement Saturday at the Harvard Undergraduate Legal Committee’s annual Public Interest and Law Conference, sparking debate over the limits of free speech.
Slated to speak as part of a panel on immigration, Gilchrist spent the past five months communicating with the conference organizers and raising funds from Minuteman supporters to finance his trip to Cambridge.
“Right before I’m supposed to board my plane for Boston, I get an e-mail from the sponsors saying that we have a problem,” he said, citing the “threat of a disturbance” as the reason given for his exclusion. He was given the news of the invitation’s withdrawal five days before he was scheduled to speak.
The movement to ban Gilchrist from the conference was largely initiated by Kyle A. de Beausset ’11, who in early October began using different university mailing lists to build support for uninviting Gilchrist due to his involvement in the Minuteman Project, which organizes civilians to patrol the border for illegal immigrants and to report crossings to the Border Patrol.
“It might be an interesting intellectual exercise for Harvard students to hear extremist views,” de Beausset wrote in one of these e-mails, but he added that the “broader implications of legitimizing these extremist views with the Harvard name” were more important.
“Jim Gilchrist’s willingness to spout falsehoods shows that he shouldn’t be given the legitimacy of open and free academic debate...His irresponsible rhetoric has led to violence,” de Beausset told The Crimson in an interview.
In a statement released on the conference Web site, the Undergraduate Legal Committee said that Gilchrist’s presence would detract from the conference because his attitude and views were inconsistent with the conference’s mission of promoting law and public service to foster social justice.
“Unfortunately, Mr. Gilchrist’s participation in the conference on the behalf of the Minuteman Project was not compatible with providing an environment for civil, educational, and productive discourse on immigration, and we cannot host him at this time,” it said.
The Undergraduate Legal Committee declined requests to provide further comment.
Heated discussion ensued over some campus e-mail lists. Students on the Black Men’s Forum e-mail list debated what constituted—in de Beausset’s words—“free speech and hate speech...responsible dialogue and irresponsible rhetoric.”
National news media outlets, including The Boston Globe, have reported on Gilchrist’s exclusion from the conference, and both Gilchrist and de Beausset have appeared on Fox News to discuss the situation.
Gilchrist is not unaccustomed to controversy. In 2006, a speech he was delivering at Columbia University came to a halt after students in the audience stormed the stage with banners and knocking over tables and chairs in protest.

As an unusually early first snow fell on Harvard grounds yesterday afternoon, activist William E. McKibben ’82 spoke to an audience of over 150 people in Memorial Church, requesting their help in drawing attention to the drastic effects of climate change.
“Climate change is no longer a future threat,” McKibben said. “It is a very present crisis breaking over our heads this moment, by far the greatest crisis  our species has seen yet.”
At the event, which was co-sponsored by Harvard and several statewide religious and environmental organizations, McKibben called upon audience members to participate in International Climate Day on Oct. 24, when communities across the world will publicly demonstrate their support for the “350” movement. The 350 movement aims to influence policy-makers to adopt a global standard of 350 parts per million carbon at the United Nations Climate Change Conference to be held this December in Copenhagen. This is the level necessary to avoid catastrophic warming according to NASA climate experts, McKibben said.
“The political method has failed badly,” said McKibben. “Virtually nothing has been done to grapple with the scale of this problem or to take measures of the kind we need to take.”
On International Climate Day, the advertising screens in Times Square will broadcast real-time images from demonstrations from around the world. On that day, people will be gathering to form a massive number 3 in Israel, a 5 in the West Bank, and a 0 in Jordan at the point where their three borders meet.
McKibben encouraged audience members to partake in one of Boston’s International Climate Day demonstrations, including the 350 Under Water Festival held at the Aquarium T-Stop. It will resemble a similar event in which the president of the Maldives held an underwater cabinet meeting to sign a climate change resolution.
At yesterday’s convocation, Jewish, Christian, and Muslim religious leaders said their holy texts called on believers to be “stewards of the earth.”
“It was encouraging to see so many different faiths represented here and delivering the same message,” said David Lanskov, who runs the global warming web page at the First Parish Unitarian Universalist Church in Arlington.
Director of the Harvard Office for Sustainability Heather A. Henriksen’s told the audience, “We need everyone in every field making dramatic changes so we can achieve 350.”

The Undergraduate Council voted last night to create a formal UC-House Committee liaison program, as part of the UC’s renewed efforts this year to become more responsive to student concerns.
The legislation sets an expectation that all upperclassmen UC members will regularly attend their House HoCo meetings.
“Somehow the UC has lost touch with the student body,” said legislation co-sponsor Felix M. Zhang ’11 during last night’s meeting. “Upperclassmen identify with their House...so as the UC, we should be liaisoning with HoCos.”
“Often times HoCo chairs care a lot about the campus community, but are not really interested in the UC,” said Student Relations Committee Chair Daniel V. Kroop ’10. “This is a way to make sure people who do have opinions about the campus are being reached out to.”
Kroop said that formalized communication with HoCos, including questionnaires or surveys, will help the UC obtain more “quantitative measures” of student opinion.
“[For example,] we might ask about hot breakfast...for eggs, would you be willing to give up some desserts?” he said. “These things are hard to for us to get a sense of.”
According to Kroop, the UC is also interested in better understanding how the $140,000 allocated to HoCos every year is spent, and if and how it might be spent more effectively.
In addition to the HoCo liaisons, freshmen representatives will be expected to table biweekly in Annenberg to better reach out to their constituencies.
LATE SHIFT
The UC also officially shifted the times of freshman Brain Break in Annenberg to open and close half an hour later, changing it from a 8:45 p.m. - 10:15 p.m. schedule to 9:15 p.m. - 10:45 p.m. The modified times were based on the same change proposed and implemented last year by former UC representative Benjamin M. Zagorsky ’12, who reported to the UC at the time that the earlier half of Brain Break was poorly attended by freshmen.
According to South Yard representative Crystal D. Trejo ’13, the early brain break hours were a widespread concern among freshmen this year, and many students had expressed satisfaction with the change.
“We hope the volume of students who actually attend Brain Break will increase,” said North Yard representative Winston S. Waters II ’13. “This is a really great thing for the freshman class.”
The UC also voted in support of developing an official alumni organization for the UC.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In sports, commentators often react to blowouts by saying, “That game was over before it began.”
The expression, of course, asserts an impossibility, but in the Harvard football team’s 35-18 loss to Lafayette on Saturday, it was practically true.
An opportunistic and persistent Leopard offense combined with an ineffective and mistake-prone Crimson attack to put Lafayette (5-1, 1-0 Patriot) up, 28-3, by halftime. Harvard (3-2, 2-0 Ivy) played better in the second half, outscoring the Leopards, 15-7, but by that point, it was too little, too late.
“Well, bottom line is that Lafayette did a better job playing and coaching than we did today, and that’s why they got the victory,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said. “I think...the combination of a very good Lafayette team and certainly a less-than-great effort—not effort, but less-than-great production on our part—[led to the loss].”
Harvard’s woes began on the first play of its first possession, after the Crimson defense forced a Leopards punt. Junior quarterback Collier Winters hit junior wideout Chris Lorditch over the middle, but Lorditch coughed up the ball on the Harvard 27 for a fumble, and Lafayette recovered.
The Leopards wasted no time in taking advantage of the favorable field position, calling on senior tailback DeAndre’ Morrow to carry the ball.
Morrow—normally Lafayette’s fourth-string running back—broke out on his first carry for 21 yards, and then rumbled into the endzone on a six-yard run to put the Leopards up, 7-0.
Morrow finished the game with 88 rushing yards on 11 carries and also caught four passes for 54 yards. The Hilton Head, S.C. native hasn’t seen much playing time in his college career, but he’s taken advantage of his rare opportunities on the field, especially against Harvard. In 2007, Morrow made his first career start in a game against the Crimson and racked up 225 all-purpose yards.
“When we got out there, we just wanted to do something immediately,” Morrow said. “And we know how we play when we have a spark from the beginning. So coming out there, I felt comfortable running the ball, and simply that, we did what we had to do.”
With less than five minutes remaining in the first quarter, Harvard commited another costly turnover. Winters fired a rocket to senior wide receiver Matt Luft, but Luft couldn’t handle the pass, and the ball deflected into the hands of Lafayette linebacker Michael Schmidlein.
With the ball on the Harvard 47, the Leopards once again capitalized on a Crimson miscue. Lafayette worked the ball down to the 23, and—once again—Morrow got the call.
The senior responded, breaking through the Harvard defense and finding the open field. Morrow sauntered into the endzone for a 23-yard touchdown rush to put the Leopards up by 14.
“We have to take advantage of all the turnovers, and that’s what we do—we execute,” Morrow said.
Harvard had a chance to cut the deficit in half early in the second quarter, after having moved into the red zone at the end of the first on the strength of a 33-yard pass from Winters to Lorditch and solid running by junior tailback Gino Gordon. But the Crimson was stifled after Winters was sacked on the Lafayette 12, and Harvard had to settle for a field goal.
Down 14-3, the Crimson would not score again for the rest of the half. But the same can not be said for the Leopards, who dominated the second quarter, executing a balanced offensive attack spearheaded by senior quarterback Rob Curley. Lafayette found the endzone twice more before the clock ran out, heading into the break with a 28-3 lead.
Fortunately for Harvard, the second half was a less lopsided affair than the first.
The third quarter saw the Crimson and the Leopards engaged in a defensive battle, with the two teams trading three-and-outs.
“We hunkered down in the second half—we did a little better job,” Harvard captain Carl Ehrlich said. “But at the same time, it shouldn’t take letting up 28 points in the first half to do that.”
In the fourth, the Crimson offense finally began to show signs of life.
Taking the ball on his own 13-yard line with under 11 minutes left in the frame, Winters marched his team down the field, completing four of his six passes for 48 yards and scrambling effectively, while rookie tailback Treavor Scales provided the run support. The drive culminated with 6:05 left in the game when Winters connected with junior wideout Marco Ianuzzi on a 14-yard touchdown pass.
“I thought Collier played well today, we just didn’t give him enough help,” Murphy said. “He hung in there; he really competed; he made some good throws; he made some good scrambles.”
Lafayette responded with a touchdown of its own to go up 35-10, giving Harvard one more chance to bring the score within the realm of respectability.
Facing a fourth-and-23 at the Lafayette 47, Winters threw up a desperation heave to the endzone. Improbably, the ball fell into the waiting hands of Lorditch. The Crimson converted the two-point conversion to cap off a memorable scoring effort in an otherwise forgettable game.
“I think the biggest takeaway from this is that there’s plenty to improve,” Ehrlich said. “There’s plenty to fix before we go down the Ivy League stretch.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With eight consecutive losses to Harvard, the Lafayette football team didn’t need much extra motivation for Saturday’s game.
But the Leopards got it in the form of freshman Peter Bross.
Bross, a fullback from Allentown, Penn., was diagnosed with cancer just before his high school graduation. The rookie had been doing well in his first weeks on campus until a setback on Friday required hospitalization.
“We just were inspired by Peter,” senior tailback DeAndre’ Morrow said. “He’s been going through a lot and battling a lot, and just seeing his tenacity is something that inspired us. So we wanted to come out and make a statement for him.”
On Saturday, Lafayette reversed its losing trend against the Crimson—a team it hadn’t beaten since 1996.
The win also completed the Leopards’ four-game sweep of their Ivy opponents, as the team had already taken down Penn, Yale, and Columbia this fall.
“Our seniors wanted this year to be different than a year ago,” Lafayette coach Frank Tavani said. “The last three years, we’ve gotten to 4-1, we’d gotten to this point, but we couldn’t get to that 5-1...We came out and played a heck of a game.”
But the Leopards did it with Bross in the forefront of their minds.
“Our players dedicated their effort to him today,” Tavani said. “We dedicated today’s game ball to Peter Bross.”
RUN DOWN
Just a week after junior Gino Gordon and freshman Treavor Scales lit up the Cornell defense with a combined 229 yards and three touchdowns, the Harvard rushing game was nearly silent against Lafayette.
Scales led the team with 40 yards on 10 carries, while Gordon mustered just 26 yards on 11 touches.
The Leopards boast the Patriot League’s best defense, allowing just 14.6 points per game heading into Saturday’s contest. And that dominance did not falter against the Crimson offense.
“When you don’t establish the run, it makes everything more challenging,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “It’s a struggle to get any continuity. And you still want to keep running the football to get a little bit of balance in your offense, but at the same time, it’s easier to defend the pass if you’re not running the ball very well.”
While the Crimson had to rely on junior quarterback Collier Winters’ 233 passing yards for most of its offense, Lafayette mastered the balanced attack.
The Leopards’ senior quarterback Rob Curley threw for 210 yards and two touchdowns, while Morrow led the rush with 85 yards and two touchdowns. Lafayette’s ball carriers gained 133 yards on the ground.
THREE AND OUT
Most of Harvard’s dismal offensive performance in the first half had to do with its inability to get drives going.
Though early turnovers were costly for the Crimson, as the Leopards turned a fumble and an interception into its first two scores, Harvard hurt itself just as much with its struggle to get first downs.
The Crimson mustered just five first downs in the first half, and midway through the third quarter, the team had as many penalties—six—as first downs.
“It’s a team game, it’s a game of real estate,” Murphy said. “And one of the things we’ve done an effective job with the first four games is staying on the field offensively…But today, our third-down conversions were really, really poor, and our defense was out there much too long.”
Harvard was just 2-of-16 on third-down conversions for the game, while Lafayette was 4-of-12.
The Crimson was able to pull things together in the fourth quarter, with two touchdown drives and nine first downs, compared to just three first downs for the Leopards.
But the hole Harvard had dug itself in proved to be insurmountable.
“As I said even in our victories, we’re not a dominant team,” Murphy said. “We have to do everything right because everybody’s good enough to beat you if you don’t do all the little things.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After Harvard football’s narrow win over Brown in Week 2—a game in which the Crimson racked up 11 penalties—Harvard coached Tim Murphy said that “penalties in general is a concern, and it will be addressed.”
“If you look at us traditionally, we’re team that doesn’t beat itself,” Murphy continued.
But when the Crimson took on Lafayette this Saturday at Harvard Stadium, the Leopards owe some thanks to the way Harvard beat itself throughout the first half.
A combination of the Crimson’s inability to get first downs, the recurrence of flags thrown against Harvard, and offensive turnovers led to 28 first-half points for Lafayette. Shortly before the close of the third frame, the Crimson had just six first downs and already six penalties.
“Penalties are inexcusable,” Murphy said after Saturday’s 35-18 loss. “When we win, we win by minimizing mistakes. We gave it to them.”
Harvard got off to an auspicious start—on the very first snap, the Leopard’s Carlos Lowe disrupted a pass complete to junior Chris Lorditch, and Eric McGovern recovered the fumble.
Lafayette started its drive just outside the Crimson’s red-zone territory, and it took just two quick runs from DeAndre’ Morrow to put the Leopards on the board.
Lafayette extended its lead later in the frame after a Michael Schmidlein interception started another drive in Harvard territory. Morrow again decimated the Crimson line, scoring a touchdown on a run from 23 yards out.
“We didn’t have any continuity on offense in the first half,” Murphy said. “We put our defense on too-short fields and put them out on the field too much.”
“We didn’t really make them earn them,” Murphy continued. “If you look at the plays that we turned the ball over, they weren’t spectacular plays, we just didn’t get it done.”
The Leopards capitalized again on Harvard miscues to start the second quarter.
Senior Conor Murphy kept a Lafayette drive going when he got flagged for “running into the kicker”—a penalty that gives the kicking team five yards, which was enough to give the Leopards a first down in this instance.
Lafayette nearly shot themselves in the foot with a costly 10-yard holding call in Crimson territory, but a hard hit dealt from junior Collin Zych to the Leopards’ Mitchell Bennett was flagged for “illegal helmet contact,” and what was going to be a 3rd-and-20 situation suddenly morphed into second and four.
Lafayette’s fourth touchdown drive of the first half was kept alive when a pass from Leopard quarterback Rob Curley to Mark Layton fell incomplete, but pass interference was called against Harvard senior cornerback Derrick Barker—a penalty that results in an automatic first down.
“Defensively, we make no excuses,” captain Carl Ehrlich said. “We’ve got to make the stops.”
Fortunately for the Crimson, the way the Ivy League is structured rendered Saturday’s loss meaningless in the greater scheme of things. As Harvard drops to 1-2 against non-conference, Patriot League opponents, it still enjoys a 2-0 record against the Ancient Eight.
With the Crimson’s upcoming slew of Ivy matchups—especially Princeton next week, who despite being 0-2 kept things even with Brown on Saturday through the first half of play—Harvard has to cut down on the mental mistakes.
“We have to do everything right because everybody’s good enough to beat you if you don’t do all the little things,” Murphy said.
And if the Crimson can remain lossless going into the penultimate weekend—no easy task with a matchup against a suddenly energized Columbia squad in Week 8—Harvard will have to face a team that could also be undefeated, Penn.
We’ve cleared the midway hump of the season, and if the Crimson has any aspirations of pulling a three-peat Ivy title, it needs to fully address the penalties and blunders that have threatened to undermine that championship run.
So far nothing consequential has resulted yet from these missteps, but with only Ivy opponents left on the schedule, Harvard cannot let its guard down.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After giving up four goals to UConn on Wednesday night, sophomore goalkeeper Austin Harms and the rest of the Harvard men’s soccer team’s defense wanted a shot at redemption.
Luckily for them, they didn’t have to wait long, as the chance to make amends arrived ten minutes into the second half of Saturday afternoon’s key Ivy League game against No. 15 Brown (7-1-4, 2-1 Ivy). Moments after co-captain Andre Akpan had broken the deadlock and given the Crimson a 1-0 lead, sophomore defender Baba Omosegbon was sent off, leaving his team with ten men for the final 35 minutes. But Harms and his defense handled everything that was thrown at them, and the No. 6 Crimson (9-2-1, 2-0-1) came away with a huge 1-0 victory over the Ivy League-leading Bears on Ohiri Field.
Harms summed up the importance of the match simply: “This game was our Ivy League season,” he said.
“I turned around, and I knew the defense wasn’t going to give up a goal,” Akpan said. “We were going to do whatever it took.”
The previous week had not been kind to Harvard. After opening the season by winning eight of its first nine matches, the Crimson sputtered to a 1-1 draw with Cornell, an early setback in its quest for the Ivy League title. The midweek trip to Connecticut followed. The 4-0 loss to the Huskies marked the first game this season that Harvard had allowed more than one goal. In a matchup that was billed as a battle between two of the nation’s top defenses, the lopsided scoreline served as an embarrassing reminder that most of the Crimson’s six shutouts had come against weaker opposition.
“A loss like that is humbling,” Harms said.
Desperately seeking to get their season back on track, the Harvard players did not need any extra motivation going into Saturday’s game against an undefeated Brown team. But a fierce rivalry has developed between the two teams that annually compete for the league title, and the mutual distaste could almost be felt in the cold autumn air.
Chances were few and far between in the first 45 minutes, with both teams getting good opportunities to open the scoring. Brown nearly took the lead in the sixth minute, but Harms did well, diving full stretch to his right to stop Sean Rosa’s strike.
In the 25th minute, senior midfielder Adam Rousmaniere played a perfect ball off a free kick to the back post, where it was met by the head of senior Kwaku Nyamekye. The ball came across goal, just missing Akpan’s foot.
With five minutes remaining in the period, freshman striker Brian Rogers slipped through the Bears’ back line and just beat the Brown keeper—junior Paul Grandstrand—to the ball. But Rogers did not make the connection he would have wanted, and a Bears defender was on hand to sweep away the danger.
But just three minutes into the second half, the Crimson had its lead. Rogers picked up the ball on the left and cut into the middle before playing it through to Akpan in the middle of the box. Fourteen yards out with his back to goal, Akpan turned his defender and fired a quick shot with his left foot that beat Grandstrand. Upon scoring, Akpan ran to his bench to share the moment with his teammates.
But the joy soon turned to dejection, as Omosegbon was sent off in the 56th minute for a foul on Grandstrand. Omosegbon, trying to dribble the ball into the box, took a heavy touch that ran through to Grandstrand. Perhaps frustrated with his poor touch, the sophomore defender decided not to pull out of a tackle on Grandstrand—and paid the penalty for it.
The red card may have been harsh on Harvard, but the Crimson players could not afford to feel sorry for themselves.
The Bears immediately put the Crimson on the back foot and with 25 minutes to go were making Harvard’s 1-0 lead appear very tenuous. But the Crimson back line was up to the task. In a three-minute span, Harms saved twice in one-on-one situations.
“That’s just the job of the goalkeeper, that’s what you do—make those big saves when it matters,” Harms said. “My defense came up big, and when they needed help, I was there.”
While Omosegbon’s red card may have put Brown in control of the game, it also raised the volume of the 600 fans in attendance—many of whom were Harvard soccer alumni.
“These are all our best friends,” Akpan said of the many graduates at the match. “It’s motivation—you want to do well for them.”
Whether it was the presence of their former teammates or just the knowledge of the importance of the game that drove the Crimson players, they were able to hold on and claim a 1-0 victory that not only turns their season, but also the conference standings.
“That was a big character one,” Harvard coach Jamie Clark said. “You had your special players, [Akpan] and Rogers, becoming workers and showing that they’re willing to do it…that was big for me—for the stars to put in the blue collar work.”
The Crimson effort was exemplified by junior midfielder Alex Chi, whose work rate was a known commodity before the match.
“[Chi’s] engine is unbelievable,” Clark said. “I think he’s everyone’s favorite payer. He plays the way you would love every player always to play.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Playing in the midst of fierce winds at Ohiri Field on a cold Saturday morning, the Harvard women’s soccer team needed more than the standard 90 minutes of play to come away with its fifth-straight win and remain undefeated in Ivy League play, as the Crimson (6-5-1, 3-0 Ivy) defeated Brown (4-7, 1-3) in overtime, 1-0.
After failing to score off its first five corner kicks in regulation, Harvard capitalized on its sixth attempt as junior forward Katherine Sheeleigh put away the golden goal in the 93rd minute.
Just over two and a half minutes into the first overtime, freshman forward Caroline Albanese took the ball down the sideline and played it off her defender to earn her team a corner kick from the left side of the field. Sophomore midfielder Melanie Baskind took the kick for the Crimson, placing it just in front of the goal for Sheeleigh, who knocked the ball to the ground before hammering it home.
“It was just a big jumble mumble of us all in the center, and then we just managed to get something on it,” said Sheeleigh, who scored her sixth goal of the year, matching her output from last season. “We all were just crashing the net and it got in.”
Sheeleigh has led Harvard in its recent winning streak, accumulating four goals in her team’s past three matches.
“She’s consistent,” Crimson coach Ray Leone said. “Whether she’s scoring or not scoring, she does whatever it takes to help the team.”
Though it took an extra session for either team to net a score, both teams had earlier chances to end the match. Less than a minute before Sheeleigh’s shot sent Brown back to Providence, the Bears had a strong opportunity to come away with the victory.
In the second minute of overtime, Brown forward Marybeth Lesbirel fired a shot that was deflected off the crossbar by Harvard senior goalkeeper Lauren Mann before she recovered it.The post aided the Crimson defense in the second half as well. In the 70th minute, Brown’s Gina Walker headed the ball over Mann, but the shot hit the crossbar. Mellissa Kim recovered the ball for the Bears and appeared to have an open shot on goal, but freshman defender Taryn Kurcz swooped in to block the attempt just in time.
“It was a rough day for us, and that’s why I’m so proud of our team,” Leone said. “We were able to withstand an incredible performance by Brown and just hang in there.”
Harvard was not without its own scoring opportunities in regulation. Just over two minutes after the Brown header deflected off the post in the second period, Baskind led a Crimson counter-attack and found senior forward Christina Hagner just feet in front of the net. Hagner, who led Harvard in scoring last season, booted the ball at Bears keeper Steffi Yellin, but the ball was knocked away.
After going scoreless in regulation—something the Crimson has already done three times this season—Harvard came through in the extra session.
“I think today’s game was just a game of heart,” said Sheeleigh, who left the game in the 26th minute with an injury to her hand but returned just over two minutes later with her fingers taped. “It was just really like a gruesome battle the whole way through, and we just kept fighting, and that’s why we got the win.”
The Crimson offense, which entered the contest averaging 1.55 goals per game, was slowed by the strong wind that it fought against both in the first half and in overtime.
While the Bears also struggled with weather conditions when the teams switched sides for the second half, their offense still managed to come away with a solid scoring opportunity.
“I thought we had a really strong second half against the wind,” Brown coach Phil Pincine said. “We even had some chances, which we didn’t think we were going to [get], since Harvard didn’t get many in the first half against the wind.”
The Harvard defense, led by Mann and sophomore defender Lindsey Kowal, managed to neutralize the Bears’ attack. Mann finished the game with two saves, earning her fourth clean sheet of the season. Captain Lizzy Nichols, who returned to the lineup last Saturday after missing the team’s match against Fairfield, spent time at midfield instead of in her typical role as defender.
“Our back line is doing great, [and] we didn’t want to mix that up at all,” Nichols said. “They’re playing really well, so I just stepped into the midfield for a bit today.”
With the win, the Crimson remains undefeated in Ivy League play and keeps its position atop the conference standings before heading into a midweek matchup against Yale on Tuesday.
“We’re feeling a lot more comfortable the way that we are [playing], and we’re attacking a lot better,” Nichols said. “I think that it was about finding the right combination of players and just sort of finding that mentality that we need to win, and I think that the Ivy League [schedule] definitely brought it out of us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Crimson spread itself out over four different regattas, battling a variety of conditions and coming away with solid results.
Both the co-eds and the women sailed in some of their most competitive races of the season, placing eighth and seventh at the Navy Fall Intersectional and the Yale Women’s Intersectional, respectively.
Meanwhile, the co-ed team sent squads to the Captain Hurst Bowl—where Harvard didn’t fare as well, mustering only a 17th-place finish in limited racing—and the local-level Tufts Invite, where the Crimson finished sixth.
“It’s exciting to show the depth in the team, that we’re able to travel to four different regattas in one weekend,” women’s captain Liz Powers said. “We’re excited to keep improving.”
YALE WOMEN’S INTERSECTIONAL
Bolstered by an outstanding performance in the B division, the Harvard women placed seventh in a field of 20 in New Haven, Conn. Skipper Powers and sophomore crew Marie Appel placed second in their grouping, notching seven top-five finishes in 10 races.
“We were really excited about our boat finish because it was one of the more competitive regattas of the season,” Powers said. “Marie and I had never sailed together until this season, and we’ve been really progressing quickly as a team, getting used to each other’s style and improving our boat handling.”
In the A division, sophomore skipper Emily Lambert and classmate and crew Alexandra Jumper weren’t quite as successful, placing 14th with three top-10 finishes.
“[There were] very tough conditions this weekend, because it was freezing, and today the sleet made the racing pretty challenging,” Powers said. “The wind shifts direction very often, so a lot of this weekend was working on focusing on predicting how the wind would shift.”
Powerhouse Yale won the regatta on its home waters, followed closely by Boston College.
NAVY FALL INTERSECTIONAL
The co-eds sent their top contingent down to Annapolis, Md. this weekend to compete at the Navy Fall Intersectional.
In a very competitive regatta, featuring 20 of the nation’s top teams and an expanded slate of four divisions of racing, Harvard held its own, placing eighth overall.
“It went pretty well,” junior captain Alan Palmer said. “It’s a weird regatta because there were four divisions—usually there’s just two…it shows we have some depth.”
Junior Teddy Himler, sailing in the singlehanded C division, posted the Crimson’s best result of the weekend, coming in fifth in his division.
But Himler and his teammates had to contend with rough conditions in the Maryland waters.
“It was pretty brutal—it was really cold, it was raining…it was pretty windy,” Palmer said. “But coming from the Northeast, that’s our strength.”
Palmer skippered the A division boat, sailing with junior crew Grace Charles on Saturday and senior crew Michelle Konstadt on Sunday.
Sophomore skipper Brendan Kopp was joined by crews Konstadt, freshman Ryan Byrne, and sophomore William White, who is also a Crimson newswriter, throughout the course of the weekend in the B division, while rookie skipper Jason Michas sailed singlehandedly for Harvard in the D division.
In one of the only intersectional regattas the Crimson will sail this fall, Harvard felt that it held its own against out-of-division competition while gaining valuable experience for the rest of the season. Each boat was able to complete 20 races on the weekend. Roger Williams won the regatta by more than 60 points.
CAPTAIN HURST BOWL
While the co-eds in Maryland got plenty of opportunities to hone their skills on the water, the Crimson contingent in Hanover, N.H. suffered from a lack of races in the Captain Hurst Bowl.
“The thing is, to constitute a regatta, you have to have three races in each division,” junior skipper Colin Santangelo said. “The difficult part of the regatta just really was that there was so little wind, so every time there was the smallest bit of wind where we could sail, [we did].”
Only four races were sailed in each division, and Harvard struggled in limited competition, placing 17th in a field of 20.
Santangelo and freshman crew Sarah McCuskee placed 17th in the A division, while the rookie pair of skipper Sam Millham and crew Alma Lafler rebounded from a tough Saturday to place 16th in the B division.
“The first day, B division waited for five hours, and then finally sailed one race that probably shouldn’t have been held,” Santangelo said. “The wind really died at the end, and there was one major uncalled-for wind shift that just threw everyone for a loop. Flip a coin, and if you chose the right side of the course, you won the race, and if you chose the left, you got dead last.”
But despite the conditions, the Crimson still came away from the regatta with some positive developments.
“It was a really fun weekend—we spent a lot of time hanging out with the other teams, building campfires and stuff,” Santangelo said. “It was a regatta that usually you get 10 or 12 races and you can figure out the shifts and work on your consistency and boat speed. This was a regatta…where a lot of [the races] were just luck of the draw.”
TUFTS INVITE
In a regatta in Medford, Mass., a quartet of Harvard sailors logged valuable time on the water against a field of 12 local teams, finishing sixth overall.
The freshman pair of skipper Nick Waldo and crew Lauren Tiedemann placed eighth in the A division, while a tandem of seniors, skipper Alex Bick and crew Ali Beyer, was third in the B division.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For those who don’t know it, golf is a leisure sport of rolling greens and polo shirts. But those familiar with the game know the kind of tension and pressure it entails.
Just ask sophomore Connor Wentzell. With Harvard and Penn tied 2-2 on Saturday, the entire fate of the match rested on his performance.
The Crimson, a six seed, had already defeated third-seeded Dartmouth and was looking for a crack at the finals against Yale. Tied after 18 holes of play, Wentzell faced off against Penn’s Bryant Williams in extra holes. After Williams birdied the second extra hole, Wentzell and the rest of the Harvard squad were relegated to the consolation match against Columbia—which was eventually rained out—at the Ivy Match Play tournament at Bay Club in Mattapoisett, Mass.
“I didn’t lose it, but the other kid won it,” Wentzell said. “I did everything I could, I didn’t make mistakes, he just played a little bit better on the last hole.”
While Wentzell may not have gotten the Crimson the victory against Penn, his play had already helped the team to a 3-2 victory against Dartmouth that morning.
Wentzell, number four, and Louis Amira, number five, took care of business early, winning their two matches, which took the pressure off the top three golfers, senior Greg Shuman and sophomores Mark Pollak and Tony Grillo.
“It was a good insurance for the rest of the guys,” Wentzell said. “They were able to take it easy and play with more confidence.”
After defeating the Big Green, the Crimson took on the Quakers and encountered difficulties early as Wentzell and Grillo went down quickly, and Amira seemed to be losing control of an early lead. Grillo and Amira both rallied to win, but losses by Shuman and Pollak forced Wentzell’s match against Williams into the spotlight.
Wentzell had rebounded from his early deficit and was tied with Williams after 18 holes. On the first extra hole, Wentzell was able to get on the green quickly.
“Connor hit an unbelievable approach,” Shuman said.
But he was unable to capitalize and missed his putt for a birdie. Luckily for him, Williams did the same.
Hitting into the wind on the second extra hole, Wentzell settled the ball 20 feet from the cup. Williams was also able to close in on the hole, getting the ball within 12 feet.
“When Connor got the ball 20 feet from the hole, we thought we had it,” Pollak said. “Then the Penn guy got it to 12 feet.”
Once again, it came down to putting.
Just as on the first hole, Wentzell, missed his chance at a birdie. But, this time Williams sunk the put.
“It was really electric,” Pollak said. “All of [Williams’] teammates went kind of crazy. It was a lot of fun, even though it didn’t go our way.”
This weekend marked the first time that Harvard had played match play golf in over forty years, according to Wentzell. Match play means that holes are scored individually and that the matches of all five players count toward the final score. In the more common stroke play, the top four matches are counted toward the final score, which is an accumulation of all the strokes at each hole.
“Match play works for people who are more erratic,” Shuman said. “Every hole is a new match.”
In stroke play, one bad hole could ruin an entire match. In match play, a golfer could shoot a ten on a hole to another player’s three, and it would be no worse than if he had shot a four.
“In match play, you can make high numbers,” Shuman said. “All in all, you’re still trying to play the best golf you can. I play with a lot more ease. I’m not worried about the final score. The one shot you hit is all that matters. What happened on the hole before, what’s going to happen on the next hole doesn’t matter. You’re playing for one hole. It’s just an entirely different game.”
Another way match play alters the game is that it forces a player to think about his own score in relation to his competitors.
“It’s more personal, much more competitive,” Pollak said. “In stroke play, you’re just playing the course. How other people do doesn’t matter until you get to the clubhouse. In match play, you really feel like you’re in the competition. You attack the course in a different method based on what your opponent is doing. There’s always a winner and a loser. You always have competition to judge your performance against. It’s more akin to football and basketball.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After three-straight competitive games against top-20 opponents, the Harvard field hockey team felt it had something to prove when it returned to Ivy League play at Cornell (8-3, 2-2 Ivy League) on Saturday. The Crimson (5-7, 2-2) was coming off three-consecutive non-conference losses to Michigan (6-9), No. 10 Massachusetts (9-4), and Boston University (9-8)—but managed to keep each game within a two goal deficit. Harvard finally turned it around, escaping with a 1-0 victory to even its Ancient Eight record.
“During our last three games, we were playing some great and competitive teams, and we definitely felt we had a great week of practice after keeping it close against Boston University,” co-captain Elizabeth Goodman-Bacon said. “It’s good to win an Ivy game, and it’s great to generate that momentum heading into this week.”
The win evens Harvard’s Ivy League record at 2-2 and pulls it into a three-way tie with the Big Red and Dartmouth for third place in the Ivy League standings.
The lone goal of the game occurred off a penalty corner early in the second half. Sophomore Carly Dickson sent a pass at the right post that Goodman-Bacon was able to tap in for her second goal of the season five minutes into the second half. Freshman goalie Cynthia Tassopoulos secured the Crimson victory by posting eight saves to earn the first shutout of her young career.
“Cynthia played fantastic today, she really kept us in the game,” sophomore Carly Dickson said. “We really went in with the right mindset, and we were great defensively to get the win.”
Despite Cornell holding a 15-10 shot advantage and a 9-4 advantage in penalty corners, Dickson’s corner to Goodman-Bacon was all Tassopoulos, and the Harvard defense needed to even its Ivy League ledger.
“I thought we played great overall,” co-captain Kristin Bannon said. “I thought we did a great job beating them to the ball, and I was really impressed with the way everyone played.”
Harvard had a great chance to stretch the lead to 2-0 later in the second half when Goodman-Bacon finagled the ball past the Big Red goalie, but a Cornell defender swooped in to make a fantastic defensive save. The loss snapped the Big Red’s five-game home winning streak and was only Cornell’s second loss at Dodson Field, the Big Red’s field hockey field since last season.
After opening the season with a strong 3-0 start, the Crimson dropped seven out of eight as conference play and stiffer competition presented itself. With Harvard’s next contest against Ivy League-leading Princeton (11-2, 4-0), a decisive victory couldn’t have come at a better moment.
“I thought we played really well today simply executing our game plan and making sure we did all the things we practiced this past week,” Goodman-Bacon said. “It was really important to play our game, and I was thrilled with the way that we came out against Cornell today. We had a great week of practice, and it was really good to pick up this conference win to propel us to another great week of practice.”
But the Crimson will have its work cut out for it against the nationally fourth-ranked Tigers, as Princeton has won 13-straight Ivy League games and 31-of-32 overall.
“We have a lot of positive energy right now, and we are really ready to just carry this momentum through next week and hopefully sustain it through the rest of Ivy play,” Bannon said.
On the flip side, Harvard opened the season with its best start since 2005, and despite recent setbacks, it doesn’t want to forget the early momentum it generated just yet.
“The past couple games have been tough, but we showed ourselves that we can compete with some really tough teams,” Dickson said. “We definitely built a lot of confidence over the past couple games, and we know now that when we get to playing teams at our level we can really dominate.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the squad split over two races this weekend, some of Harvard cross-country’s less experienced members enjoyed an opportunity to show what they can do. For junior Dan Chenowith and the rest of the veterans, the group only continued to prove its dominance. The Crimson’s top runners traveled to Terre Haute, Ind. Saturday for the NCAA pre-nationals, while another contingent, led primarily by freshmen, competed at the UAlbany Invitational held by the University at Albany.
“I’m really pleased with the weekend overall,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “Both [the men and women] were looking to improve over last year, and we certainly accomplished that.”
The Crimson made strong showings at both events, particularly considering the top-notch talent present in Indiana. Paced by Chenowith’s eighth-place finish, the Harvard men claimed 23rd in a field of 34 teams, while the women relied on a one-two punch of junior Claire Richardson and sophomore Kailyn Kuzmuk to earn 12th out of 36. And on the East Coast, the Crimson rolled to 10th place finishes in both sides of the championship draw, despite fielding a younger squad.
“For the overall development of each individual, we want to make sure they can go to a competition where they can be competitive,” Saretksy explained. “UAlbany gave a lot of other kids an opportunity to be in the top five and score for Harvard…which is exciting for them and a good stepping stone.”
NCAA PRE-NATIONALS
While the women’s team once again had a better showing, the story of the day proved to be Chenowith, whose personal-best 24:01.8 not only netted eighth overall, but left the junior standout just 21 seconds behind top finisher Luke Paskedra of Oregon.
“[Chenowith] did an excellent job,” Saretsky said. “He followed his race plan, got out hard, and put himself in position to be gunning for a top 10 spot. I’m really pleased with the eighth-place finish.”
With two heats at pre-nationals, one needs only to double Chenowith’s finish to gauge his national standing—placing the junior decidedly in the country’s top 20.
The rest of the men followed with consistent efforts in the 8k competition, as the same five runners rounded out the scoring as during the Yale dual meet two weeks ago. Freshman Jeremy Gilmour and junior Ryan Neely crossed the line in 111th and 141st, respectively, while rookies Sean Poherence and Phil Galebach also made their races count. All of the competitors clocked in under 26 minutes, good enough for 23rd overall and a solid improvement over a 28th-place finish in 2008.
Yet the improvement on the women’s side proved even more drastic than the team’s male counterpart, as the Crimson rolled to a 12th-place showing after coming in 21st a year ago. Harvard relied on three top-50 runners to start off the scoring, with freshman Sammy Silva joining Richardson and Kuzmuk at the front. Richardson and Kuzmuk hung together throughout the race, finishing 31st and 33rd with times of 21:19.0 and 21:21.5, respectively.
“[Richardson and Kuzmuk] did really well, and they both improved over last year,” junior captain Jamie Olson said. “They both went out hard and just kept going.”
Olson and fellow junior Eliza Ives rounded out the scoring for the Crimson, marking a highly successful day for the women’s squad.
“A lot of people were not thrilled about how they raced, but overall we did well despite that,” Olson said. “It just shows how much depth we have and how much better we can be later on.”
UALBANY INVITATIONAL
Harvard sent a number of its younger competitors and middle distance runners to the University at Albany Saturday, earning 10th place finishes for the men and women.
The women’s squad placed all five scorers in the top 75, led by rookie Roey Hines, who improved 63 seconds on her previous best with an 18:24.4 on the 5k course. Sophomore Kristen Jorgenson, junior track captain Thea Lee, sophomore Alison Lee, and junior Meghan Houser combined with Hines to average 19:02.4 on the day.
On the men’s side, all five scorers were sophomores or freshmen, with rookie Joe Brancale leading the way.
His time of 25:40.1 marked a 37-second improvement over his previous effort. Sophomore Stephen Couch, freshman Ranvir Dhillion, sophomore Darcy Wilson, and rookie Weishen Mead rounded out the Crimson scorers on the 8k course, leaving Saretsky very encouraged.
“The [younger runners] are doing a great job every day in practice and outside of practice,” the coach said. “It’s great to see them continue to improve, and I think it shows a bright future for Harvard cross-country.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Yet another top-tier basketball recruit has dashed the hopes of the Crimson faithful. Highly-touted prospect Dwight Powell ended his recruitment Saturday, verbally committing to Stanford. The 6’10” center, a Canadian native attending IMG Basketball Academy in Florida, chose to join the Cardinal over Georgia Tech and Harvard.
“…next year I will be attending Stanford harvard is a great institution and has a great coaching staff and I wish them luck with the posative [sic] direction they are going in but Stanford is the place for me,” Powell said via text.
Rated a four-star prospect by Scout.com and the third-best center in the nation by ESPN, Powell rose steadily up the recruiting rankings as an athletic big man with a variety of perimeter skills.
Stanford was long regarded as Powell’s favorite, but his September visit to Cambridge gave some hope that the big man might join the Crimson. In the end, the lures of an athletic scholarship and Pac-10 competition ended up being the difference.
After having missed out on upper-echelon recruits Rod Odom (who committed to Arizona) and Keala King (Arizona State), Harvard coach Tommy Amaker and his staff will now focus their efforts on players more typical of an Ivy program in building upon a recruiting class that so far consists of one commit—Northfield Mount Hermon’s Matt Brown.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After cruising past Columbia and Cornell in its two previous games, the Harvard women’s volleyball team looked to continue its win streak at the Malkin Athletic Center this past weekend. The Crimson (7-10, 3-3 Ivy) split its home games versus two more Ivy League opponents, defeating Princeton (3-12, 1-3), 3-2, on Friday night before falling to Penn (14-4, 5-0) on Saturday, 3-1.
Amongst the mixed success came a numerical feat from senior Lily Durwood.
Against Princeton, the senior passed the 3,000 career assist mark, making her only the third Harvard women’s player to ever accomplish that feat, and she added 30 more versus Penn.
The women’s squad remains in the middle of the pack heading into next weekend at Yale and Brown, where it will seek to emulate previous success on the road.
PENN 3, HARVARD 1
Both the Crimson and the Quakers were coming off of victories when they faced each other on Saturday, and Penn had defeated Harvard in each of their seven previous matchups. That streak would improve to eight as the Crimson lost with scores of 15-25, 24-26, 25-22, 16-25.
Harvard came out with high energy in the first set, scoring its first two points off of consecutive kills by sophomore Sandra Lynne Fryhofer, who had a team-high .375 hitting average for the night. The play that shifted the momentum in Penn’s favor came with the Crimson up 9-5; after co-captain Chelsea Ono Horn served the ball, a series of ferocious spikes and blocks ensued and ultimately resulted in a kill by the Quakers’ Elizabeth Semmens—one of her career-high 26—that made the score 9-6. From there, Penn battled back and won the first set, 25-15.
The score in the second set stayed close throughout; Harvard forced overtime but fell 26-24. In the third set, junior Mikaelle Comrie led the Crimson with three of her team-high 15 kills to a 25-22 victory.
Harvard could not sustain its momentum in the fourth set, and Penn’s Semmens could not be stopped. The Quakers won the set, 25-16.
The Crimson put up a fight defensively, out-blocking Penn 10-9, but the Quakers were too much to handle offensively. Penn had a 61-46 advantage over Harvard in kills and a 58-48 advantage in digs.
HARVARD 3, PRINCETON 2
In its first match of the weekend, Harvard was set to face the Tigers, who beat the Crimson in the two teams’ last 12 contests. Harvard’s victory over Princeton was its first since October 26, 2002.
“[The Tigers] have quite a record over us,” Harvard coach Jennifer Weiss said. “So that was a great win. I could feel that some of our offensive systems would take them by surprise. So it was really a great team effort.”
The Crimson came out of the gate with intensity, winning the first set, 25-23. Errors and miscommunication set in and began to disrupt play, and the Crimson dropped the second and third sets with scores of 25-19 and 25-16.
“I think in the second [set], Princeton turned it on a little,” Coach Weiss said. “The idea is to earn points and not make so many unforced errors.”
“We lost momentum in the second and third games,” sophomore Anne Carroll Ingersoll said. “We weren’t talking to each other as much. We weren’t as much of a unit as we were, especially in the first game, when we were just on and together. I think we were able to learn from the games we lost.”
Harvard stole back the momentum during the fourth set, winning 25-16, and the Crimson was able to seal the deal in overtime in the fifth set, 16-14.
Three Harvard players notched double-digit kills in the match. Freshman Taylor Docter led the team with 14 kills and Ingersoll added 12 kills along with eight blocks. Ono Horn and Comrie also added nine kills apiece, while sophomore Christine Wu led all players with 34 digs.
In addition to Durwood’s 3000th assist, the Crimson notched several records as a team on Friday: it recorded a season-high 13 blocks and a season-best 98 digs.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s water polo team dropped back-to-back games at home this weekend. On Saturday, in the conference final against Fordham, the Crimson (5-16, 3-3 CWPA) lost 12-7. Less than 24 hours later, Harvard was in the pool again to face St. Francis College (10-3) in the last game before the CWPA Northern Division Championships on Nov. 7. The Crimson hung tight with a dominant Terriers team throughout the first half, but was ultimately blown away, 18-10.
ST FRANCIS 18, HARVARD 10
In the Crimson’s 18-10 loss to St. Francis yesterday, Harvard tied its record for most goals allowed in a game and once again struggled against a tough non-conference foe.
The Crimson played strongly for the first half, taking a few leads and playing strong defense against a very talented Terrier squad.
“We took a lot of pride in the way we played the first half,” co-captain Egan Atkinson said. “It just shows us that we can play great water polo when we piece together our game.”
Harvard junior co-captain Brett Voith struck first for the Crimson, which exchanged goals with St, Francis and took a 2-1 lead early in the first quarter. St. Francis—after over four minutes of failed attempts—scored on a low, skipping shot in the last second to tie it up.
Voith found the net again early in the second quarter, and the battle resumed. But at 4-4 with just over four minutes remaining, a penalty on Harvard resulted in a lapse in defense. A Terrier player sprinted undefended down the length of the pool, effortlessly lobbed it over the head of sophomore goaltender Alexandre Popp, and secured St. Francis’ first lead of the game.
“We made a couple of mistakes,” said fifth-year head coach Erik Farrar. “A team like St. Francis is going to make you pay with goals for that.”
The Terriers took their lead and never looked back. While Popp made some skillful saves, St. Francis tallied two more goals before halftime and walked into the locker room with a lead of 7-4.
In the third quarter, the Crimson’s fatigue showed. The team got into foul trouble early, and by the end of the game was playing with three players fouled out and another two sidelined with injuries.
“The big thing was [that] we got into foul trouble and didn’t have any subs,” Atkinson said.  “Having five guys who normally contribute a lot not playing in the same half...hopefully all that is different in three weeks.”
St. Francis built its lead throughout the third and fourth quarters, acquiring little-needed insurance. But Harvard didn’t relent on offense, with junior Alex Thompson scoring two pretty goals in the last four minutes to complete his hat trick.
“I was really, really pleased with our effort,” Farrar said. “These guys played a passionate, ass-kicking, fiery kind of water polo, and we [just] have to tighten it up.  A lot of great things happened in this game.”
FORDHAM 12, HARVARD 7
On Saturday, the Crimson fell to Fordham, 12-7, in its last conference matchup, evening its record to 3-3.
The team came out strong and was in good position at halftime. But things fell apart in the second half, in which Harvard was outscored 5-1.
“There was one good half and one not so good half, pure and simple,” Farrar said. “Getting outscored, 5-1, in the second half just can’t happen again.”
“We have the talent,” Voith added. “We have the system. We have the offense, the defense. But we need four quarters.”
The coaches and players also praised the Crimson’s four seniors, who played in their last regular-season games this weekend. Atkinson, Thomas Bailey, Nikhil Balaraman, and Dan Furman will swim again for Harvard in Blodgett Pool at Northerns, with one last postseason run to secure their legacies.
“They’ve been a big part of our success over the years,” Farrar said. “They’ve done a great job of holding the team on focus and on task.”
“They provide the leadership,” Voith added. “That’s why it’s important to have a day [for seniors] like this...to get them fired up for their last couple games.”
Harvard now turns its attention to Northerns, the first of the two end-of-season tournaments, where the Crimson will most likely face off against cross-town rival M.I.T. The tournament is three weeks away, and the team feels that it has the opporunity to improve in that time.
“We’ve got a lot of training to do, sharpening up,” Farrar said. “It will be a very enjoyable contest.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming into the final competition of its 2009 fall schedule, the Harvard women’s golf team was feeling confident about its most recent play. Having won its previous tournament at Yale, the Crimson traveled to the Saucon Valley Country Club, located in Bethlehem, Penn., to compete in the Kelly Gutshall Invitational hosted by Lehigh University this past weekend. But with the onset of winter weather throughout much of the Northeast, the Harvard squad was not even sure it would be able to try to end its fall campaign on a high note this weekend.
“The biggest thing for us this weekend was the weather,” captain Claire Sheldon said. “We were anticipating difficult conditions. Snow was in the forecast, so they pushed back the tee times on Saturday, but we got lucky and did not even have rain.”
With clear—albeit cold—skies, the Crimson was able to assert its dominance over four fellow Ivy League squads and five other teams from schools located throughout the Northeast, as the two-time defending Ancient Eight champions took home the team title.
But the victory did not come easy. After 18 holes and the close of Day 1’s competition, the Crimson found itself six strokes back of a strong Columbia Lions squad, having its four scoring golfers combine for a final tally of 318 on the day.
“We don’t really pay attention to other teams out there on the course,” Sheldon said. “We try our best on every shot and being behind didn’t really change our game plan.”
Concerned or not, Harvard responded well on Day 2, improving its day one score by three strokes to finish with a final tally of 633 (318-315-633).
“Playing in rain is not that bad, and playing in the cold is not that bad,” Sheldon said, “but when the two are combined, it is pretty tough to compete out on the golf course, so we were lucky to only have to deal with the cold factor and were able to succeed on day two.”
Columbia finished three strokes back, as Ancient Eight squads took four of the top-five team places after the two days and 36 holes of competition.
Individually, the Crimson were led by highly-touted freshman Katie Sylvan, who bettered a score of 78 on the first day by one stroke on the second day, to finish with a final tally of 155 (78-77-155). The Southern California native placed third overall on the weekend, just a shot back of the lead on the par-72 course.
“Coming from San Diego, Katie had never really played in these types of cold conditions, so that makes her performance that much more impressive,” Sheldon said. “We will continue to look to her to pace the team throughout the rest of the year and into the future.”
Sylvan competed in three of the Crimson’s four fall tournaments, and based on her high school career, should be able to compete with the Ivy League’s best come the spring season.
“It was a difficult adjustment learning how to balance work and golf in college,” Sylvan said, “but you have to do the best you can, and it has so far been a great experience.”
Sheldon shot a pair of 79s to place in a tie for eighth with a score of 158 on the weekend. Rookie Chloe Altchek and sophomore Christine Cho rounded out Harvard’s scoring golfers, both shooting +16, which was good enough to earn them both a tie for 12th place among the 48 competitors that finished the 36 holes of play.
“This was Chloe’s first tournament for us this season,” Sheldon said. “She was a little more used to the conditions coming from New York and was able to compete well.”
Junior Mia Kabasakalis was Harvard’s final competitor and shot 169 (86-83), which earned her a tie for 26th place.
The Crimson will now rest throughout the winter months and prepare for the main portion of its schedule in the spring.
“The fall went really well for us,” Sheldon said, “but other teams also played well. This will help keep us motivated throughout the winter because we know we are going to have a competitive spring season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hippies have Woodstock. Movie buffs has the Cannes. Rowing fans have the Head of the Charles.
This weekend, thousands of crew enthusiasts from across the world flocked to Cambridge for the 45th Annual Head of the Charles Regatta. For them, it was a chance to see rowing at its most elite, with various national teams taking the water, in addition to the much-vaunted “Great Eight”—a boat comprised of the world’s eight fastest scullers.
For Harvard men’s heavyweight and lightweight crews, it was a chance to gauge their progress as they work towards the more competitive spring season while enjoying the weekend’s electric atmosphere.
“This year, we had the boathouse swarmed with Olympians and people from various national teams,” lightweight captain Martin Eiermann said. “It’s always a special atmosphere. We all came into the weekend being really excited.”
The regatta’s appeal was dampened, quite literally, by rain and then snow on Sunday, but both squads came away from the weekend satisfied with their production.
“I thought it was really good,” heavyweight captain Blake Pucsek said. “We had crews place similarly to how they did in past years, which is a good sign.”
The heavyweights put their top rowers in the Championship Men’s Fours race, where a Harvard boat directed by junior coxswain Chris Kingston and rowed by Pucsek, senior Richard Anderson, and juniors Anthony Locke and David Wakulich finished in third. The Crimson spent most of the race in hot pursuit of the Camp Randall Rowing Club—the eventual second-place finisher.
“They took a lot of the distance between us very quickly, but then we kind of dug in,” Pucsek said. “At the end we tried to push away, and we came within two seconds [of Camp Randall].”
Harvard’s other four, coxed by senior Joseph Lin, came in eighth.
The Crimson also placed three boats in the Men’s Championship Eights race, which finished in 18th, 22nd, and 24th. The 18th-place boat, a sophomore crew coxed by second-year Alex Sopko, who is also a Crimson sports editor, finished in 15:28.495—under a minute behind the Great Eight, who won the race. The other two boats, including one rowed entirely by freshman, were only seconds behind.
“I think that’s great,” Pucsek said of the young rowers’ performance. “This is the future, right?”
The Harvard heavyweights also raced boats in the Men’s Club Fours and Men’s Club Eights, giving the Crimson a chance to display its depth and give its less-experienced rowers a taste of competition.
Even 73-year-old Harry Parker, the men’s heavyweight coach for the last 46 years, got in the action, racing in the Senior-Veterans Singles Men’s race.
“Harry’s been rowing in every single one of these things,” Pucsek said. “It’s awesome having a coach that takes part.”
On the lightweight side, the Crimson raced four boats—including three in the Lightweight Men’s Eights and one in the Lightweight Men’s Fours.
In the eights, Harvard sent out its three varsity boats. The 1V rowed impressively, finishing in third place based on its raw time of 15:36.607, but the Crimson was dealt a 60-second penalty which bumped it down to 18th. According to Eiermann, the boat starting ahead of Harvard got caught up in the buoys. The Crimson eight, already building up its speed, passed the entangled boat before the line and was penalized for starting in the wrong order.
Harvard is appealing the decision.
“Im pretty positive that with our appeal we might be able to get rid of that penalty,” Eiermann said. “Nothing on our part was intentional. I don’t think we got an advantage out of it.”
As for the race itself, Eiermann was pleased with his boat’s performance despite the less than ideal weather conditions.
“We couldn’t expect to be rowing pretty and feeling nice,” Eiermann said. “You have to have some guts and just go after it. When we hit the headwind, we stayed very strong. [Senior coxswain Dexter Louie] made some very good calls.”
The Crimson 2V finished in 10th place, while the 3V came in 20th. Harvard also raced a 14th-place boat in the Lightweight Championship Fours.
Eiermann was especially pleased with the performance of the Crimson sophomores, who burst onto the collegiate scene in the spring, dominating freshman races for much of the season. At the Head of the Charles, four sophomores rowed on the 1V, while two more raced for the 2V.
“The sophomore class is so strong,” Eiermann said. “They’ve surprised a lot of the older guys on the team. They’re putting on a serious challenge.”
With the Head of the Charles behind them, the Harvard heavyweights and lightweights have an idea of where they stack up against top-notch competition and can draw on this experience as they continue training and competing with the spring season in sight.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the first snow fell on the Charles River Sunday afternoon, the Radcliffe women’s lightweight and heavyweight crews competed in the 45th Annual Head of the Charles Regatta. The Black and White lightweight varsity eight earned a top-five finish with a time of 18:26.343, while its second varsity eight counterpart finished in 19:01.044, good for 11th place in the 14-boat race.
Radcliffe’s top-two heavyweight boats competed in a field of 32 entries, with the first varsity eight finishing 13th in 17:24.968 and the Black and White’s second varsity eight boat placing 22nd in 17:56.641.
The Radcliffe lightweights had positive feelings about the weekend’s races, especially in light of the strange, wintry weather.
“I thought the race was great,” said junior varsity lightweight Leah Schwartz. “The lightweight women had an outstanding performance despite cold and windy conditions...we stayed composed and finished in a good place.”
“I am pleased with the results,” added Radcliffe lightweight coach Heather Cartwright. “I think we still have some work to do, but I’m happy with how the girls performed given the weather today.”
The Black and White lightweight eight finished in third place third among collegiate varsity crews, falling behind only Wisconsin—which won the race—and Georgetown—which finished third. More impressive was the comeback run the Radcliffe lightweight women achieved against rival Princeton.
Despite being behind the Tigers in the final stretch, the Black and White posed a strong finish, making a late push and crossing the line two seconds ahead of Princeton.
Considering that next up for the Radcliffe lightweight teams is the Princeton Chase next weekend, the result is a good—although not conclusive—sign of what to expect when the crew takes on its Ivy opponent.
“We’re only two seconds ahead of Princeton, a very narrow margin, but the race provides the chance to improve upon what we did today,” Cartwright said.
Without a follow-up race to look forward to, the Black and White heavyweight squads were not as pleased with the results of their respective results at the regatta.
“I think that the team didn’t do as well as we hoped,” said varsity heavyweight captain Christine Baugh. “I think everyone went out and raced as hard as they could, and it’s just important for us to see where we are today and use that as a springboard to work harder.”
The Black and White varsity heavyweights finished ninth among collegiate crews, passing by local rivals Northeastern and Dartmouth.
“Of course we’re not happy if we don’t win,” said Radcliffe heavyweight coach Liz O’Leary. “But as long as we did the best we can do, that’s all I can ask. Every time [the heavyweight teams] go out and race, I’m proud of them, although today was not the performance they’re capable of.”
Although the heavyweight crews did not have ideal finishes, the team understood that it was taking on some of the top competition in the world.
“We have to recognize that there are three or four national team crews,” O’Leary said. “Stanford and Yale had really good races...and today just gave us a sense of what we already knew, that it’s a competitive field.”
Stanford—which won the team national title last spring—and Yale have won the last three varsity eight races at NCAAs.
“It wasn’t our best race,” Baugh said. “But this gives us a lot of room to improve technically and continue improving on fitness. Spring season is a long way away, and we just need to continue working to our end-of-the-season goals.”
Both coaches agree that the results today are not a gauge of the spring season.
“This weekend is no indication for the upcoming season,” O’Leary said. “Fall is a very different animal than spring racing.”
“Results in the fall don’t always tell us the story of the results in the spring,” Cartwright agreed. “The fall season is intended to give us the incentive to work harder and be motivated for the spring.”
The Black and White will have plenty of time to tune up for the spring season, with just a few weeks of fall competition left, culminating with the Foot of the Charles on Nov. 14.

With Harvard's old heating systems and generally non-existent air-conditioning, it is of little surprise that during this transition from the uncomfortably warm Cambridge summer to the unbearably cold Cambridge winter some students would find the temperature of their rooms less than satisfactory. (Yeah, it snowed today.)
Since the beginning of the month e-mails have been hitting House lists asking, in one form or another, "When is the heat getting turned on?"
One member of Winthrop House went apple picking and returned to a cold room, emailing Winthrop House to find out when it would get a little warmer. Responded a Winthrop senior, helpfully:
Another responded with knowledge that seemed to be gained from first hand experience:
It's advice that appears to have been particularly pertinent for Eliot residents, who over the weekend complained of sweltering conditions and radiators like the surface of the sun. More, after the jump.
Each House has to cope with its own unique radiator problems and start dates—and of course there is no universal agreement on when heating is needed. With recent budget cuts, including the loss of hot breakfast, some students if only sarcastically have expressed skepticism that heat will be turned on sometime soon. One Kirkland resident joked,
While some Houses have begun to turn their heat on, two weeks ago one Quincy House resident worried he would not make it to the winter.
I have no glove. I have no fire. I have no brightly colored peruvian hat. My roommates cannot type without mittens and they have no mittens or they would agree.
We cannot get out. We cannot get out. It is coming.

Glamorous media job.  Expensive clothing. Expensive shoes.  Adorable best guy friend who turns out to be the love of your life. Are these classic elements of a bad romantic comedy, or are they the stuff your dreams are made of?  Well, get a job with Her Campus—which is now hiring—and maybe, just maybe, your future can become a chick flick come true.  (Okay, minus the part about the best guy friend. No guarantees on that one.)
Her Campus, a student-run online magazine for college women that hopes to be a kind of savior for the dying print media industry, has been sending out emails advertising opportunities to “gain work experience” with “a growing entrepreneurial team” and “work with top brands like Juicy Couture and Victoria’s Secret.”  The following unpaid positions are available: Publicity Associate, Finance Associate, Social Media Associate, and most curiously, Beauty Associate.
Hmm.  Most of those seem pretty standard, but “Beauty Associate”?  What does that even mean?  See our musings after the jump.
So what exactly would a Beauty Associate’s job entail? Would she (or he) be a wannabe Anna Wintour, dictating makeup tips and style advice?  Would she be in charge of helping Her Campus perpetuate the single standard of beauty touted by just about all fashion and women’s magazines? What if an applicant has a really grotesque sense of beauty, one that doesn’t conform to the mostly thin, mainstream, well-manicured version that Her Campus (so far) seems to support?  (Yes, we mean, what if you think the applicant is ugly?)
We contacted Her Campus to inquire more about this and the other jobs, but we have so far not received a response.
Now, even though FlyBy has definitely been guilty of snarking on Her Campus in the past, we’ll say now that we do think it’s great whenever young entrepreneurs—especially women—start their own businesses.  So, for that reason, the fact that Her Campus exists is actually pretty cool.  But the magazine claims that it represents “the future of online media” and “responds directly to the needs of college women.”  We’d argue that a lot of Her Campus’ content is neither particularly revolutionary nor universally insightful. (The daily poll today was, “What color nail polish are you wearing right now?”)
Granted, this FlyBy correspondent is an unfashionable cheapskate who only recently learned to appreciate the wonders of an eyelash curler—probably not the kind of candidate Her Campus would want to hire anyway (especially as a Beauty Associate).  Which, of course, is totally fair.
