After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Disney’s recent announcement that it plans to release a new Star Wars movie every year until 2020 marks yet another potentially superfluous multi-movie franchise. From classics like “Jaws” and “Die Hard” to newer series like “Pirates of the Caribbean” and “Transformers,” more often than not, franchises start out strong and suffer an inevitable decline in quality. Why is the American film industry so franchise-oriented?
Franchises are popular partly because people don’t want to see a beloved story reach its conclusion. Rather than accept that their favorite characters’ story has come to an end, audiences would rather let it drag on. The Star Wars franchise, for example, is important to many people because they grew up with it. Franchises may thus arise from a need to cling to a childhood or past memory, a time when things were easier to deal with than the pains of growing older.
Studios that produce franchises are like parents who let their children watch an extra 15 minutes of their favorite television show—enablers who feed into an addiction. The popularity of these franchises is only propagating a vicious cycle: The more people watch these franchises, the more popular they are, the more money studios earn, the more franchises are made. Since audiences aren’t willing to end the cycle, neither are studios. Why fix something that isn’t broken? Studios, like people, avoid delving into new territory out of fear that whatever new venture they take on might not be financially successful and instead prefer to beat the same dead horse that made them rich.
Franchises further perpetuate the aforementioned cycle by introducing new characters, who in turn launch the story into another narrative. The public’s familiarity with well-known material facilitates the switch into semi-new content; people will be more willing to dip their feet in similar waters than to dive into the deep end.
Thus arises the Hollywood crisis that has been bubbling under the surface for years now: Studios would rather make money than produce good content, resulting in a steady decline in the quality of movies. How many franchises have held strong all the way through, from the first movie to the last? An overwhelming majority have taken the opposite trajectory. The few exceptions—“Toy Story,” “Harry Potter,” and “Lord of the Rings,” among others—have escaped such a fate thanks to strong source material and an ever-faithful fanbase. But with both studios and audiences refusing to acknowledge the need to let this craze die, we may unfortunately be in for some drawn-out franchises ruining original content that would, if left alone, stand stronger on its own.

A blast from a parked car, set off in the middle of a crowded market in Delhi, India, catalyzes the events of Karan Mahajan’s second novel, “The Association of Small Bombs.” “A good bombing begins everywhere at once,” Mahajan states in his opening paragraph; in a way, so does this novel. “The Association of Small Bombs” opens with the rich and widespread material of loss, terror, and the skeleton of a family—the married couple Vikas and Deepa Khurana, who serve as the novel’s protagonists. In its unfolding, the plotline traverses dimensions of grief through the diverse narratives of the characters most centrally involved with or impacted by the explosion. Mahajan delves into the most pressing urgencies of the human experience and twists the reader’s sympathies with tremendous dexterity. He accomplishes all of this within beautifully sparkling prose—a rare combination that makes “The Association of Small Bombs” an indubitable standout.
Mahajan’s novel occupies the space of a vividly rendered Delhi that is colorful, crowded, and composed of a tense combination of Hindus and Muslims.  After a “small” bombing—with 13 total victims—kills the Khurana’s two sons while they are out running an errand at an outdoor market, Deepa and Vikas are left to grapple with the fundamental tragedy of their lives. In the midst of grief, they soon conceive and have a daughter, who chronically upsets her father with her cheerful disposition. The novel also follows Mansoor, the son of the Khuranas’ only Hindu friends and, at 12 years old, a survivor of the explosion that led to the death of the Khurana boys. Mansoor survives with only a wrist injury, but the trauma cleaves his life in two. He refuses to go outside throughout his adolescence and becomes involved in computer programming, which lands him a spot at a university in California. There, he endures American anti-Islamic sentiment in the wake of 9/11 until his wrist injury spirals into debilitating carpal tunnel syndrome and forces him to return to Delhi. The novel deftly navigates these multiple perspectives in the aftermath of the bombing.
In the midst of the victim’s narratives, however, Mahajan forces us to spend time with an entirely different set of characters: the terrorists. We meet Shockie, the masterful bomb-maker who looks like your average electrician—a man incredibly frustrated with the incompetent organization of his bosses and who believes in terror as the only way to call attention to the perspectives of Kashmiri Muslims. Shockie primarily remains a villain, but Mahajan does generate sympathy for his best friend, Malik, whom Shockie protects within the dynamics of their organization. Subsequently, the novel follows a character who abandons nonviolent methods for terrorism, a narrative move that deeply humanizes him and his motives. The cumulative effect on the reader is an unsettling understanding of the terrorist’s position, which deepens the novel’s tragedy.
Mahajan uses the bomb itself, overlaid with glittering imagery and theoretical language, as the central metaphor of his book. Within the opening pages, he writes: “This is what it felt like to be a bomb. You were coiled up, majestic with blackness, unaware that the universe outside you existed, and then a wire snapped and ripped open your eyelids all the way around and you had a vision of the world that was 360 degrees, and everything in your purview was doomed by seeing.” The idea of a person as a kind of bomb, with explosion imminent, adds profound and unusual depth to his characters. As the book progresses, Mahajan integrates the vocabulary of shock waves, shrapnel, and debris into depictions of character development and intertwines it with a representation of toppling family life. In the novel’s closing pages, he connects this metaphor to the novel’s domestic sphere: “What was a bomb, really?  A means of separation, of opening.  A factory of undoing…. A bomb was a child.”
In addition to its startlingly intense imagery, “The Association of Small Bombs” provides a valuable perspective on an issue that is increasingly salient in our society. Why do bombings in the West garner massive international attention, while terror in the Middle East and South Asia is regarded as mundane? In his exploration of this discrepancy, Mahajan illuminates the unique horror of these bombings that are considered commonplace. It is a tragedy of ignored pain; a tragedy of the media’s selective attention, which encourages large-scale terror; and, above all, a tragedy of forgetting. There will be no memorials for the Khurana children, just as there was no compensation or vengeance served for their death.

Democracy in America has never seemed so spectacular as now, when we’re knee deep in this many-monthed primary campaign whose topsy-turviness has cast Ted Cruz as the Republican establishment’s great last hope and placed a socialist senator in serious competition with the Clintons. Our European neighbors must be thoroughly tickled. But how democratic are these ballyhooed elections anyway, replete as they are with their mutinous delegates and their conspiring “super” kin?
At present, both the Democratic and Republicans Parties are beset with accusations of sanctimony and sabotage, and not undeservedly. Bernie Sanders, who has swept eight of the previous nine primaries, and his supporters inveigh against the so-called superdelegates—party bigwigs who vote as they choose. Truly super, since they possess votes worth 10,000 times more than the ordinary, undecorated citizen.  469 of these special individuals have already sworn fealty to Hillary Clinton. Sanders can muster up only a paltry 31. That Sanders could obliterate Clinton in New Hampshire by 22 points in February, yet still emerge with no advantage in delegate count due to support from the party elite, is the clearest proof of the system’s inadequacy.
Overall, superdelegates will account for 15 percent of the delegate total at the Democratic National Convention. I’ll mention in passing that in Iran, all candidates for president must similarly garner the approval of the Guardian Council, which is composed of six highly esteemed and well-credentialed worthies. “That’s much more undemocratic,” you may protest. Sure, but only seven times as much.
Another quirk of our democracy is the delightfully quaint caucus system, which requires voters to take a few hours out of their evenings and argue the merits of their preferred candidates in a room full of neighbors, rather than merely casting their vote and being done with the matter. Only the most motivated voters seem to turn up to these lengthy shows of Rousseauian democracy, but even more byzantine procedures can nullify even the votes of even these most dedicated of partisans.
In the Democratic Iowa caucuses, perhaps the most important, votes are discarded if a candidate does not meet a 15 percent threshold. A number of ties this year were even decided by coin toss. For a party that vigorously campaigns against the vote-suppressing laws that have cropped up in some Republican-led states, the Democrats' retention of caucuses remains a bizarre outcrop from the party-boss days that essentially disenfranchises entire classes of voters arbitrarily. Caucuses should go the way of superdelegates—straight to the dustbin of history.
In spite of what I will lovingly call America’s “institutional eccentricities,” most electoral processes manage to select the candidate whom the actual majority voted for. That’s because massive margins of victory are difficult to squirrel away behind superdelegate disdain or caucus shenanigans. But in tightly-contested races, such as today’s, the anti-democratic pull of these idiosyncrasies can come to dominate, leaving the outcome to either dumb luck or campaign savviness with superficial technicalities. That’s how our hopelessly antiquated, but constitutionally enshrined, Electoral College gave us George Bush over Al Gore, who won the popular vote.
Unlike the Electoral College, reformation of the party nominating process would not require a constitutional amendment. Of course, possibility of reform is a far cry from its realization, as any non-comatose political observer would tell you. According to Brookings, there are at least 153 actors—when you take into account all the state parties and legislatures—who split control over our current primary process and “absent some sort of meltdown, a more rational system is not likely any time soon.”
And that’s where Donald Trump might amount to some good after all. “Our Republican system is absolutely rigged. It’s a phony deal,” the self-styled master dealmaker angrily called out on Tuesday. He’s absolutely right, for once: Republican leaders are all but openly scheming to steal the nomination from Trump if he does not win an absolute majority of delegates, though he is almost certain to win a commanding plurality.
As we’ve seen, in a contested convention, an increasing number of delegates become “unbound” to their state’s primary and caucus results with each round, presumably spoiling the chances of Trump in favor of Ted Cruz or even an unnamed white knight. This of course would make a mockery of the many millions of Republican primary voters. Democracy ought to be about giving people want they want—even if it’s someone as distasteful as Trump. Leave the dramatic reinventions to the 2016 autopsy instead.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you happened to fly into Boston and were lucky enough to snag a window seat, you might have had a glimpse at Yale. Google Maps says the arts and crafts college to our south is just 133 miles away. Via plane, that’s a short 10 minutes. On a train, that’s a modest 90 minutes. By car, traffic could push the trip to a few hours. But on campus in New Haven, it is an interminably long four years.
While Harvard has some flaws—and we are rarely hesitant in pointing them out—choosing between the best university and the 1,270th best college in the world is not much of a choice. Sure, Yale has a social scene (whatever that means), gothic architecture, and persuasive recruitment videos (or not). But it also has New Haven, godlessness, and George W. Bush—not to mention the poopetrator.
Of course, we do not mean to disparage New Haven’s premier school of clowning. After all, as Liz Lemon once put it, Yale is the Harvard of central Connecticut. But comparing Harvard to Yale is like comparing Kobe Bryant to an IM baller.
We have Franklin Delano Roosevelt (a former president of The Crimson); they have William Howard Taft. We have Jeremy Lin; they have Chris Dudley (who?). We have The Harvard Crimson; they have the Yale Daily News. Do you use Facebook? As Al Gore (a Harvard graduate) once said of the Internet, we took the initiative in creating that.
It should be noted that getting into Yale is an achievement of which to be proud. An acceptance rate of 6.5 percent is startlingly selective. (Though not, of course, in comparison to 5.3 percent). And while Yale may have lost its ninth consecutive Harvard-Yale game this fall, it did succeed in winning one of the last 15.
Yale student née Harvard student Sam B. Clark ‘15 once said, “Some people criticize Yale for not being right across the river from a big city like Boston, but I would say, you know, Boston is three hours away—it’s almost like being there.” Clark is right. 133 miles isn’t that far.
So, Yalies, don’t be too dismayed: You were pretty close to getting into Harvard. Or, rather, you got into something pretty close to Harvard. Don’t worry, there’s always grad school.
And for those of you just admitted to this august institution, we can’t promise you it’ll be perfect. We can’t promise you that you won’t have good moments and bad, tears of joy and of sadness, times of success and of failure. But we can promise you it will happen with people who reserve their poops for the bathroom, with a faculty whose most popular course is given in the flesh, and at a university that bothered to come up with an original motto. Welcome to Harvard.

Hello. You don’t even go here (yet) and you’re snooping around the school newspaper. Yes, I’m talking to you, newly admitted Harvard students. Thank you for taking the time away from stalking people from the Class of 2020 Facebook page to read this.
Every year The Crimson runs some variation of the “come to Harvard” op-ed and for good reason. It’s good advice. Harvard College is a unique, exciting place. You should enroll and experience it for yourself.
But first, you should take a gap year.
This isn’t novel advice. In fact, just last week, Abigail Falik published an article in The New York Times making the same argument.
Falik delineates some of American higher education’s “costs,” which include far more than just the high tuition rates. With homogeneous student bodies, opaque admissions processes and even the chance of catching mumps (at least, if you’re heart is set on Cambridge), there are no shortage of problems to innumerate and there is little students can do to fix them. But Falik argues, and rightly so, that there is one thing we, as students, can control: our readiness for college.
Throughout the college process, my parents did not push the idea of a gap year, but they did leave the option wide open. After visiting a campus, for instance, my dad might ask, “can you imagine yourself here next year… or, you know, the year after that?”
I was not amused. The thought of planning what I would do for the next 365 days, on top of slogging through the usual college process, seemed unbearable. I walked across the stage at my high school graduation fully intending to move into the Yard a few months later. I had taken my placement exams (ugh), filled out the rooming survey (eek) and signed up for FOP (DO IT)!
But I was truly apathetic about what was coming my way and absolutely petrified by the shenanigans in the class of 2017 Facebook page. Instead of googling for bedspreads that would match my future roommates’ décor, I was searching for things I could feasibly do with my time if I weren’t to go straight to school.
When I finally wrote Harvard over July 4th weekend asking to defer my enrollment, all I knew was that there was an outdoors center in New Zealand that took volunteers in exchange for room and board. I figured I would sort the rest out later.
And I did. And I could go on and on about the skills I learned, the friends I made, and the places I went.
But this article isn’t about why a gap year was right for me. It’s about why it is right for you, regardless of who you are exactly.
Peruse the Internet for information on gap years and you’ll get a plethora of results touting their benefits. And yet, it’s easy to feel a disconnect. After all, it’s hard to imagine how your expected Harvard GPA could possibly go up by .1 to .4 points after taking a gap year, given the infamous grade inflation. And you might not be inclined to read beyond the title of Dean Fitzsimmon’s article, included in your admissions packet, regarding “burnout,” if you’re one of those seniors who are sailing through senior spring.
But if you look closely, you’ll find that many arguments for taking a gap year are universal. The authors of The Gap Year Advantage found that one of the most highly rated outcomes that gap year students report is gaining a better sense of who they are. In a survey conducted by The American Gap Association, 97% of respondents reported that their gap year increased their maturity and 96% reported that it increased their confidence.
If expensive eurotrips and costly programs comprise your current conception of gap years, you may also be inclined to dismiss them for being outside your means. But few, if any, statistics specify different outcomes depending on what students did during their gap years or how much money they spent. That’s probably because it doesn’t matter. Whether you stay at home and work, hike the Pacific Coast Trail, or volunteer for City Year, your gap year can be a valuable experience—as long as you're doing something you want to be doing.
This article (and many others out there like it) is not saying a gap year will solve all your problems. It’s also not saying that if you don’t take a gap year, you will be doomed to fail. There will be nights you are stressed whether you are in the class of 2020 or 2021. There will be days when you are sad at Harvard—like when it snows on April 4th—regardless of whether you defer. But taking a gap year can’t hurt your ability to handle the curveballs. It won’t make you less prepared to take advantage of all the things that make choosing Harvard such a good idea. In fact, it will probably do the opposite.
So, welcome to Harvard! If you’re coming to Visitas, enjoy! And then, get the heck out of here and join the class of 2021.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Preparations are underway for the freshman formal, an annual dance for the freshman class, which will be held this year under the Science Center Plaza tent on the semester’s last day of classes, April 27.
For the past few months, the First Year Social Committee has been working “tirelessly” with the Freshman Dean’s Office in order to put the event together, Torey E. Martin, the FDO's fellow for First-Year Programs, said.
This will be the second year in a row that the freshman formal will be held on campus, rather than at a hotel in the Boston area. According to Martin, following last year’s success, the organizing committee opted to host the event on campus. Holding the formal under the Science Center Plaza tent makes the event not only logistically easier, but also more accessible to students who no longer need to go through the hassle of navigating the T or ordering Ubers.
“We are hoping that students find that this year’s dance will be equally as successful, if not more successful, that it becomes a tradition to have it on campus,” Martin said. “It’s very special to have it under the tent.”
Jamie A. Hawkins ’19, co-chair of the freshman formal, anticipates participation for this year’s dance will be even greater than last year.
“I think [participation] will go up because a lot of people last year were skeptical about having it on campus, much less in the Science Center tent,” Hawkins said. “But when they found out how cool it was and how amazing it was, people really came out.”
Two years ago, freshman formal was held at the Seaport Boston Hotel. The hotel staff called an early end to the event because of liability concerns related to intoxicated students.
This year’s dance will have a woodlands-type theme, with white drapery and soft lighting to set the ambiance, Martin said. The anticipated 1,200 attendees will be able to enjoy a formal dinner at Annenberg Dining Hall first and then head out to the tent for a DJ and food.
“Students are encouraged to get out their finest gear and come out and enjoy the evening,” Martin said.
Furthermore, Martin said the organizing committee has prioritized safety. As such, they have been in constant contact with HUPD and Securitas to “make sure the night goes smoothly for everyone.”
Franci Van Rhyn ’19, co-chair of the freshman formal, advised that students should pick up their tickets early.
“Last year, just before the formal, there were really long lines in front of the box office. It was definitely a last minute craze,” Van Rhyn said.
Tickets are available online and at the box office, which has moved to Farkas Hall following construction on the Smith Campus Center.

UPDATED: April 14, 2016, at 11:15 p.m.
On a day when workers and students took to the streets across the country to rally for minimum wage reform, over 200 Harvard affiliates gathered in front of Massachusetts Hall to push for higher wages and increased health benefits for Harvard’s dining services employees.
The rally comes on the heels of the announcement earlier this week that Harvard made history in fundraising for its capital campaign, surpassing all of its peer institutions to yield an unprecedented amount of at least $6.5 billion in donations thus far.
Harvard is currently the world’s wealthiest university, touting a $37.6 billion endowment. Referencing the University's financial strength, demonstrators marched in a circle chanting “Hey Harvard, you’ve got cash, why do you treat your employees like trash?” among other phrases.
Tania DeLuzuriaga, a spokesperson for the University, wrote in an emailed statement that “Local 26 employees currently receive highly competitive wages that are among the highest for the local and national workforce for comparable positions in the foodservice industry.”
Unite Here Local 26 is a local union that represents Harvard’s dining services employees.
Gabe G. Hogdkin ’18, a member of the Student Labor Action Movement, said he initially expected a turnout of around 75 people. Participants said they were surprised to see that more than 200 Harvard affiliates attended the march. Some had been notified about the event ahead of time, via Facebook; others passed by the demonstration and decided to join in.
A pair of recently admitted students entered the Yard from the MBTA stop and stood on the fringes of the protest, initially confused, but ultimately encouraged by the event.
“I found it stimulating,” Constance Bourguingnon said. “This is exactly the kind of environment I want to be in.”
The event attracted student groups from across Harvard, notably Reclaim Harvard Law School, the Harvard Medical School Racial Justice Coalition, and the Harvard College Democrats. Other participants included workers from other unions on campus, and even one janitorial worker from Emerson College.
The rally is the latest in a series of events SLAM has hosted since launching their “One Harvard” campaign. Last month, members of SLAM presented University President Drew G. Faust with a letter calling for her to join a “coalition” of groups focused on improving wages and healthcare benefits for dining services employees. Sam Heller ’18, a member of SLAM, said the group also invited Faust to attend the rally, but received notice that Faust was unavailable.
At the center of the debate is an issue that has been especially contentious over the past few years: healthcare. In 2014, the University rolled out a healthcare plan for its non-union employees, which some professors criticized for including copayments and deductibles for non-routine appointments. In response, the University amended that agreement to mitigate the burden on its employees. The most recent contract between the University and its largest employee union did not include deductibles, but instead established a “premium contribution tier” for workers whose salary falls beneath $55,000.
Workers are also pushing to have the term of their employment extended, which goes through the academic year, but not during the summer when the majority of undergraduates are away.
DeLuzuriaga wrote that the administration informed HUDS workers of the “cyclical nature” of their job during the hiring process. “In addition to maintaining their health and other benefits during the breaks, the University also offers these employees the opportunity to attend paid trainings during these periods.” she added.
The contract between the University and HUDS workers is set to expire this June.

Porcellian Club graduate board President Charles M. Storey ’82, who also serves as president of Harpoon Brewery, issued an apology on Harpoon’s website Wednesday for a rare public statement he had sent to The Crimson criticizing the College administration's actions towards final clubs.
Storey’s statement from this Tuesday, which represented the club’s most extensive public comments in its centuries-long existence, kicked off a media frenzy, with many news outlets focusing on Storey’s comments about the relationship between co-ed final clubs and sexual assault.
“Forcing single gender organizations to accept members of the opposite sex could potentially increase, not decrease the potential for sexual misconduct,” Storey wrote.
“In a letter to the Harvard Crimson regarding private clubs of Harvard, I attempted to make a point regarding efforts to address sexual assault on campus. Unfortunately, I chose my words poorly and it came out all wrong,” Storey wrote in his apology. “This failure has led to extreme and unfortunate misinterpretations, which were not my intentions at all.”
Storey’s comments drew immediate and intense criticism from news outlets including Gawker and public figures like U.S. Congresswoman Katherine Clark, who tweeted “Or, instead of blaming women, you could focus on teaching members of your club to NOT sexually assault people,” in reference to Storey’s letter.
Storey’s comments also set off a wave of national media attention, with the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the Boston Globe all publishing stories about the statement.
Although Storey’s comments inspired the most public scrutiny, he was not the only graduate leader of a final club to make a rare public statement this week. Ahead of a Wednesday meeting between Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana and final club leaders, Fly Club graduate board President Richard T. Porteus Jr. ’78 copied The Crimson on an email to College administrators.
In that email, he requested yes or no answers to questions on the College’s plans for final clubs, who have been the subject of intense administrative scrutiny this year over their single-gender policies. In March, a University-wide task force condemned the all-male groups in a sexual misconduct survey.
The meeting, which Khurana said yielded no “final decisions” and was marked by a tense atmosphere, left many attendees frustrated by a lack of specificity from the Dean. Khurana did, however, float a possible sanction should the College pursue disciplinary action against club undergraduates. According to four attendees of the meeting, Khurana suggested that undergraduates involved in all-male social organizations could be disqualified from fellowships and leadership positions on campus. Khurana also again called on clubs to tell him by April 15 whether or not they plan to go co-ed.
After the meeting, Porteus also spoke with the Washington Post, arguing that the College’s actions represented a “change from liberal education to illiberal education.”

Current and post-graduate students in the Law School’s S.J.D. program heard presentations on topics ranging from the promotion of religious freedom abroad, to the limits of territorial jurisdiction at the annual International Legal History Day on Thursday.
The Harvard S.J.D. Association, a group that provides support for students studying for the Law School’s “most advanced law degree,” established International Legal History Day in 2011 as a way of enabling students to discuss research with peers and share their studies.
“International Legal History Day was started to promote the work both of current S.J.D. candidates and of graduates of the S.J.D. program, and to contribute broadly to the intellectual life of the Harvard community,” said S.J.D. candidate Priyasha Saksena, one of the event’s organizers.
In previous years, the day mainly consisted of forums and research workshops, but this year the lineup featured a collection of book talks, paper presentations, and panels held throughout the day.
The slate of events kicked off with a book talk on the mindset of U.S. foreign policy-makers as they promoted religious freedom abroad. Recent S.J.D. graduate Anna Su, who presented at the book talk and co-led the subsequent discussion, argued that America’s promotion of religious freedom was integral in the U.S.’s ascent to global power.
Péter Szigeti, another graduate of the S.J.D. program, presented his own dissertation on the tenuousness of territorial jurisdiction.
“Rather than pretend that physical boundaries can set limits to power, we should acknowledge the already existing reality that states do assert jurisdiction wherever they have interests and have the power,” Szigeti said after his presentation.
Saksena said there was also a book talk on the dual roles international law has played in history; as both a tool of hegemony imposed by the West on the non-West, and as a tool of resistance for non-Western lawyers.
On the whole, participants said the day presented a rare opportunity for scholars in a niche field to gather and discuss contemporary issues, and that they were pleased with the outcome.
“The benefit is to bring together so many committed and thoughtful practitioners working at the intersection of law and history in the same room,” said Faculty of Arts and Sciences History Chair David Armitage, who led a panel on international history methodology. “These conversations give great hope for this field.”
Szigeti emphasized that, while the topics were widespread, they shared one key feature.
“Even though the books and papers presented are on very different issues,” Szigeti said, “how people approach the writing of international legal history is one common thing we would like to emphasize.”

As students prepare to welcome the Class of 2020 on campus for Visitas, Harvard’s weekend for its admitted students, local businesses are likewise gearing up for their arrival.
The Office of Admissions expects over 1,300 prospective freshmen to attend the weekend-long program, which will feature over one hundred events organized by the College. In addition to these events, the Office of Admissions is partnering with the Harvard Square Business Association to hold the first “Harvard Square Street Fair.” The Fair, to be held on Saturday on Winthrop Street, will showcase a wide variety of Square businesses, including restaurants, retailers, service providers, and financial institutions.
Director of Visitas and former Crimson business editor Timothy J. Smith ’08 said he hopes prospective freshmen see that Harvard is a vibrant community and “more than bricks and gates.”
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the HSBA and an organizer of the fair event, said she looks forward to showcasing Square businesses to students and their families.
“Harvard Square is very special, and I think the University really understands the value that the Square brings to the University experience,” Jillson said.
Prospective freshmen will be able to explore the wide offerings of local shops at the fair, where many represented businesses will tout special deals exclusive to prospective students. The Harvard Coop will feature special discounts for prospective students.
Coop President Jerry P. Murphy said the apparel shop gave each admitted student free membership and a Class of 2020 t-shirt. He added that students prefer leaving campus with more Harvard gear.
“Hopefully when they think about coming to Harvard, we can help that process along by having something they will like to identify with, that they can think back to the fun memories of their weekend at Harvard,” Murphy said.
One of many restaurants represented at the fair, El Jefe’s Taqueria, will showcase its food, providing coupons and complimentary snacks. As the restaurant is relatively new to the Square, opening last November, its manager Jon Eller said he is “excited to have more people over, and more people to get to know our business.”
In addition to restaurants and retailers, hotels like the Charles Hotel will also participate in the street fair. Greg S. Bodenlos, brand marketing manager at the Charles, noted that in addition to the actual hotel, the Charles encompasses the Regatta Bar jazz club, Noir, and Henrietta’s Table, locations which he hopes to highlight for prospective freshmen and their families.
Prospective freshman Michael J. Won said he and his family plan to take advantage of the businesses in Harvard Square during Visitas. His parents are staying at the Charles Hotel, for instance.
“I hear that there are some limited edition sales from the Harvard Shop,” Won said. “I plan to buy some apparel.”

The U.S. Secretary of Energy Ernest J. Moniz advocated for the role of science in securing the nuclear deal with Iran during a lecture at the Institute of Politics on Thursday.
Moniz focused particularly on the importance of scientific understanding in diplomacy to “solve humanity’s big issues.” As a physicist, his scientific knowledge and perspective was instrumental to the negotiating of the nuclear deal with Iran, he said.
According to Moniz, his leadership at the Department of Energy has allowed him to leverage scientific understanding when dealing with public policy issues.
“The Department of Energy is fundamentally a science organization,” he said. “It is really about bringing science and technology together on important issues.”
One of the key roles of the Department of Energy is that of maintaining the security of America's nuclear weapons arsenal. Thus, a large part of his role during the negotiations with Iran was to create mechanisms that ensured “Iran substantially roll[ed] back its nuclear enterprise...in return for economic sanctions relief,” Moniz said.
In order for the agreements to be successful, Moniz said it was necessary that a “set of objectives and needs on both sides that [did] not exclude solutions [be found].”
Ultimately, a common desire  for reconciliation by all governments involved resulted in the deal, which includes a “set of unique verification materials” for American benefit, he said.
“We have surveillance by the IAEA of the manufacturing of centrifuge parts for 20 years,” Moniz said, referring to the International Atomic Energy Agency, an international organization that reports to the United Nations, “and we have the first ever surveillance of the Iranian supply channel for 25 years.”
Iran, the European Union, and the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council agreed to an international framework last year to remove heavy international sanctions on Iran in exchange for reforms and monitoring of the country’s nuclear energy program. Countries including the U.S. initially placed sanctions following concerns that Iran’s uranium enrichment program could allow it to develop a nuclear weapon.
Graham T. Allison, the director of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at the Kennedy School and the event moderator, praised Moniz’s commitment to the negotiations with Iran.
“What if no agreement had been reached? What would we have been talking about today?” Allison asked. “It would be most likely about [a] third war in the Middle East.”
Several student attendees said they found Moniz’s work inspiring.
“I study engineering here at Harvard, and I’ve done about seven years of energy research, so that’s why this is something that I really care about,” Eesha Khare ’17 said. “And so Ernest Moniz is someone who is such an inspiring person for me.”
Mohammadreza Jalaeipour, a postdoctoral fellow, said he appreciated Moniz’s work, noting also the importance of the years of behind-the-scenes diplomatic work that was required to build up a workable relationship with the Iranian government.
“Moniz really benefited from the work of his predecessors and the rapport they built up with the Iranians was crucial [to the deal],” he said.

Award season is in full swing at Harvard. In addition to the usual slate of Fulbright and Rhodes scholars, this spring will bring with it a new set of prizes for freshmen, along with a cohort of advising award winners announced Thursday.
Dean of Freshmen and interim Dean of Student Life Thomas A. Dingman ’67 announced the creation of the four new awards in an email on Thursday, inviting first-year students to nominate their classmates for the new prizes. The impetus for these awards came out of a desire to recognize freshmen for their achievements outside of the classroom, Dingman said.
“We have an award each year for the person who’s had across-the-board academic success,” Dingman said, referring to the Jacob Wendell Scholarship Prize, which is awarded based on academic performance during the freshman year. “The more we’ve thought about it, the more we’ve said, why don’t we have a chance to honor those freshmen who demonstrate the values that are near and dear to us?”
The awards include prizes for public service, creativity in the arts, and commitment to community, along with a “Deans’ Award” for the student who “most adheres to the spirit of the freshman deans.”
“The spirit behind this initiative was to make clear the values that are foremost in our minds,” Dingman said. “This is something that the FDO cares enough about to create awards around.”
The FDO will be accepting nominations online through April 22, Dingman said, at which point he and a yet-unnamed panel will judge them. Dingman said he hoped that the winners would be announced before the end of the academic year.
Students are not the only ones to receive awards, however. On Thursday, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana announced in an email the 12 winners of the Star awards for advising, who will be honored at an expanded award ceremony in May.
The awards recognize freshman and sophomore advisers, along with concentration advisers and faculty members, who offer informal guidance or thesis advising to undergraduates. The Undergraduate Council solicited nominations for these awards from students in February.
Glenn R. Magid, director of the Advising Programs Office, said he was very pleased with this year’s group of advisers.
“I feel perfect about the batch of winners,” Magid said. “I think it’s an extremely distinguished bunch of advisers.”
Magid praised the vetting process that the prize nominees underwent, noting that applications for potential prize winners went before a wide panel of readers.
“It’s a selection process with tremendous integrity that draws on a mix of students, past winners, staff, and resident deans of freshmen,” Magid said. “The people who do the judging are very familiar with this type of advising.”

UPDATED: April 15, 2016, at 12:48 p.m.
Undergraduates interested in analyzing athletics data need look no further than Harvard Yard, where the College’s only sports analytics student group meets weekly to discuss unnoticed trends across the sports world.
Over the past several years, Harvard’s Sports Analysis Collective has grown in visibility, thanks in large part to a football prediction that went viral and a favorable reputation among professional athletic organizations and writers.
The group, which meets every Tuesday night, collects vast amounts of data across all sports and levels of competition and uses advanced statistics and computer science to formulate their analyses, publishing reports and predictions to their website. Their members have gone onto reputable careers;  one, Jason W. Rosenfeld ’12, is now the director of  analytics for the National Basketball Association.
For many in the group, sports analytics provides an opportunity to continue involvement in upper level athletics, Kurt T. Bullard ’17, the group’s treasurer said.
“Harvard is the place to go if you want to go into sports analytics,” Bullard, who is also a Crimson sports editor, said. “I’m not gonna be an athlete, so this is a way I’d work for a team. It’s sort of a dream job for me.”
According to Brendan J. Kent ’18, HSAC’s secretary who focuses primarily on soccer analysis, each member can research the sport or topic that interests him most. Kent himself began working part-time for the Portland Timbers, a Major League Soccer team, because the team reached out to him after viewing his work for HSAC.
“I’ve done research on travel in the MLS and the effect on that for players and some stuff on Champions league and the value of one-seeds,” Kent said.
Kent is far from the only member garnering attention for his research.  Nearly all of the members are seriously considering sports analytics as a career, he said, and the club has also become a prime recruiting pool for professional sports teams.
“A really valuable component of the club is that you have the ability to build a portfolio, but also hone your skills, so when you’re looking at real jobs you have some solid work on what’s become a pretty respected website,” Kent said.
Adam W. Gilfix ’17, the club’s co-president who focuses mainly on baseball, has written several analysis pieces for the  Washington Post. The club has provided him and other members the opportunity to network with professionals, he said, noting that they attended the MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference last month.
“They had plenty of people from ESPN, the Washington Post, various sports teams, whether from the front office or players and coaches,” Gilfix said. “It was also an amazing networking opportunity. We got to meet people who we watch on TV and read about everyday.”
Much outside interest comes from the group’s website, which has grown a sizeable viewership over past years, according to Gilfix.
“Recently, we’ve been getting on average 400 to 700 views on our blog per day,” Gilfix said.  “We’ve seen quite a few days with 1,000 or 2,000 views, but also a handful of days with 30,000 views or more.”
Some of HSAC’s articles have gone viral, including a Miami Dolphins 2015 playoff prediction from Bullard. Gilfix said the post received more than 100,000 total views and has surpassed the HSAC homepage as their most viewed page.
“I checked Facebook that afternoon, and at that point I believe it was trending,” Gilfix added. “When I saw that it was written about on NFL.com along with some other sites, I realized this was a big deal.”
Bullard was interviewed on ESPN Miami, Fox Sports, and CBS Sports, and attributed the attention his prediction received to various factors, including the “Harvard” name, the time of year, and the Dolphins multi-year playoff drought prior to the 2015 season, which made the prediction seem highly unlikely.
“It was sort of the perfect storm,” Bullard said. “It was late July and NFL writers were looking for things to write about because they need to publish content.”
The Dolphins did not end up in the playoffs, but Bullard said he still believes in his approach, which used approximate value statistics for each team’s primary offensive and defensive players.
Additionally, members in the club have multiple ongoing partnerships with news outlets and professional sports teams, and the club itself is partnered with the Boston Celtics.
The group primarily helps the Celtics collect and organize “SportVU” data, advanced player tracking data that follows the actions of each individual player during a given game, Kent said.
“A group of 20 or so members of our club alternate going to Celtics games, and we essentially run that system and man the computers there,” Kent said. “We get four tickets usually to every home game and access to the press buffet. I think it’s an awesome deal.”
Despite the group’s reputation within the world of professional sports, they enjoy only limited popularity within the Harvard community, Kent said.
“We joke that HSAC is more well known in the sports community than it is in the Harvard community,” Kent said. “I meet a lot of people here that have no idea what we do, but plenty of executives from professional teams know about us.”

The Boston Redevelopment Authority, the city's urban planning body, unanimously voted to approve Harvard’s proposed $1 billion science and engineering complex on Thursday, nearly a decade after the agency gave its approval to the University’s first iteration of the building in 2007.
The excitement felt by both Harvard representatives and BRA officials about the vote was palpable at the BRA’s board of directors meeting on Thursday night.
“This is an exciting night,” BRA senior project manager Gerald Autler said before beginning his presentation to the board. “So exciting I could sing, but I won’t.”
The six-story science complex, designed by the Boston office of German architectural firm Behnisch Architekten, will feature classrooms, laboratories, and 70,000 square feet of public green space. Construction is slated to start again this summer, six years after Harvard halted construction on the complex due to the 2009 financial crisis, Harvard’s Associate Vice President for Public Affairs and Communications Kevin Casey told the Boston Globe. 
“The Science and Engineering Complex is a state-of-the-art facility that will enhance partnership across academic disciplines and encourage connections among the University, the community, and new partners in industry and research,” University President Drew G. Faust said in a press release.
SEAS Dean Francis J. Doyle III termed the building “one of the world’s most advanced science and engineering facilities” in the press release and said the BRA’s official approval represents an “exciting milestone” for both Harvard and SEAS.
At the meeting, Casey, who presented on behalf of the University, said he was “thrilled to be before [the board] tonight with this project.”
In his speech, Casey emphasized what he said were the potential benefits of locating SEAS faculty within a few minutes’ walk of the Harvard Business School. Harvard plans to relocate roughly two thirds of the faculty of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences to the nearly 500,000-square foot building when it opens in 2020.
“This is a group [that is] looking to do things and push boundaries that have never been done before,” Casey said of the SEAS faculty. “To locate this kind of innovative faculty across from the entrepreneurial faculty of HBS, we think will create a gravitational pull that will attract investors for the ideas that are coming out of here.”
Though the motion to approve Harvard’s science complex passed unanimously, BRA board member Theodore C. Landsmark raised concerns over the methods and metrics of Harvard’s contributions to the City of Boston. He urged Harvard to “think beyond” Boston’s “payment in lieu of taxes” program, which calls for voluntary payments from nonprofit organizations that have at least $15 million worth of property.
“In one of our earlier approvals tonight, we saw significant financial investment coming from our unions towards the creation of affordable housing,” he said. “So it’s not as though there aren’t precedents for other ways that Harvard can use its resources to address certain pressing needs within the city.”
At the meeting, the BRA board also voted to approve Harvard’s Soldiers Field Park graduate housing renovation project, an interior renewal of the existing four-building housing complex scheduled to take place over the next four years.

Last February, the Undergraduate Council published all of its Finance Committee’s grant allocations dating back to the fall of 2011 in an effort to improve communication between the body and undergraduates. The public data includes information about which student organizations requested funding, how much they requested, and how much the Finance Committee chose to allocate.
This semester in particular, the UC  has come under the microscope for its funding policies and ability to regulate attendance at events that receive grant money.
In theory, most undergraduates at Harvard have a stake in UC funding policies. To finance student events, the College requests undergraduates pay a $75 UC Activities fee each academic year. Here is where their money goes.
The majority of the UC’s budget, financed by the activities fee,  goes towards the General Grants Allocation, a fund the Finance Committee then distributes to student organizations. The UC also provides $6,000 per semester to each of 12 House Committees, and uses $21,500 in funds on the Council’s committees—which goes towards initiatives including publicity, Datamatch, and food for student events.

Food, club sports, and travel account for the majority of the funding from the UC Finance Committee so far this semester. Student organizations may receive $2 to $4 per person for food and $4.50 per person for travel, while club sports may receive a maximum of $2,000 in total funding each semester. Because the committee has gone over budget in recent weeks, it has cut weekly funding in amounts ranging from 6.6 percent to 29.5 percent.
The Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club has received more money from the UC than any other student organization in the past five years, prompting the Finance Committee to pass a controversial policy capping funding to theater organizations earlier this semester.

In fact, during three of the past four academic years, the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club received the most funding of all campus student groups. The Chinese Students Association has been in the top 5 grant-receiving clubs for the past four years, while the South Asian Association has been in the top 5 for the three of the past four years. The top 20 percent of grant-receiving organizations are required to have members undergo sexual assault prevention training, according to a new policy the committee passed this semester.

During the 2014-2015 academic year, student organizations requested less funding from the UC than any other year on record. Over the course of the year, student organizations requested $470,599, a decline of more than 25 percent compared to the year before.
A Note on How Data was Calculated
The total budget distribution is based on the UC’s “Continuing Resolution Concerning the FY16 UC Budget” passed on Sept. 20, 2015. The data on top clubs funded, total money requests, and grant allocations is taken from the “Undergraduate Council Master Grants Spreadsheet,” made available by the UC in February. The distribution of UC grants was also taken from the master grants spreadsheet for the first eight weeks of the Spring 2016, with the following modifications: some of the values labeled “Other” were re-categorized based on the labels provided on the spreadsheet, and theater and performance group funding was separated into its own category. Note that the distribution of UC grants money is approximate—depending on how various expenses are classified, numbers may vary.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 17, 2016, at 3:35 p.m.
Standing in front of the inaugural class of Harvard Teacher Fellows, Sarah R. Leibel, a lecturer at the Harvard Graduate School of Education and Master Teacher for the Teacher Fellows program, shared a personal poem biography in the style of George Ella Lyon’s “Where I’m From.” Touching on topics ranging from teachers who were important to her growing up to the various languages spoken in her family, she said her goal was to make the Fellows feel more comfortable with sharing their own experiences during their classes.
Later, the Fellows drafted and read their own poems to the rest of the class. Leibel said this was just one example of the many exercises her and other lecturers in the program have implemented to build camaraderie among the Fellows and better prepare them for the challenge that lies ahead: teaching in high-need public urban schools.
The Harvard Teacher Fellows program, a teacher training initiative centered at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, prepares aspiring educators to teach in under-resourced urban schools. The program recently selected its inaugural cohort of 20 fellows.
Already enrolled in a teaching methods course at the Graduate School of Education, these Fellows are in the midst of a multi-year process of intensive training to become teachers. While they come from a diverse range of backgrounds, many attribute a combination of a passion for education and social justice as motivating factors for becoming a teacher and choosing Harvard’s program over others.
LEAVING A LASTING IMPACT
For some Fellows, positive experiences with teachers motivated their joining the program. Several Fellows commented on the impact they hope to have as role models to their students, as well as the importance of recognizing the unique experiences that have shaped them.
For Rebecca V. Park ’16, teaching and education are fields she has been immersed in from a young age. Her parents and several of her extended family members are all teachers. Park also worked as a counselor at a youth summer camp based in New Hampshire for several years, citing that as another experience that has influenced her interest in education.
“I definitely was raised to value and appreciate teachers, and see how hard they work... [and] how rewarding it can be,” she said. “I think definitely coming from there, having that background, was a big part of being attracted to teaching and understanding what it looks like.”
Grace Kossia ’16 said that since she immigrated to the United States from the Democratic Republic of the Congo with her family at a young age, her family has faced a number of challenges that made it difficult to find stability. However, she said her experience at school with teachers who showed they cared helped to improve significantly her experience in the U.S.
“I could really pick out the teachers who were really there for us… They just poured in a lot of extra effort that they probably weren’t getting paid for,” Kossia said.
Reflecting on her own experience, Kossia said she struggled with courses in her mechanical engineering concentration, but chose to continue nevertheless. She said she hopes to use this experience as a woman of color in science and math as a motivation for her students to succeed in these fields.
“I think I also continued with engineering just to prove that as a minority female, I could do it,” Kossia said, “And that’s what I want to impart my students with: with the notion that they can do something if they put their mind to it.”
A KNACK FOR TEACHING IN COLLEGE
For other Fellows, experiences in college led them to pursue the program as a way to contribute to society.
When Quan C. Le ’15 entered college, he started on the pre-med track with the intention of gaining experience with research and working in a hospital environment during his undergraduate years. However, his interest in working with youth led to extensive involvement in several Phillips Brooks House Association programs.
Over three summers and multiple semesters at Harvard, Le worked with children from high-trauma populations, including refugees, domestic violence survivors, and immigrants. He said these programs motivated him to enter the teaching profession as opposed to medical school.
“I ended up spending all my summers and extracurriculars doing tutoring work, something I actually enjoyed. I never got into research or in a hospital to know what it’s actually like to be a doctor,” he said.
Le attributes his upbringing as a son of immigrant parents in a low-income household as influencing his decision to serve underprivileged youth as a profession. He said he hopes to inspire his students in the classroom, who will often come from low-income backgrounds.
“Not only is it meaningful for me to be able to help people that come from similar backgrounds, but I can also serve as a role model for them,” he said.
For Park, her concentration in history and literature has influenced the way she plans to teach, in part through bringing attention to the stories of historically underrepresented groups.
“Having [history and literature] has both further reinforced the importance of the social justice aspect of history and also really prepared me for the content knowledge to teach,” she said.
Jing Qiu ’16 said she similarly decided to become a teacher while doing public service work in college. She said her family has always seen education as the gateway to opportunity.
Having attended a private school her entire life, she said she was troubled by the disparity in opportunities she was given compared to her peers attending public schools in the same area.
“From a very young age, I saw that dichotomy and it was very jarring. I knew from middle school onward that I wanted to do something public service related, something addressing education and equality,” she said.
While participating in and leading a number of PBHA programs during her summers and term-time at Harvard, Qiu discovered her passion for mentoring students and working in youth development.
Jonathan D. Young ’16 said he finds teaching to be one of the best ways for him to combat educational inequity. “For me, it’s more about...the inequality that one can fix and one can start to overcome through the means of teaching,” he said.
Leibel said she was impressed by the insight and humility that the Fellows have about entering the field and their potential students.
“I think sometimes…there’s a perception that Ivy League college students are just thinking they know it all and they are going to go in there and get it right, and I think that’s really not the case with our Fellows,” Leibel said. “I think our students are really looking to enter their practice from a place of what can I learn, how can I serve, how can I do better?”
WEIGHING THE OPTIONS
Out of the teaching programs they considered, some Fellows cited intensive training and the possibility for better impact on urban schools as factors that attracted them to the Harvard Teacher Fellows program over others.
Young said the program best helps him achieve his longer term goals of impacting education reform and educational entrepreneurship. He said he is looking forward to participating in a new program where the inaugural class will have a large voice in how it develops over the years.
“It’s very exciting to be a part of something that’s growing… to have the potential to play a real role in how it grows,” he said.
Evan B. Weiner ’16 said he chose the program partially for the amount of preparation it provides with the goal of gradually easing Fellows into full-time teaching.
Weiner said he appreciated how Fellows are assigned half the normal load of courses in their first year of teaching, which he hopes will allow him to reflect and focus on the experience, instead of being preoccupied with a busy teaching schedule.
“At each step along the way you have the space to reflect and get advice and improve, and not be so invested and busy with everyday teaching stuff,” Weiner said.
Le echoed Weiner’s sentiments.
“You’re able to expend more energy actually making sure that those classes are well running and kids are getting something out of them,” Le said.
In addition, Weiner noted that in his experience, the urban public schools he has worked with through the program have had passionate teachers and administrators with a strong sense of purpose.
“Throughout the year there’s a lot of coaching, feedback, constructive criticism and observation, that is very atypical of a lot of public schools, especially urban high needs schools, but it’s true of the schools we’re partnered with,” he said. “I think HTF, more than any other teacher program that I could see, was a program that could give me the support and training.”
Kapena Baptista ’16 said he was impressed by how “intentional and robust” the program seemed in terms of preparing its members for the teaching profession, especially when compared with Teach for America.
“I know a lot of the criticisms that revolve around other alternative teacher licensure programs, like [Teach for America], is that they don’t teach their teachers enough… that you only go to your camps for about five or six weeks, and then they throw you into the roughest neighborhoods in the roughest towns,” he said. “So teachers go in fairly unprepared, and that’s something that HTF I think is aware that happens, and is something that they’re trying to mitigate.”
However, Teach for America recruitment manager Bryan Sohn characterized their program’s approach as “rigorous,” despite its shorter timeframe.
“We believe in a shorter on-ramp to impact, knowing the challenges that students in classrooms face today,” he wrote in an email. “We also know that many students are eager to make an immediate impact, with lots of coaching and hands-on learning along the way.”
LOOKING AHEAD
Despite the diverse reasons for having picked the program, Fellows and administrators alike say they have forged tight-knit bonds during the training process.
“We’ve only known each other for two months but I already feel very comfortable with everyone in the program and the faculty,” Qiu said. “The faculty are very receptive to our feedback and it’s very much like we’re doing this together and this is something that we’re working together on, and that’s amazing.”
Weiner said he expects to become closer with other participants as the program continues post-graduation.
“The group is phenomenally supportive,” he said. “This isn’t something I knew going in, but it’s just a wonderful group of students and faculty who I feel very close to already and that’ll only get more intense as time goes on.”
Eric H. Shed, director of the Harvard Teacher Fellows program, said he looks forward to the next few years with the Fellows.
“I couldn’t be more confident about any group’s success, even given the daunting challenge of teaching,” Shed said. “I’m nothing but excited.”

Harvard men’s volleyball belongs to the EIVA, an eight-team conference that stretches from a southeastern extreme in Charleston, W.Va., to a northwestern tip in Cambridge, Mass.
In the regular season, all teams play each other twice. By themselves these matches matter little—win all 14 contests, and you get justifiable pride but not much else.
However, the two-month conference gauntlet builds up to something that truly does matter: a playoff berth. Every year, the top four EIVA teams convene for a season-deciding tournament, and the winner of that joust heads to the NCAA tournament.
Naturally, the Crimson understands this procedure. Haunted by a pair of losses last weekend, now tied for fourth with the New Jersey Institute of Technology, Harvard (11-10, 7-5) enters weekend matchups against Princeton (3-9, 3-17) and the Highlanders of NJIT (8-16, 7-5) with the possibility of either clinching a playoff spot or seeing its season end in disappointing fashion on its home court.
Put another away: It all comes down to this.
“It’s definitely stressful considering the fact that all three of my years here, we’ve made it to the conference tournament,” captain Branden Clemens said. “But I think we realize that, and there’s a sense of urgency in that we need to really be on top of our game this weekend.”
The stakes loom especially large for outside hitter Clemens, outside hitter Alec Schlossman, and libero Alister Bent, the three seniors on this year’s team. Friday’s matchup against the Tigers marks Senior Night, and a smattering of alumni will be on hand to watch the competition.
But the more hyped contest arrives the following afternoon, when the Crimson squares off against NJIT, the other program tied for fourth. Depending on other results, the contest could be the last match of the season for either team.
“Everyone’s focused,” Schlossman said. “We know we’re not guaranteed a playoff spot…. We just need to treat it like any other week.”
After six weeks of competition, the EIVA remains a muddled picture. At 11-1 in the conference, Penn State occupies the top spot, but no other team has clinched a playoff berth. Besides Harvard and the Highlanders, two 8-4 teams—St. Francis and George Mason—are also fighting for survival.
Playoff scenarios are sufficiently complicated to require the use of a spreadsheet. For now, the EIVA’s top five teams control their own destiny. Win out, and they are guaranteed a tournament berth.
In the Crimson’s case, splitting the weekend would force the team to rely on other factors—most likely a poor performance by George Mason—to squeak into the playoffs. Meanwhile, dropping both contests would unequivocally end the season.
Harvard players would like to foreclose that second possibility Friday night with a victory over Princeton. In late February, the Crimson swept the Tigers in New Jersey, and the season has not improved much for Princeton since then.
A year after making the playoffs, the Tigers enter this weekend riding a nine-match losing streak and stuck in seventh place. On the season, opponents have outhit Princeton .310 to .214, and no Tiger ranks in the top five in the conference in any major statistical category.
“I don’t try to think too far ahead,” Schlossman said. “We have Princeton on Friday, so that’s our main focus.”
NJIT has shown more life, rebounding from an 0-10 start to the season to launch a six-match winning streak in March and climb into playoff contention.
Most of the team’s offense flows through junior outside hitter Jabarry Goodridge, who has matured into perhaps the top threat in the EIVA. A slender 6’4”, the Barbados native has posted a remarkable 4.44 kills per set, best in the conference, and ranks second in kill rate at .317.
In the Highlanders’ first matchup against Harvard—which the Crimson lost in five sets—Goodridge racked up 20 finishes, albeit on 47 attacks.
But Harvard will counter fire with fire by trotting out Clemens, who has reached double-digit kill totals in 17 of the team’s 21 matches. The captain boasts a powerful jump serve and has hit .311 on the year.
More than personnel, the Crimson has the advantage of location, as both matchups will take place beneath the familiar lighting of the Malkin Athletic Center. That visual factor, combined with the emotional effect of a home crowd, promises to boost Harvard.
But in many ways, uncertainty remains. It is a satisfying fact of sports in general, and men’s volleyball in particular, that by this end of the weekend, a four-team lineup will have eradicated any doubts.
“It’s crazy how it’s fully coming to an end,” Clemens said. “For me, these two games could potentially be my last, so I’m ready to give it everything I have.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Building upon a five-game winning streak, the Harvard softball team exploded for 10 runs for the third consecutive contest Thursday afternoon, defeating the University of Maine, 10-7, at Soldiers Field.
The matchup was initially scheduled as a double-header this past Tuesday, but due to inclement weather forecasted in Boston for that day, the games were postponed and reduced to a single game. Nevertheless, two extra days of inaction could not slow the Crimson offense.
“It was a good, home, mid-week nonconference game to get working,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said. “We got a lot of players in the game, and I thought that some of our players really stepped up and did a good job.”
Harvard (17-13, 6-2 Ivy) got off to a quick start, scoring eight runs in the first three innings, with the Black Bears (15-14, 4-1 America East) only plating two. Freshman third baseman Meagan Lantz went 2-for-3 at the plate in the first few innings, including a two-run home run in the first and a single that resulted in two runs in the third.
By the end of the day, Lantz had driven in a total of 5 runs and scored one herself.
“We just really got out there and were very aggressive on offense,” Lantz said. “Everybody was really swinging the bat well and owning the zone. We especially did well not going for the pitches that were outside the zone, so we just really attacked the plate.”
In the top of the fourth, however, the tide seemed to be turning in the visitors’ favor. Maine scored five runs on five hits in the frame, bringing the Black Bears within one run, 8-7.
Normally a relief pitcher, freshman Sarah Smith started on the mound for Harvard, but the rookie appeared to be getting tired by the end of the fourth inning. After a pitching change that saw junior Taylor Cabe take over for Smith, the Crimson managed to finally close out the top of the inning.
“Today, we wanted to give everyone rest and didn’t want to overtax our pitchers,” Allard said.  “We’re thin behind the plate and thin at short, so we didn’t want these players to get overly tired with the big weekend coming up.”
The Harvard offense failed to score any runs in the bottom of the fourth to counter Maine’s rally. But with the Crimson still up by one, Cabe showed no indication of allowing the close lead to slip. In the top of the fifth, she let up only one hit before quickly striking out two batters, then getting another to ground out to third.
Back on the offensive end, Harvard managed to close out the fifth inning up two. Freshman Kaitlyn Schiffhauer lined an RBI base hit into center field, widening the gap to 9-7.
The Crimson defense again staved off Maine in the top of the sixth. Only one hitter got on base on account of a fielding error, advancing to second before Cabe quickly retired the next two Black Bears on a ground out and a pop fly to come away unscathed.
Again, the Harvard squad opened up its lead in the bottom of the inning, tallying another run on the board. Sophomore Dallas Hogan, pinch running for junior Catherine Callaway, stole second before getting to third and then home plate on a sacrifice bunt and a grounder to second, respectively.
Entering the top of the seventh, the Crimson sought to finish the job without taking another turn at bat. In fact, it did just that, only letting up one hit and holding its 10-7 lead. In total, Cabe went 3.2 innings in relief, allowing one run and striking out five.
“I think the team’s just been having a really good season so far, and it’s been really successful overall,” Lantz said. “We just need to carry that success through this weekend and into the rest of this season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After earning an important 12-8 win over Cornell last weekend in Ithaca, N.Y., the Harvard men’s lacrosse team (6-5, 2-1 Ivy) will stay on the road as it travels to Philadelphia for a Saturday afternoon showdown with Penn (5-5, 2-2).
Against the Big Red, the Crimson offense came together in the second half to turn a one-goal advantage at halftime into a comfortable victory. The win over Cornell marked Harvard’s first road win in Ivy play in almost two years, and the team now hopes to replicate its successful performance against the Quakers.
“Penn is a very good team; they beat us the last three [meetings],” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “This is a team and a program we have a tremendous amount of respect for. We’re going to have to play very well on Saturday to be successful.”
Though the Crimson has suffered three consecutive losses against the Quakers, the final margin in all three games was less than two goals. This year’s edition of the contest will likely be competitive once again, and important for both teams, in terms of not only placement in the standings but also for the sake of gaining momentum for the end of the regular season.
Penn, in particular, will hope to get back on track with a win over Harvard. The Quakers are on a three-game losing streak, with all three losses coming against top-10 teams. Its most recent defeat was a 17-6 blowout at the hands of No. 4 Brown.
Despite Penn’s three game losing streak, the Crimson is not taking its opponent lightly.
“They’re a really good team; our senior class hasn’t beaten them during our time here,” Harvard co-captain and midfielder Sean Mahon said. “We know it’s going to be a battle, but we’re confident and ready for it.”
The Crimson will be playing close attention to Quaker senior attacker Nick Doktor. Doktor, a four-year starter at Penn who was named second-team All-Ivy last season, is the team’s points leader with 39 on the year. Twenty-eight of those points come from assists, placing Doktor in a tie for second in the nation in that category. With his ability to create opportunities for his teammates, Doktor will likely pose a major challenge for Harvard’s defense.
To counter, the Crimson will rely on the performances of defenders like Bobby Duvnjak, who ranks first in the nation in caused turnovers with 2.45 per game. He and the rest of the Harvard defensive unit will have to be on top of their game to limit the Penn offense.
“We’ll try a variety of things defensively on Doktor,” Wojcik said. “But to defend any team, we play a team defensive system to stop him and the rest of the team.”
The Crimson has an offensive threat of its own in senior attacker Devin Dwyer. A preseason first-team All-NEILA honoree as well as a preseason All-American, Dwyer has lived up to the expectations thus far, as he enters the weekend tied for third in the nation in points per game with 4.91.
The Garden City, N.Y., native has already set a career-high with 30 goals this season, and has added 24 assists as well, the latter of which ranks tied for sixth in the country. Dating back to his freshman year, Dwyer is also on a 44-game point streak, the fifth-longest active streak in the country.
Harvard, this season, has done better than Penn in nearly every offensive statistical category, including goals per game (11.27 to 10.60) and assists per game (7.27 to 6.70). With Penn faring better in faceoffs, however, winning 43.0 percent of its battles at the X to the Crimson’s 36.8 percent, gaining possession of the ball to begin with will likely remain a challenge for Harvard.
Even with these stats to ponder and revenge in the back of their minds—the Crimson has not won at Penn since 2006—Harvard still approaches this game with the same mentality that it does in any other.
“Obviously you want to beat every team you play,” Mahon said. “It’s more about this season than anything that has happened in the past. Maybe it’s in the back of some guy’s minds, and we really want to get it for the team this year.”
If the Crimson does in fact get it, Saturday afternoon would mark Harvard’s first victory on the road at Penn since 2006.

It’s mid-April, and do you know what that means? Yes, you will soon have to walk into your final exams, woefully unprepared for the horror that awaits you. And yes, you will wonder whether it’s too late to refine your competitive eating skills so you can make that your profession because Applied Math probably isn’t going to work out after all (sorry Mom and Dad.) But before that catastrophe, you get to experience formal season. Whether this is your first formal season or you just never really got the hang of it, here are some do’s and dont’s you should live by.
WHAT (NOT) TO WEAR
DO: Dress nicely. After all, this is a formal event, not an “I woke up at 10:15 for my 10:00 class, and I’m late even with Harvard Time” situation. Wear something that expresses you.
DON’T: Feel like you have to spend a lot of money on a brand new outfit. Everyone is there to have fun and no one is judging you based on what you’re wearing (Read: No one will remember what you wore).
DO: Wear something you’re comfortable jumping around in. You’re not going to have any fun if you can’t get your groove on.
DON’T:  Wear anything you’ll start to regret once you’re surrounded by approximately 268 of your classmates in an enclosed area.
ASKING SOMEONE TO GO WITH YOU #HarvardNetworking
DO: Ask someone if you want to. Just text them or ask them next time you hang out. If they say no, you can still carry on in a normal friendship with that person (I know, shocker).
DON’T: Feel like by asking this person to formal, you are extending your hand in marriage. It’s completely acceptable to just take someone as a friend.
DO: Know that it’s okay to go by yourself or in a large group too. If you feel you’re an independent person who don’t need no date, you do you.
DON’T: Stage an elaborate ‘Promposal’ style situation to ask your date out if you don’t know he/she will say yes for sure. Save yourself potential embarrassment and be chill when you ask someone who’s response you are unsure of.
LOGISTICS (AKA HOW TO MAKE SURE YOUR BAD DECISIONS DON’T DOOM YOU)
DO: Buy your tickets early (Especially Freshmen!) Tickets can run out quickly, and you don’t want to miss out on formal just because you procrastinated too hard.
DON’T: Pregame so hard you can’t even remember getting to the formal. It’s no fun if you’re the kid that passes out before you even start dancing.
DO: Look for policies concerning guests and/or deals because they might be different at every formal. Exhibit A: Kirkland gave out a free vintage Housing Day t-shirt with every ticket purchase last year.
DON’T: Pull a freshman class of 2017. If you do, Harvard might just decide it’s not worth it to have formals, and what would we do then?

Hello, Harvard. It’s your two favorite advice gurus back at it again, Betty and Hyemi. Last week, we asked you to submit your burning life questions to us (which you can still do here), and now we’re here to answer them. We’ve done some deep and introspective soul-searching and came to the conclusion that being part-time advice columnists is our calling in life, so we hope you appreciate our wisdom.
Am I hooking up with too many people?Hyemi: This seems like one of those questions where you want to hear the answer “no” for affirmation, so no, you are not hooking up with too many people! But in all seriousness, maybe you can ask yourself these questions for evaluative purposes: Am I spending too much time hooking up with people and not enough quality time with friends? How many “productive” nights in Lamont did I forgo to have #pillowtalk with my hook up buddies? Is the pillow talk with some of my hook up buddies even good? Alternatively, you could just go with the good old-fashioned “whatever” and not question your ways since the semester is coming to an end anyway.¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Betty: If you have to question whether you’re hooking up with too many people, you’re probably hooking up with too many people. But no judgement, I respect the hustle.
 How do I ask a guy to any of the formals coming up?Hyemi: I would personally go with a cute little text message followed by a string of seemingly-related emojis to make it look low stakes.Betty: When in doubt, Bumble it out. Everyone loves being asked to formals, and if for some reason your Bumble boo says no, it just wasn’t meant to bee...
How should you act around a guy you’ve hooked up with once but haven’t spoken to since? :/Betty: As the wise Henry David Thoreau (Harvard College Class of 1837) once said, “Be yourself—not your idea of what you think somebody else's idea of yourself should be.” In other words, the only person you should be around this guy is the very best person you are: ~yourself~ :]. And if you haven’t spoken since your hookup, is it because this guy hasn’t responded to you yet, or is it because you’re waiting for him to make the next move? Because if it’s the latter, stop waiting. Be proactive and get the ball rolling again. Text him, insta dm him, poke him, challenge him to a game of Facebook basketball. But all the while, act like nothing or nobody but your beautifully unique self.
Hyemi: Thanks for the emoji, really conveys the ~confusion~ and ~frustration~ of our generation’s hook up culture :/. Being that I am an intrinsically awkward person (ex. I get social anxiety when someone is holding the door into Sever for the person in front of me and I don’t know whether I should run to catch up or purposely walk slower so I open the door myself), I would have major hesitations reaching out to him first. If you’re like me and appreciate the low-risk approaches, maybe you can start with a like on his Instagram or Facebook post as a “hello, I remember you and am acknowledging your existence so I hope you appreciate this gesture.” From there, it could build up to prolonged eye contact followed by a smile if you happen to cross paths with him at the fateful Science Center Plaza between classes. Good luck, and please report back to me because if you couldn’t tell, I am personally invested in this now!
Neopets?Betty: Honestly, I was always a Webkinz kind of girl. Come to think of it, I actually made myself a new Webkinz account one fine day in Lamont last semester while “studying for finals.” Pro-tip: you don’t have to purchase a Webkinz plush from your nearest pharmacy anymore to make an account!
Hyemi: Yes, always. The highlights of my Neopets career were playing Meerca Chase and decorating my Neohome with trendy furniture. A major low point was when the evil ghost would steal my Neopet money– seriously, not nice!
That’s our advice for this week, but please continue to tell us your life problems and ponderings and you bet we’ll be back with solutions.
XOXO,
Betty and Hyemi

Visitas, Harvard’s annual pre-freshman visit weekend, comes only once a year. If you’re not a jaded upperclassman, this weekend represents an important time to showcase the fun side of Harvard, proving to young high school students that this place is more than its midterm season. But on the other end, visiting pre-freshman have big questions on their minds - will I fit in here? Is Harvard ~right~? If you’re in that boat, this post is for you.
Many freshmen that visit claim to be worried about whether or not they’ll be able to compete academically on this campus. Whether or not this is actually a guise for name-dropping other options like Stanford, Princeton, or Yale is unclear, but it’s important to know that Harvard students primarily like to compete on how little work they’ve done on the problem set due the next day or how screwed they are for their next exam, rather than for levels of success. So during Visitas, spend less time asking people about classes and more time asking people about their favorite other people on this campus. That’s what actually matters – you’ll probably have an A- average anyways.
Don’t blackout this weekend. We know, we know, you’re so excited to be experiencing college and final clubs are the best thing to happen to anyone ever. It’s not that your reputation of being that kid who couldn’t handle himself this weekend will last – we know that this can easily be accomplished through incessant Facebook posts instead. Rather, too many a young pre-frosh has wasted his four years of work in high school by getting too drunk at Visitas and ending the weekend with a rescinded letter of acceptance from Harvard. You’ve seen a movie about teenage drinking before, so take shots of water and let the placebo effect carry your night away. You also aren’t a student here so the Amnesty Policy, though it’s another good reason to commit, doesn’t count for you yet.
At the end of the day, Visitas is really all about meeting friends who will become your lifelong partners-in-crime and who will speak at your wedding. Indeed, for an entire week of freshman year, countless students consider meeting up with their BFFs from Visitas before abandoning the notion and making friends with other people instead. But believing that you’ve found your crew and then realizing you’ll never speak to them is one of the most important parts of the Visitas experience - try to make sure you don’t miss out on the fun.
