After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Balance—that’s a word Harvard coach Tommy Amaker came back to again and again when describing the Harvard men’s basketball team’s Saturday night win at Dartmouth. In a game full of runs and a late defensive effort from the Crimson, perhaps no word better describes what would to be the key to a 74-58 Crimson victory in its first conference matchup.
“You give them a lot of credit for how they competed against us, but I thought our bench and our balance was the difference,” Amaker said. “We’re hoping that can be the difference for us as we move forward. We played a lot of guys and they gave us quality minutes off the bench.”
DEPTH WINS IT
For Harvard, it was ultimately the depth of its roster that allowed it to pull away late in the second frame. Fueled by the efforts of freshman Justin Bassey off the bench—who matched his career-high of 14 points while adding six rebounds, three assists, and two steals—the Crimson pulled away midway through the second, going on a 15-4 run to push its lead to 16 points.
“Justin just played a great game,” co-captain Siyani Chambers said. “He rebounded well, he made big timely shots for us.”
After switching up its starting lineup in the second period, the Crimson began the period shooting a perfect six-for-six. In the second half, Harvard shot the ball 64 percent from the field while holding the Big Green to 41 percent. The depth of Harvard’s freshman class was on display as every freshman saw minutes and the group combined for 43 points.
In total, Harvard’s bench combined for 30 of the Crimson’s 74 points and 13 of the Crimson’s 32 rebounds. Other than Chambers, no Crimson player was on the court for more than thirty minutes, with 12 players seeing the floor. Dartmouth, for its part, had three of its starters play over 30 minutes.
“We’re trying to develop our bench—we can play seven or eight guys and make it very comfortable keep it neat on the stat sheet, but we’re choosing to try and see if we can play a lot of guys to wear others down,” Amaker said. “It’s been nice to see these guys step forward and when they have limited minutes still be productive.”
DEFENSE ON DISPLAY
While Harvard’s offense has been largely consistent throughout the season, Saturday’s matchup also gave the Crimson a chance to right some of the defensive struggles they have had throughout nonconference play.
In the first half the Crimson held the Big Green to 26 points on 36 percent shooting from the field while outrebounding Dartmouth, 21-16, and 8-4 on the offensive end. Perhaps more importantly, the Crimson neutralized the reigning Ivy League Rookie of the Year, sophomore forward Evan Boudreaux.
Through the first frame with a combination of senior Zena Edosomwan and freshman Chris Lewis defending him, Boudreaux went one-of-six from the field for only three points. He also turned the ball over twice.
“Boudreaux is a very good player, one of the better players in our league. Coming into the game we knew how much of a matchup that was going to be,” Amaker said. “So having Zena start the game on him was really helpful for us. I thought we started off well, we didn’t give anything easy, and I thought that set the tone.”
Boudreaux finished the game with 15 points and 14 rebounds, but would do so on 4-of-13 shooting from the field.
On the game, Harvard forced 17 Big Green turnovers while the guests only turned it over a season-low nine times. Throughout the matchup, Harvard would shut down the Dartmouth offense for extended periods of time. At one point in the first frame, the Crimson would hold the Big Green scoreless for a period of over four minutes, and Harvard closed the game without allowing a Dartmouth field goal over the last five minutes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the first three months of play, the Harvard women’s ice hockey team suffered losses, losses, and still more losses. In the first 11 games, the Crimson emerged victorious exactly once— against Dartmouth in late October.
Nevertheless, the outlook was hopeful when Harvard rung in the new year. In the team’s last game of 2016, the Crimson had tied No. 7 Colgate, 3-3, to halt a nine-game losing skid.
Harvard’s 2017 timetable wasted no time in providing a new challenge. On Jan. 6, Harvard tripped to Hamden, Conn., to square off against No. 8 Quinnipiac and then visited Princeton for a Saturday matinee.
The matchup with the Bobcats (15-5-4, 8-3-2) marked yet another ranked opponent on Harvard’s schedule—the Crimson has battled eight teams in the top 25 so far. Both the Tigers (12-6-2, 8-4-1) and Quinnipiac were familiar foes, having defeated Harvard earlier in the season by scores of 2-1.
The Crimson improved slightly on those earlier results. This time Harvard left the back-to-back contests with a tie and a loss.
“We played really hard in both games,” junior defenseman Chelsea Ziadie said. “Our team came out really strong in the first period…and that was one of our team goals.”
PRINCETON 2, HARVARD 1
Harvard failed to build upon the positive momentum it generated in the final third of its match against Quinnipiac. This time, it was the opposition who had the last laugh.
Despite entering the third period with a one-goal lead, the Crimson conceded two scores in the final 20 minutes en route to defeat. Three costly penalties, including a bench minor for too many players on the ice, hampered Harvard’s third period performance, as Princeton junior forward Kiersten Falck ultimately delivered the final blow on the power play.
“[Power play opportunities] are game changers,” Ziadie noted. “We’ve lost some games by one goal when we’ve been on the [penalty] kill and the other team has scored…. Even in the second period, there was a point where we were getting penalties, and the momentum shifted.”
After a goalless first frame, the Crimson opened the scoring in the second period courtesy of sophomore defenseman Kaitlin Tse’s stick. The man-up tally was the only blip in an otherwise stingy game for Tigers freshman goaltender Steph Neatby, whose 32 saves helped her improve to 6-1-0 on the season, good for the second-best win percentage in the ECAC.
The Saturday afternoon showdown was otherwise closely contested as each team notched a power play goal. Harvard emerged with a slim margin in shots (33-31) and faceoff wins (27-26) while both teams frequented the penalty box—the visitors six times and the hosts five.
Compared to its season average, the Crimson well surpassed its shots per game mark of 24.2 but was destined for a collision course with a hot goaltender who answered all but one attempt. Harvard’s relative scoring success on the road this year—1.67 goals per game as opposed to 1.40 at Bright-Landry—was not enough to crack the code of Neatby’s four-by-six safe.
“Off of those [33] shots, we had a ton of rebounds, and we didn’t take advantage of them,” Ziadie lamented. “One of the areas of our game that we wanted to improve was shooting a lot…and the next step will be to get to those rebounds and capitalize on those opportunities.”
On the other side of the ice, Harvard senior goaltender Molly Tissenbaum is still in search of her first victory of the season, as she moved to 0-7-0 after defeat at the hands of the Tigers. The Toronto native boasts a solid .925 save percentage this season but has not received the goal support from her skaters needed to outpace her 2.82 goals against average.
HARVARD 2, QUINNIPIAC 2
Harvard entered the final frame of regulation trailing the Bobcats by a goal. But the Crimson erased this late-game deficit thanks to freshman forward Kat Hughes, who buried her third score of the season on the man advantage with four minutes remaining. Junior forward Lexie Laing and senior defenseman Abbey Frazer notched assists on the power play equalizer.
“Coming back in the third period was huge,” Ziadie said. “Being able to take advantage of the power play—the opportunity to have them—is really important.”
Quinnipiac made Harvard pay for its two first period penalties and opened the scoring on freshman defenseman Kate MacKenzie’s power play strike. Having cashed in with the extra man, the Bobcats entered the intermission with a one-goal lead and a 12-2 advantage in shots on goal.
The second period saw even strength goals from both teams, including an opening minute score from Crimson co-captain Sydney Daniels, who found the back of the net from outside the right faceoff circle. Mere minutes later, Quinnipiac responded with a snipe of its own, regaining the lead—one which it would hold until Hughes’ clutch tally in the final minutes.
“In any game…it’s about bouncing right back and bringing the pressure to the other team,” Ziadie said, emphasizing that importance of “having that mentality to go back and get another [goal].”
In the middle period of Friday night’s game, Ziadie and her teammates were victims of that approach.
Overtime began with a flurry of Bobcat shots, all of which Harvard’s freshman netminder Beth Larcom, in only her second career start, deflected to safety. The extra time frame ended much the same way it started, but this time Crimson co-captain Briana Mastel took goaltending matters into her own hands, blocking two crucial shots during Quinnipiac’s final possession in its offensive zone. Larcom came to the rescue during a last-minute penalty shot attempt for Quinnipiac, which she stuffed at the doorstep after some nifty stick work from Bobcats freshman Kenzie Prater.
“[The penalty shot] was really exciting for Beth [Larcom]. She did a great job,” said Ziadie, applauding the work of her rookie netminder. “Again, we hope those situations don’t happen, but when they do, we know that our goalies are prepared for them.”
Although significantly outshot, 29-18, Harvard held its own against the Bobcats in faceoff wins, with the hosts holding just a two-win edge, and remained equally as disciplined, with each team taking three penalties on the night.
The Crimson boasts an all-time record of 18-5-3 against Quinnipiac, but recently the Bobcats have matched up relatively evenly with Harvard, as eight of the past nine meetings have been decided by one goal or less. The Crimson owns a 4-3-2 record over that span.
Additionally, with the overtime finish on Friday evening, Harvard has seen six of its past nine games require extra time, marking the only such stretch of overtime thrillers in program history.
On the weekend, freshman forward Val Turgeon led all Crimson scorers with a pair of helpers while contributing seven shots to Harvard’s total on Saturday. For the orange and black, sophomore forward Karlie Lund, reigning ECAC Rookie of the Year and First-Team conference selection, padded her lead in conference-wide point scoring (16-15-31) with a goal and an assist in Saturday’s match.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s basketball team came into Saturday’s Ivy League opener looking for a dominant win over a struggling Dartmouth squad. However, a poor shooting performance and uncharacteristic play of upperclassman leaders led to a Harvard victory, 70-65, that was anything but dominant.
“Once again, I love that my team toughed it out,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said.  “We found a way to win in a game where we didn’t necessarily play our best.”
The Big Green (5-9, 0-1 Ivy League) gave the Crimson (12-1, 1-0) all it could handle in the third quarter, as the Crimson was limited to nine points compared to Dartmouth’s 17.
“I don’t know what went wrong in the third quarter,” Delaney-Smith said. “I don’t have a reason. We have been practicing well, and we appeared to be ready to play. We have to go back and watch film to figure it out. I think we should have won by more, and I think our reaction to our poor shooting affected our game.”
Freshman Jeannie Boehm, freshman Katie Benzan, and co-captain Destiny Nunley all got into foul trouble early, and Harvard had to look to its bench for relief as crucial pieces of the team were forced to come out.
“We aren’t playing well and it comes down to somebody making a big play,” Delaney-Smith said. “Three of our five starters got into early foul trouble in the first half. Having three players out early is never good.”
The Big Green suffocated Harvard’s front court and forced the backcourt to make plays. Starting forwards Nunley and Boehm had four and two points, respectively, for the game. With the Crimson’s two dominant forwards limited to 36 percent from the field, Harvard did not play up to its season averages in both rebounding and defense.
“This is a bit abnormal for us because in the past when our shots aren’t falling we rely on other parts of our game,” Nunley said. “However, this time we got in our feelings a little bit, dropped our shoulders and put our heads down, which is very uncharacteristic of us. I think that it was definitely a learning experience and we just have to bounce back from it. We need to depend more on our defense and rebounding, not just our three-point shots.”
The Crimson, although missing the three starters early in the game, ended the first half leading by three points. It was led by sophomore guard Madeline Raster who had 15 points and five boards in the first half. Junior guard Taylor Rooks provided quality minutes off the bench as well, producing 10 points and four rebounds. Despite the strong offensive performance, it was Rooks’ effort on the defensive end that impressed the coaching staff.
“I expected that from Taylor Rooks all along,” Delaney-Smith said. “She wants to play and she wants to win. So we have been [telling] her that if she wants to play, she will be playing defense, and she did that very well today. She is an effective offensive player, but when she plays the defense she is capable of playing, then she is a very good player. I felt that this was her best game so far.”
Despite Harvard’s starters returning to the game in the second half, Dartmouth refused to go quietly and limited the hot-handed Raster to two points after intermission. Only two Crimson players scored more than six points in the second half. Benzan, however, refused to be limited in the second half after early foul trouble, and continued the quality play of the young guards on the team.
The play of underclassmen Raster and Benzan was critical in Saturday’s victory. The coaching staff as well as upperclassmen grow increasingly impressed as the two young guards grow and mature as the season rolls on.
“They’re both so much fun to watch and to play with,” Nunley said. “They’re incredibly unselfish for how great scorers they are. I think they are just selfless, and that contributes to how good they are. We want Madeline to shoot all day, everyone is confident in her shot, I know I depend on it. Katie is really young, but it is so impressive how well she has transitioned into D-1 play.”
Saturday’s victory not only marks a win in the Ivy League, but was also the 12th in a row for Harvard. It is the team’s longest win streak since the 2006-2007 campaign.
Despite the win and the streak, the Crimson will have a chance to improve upon its fundamentals with a nonconference tune-up against La Salle on Wednesday in Philadelphia.
““Fundamentals. Basically, the irony is that La Salle is an entirely different team then we will see in the Ivy League,” Delaney-Smith said. “We’re going to have to execute a lot better. We didn’t execute on the offensive end as well as we needed to until the end, but we need to do that the whole game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Non-conference opponents can often present a challenge, but the No. 23 Harvard men’s swimming and diving team had no difficulty in dispatching a trio of rivals from outside of the Ivy League this weekend.
The Crimson traveled out West for a pair of meets on Friday and Saturday, sweeping aside BYU (1-2) in Provo, Utah, before topping Utah (4-4) and No. 24 Denver (5-3) in Salt Lake City. The wins allowed Harvard (6-0, 3-0 Ivy) to maintain its unblemished record.
The Crimson’s efforts were spearheaded yet again by freshman Dean Farris, who picked up a team-high seven wins across the two meets.
The first-year’s classmates were not far behind, with freshman Daniel Chang collecting two individual victories, fellow rookie Zach Snyder racking up a trio of top-three finishes, and freshman Raphael Marcoux chipping in a relay win.
The strong performances in both meets added to what has been an impressive debut season for Farris and the Harvard freshmen in general.
“The freshman class has really stepped up this entire season,” junior Kent Haeffner said. “They've been doing all the right things in and out of the pool, and that's been reflected in the times they've produced. We're excited about what they can do going forward.”
Utah and Denver
Led by four wins from Farris, Harvard held off the Utes and No. 24 Pioneers by margins of 192-133 and 196-124, respectively, to improve to 6-0 on the season.
Despite having to stop late pushes from both opponents, the Crimson took top marks in eight of 14 events, placing swimmers on the podium in all but two races.
Farris played a part in half of the team’s wins. In the opening event of the meet, the first-year anchored the lineup of juniors Steven Tan and Shane McNamara and senior Max Yakubovich as the quartet took top marks in the 200 medley relay.
The meet ended the way it began, with Farris collecting another team victory in the 400 freestyle relay along with junior Ed Kim, senior Jack Manchester, and classmate Marcoux.
In between the relays, Farris also notched a pair of solo wins. The Atlanta native touched the wall first in both the 100 and 200 freestyle events. Snyder took third place in the 200 free.
Harvard showed the same depth it has all season, with the upperclassmen picking up a number of victories as well, starting with a win for sophomore Brennan Novak in the 1000 freestyle. Sophomore Logan Houck took third in the event.
McNamara notched a solo victory of his own in the 100 breaststroke, beating second-place Chang to the wall by less than a tenth of a second. Chang got revenge in the 200 breaststroke, taking top marks as co-captain Eric Ronda took second place.
Tan collected the Crimson’s final victory of the meet in the 100 butterfly, as Yakubovich finished less than a second behind the junior for third place.
Tan, Snyder, and junior Koya Osada each collected second-place finishes in the 50 freestyle, 200 backstroke, and 500 freestyle to cement the win.
BYU
Harvard faced a familiar opponent in BYU, having already raced against the Cougars at the Texas Invitational in November. The results from the previous meet were effectively repeated, as the Crimson defeated BYU in decisive fashion, 120-70, in the Cougars’ home pool.
The result was never really in doubt, as the team of Yakubovich, Manchester, McNamara, and Farris won the 400 medley relay to open the meet. Sophomore Daniel Tran, Chang, Tan, and sophomore Sebastian Lutz took second place in the event, more than a second ahead of the third-place finishers from BYU.
Harvard would go on to win every race, taking at least two of the top three spots in each event along the way.
The Crimson’s performance was highlighted by podium sweeps in the 1650 freestyle, 400 IM, and 200 backstroke.
Houck, sophomore Gavin Springer, and Snyder captured the top three spots in the 1650 free, while Chang took first, senior Christian Carbone ended up second, and Tran was third in the 400 IM. Tran would get his solo win in the 200 back, touching the wall ahead of second-place Manchester, with co-captain Mitchell Foster in bronze position.
Farris also added two more individual wins to his already extensive collection, taking top marks in both the 100 and 200 freestyle. Kim and senior Aly Abdel Khalik finished third in the 100 and 200-yard iterations of the event, respectively.
Elsewhere, Osada emerged victorious in the 200 butterfly, with senior Sava Turcanu four seconds behind in second place, putting an exclamation point on the victory.
With three more wins to its name, Harvard will return to Ivy League action next week with a perfect record and a sense of guarded confidence.
“This weekend was probably the hardest weekend in our schedule, so I think picking up three wins will definitely generate some positive momentum, especially mentally,” Yakubovich said. “The trick will be to not get complacent as we head into our last two regular season meets.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its last tournament before the beginning of dual matchups, the Harvard wrestling team traveled to Lancaster, Pa., and brought home an individual gold at the Franklin and Marshall Open.
In the day-long tournament at the Alumni Sports and Fitness Center, the Crimson achieved four quarterfinal finishes, including a successful gold medal campaign by junior co-captain Josef Johnson (174 lbs.).
“Throughout my college career, I've struggled with consistency and that was my focus for the tournament,” Johnson said. “One of my coaches heavily emphasized wrestling a complete, focused seven-minute match without breaks in intensity. I definitely moved closer to wrestling really complete matches and I felt dominant.”
His third top-three finish this year, Johnson went 5-0 to claim his spot atop the podium. He started the match with two victories, one against Charles Layer of Rowan and the next against Terrell Forbes of Old Dominion. Johnson then claimed two consecutive shutouts with a 7-0 victory against Nunizo Cowley of Binghamton and a 4-0 win against Cody Hughes of Virginia Tech. The championship bout was hardly a competition as Johnson easily took down Garrett Peppelman of Virginia, 6-2.
Overall, Johnson’s championship tournament was won with three by decision, one pin, and a medical forfeit. With the victories, Johnson now boasts a season record of 18-5. The co-captain has placed at every single tournament in which he has appeared.
The Franklin and Marshall Open featured 350 wrestlers and nearly 30 programs from across the East Coast. It is the third top-three finish by Johnson, with others coming at the Jonathan Kaloust Open and the Keystone Classic.
“My offense from neutral was solid, but the biggest takeaway was my performance on top,” Johnson said. “Typically, I'm not very effective on top in critical matches, but today, I rode my opponents well and gained a lot of confidence in that position. I haven't walked out of a tournament feeling this good about my performance in a long time.”
Co-Captain Jeffrey Ott (133 lbs.) was another one of Harvard’s wrestlers to reach the semifinal stage. The senior charted three straight wins to reach the final four. The first came with a pin victory over Kenan Bottorf of Lock Haven. Two technical falls aided Ott as he took wins against both Joe Silwoski of Clarion and Theodore Powers of Ivy League rival Brown. With the three victories, Ott now holds nine on the season and a team-leading 63 in his career.
Three wins for co-captain Nicholas Gajdzik (285 lbs.) got him to the semifinal round. One was a decision victory against Gary Traub and another against Anthony Brownridge of Campbell in a victory by fall. Gajdzik improved his season total wins to 12.
Junior Logan Kirby (197 lbs.) also reached the quarterfinals of the tournament for the Crimson. Other members of the team posting multiple wins included junior Angus Cowell (285 lbs.), junior Kanon Dean (184 lbs.) and senior Colby Knight (149 lbs.). Overall, the team finished with 55 points.
“The team displayed a lot of grit,” Cowell said. “We just need to work on staying consistently aggressive throughout the match.”
The first of the dual matchup competitions will take place next Saturday at the Pitt Duals.
“In a lot of matches, outcomes came down to one or two critical positions, which we can fortunately focus on as we approach team competition,” Johnson said. “So a great part of the whole team competing is we'll have some refined emphasis points for practice as we head into team competition. We have a group that knows how to respond so I'm confident that we'll continue to build from here.”

The No. 23 Harvard men’s swimming and diving team split up its roster this week, sending a contingent of divers to face a pair of non-conference opponents for two diving-only meets.
The Crimson (6-0, 3-0 Ivy) squared off against Utah (4-4) in Salt Lake City on Tuesday before taking on No. 23 Denver (5-4) in the El Pomar Natatorium. Harvard came away with decisive wins against both opponents, taking nine of the possible 12 podium spots and winning all but one event.
The Crimson’s efforts against Utah were highlighted by a win in the three-meter dive by junior David Pfeiffer. The Merrimack, N.H. native racked up 303.83 points, beating out Utes sophomore Daniel Theriault in second and junior Bobby Ross in third place.
It was Ross who would take top marks against Denver, however, as the junior finished first in both the one and three-meter events against the Pioneers. Ross edged out second-place Pfeiffer by less than half a point for the win in the one-meter dive, with senior Manasseh Oso rounding out the podium in third.
Ross posted a more decisive margin of victory on the three-meter board, totaling 298.58 points, while Pfeiffer finished in second with 287. 63 points to complete the Harvard sweep.
The only event in which the Crimson did not claim victory between the two meets was the one-meter dive against Utah. Utes senior Josiah Purss took the top spot with 310.35 points, with Ross 24 points back in second and Pfeiffer not far behind in third place.
The Harvard divers will rejoin the swimming portion of the team next week as the Crimson returns to Ivy League action against Penn and Brown.
