After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

One: Voice
“You can’t be Muslim and gay. You just can’t.”
“You’re wrong.”
“You can have gay thoughts — I sympathize with that. You didn’t choose to have those thoughts. But when you act on them, that is the sin. That is your choice.”
“I cannot believe in a God that wouldn’t want me to find love. A God who would want me and people like me to hate myself for whom I love. A God who would never let me love myself for who I really am.”
“But that’s what I mean — that’s not who you really are! Those are just thoughts. You, you are your actions! You can change. You can still have a family. Be normal.”
“God wants me to love myself for This Me. You are wrong.”

Two: Colonial Violence
“Sodomy laws are a Western invention, a colonial legacy.”
“What are you talking about? The West is pushing the world forward, toward tolerance of LGBTQ+ people, toward acceptance.”
“Maybe that’s how it seems now. But way back when, the British came to India and instituted Section 377, making sodomy illegal. They codified it — they made being gay illegal in India, Malaysia, Uganda, Kenya…I don’t even know where else.” [Author’s note: Over 80 countries worldwide still criminalize same-sex acts between men, often women too. Over half of these countries possess such discriminatory laws as a legacy of British colonialism.]
“Well, do you really think those places would have been better off without the British? You really think they would have been more progressive than they are now?”
“I guess we’ll never know. We will never have the chance to know.”
“Yeah.”
“But look to Hindu ideas of gender and sexual fluidity — the ones that were purged by British colonialism. Look to the Islamic tradition of ghazal poetry — the homoeroticism in it. Maybe, if given the chance, India could have been the progressive one. The East would be pushing the world forward, toward tolerance of LGBTQ+ people and ideas, toward acceptance.”

Three: A Prized Parable
Lot, nephew of Ibrahim, migrated from Ur to preach righteousness to the lustful and violent people of Sodom and Gomorrah. In the Quranic version of the tale, the shahwa (desire) and fahisha (abomination) of the people of Sodom and Gomorrah has been read (narrowly) as referencing homosexual acts.
There is no other Quranic basis for Islam’s alleged condemnation of same-sex acts.
I recently purchased Scott Siraj al-Haqq Kugle’s “Homosexuality in Islam: Critical Reflection on Gay, Lesbian, and Transgender Muslims.” I have not had the chance to read it yet, but it is referenced compellingly in Dr. Greifenhagen’s piece: A Muslim Non-Heteronormative Reading of the Story of Lot:
“…the story [of Lot] is really about infidelity and how the Tribe of Lot schemed for ways to reject his Prophethood and his public standing in their community…They rejected him in a variety of ways, and their sexual assault of his guests was only one expression of their inner intention to deny Lot the dignity of being a Prophet and drive him from their cities (Kugle, 51, 52).”
Dr. Greifenhagen writes further,
“...the sins of the people of Sodom were wide ranging, and insofar as any of them were specifically sexual, they concerned not homosexual inclinations or acts in general, but rather specifically male anal rape of men, a transgression of hospitality and a common technique of shaming and emasculation used by heterosexual men against other men.”
Just one story narrowly read, by so many and for so long, to accommodate the social mores of those in power. Until recently, until analyses like Kugle’s and Greifenhagen’s.

Four: Me vs. Me
“Why am I attracted to men?”
“What do you mean?”
“I mean, men have hurt me. Men hurt women. Women have hurt me too, sure, but not in the same way, and not nearly to the same degree. I am not afraid of women the way I am afraid of men. So why do I still see myself spending my life with a man?”
“It’s not a choice. That’s just who you’re attracted to.”
“But isn’t it my choice to have never even tried to be with a woman? To have written it off as not for me? Isn’t that just the way I’ve been socialized? If I truly believe, as I say I do, that gender is not a binary, that sexuality is a spectrum, how can I adhere so closely to straightness? And to such a toxic form of it? I am attracted to the worst kind of man, the alpha male, the one who can ‘take care of me’ and ‘protect me.’ That’s fucked up.”
“You can’t choose who you’re attracted to — it just is what it is.”
“…I don’t think that’s true. We’re all socialized to believe something is the norm, and even if we are attracted to a specific trait because we’ve grown up being told that’s how it’s supposed to be, or seen everyone else acting that way, we can definitely learn to question that norm. Try to unlearn it. To expand our idea of attractiveness by trying to recognize where the damaging ideas of attractiveness come from.”
“…”
“I think I’ve never considered being with a woman because I am afraid of what that would mean for me. Religiously, culturally.”
“Well—”
“I know fear of men isn’t a good reason to seek women — that’s not really my point. My point is just this: Why am I attracted to men, and specifically, the dominating, alpha-male type of man? If I see sexuality and gender as fluid, why aren’t I practicing what I preach? Why am I letting what I — allegedly — perceive to be society-dictated norms of behavior, divided into artificial identities of ‘man’ and ‘woman,’ determine who I am romantically attracted to?”

Five: Active Allyship
Much of this column has been concerned with my identity as a woman in relation to men. In every reference to gender and sex, the installments of this column have subscribed to the gender binary.
This is my privilege as a straight, cis-woman: to be writing about experiences of gender and sex without any mention of fluidity. It is not a matter that has come up in my lived existence; it is not something that I have had to think about when considering my Fear, or my First Kisses.
But I know that I cannot call myself any kind of activist if I am not an active ally to the LGBTQ+ community. This installment is a weak step, but at minimum, a necessary one, in my personal journey of unlearning, decolonizing. I focused first on my own story, then worked outward.
Next: reading Kugle’s analysis over break, arming myself with that knowledge. Always seeking to learn from those most impacted by the intolerance and violence. Doing my best as an ally to empower their voices. Battling those who claim you cannot occupy those two realms at once: gay, Muslim.
—Contributing writer Minahil A. Khan’s column, “Unlearning, Decolonizing,” navigates the landscape of identity in her journey as a Brown Muslim immigrant woman decolonizing her psyche. Through personal narrative, it will explore the vacillation between self-love and self-hate, relationships with one’s family and cultural as well as religious communities, and the homeland, both imagined and lived.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Professor of the Practice of Public Philosophy Cornel R. West ’74 will return to teaching African and African American Studies 10: “Introduction to African American Studies” this semester after 18 years away from the course.
West, who returned to Harvard in 2017 after a nearly 14-year break spent teaching at Princeton University, last taught the course in 2000. In recent years, African and African-American Studies Professors Henry Louis Gates Jr. and Lawrence D. Bobo have led the course, but Bobo’s promotion to divisional dean of Social Science last fall forced the course to restructure, opening up the opportunity for West to teach it once again.
West said he is excited to able to teach the course after years away, calling the experience of teaching it a “blessing.”
His own academic work mainly concerns itself with the intersection between religion, social analysis, and philosophical thought. West said he will incorporate this multidimensional approach in teaching AAAS 10 by drawing from a range of disciplinary perspectives.
West described the revamped course as a “fusion of the philosophical, the historical, and the political,” adding that he will incorporate some artistic elements including “good music and literature” as well.
One of the main focuses of the course will be illustrating how African-American intellectual movements responding to catastrophe were influenced by various temperaments and historical schools of thought, according to West.
“I’m trying to show the ways in which the Socratic legacy of Athens, the prophetic legacy of Jerusalem, and the scientific legacy of the Enlightenment, and the democratic legacy of American Romanticism feed into the black intellectual tradition,” West said.
“[The class] really shows the way in which African American intellectuals were hybrid intellectuals, influenced by a number of very deep and strong traditions,” he added.
While many of the texts — which draw from canonical works of the African-American intellectual tradition — will be the same as the ones examined in Bobo’s and Gates’ version of the course, West said his exploration will take a different approach.
“[Bobo and Gates] teach in terms of debates that have been going on; whereas my course I think will be a course taught by me.” West said. “It is different being taught primarily by one person.”
West said he’s most looking forward to teaching texts written by fellow Harvard professors — authors that include Gates, Sociology Professor Orlando H. L. Patterson, and African and African-American Studies Professor Tommie Shelby.
“What’s in part exciting is that we read great classical texts, but [the course] also includes my colleagues,” West said. “That’s what’s so magnificent about teaching the course.”
CORRECTION: Jan. 19, 2019
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated West is an African and African-American Studies professor. In fact, his title is Professor of the Practice of Public Philosophy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Ivy League slate started off with a bang. For the Big Green.
Defeating Harvard in the Ancient Eight opener for the first time in 12 seasons, Dartmouth walked off Leede Arena on Saturday night to a standing ovation in its 81-63 rout of the Crimson.
The Big Green (10-7, 1-0 Ivy) shot an impressive 68.1 percent from the field, including 11 triples for a team with three players averaging 48 percent or higher from deep. Eight of those triples came in a first frame which saw Dartmouth jump out to a 44-29 lead. Harvard (6-7, 0-1) narrowed the gap to nine with four minutes left on a clock that seemed to tick too fast for the visitors, but could not draw the contest any closer.
“[Dartmouth] played really well together and shot the ball really well,” coach Tommy Amaker said. “Disappointed in the areas we were deficient in, we didn’t finish well around the rim and at the foul line. When you are on the road you have to do those things there.”
Beyond the accurate shooting from long range, the Big Green saw another all-around dominant performance from sophomore forward Chris Knight, who outscored counterpart Chris Lewis 20 to 12 while adding 3 blocks. The Madison, Wisc., native’s 8-of-10 performance was complemented by three other Dartmouth starters in double figures. Junior guard Brendan Barry, who leads the nation in three-point accuracy at 51.8 percent, contributed three more triples to his season tally.
The Crimson starting unit opened up the contest sluggishly but held onto a narrow 17-13 margin halfway through the first frame thanks to a offensive jolt from bench contributors. First year guard Noah Kirkwood contributed two early layups alongside opportunities underneath the rim for bigs Henry Welsh and Mason Forbes.
“I thought we started fairly well and decent on the defensive end,” Amaker said. “ I thought [Dartmouth] adjusted and settled in and made shots and got their confidence going.”
The latter portion of the half was a completely different narrative, as alluded to by Amaker. The galore of three pointers began for the Big Green as a 19-18 deficit flipped into a 10-point lead thanks to converted triples on three consecutive possessions. Another trio of treys completed the 8-of-14 first half outing, and the Crimson equally had few answers for Knight in the interior. The balanced offensive attack resulted in 12 Dartmouth assists in the frame, double the Crimson’s mark.
Also giving the Crimson coaching staff headaches were numerous easy opportunities at the rim off pick-and-roll feeds or back cuts for Coach McLaughlin’s side. With the Big Green’s most imposing big Will Emery injured for this contest, Dartmouth countered its relative lack of size with quickness and ball movement on the offensive end.
Of the Crimson’s 29 first half points, seven came at the hands of junior guard Christian Juzang — who seemed at times to be the sole spirited spark in the middle of the Harvard scoring abyss. The starting point guard finished the contest with a team-high 20 points with three triples of his own. That point tally is his highest of the season and first double-digit night in four games.
The Crimson did make things more interesting in the second frame, at the minimum giving over-confident fans in Hanover second thoughts about leaving the game early.
The Big Green pulled itself out to its largest lead of the contest(21) at the 16:09 mark but subsequently went cold from deep (and the field) as Harvard veered closer to breaking its double-digit margin. A 12-2 run from the 14-minute point to 10-minute mark brought the Crimson the scoreline to 59-49 as coach McLaughlin called a timeout. In that span, Lewis regained some confidence back in his interior finishing with two layups while Juzang added two more finishes at the rim.
That break in action by McLaughlin proved to be an astute decision. Dartmouth regained its defensive composure and halted the bleeding. In the final minutes of action, with the lead still nailed at around 10, the Big Green pulled out the dagger with two critical threes(once again) by junior guard James Foye.
In more uplifting news for Crimson supporters, the much-anticipated return of former Ivy Rookie of the Year Bryce Aiken appears to be on the horizon. Aiken dressed for the first time this season and engaged in pregame warmups, but remained on the bench throughout this game. Classmate Seth Towns, the other critical piece missing for Harvard this season, has similarly warmed up prior to recent games and his return to the court appears to be fast-approaching.
The Crimson has one more non-conference contest against Howard wedged in between its Dartmouth doubleheader and will head down to Washington D.C. for Martin Luther King Day. With students returning back to campus the following weekend, the sequel of this matchup will also be in store on Jan. 26.
“Hopefully we can correct [our mistakes], get better, and get ready for the next one,” Amaker concluded.
