After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the latest development of a heated publicity battle, filmmakers of a popular documentary that criticizes Harvard Law School’s handling of a sexual assault case penned an op-ed for the Huffington Post sharply rebuking Law professors who have challenged the film.
Released last spring semester, “The Hunting Ground” film follows the narrative of Law School alumna Kamilah Willingham, who alleges she and a friend were sexually assaulted during Willingham’s time at the school. The film criticizes the Law School’s response to Willingham’s case, focusing on the school’s decision to overturn the initial dismissal for Willingham’s alleged perpetrator. While the film—which is shortlisted for an Oscar nomination for best documentary feature—does not identify the accused, press releases from the Law professors and the filmmakers name Law student Brandon Winston.
A group of 19 Law School professors signed a press release criticizing the film’s depiction of the case soon before it aired on CNN  in November, calling it a “an unfair and misleading portrayal of the facts.” Soon after,  Winston’s lawyers launched a website called The Brandon Project, which features a series of public court documents, in an effort to clear Winston’s name. The filmmakers, in turn, denounced the website.
Now, the filmmakers are again responding in full force. Their article, titled “How Harvard Law Professors Retaliated Against An Assault Survivor,” casts the Law professors’ public criticisms and the Brandon Project website as misleading efforts to retaliate against Willingham and discredit victims of sexual assault.
“These aggressive actions send a very chilling message to all current and future students at Harvard and Harvard Law: if you report a sexual assault, your professors may come after you publicly,” filmmakers Amy Ziering and Kirby Dick wrote.
The filmmakers also alleged that the professors timed their criticism to coincide with the launch of the school’s $305 million capital campaign.
“The disturbing irony is that Harvard Law is doing exactly what The Hunting Ground shows universities have done for the past 50 years: discrediting survivors to protect their own reputations and funding, all at the expense of their students’ safety and well-being,” Ziering and Dick wrote.
When they first publicly criticized the film, the Law professors said the national audience the film would  receive when it aired on CNN prompted them to act publicly.
In a statement, Law School spokesperson Robb London denied the filmmakers’ allegations that professors’ critiques of the film were intended to minimize problems of sexual assault at the school ahead of fundraising efforts. He wrote in the statement that Law School Dean Martha L. Minow regularly communicates with alumni about the realities of sexual assault at the school and the broader University, and “alumni know it, donors know it, and we talk about it with them.”
“The claim that the Law School is trying to protect its reputation during a fundraising campaign by somehow hiding the sexual assault issue from donors is not supported by facts that could have been easily checked, had Mr. Dick or Ms. Ziering checked with us,” London wrote.
Law professors who have publicly challenged the film similarly took issue with the premise and title of the filmmakers’ op-ed. Janet E. Halley, one of the 19 professors who criticized the documentary in November, denied that she and the other professors were retaliating against or targeting Willingham and said the professors’ statements were critical of the film itself, not any individual student.
“The reason I participated in the Law professors’ press release is not that a student came forward and complained about sexual assault, nor that she complained in the criminal process,” Halley said. “It is that ‘The Hunting Ground’ has profoundly misled the public about the ensuing processes which came out decisively against those claims.”
Jeannie C. Suk, another professor who signed the public release, said her criticism of the film stemmed from concerns about fair sexual assault grievance processes, not retaliating against individual complainants.
“There is this idea that we have to stand by and support or be silent about a film that does a very poor job of moving forward fair and effective policy or else be considered deniers of the problem,” Suk said.  “That’s just a proposition that I don’t accept.”
In a statement, the filmmakers reiterated their previous charges against the Law School, which the federal government found in violation of anti-sex discrimination law Title IX in late 2014, and wrote that high profile professors have sought to quash scrutiny directed at the school.
“When documentaries bring to light uncomfortable truths about powerful people and institutions, it's not unusual for them to wage aggressive campaigns to silence their critics,” the filmmakers wrote. “That's what we're seeing now.”
The Oscar nominations will be announced January 14.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Playing in its last non-conference matchup of the season, the Harvard women’s basketball team couldn’t erase a 19-point deficit despite a late comeback attempt against Chattanooga on Monday night.
In its fourth matchup of a competitive five-game road trip, the Crimson (5-8) struggled to catch up to the Mocs (9-5) for much of the game after losing an early lead. In the last three and a half minutes of play, Harvard made a late run, scoring 16 points, but Chattanooga came away with the victory, 62-58.
Although the Crimson’s ’s three seniors—AnnMarie Healy, Shilpa Tummala, and Kit Metoyer—had averaged a combined 40 points over the past three games, Harvard struggled to hit shots. Early foul trouble also cost the Crimson as the game progressed.
“Shilpa got into foul trouble early and had to sit the whole first half,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “When that happens to Shilpa or AnnMarie, unfortunately that has an effect on us. But it shouldn’t have.”
With the clock winding down in the last minute of the fourth, Crimson freshman Sydney Skinner heaved up a three with a defender in her face. She drained it, with the foul, to pull the Crimson  within nine.
After fouling the Mocs, Harvard put the ball in Tummala’s hands for the last two possessions. She drained two long threes, but it wouldn’t be enough as the clock ran out before  the Crimson could finish the late comeback. All told, Harvard ended the game on a 16-3 run.
“I think that in those three and four minutes, we wanted it,” Healy said. “When I got back into the locker room, that’s what I told the team: ‘What is it going to take for us to take those three minutes and turn it into forty?’”
Healy lead the Crimson with 19 points while Tummala added 11 points and seven rebounds. However, Harvard sharpshooter Kit Metoyer failed to score on a season-low three shot attempts.
After trading shots through much of the first half, the Crimson recorded a single field goal in the last five minutes of the second period. Despite the offensive difficulties, Harvard’s biggest obstacle was getting stops on defense, as Chattanooga ended the second quarter on an 11-2 run.
The Crimson struggled to stop the Mocs in the lane, allowing 34 points in the paint. Chattanooga forward Jasmine Joyner led the charge with 16 points and 9 rebounds.
“It was very disappointing because scout was to stop the drive, and occasionally we didn’t do a good job of stopping the drive,” Delaney-Smith said. “For spurts of time when they got their big lead, they got a lot of offensive rebounds. We just had some breakdowns.”
Harvard’s struggles began early in the matchup. With Tummala on the bench, the Crimson gave up an early four-point lead to close the period down 16-10. Harvard turned the ball over six times in the first frame alone.
After giving up the lead early, the Crimson  struggled to catch up late. While Harvard capitalized off turnovers, it struggled in transition. Chattanooga put up 10 fast-break points while the Crimson failed to score on the break.
In contrast to Harvard’s offensive woes, The Mocs shot 50 percent in the second half of the matchup to pull out of reach.
“They got a big lead, and we staged a comeback, but it wasn’t enough,” Delaney-Smith said. “We have talent and we have athleticism, but we’re young…. [W]e don’t use those tools as often and wisely as I would like to.”
Even so, the Crimson showed flashes of athletic talent throughout the matchup. After struggling to grab boards throughout the season, the team outrebounded Chattanooga, 37-35.
“I have a lot of faith in our team,” Healy said. “We’re a really good team, and I can’t wait to see what we look like when we put four quarters together.”
