After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Baruch de Spinoza wrote that “all creatures yearn to persist in their being,” an insight that explains the momentum propelling Joyce Carol Oates’s new memoir, “A Widow’s Story.” Oates weaves a graceful and captivating tale about what it is like to watch a loved one cease to persist in his or her being and how survivors must learn to live without those they love.
Oates begins by recounting her husband Ray’s initial admission to the hospital for an E. coli infection, presented in fragmented sentences and episodes that evoke Oates’s troubled stream of consciousness. The narrative then describes Ray’s worsening condition, and follows her as she mourns his untimely death. Oates must deal with the practical aftermath of Ray’s death—funeral plans, sorting through his belongings, medical bills—as she is forced to learn on the job how to be a widow.
From the opening of the memoir, Oates sweeps readers into a whirlwind of confusion, passion, and sorrow. Oates renders herself extremely vulnerable throughout the story. She opens up her heart, mind, and soul to all of the pain caused by this sudden and devastating change in her life. It is abundantly clear that Oates uses this memoir for personal catharsis. Her transformation from being happily married to being an accepting widow occurs as she progresses through the writing of the book.
Oates brilliantly manipulates her prose to make her story compelling on multiple levels. Initially, one might feel compassion for Oates and mourn the termination of her married life along with her. However, this involvement extends further, burrowing deep into the heart of the story. In nostalgic anecdotes about her husband and descriptions of her despair Oates convincingly recreates the thoughts, daydreams, and distractions that make up the process of mourning.
Oates focuses on the minutiae of her daily life and the experience of having a loving relationship with another individual. Her emphasis is not on her specific experiences but on the emotions behind them. This makes for a wrenching and utterly relatable memoir. At one point Oates wakes up in the middle of the night to the ‘dread’ of a “phone ringing at the wrong time” to receive the news that her husband is in critical condition. Rather than focusing on this episode’s role in her own narrative, she instead emphasizes that “we all know this dread. There is no escape from this dread.” It is easy to generalize Oates’ experience of “embark[ing] upon the hospital vigil as in a small canoe on a churning white-water river,” because she puts her experience in such universal terms.
“A Widow’s Story” is also a success in form. Oates does not miss a single chance to alter her book’s structure and style to reflect her own emotions; she thus forces even skeptical readers to experience her new reality. For example, Oates literalizes her devastation and emotional stasis by leaving the memoir’s page numbers unlisted. Instead, each chapter begins on page ‘000.’ The experience of reading the book then mirrors the confusion and stasis that Oates feels in her own life. Similarly, Oates deviates frequently from the story’s chronological plot: she offers digressions that are triggered by “memory pools” lurking in the corners of the mind and the shadows of the memory. These flashbacks painstakingly recreate the inner experience of mourning, and defy an emotionally detached reading.
Oates also alters her structure by ending chapters in the third person. She shifts from her own first-person account of to a third-person narrator viewing her story from the outside. These abrupt shifts to a more removed tone make the memoir intellectually stimulating as well as emotionally powerful. Oates becomes the character of “the Widow” or “the Widow-to-Be;” these detached examinations of her widowhood become their own story. Instead of simply stating that she would not research E. coli while her husband was hospitalized, Oates writes, “Something of the derangement of Widowhood is beginning here ... In denial that her husband is seriously ill the Widow-to-Be will not, when she returns home that evening, research E. coli on the Internet.” This unique technique breaks up the lengthy first-person narrative and prevents monotony. Through this technique, Oates keeps the narrative moving and builds a sense of anticipation despite her own emotional inertia.
More than anything, this memoir is a story of survival after devastation, learning to move on after life seems shattered. The essence of “A Widow’s Story” is perfectly and elegantly summed up by the last chapter, entitled “The Widow’s Handbook.” Oates concludes with a message of hope: “Of the widow’s countless death-duties there is really just one that matters: on the first anniversary of her husband’s death the widow should think I kept myself alive.”

What’s in a name? Would that which we call a film by any other name smell as sweet? In the case of “Gnomeo & Juliet,” the answer is certainly ‘no.’ Despite the punny title and amusing concept, this children’s movie adaptation of the Shakespearean classic is just another formulaic, animated gimmick not destined to impress audiences older than seven.
On Verona Drive in neighboring houses addressed 2B and Not 2B live two feuding garden gnome families—the Montagues and Capulets. During a costume ball, dressed like half-robbers, half-ninjas, Gnomeo and Juliet meet on simultaneous, secret midnight missions to pick an alluring orchid growing atop a nearby barn and fall instantly in love. Caught between their conflicting families—whose warring continually escalates in cartoonish intensity—their fate seems to be as star-crossed as their literary counterparts. Yet, as one would expect from a film made for kids, “Gnomeo & Juliet” veers quickly away from tragedy and instead indulges in comedy.
It is precisely in this arena where “Gnomeo & Juliet” flounders most. The film relies too heavily on awkwardly placed pop-culture references to carry its comedy. From a strange gnomic version of a “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon” fight scene to an oddly-placed imitation of the rose petal scene from “American Beauty,” the absurd number of ostentatious winks to adults—including a handful of forced double-entendres—disrupt the film’s narrative flow and detract from the movie’s ability to deliver any kind of genuine, heartfelt message. These repeated digressions not only distract viewers from the storyline but also beg the question as to who is the true audience of the film and its gags.
This is not to say that the film fails entirely as a comedy. Some of the Shakespeare references—including those mentioned above—are rather witty; they show the film at its satirical best. The garden flamingo character of Featherstone (Jim Cummings) is inspired, and his lines strike the proper balance between random humor and basic storybook character that so often eludes the movie.
Accompanying Cummings is a protracted list of relatively big names, all of whom acquit themselves satisfactorily. James McAvoy and Emily Blunt voice Gnomeo and Juliet themselves, and the movie boasts cameos from the likes of Ozzy Osbourne, Dolly Parton, and Hulk Hogan. Elton John, the executive producer of “Gnomeo & Juliet,” also makes a quick appearance as a glittery purple-suited gnome playing a ballad on the piano.
Elton John takes center stage in the film’s soundtrack, which includes classics like “Saturday Night’s Alright (For Fighting),” “Tiny Dancer,” and a new version of “Crocodile Rock” with Nelly Furtado. Perhaps the choice of songs was meant to embody the feel intended for the movie as a whole: fun, kid-accessible material with some parental appeal. Unfortunately, the film fails to deliver on this promise beyond the music.
“Gnomeo & Juliet” is visually pleasing, but not exceptionally so given the advanced state of today’s computer-generated imagery. Its 3D scenes are decidedly mixed in quality. On the one hand, a rainy scene on the screen rather effectively creates the illusion of rain in the theater. On the other hand, when the camera drops down to street level to create the effect of objects flying at the audience during a lawnmower chase scene, the resulting visual is subpar, reminiscent more of a video game than a film.
“Gnomeo & Juliet” is far too confused to succeed. Despite star vocal casting, a first-rate soundtrack, and—for the most part—attractive 3D visuals, the film never finds its groove. Instead, “Gnomeo & Juliet” goes astray with one too many forced nods to its adult audience, turning what could have been a fun take on an old favorite into just another forgettable animated flick chock-full of double-entendres and out-of-place pop-culture references. Young children will doubtless find the tale amusing, but overall the film has too much harebrained humor and not enough heart to entertain anyone else.

A man lies on his back, watching the sky and daydreaming about escape from the dreary stasis of his past, present, and future. This simple—and simplistic—image is a recurring one in “Crime: Stories,” a new anthology by German defense attorney Ferdinand von Schirach translated by Carol Brown Janeway. It is the key to understanding the author’s sensitive portrayals of the malefactors that populate his pages. Each of the stories in this slender volume approaches a different facet of human vice; in economical, if occasionally clunky, prose, von Schirach introduces readers to murderers, prostitutes, bank robbers, and a destroyer of fine art. To combine this darkly fascinating subject matter with the author’s straightforward narration initially seems a kind of alchemy; von Schirach promises to extract insights about “human beings—their failings, their guilt, and their capacity to behave magnificently” from the elements of hardboiled detective novels and television serials.
Perhaps it is von Schirach’s background in law that prevents “Crime” from realizing its high literary ambitions. Although he often speculates on his characters’ feelings and motives, he is ultimately reluctant to pass judgment by endowing his stories with broader significance, and it is impossible to derive much substance from his harrowing anecdotes beyond platitudes about the inscrutability of human nature. There are many opportunities for the collection to transcend its roots in popular fiction and true crime reporting, but von Schirach does not follow through on any of them.
Each story is narrated in the first person by a defense attorney, presumably von Schirach himself, and this fictional double has the potential to add a level of formal sophistication to von Schirach’s simple prose. But von Schirach wastes the opportunity by playing it straight, effacing the role of the narrator as much as possible and never exploring this conceit’s potential to offer insights on guilt, innocence, fate, and the meaning of truth—all concepts the author proclaims he will address in the preface of “Crime.”
Nevertheless, von Schirach’s explorations of criminal psychology are riveting. The prose in these passages is direct and deliberate, and his imaginative, empathetic recreations of his clients’ thoughts enrich their narratives, adding emotional weight to plots that would otherwise lack meaning and sophistication. The opening pages of “The Thorn” trace the development of a museum security guard’s psychosis with such restraint that his bizarre actions seem like a plainly logical result of his circumstances.
Of course, von Schirach often turns to this explanation for his clients’ behavior—that they are victims of circumstance—when his clever legal maneuvering is not enough to acquit them. Each perpetrator in “Crime” is introduced with an elaborate backstory that explains his or her criminal inclinations. These accounts occasionally feel perfunctory; when a young Eastern European woman becomes a prostitute in Berlin, von Schirach reveals that she fled her village after being raped by soldiers fighting an unspecified war. The vagueness and brevity of her history—we never even learn the name of her home country—is not only careless but disappointing. Anyone could have inferred such an environment for an Eastern European prostitute working in Germany; neither the backstory nor the straightforward, prosaic style in which von Schirach spells it out add anything to that story or the collection as a whole.
Despite the occasional lapse into negligence, though, von Schirach’s ‘members of the underworld’ are engaging, relatable, and often endearing—even if they never transcend their origins as stock characters masked by quirky flourishes, like a head injury that leaves a Greek cocaine dealer convinced he is from Finland. Unfortunately, von Schirach is rarely able to endow his other characters—generally victims and employees of the judicial system—with such charisma. He spends half a page listing the features of a homicide detective’s office, noting that “the decor is practical and light gray, the rooms are too cramped, the chairs are too ergonomic, and on the windowsills are plastic-looking plants with self-irrigating pebble trays.” The description does little to develop the characterization of the man to whom the office belongs, and it seems that von Schirach subscribes to the fallacy that the accumulation of small details, no matter what they are, is a shortcut to realism.
One of the primary virtues of the television crime procedurals that seem to have inspired von Schirach is their self-containment. Comprehending the plot arc of an individual episode of “Law & Order” does not require knowledge of other episodes, or, for that matter, of the show at all. Similarly, the stories in “Crime” do not inform each other in any meaningful way; despite the recurrence of von Schirach’s character and certain images and situations, this collection is nothing more than the sum of its parts. This need not be a problem—a collection of stories that are compelling and well-crafted enough to stand on their own is as pleasurable as any story cycle. Yet many of von Schirach’s breathless, plot-driven pieces are too slight to be read alone. He occasionally adds a symbolic-seeming image, like an apple, to his stories, or flirts with their philosophical implications. He pauses at one point to ponder about a bank robber, “Had he not done what all of us are capable of? Would we have behaved differently if we had found ourselves in his place?” And yet he never explores these symbols and musings far enough to say anything original. One is left hoping that they will be expanded upon elsewhere—only to be disappointed.
Abbas, a Palestinian refugee, is one of the many desperate dreamers in “Crime.” He is introduced like many of the others, “lay[ing] down on the clay of his unpaved street and [trying] to count the hopeless tangle of power lines and phone lines that were slung between the houses and carved up the sky.” Indeed, his life itself is fragmented, ‘carved up’ by poverty and bad luck beyond any hope of meaning or substantial achievement. It is a shame that such a clear parallel can be drawn with von Schirach’s anthology.

“The art of writing history is ... making an argument by writing a story,” said Jill Lepore, a Harvard professor of American history, in a talk at the Barker Center on Monday about historical writing. To the layperson, the idea that writing history is an art may seem contrary to memories of dull textbooks or sensationalist popular history books. But Lepore—academic, journalist, and novelist—managed to dispel that notion with her first few clear, well-chosen words. She described herself as having a “very obsessive relationship with writing,” adding that she’s “not in control of it, but instead possessed by it.”
For someone who claims to not have control over her writing, Lepore articulated a clear definition of what makes nonfiction compelling. She believes that “if [the author] could ‘smuggle’ a historian’s argument in a story past someone who wasn’t looking for it,” he or she has written a successful history book. Recalling her early love of writing, Lepore said that she “wrote lots of stories” but, unlike other nonfiction authors, she is “now an academic, not a failed novelist.” She does not avoid fiction because she does not want to write it—she recently co-authored the novel “Blindspot” with her friend Jane Kamensky—but because “fiction seems like an indulgence when one has so many other obligations.”
Professor Lepore sees herself as a public historian who “has a civic obligation to contribute to the public debate, not just [to] be  ... entertaining.” Obeying that same sense of duty, Lepore became a Reserve Officers’ Training Corps cadet in college; her concern for the public sphere has led her to investigate the Tea Party in her recent work. “Political philosophy is disguised as history,” she said, “and then [the Tea Party] declaim academic historians as wrong, so there is no way to win against their circular thinking.” According to Lepore, many Tea Party members believe “that the Tea Party has the ‘true’ notion of American history, and that historical record ... has been hijacked by the left. Historians and academics are conspirators and places like Harvard are viewed as the ‘elite’ enemy.”
She also decried the conservative and the mainstream media, saying that “the editor has disappeared from much of today’s writing process. Much of what you hear has never been fact-checked.” Although she sees it as her civic duty to write about current politics, Lepore does not advocate indiscriminate historical writing. She is saddened by the fact that “for the most part, yes, today historians are expected to comment on the present. When the swine flu craziness began, my editor asked if I would write a book about the Spanish Influenza of 1918.” Lepore reminded her audience that not all those who are asked to compare history with the present are even historians. According to Lepore, “most ‘analysts’ on TV and the public eye are just journalists masquerading as historians. They traffic in false analogy as entertainment.”
For her latest book, “The Whites of Their Eyes: The Tea Party’s Revolution and the Battle Over American History,” Lepore pursued the challenge of addressing contemporary politics. She said that she changed her focus from history to the present because “after Scott Brown won in January 2010, we all knew that the Tea Party was more than just a quick craze.” She added that her research for the book was not just the product of a historian covering a present event—it felt personal. She said that she “come[s] from people of the Tea Party,” and their culture reminds her of her “own family at Thanksgiving or Christmas.”
More frightening to Lepore is her instinct that the Tea Party represents “a dangerous way of thinking ... an increase in fanaticism.” As a historian, she said, one notices that “American politics are characterized by a paranoid style.” But what has changed in “the paranoid style is that now [the rhetoric of] good and evil infects it.” Discussing the media’s reactions to last month’s shooting in Tucson, Ariz., Lepore suggested that history is often appropriated by non-experts to make political points, but “academic historians are needed to weigh in on the connection between political violence and political rhetoric.” After all, history does tend to repeat itself.

With a flawed script and stereotypical storyline, Kevin Macdonald’s “The Eagle” rarely rises above mediocrity. Despite being buoyed by quality cinematography and a decent musical score—necessities for any would-be war epic—the film is marred by poor acting and the narrow emotional range of lead actor Channing Tatum. His utter lack of presence dooms “The Eagle” to B-movie status, and gives the film the feel of a melodramatic high school production.
Resurrected by screenwriter Jeremy Brock from 1954 Rosemary Sufcliff novel “The Eagle of the Ninth,” the film’s story follows the adventures of Roman centurion Marcus Aquila (Channing Tatum). Alongside his British slave Esca (Jamie Bell), Aquila endeavors to regain his family’s honor by retrieving a treasured eagle standard from the treacherous lands of southern Britain, and to discern what became of the standard-carrying legion—led by Aquila’s father—that disappeared in the region 20 years before. The quest tests the relationship of master and slave and the limits of the partners’ loyalty to each other.
Left within his traditional action comfort zone, Tatum (“G.I. Joe,” “Stop-Loss”) ably shows off his buff physique and athleticism in the film’s numerous combat scenes, but he lacks the acting muscles necessary to portray Aquila’s actual persona. Throughout “The Eagle,” Tatum appears awkwardly disengaged from the dramatic tension of the film, acting as the same mindless character who inhabits the film’s mindless action scenes. The supporting cast offers little relief, thanks to surprisingly subpar performances from usually dependable veterans Donald Sutherland (Aquila’s uncle) and Denis O’Hare (Lutorius, Aquila’s second-in-command).
To be fair, these poor showings may be attributable to the screenwriting. The film’s characters possess incongruously modern vocabularies and oddly American accents for ancient Rome—except for Tatum, who adopts a strange English-Spanish affectation. Lines like “Come on, put your thumbs up!” yelled to a crowd fail to complement the epic Old World vibes that the cinematography and musical score work so hard to develop. And when the film does attempt to evoke a historical sensibility, it does so with unnecessary official titles and ornate Roman greetings which are spoken so quickly that their meanings are almost impossible to decipher.
Despite the shoddy script, up-and-coming Scottish actor Jamie Bell shines in his role as Esca. Tasked with portraying a nuanced character—a man with good reason to both respect and resent his master—Bell displays a difficult range of emotions, from vengeful grief to fatherly tenderness, and holds the spotlight even as a subservient slave. Bell’s finesse allows him to compensate for Tatum’s poor performance and create a convincing portrayal of authentic camaraderie between the two characters.
The film and its crew also deserve credit for its cinematography and choice of locations. Director Macdonald does a superb job of juxtaposing his ample number of close-up shots with broad scenic sweeps; through these “The Eagle” skillfully showcases the dynamic beauty of the Scottish highlands and Hungarian countryside. Macdonald’s past experience with documentary filmmaking is reflected both in the film’s gorgeous landscapes and in the variety and originality of camera angles it employs to illustrate the subtleties of Tatum’s and Bell’s friendship.
With his score, Icelandic film composer Atil Örvarsson accomplishes a feat comparable to that of Macdonald’s cinematography. After working on “Iron Man” and “Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End,” Örvarsson brings his experience in comic epic to the serious and dramatic tones of “The Eagle.” His score—while similar at times to those of his previous films—is refreshing. Its careful balance of simple solos and complex orchestral dynamics enhances the film without overwhelming the audience’s auditory senses with instrumental ballast. The synergy of cinematography and musical effects is especially effective in evoking the simmering ferocity of the Roman legions—and makes one wish there were performances and dialogue to accompany the aural and visual landscapes.
In the end, though cinematography and musical backdrop provide the epic atmosphere for an impressive Roman adventure, the film’s generally substandard acting and a flawed, unoriginal script fail to fill the vast expanse painted on the screen. The film thus presents more as a National Geographic feature with mildly gory action than as a hero’s meaningful journey through danger and wilderness to find honor and redemption. “The Eagle” is all style and too little substance.

There’s really only one thing that you can expect from an Adam Sandler movie: potty humor. Dennis Dugan’s “Just Go With It” certainly delivers that—plus a number of other quirks that border on the impressively absurd, even for a Sandler flick.
Sandler plays Danny Maccabee—Jewish characters being another Sandler staple—a plastic surgeon whose past encounter with heartbreak has turned him from an honest, charming dork into a rather manipulative womanizer. When Danny finds himself smitten by an adorable schoolteacher Palmer (Brooklyn Decker), he ends up constructing a fake ex-family to try and win her over. He enlists his loyal assistant Katherine (Jennifer Aniston) to pose as his soon-to-be ex-wife. Katherine herself is a single mom, and before she knows it, Danny has embroiled her kids in his web of lies, and the whole group is off to Hawaii for a weekend to remember.
If the plot sounds almost arbitrary, that’s because it is. The movie presents a string of random and semi-amusing events that don’t pretend to be anything remotely resembling a logical story progression. “Just Go With It” is aiming for chuckles, not coherence.
In Hawaii, Katherine’s children carry a significant amount of the film’s weight. Michael (Griffin Gluck) is a shy but bold six-year-old, and Gluck manages to project an amusing combination of cuteness and intimidation. His older sister Maggie (Bailee Madison of “Brothers”) is an eccentric, wannabe actress with a flair for the dramatic. These well-realized performances by relative unknowns provide much of the charm of the film, and leave surprisingly little pressure on the shoulders of its older co-stars.
In “Just Go With It,” Aniston plays somewhat against type, with a role that is a bit more slapstick than much of her prior work. As Katherine, the overworked divorcée who hasn’t worn heels in years, she does more with physical humor than with dialogue—from crotch-punching and hula-dancing to swan-diving and swimsuit-modeling—to hold the audience’s attention. In this fashion, Aniston’s usual girl-next-door charm is replaced by a badass attitude and some straightforward sex appeal. Sandler, on the other hand, plays the same character viewers have come to expect, from the scatological humor to the on-the-nose physical comedy.
The most unexpected performance in “Just Go With It” is undoubtedly that of Nicole Kidman, who plays dramatically against her traditional Hollywood persona. As Aniston’s ditzy ex-sorority sister, Devlin, she appears in four lengthy scenes of obsessive nose-nuzzling and serious hip-shaking. While it’s hard to judge the quality of the act, this is definitely a Kidman audiences have never seen before, and the performance does grab one’s attention; whether or not it’s the perverse appeal of watching a train wreck in progress is for the individual viewer to decide.
Though it would be the understatement of the century to call the film’s ending predictable—guess who ends up falling in love with whom!—writers Allan Loeb and Timothy Dowling pull off the expected with some surprisingly adept romantic dialogue. Of course, this sensitivity is balanced out by some of the script’s slightly racist and sexually offensive segments, which include everything from a incompetent Latina babysitter to a flamboyant gay hairdresser.
For Sandler fans who enjoy the likes of “Click” and “Mr. Deeds,” “Just Go With It” will not disappoint; as far as Sandler movies go, it’s safe to call this one a success. At the same time, for those who eschew slapstick, no review is really needed to suggest that this film will most likely bore and offend more refined cinematic sensibilities. “Just Go With It” is, in other words, just what one would expect.

“It’s like bringing flowers to your mama and tracking dog shit all over the floor: Jesus made the flowers but it took a dog to make the story good.” Nothing better illustrates the Drive-by Trucker’s perfect dichotomy of traditional country styles and tongue-in-cheek humor than this line from “Cartoon Gold.” Their new album “Go-Go Boots” is equal parts warbling, banjo strumming, oddball one-liners, and self-mockery. Their careful blend of traditional southern rock and country tropes with a typically alt-rock self-awareness makes this a universally accessible—and remarkably enjoyable—album.
The musicianship throughout the entire album is remarkably tight. While notable, the band’s technical harmony is not completely surprising since founding members Patterson Hood and Mike Cooley have been together since the late ’80s, playing in a good number of bands before forming the Truckers in 1996. Although the lineup has changed over the years, Drive-by Truckers have steadily continued to put out their own brand of southern rock.
“Go-Go Boots,” however, marks a distinct change from earlier releases like 2008’s acclaimed “Brighter Than Creation’s Dark,” which included uplifting tracks like “Daddy Needs a Drink” and “You and Your Crystal Meth.” The new album, while still tackling the same dejected characters, has a much lighter touch, adding sarcasm to the depressive mix. This is evident in “The Thanksgiving Filter:” in the midst of singing about an unfortunate family gathering, the vocalist abruptly states “I sure wish I’d smoked me a joint.”
“Assholes” epitomizes the Truckers’ particular talent for subverting the conventions of their particular genre of music—the song has an evident country feel, but functions in a wholly different way. It offers what could be construed as an unapologetic response to a lot of today’s female country stars, who spend entire albums lamenting the wrongs they have suffered at the hands of men. In “Assholes,” the singer addresses someone, presumably an ex-girlfriend, explaining his position as an asshole, rather than denying his own actions. The juxtaposition between the country feel of the song and the Truckers’ bold self-awareness and lyrical maturity makes the band not quite country, and not quite alternative—they have a style all their own.
Despite their tendencies toward satire, the Truckers are capable of putting out conventionally appealing songs. “Go-Go Boots” opens with “I Do Believe,” a melodic track replete with smooth vocals and gentle guitars—just the right ingredients for nostalgia-inducing comfort rock. Since “I Do Believe” lacks the kind of sarcastic indulgences that appear throughout most of the album, it is easily the most mainstream, radio-friendly track on the album. Though “I Do Believe” is a much simpler song musically and lyrically than most others on the album, it still has an element of catchiness that makes even the Truckers’ most traditionally mainstream songs nuanced and enjoyable. However, they do not stray too far into overly-traditional music, and it is telling that a song called “Everybody Needs Love” is followed by “Assholes.”
On the other side of the album’s tonal and thematic spectrum are songs like “Used to Be a Cop,” a tragi-comic narrative of corruption and loss, and “The Fireplace Poker,” a downtrodden account of a murderous reverend. Both songs stretch past seven minutes and are cleverly crafted musical vignettes, harking back to the narrative structure of an old country ballad—a structure now in vogue with bands like the Hold Steady and the Decemberists.
Because the album has three vocalists that rotate from song to song, “Go-Go Boots” does not have a particularly unified feel. Sampling the styles of each vocalist keeps the album exciting, but some of the vocalists are not as compelling as others. The tracks on which female vocalists appear are markedly less self-aware than the male-led tracks, and this shift in tone detracts from the album’s continuity. “Dancin’ Ricky” is excessively hokey, recalling the worst kind of country schlock. Their cover of Eddie Hinton’s “Where’s Eddie,” although it features a more pleasantly restrained vocalist, is equally out of place on the album with its overly simplistic lyrics. The songs on which Hood or Cooley appear as vocalists fit the Truckers’ aesthetic much better, keeping their sarcastic yet honest tone intact.
The Drive-by Truckers understand that while the modern trends in country music may not make for particularly engaging albums, there’s still life in old forms. They remain compelling due to their ability to laugh at themselves and tell some odd stories in the process. It may take skilled musicianship to reel in music snobs, but it takes a good story to make them stay.

En route from the United Kingdom to the Philippines and Japan, the Tierney Sutton Band made a stop to grace the stage of Sanders Theatre last Friday—a prelude to a celebration of 40 years of jazz at Harvard presented by the Office of Arts at Harvard (OFA). Last Thursday, preceding their Friday night concert, the Tierney Sutton Band and their eponymous vocalist led a small master class in the New College Theatre for several Harvard undergraduates and other jazz admirers. This Harvard master class and public performance represented a joint collaboration between the OFA and the Celebrity Series of Boston. During their visit to campus, the Tierney Sutton Band performed some of their hit songs while sharing their distinct jazz philosophy.
In her master class, Tierney Sutton incorporated her voice as another instrument in her jazz ensemble, never once considering herself as above the talents of her instrumentalists. This attitude was embodied to the fullest at Sanders Theatre on Friday evening—the band’s cooperation showing itself brilliantly in their performance.
Throughout the evening, vocalist Tierney Sutton, pianist Christian Jacob, bassist Kevin Axt, and drummer Ray Brinker sat within arms reach of each other, embodying their philosophy of playing with rather than next to each other, as well as representing over seventeen years of arranging together. Though the ensemble was small, they had no trouble filling Sanders’ large performance space.
The performance was in all respects a beautiful collaboration. Sutton’s versatile solo in the band’s second piece gradually softened and receded into the heart of the instrumentalists’ rising melody, but her body language nevertheless expressed her continued participation with the band. Each musician had several moments during the performance to shine, with the band exploring nearly every combination of solo and group melodies. 
A somewhat unusual development during the band’s performance was a series of jazz pieces addressing the less romantic aspects of love: an odd contrast to February’s Valentine’s Day and the band’s positive stories from their nearly two-decade working relationship. However, the evening’s tone lightened toward the end of the show with upbeat rhythms and whimsical lyricality. Rarely did Sutton miss an opportunity to express her admiration and appreciation for her fellow band members, insisting that, in her opinion, they are truly among the very best jazz instrumentalists in the world. 
The Tierney Sutton Band performed at Sanders Theatre at the invitation of The Celebrity Series of Boston—whose staff contacted Harvard’s Learning From Performers Program Manager Thomas S. Lee about the idea of a Harvard master class on jazz performance. “I jumped at the chance because … we’ve done a lot of work with jazz artists over the years [but] haven’t had many jazz vocalists—that was something that really appealed to me,” Lee said. 
Lee invited several Harvard undergraduate jazz musicians to participate in the Thursday evening master class. Upstairs in the New College Theatre, Sutton and the band explained their philosophy behind jazz performance as well as some of their techniques and methods for playing together. Between each piece played by the undergraduate ensemble, the visiting artists offered their advice on how jazz ensembles can collaborate. 
“I really appreciated how she allowed herself to immerse herself in the rest of the band”, said Andrew S. Kennard ’13. “I got a different take about what it means to play with a vocalist. They play as a unit. It was a different perspective.”
Although the two jazz ensembles only had a limited amount of time to play together, student vocalist Samara R. Oster ’13 described how their evening together gave her a chance to reflect on her own jazz style. “I think the different things she brought to the master class, talking about pitch and dynamic … helped me take into consideration [what] I wanted to take from her advice and put into my singing regularly,” Oster said. 
The Tierney Sutton Band’s visit to campus comes just a few months ahead of the OFA’s “40 Years of Jazz at Harvard: A Celebration” from April 7-10. The OFA will host the return of previous visiting jazz musicians for three days of commemoration, conversation, and music. Collaborating with the OFA to bring students and jazz musicians together, the Tierney Sutton Band has prepared Harvard for a celebration that is a part of a growing history of honoring jazz on Harvard’s campus.

No longer known as “Sportfuck,” Asobi Seksu—Japanese for “playful sex”—have a more timid and suitable name that perfectly encompasses the informal sensuality of their sound. On “Fluorescence,” the fourth full-length release from the New York City shoegaze band, Asobi Seksu offers a phosphorescent sonic ocean of catchy dream-pop tunes, which are infused with a splash of karaoke and Japanese pop-punk. Though the songs can feel unfocused and incoherent, the afterglow of the album’s playful mess of heavy production and strong pop moments makes it one of the group’s stronger releases.
At its core, this is a bedroom album with a stadium soul. However, Asobi Seksu’s swelling waves of sound, replete with smudged vocals and howling distortion, weaken the impact of songs like “In My Head” and “Ocean.” The least substantive tracks exemplify the drawbacks of the unrelenting sounds—which can render them claustrophobic—and vocalist Yuki Chikudate’s occasionally tenuous vocals often get lost in the tidal pull of distorted guitars and over-produced keyboards.
“Trails,” the second track and lead single, is a haunting elegy punctuated by pop choruses. What begins as a dirge of low drones, dissonant guitar buzz, and swerving vocals dissolves into a sparkling and ebullient close. Chikudate is at her best here, using her entire range: the soulful diva, the ethereal angel, the no-nonsense frontwoman, and the childlike enchantress. This is also one of the rare occasions on the album when lyrics are featured aggressively enough to be heard over the wooly blanket of distorted instruments, and this lends the song a  focus the others lack.
Though the vocals are frequently obscured by the instrumentals, Asobi Seksu can be enjoyed for the sound alone. Words don’t seem to matter much, and the reverberating electronic glisses and mumbled or elided lyrics make listening to “Fluorescence” a lot like listening to ambient remixes of pop-rock anthems. In fact, the penultimate track, “Trance Out”—one of the strongest on the album and a nod to Japanese girly pop-punk—is sung in Japanese. With shimmering tambourine, light yet insistent drumming, and a driving bass, “Trance Out” captures the essence of anthemic rock while clearly remaining hazy dream pop. As demonstrated by the song’s success, understanding the lyrics is not necessary to appreciating Asobi Seksu.
This is why it doesn’t seem out of place when the band makes forays into progressive rock territory with primarily instrumental tracks like as the short interlude “Deep Weird Sleep” and “Leave the Drummer Out There”—a nearly seven-minute long sonic maze featuring searing guitar solos and several unexpected rhythmic and atmospheric shifts. These songs, as with many on the album, can be seen as indulgent and unengaging, but as with all the songs, they are embroidered with beautifully intricate sounds which necessitate repeated plays.
As minute moments of pleasure and aural excitement build in “Fluorescence,” occasional weaknesses like the unfocused, overdone production can also be construed as strengths. In the somnambulant “Pink Light,” Asobi Seksu’s shoegazing tendencies are at their finest. The distortion is slightly more focused, but still fuzzy enough to be warm and infinitely soothing. The lyrics are sung softly like a perfect dream-pop lullaby, and mellow but steady drums and bass perfectly evoke the “seas of pink light” of which Chikudate sings. Ultimately, these moments of luminosity make the album.
Fluorescence succeeds in balancing its fogged sonic landscapes with moments of pitch-perfect pop. At times the haze obscures the overall direction and experience of the tracks while there remain pinpoints of musical brilliance and clarity that draw the listener back in. At best, the clouds of noise and opacity work in favor of Asobi Seksu’s slightly aloof shoegaze project: when it comes to Asobi Seksu, a lack of focus can be a good thing.

Today is Conor Oberst’s 31st birthday. That he would release his new album, “The People’s Key,” on his birthday is appropriate—he’s been growing up in the public spotlight for the past 13 years. What’s been very clear throughout that time is that growing up has not been easy for Oberst. He began his career as little more than an emo kid screaming his diary entries over rudimentary guitar playing and drum-machine loops. Between 1998 and 2005, he developed his musical talents, but his songwriting remained resolutely immature. After 2005 he seemed to lose identity, struggling with communicating in a mature but still evocative way. This struggle culminated in two enjoyable, but thoroughly uninspiring albums released under his own name rather than the Bright Eyes moniker.
For “The People’s Key,” however, Oberst chose to once again release as Bright Eyes, and the decision points to an artistic vision. Oberst has returned to what he is best at: communicating inner doubts and fears over a diverse and shifting soundtrack. At 30, Oberst finally seems to have found a comfortable, grown-up sound and message. He’s still full of doubt, but he communicates that doubt in a way he has not managed in the last six years. In “The People’s Key” he creates a thrilling album that will delight the audience that has grown up with him.
In typical Bright Eyes style, the lyrical focus is on inner confusion. Lead single “Shell Games” contains classic Oberst lyrics, but they are delivered with a concision he has not always achieved. The song has broad themes, including references to “the arbiter” and “the architect” that continue Oberst’s perpetual struggles with religion. Yet, unlike some of his recent tracks that felt more vague, “Shell Games” focuses on the first person and how Oberst himself feels. “I’m still angry with no reason to be,” he sings, succinctly expressing the angst from which he has never been able to escape. The complexity of Oberst has always driven Bright Eyes’ success, and Oberst seems to have realized that there is no need to shy away from the kind of personal storytelling that some detractors might harshly label as trite.
Oberst’s sharp tongue is prominently featured on the new album. On the beautiful but edgy “Beginner’s Mind,” he implores, “Swear you’ll do the opposite / Of all those tangled hypocrites.” On “Triple Spiral” Oberst strongly recalls his earlier emo days, singing “That’s the problem, an empty sky / I fill it up with everything that’s missing from my life.” He’s mature enough now, however, not to overwhelm his songs with this sort of line. Instead he balances them out with other lyrical motifs, including Rastafarianism. This is particularly clear on “Heile Selassie,” named after the Ethiopian emperor who is a key figure in that religion. Despite the occasional bitterness of the album, that track sees a more hopeful future emerging from inside: “You got a soul, use it / All this despair forgiven.”
The expert pacing and concision of the album demonstrate a new talent for Oberst. Whereas some earlier records continued well past an hour, “The People’s Key” clocks in at a pleasantly controlled 47 minutes. Within, the songs are superbly sequenced and varied. Punkish cuts “Jejune Stars” and “Triple Spiral” are some of his most energetic recordings in years, but ballads like “Approximate Sunlight” and “Ladder Song” prevent the pace of the music from obscuring the fact that this is ultimately an introspective, lyric-driven record.
Within songs, Oberst has a deft touch for throwing out intriguing and sometimes exhilarating surprises. The bridge of “Shell Games” demonstrates an unprecedentedly inventive level of composition, with a whirling synth line emerging to carry the song into some kind of 1980s wonderland. However, the final chorus does not quite carry on the bridge’s momentum. A slight lack of polish is evident at various points in the album, and spending a little more time on a few songs might have pushed them to an even higher level.
Oberst has suggested in past interviews—although not recently—that he might retire the Bright Eyes name after this album. With any luck, the success of “The People’s Key” will convince him to reconsider. Oberst revels in associating himself with the name that made him famous, crafting an album entirely consistent with his past while demonstrating an impressive development of his core ideas. At 31 years old, Oberst still has the potential to release many great Bright Eyes albums. Hopefully, he will be willing to do so.

The musical number that best epitomizes “Kashmir If You Can,” the 163rd production by the Hasty Pudding Theatricals (HPT), is “Men On Top:” an intensely un-PC, sexually-charged tune about the merits of male dominance earnestly sung by a trio of women—or rather, in HPT tradition, men in drag. The show, which runs through March 6 in the New College Theatre, spares no targets or social mores with its biting comedy, and the result is one of the most entertaining shows to grace Harvard’s campus this year. As the plot thread becomes steadily more tenuous during the second act, “Kashmir If You Can” is more than ably held together by a talented cast and the inspired comic stylings of the writing staff.
“Kashmir If You Can,” as the tightly-executed opening number “Up In Smoke” informs the audience, is the tale of a motley crew of characters in India who are currently dealing with the fallout from the Maharajah’s (Aseem A. Shukla ’11) murder. Into the power vacuum steps Queen Latikah (Ethan D. Hardy ’14), his former wife, who attempts to seize control along with her lover, literal slumdog millionaire Pooch Yermoneywhereyourmouthis (Matthew J. DaSilva ’12). Meanwhile, a rather strange bunch—including the Queen’s daughter Sari M. Notsari (Benjamin K. Moss ’13), governess Cherry Poppins (Brandon J. Ortiz ’12) and a memory-challenged British detective (Jonathan P. Finn-Gamino ’12)—attempt to solve the mystery of the Maharajah’s murder and prevent the Queen from placing the people of India under her authoritarian rule.
At least for the more coherent first act, long-time HPT director Tony Parise adeptly juggles these overlapping storylines. In a show that must not only balance the demands of these varying characters but also provide a constant stream of jokes, however, a large part of the credit for the success of “Kashmir If You Can” must go to the writers, Gus T. Hickey ’11 and David J. “DJ” Smolinsky ’11. As the story dashes haphazardly between several subplots, romances, and an entirely irrelevant song about threesomes, the writing remains consistently funny; the script is packed with double-entendres, bad puns, and cheap pop-culture cracks in astonishing density. Lines like “I don’t see any virgins here—am I at Wellesley?” and “Are you having second thoughts? Because you rarely have first thoughts, so this is a big step for you!” have the audience in nearly constant stitches. Of course, many of the jokes are throwaways—“OMG ... Oh my Ganesha!”—but the cast delivers each line with such panache that even the silliest moments are effective.
The ensemble performs their multifaceted duties with remarkable professionalism. Singing, dancing, and verbal and physical comedy are equally emphasized, and equally well-realized, a major accomplishment for any production. Perhaps the best example of this synthesis is the self-censor-deficient Cherry Poppins, who sings about losing her virginity and delivers lines like “something isn’t sitting right with me either ... probably my inflamed hemorrhoids” entirely straight-faced. Queen Latikah combines her devilish schemes with grotesquely exaggerated facial expressions. Her daughter’s low-class lover Kareem Inyourpants (Ryan P. Halprin ’12) complements earnest silliness with a clear, strong singing voice, with which he croons in the title number, “We can leave without a trace / We’ll be undercover like an Arab girl’s face.” For all these talents, however, “Kashmir If You Can” is held together primarily by the cast’s supreme confidence and enthusiasm, without which the whole show would collapse under the weight of its utter ridiculousness.
Not all stereotypes are created equal, however, and a couple of secondary characters fall a bit flat. Pooch Yermoneywhereyourmouthis is limited mostly to weak canine jokes—though he does have an excellent rap sequence—and an Elvis-impersonating Vishnu (Jonathan K. Stevens ’14) feels tired. This is no fault of the actors, who throw themselves into the roles with abandon, but the increasing prominence of these characters as “Kashmir If You Can” progresses contributes to the lagging second act.
Other factors also play a role in the show’s loss of focus. The proliferation of subplots, including a romance between the British detective and Cherry Poppins and Vishnu’s quest to get his ‘mojo’ back, scatters the storyline. The audience is dragged from scene to unrelated scene with little explanation—hardly a fatal flaw for an absurdist comedy, but disorienting nonetheless. The writers eventually embrace the chaos, and in classic HPT style the show ends with an impeccably choreographed kickline featuring the entire cast. Thankfully, the high-quality acting and still-plentiful jokes keep the show from degenerating too far.
Supported by a very competent orchestra and elaborate, frequently changing backdrops, the cast carries “Kashmir If You Can” to impressive comic heights. With catchy tunes like “Pop the Question”—in which Cherry tells her detective lover she will “get down on both knees so [he’ll] get down on one”—thrown into the mix, “Kashmir If You Can” is a hard proposition to resist.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Paramount Pictures and the Berklee College of Music are nearing the completion of a mammoth collaborative process–the cataloging of every movie score from every Paramount film released since the 1920s. Debra Gelinas, Director of the Office of Experiential Learning at Berklee and a chief organizer of the program, estimated that the project contains “hundreds of thousands of minutes of music,” and said that Berklee had “never done a project on this scale before.”
Berklee film music professor Richard Davis was essential in instigating the massive undertaking. Paramount was deciding between several film music programs—including those at the University of Southern California, the University of California, Los Angeles, and Berklee; ultimately, only Berklee was chosen for the program. Once in touch with Berklee, Paramount chose a group of 40 of the brightest Berklee film-scoring students who would then use their expertise in music production and composition to assign search tags and key terms to every cue—music for one scene—in the Paramount music archive. Directors and producers can then search for these key terms in the archive to find cues suitable for use in their films. For instance, a director in need of a ‘thrilling’ yet ‘humorous’ cue can search for these tags in the database and come across a few cues that Berklee interns also classified as ‘thrilling or ‘humorous’. After coming to a licensing agreement with Paramount, the director can use these tracks in his or her film.
Although the database clearly helps Paramount organize and license their music, it also helps the Berklee students interning with the project. Professor Davis claimed that cataloging the archive offers the students “access to vast amounts of film music that are not readily available to the public.” By thoroughly studying these tracks the interns can further their understanding of the relationship between film and music. “I also learned a great deal about film music itself. The simplicity of music in a film becomes so easily apparent when you strip it away from the picture,” wrote Bryant J. Fuhrmann, a recent Berklee graduate and former intern for the project, by email.
As further compensation for their unpaid work, each intern was offered the opportunity to score an old short Paramount film to be displayed on the Paramount website. Such opportunities are rare but valuable experiences for aspiring film composers. Fuhrmann was assigned a Paramount cartoon from the ‘30s and began to correspond with Paramount executives about his work. The executives guided the interns through the process to yield a final product that suited the executives’ visions. Scoring the short film was, according to Fuhrmann, “three months of grueling work, that made me go nuts at times.” However, such hard work came with the invaluable experience that Professor Davis describes as working in a “situation that mirrors a professional environment.” Fuhrmann echoed such sentiments; he said that the program taught him “what life in the music industry could be like.”
Although the program seems to be promoting new film music, it also ironically seems to threaten the existence of film composers: its database could eliminate the need for directors to commission new film music. Fuhrmann, however, is not bothered. Invoking Igor Stravinsky, he said that “good musicians borrow, great musicians steal;” he claimed that he can undercut Paramount licensing fees by selling a track to a director that merely mimicks the style of a track in the database.
For success in the film music industry composers must be jacks-of-all-trades. They must be chameleons, able to easily reproduce and create in a variety of styles. Confident with this ability through his experience as an intern for Paramount and his degree from Berklee, Fuhrmann said he is ready to take on the tough and demanding life of a film composer. “I’m now a one stop shop as much as these cue libraries,” he said. “I’m not worried.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction.
CORRECTION: FEB. 21, 2011
The Feb. 15 article "Creating a Database of Paramount Music" incorrectly referred to the Berklee College of Music as the Berklee School of Music.

As the audience returns to their seats after intermission, seven actors in white bohemian attire—white linen pants, white shirts, and white sashes—race and push one another to take the six seats that comprise the orchestra, directly on the stage. The seventh, realizing he’s been left out, finally says “Act 4. Scene 1.” These quirky moments define the Actors’ Shakespeare Project’s witty and fast-paced production of “Cymbeline.”
Known as one of Shakespeare’s most confusing plays, “Cymbeline” is a story of thwarted love, mistaken identities, and fairy-tale potions and kingdoms. Due to its convoluted plot, it is even rumored that Shakespeare wrote “Cymbeline” for his own amusement. Director Doug Lockwood’s minimalist theme, however, effectively tones down the complexities that make “Cymbeline” a difficult, rarely-produced romance.
“Cymbeline,” the first of three plays in the Actors’ Shakespeare Project’s Winter Festival, runs until February 20. The performance takes place in The Storefront on Elm in Davis Square, a space previously occupied by vintage clothing store Poor Little Rich Girl. The company embraces the location, even transforming one of the dressing rooms into a barbaric cave in the middle of Wales. The all-white set is small and intimate, and is decorated by nothing but a few Persian rugs. Lockwood uses every trick in the book to simplify the play and get the audience to focus on the acting and experience what “Cymbeline” has to offer—and it works.
The production has a seven-person cast and almost 16 character changes—including one character, Cornelius, who is split between three actors—but the cast seem to alter personalities with ease. By simply moving his sash from his waist to his head, Posthumus (De’Lon Grant) morphs into both Cloten, the King’s irritating son, and Cornelius, the hilarious, accent-changing court physician. In this whirlwind of character changes, the plot is equally chaotic, taking the audience from Britain to Italy. King Cymbeline (Ken Baltin) imprisons his daughter Imogen (Brooke Hardman) for falling in love with Posthumus, who is himself banished to Italy. To make the story even more complex, Cymbeline has two kidnapped sons who have been raised in rural Wales by Belaria (Marya Lowry), the banished mistress of the King. Through a war between Italy and Britain, Posthumus seeks revenge for his banishment and attempts to reunite with Imogen.
The theater stays brightly-lit throughout the performance, illuminating the white set even further. At first, the effect is overwhelming, but when the cast enters with their white uniforms, the audience focuses on what truly matters: the acting. Lowry, who plays both the Queen and Belaria, is brilliant and subtle with well-timed sarcastic remarks and sexually empowering body language. Her seductive powers support an undeniable chemistry with the regal Baltin. Baltin himself, filling many roles, becomes Cymbeline as easily as he transitions into Cornelius, using a comedic cross between a Russian and Spanish accent to transform into the bold court doctor. Grant juxtaposes the masculine Posthumus with the flamboyant Cornelius with great energy and timing—he even uses instruments as weapons.
Lockwood’s simplistic approach fits well with the production’s unusual venue. Faint songs blaring from the bars in the neighborhood mix with the show’s makeshift music, consisting mostly of homemade instruments played by the actors themselves. The set does not have expensive light fixtures, smoke machines, or sound effects, but that is exactly the point—Lockwood’s aim is not to fool you. Rather, he asks the audience to take a journey with his ensemble, emphasizing storytelling above gimmickry.
In this case, the story is complex. While loose ends are still not tied at the end of the performance, Lockwood does Shakespeare justice with a quirky and unorthodox take on a story of love, malice, betrayal, and forgiveness.

Today, Radcliffe Institute Fellow John Tiffany will speak of theater that breaks fascinatingly from the traditional form. Tiffany, Associate Director of the National Theatre of Scotland, is the guest speaker in the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study’s Julia S. Phelps Annual Lecture in Art and the Humanities. His talk, entitled “Can We Keep Up? Theater’s Incredible Ability to Evolve,” will take place at 4 p.m. in the Radcliffe Gymnasium.
The National Theatre of Scotland is Tiffany’s case study in the evolution of theater and its potential for the future. “The lecture is going to be looking at the way theater ... evolve[s] out of buildings and stages and traditional theater forms, and how the National Theatre of Scotland has been doing in terms of this evolution. It is a new national theater company that’s been set up without a building—and that means a different take on the process,” said Tiffany.
Tiffany incorporates a deep love for Scotland into the more unstructured, less classical style of theater in his productions. His acclaimed production of “Black Watch,” a play about Scotland’s esteemed eponymous military regiment in the Iraq War that first opened at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 2006, is just one example of this modern Scottish flavor. 
“There’s something about Scottish theater that I especially love. It’s very musical and connected with vaudeville and a very working-class country—that shows in the art form. There’s a lot of movement, there’s a lot of heart. It’s very different from the more—how would you say it?—refined English theater,” Tiffany continued. 
Tiffany has worked to incorporate his contemporary Scottish style into more traditional works. One such effort was his adaptation of J.M. Barrie’s “Peter Pan.” “‘Peter Pan’ is the most famous Scottish play every written, but it’s not set in Scotland—it’s set in London. So the first thing I did was move it back to Edinburgh, and then I focused on Peter himself. I pulled him out of the Disney version and made him a lot darker, based on the god Pan, much more connected to the lands,” said Tiffany.
Tiffany believes that theater must not only evolve at the level of script writing, but also evoke a change in societal attitudes. “I get really down when I tell someone that I’m a theater director and [people] say, ‘I should go to the theater more often.’ I tell them, ‘no, you shouldn’t.’ No one ever says that they should play more ‘Grand Theft Auto.’ Rather than say society is terrible for not appreciating the theater enough, we should make the theater more interesting,” he said. 
Tiffany is currently investigating the use of the human voice in theater as a Radcliffe Fellow. In a project with the American Repertory Theater, Tiffany deals with dialects, voices, and how they affect people’s perceptions. His interest in the topic comes from an experience of his own.
“I was doing a project in London 10 years ago on the development of the English language. They brought in voice experts and one of them, Stanley Eveling ... told me within three minutes of speaking to me that my mom was from Lancashire and my dad was from Yorkshire.” Though Tiffany has devoted most of his adult life to the theater—an art heavily reliant on vocal mutability—his history was easily discerned. “For me, as someone who necessarily moved away from [my native] accent [to work] in the arts and then at university in Scotland ... it was incredibly emotional to discover that my accent was still there like vocal DNA,” he said. 
As far as his experience in Cambridge, Tiffany decided to take a sabbatical from the usual three to four trips to the theater he takes each week in Scotland. Instead, he has taken to seeing films every Sunday. “It seems to be a law that films have to be set in Boston: ‘The Social Network,’ ‘The Town,’ ‘The Company Men,’ ‘The Fighter.’ I feel like a Bostonian now,” he said.
There are some things, however, that make Tiffany miss home. “The thing I miss is [British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)] radio. I’m a huge [National Public Radio] fan—but the fundraisers!”
However receptive to modern American culture he may be, it seems Tiffany remains faithful to his work with the National Theatre of Scotland and his efforts to convey both Scottish tradition and modern life to audiences with flair.

Today’s museumgoers would barely blink at the sight of a tissue box or packing peanuts on display in an art gallery. Yet creative interpretations of found objects continue to inspire both artists and viewers by taking materials out of their normal contexts. In an exhibit entitled “Nobody needs to  know the price of your Saab,” currently on display at Boston’s Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA), artist Gabriel Kuri presents his unconventional combinations of found objects. At times, the creations are pleasantly surprising, yet often the assembled objects confuse viewers by communicating apparently inconsistent messages.
Born in Mexico in 1970, Kuri found a source of inspiration in his contemporary Gabriel Orozco, an artist who also explores the aesthetic potential of utilitarian objects in his work. In this particular selection of pieces displayed at the ICA, Kuri examines the material trail left by each consumer in the form of receipts, containers, bags, and refuse. Receipts are the artist’s dominant and most successfully employed material throughout the show; the diverse range of sculptural roles that these thin slips of commercial paper play is truly impressive.
For Kuri, transactions and the receipts they generate represent individual affirmations of the consumer’s habits, and as a group, they form a diary or record of his or her existence. Kuri has creatively repurposed hundreds of his own personal receipts; in several untitled collage works, the slips are superimposed onto weathered vintage advertisements, while in a piece titled “Column,” a huge stack of receipts is impaled on a floor-to-ceiling metal spindle. One of the most visually compelling pieces in the exhibit is a series called “Untitled—Superama I- III,” which is comprised of three intricate wall tapestries, each hand-woven by hired artisans from Guadalajara, Mexico. It depicts three sets of receipts from identical purchases made by the artist at a Mexican Walmart.
In these works, Kuri carefully avoids any condemnation of consumerism. His decision to commission monumental, handmade wall tapestries suggests that these records of our purchases, combined with the actual act of buying, should be documented and celebrated as part of our cultural tradition just like the art of weaving itself. Kuri promotes a similar embrace of consumer society with “Thank-You Clouds,” an installation which features clusters of plastic bags attached to the ceiling, inflated and buffeted about by nearby fans. The sculptures are both whimsical and delicate, and make no attempt to criticize the environmentally unfriendly process by which they were made. This lack of cultural condemnation proves refreshing, as it allows viewers to focus entirely on the intriguing visual forms before them.
However, this sense of indifference to environmental concerns does not hold true for every piece. In an untitled installation, Kuri constructs a conveyer belt modeled on the moving checkout counters found in supermarkets. An empty aluminum energy-drink can rolls across and continually bumps against the plastic edge of the belt with a metallic clanking sound. Though the piece strongly communicates an image of monotonous and wasteful consumption, it noticeably lacks the creative use of material which enlivens Kuri’s other sculptures. He simply transplants a common commercial device into the context of the gallery, but its new setting does not lend the piece any surprising, beautiful, or controversial qualities. Indeed, the belt functions just as it would in a supermarket, but with the added irritation of the rhythmically clanking drink can. While Kuri’s receipt pieces highlight their own visually interesting qualities, such as the orderly, mechanized format of the list and the luminous, translucent paper, the simple recreation of the ubiquitous checkout counter fails to be thought-provoking. In this way, Kuri is most successful when he avoids tired messages of environmental conservation, and instead focuses on the purely creative potential of his materials.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cellist Clare M.C. Whitehead ’12 is a chemistry concentrator in Kirkland House. This January, she was elected president of the Harvard- Radcliffe Orchestra.
The Harvard Crimson: How long have you been playing the cello?
Clare Whitehead: I have been playing the cello since I was in the fourth grade. An orchestra came to play at my school one day, and I just fell in love with the instrument. I promptly went home and asked my parents if I could play the cello. Well, I didn’t give them much of a choice. I loved it ever since.
THC: Can you tell me about your past involvement with the Harvard Radcliffe Orchestra?
CW: I auditioned for the orchestra in the fall of my freshman year. That same year, I also worked as a stage manager. It involved lots of physical labor, because I had to move a lot of chairs, but it was cool to be involved with the organization in a way other than playing, because I love the orchestra and the community as a whole. I worked as a stage manager for three semesters. During this time, I worked closely with the general manager, because I wanted to do something more. I then became the general manager. I find it really fun to do things for the orchestra. I just love the community so much.
THC: How has your role changed as president?
CW: Being president is a lot more responsibility. It involves overseeing every aspect of the orchestra’s practices and performances. This can get tricky because there are between 80 and 100 member in the orchestra. We have two other elected positions: general manager and finance manager. There are various other appointed officers who make sure that certain aspects of the orchestra run smoothly. Every week, the operations committee meets once a week so that we can keep each other updated.
THC: Do the members of the orchestra ever attend social events together when they’re not practicing or playing?
CW: Our social chairs usually create opportunities for the members to socialize. However, in the fall, all members must attend a music camp in Greenwood, Massachusetts. We learn to play music and hang out with each other, and it’s really fun. The camp helps us strengthen our community. More recently, the orchestra sponsored a laser tag event over Optional Winter Activities Week which was open to the whole student body. I was surprised because there was such a large turnout. I guess people really like to play laser tag.
THC: Will you continue to play the cello after you graduate?
CW: Music is so much fun, and such a huge part of my life. If I had a chance to play in an orchestra after I graduate, then I would love to.
THC: Have you considered playing any other instruments in the orchestra?
CW: Honestly, I don’t have time to learn how to play another instrument. Being president of the orchestra takes up a lot of my time. It’s hard enough for me to find time to practice the cello, let alone another instrument.
THC: Are you particularly excited about any of the pieces you’ll be performing this semester?
CW: We’re playing a piece by Igor Stravinsky and a piece by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. The orchestra doesn’t choose the music for each concert directly; the music director does that. However, input from the orchestra is really important. Every year, the orchestra is given a poll and asked to tell us which pieces they think would be interesting or challenging to play. We have a really good repertoire for the next couple of concerts. It’s going to be fun to play and fun to listen to.

February 18-20, 24-26, 7:00 p.m.
Loeb Experimental Theater
Directed by Ali R. Leskowitz ’11
Produced by Bryce J. Gilfillian ’12 and Elizabeth J. Krane ’11
“I really like stage violence, and this has a lot of it,” says Crimson arts editor Ali R. Leskowitz ’11 when asked about her experience directing “Howie the Rookie,” an upcoming Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club production of Mark O’Rowe’s play. Opening on February 18 in the Experimental Theater of the Loeb Drama Center, the dark comedy hopes to be a bloodbath of sorts, entertaining, moving, and shocking audience members who dare enter the Dublin underworld.
The two-man play centers on the lives of opposing gang members, Howie Lee (Adam J. Conner ’14) and Rookie Lee (Peter K. Bestoso ’14), who happen to have the same last name but no relation. Howie delivers the first half of the story via monologue, and Rookie continues it in the second half; the play features no dialogue, and the two characters interact only in choreographed fight scenes. “The play is like two individual performances that then come together to be one comprehensive whole,” says Conner.
While Leskowitz has the challenge of staging what—based strictly on the script—could be a completely motionless, prop-less play, she hopes to stay true to what she calls the “heart of theater”: storytelling. “[The play] is a story about surprising connections and friendships between people,” she says. “It’s about guilt and redemption,” Bestoso adds.
In addition to memorizing extensive lines with few actor cues, the two freshmen leads have also mastered Irish accents and practiced visceral fight choreography ranging from dives to punches to chokes. To top it off, the show promises to populate the black box theater with the junkyard detritus of what Conner calls the “projects of Ireland,” including graffiti, discarded tires, barricades, and unconventional seating.
By the end of the show, Leskowitz says, “audiences should be a little scared and also a little sad.” Producer Bryce J. Gilfillian ’12 agrees; “the play is simultaneously badass and groundbreaking. We’re doing awesome things that haven’t been done during my time at Harvard,” he says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Not many authors, let alone world-renowned scholars, would admit that the title of their latest book is based on a mistake. But James Kugel, former Starr Professor of Hebrew Literature at Harvard and now Professor of Bible at Bar Ilan University in Israel, is quite forthright about it. Speaking at Harvard Hillel last Tuesday about his new book “In the Valley of the Shadow: On the Foundations of Religious Belief,” Kugel carefully detailed the philological and historical flaws in the King James Bible’s rendering of his book’s titular phrase, drawn from Psalms 23:4. With a self-deprecating smile, he then posed the obvious question to himself: “If you’re so smart, why did you put it in the title?” Because for Kugel, ‘meaning’—including that of biblical verses—is more about human truths than historical ones. “I liked [the mistranslation] because it really seems to describe the human condition,” he explained. “We walk in the shadow of death in the sense that we don’t like to think about it ... and then one day, suddenly it’s not in the shadows anymore, it’s right there.”
Kugel’s misnomered meditation on religion is thus a deeply human one—part scholarship, part personal confession. No mere academic excursion, “In the Valley of the Shadow” is structured around Kugel’s own bout with cancer. It is a self-described “ramble,” jumping from topic to topic and story to story more as a kind of stream of consciousness than a scholarly essay—a conversation rather than a dissertation. References to the Bible, Arabic legends, the Aeneid, Homer, modern philosophers, anthropologists, and sociologists are intertwined with profoundly personal reflections on mortality—as well as intimate emails from Kugel’s own friends who died of cancer while he was writing the book.
At Hillel, Kugel read passages from “In the Valley of the Shadow” aloud, allowing the eclectic tome to speak for him, and then fielded questions from an audience of students and former colleagues. Religion, he argued, is not about comfort or conformity, as many critics and adherents have contended, but rather about recognizing one’s place in the universe—in relation to God, friends, family, and community. Kugel calls this “living within our borders.” It is a way of being which he feels has been lost in today’s highly individualistic and atomized modern society. 
Though “In the Valley of the Shadow” treats religion as a general phenomenon, rather than any particular faith, Kugel traced the genesis of his thinking about religion to some of his earlier work on Jewish thought, particularly his little-known book “On Being a Jew.” Kugel—a self-identified Orthodox Jew who sports a large black yarmulke—wrote “On Being a Jew” as a sort of guide to Judaism for the students who would frequently accost him after class at Harvard with questions about the faith. The book’s approach to holiness—that human beings must make space for it in their lives, that “God is wherever you let him in” —largely informs Kugel’s broader understanding of the character of the religious experience.
For some at the event, Kugel’s mix of memoir and metaphysical musing proved movingly compelling. “I was struck by his warmth and ability to interweave his personal story of confronting death with theological insights,” said Jason W. Schnier ’11, adding that “what makes Kugel so prescient is that he presents a religious philosophy that is fundamentally different from the Western, and especially the Harvard, model.” Other attendees, however, found the professor’s unusual style to be more problematic. “I appreciated Kugel’s sincerity in discussing his response to a difficult life experience,” said Daniel J. Frim ’14, “However, I don’t know whether Kugel’s response to hardship is informative in scholarly discourse aimed at tracing the origins of religion. I feel as if any comparison between the existential theological musings of modern man and primitive cultic belief is risky.”
The intended audience of Kugel’s book is as colorful and multifarious as its contents. Kugel was clear in his presentation that “In the Valley of the Shadow” is not intended to evangelize or convert, and despite the fact that it creates a dialogue with New Atheist writers like Daniel Dennett, it is not meant as a rebuttal to their works. Indeed, the book stands as a critique to many modern religionists as much as their opponents—and at Hillel, Kugel had some soft-spoken but serious criticism for his fellow Orthodox Jews, whom he described as moving in an overly “isolationist” direction. “I really don’t approve of that,” he said towards the end of his talk. “I really think we ought to have an Orthodox Judaism that is open to science and whatever else we can find out.” Seen in this light, the unconventional mix of the academic and the intimate in “In the Valley of the Shadow” seems wholly sensible. For Kugel, scholarship is personal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In an 1849 essay on aesthetics, German composer Richard Wagner popularized the rather unwieldy term “Gesamtkunstwerk.” According to Wagner, a Gesamtkunstwerk, or a ‘total’ work of art, is the highest attainable artistic ideal, a work that synthesized all the major art forms in a single theatrical performance. Fittingly, Wagner applied this term to the multidisciplinary elegance of opera, which unites so many different artistic inputs into one totalized performance.
Indeed, the artistic amalgam that is opera combines instrumental music, singing, dialogue, and dance to create a multisensory spectacle that may appeal to an audience on multiple aesthetic registers. The viewer may both latch onto the particular art contained within opera that they most appreciate and also experience Wagner’s idea of operatic synthesis.
While not the most popular art form at Harvard, students and graduates are revitalizing opera by performing famous works at Harvard, honing their skills in activities on campus and abroad, and composing works  of their own concerning modern life. They aim to prove that opera, though steeped in tradition, is accessible and relevant.
DIE BAGELMAUS
In the Dunster House dining hall, it’s brain break—the Harvard event that most unites disparate social elements on campus. Overworked student writers, scientists, and athletes intermingle to enjoy cold bagels, old cereal, and, tonight, something completely different. The bewildered crowd, suddenly surrounded by tuxedo-clad actors and frantic musicians, is witnessing the start of dress rehearsal for “Die Fledermaus,” Johann Strauss’ classic work being put on by the Dunster House Opera (DHO). Rather than flee to the opera-free safety of their rooms, however, residents of the house linger a little longer than usual over brain break to see what all the fuss—and noise—is about.
Getting people to go see the opera of their own volition, unsurprisingly, is no easy feat. In some fundamental sense, opera seems unsexy: fat women in gowns stereotypically stand in for action heroes in swimwear; topics of convoluted aristocratic manners and tragic romance appear pitifully outdated; and, worst of all for an American audience, most great operas were not originally written in English. Benjamin J. Nelson ’11, musical director of the Harvard a cappella group the Krokodiloes and star of “Die Fledermaus,” claims to be languishing idly the afternoon before “Fledermaus” opens. However, he answers my questions with bounces and nervous, energetic exclamations. “Opera, whether deservedly or not, intimidates a lot of people, [whereas] a cappella reaches the point of accessibility at which it’s almost annoying,” he says. Indeed, the light-hearted, almost silly nature of a cappella does seem the ultimate contrast to opera’s beauty and renowned history. A cappella concerts are short and audience members know exactly what to expect, while “Die Fledermaus” is more than two and a half hours long and, for the average Harvard student, utterly recondite.
OPERATIC PHILOSOPHIES
The DHO is sensitive to these barriers associated with opera. In order to make their material accessible and appealing to undergraduate audiences, they have a stringent set of criteria for selecting an annual opera. The first of these is that the opera must either be written in English or have a readily available English translation. While this decision does limit the number of available options, it vastly increases access, both for audiences and performers. “I think it’s really great that DHO performs in English,” says Nelson. “I personally would never have auditioned for the show if it hadn’t been in English.”
Cast size is also a factor in selecting an opera. Many operas have one or two title roles and a limited supporting cast. The DHO looks for shows with a decent number of roles as well as a substantial chorus that allow them to cast more performers.
One of the greatest obstacles to performing opera at an undergraduate level is that many of the most famous and recognized roles are infeasible for younger, less developed voices. The corpus of Giuseppe Verdi, for example, is off limits to DHO. “A lot of the operas that I was initially drawn to … were just completely impractical,” says Matthew C. Stone ’11, a Crimson arts editor and stage director of “Die Fledermaus.” “Vocally it would be too taxing for young voices to sing any really heavy operatic repertory.” The human voice does not reach full maturity until the late twenties.
While theater companies on campus can perform well-known shows that will attract audiences, opera companies like DHO are more restricted. “You have to look for lighter fare, or lyric opera, or chamber opera for undergraduate voices,” says Stone. Thus, careful thought goes into selecting an opera that is both practical for college-aged performers and attractive to a college audience.
Lowell House Opera (LHO) takes a radically different approach. Its auditions are open to graduate students and actors outside the Harvard community, and it has more relaxed criteria for selecting operas to perform. Last year, the Lowell House Opera performed Giacomo Puccini’s renowned “Tosca” in Italian with English projections, and almost all its singers were professional. “Historically [the DHO and LHO] perform rather different repertoires,” says music director and conductor of “Die Fledermaus” Matthew A. Aucoin ’12.
This difference amounts to a difference in philosophy: characteristically, the DHO focuses on accessibility in the Harvard community and the LHO focuses on performing the greatest operas in their traditional forms. “I think Harvard’s got the whole spectrum,” says Aucoin.
ARE YOU EXPERIENCED?
This operatic spectrum extends to the level of experience held by the cast in student operas. “Most people who get really involved with opera here don’t come from ‘operatic backgrounds’ because those are really rare,” says Aucoin. Instead, students approach opera having trained in theater or classical music. Jennifer Chen ’11, the current president of the Dunster House Opera, came to the form through her involvement with the Early Music Society of Harvard, which is devoted to the performance of historic Western music.
Though Aucoin now has a good deal of professional experience, he was mostly self-taught before coming to college. Last year, he composed and conducted his own opera, which was based on James Merrill’s epic poem “The Changing Light at Sandover.” His opera, which he describes as “a supernatural love story,” premiered in the Horner Room of the Agassiz Theatre and was cast from a largely undergraduate group. Aucoin has also become interested in conducting, and is studying the art with director of the Harvard-
Radcliffe Orchestra Federico Cortese. Last summer he received an Artist Development Fellowship to study conducting in Milan and Florence.
Other performers in “Die Fledermaus” have also studied opera formally. Sofia M. Selowsky ’12, who plays Prince Orlofsky, has been singing opera since fourth grade. She also received an Artist Development Fellowship to do opera training in Salzburg this summer. But as DHO holds auditions through common casting, many cast members do not enjoy this high level of background experience.
SENSORY SYNTHESIS
As these performers take the leap to try opera for the first time, so too may Harvard students. For those willing to try something new, the rewards are numerous. Opera as a genre is not just about music; rather, it is a confluence of many artistic disciplines. “Opera offers a unique combination of dramatic, musical, and visual experiences,” says James Edward Ditson Professor of Music Anne C. Shreffler. One performance stimulates a gamut of aesthetic sensibilities. Audience members do not go to ‘see’ or ‘hear’ an opera, but rather to ‘experience’ one.
Opera streamlines elements of dance, theater, and vocal and orchestral music into one performance. “What is opera but a fusion of all these different art forms?” says Aucoin. This fusion is fundamental to opera and makes performing one a hefty challenge, especially for undergraduates working with limited resources in terms of space, funding, and experienced performers.
This difficulty requires that a multitude of individual efforts go into the creation of the final operatic product. At DHO’s dress rehearsal, violinists are bent intently over their sheet music, while onstage Nelson makes a flamboyant entrance and bursts into song. “That all of these people come from one undergraduate college’s student body is pretty amazing,” says Aucoin, who himself must be fully absorbed in conducting the orchestra while also intimately attuned to how the people onstage are moving.
CAPABLE CONDUCTION
Because opera is a combination of so many different art forms, conducting one is something of a balancing act. Aucoin says that to conduct successfully, “you have to do everything and nothing.” This paradox captures the conductor’s subtle but crucial role in coordinating dramatic action with music. Aucoin’s job obliges him to communicate subtle changes in the mood of the singers onstage to the musicians seated below in the pit. “You have to make everyone feel comfortable, but you can’t get in the way,” he says. Aucoin emphasizes the importance of allowing singers’ spontaneity to flourish, describing the conductor’s role as “a conduit for the energy of the show.” In opera, because so many things are happening simultaneously, it takes only a small error to derail the entire production. This makes the conductor’s position a tenuous one. “Everyone has to be on their A-game all the time,” says Aucoin.
From a staging perspective, opera is more demanding than a stage play because there are in effect two texts to work with: the libretto, or actual text of the opera, and the musical score. “The music becomes something you have to engage with from a staging standpoint,” says Stone. The director took his cues from the music more than from the text, listening to the score in order to isolate the emotions of a particular scene. The large amount of material, both musical and technical, necessitates a greater degree of choreography than is generally required in theater. “It’s inherently useful, going into a scene, to know what is going to fill every bar of music,” says Stone.
ATTRACTING ATTENTION
Professor Shreffler, who has been teaching a seminar on opera at the Humanities Center for seven years, believes that the inherent difficulties and obscurites of opera can be overcome by engaging Harvard students with the form, particularly due to the resources surrounding the University. “Boston is a powerhouse for scholarly research on opera,” she says. The city is home to the Boston Symphony Orchestra and Boston Baroque—both of which are full orchestras that perform the musical scores of operas—as well as the Boston Lyric Opera.
In her years of teaching the seminar in conjunction with two Tufts University professors, Shreffler has seen that opera can connect with both personal tragedy and the political landscape in a modern context. She cites the discussion topic of last week’s seminar, an ongoing production by the Boston Lyric Opera of “The Emperor of Atlantis.” Composed by Jewish-Czech composer Viktor Ullmann in a concentration camp during the Second World War, it is a thinly-veiled, satirical critique of Hitler. For a Boston Lyric Opera performance, it has received extensive media attention, including a review in the New York Times. “This opera, because of the human interest story, the quality of the music, the fact that it’s not so well known, that it’s not another ‘Tosca,’ has attracted a lot of attention [from the media],” says Shreffler.
In addition to the Humanities Center seminar, Shreffler teaches an undergraduate course with Professor of Music Carol J. Oja on the operas of John C. Adams ’69, who is best known for composing “Nixon in China,” an opera chronicling the former president’s 1972 trip currently running at the famed Metropolitan Opera in New York. Like Ullmann’s work, Adams’ demonstrates opera’s potential for political relevance. There have been so many new political operas since that this new body of work is being referred to as ‘CNN opera.’ “Nixon in China” has a deep Harvard connection, which is part of the reason why it is such a focus in Shreffler’s course. In addition to having been written by Adams, the opera is being directed at the Met by Harvard graduate Peter M. Sellars ’80, and Alice A. Goodman ’80 wrote the piece’s libretto. The Dean’s office has provided funds for students of the course to go see the production. “There are a lot of composers interested in writing operas about current events, and I think that helps to make opera relevant,” says Shreffler.
Aucoin witnessed firsthand the contemporary significance of opera during his time at La Scala in Milan, perhaps the world’s most famous opera house. Aucoin’s stint at La Scala coincided with Italian government’s dramatic cuts for funding of the Arts. “Things were in total chaos,” says Aucoin. “Apart from getting a musical education I got to see the inner workings of a very chaotic time in Italy’s musical history.” People were protesting outside the opera house in large numbers, a testament to the important position opera holds in the popular artistic sensibility of Italy.
CREATIVE TOTALITY
What about opera affects people so profoundly that they are moved to protest when its survival is at stake? Perhaps arguments for the form’s unique creative totality imply an otherwise unattainable artistic access. “It spans the whole range of human emotion,” says Shreffler. The artistic breadth in operatic form, then, may expand the aesthetic possibilities of its content. Harvard academics and performers seek to instill this message to a campus that needs only to listen.

Nearly three months after the first preview of “Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark,” trying to say something novel or insightful about the new Broadway musical—a maximalist, high-tech reimagining of the Spider-Man story—is a quixotic undertaking to say the least. The production delayed its opening multiple times, drained $65 million from its producers’ pockets, and was plagued by technical difficulties and actor injuries—but such controversy only served to thrust “Spider-Man” further into the national spotlight.
The Julie Taymor-directed mega-musical has spurred conversations on the value of spectacle, the importance of actor safety, and the fiscal responsibility of Broadway. It’s inspired an article in The Onion, a cover for The New Yorker, and even a spoof on Saturday Night Live’s “Weekend Update.” Perhaps most bizarre of all, Glenn Beck effusively raved about the production, advising viewers to sell their kidneys in order to get tickets.
By now, “Spider-Man” has been at once parodied, praised, and, as of last week, panned. Though the show does not officially open until March 15, several major critics decided to review the production before its formal premiere. The reviews were largely negative, delivering a probable death sentence to the technically prenatal “Spider-Man.” Among those critics was Ben Brantley of The New York Times, whose commentary ranged from caustic (comparing George Tsypin’s sets to those of a high school production) to downright cruel (ad hominum attacks on Taymor, mockingly calling her an ‘artiste’). “‘Spider-Man’ is not only the most expensive musical ever to hit Broadway;” he writes. “It may also rank among the worst.”
In the wake of these reviews, it’s important to remove ourselves from the cacophonous debates surrounding the show and remember that in spite of its troubles—perhaps even because of them—“Spider-Man” has been talked about more than any other work of theater in recent memory. A theatrical production garnering such widespread attention is certainly notable, if for no other reason than that much of the contemporary theater community seems to live in a state of perpetual fear that its craft is gradually fading into obsolescence. Say what you will about the relative merits of the show—“Spider-Man” has become a phenomenon.
There are a number of things that could account for this, from the budget, to the rock star composers (Bono and the Edge of U2), to the many technical marvels the show boasts. However, the underlying reason why we’re drawn to “Spider-Man” is one Brantley inadvertently points to in his scathing review of the show.
Brantley recounts an anecdote about a technical glitch in the middle of the performance. The show stopped abruptly and—in his words—“for the first time that night, genuine pleasure spread throughout the house.” In jest, Brantley then suggests that “this production should play up regularly and resonantly the promise that things could go wrong. Because only when things go wrong in this production does it feel remotely right.”
While ostensibly mocking the show, Brantley stumbles upon the very reason that “Spider-Man” has become an object of fixation for so many—it isn’t the spectacle, but the spontaneity that captivates us.
“Spider-Man” offers the promise of totally unexpected events. On any given night the show may be interrupted without warning, halted mid-act as an actor hangs suspended in the air above the audience. Such events are engaging because they are unexpected, unpredictable. “Spider-Man” taps into the very thing that draws us to theater: the experience of art as a live event.
I do not mean to advocate technical difficulties or actor injuries as a means of drawing in audiences, but the enormous response to “Spider-Man” can serve as a lesson for theater artists everywhere. By creating pure spontaneity on stage and embracing the unpredictability of live theater, we can find powerful ways of making connections with audiences. In an age when the movie versions of “Spider-Man” seem more financially viable and infinitely less dangerous, Taymor’s stage version reconnects us to the power of live theater. Whether the actors are swinging above the stage or simply dangling in midair, it’s that promise of a totally spontaneous event that has us caught in “Spider-Man”’s web.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The second floor of the Science Center houses the production headquarters of an upcoming film titled “Nuclear Underground.” The editing room walls are papered with evidence of a documentary in progress: color-coded index cards track the development of themes and a large calendar is filled out with grant deadlines. The latter has netted a literal payoff: the filmmakers recently won a grant from the Sundance Documentary Film Program. Peter Galison, Pellegrino University Professor of the History of Science and of Physics, and Robb Moss, who teaches filmmaking in the Visual and Environmental Studies department, were one of 22 Sundance grant recipients from a pool of over 450 projects.
Their film “Nuclear Underground” explores the problem of nuclear waste disposal, focusing on the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in Carlsbad, N.M.. The site is the world’s only operating underground nuclear waste depository. A complex set of environmental, political, and moral debates swirl around the WIPP.  The topic of nuclear waste disposal is ripe for exploration and an appropriate fit for the Sundance Documentary Film Program. The Sundance Institute, the organization which also runs the annual independent film festival of the same name, seeks to fund documentaries which engage with a variety of contentious contemporary issues.
“The documentary is about how we relate to the land, how we relate to the future, and what are our obligations to the future … These are big philosophical questions,” says Galison. Stressing that the film will not be a lecture on nuclear physics, Galison explains that the film’s large philosophical questions are grounded in very tangible issues. The problem of how to dispose of radioactive waste from power plants has created controversy among environmentalists. Nuclear waste, which also comes from nuclear weapons, is a problem because it remains dangerous for thousands of years.
The site at Carlsbad, N.M. was chosen because of the stability of its geological salt formations, which will have to last 10,000 years. Nuclear waste is stored in underground caves tunneled in the salt that, under heat and pressure, will flow like lava to seal off the nuclear waste. The community in Carlsbad is actually quite supportive of WIPP’s presence because it has revived the former miner town’s dying economy. But there are still many New Mexico politicians and residents who object to the storage and shipment of dangerous nuclear waste in their state.
Galison and Moss, who began work on the documentary over a year and a half ago, have visited New Mexico several times to film underground in WIPP as well as to interview people from the local community. Currently, they anticipate that “Nuclear Underground” will take another two years to complete, and will require several more trips to New Mexico. At present, they are also working with a team of animators and musicians, including Incubus guitarist Mike Einziger, a former student of Galison’s who is slated to score the film.
In describing the filmmaking process, both Galison and Moss emphasize how time-consuming it is to produce a documentary. “Coming into the project, we [knew] that we do not have all the answers. We want to learn from the people we’re talking to,” says Galison. The two educators first collaborated on their 2008 documentary “Secrecy,” a film which explored questions of governmental oversight and bureaucratic transparency. They also co-teach the course History of Science 152: Filming Science.
As for “Nuclear Underground,” the two filmmakers stress that they have a long journey ahead of them. The Sundance grant will help, but there is still more footage to film and more funding to seek. “It’s still the early days for us,” says Galison. “There will be many more hours in the editing room.” But the two men both remain grateful and enthusiastic about the film’s prospects. Moss says, “it’s a real shot in the arm to get this kind of authorizing legitimacy, as well as the actual funding.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In caverns cooled to -271°C­—each buried 200 meters below the surface of the earth—two particle beams, accelerated to speeds approaching the speed of light in 27-kilometer-long circular orbits, collide with unfathomable precision in a shower of bizarre subatomic particles.
Eyes fixed on these icy caves, we wait for Nature to give up her secrets.
By now we’ve all heard of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the largest particle collider in the world, which girdles land in Switzerland and France as part of the supercollider complex run by the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). When it first started running a few years ago, there were some who thought its experiments would result in the end of the world. The belief was no more than hysterics, but its cry reflected the strange place contemporary physics holds in our consciousness.
There is an alluring terror to the extreme conditions the accelerator endeavors to recreate. Terms like ‘anti-matter,’ ‘black hole,’ and ‘other dimensions’ ignite the imagination even as they devolve into nonsense. Each word makes sound sense on its own; but when you start putting them together, their meanings begin to blur, to evade intuitive comprehension. At that fundamental level, the answers resolve the mysteries of the questions by revealing greater mysteries.
200 years ago, in the summer of 1797, the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge woke up from an opium-induced sleep with visions of another kind of cavern. In his dream a poem came to him “in which all the images rose up before him as things, with a parallel production of the correspondent expressions, without any sensation or consciousness of effort.” Furiously writing down what was left of the dream, he left us with one of the most mysterious and imaginative poems in all English literature. “Kubla Khan” begins:
In Xanadu did Kubla Khan
A stately pleasure-dome decree:
Where Alph, the sacred river, ran
Through caverns measureless to man...
It would be anachronistic to say that Kubla Khan has anything at all to do with modern particle physics, but the coincidental resemblances “Kubla”’s “pleasure-dome” bears to the LHC are tantalizing. The two are great man-made circular structures, enclosing vast quantities of space. The LHC is admittedly bigger: at 27 kilometers in circumference, it encompasses about 22 miles, twice that of Kubla’s 10.
Yet the eeriness of the “caverns measureless to man” continually resurfaces. The exact phrase repeats later on, and recapitulates into “a sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice.” Outside of the realm of even the most fantastic human artifice, these caverns, made by nature, are the opposite of the “pleasure-dome.” The “caverns” make four appearances in the poem.
The CERN’s website states that four detectors “are installed in four huge underground caverns located around the ring of the LHC.” Like the sacred river, the particle beams pass through underground caverns before surfacing to human measure. But the LHC’s caverns are distinct from Coleridge’s. The CERN is the site of the most precise measurements known to man. What the LHC makes us confront is not immeasurability, but the mystery of what we measure.
Perhaps this nominal coincidence tells us something about the way our knowledge ceaselessly orbits, like particle beams, through “caverns measureless to man”--that we pass through the immeasurable to get to the measurable. Coleridge writes, punning on “measure”:
The shadow of the dome of pleasure
Floated midway on the waves;
Where was heard the mingled measure
From the fountain and the caves.
The “fountain” of particle beams swinging through the “caves” of solenoid magnets hundreds of meters below Cessy, France perhaps yields no immediate music to our ears. But science, like art, must pass through these caves of meaninglessness in order to resound with meaning. Song, like subatomic phenomena, is measured; and it is this urge to measure, common to the scientist and the poet, that lends meaning to our endeavors. So we press our ears to caverns, listening for the measure of the universe.

Magical prose operates like glamour, hiding thin plot and poor narrative construction beneath language so beautiful and breathless that it allows faults to go nearly unnoticed. At times, Karen Russell’s “Swamplandia!” is an ode to prose, filled with clever turns of phrase, sharp insight, and language so rich and detailed that images of an isolated Florida swamp seem to jump from the pages of the book directly into the mind. It is a deep and thorough exploration of the illusions that individuals, families, and societies construct to fight off the often-ugly truth of reality. However, its murky plot and tiresome back-and-forth narration overwhelm Russell’s stylish prose and the charm of her characters, and the novel sinks into a swampy, convoluted mess.
The novel traces the story of “the Bigtree tribe of Ten Thousand Islands,” a family who runs Swamplandia!, “the Number One Gator-Themed Park and Swamp Café” in their area. Chief Bigtree is the family’s patriarch, and his wife, Hilola, and three children—Kiwi, Osceola, and Ava—wrestle alligators, sell artifacts of their often made-up past in the gift shop, and keep each other company on the secluded island where their park is located. When Hilola dies, Chief Bigtree abandons his family, Kiwi leaves to work for a competing park on the mainland, Osceola disappears, and 13-year-old Ava is left to fend for herself and save Swamplandia! from disaster.
Ava is a tragically optimistic and insightful protagonist, pushed too soon to the edge of the chasm separating childhood and adulthood. She is old enough to understand that ghosts are not real, as she is told by her father and older brother Kiwi, but young enough to believe in them for the sake of her mentally unstable sister. Ava clings to her youthful dreams of a perfect world even as reality encroaches upon it; as she puts it, “I was discovering all sorts of beliefs and skepticisms turning like opposite gears inside me, and little drawers of hopes and fears I had forgotten to clean out.”
Her childish beliefs, which include the idea that she is the heroine of Swamplandia! and can save her family from ruin, are no less fantastic than those of the older characters in the novel. Her father is convinced that he can save Swamplandia! by going to talk to donors on the mainland and refuses to acknowledge that his lifestyle and family have fallen to pieces. Similarly Kiwi, the self-proclaimed ‘genius’ of the family with a penchant for the classics and an expansive vocabulary, goes to the mainland with dreams of attending Harvard University and paying off his family’s debt. Though supposedly more rational than Ava, he stubbornly holds to the belief that he can save Swamplandia!, even though he barely makes minimum wage working at the competing World of Darkness theme park. Osceola, too, builds a reality for herself in her mind and finds a lover in a ghost that she believes lives in the forest.
The Bigtree clan lives an illusory life, though this self-deception is due to love. Ava ultimately breaks the spell and lets in reality, although she loses a part of herself along the way in an intensely disturbing plot development near the end of the novel. Though this dark moment is a key part of Ava’s understanding of the ugliness that often underlies life’s perfection, it is abrupt and heartbreaking, and completely blackens the novel’s playfully sinister mood. Russell does not give this trauma an adequate resolution, and because of this failure on Russell’s part, the novel’s clean conclusion feels false.
Ava’s dark coming of age, though jarring, is one of the only standout moments in the murky, messy body of the novel. About one-third of the way into “Swamplandia!,” Russell switches from telling the story solely through Ava’s eyes to alternating between Ava’s point of view on the island and Kiwi’s point of view on the mainland. Although Kiwi is a complex and interesting character, the events of his mainland life seem superfluous and secondary to the story of Ava’s crisis on the island. His adventures on the mainland read like a separate collection of short stories rather than cohesive parts of a novel; it seems that Russell’s success as a short story writer obstructs her ability to write a full-length novel with a single overarching plot.
Kiwi’s less vivacious narration, combined with a general lack of plot movement, slow the middle of the book to a snail’s pace, and only curiosity about Ava’s well-being serves as motivation to continue reading. The plot becomes more and more difficult to follow as the alternating narration continues, and the abrupt finale when the siblings’ previously divergent realities collide is bizarre and jumbled. Russell tries too hard to end the novel neatly; she resolves the family’s division in an implausible way and fails to address or explore the darkest moments introduced in the story of Swamplandia!’s demise. Yet although her plot is often convoluted and disjointed, the beauty of Russell’s prose and the depth of Ava’s insights lend necessary momentum to “Swamplandia!”
“I sort of thought this future must exist somewhere, the year of our triumph floating in utero in outer space, as small as the pinheads of stars,” says Ava, musing on the disintegration of dreams. ”Swamplandia!” suggests that the future is immediately reachable and visible, but only if we shatter the illusions that obscure it.
“Swamplandia!” is a meditation on family and its interconnections, and on the lies, small and large, that individuals tell to make reality more bearable. Russell’s surreal world is as shatteringly real as it is a complete fabrication, and can be touching to anyone who knows what it is to have broken dreams.

On Jan. 21, Dean of Harvard College Evelynn M. Hammonds and University Provost Steven E. Hyman presented residential tutors with information regarding alcohol-related admissions to University Health Service’s Stillman Infirmary over the past few years. Although the College has declined to release exact statistics regarding the number of students, tutors at the meeting reported they were told that the number of students admitted to UHS during fall term for alcohol-related reasons was nearly equivalent to the total number admitted for these reasons last year. If true, this means the number of undergraduates seeking attention for intoxication will rise for the third straight academic year; last year, almost 200 students sought UHS treatment for alcohol-related illnesses.
This increase would represent an interesting problem for the Office of Alcohol and Other Drug Services. The AODS was created in 2005 in response to an alarming increase in alcohol-related admissions to UHS. After 123 students were admitted to UHS in 2002-2003—a number that represented a sevenfold increase from five years beforehand—former College Dean Benedict H. Gross ’71 created the Committee to Address Alcohol and Health at Harvard. The Committee recommended that a single administrator oversee all alcohol-related issues at the College, so the AODS was created in 2005. The creation of AODS seemed to alleviate the problem somewhat; around 124 students were admitted to UHS in 2006-2007 and the blood-alcohol levels of those arriving at the infirmary were lower than in previous years.
On one hand, the increase could mean that students increasingly are taking advantage of the College’s amnesty policy, which says, “Students may bring an intoxicated or drug-impaired friend to University Health Services or to a hospital, or seek assistance from College residential life staff or HUPD, and by doing this, neither they nor the friend will face disciplinary action from the College for having used or provided alcohol or drugs.” Still, just a year ago AODS Director Ryan M. Travia said that attributing the rise in alcohol-related hospitalizations to heightened awareness of the amnesty policy would be an “optimistic outlook.”
In the face of this constellation of facts, we urge UHS to release statistics about the number of students who have been hospitalized this year for alcohol-related reasons as well as provide more details about the alcohol-related cases they see.
Useful details would concern the severity of alcohol cases seen, which might be diagnosed from the blood-alcohol levels of students who have been admitted, how many students have had their stomachs pumped, and how many students merely sleep the night in the infirmary. They would also concern the ethnographic particulars of the cases seen: Are there specific class years or groups of people that are being seen more? For instance, in 2007, a UHS report revealed a steep decline in the number of athletes admitted for alcohol-related reasons, indicating that some basic characteristics are surveyed. Knowing what characteristics contribute to an increased risk for alcohol hospitalization will warn relevant interest groups to be more vigilant about protecting their members. A student is more likely to take seriously the benevolent advice of a friend or blockmate than the advice written on a water bottle. And these people are more likely to step in if they are convinced that certain types of behaviors toward alcohol have proven consequences. Indeed, without such details the AODS’s warnings about dangerous alcohol behaviors lack a certain urgency and gravity, because it is too easy to dismiss alcohol hospitalization.
To be true, the College could, in fact, make small beneficial changes to the alcohol education it provides, particularly concerning freshmen. The 2004 committee reported noted that proctors could be better marshaled to educate freshman about safe alcohol behaviors. Indeed, this is still the case. Peer Advising Fellows should also be better employed in this effort. AlcoholEdu, the online alcohol education program all incoming freshmen must complete, is not enough of an introduction to safe alcohol behaviors for this group.
However, in the end, the people in the best position to stop risky drinking are one’s fellow undergraduates. Unless we take a certain amount of personal responsibility for the way we drink, then the dangerous drinking habits that exist on our campus, as on many others, will not change. The impetus for this cultural shift will not come from rhetoric without facts. With this information, as a community, we can come to terms with the increase in alcohol-related hospitalizations.

The Parents Television Council has called it “harmful, irresponsible, illegal, and adult-themed.” In contrast, Newsweek’s Jessica Bennet calls it “the most realistic show on television.” Since its Jan. 11 premiere, MTV’s latest teen drama, “Skins,” has been surrounded by controversy and allegations that it contains child pornography—several of the actors on the show are under 18. This has prompted advertisers, including General Motors and H & R Block, to withdraw their participation from the series. In response to media attention surrounding the show’s provocative debut, network executives ordered producers to make the show’s content less offensive, before airing upcoming episodes. The only thing more disappointing than the show’s assertion that a significant portion of the teenage demographic lives only for sex and drugs, however, is MTV’s willingness bend to critics’ pressure. Although the show may very well portray teenage sexuality in a questionable manner, MTV should not censor it.
“‘Skins’ is life,” declares the narrator of an extended trailer for the TV-MA rated series about nine friends navigating the world of adolescence. But the meticulous innuendo and single-minded focus on sexuality featured in the pilot episode suggest otherwise. “Skins” is a far cry from the life of an average American high school student, and this could have triggered the exaggerated response to the series, and its implied threat of a scantily clad cultural revolution.
The show is nearly identical to the original, British version of the series, which initially generated a degree of controversy in the United Kingdom but continued to air unedited and is now in its fifth season. A major cause for the distinction between the reception of the show in the U.S. and in the UK may be the lack of a British equivalent to the PTC, an American activist group that has filed letters of complaint with the U.S. Senate and House Judiciary Committees as well as the Department of Justice requesting an investigation of MTV for child pornography and exploitation on the show. Although MTV announced its plans to make edits before the PTC’s letter was released, the PTC is seeking legal action against the network for the mere production of the content.
Journalist Emily Bell, of the British newspaper “The Guardian,” recently condemned the impact of criticism from the Parents Television Council on MTV and the show’s sponsors. “In a country where the first amendment is carefully guarded and often invoked, the PTC represents the unvarnished ‘moral majority’ view which is far removed from free expression,” Bell blogged in a post that featured a still from the show captioned, “No sex, please, we’re American.”
Just as a seemingly innocent kiss in the U.S. may be considered public indecency in Iran, a frivolous albeit raunchy youth soap opera from Europe is currently fueling media uproar in America. A major distinction between the U.S. and non-democratic countries is that free speech—rather than cultural, moral, or religious bias—dictates the media. From “Farenheit 9/11” to “The Glenn Beck Program,” the U.S. permits the distribution of politically charged, religiously diverse, violent, or otherwise controversial content that would be highly censored or banned by state-run media in many conservative countries. Moreover, since the U.S. heavily criticizes nations that ban media content inconsistent with their national values, we have little basis to impose censorship on risqué content here in the U.S.
Granted, the sensationalism of “Skins” raises legitimate concerns about the well-being of its purported target audience. According to David Carr of The New York Times, “MTV leaves it to real-life parents to explain that sometimes, when a car goes underwater, nobody survives and that a quick hookup with a cute boy at the party may deliver a sexually transmitted disease along with a momentary thrill.” Early speculation, however, is not reason enough to cancel the series. The show exhibits no obvious threat to public safety or national security. It merely presents the familiar theme of teenage rebellion in a blunt, explicit manner. As long as other sexually charged shows like “True Blood” and “Gossip Girl” continue to air despite drawing audience members of an impressionable age, “Skins” should not be censored.
Yes, “Skins” is vulgar, unrealistic, and perhaps unsuitable for its target demographic of all-American teens. We must permit its broadcast regardless. At stake are not high school crushes and teenage angst, but censorship and open-mindedness.

After two years that saw Congress passing and President Obama signing one big legislative initiative after another–the stimulus! health care (with bonus student loan reform)! financial reform!–the next two promise to be rather boring. With the House controlled by Republicans, and Harry M. Reid(D-N.V.) needing seven Republicans in order to break filibusters in the Senate, the chances of something major reaching Obama’s desk are slim indeed. This Congress instead will likely be characterized by long, arduous negotiations between the administration and the Republican leadership over spending. Whatever results will likely disappoint both parties, and be at most an incremental change from the status quo. The period of big, sweeping action, then, is mostly over.
There’s one big exception, however: corporate tax reform. In announcing his latest budget, Obama reiterated his support for revamping the tax, while Rep. David L. Camp(R-M.I.), the House Republican with jurisdiction on tax issues, has expressed interest in an overhaul of both the personal and corporate income taxes. The effort is far from settled. Obama has said he wants any reform to be revenue-neutral, whereas many Republicans, displaying just how much they actually care about cutting the deficit, have said they would only support reforms that cut revenue. But with the business lobby pushing hard for reform as well, there is reason to believe some package will be passed.
The approach Obama has proposed involves getting rid of various loopholes in the tax, and using the increased revenue to lower overall rates. As the U.S. has one of the highest corporate taxes in the world at the moment, this would presumably encourage corporations currently located overseas to move back to the U.S., and contribute more to the economy while here. Obama’s logic is sound so far as it goes, and he does have historical precedent. The bipartisan 1986 tax reform deal achieved a similar result with the personal income tax, reducing rates while eliminating a large number of deductions. However, this approach doesn’t go far enough. The best corporate tax reform would involve ditching the tax altogether.
For one thing, the tax is a haven for special-interest carve-outs, with different industries paying vastly different rates. While overhaul efforts like Obama’s can limit this, chances are, within a few Congresses, many of the carve-outs abolished in a reform will return after some lobbying. The corporate tax is also the easiest way for Congressmen to do favors for particular industries. While one could theoretically favor special industries in the personal income tax, most taxpayers do not itemize returns, meaning they do not benefit from special deductions, and thus that those carve-outs would be worth less. The only way to end this problem for good is to end corporate tax.
Liberals should also be concerned by the tax’s lack of progressivity. The money taxed by a corporate tax would have ended up in the hands of individual people, be it through compensation paid by the corporation itself, or that paid to companies which it pays for goods and services. Maybe the money taken by the tax would have just lined executives’ wallets, but it could be used to hire more low-income workers as well. The corporate tax is thus too blunt a tool to be reliably progressive. It would be better to wait until the money currently taken by the tax reaches individuals, and then to tax progressively.
Abolishing the corporate tax without making up the lost revenue–over $200 billion annually–elsewhere in the tax code would, of course, be foolish, especially given the long-term threat posed by the budget deficit. It would make a lot of sense to replace it with a tax punishing bad corporate behavior. For example, a financial transactions tax could prevent high-speed trading of the like that led to a minor stock market collapse last spring, while also raising considerable revenue. Alternately, a carbon tax would lead to serious reductions in emissions and be a start toward addressing climate change. Unfortunately, last Congress’ battles over financial reform and cap-and-trade climate legislation indicate that these are bridges too far for even a much more liberal Congress than the current one.
Raising the personal income tax, however, would likely be a palatable alternative. This has an intuitive appeal as a replacement measure. Repealing the corporate tax means individuals are going to be earning more through wages that would have otherwise been spent paying the corporate tax, and raising the personal income tax would allow the government to recoup some of those increased earnings. What’s more, a personal income tax hike focused on high earners would end up being more progressive than the corporate tax ever was. High corporate taxes could prevent a company from hiring working class people who really need the job. A tax bracket for millionaires might prevent a few families from buying third cars. I’d say that’s a fair trade.
So Obama should offer Republicans, and their corporate allies, a deal. If they agree to new tax brackets for the richest of the rich, he will support a total abolition of the corporate income tax. It’s so crazy, it just might work.

In March of 2003, on the eve of the Iraq War, The Harvard Crimson found that only 34 percent of Harvard students supported America’s impending military action. Over the next five years, as the body count mounted and many of the justifications for invasion proved dubious, that figure dwindled. Given that Harvard boasts more Congressional Medal of Honor winners than any institution other than the service academies, one could be forgiven for being surprised to find that the relationship between the military and the university was so poor. But the once-robust tie between the U.S. military and Harvard  University already had frayed dramatically during the decades preceding the Iraq War. The decline began during the Vietnam War, when the Reserve Officer Training Corps was banned from Harvard  College. In prior generations, well over a hundred Harvard College graduates donned the uniform of America’s armed forces each year. Yet, in the decades after Vietnam that number shrank precipitously: When I started my freshman year at Harvard in 2001, less than 1 percent of my classmates were on the path to military service.
At Harvard, as the first bombs dropped from American warplanes onto Iraqi soil, the military was an unpopular institution, fighting an unpopular war, led by an unpopular president. It hardly seemed a fertile environment for rebuilding the ties that bound the nation’s most prestigious university to the nation’s all-volunteer armed forces.
Less than a decade later, however, there are more combat veterans on Harvard’s campus than there have been in over a generation. Military service is an increasingly acceptable and, in some circles, even popular post-graduation calling. On campus, spitting on soldiers who return from combat does not happen any longer, it has been replaced by hearty words of thanks and even celebrations to honor the university’s veterans. Harvard contributes money side by side with the Veteran’s Administration to help pay for veterans’ tuition bills. Perhaps the most visible symbol of the military’s rehabilitation on Harvard’s campus is an increasingly audible call from all constituencies – students, faculty, alumni, and administrators – for the reinstatement of ROTC at Harvard College. This sentiment was most clearly displayed by University President Drew G. Faust who announced in November that Harvard would welcome an ROTC program to its campus in the event that the military’s “Don’t ask, Don’t tell” policy was repealed.
What happened? How has a gap that only widened during times of relative peace and prosperity been narrowed so rapidly during an era of militarism that is decried nowhere more harshly than from the Ivory Tower? And what does it mean for the future relationship between Harvard and the American society?
The change began with a trickle, as a few Harvard men and women, moved by a call to serve their country, chose the path less traveled. September 11th and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq roused passions that moved individuals with boundless possibilities to join the military. Those who would never have joined the military during peacetime, who in other eras would have become bankers or lawyers or doctors, chose to risk their lives in service of an ideal. On the other end, soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan decided to make Harvard College and its graduate schools their first step in reentering civil society after service.
These warriors began to remind Harvard just what the military is all about. These soldiers’ stories brought humanity to a maligned institution and painted a vastly different picture of the military than most of those on campus imagined. It is a place where young people trying to do the right thing wrestle daily with the very ethical dilemmas that are tackled in the university classroom. It is a place where men and women live by trusting each other and where they build relationships that last a lifetime. It is a place where the bridging of cultural gaps often yields the most powerful payoffs. It is a place where learning—new tactics, new people, new places—is a matter of survival. Harvard is slowly coming to see that in many ways, the men and women of America’s military are the types of people that it hopes to produce.
The military is not a perfect institution, but neither is Harvard. Scholars and soldiers who compose these institutions have a great deal to learn from one another. It is my sincere hope that the collateral damage from America’s current wars is the chasm between its military and its elite. And it is in this vein that we hope President Faust will make good on her promise to bring ROTC back to Harvard’s campus. Harvard and the military both will benefit, but the biggest winner will be the American society of which both these institutions are an inextricable part.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After receiving high praise last week for Cambridge’s AAA bond rating, City Manager Robert W. Healy Jr. came under fire at last night’s City Council meeting as councillors and a disgruntled resident questioned his performance.
The meeting began with a public comment by Cambridge resident Judy Johnson, who initially spoke about a resolution concerning funding transportation services for the elderly in the city. She then segued into commentary about the City Manager’s salary.
Healy is the highest paid municipal manager in Massachusetts, having made $336,317 last year according to a report by Cambridge Day, a local online newspaper. Under the most recently negotiated contract, the City Manager—who has been in the position for over 30 years—will leave his post with a retirement package totaling at least $5 million.
A verbal exchange ensued between Johnson and Mayor David P. Maher after he and other councillors asked her to speak solely on the policy order. Johnson did not comply with the request.
“If you pull the curtain back you will see that he is an ordinary man,” Johnson said, comparing Healy to the Wizard of Oz.
“You are out of line, and this is the end of the three minutes,” Maher responded, referring to the time limit on individual public comments. He then dislodged his gavel as he motioned for the next speaker.
Johnson immediately left the council chambers, stating “I hope this is on TV,” to which several councillors responded that the session was being recorded.
Councillors then put Healy in the hot seat, returning to his agenda items at the meeting for further questioning.
Councillor Kenneth E. Reeves ’72 was the most vocal participant last night regarding Healy’s ability to communicate with the City Council. He took particular issue with the manager’s report on Enterprise Rent-A-Car’s use of a public street as a parking lot.
“I cannot believe that you have prepared for us what [Enterprise] told you as the factual basis for your response,” Reeves said in response to the data presented by the City Manager and other city officials.
In addition to resolutions regarding snow removal and the condemnation of the death of Ugandan LGBT activist David Kato, the Council introduced a policy order concerning the transmission of information from the City Manager to the City Council.
Sponsored by Councillors E. Denise Simmons and Leland Cheung, the policy order would require the City Manager to select a point person to transmit information to councillors as soon as violent crimes or other community tragedies occur.
“I want results, I want this just to happen,” Cheung said. “This isn’t like this is a new idea.”
Cheung told The Crimson that the City Manager has notified councillors in the past via e-mail, phone calls, or text messages, and that yesterday’s order is to create greater consistency and more real time communication about residents’ concerns.
“I believe the Council has to wake up,” Reeves said. “We’re sitting here sort of scratching our navel trying to figure out how to get this information … and despite scratching our navel, we don’t get the information anyway.”
The resolution was passed unanimously.

Harvard students and planet-saving enthusiasts gathered yesterday evening at the Graduate School of Design to hear three environmental experts discuss eco-friendly design initiatives and innovative recycling projects as part of a four-part series on resource efficiency titled “Much, Much More, With Much Much Less.”
The speakers—who spelled out a number of everyday ways in which individuals can strive to help the planet—included environmental microbiology professor Colleen M. Hansel, artist and designer J. Manuel Mansylla, and researcher and waste management expert Pablo Rey.
The central topic of the evening’s lecture was that human creativity and imagination have no limits, especially in an age where “green development” problems need rapid solutions.
Hansel introduced the issue, referencing conundrums like the proliferation of waste from mine drainage.
Hansel said that past methods of dealing with this waste included building chemical reactors and flooding the mines, but the newest trend is to simply “help nature clean itself.”
She said that more than 700 coal mines worldwide could be targeted for remediation using less environmentally damaging methods, like exploiting genetically modified microbes to clean up waste products.
Mansylla dedicated his speech to the oft-overlooked damage caused by the production and usage of plastics. An artist in Guatemala City, Mansylla uses salvaged materials in the bulk of his work, reflecting a philosophy he referred to as “materiality.”
Mansylla also focused on raising awareness of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, an area in the Pacific Ocean afflicted with higher-than-average plastic contamination.
He provided a series of startling statistics regarding the volume of garbage in this area.
Mansylla returned several times to the importance of “visualization” as key to comprehending the gravity of current environmental degradation. According to Mansylla, art can be used in public spaces in order to confront people through visual representations of pollution.
Pablo Rey closed the presentation by providing examples of several initiatives, mostly based in Europe, that seek to repurpose waste products in order to improve public resource efficiency.
Rey showed an image of melted plastic and dirt and followed it with a slide depicting a young boy rolling in camera film, unaware that he is in fact playing with what is deemed to be “waste.”
The final two seminars in the lecture series will be held on April 5 and 6.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Friends and family filled the pews of Memorial Church yesterday night during a service to honor the memory of Adams House resident Ilya Chalik ’11.
Chalik died Sunday morning in his Adams dorm room. Administrators have not released details regarding the cause of Chalik’s death.
During the service, various speakers shared memories of Chalik’s kindness and generosity.
“It’s moments when we love and are loved that make life worth living, and Ilya obviously did that for each and every one of us,” Matthew R. Cohen ’11 said, his voice cracking.
Cohen attended Northside College Preparatory High School with Chalik and lived blocks away from him when they were young.
Chalik—a lover of dance, a Tai Chi expert, and an avid traveler—was described as “a congenial person” who was devoted to God and “loved life.”
“His death comes so unexpectedly and so much too soon,” said Allan M. Brandt, a history of science professor who taught a graduate level seminar in which Chalik was enrolled.
Anna M. Resnick ’09, who knew Chalik from Harvard Hillel, said, “There are some times when you feel really small and there isn’t really anything you can say.”
Resnick instead chose to lead those in attendance in a traditional Jewish melody.
Although Resnick began the singing, the entire congregation joined in the heart-felt tune.
Later in the memorial service, Alexander K. Sherbany ’11, one of Chalik’s roommates, said that Chalik “loved people very much.”
He recalled a time when, on a hike, after Sherbany fell into a stream up to his ankles, Chalik offered Sherbany a pair of his own socks.
“He was the kind of guy that would share without a second thought,” Sherbany said.
During his time at Harvard, Chalik was secretary of the Harvard College in Asia Program and co-president of the Harvard Tai Chi Tiger Crane Club. Linfeng Yang ’11, Chalik’s co-president, spoke of Chalik’s character and described his love of Tai Chi. When he finished speaking, Yang bowed to the stage as a sign of respect.
At the conclusion of the memorial, with tutor Charles E. Lockwood on the piano, Adams House Masters John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67 and Judith S. Palfrey ’67 walked down the aisle, acknowledging those who showed up to pay their respects.
Since Chalik’s passing two days ago, over 30 people have left him messages on an Adams House online forum entitled “From Adams.”
At the memorial, Sean Palfrey said that the following quote from the page summed up his interactions with Chalik: “No matter what kind of day I was having, it would always be better after talking to [Ilya].”
Remembrances continued after the memorial at a reception in Adams House.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction.
CORRECTION: FEB. 15, 2011.
The Feb. 15 article "Friends Honor Ilya Chalik" incorrectly stated that Alexander K. Sherbany '11 had fallen into a river with water up to his knees. It was, in fact, a stream, and the water reached only his ankles.

About 300 juniors and seniors have petitioned to receive Core credit for departmental courses this year, according to administrators in the Program in General Education.
The surge in petitions reflects the difficulties that some students that have remained in the Core curriculum are facing in trying to find classes to fulfill their graduation requirements, said Director of the Program in General Education Stephanie H. Kenen.
“We were actually surprised by the volume [of requests],” she said. “In some ways, I think there may be some sense of being stuck with an old curriculum.”
According to Kenen, about 90 percent of seniors and 50 percent of juniors are still in the Core program.
Kenen said that while the Program of General Education has attempted to assign Core designation to many new Gen Ed courses, the College has been accommodating in accepting petition requests during the transition from the old Core curriculum to the new Gen Ed program.
“While we want students to fulfill the obligations of the curricular parameters that were set for them, there’s a limit to the pedagogical benefits to forcing students in their second-semester senior year to take courses that they have no interest in taking,” said Kenen. She added, however, that the College “wouldn’t let them just take anything.”
Professor of History Emma Dench said she thinks that juniors and seniors who are still on the Core are limited by dwindling course offerings.
“For students who are still on the Core, there aren’t a huge amount of options,” she said.
Samantha R. Go ’11, an Environmental Science and Public Policy concentrator, petitioned to get an East Asian Studies course to count for her Historical Study A Core requirement last spring.
“I didn’t find any of the Hist A courses listed in the catalog particularly interesting,” she said. “I wanted something more relevant to either what I was studying, ESPP, or relevant to my research, which is in China.”
Go said she encountered little difficulty in getting her petition approved.
“Because the Core was being phased out, it was easier than it would have been otherwise,” she said. “They were pretty flexible.”
On the other hand, Joseph D. Hiatt ’11, an Anthropology concentrator, said he was unsuccessful in his attempt to get Anthropology 2000: “Osteoarchaeology Lab” approved for his Science B requirement this past fall.
Hiatt took the course anyway, but said he had to take Science of the Physical Universe 20: “What Is Life? From Quarks to Consciousness” simultaneously to fulfill the requirement.
Though Haotian “Sam” Fang ’11 said he has not felt the need to petition for Core credit, he said he thinks the rise in petitions can be attributed to dissatisfaction with a program that is being phased out.
“Seniors are just fed up with the Core,” he said. “They have this mentality of ‘Why don’t you just let us off?’”

Harvard College will send out approximately 300 “likely letters”—the same number that it offered last year—to applicants by the end of this year’s admissions cycle, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 told The Crimson in an interview last week.
The notices are typically sent to athletes and other exceptional candidates to inform them of their expected admissions in the spring, according to Fitzsimmons.
In past application cycles, the College has mailed about 200 letters to athletes and about 100 letters to other students with outstanding non-athletic attributes. Fitzsimmons said he expects these numbers to remain the same this cycle.
“It’s a hard thing to do, trying to determine who will be admitted and who won’t,” said Fitzsimmons, explaining why so few letters are typically offered.
While likely letters have been a longtime fixture of the admissions process at Ivy League universities, they have gained a special importance at Harvard because the College does not have an early admissions program that would otherwise guarantee acceptance earlier in the process, Fitzsimmons said.
Gay S. Pepper, an independent college counselor in Conn., said likely letters for non-athletes allow colleges to jump-start the process of wooing applicants they would especially like to see enroll.
“It’s all kind of a dance .... The colleges want to send a letter of encouragement to the kids they really want,” Pepper said. “It’s a new way of communicating—a way to increase yield.”
The likely letter plays a critical role in athletic recruitment efforts, said Harvard women’s volleyball coach Jennifer Weiss.
“Now that we don’t have our early action program, it’s very important to have likely letters,” she said. “We’re still competing against schools that [do].”
The College sends out letters from Oct. 1 through March 15, and Weiss encourages the high school athletes she is recruiting to complete their applications by October in order that they might hear back from the admissions office earlier. While coaches can express their interest to a particular student, they have to be careful to only support candidates with realistic chances of admission, Weiss said.
Fitzsimmons said that  the admissions office confers with coaches, but the application still must go through the regular reading process.
“We have influence, but admissions has the final say,” Weiss said. “Your pool of candidates gets so small so quickly because of the academics.”
Recruited athletes who receive a likely letter are expected to accept a formal offer of admission in the spring, Weiss said.
Pepper said that while the process for recruited athletes is more straightforward, it is less clear why certain non-athletes receive a likely letter.
“The colleges hold the cards and they’re not going to tell you what they do and don’t do,” Pepper said.
Paul Harris, a senior at Carver High in Atlanta, received a likely letter from Harvard last Friday. According to Harris, the letter congratulated him and said that the admissions office sent the letter because they thought he would be a good match.
“I didn’t know what to do. I just sat there thinking any minute now I’ll wake up .... I’m still trying to take it all in,” he said.

Bob Slate will close its local chain of stationery stores in March after serving Harvard and Porter Square for 78 years, store ownership announced on Thursday.
The company, officially Bob Slate, Stationer, has been seeking a buyer since October 2009. It chose two years ago not to renew its Harvard Square lease covering its Harvard Square locations due to “declining sales” and “advancing age,” according to a letter to its patrons on its website.
The office and art supply store, which currently occupies 1288 Mass. Ave. as well as 63 Church St. in Harvard Square, was passed down from its late founder, Bob Slate, to his sons Justin and Mallory Slate.
All three locations, including the one in Porter Square, will close by the end of March.
The business started as a small office supply shop on 8 Holyoke St. in the mid-1930s. Bob Slate then moved to 1284 Mass. Ave., and ran a joint office supply and laundromat for a few decades.
The family-owned business boomed, which led to the opening of two more stores by the 1980s, Mallory Slate said.
But in 1986, when the first Staples was introduced, the company was forced to re-envision its business model to focus on stationery.
The reformed approach kept the company going at a growing rate until the early 2000s.
“It’s never been the same,” Mallory Slate said. “Our sales started declining ... I just started getting older and grumpier; we’ve been slipping and sliding since 2001.”
The downturn in business led the Slates to consider selling the business in recent years.
“This company needs new blood, invigorated vision,” Mallory Slate added. “It’s time to get off the stage, and so that’s what we’re doing. We want to do that before the stage collapses.”
Mallory Slate said he will miss his staff, his employees and “everything” about the work that has consumed his life.
Molly E. Dektar ’12, who is pursuing a secondary field in Visual and Environmental Studies, said that she frequented the stationery store to purchase painting supplies, distinctly colored pens, and even a Van Gogh umbrella.
“I’m upset that they’re closing because they’re such a convenient place to get obscure art supplies,” she said.
Dektar, who helped design stage props in last spring’s Harvard Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production of “Into The Woods,” said that Bob Slate’s location helped her make the necessary last-minute purchases to complete the project.
“I don’t know what they’re going to be replaced by,” Dektar said, “but they were a very valuable resource.”
Denies A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, echoed similar sentiments.
“The thing about losing a business like that is that you can’t replace them,” she said. “You can’t replace seven decades.”

Harvard Law School Professor Alan M. Dershowitz will join Wikileaks founder Julian P. Assange’s legal defense team, according to a Wikileaks statement released yesterday.
Dershowitz told The Crimson that he will serve in an advisory position and said he does not expect a more active role unless the U.S. were to prosecute Assange.
Assange’s head lawyer Geoffrey R. Robertson, who has worked with Dershowitz in the past, contacted the professor to work on the case.
Dershowitz has a history of participating in high-profile cases, including taking part on the “dream team” legal counsel that defended O.J. Simpson.
Assange’s Wikileaks organization has been under scrutiny around the world for releasing leaked documents from the U.S. State Department.
Though Assange is not facing charges in the U.S., he currently faces extradition charges in Britain related to a sexual assault investigation in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks will appear in American courts for the first time today in Alexandria, Va. regarding the Justice Department’s subpoena of all records of communication between Wikileaks and its supporters via the social networking site Twitter, which is anticipated to resist the order.
“This is an outrageous attack by the Obama administration on the privacy and free speech rights of Twitter’s customers—many of them American citizens,” Assange said in the Wikileaks press release that also announced the addition of Dershowitz to the legal team.
Dershowitz said he was interested in the case, which deals with the rapid dissemination of information via the Internet, because of its connection with “new media”—such as Facebook, Twitter, and blogging—and its relationship with the Fourth Amendment’s defense of privacy.
“Look at what the new media did in Egypt,” Dershowitz said. “The U.S. is trying to encourage new media in Iran, but trying to shut it down in the U.S. It is not just Assange’s First Amendment rights, but our First Amendment rights that need to be protected.”
In 1972, Dershowitz took on a similarly high-profile free speech case when he defended Senator Mike Gravel in the Supreme Court after Gravel read the Pentagon Papers—leaked top-secret documents detailing the military history of the Vietnam War—into the Congressional Record and then published the documents. The Papers were first leaked and published in the New York Times.
“Just because the incident is different than the ink on the paper in the New York Times, it is still the same issue,” Dershowitz said. “This case comes as close to the Pentagon Papers case as anything else so it is well within my area of expertise.”
“This case has to be fought in the courts, and in the courts of public opinion, diplomatically [and] politically,” Dershowitz added.

Economics Professor Kenneth S. Rogoff received the Deutsche Bank Prize in Financial Economics last Thursday for his contributions to the field of international finance and macroeconomics.
The prize is awarded biannually by the Center for Financial Studies in partnership with Goethe University Frankfurt, and carries an endowment of 50,000 euros.
“He’s an incredibly well-established, well-respected researcher, in the field of international finance particularly,” Economics Department Chair John Y. Campbell said. Rogoff’s work focuses on optimal monetary policy, exchange rates, and sovereign debt.
“He is an excellent theorist, but he has had a long-standing interest in empirical work. He tries to keep at least one foot on the ground when he is writing about economic issues,” Economics Professor Richard N. Cooper said.
Rogoff said the prize was a “huge honor” in an e-mailed statement, adding that he follows three “extraordinary” recipients. Eugene F. Fama, Michael D. Woodford, and Robert J. Shiller have also received the biannual award since it was established in 2005.
Rogoff, who is on leave for the current academic year, normally teaches Ec 1545: “International Financial and Macroeconomic Policy,” as well as a first-year graduate macroeconomics class. Last year, he also taught a freshman seminar entitled “Dealing with the Global Financial Crisis.”
“He is the nicest guy; he is so warm,” said Zachary M. Goldstein ’13, who took Rogoff’s freshman seminar. “He was always very friendly and very open, and it was a very wonderful experience.”
Last month, Rogoff’s best-selling 2009 book “This Time is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly” won the fifteenth annual TIAA-CREF Paul A. Samuelson Award for Outstanding Scholarly Writing on Lifelong Financial Security.
Rogoff’s analysis of financial crises was co-written with Carmen M. Reinhart, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, D.C.
“In many ways, Ken Rogoff is the man of the hour with this book,” Campbell said.
In this week’s issue of “The Economist,” Rogoff tied for second in a poll asking, “Which economist has the most important ideas in a post-crisis world?”

A record 2,260 students woke up yesterday morning to a list of romantic prospects in their inboxes generated by Datamatch—a matchmaking service operated by the Harvard Computer Society—just in time for Valentine’s Day.
HCS President Carl T. Jackson ’13 said that the integration of this year’s Datamatch with Facebook, as well as a “better and funnier” survey, likely contributed to the increase in submissions this year.
The service assesses student compatibility with an “advanced” algorithm developed by HCS that processes students’ answers to the Datamatch survey.
Students who filled out the questionnaire generally received a list of around ten matches, taking into account their indicated sexual preference.
“Generally we have a lot more straight females than straight males take the survey,” Jackson said. “This year we had about 1,400 straight females versus about 900 straight males.”
Despite Datamatch’s growing popularity, many students said the program lacks the kind of legitimacy found in more expensive and well-known Internet dating sites.
“I would definitely classify it as awkward if someone were to do something with [their Datamatches],” Lauren A. Leon ’12 said.
Shannon M. Conway ’12 added that she felt it would be “ridiculous” to take the results seriously.
“I would never initiate any contact,” she said.
Jackson said Datamatch is more of a “fun thing” for HCS than a serious matchmaking service.
“We don’t know how effective it is,” he said. “It’s definitely beyond me whether it has any additional outside purposes.”
Though Datamatch did not produce immediate on-campus romance for some, many students said they plan to spend Valentine’s Day with their close friends.
After being serenaded by an a capella ensemble for a Valentine’s Day gift from her Kappa Alpha Theta sisters, Paige M. Livingston’ 12 said she planned to go see the new Justin Bieber documentary “Never Say Never.”
Others have chosen a more relaxed approach to the holiday. When asked what he planned to do for Valentine’s Day, Kyle E. Rawding’ 14 said, “Not much. I’m not really acknowledging it.”

Shakira has been named the 2011 Artist of the Year by the Harvard Foundation, according to a press release made public yesterday evening.
The artist will receive her medal during the day-long Cultural Rhythms festival in Sanders Theatre on Feb. 26.
As part of the festivities, 30 student groups will perform at two separate shows that day. Shakira will receive her award at 4 p.m., during the first of the two shows.
The Artist of the Year award is “the Foundation’s most prestigious medal,” according to the press release.
Loc V. Truong, assistant director of the Harvard Foundation, said he did not know whether Shakira would perform during the festival.
During last year’s festival, when Wyclef Jean was named Artist of the Year, the rapper gave a spontaneous performance at the start of the show.
“But we have no expectations at all,” Truong said. “We want them to come and accept the award and enjoy the show.”
According to Truong, the Harvard Foundation looks for artists that are humanitarians, have star power, and understand intercultural relations.
“Harvard is very diverse,” Truong said. “We want to find an artist and humanitarian that appeals to everyone here at Harvard.”
Shakira’s hit “Hips Don’t Lie” topped the charts in 55 countries, and her song “Waka Waka (This Time for Africa),” the theme song for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, became the best-selling World Cup song ever.
She has sold close to 50 million albums worldwide. At the age of 18, Shakira—born Shakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoll—founded the Barefoot Foundation, which provides education and nutrition to children in need.
“Every child has talent to be developed and the potential to become a productive member of society,” Shakira said, according to her website.
Shakira has been a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador since 2003.
Truong said that her humanitarian efforts were the primary reason why she was selected.
Previous recipients of the award include Will Smith, Matt Damon, Halle Berry, and Jackie Chan.
Tickets for the event are available at the Harvard Box Office and on the Harvard Box Office website.

Harvard and Yale’s big men dominated in this weekend’s Ancient Eight action. So rather than recognize just one player, both Crimson junior co-captain Keith Wright and Bulldog junior center Greg Mangano were selected as Ivy League Co-Players of the Week.
As has become routine, Wright had another big weekend for Harvard, scoring 39 points and grabbing 19 boards over two games. While the Leverett House resident played well against Yale, he took his game to a new level the following night against Brown. Along with his five blocks, a career high, Wright led all players with 22 points and 14 rebounds. With his ninth double-double of the season, the Harvard center helped key a big comeback against the Bears.
Wright’s Yale counterpart didn’t have a shabby weekend either. Despite playing only 24 minutes on Friday at Harvard, the 6’10” center scored 19 and, more impressively, was 3-4 from beyond the arc. But like Wright, Mangano’s big game came Saturday night, when he scored a career-high 30 points to lift his Bulldogs to a 69-60 win over Dartmouth.
The two co-players of the week will meet again on Feb. 26, when the Crimson travel south to face off against the Bulldogs at the John J. Lee Amphitheater in New Haven.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Colin West ’10—last year’s No. 1 for the Harvard men’s squash team and 2010 CSA individual champion—graduated last May, he left his successor, freshman Gary Power, with some pretty big shoes to fill.
But Power has proven throughout the season that he can handle the challenge, this past week being no exception.
“It’s definitely hard to follow in his footsteps, but I like the pressure of being number one,” Power said. “I like being able to play tough matches every time.”
In the span of four short days, from last Wednesday to Saturday, Power earned his two greatest victories of the season, defeating the top player of both the No. 2 Yale Bulldogs and the undefeated No. 1 Trinity Bantams.
“He’s a mature young man, very gifted and very competitive,” Crimson coach Mike Way said. “He always gives it one hundred percent. He’s still developing and evolving, and, as each year goes by, he’s going to become a much, much better player.”
Though the Trinity team had just extended its record-setting winning streak to 238 matches, Power remained unshaken by that fact and entered last Wednesday’s match confident and ready to win.
“My whole body felt really good,” Power said. “There was a big crowd there. It was the first time we had a big match at home, so it was definitely really exciting. I was really pumped up and I don’t think the Trinity guy I played was really ready for it.”
Power won the match in four sets. He beat his opponent in the first two sets, 11-6 and 11-7, respectively.
The third set proved to be more of a challenge, and Power lost, 11-9. In the fourth set, despite controversial calls, Power ultimately held on, winning the set, 11-4, and the match, 3-1.
“He really had to hold his composure there, because he nearly let that fourth game slip,” Way said. “[Trinity senior Parth Sharma] came back at him when we thought he was dead and gone. [Gary’s composure is] the sort of thing we’re looking for—maturity. You recognize that something’s slipping and then you make the adjustment, which is what he did mentally and tactically. He ended up getting the job done.”
Power’s victory was one of only three wins Harvard earned last Wednesday against the undefeated Bantams, but his success came as no surprise to his teammates who only expect the best from the talented and hardworking freshman.
“Gary played great squash and took his guy down,” captain Reed Endresen said. “He was just a far better player that night.”
The win put Power in the perfect mindset for the team’s next matchup against Ivy rival Yale, which took place this past Saturday. Power had already played his Bulldog opponent once before in the November Ivy scrimmages and lost, which made Saturday’s match all the more important.
Yet once again, Power did not allow his confidence to become shaken. Instead, he took what he learned from his first match against the Yale sophomore Hywel Robinson and fought even harder to beat his opponent in five matches, 3-2.
In the first set, Power came out strong, winning, 11-6. But after allowing his opponent to take an early lead in both the second and third sets, he followed the initial victory with back to back losses, 11-8 and 11-7, respectively.
Then, in the fourth match, Power overtook his opponent, 11-8, tying the match at two sets apiece.
“You can’t really think the game is over,” Power said. “I’ve played the guy before and he beat me last time, but we’re very close in ability so I knew if I just stuck in there...then I might just pull it out for a win.”
The fifth set was the highlight of the day and kept fans, family members, and friends sitting on their edge of their seats as they watched to see if the young freshman could really make a comeback after suffering two losses in a row.
Power started off the set brilliantly with a 4-0 lead, but couldn’t hold onto it for long. His opponent fought back and tied the score, 9-9. The match would go into extra points and the score would be tied two more times before Power, suddenly taking the lead, 12-11, scored the next and final point to win the set, 13-11.
“It’s very easy, when you’ve lost to someone before, to play well against them the next time and be happy just with the fact that you played well,” Way said. “But [Gary] found a way to win and that was actually a better result than the one against Trinity. [The matches against Trinity and Yale] were both fantastic results, but I thought that [Saturday’s win] was a better result mentally.”
Power owes much of his success this past week to the mental and physical fitness he’s worked hard to develop over the season.
“He’s a total workhorse, always pushing the guys around him to step up. I really enjoyed working with him this year. He’s allowed me to push myself,” said Endresen, who started out at the No.5 spot but moved up to No. 2 after winter break. “He’s definitely the fittest guy on the team. I have the upmost respect for him as a player. “
“He’s got a good shot at winning [the CSA individual championship],” Endresen continued. “He’s proven to everyone that he’s one of the best players in college squash this year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a close victory over Springfield Monday night at Malkin Athletic Center, the Harvard men’s volleyball team (6-1, 0-0 EIVA Hay) has matched its best start since 2000. The Pride (3-9, 0-3 EIVA Tait) battled through four sets, but the Crimson sealed the game with a 32-30 victory thanks to the power plays of outside hitters junior Matt Jones and freshman Chris Gibbons.
“We really need to focus on finishing, but we played really hard out there,” Harvard coach Brian Baise said. “It was good to come out with that win.”
With the score tied at 27, several defensive saves in the next rally failed to win Harvard the point, and Springfield tooled the block to take the lead 28-27.
Jones crushed one into the deep corner, tying the score at 28, and freshman Kyle Rehkemper ended the next offensive set for the Pride with a big block at the net, taking a one point lead.
But Springfield would not back down, as senior Alberto Bravo powered home a big hit to tie it at 29. Two plays later, with the score tied, 30-30, Rehkemper put down the next point, and a line error from Springfield gave the Crimson the match, 32-30.
“It gets very tense out there,” Rehkempser said. “You just [have] to finish.”
Service errors plagued both teams from the very beginning as they exchanged points, struggling to find an offensive rhythm. With the score tied, 19-18, in the first set, Rehkemper sparked the Harvard offense with a powerful kill, and from there on, Jones and Rehkemper led the Crimson to take the set, 25-22.
Harvard started the second game strongly, quickly taking a 10-7 lead. But Springfield, led by Bravo, capitalized on defensive errors from the Crimson to take the lead, 17-15. Harvard rallied late behind an exciting save by Rehkemper, who made a pass off his back off a deflection of Bravo’s serve. Despite getting within one, the Crimson would fall short when several disputed calls landed the Pride the set, 25-20.
Springfield quickly sprang to a 4-2 lead despite blocks from Harvard freshman Michael Owen. Owen continued making big plays at the net as the two teams traded points until the score climbed to 10-8 in favor of the Pride.
A trick play by Owen and Jones then fooled Springfield as Jones powered it away from behind the 6’7” freshman. The Pride committed a hitting error on the next play, but quickly regained its feet and put it away from the middle twice in a row to maintain a three point lead, forcing a Harvard timeout. Coming out of the timeout, the Crimson picked up its defense. Huge blocks from Owen and sophomore Rob Lothman as well as key kills from Jones and Gibbons brought the squad back to 21 all.
“Blocking was key,” Baise said. “Kyle and Michael both played great up front.”
But a missed serve by Jones, followed by a big hit from the Pride, put Springfield up by two. Gibbons answered with two consecutive kills, tying it up once again. The two teams traded points tomake it 24-24, then continued to flip-flop until the Pride pulled ahead 26-27.
Harvard responded when Jones hit a tight angle shot from the outside along the 10 foot line to tie it up. The next play was a long rally with several digs on both sides as well as a few tight net plays. The Crimson won the rally with a touch shot from Jones right over the defense. The game ended with a block from Lothman to win the set, 29-27.
“They had some big servers,” Gibbons said. “But I think all the passers stepped up and we were really able to control their balls, and that’s definitely key for pulling out a win.”
Harvard came out fast in the fourth game with shots from Rehkemper, Owen, and Gibbons putting the Crimson up, 5-2. The lead quickly grew to 8-5, the biggest advantage of the game to that point. But it was short lived, as the Pride began a furious rally that took the game to 30 all. Nevertheless, Harvard pulled it out, 32-30.
“You get anxious out there,” Gibbons added. “Because you’re just trading points back and forth. It’s just whichever team is focused the most and wants it the most, and apparently it was us today.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last night, the Harvard men’s hockey team shocked No. 14 Boston University in the 59th annual Beanpot.
The Crimson (5-18-1, 3-13-1 ECAC) upset the Terriers (14-9-7, 11-5-5 HEA) in the tournament’s consolation game, 5-4. What BU Coach Jack Parker said was an “embarrassing display” makes history as his team finished last for only the fourth time in the history of the tournament and the first time since 1980.
Harvard, the clear underdog in the match, battled back from being down twice in the game. The matchup was full of ups and downs for both teams, but the Crimson came out on top.
“It was a strange game, back and forth, a lot of goals against,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91, “Our guys battled hard, and I was happy with the way they stayed with it.”
The first period started off slowly, with the teams nearly even in shots on goal and time spent in each other’s zones. Both teams were skating well, but a penalty on Harvard was costly.  BU’s top scorer, sophomore Alex Chiasson, netted his own rebound, putting the Terriers up 1-0 just five minutes into the game.
The period ended with a hard hit from behind by Harvard junior Daniel Moriarty, resulting in his ejection from the game and a five minute power play for BU going into the second period.
At the start of the next frame, the Crimson’s leading scorer, junior Alex Killorn, capitalized on a short-handed opportunity, scoring on a feed from sophomore Alex Fallstrom to put Harvard on the board.
The Crimson struck two more times before the Terriers could get their feet back under them. Defenseman Ryan Grimshaw slapped the puck under BU goaltender Kieran Millan just 54 seconds after Harvard’s first goal.
Up by one, the Crimson repeated the passing pattern from Killorn’s first goal to score again 19 seconds later. After the puck once again progressed from sophomore defenseman Danny Biega to Fallstrom, Killorn beat a BU defenseman to keep possession. From the goal line, Killorn managed to sneak another past Millan at a nearly impossible angle. The shot looked as though it would cross in front of the net, but it crossed the goal line to give Harvard the 3-1 advantage.
But even with the lead, the Crimson struggled to stop the Terriers’ strong power play offense in the second half of the period.
“When we were up 3-1, we probably played the worst five minutes of the game,” Donato said.
After Harvard was called on another hit from behind penalty, BU freshman Garrett Noonan lifted the puck over the Crimson’s senior goaltender Ryan Carroll.
Carroll had 45 saves on the night, but couldn’t stop another Terrier goal just 43 seconds later.
By the end of the second period, the game was tied, and the fans for the next game were streaming in for the Beanpot championship, but Harvard and BU were still vying for third place.
The Terrier’s Chiasson found the net again on a power play with about six minutes left to play, making his team 3-for-6 on man-up opportunities and regaining the BU lead.
“We [got] what should have been the winning goal, and then [went] to sleep again,” Parker said.
But what should have been the winning goal was not, thanks to two late Crimson goals in the third period.
Biega tied it up at 4-4 with a shot from the point into a mess of players, sneaking it past Millan with 4:03 on the clock.
Captain Michael Del Mauro then finished off a series of good passes on a rebound from sophomore Connor Morrison’s shot to bring the Crimson into the lead with just over two minutes left.
“[Del Mauro’s] work ethic and commitment to the team are unmatched,” Donato said. “I couldn’t be happier for him—he deserves it.”
With the game on the line, the Terriers pulled their goalie for an extra man on the ice, but the sixth skater could not put one past Carroll.
In an unusually high-scoring matchup, the nine goals scored certainly made it entertaining for the small crowd that came out early for the consolation game.
Visibly displeased, Parker commented on the disappointing play of the BU team.
“That win doesn’t mean a lot to Harvard, but that loss means an awful lot to us,” he said.
On the contrary, the review from the Crimson’s players was overwhelmingly positive.
“There’s always some sentiment that it’s the last time we’re playing in the Beanpot, so it’s hard, but winning the last game is something that really does feel great,” Del Mauro said. “Knowing that the team is moving in the right direction is something that feels even better. And you know hopefully next year these guys will be playing in the big game.”
Coming off a string of losses, Harvard has recently been playing better than its record suggests.
“We’ve been playing some very good hockey and not getting the results we wanted,” Del Mauro said. “This finally translated into success.”
“We had a little bit of a tough go, but things are starting to click,” Biega added. “And today was really big moving forward.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard women’s water polo ended its 2010 season with its second consecutive bid to the Eastern Championship—obviously, the Crimson’s formula was working.
But this season, the girls threw out the old and rebuilt the team from scratch with a brand new coaching staff.
Last summer, the Department of Athletics hired Ted Minnis to double as the head coach of the men’s and women’s water polo teams. Among other qualifications, Minnis served as head water polo and swimming coach at Castilleja School in Palo Alto, Calif. and was named the USA Water Polo Development Coach of the Year in 2007.
He led the men’s team to a 12-16 finish this fall and will look to build upon the success that the women had last season under Erik Farrar, who resigned in May.
The change was hardly the last, and the water polo coaching staff was restructured again midway through the men’s season when assistant coach Jessi Wood was added to the staff. For Wood, who coached with Minnis at Castilleja School for two years, the launch of the women’s water polo season marks her first full season coaching a Harvard squad.
“The changes have been wonderful,” junior attacker Monica Zdrojewski said. “It’s incredible to be able to play and love to play again. We’re getting so much done, learning so much and we’re meshing so well together as a team…thanks to the new coaches.”
Aside from the major changes at the top, the Crimson also added five freshmen to their lineup, and the Class of 2014 is already making an impact. On opening day, the freshman class scored a combined 18 goals in their first contest as collegiate athletes.
Although the adjustments are significant and the formula was reworked, Harvard’s undefeated season so far shows that change can be good.

Although freshmen will not learn their housing assignments until March 10, Dunster and Quincy have already created teasers based on two of this past year's most popular movies, "The Social Network" and "Inception."
With all the hype in Hollywood and at Harvard surrounding "The Social Network," it's no surprise that Dunster used it as inspiration for their video, mirroring the original trailer. Instead of featuring generic Facebook pages and Jesse Eisenberg, Dunster's version stars the Facebook profile of the House's moose mascot. According to the trailer, "you don’t get to 500 million real friends unless you're in Dunster," making Dunster not only a fun place to be, but also the third most populous country in the world.
 
Quincy went with a surreal approach to housing day with a video called "Quinception." Featuring dramatic background music and a remake of the rotating hallway scene from "Inception," the video is mysterious, telling viewers that "your house is the scene of the party." But what about a party within a party? With all the confusion and drama that surrounds housing day in the first place, let's hope students' experiences don't mimic the plot of "Inception."
 
Will other houses go with movie-themed videos or try a different take? With housing day approaching quickly, the answer will probably be revealed soon.
