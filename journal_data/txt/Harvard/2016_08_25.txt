After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dear Dean Elmendorf,
As Harvard alumni, we are concerned by Maggie Williams, former Chief of Staff to First Lady Hillary Clinton and campaign manager for Mrs. Clinton’s 2008 Presidential run, keeping her ongoing role official role as Director of the Harvard Institute of Politics while she helps to lead and organize Mrs. Clinton's transition team. Although she has taken unpaid leave for this purpose, this conflict of interest is troubling to us.
We know the Kennedy School of Government places great value on the real diversity of ideas stemming from a bipartisan and independent learning environment. We all benefit when Harvard's Institute of Politics is viewed as a premier forum for everyone. When Ms. Williams was hired, the Kennedy School leaders made clear that she was finished with partisan politics and would work with both sides of political aisle. Her desire now to go back in to the political fight forces us to therefore call for her immediate resignation and for you to appoint a new director with deference to all political views.
Without this clean break, the Institute of Politics’ will forfeit a truly independent and free discussion for this fall’s spirited U.S. Presidential debate between Ms. Williams’ boss and Donald J. Trump.
Sincerely,
Sean P.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following the announcement that Institute of Politics Director Margaret A. “Maggie” Williams will take a temporary unpaid leave of absence to work on Hillary Clinton’s transition team, a handful of alumni have called for her to step down, citing concerns over her ability to remain nonpartisan.
In a letter published in The Crimson and addressed to Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf, a group of 15 University alumni—including Sean P. David, associate professor of medicine at Stanford, and Richard A. Grenell, a former U.S. spokesperson at the United Nations—wrote that Williams’s decision to join “the political fight forces us to therefore call for her immediate resignation.”
“Although she has taken unpaid leave,” the signatories wrote that “this conflict of interest” between Williams’s nonpartisan role at the IOP and her political appointment “is troubling.”
The Clinton campaign announced last Tuesday that Williams, a longtime ally of the Democratic presidential nominee, will be a co-chair of Clinton’s White House transition team, a type of committee generally tasked with ensuring the candidate can make the potential move from from campaigning to governing as seamlessly as possible. While on the transition team, Williams will take an unpaid leave from her position as IOP director, and is expected to return after the end of the current calendar year.
Kennedy School spokesperson Doug Gavel wrote in an emailed statement that Williams will begin her unpaid leave of absence starting Oct. 1, but “in the meantime she will be working with the IOP team to allow for an orderly leadership transition while she is on leave.”
“Maggie Williams has an accomplished record in public service, and her experience working in the White House for two presidential administrations is widely known,” Gavel said. “[I]t provides her with a unique perspective to work with students at the IOP.”
Some student leaders said they do not believe Williams’s new position will compromise her ability to be nonpartisan at the IOP.
Kathryn A. Bussey ’17, president of the IOP’s Student Advisory Committee, said that Williams has remained nonpartisan in the past, and that Williams and the IOP are taking measures to ensure the Institute will remain nonpartisan going forward.
“My understanding is… Maggie is intending to adhere closely to Dean Elmendorf’s recommendation of her temporary leave,” Bussey said. “My experiences have been that Maggie has dedicated an effort to upholding the nonpartisan nature of the IOP.”
Bussey also said that she and the Student Advisory Committee’s executive team will still communicate regularly with Williams “as deemed appropriate given the upholding of the nonpartisan nature of the IOP.”
In an email obtained by The Crimson, Bussey wrote to other members of the IOP’s student leadership last Thursday that “Maggie will still operate in an advisory capacity to the IOP since she is planning to return after leading the transition team,” and that “she will be as involved as the Dean deems appropriate given her partisan role in the "still-political" Clinton transition.”
“Any advice or oversight she has, to my understanding, will be largely informal as the transition team’s work ramps up,” Bussey added in an interview.
Declan P. Garvey ’17, president of the Harvard Republican Club and a member of the IOP’s Fellows Selection Committee, also said he was largely unconcerned about Williams’s decision to join the transition team and her partisan background.
“Being in politics is inherently a partisan job, and I think that the IOP has been better served by having someone who has actual experience in campaigns and in the trenches,” Garvey said.
Garvey cited previous IOP Director C. M. Trey Grayson ’94, a Republican and former Kentucky Secretary of State, and two of this semester’s fellows—Sarah M. Isgur Flores, who served as deputy campaign manager for former Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina and David Kochel, who was the senior strategist for former Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush—as what he considered evidence that the IOP remains nonpartisan.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Michael R. Bloomberg has committed $32 million to create an executive education program for mayors and mayoral aides in collaboration with Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government and Business School, the Kennedy School announced on Thursday.
The $32 million gift from Bloomberg Philanthropies, a foundation run by the three-term New York City Mayor and a 1966 Business School graduate, will fund the Bloomberg Harvard City Leadership Initiative for the next four years. Jorrit de Jong, a lecturer at the Kennedy School, will lead the program, and as many as 300 mayors and 400 aides are expected to participate over the course of the program.
The program is centered around four executive education programs, according to de Jong, which provide classes for professionals already established in their field to help them improve at what they do.
“We have thousands of public sector executives and private sector executives every year but there was no comprehensive program for mayors, for city leaders, so that’s the centerpiece,” de Jong said in an interview. 
The $32 million will go to a “wide array of activities from research to curriculum development, [to] fellowships for students,” de Jong said. The whole program will be free for the mayors themselves, so no public funds will be spent enrolling the elected officials.
In a press release, University President Drew G. Faust called the program “a vitally important opportunity to advance the understanding of urban issues and to work with mayors and other public officials to bring discoveries from university research into communities across the nation and around the world.”
Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf, in the press release, added that the program’s “goal is to enable innovative leadership, and to foster lifelong networks that will serve them and their citizens for decades to come.”
In addition, the program will create internship positions for students in mayors’ offices, provide research about city government, and create mentoring opportunities that will allow more experienced mayors to coach and work with new city leaders.
“We do student internships in mayors’ offices that can help the mayors to implement new practices that they’ve learned about in the program,” de Jong said. “And of course that’s a double-edged sword because it’s an experiential learning opportunity for students.”
Bloomberg has directed most of his donations toward his undergraduate alma mater, Johns Hopkins University, where, as of 2013, he had given $1.1 billion over the past 40 years. However, Bloomberg has already left his mark on Harvard: The Bloomberg Center at the Business School’s Baker Library is named after his father, and in 2014, he gave Harvard's Commencement address.
Bloomberg’s gift is part of Harvard’s capital campaign, according to Kennedy spokesperson Doug Gavel. Harvard surpassed its record-breaking $6.5 billion fundraising goal, but continues to fundraise for still-unfulfilled priorities.
