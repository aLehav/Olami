After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Class of 2021 now prepares to receive its degrees and set forth into a world so startlingly different from 2017, when they arrived in Cambridge. It might therefore be appropriate to pause and give a salute to its centennial forbear — the extraordinary class of 1921 — and reflect upon some startling similarities, as well as differences, between their times and challenges. Both the 1921 and 2021 classes arrived at Harvard as epic events were unfolding that would forever alter the students’ lives, the University, the nation, and the world.
On October 10, 1917, just after the Class of 1921 had first entered campus, The Harvard Crimson gave voice to the supreme confidence of the New England upper-class students who dominated campus culture with an almost europhile gaiety as America buoyantly entered the fierce and cataclysmic First World War. “I am mighty glad I am here,” wrote back an enlisted upperclassman who viewed the conflict as “the greatest cause the world has known. From the frontlines, he observed: “This war is like a football game on a large scale.” For the Class of 1921, however, this exuberance soon gave way to analytical sobriety as news of the devastating loss of Harvard upperclassmen arrived back on campus from the bloody trenches crisscrossing France.
In 1918, yet another catastrophe would sweep the Harvard campus. In a fashion that only current students could relate to, the raging pandemic of the Spanish flu further depleted Harvard’s classrooms. Fortunately for most this was only temporary, but it permanently increased the psychic sobriety that marked the Class of 1921 and served as a new model of Harvard’s culture. By the end of their sophomore year, the class had begun to focus far more on serious meritorious educational achievement than their more dilettante preceding classes. The Belle Epoque was over. There was a complex, burgeoning technological nation to build, and they would be some of its builders.
Just as racial progress has been in our hearts and minds this past year, in 1917, when only one in one thousand black people held a college degree, four Black students entering the Class of 1921 would represent the rising spirit of “The New Negro” surging across America, determined to achieve racial equality.
For these four, the added burden of four years of unspoken, systemic racial isolation would produce serious group discussions in their brilliant ad hoc society they called the Nile Club. There, frustrations found resolution in incisive analyses of the rising nationwide attacks on Black communities — including the 1921 demolition of the Black community in Tulsa, Oklahoma that had been an exemplar of Black economic success.
Farrow Allen, Class of 1923 (who entered with the Class of 1921), wanted to prepare for a career in medicine in New York City’s Black Harlem metropolis. He would forge ahead to Harvard Medical School and a lifetime of medical practice as a surgeon throughout Harlem’s most glorious era.
Leo Hansberry, Class of 1921, arrived from small-town Mississippi determined to plumb the racist axioms of anthropology extant even among the famous faculty at Harvard’s renowned Peabody Museum. He would spend a lifetime on meticulous research that would finally recognize more than four thousand years of undeniable Black civilizational impact and emphasize the equal potential of African peoples. The preeminent African history scholar of his time, he would teach Black youth from around the world the rich details of their past at Howard University. Near the end of his life, he would receive grateful recognition for his work, including the first Haile Selassie Prize, and the Hansberry Institute of African Studies at the University of Nigeria, named in his honor by his former student and Nigeria’s first president, Nnamdi Azikiwe.
Also from the Deep South’s Jacksonville, Florida, Ned Gourdin, a Black and Native American multi-sports high school phenomenon in the Class of 1921, arrived determined to become a lawyer. He would become a lifelong hero of his class: a national 100-yard dash and pentathlon champion, and the holder of a world record-breaking 25 feet 3 inches long jump — a feat that would stand as the Harvard record for 93 years, through 2014 — and winner of a silver medal at the 1924 Olympics. He would become a lawyer, assistant United States attorney, a National Guard general, and a Massachusetts Superior Court judge.
From the renowned abolitionist city of New Bedford, Massachusetts, 17-year-old Class of 1921 member Edwin B. Jourdain, Jr.’s thoughts centered on service to the cause of racial equality. Jourdain’s devastating editorials in The Crimson on racial injustice generated widespread outrage at campus conditions. His convictions led him to attend Harvard Business School and then to reform-minded newspaper journalism, where his incisive arguments against Jim Crow led political leadership towards an era of startling successful desegregation in Evanston, Illinois. A letter of appreciation for his life’s work from Harvard also came.
A possibly unprecedented number of the entire Class of 1921 would in fact modernize a myriad of American business sectors ranging from revolutionary high tech materials, to revolutions in print media, building modern retail merchandising empires to modern business insurance. They accomplished these advancements having been shaped by sobering realities, not unlike those of the present-day: despite immense tragedy, a pandemic, and the need to rebuild on a truly global scale. And, for these four Black and Native American students especially, despite an America of grossly unjust opportunity and minuscule rewards. Their lives continue to shine bright — having forged a great leap forwards in America towards equal rights and fulfillment of individual potential.
As a member of the Class of 1961 — a midpoint between your classes — looking proudly upon the both of you, my hope is that the current graduates can learn a profound message from these glimpses of centennial forebears: That after your graduation the Class of 2021, despite your own historic challenges, will bring outstanding service to the nation and honor to Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I grew up in inner-city Columbus, Ohio, and attended Northland High School, where fear and struggle were students’ primary motivations. When I look back, I realize just how unhealthy it was for me to understand that I would never want my own children to live in an environment like mine at the very time that I was living there. No one should have to live in a place where their friends are subject to being murdered, where flying bullets often mark their parties, or where the bullets that miss their bodies still puncture their understanding of their self-worth.
Most of us simply wanted to make it out of this situation. Some of us wanted desperately to change it from within. None of us ever really questioned why a situation filled with violence and suffering existed at all.
It is not a question I considered until I arrived at Harvard. For the first time, I was part of a community where the absence of a socioeconomic burden was possible. I often hung out with folks from privileged situations but endlessly found myself peeking over white picket fences, examining the variety of luxurious cadences and dispositions performed by these individuals. Predictably, I never found myself able to assimilate, for my heart was with my brothers and sisters back home. My father manually installed a white fence in our backyard when I was a boy. He knew it could not save me from the violence that would later rupture me and the people I loved. I was doomed, inevitably and immeasurably.
I soon realized that those luxurious dispositions displayed by my privileged peers did not symbolize freedom — because they were on the opposite pole did not intrinsically mean they were in a fundamentally ideal situation. Instead, it was the freedom to exist without the aforementioned burdens perpetually looming in every bat of my eyes that I found most illuminating. I was able to wonder in ways I had never wondered, venture places that would remain distant potentialities for those back home.
This gnawed at me more than anything — knowing and feeling the freedom that was out there and not being able to simply give it to the people I loved. It was because of this realization — which came around the end of my time at Harvard — that I ultimately decided to address the question that had been quietly waiting for me: Why do these conditions exist?
Such a simple question requires one to be both analytical of the world and ever-critical of the structures which create it. For oppressed peoples, it establishes, as Paulo Freire calls it, “conscientization,” or the process of learning and understanding one’s oppression and subsequently learning how to fight it. However, no matter your age, background, or societal position, you are never too far from harsh realities to be critical of the forces at play.
For those who benefit from a repressive system, be brave enough to reckon with a system that imposes violence and perpetual suffering unto others. The questions are clear and ready to be asked (For example, why do Black and third-world peoples suffer while others do not? What must be done to liberate them?). We must do everything we can to solve them. Lives are, quite literally, at stake.
It took me wrestling with this question to realize that the conditions only reflect the social systems within which they exist. In the year since I graduated from Harvard, I have been to numerous public protests (at one of which I was detained), kneeled for the national anthem before my team’s basketball games (as I now play for Ohio State University), and, most recently, started a book club with the goals of reading texts that are critical of oppressive structures and dynamics, and engaging in liberating discourse. All of these efforts were in the name of challenging and rejecting a system that has caused immense suffering for my loved ones and me. Yet, the reality of oppressive conditions is visible to all. It is up to each of us to change them.

After being fractured for almost 18 months, the Harvard College student body will finally descend upon Cambridge this coming fall, reunited as a whole. For some students, the upcoming semester will take the form of a homecoming, for others, an introduction. What rings true for all, however, is that the end of our exile provides the opportunity for what might be the sharpest cultural reset that Harvard College has ever seen.
By the time we all set foot back in the Square, our collective idea of how it feels to be a Harvard student will be hazy at best. Some of us may have lived in the Yard or the Houses for parts of this academic year, but with physical gathering so heavily restricted and such a small percentage of students in Cambridge, what meaning, if any, has the notion of “campus culture” carried this year? When we return, only one class, the rising seniors, will have spent a full year on campus: Only a quarter of students will have been to Yardfest, attended the Houses’ spring formals, and watched our campus thaw from the bitter winter.
Harvard College’s institutional cultural memory is hanging by a thread. This reality, while a reminder of what has been lost over the past year and half, also holds the great potential to reshape campus culture. Now is the time to interrogate what might have discolored the Harvard student experience in the past, and to explore how we might resolve these issues moving forward. At the same time, we have been handed a chance to reflect on what we cherished about campus life in the past, and to identify what we wish to reignite, kindle, and sustain moving forward.
Indeed, we are the architects of post-pandemic Harvard. Instead of accepting whatever new campus forms passively, now is the time to determine which structures to tear down and which to build up.
After being torn from our lives on campus or leading solitary existences in the dorms, many of us have been longing for the social interactions we associate with in-person Harvard. But living on campus, surrounded by hundreds of peers, can still be lonely.
Too often, our relationships at Harvard are transactional, based on what one person can offer another: help with problem sets, access to elite social circles, and networking opportunities in the future. Yet, such empty, transactional ties demonstrate a deep-seated disconnect between the relationships that most of us need and those that we actually tend to form.
While by no means characterizing all friendships at Harvard, this transactionality seems to be a norm, and it is incredibly easy to feel deeply, deeply alone. But the past year — spent maintaining our most genuine friendships over distance and helping each other navigate the pain wrought by the pandemic — has taught us a great deal about authenticity, compassion, and true friendship, which we must now draw upon.
During the pandemic, it became normal to not feel normal. Between awkward Zoom silences, we told peers calling in from across the globe that our pandemic-dominated weeks, like theirs, have been difficult and draining. When we were finally able to have serendipitous run-ins with friends on the street, we skipped the plastered smiles and fake defenses. In this world of uncertainty and distance, many of us have found ourselves with little energy to waste pushing falsity in our interactions; we have somehow become closer and more real.
Soon, the pixelated screens, and even the masks, may disappear; but the way we conceptualize relationships at Harvard need not go back to the old normal. Instead of eschewing conversations with distant acquaintances, let’s get way too candid. Rather than climbing social ladders, let’s sit and laugh together (or collectively cry, if it’s a bad day). Above all else, let’s look for authenticity in our connections — because, at Harvard and beyond, we all have the most to gain from simply being real.
While striving for more genuine, honest relationships will take us far towards a warmer campus culture when we return, there are still social and institutional structures in place at Harvard that can contribute to a cruel campus.
For most, forming relationships starts with getting involved in campus extracurriculars. This mandate becomes particularly challenging within Harvard’s gates, where joining organizations often first entails undergoing a competitive comp process. This particular experience — a token of Harvard life in which students must earn their membership to a given extracurricular group — inherently breeds discord.
As we push for coveted club memberships, we measure ourselves up against our peers, and external tensions simmer. As we get sucked in by shallow markers of success, we forget about the interests and passions that drew us to a given group in the first place. And when we fail by these subjective standards, inward pressures seethe. In their elitism and selectiveness, groups like final clubs tend to epitomize this culture; such selective and elitist comp and punch processes dignify the idea of an in-group and out-group, and a hierarchy of students.
This hyper-competitive extracurricular culture then intermixes with daunting academic pressures, often turning the campus into a pressure cooker. Students pull all-nighters to meet deadlines, attend class while feeling sick, and sacrifice their mental well-being to adhere to a syllabus. We often forget how to take care of ourselves, or how to just be ourselves.
But during the pandemic, many of us felt these tight, cutthroat pressures loosen their grip — particularly within the classroom, where previously immutable course requirements were made more flexible at a large scale across the College. Deadlines were softened due to the extraordinary circumstances. Extensions were often offered more liberally. Office hours were made more accessible. Absences and lateness were treated with profound understanding and care.
While such offerings were appreciated — and enormously necessary — during the pandemic, it is troubling that it took such dire circumstances for these provisions to become normalized. Personal, individual-level struggles and catastrophes have been affecting students’ lives long before the pandemic started, and will continue to do so afterwards. This is particularly the case when it comes to students with uniquely challenging circumstances — first generation, low income students, students who need accommodations, students who have disabilities, and beyond — that make academic survival disproportionately difficult. With this in mind, our goal should be to become more accommodating and understanding all the time, not only in moments of universal crisis and mass tragedy.
Harvard’s cutthroat culture creates a dynamic in which it becomes all too easy to abandon compassion and inclusivity. When we return, eliminating the competitive comps and retaining the academic flexibility can help reduce the pressure, and make it easier for students to breathe.
We can base our cultural reset on humanism and compassion, starting on an individual scale: We can interpersonally be more open. We can relish our peers’ insights, and fight the urge to be constantly critical. We can redefine what it means to be successful, recalibrating our standards to understand that the greatest feat of all would be cultivating a truly unifying college experience — one that’s just as inviting as it is enriching.
With Covid-19 vaccines distributed and mask mandates lifted, the world has become more eager than ever to resume their normal, pre-pandemic lives. While the idea of a full return to campus has become synonymous with a return to normalcy, many students do not know what a normal year at Harvard looks like. As Harvard welcomes the Class of 2025, it will have to reorient the rest of its population as well. With the Class of 2024 never having stepped foot into Harvard’s physical classrooms and the Class of 2023 returning after an abruptly truncated freshman year, Harvard has to do more than return to normal.
For our part as students, we must take seriously the responsibility of establishing a new and improved campus culture — but we need the University to help us repair the tear the pandemic has caused in campus life.
Harvard must help its students come home: We will need a deliberate and thoughtful reorientation process, not only for its freshmen. The College should make an effort to reweave the social fabric with events and gatherings, and help the senior class preserve the quirky traditions that characterize Yard and House life.
Upperclassmen coming back must pass their torch, teaching the underclassmen how to properly enjoy the Harvard-Yale Game and the hype for Housing Day, appease the River Gods, and yes, run around naked for Primal Scream.
In preserving our favorite old traditions, our return in the fall need not discard the new habits and activities that we have developed during the pandemic. In fact, we should defend any newfound sense of self the pandemic has brought us, and new tricks we may have learned along the way. We should not lose sight of the importance of taking care of ourselves and the world around us, even as the days shorten and the assignments lengthen.
So, let’s not go back to normal. Let’s be thoughtful, and use our hard reset — a once-in-a-385-year-history chance — deliberately to create a new normal in a warmer, more compassionate Harvard College.

Harvard — halls empty, dorms half full — has operated in crisis mode for over a year now.
A former Dean of Students once quipped that Harvard University would “close only for an act of God, such as the end of the world;” a quote we’ve mulled over since our March 10, 2020 mass exodus from Cambridge. This flight marked our first exposure to Harvard’s wartime persona; the version of our university that, in response to a once-in-a-century crisis, did and became something new — a Covid test administrator, Community Compact enforcer, and en masse iPad lender, to name a few.
Through its response to the “act of God” that leveled us, we’ve seen what Harvard is capable of — and willing to do — during a crisis.
Yet the coronavirus, while arguably the most visible global catastrophe in recent history, is not the only crisis this world and university are facing. Amidst the pandemic’s storm, an explosive reckoning on racial injustice, political turmoil, and the encroaching threat of climate change have punctured the last year, with all festering long before it.
Those of us who, on a dime, fled our physical campus and became Zoom disciples overnight know the previously unimaginable sacrifices Harvard can make when it wants to. But Harvard’s response to this crisis begs comparison to its handling of others. So much careening, urgent catastrophe was stuffed into this school year: the murder of George Floyd, our generation’s Emmett Till, an electoral crisis preceded by repeated presidential flirtations with autocracy, and the ever-upping-ante of the climate crisis.
Wartime Harvard had many fronts to fight on. It largely chose one.
From the outset of the pandemic, the University has taken a conservative approach to its handling of public health: Protect health first, figure everything else out later. Some moves — like the development of robust testing infrastructure and requirements for affiliates — have been simple but sharp. Through their specificity and stunningly good execution, measures like these have served as clear markers of the University’s commitment to communal safety and, plainly, keeping us alive.
Other actions have been more jolting — sending all students home with five days notice, and bringing back only one full class of students in the fall 2020 semester. These decisions garnered shock, dismay, and uproar. Their announcement could have been much smoother. Yet, unquestionably, time has proven them to be the right ones.
This is no small win. Whereas other universities were Covid hotspots — infecting students, staff, and the communities in which they’re implanted — Harvard wasn’t. Here, we have to give it up to our school which (yes, in part due to its handsome endowment) exhibited foresight, vigilance, and caution amidst a patchwork of collegiate approaches, some of which proved fatally poor.
And yet, this strong focus on campuswide health also took on extreme, pernicious manifestations at times; ones which caused punishing isolation that, at its worst, threatened to turn lethal itself.
Our community’s mental health has taken an extreme blow over the past year. We’ve been forced to opine on the subject numerous times, offering preemptive solutions, grieving irreparable losses, and trying to disentangle a pervasive crisis that both precedes and has been worsened by this pandemic.
One might have expected Harvard’s wartime vision to expand the inextricably linked psycho-emotional crisis Covid precipitated when it dislocated us from our campus home and support systems and violently flung many into crushingly isolated living. A radical increase in funding for mental health services seems sensible.
We wish a deep creative reimagining of how to best serve war-torn students materialized. Instead, our administration simply did too little. Condescending explanations about rising to the challenge are the most tangible of responses to emerge. Our instruction breaks, crucial at a time of blurring personal and academic lines and Zoom-induced fatigue, were replaced by disappointing and clumsily implemented Wellness Days that left most of us lukewarm at best. Worst of all, our Counseling and Mental Health Services failed to even attempt to support those who were unable or unwilling to enroll, disappointed many who did, and, to top it all off, told Asian American students dealing with a surge of pandemic-linked racial hatred that their “ancestors” suffering meant it’d all come out in the wash.
This past school year, the academic leniency of our first Covid-tinged semester vanished and, as students were expected to proceed with business as usual amid chaos, we suffered. This suffering, brought to the University’s attention via stunning, depressing statistics, was a crisis Wartime Harvard failed to meet, or even earnestly acknowledge.
Over the past year, Harvard and the rest of the country have been forced to reckon with the crushing nature of racism; awakened by murders which (brutally, oddly, maddeningly, effectively?) went viral and stirred something in the unaware. And while the murders of Black people at the hands of what is ultimately an entrenched system of white supremacy should have 1) not even been needed and 2) been more than enough to elicit decisive action against racism akin to those Harvard took for the sake of public health — of course, it wasn’t. Harvard’s response to the harrowing deaths, protests, and trauma of the past year was instead characterized by vague promises to “stand with” community members of color — promises which were broken on multiple occasions.
In the wake of a series of racist online remarks allegedly made by Government preceptor David Kane, Harvard chose to preserve Kane’s employment over the trust and well-being of its students of color. Apparently, the instructor’s supposed defense of Neo-Nazis and embrace of racial eugenics didn’t even warrant confirmation or denial by the University. Just a few months later, Harvard denied tenure to Cornel West, a pillar of the African American Studies department and one of the most respected Black intellectuals of our time; then, frantically offered it in the face of controversy. Only a handful of weeks after that, as community members mourned those lost in the Atlanta spa shootings along with the other victims of a yearlong increase in anti-Asian hate crimes, the aforementioned, blatantly insensitive, now-infamous advice from the University’s mental health services — “You may wish that you weren’t Asian, but remember that your ancestors likely went through similar or even worse incidents” — only further exacerbated the harm imposed on Asian students during this traumatic time.
Harvard failed to address issues of racial justice within its faculty, its curriculum, or its student body, even when opportunities for the University to demonstrate its support to communities of color were presented on a silver platter. Aside from an arsenal of well-meaning but ultimately toothless emails from deans, as the Black Lives Matter movement prompted institutional change elsewhere, Harvard’s Black students were left waiting for their University to care.
There is no easy or right way to be an anti-racist institution, but after the failures of this past year, it is imperative that Harvard apply the same wartime approach to the pandemic of racism as it has to the threat of Covid-19. The time for incrementalism and emailed platitudes is over. Only the possibility of radical change remains. When the news cycle moves on to a new tragedy, as it numbingly already has, Harvard must prove its sustained commitment to communities of color even out of the spotlight — because for students and faculty of color, the “war” against racism is never truly over. Beyond its current and at times admirable work in reckoning with its racist past, Harvard must also look to building a more just and equitable future. The construction of a multicultural center on campus and the establishment of an ethnic studies department are good and necessary places to start — even if both are, at this point, painfully overdue.
Speaking of overdue, during this trying year, our sometimes annoyingly apolitical institution has been pushed into the national political arena.
Early on in our public health nightmare — at some point between the initial toilet paper shortage and the eventual emergence of mask-burning — our university chose to take a brave stance for the sake of our international peers. In the face of draconian, cruel, and unnecessary migration restrictions that would have prevented international students from residing in the United States if their courses were fully online (as many were for the duration of the pandemic) Harvard spoke up. We did so in a dramatically effective, distinctly Harvard way: The University, along with our fellow Cantabrigians at MIT, sued the federal government and legally intimidated the Department of Homeland Security so swiftly that the restrictions were promptly dropped before the suit could reach trial.
That victory alone is meaningful and worth celebrating and exhibits a more than welcome degree of political prowess and ambition. Yet our board (our institution, perhaps) isn’t known for leaving things with a pat on the back. Harvard has now flexed its political muscle, and we’re eager to see them do so again. We want more of our administration making us proud through being both effective and morally courageous.
We might urgently need them to do so very soon. The Supreme Court will decide within weeks whether to take up the anti-affirmative action suit brought by Students For Fair Admissions against Harvard for our race-conscious admissions system. If it does, our brave efforts to defend racial diversity in our student body will face its biggest challenge yet. We can only wait anxiously and hope that Harvard, once again, rises to the occasion.
This year’s clear demonstration of Harvard’s full political potential only makes our shortfalls more glaringly obvious. We are still puzzled and annoyed by our university’s refusal to accept roughly $16 million worth of federal relief funds, as we simultaneously threw contracted Harvard workers under the suddenly-unemployed-in-the-midst-of-a-pandemic bus citing financial strain. Here, we bowed to political pressure dished out to score anti-elite points rather than in good faith and showcased Harvard’s glaring disparity in how it dignifies students versus staff.
This year has also been marked by Harvard’s continued commitment to not divest from fossil fuels, despite growing pressure from a majority of students and faculty. Climate change is arguably the most existential crisis of our generation, fundamentally changing the planet as we know it and upending billions of lives across the globe. Harvard must divest and take action against the threat of climate change which signals to other institutions the importance of divesting in order to protect current and future generations from climate change. The conundrum of Harvard continuing to invest, literally, in a fossil-fueled future it simultaneously claims it means to eradicate cannot stand any longer, particularly as peers like Oxford University and Yale University set themselves to divestment.
Harvard has acted swiftly and effectively against another existential threat this year. So why can’t our institution do the same for climate change? There’s no vaccine for the corporate greed that underpins our clawing financial dalliance with fossil fuels. Perhaps the University does not view climate change as an immediate danger (yet?) whereas Covid presented itself as something immediately large and looming. Climate change has this same potential: Through its calamities, lives will be changed forever and people will face irreparable harm. They already are. We hope Harvard, already too late to lead, recognizes this crisis’s urgency before it is too late.
During this past torturous, unprecedented, winding, trying, dramatic, revealing, and, above all, long year, Harvard has been tested: stretching to accommodate newfound responsibilities and — sometimes necessarily, sometimes glaringly not — abdicating others.
The pandemic has shown us that our dear and often doggedly bureaucratic institution can act decisively in response to challenges it deems urgent enough. On Covid, we applaud Harvard. With the end near, it seems we can start to let our guard and masks down. But issues beyond the immediate, and beyond pure life and death, also raise to the level of crisis.
Harvard has made clear it can move mountains. Our university’s usual role as a passive spectator to the crises beyond its ivory tower, and its reluctance to engage thornier issues at home, are conscious, changeable choices. A campus where workers aren’t paid embarrassing wages, not funded by environmental carnage, and one where racism is addressed head-on, not swept under the rug, can come to be if Harvard acts as it has shown it is able to throughout the pandemic. Failing to do so in the future — acting like all pain beyond catching Covid is somehow acceptable — would constitute an unacceptable denial of the agency we know Harvard has.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Congratulations, Class of 2021! You have endured the most difficult year with grace, humility, and patience. Over the past year, you’ve developed skills to persevere and thrive. These new skills, along with the resiliency you’ve demonstrated, will take you far in the next chapters of your lives and careers. As you begin embarking on your next journey, it’s important to sit in this moment and celebrate everything you have achieved and overcome this year. This is your moment to cherish. It is also a moment of reflection.
This year has taught us many important lessons. While I hope you carry all of these lessons with you moving forward, there are a certain few that are critical to navigating the world you are entering.
First, go together and lean on one another. One of the hardest lessons to learn for many people, myself included for a long time, is that you don’t have to do the work alone. That can mean many things: It can mean keeping your community close, being part of a larger network, and collaborating with others to achieve personal and professional goals. I couldn’t have pursued my dreams alone. I was lucky to have family, chosen family, and a wider community supporting me during each step as I maneuvered through high school and eventually law school. Now, asking for help and working across departments and sectors has helped me during my time as mayor. For all the things I wanted to achieve during my first term as mayor, my team at the City of Cambridge helped create pathways for those passions to come to life. You, too, haven’t walked this path alone — you’ve relied on your classmates, advisors, professors, and perhaps family to get to this point. Recognize these contributions and know your continued success will require you to continue maintaining those relationships, building new ones, and leaning on others.
Second, follow your passions and keep equity in mind. Your class is full of graduates completing their time at Harvard with degrees in a variety of concentrations, including Computer Science; Art, Film, and Visual Studies; African and African American Studies; Economics; and so many more. I want you to remember the reasons you chose your concentration and invest your hard work into careers and opportunities that further that passion. While you are doing this, take note of who is not at the table, and utilize your skills and privilege to continue to promote equity in the workplace and in everyday life. You’ve earned a seat at the table, and I hope you use your new positions of power in advocating for additional seats for our most marginalized community members.
Lastly, be civically involved. Over this past year, you’ve witnessed both a public health crisis and racial equity crisis unfold together and separately. In both instances, you’ve gained a deeper understanding of the many inequities that permeate the world around us — in our schools, workplaces, streets, and healthcare systems. You mustn’t turn away. You’ve worked hard to develop your mind and get a degree from a prestigious university. Please use both to stay civically engaged and show up for your neighbors in need or stand up to injustice. Use the voice and mind you’ve developed over the past four years to advocate for others in your community.
I wish I could say you’ve done the hardest part, but the hard work is just beginning. I hope you take the time to celebrate this moment and be proud of your amazing accomplishment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Commencement, our Editorial Board faced a conundrum: How could we summarize the past three months — suddenly fleeing campus, quarantining in our homes, coping with a new virus both world-stopping and unknown — through a collective voice, when what ultimately unfolded for each of us was a deeply personal experience?
We couldn’t. Any single narrative would be reductive, and any attempt to capture all perspectives in one voice would dilute them all. We instead adopted a medium new to Crimson Opinion, and gave our board members the chance to tell their own stories. From what is usually one mouthpiece, we brought forth many vignettes of the pandemic’s early days.
One year later, our board has still not reunited in-person. Below is a testament to where we’ve been in this time we’ve spent apart, with pictures to illustrate — as much to you as to each other — where this pandemic year has found us.
With traditional senior-year celebrations canceled, I didn’t want to get my hopes up. But at the very least, I could be excited for pink satin, my friend's bluetooth speaker, a corsage of front-yard flowers — the lovely bones that remained. In the end, we had everything we needed.

A family friend, Oluwatoyin Salau, went missing days after I watched her speak at a Black Lives Matter protest; the first in Tallahassee last summer. She was 19 and, as I listened, I remember filing her in my head as a role model: so smart and beautiful. During the days before her body was found, I felt incredible suffocation: Were we being hunted? They held her vigil at the state capital.

To escape the house, my mom, sister, and I went camping in the Adirondacks. After the campus eviction notice in March, I remember standing on Weeks Bridge, looking out at the Charles River, and wondering where the ducks go when the river freezes over. Or rather, where the students go when the school shuts down. I found some answers among the trees.

It was strange being in the city again after so long. I walked by the high school that I didn’t get to graduate from because my last months were spent on a computer screen. I walked by, not to clean out a locker that’s no longer mine or to pick up a diploma that can’t be sent in the mail, but just to sit here and see this.

Constructed using a pair of scissors, impatient hands, and “inspiration” gleaned from Ikea’s instruction manual, my desk was a point of pride and precarity: a makeshift desk for a makeshift school year. One erratic gesture away from collapse, with time and familiarity, its wobbly edges eventually became imperceptible to me.

After deciding a little snow wouldn’t stop me from going about my morning, I took this photo after walking from the Malkin Athletic Center to Annenberg. For the first time in my unpredictable fall semester, everything felt normal. The Yard came alive that day – everyone enjoying the first snow of the season.
—Nicole B. Alexander ’24
We took this photo after the first snowfall last semester. Every freshman from the South or California (myself included) went crazy building snowmen, since we hadn’t seen snow in years. Right after this photo, we started throwing snowballs at John Harvard, which quickly ended once I hit Dean Khurana’s window.

My first time voting in a U.S. presidential election. Roused by the high stakes of the race, my hands were shaking so much that I hardly even managed to take these pictures. But rocked by the frigid air, fueled by caffeine, and motivated by hope, I managed to capture all three … and if I were to have torn off my mask for that third photo, I would have also captured a glimmer of a prescient, winning smile.
—Gemma J. Schneider ’23
I left my dorm and headed into Boston when the election was called for Biden. Everyone was celebrating. Covid was still a looming threat and we didn’t yet know about the highly effective vaccines, but in this moment there was finally hope for a better future — and for a return to campus.
—Orlee G.S. Marini-Rapoport ’23-24
This Christmas “break” was different. Rather than a soothing return to home from school, it was a refreshing reprieve, a little more time with my loved ones. I am eternally grateful to have had my siblings, nephews, mother, and grandparents to make deliciously burnt shortbread cookies with this season.
—Sterling M. Bland ’23
Flying back to campus for my second semester, I realized that the world is both much bigger and smaller than expected. I thought about the trees and their cycles of shedding then regrowing their leaves, finding comfort in nature’s continuity. I looked forward to the spring — wanting to grow, too.

Seeing Harvard for the first time in February was astonishing, but as a foodie, collecting cuisine from surrounding restaurants was much more nourishing than the non-nutritive architecture. Delighting in Tatte’s cheesecake cups, El Jefe’s burritos, Mike’s Pastry cannolis or Dumpling House’s seafood dumplings defined the start of my Harvard experience.

More or less confined to each other’s company this semester, my roommates and I spent every waking minute together. I wouldn’t trade a single second of that precious time for anything.

Before the Zoom meeting opened and my upperclassmen House was revealed, my heart raced in my chest. Sharing the anxiety, suspense, and exhilaration of the virtual rendition of Housing Day with hundreds of freshmen made me all the more excited to eventually explore the Harvard campus and community in person.

I took this photo out the back door window of our ridiculous 17-person house in Cambridge at 5:47 a.m. after staying up the entire night with a housemate, tier-listing the top 20 most influential philosophers to avoid thinking about our feelings. I miss that house even though it ruined my sleep schedule.

I took this photo on my 19th birthday, May 3. It is my first picture of Eliot House, my soon to be home for the next four years. My mom insisted that its tower was green, but I can’t accept any descriptive word other than “jade”. It’s jade, right?

Acadia National Park's Cadillac Mountain witnesses one of the first sunrises in the continental US. We hiked up at 3:30; the dawn shattered at 5. The sky and ocean ignited golden-coral, and everyone on the summit exhaled. It’s cliché, but I think we’ve all been holding our breath for a long time.

At the intersection of Anemouku Street and Kamehameha Highway, cars glide across the dark road, a quick swoosh every few seconds. The ocean, cobalt and glassy in my peripheral vision, creates an optical illusion of solidity. In my rearview mirror, Jenny, Elyse, and Izzy are squished in the back. Alex sits beside me on the passenger side. I wonder how everyone looks so pretty at 6:15 a.m. Applying winged eyeliner at the crack of dawn is an impressive feat.
For the past few weeks, we’ve been living an hour from the more populated areas on the island of Oahu, Hawaii and about 15 miles from the surfer hubs on the North Shore. Our home base is a small town of isolated beaches, occasional food trucks, and a singular main road — any travelling beyond Foodland and a nearby mini mall is a solid trek. Because of this picturesque remoteness, Oahu is the only place where I drive more than I do back home; over the past year, during the months living in my childhood bedroom, I often found myself taking aimless drives – canyon, freeway, shortcut to nowhere – discovering and rediscovering my favorite music. It is the only place where a spontaneous two-hour drive feels less like a chore and more like a gift.
When we first drove from the Honolulu airport to our homebase in Laie, we played “Electric Dream,” which sounds pastel, and “Good Days,” which feels like glitter. Our rental car sandwiched between blue-green water and grassy mountains, my internal monologue sang, this is it this is it this is it!
Now, I fiddle with the Bluetooth to connect my Spotify. I wait for the system to ding in compliance, and I turn on my left turn signal. Hunched over the steering wheel, I’m jolted by the blaring onslaught of lyrics:
I love bad bitches that’s my fuckin’ problem and yeah I like to fuck I got a fuckin’ problem.
Rise and shine, I guess.
A wave of exasperation washes over me when I realize I’ve spent minutes at the intersection without moving. And now, the 2012 A$AP Rocky, Drake, Kendrick, and 2 Chainz collab, “F**kin’ Problems,” is roaring in our ears at maximum volume and disturbing the tranquility of our morning drive. I’m doing a terrible job at my designated gap-year role of Driver and Aux-er.
Whenever I’m running late, I’m hit with a three-cold-brews-deep kind of jitters. We’ve just rushed out of our temporary home and we’re scheduled to miss the sunrise part of a sunrise hike on the other side of the island. I didn’t even have time to queue a few songs before we left, and the idea that anything from my entire music library will play — simpy R&B to bar mitzvah-era pop tracks — provokes an unnecessary sense of dread.
The highway quiets for a few beats, and I finally turn left. At the next red light, I stop and scroll through my Spotify. Perusing my 104 playlists, I imagine myself 10 miles from now, peacefully listening to Joni Mitchell or SoundCloud-era Frank Ocean, passing the “No Development” signs and hidden beaches. I try to recreate my embodiment from that first drive to the airport — this, too, should be just as much a perfect moment. But instead, I falter: My self-induced pressure widens a gap between the contentment I should feel and the anxiety I’m actually feeling. The key to unlocking that ‘this is it’ feeling, I determine, must reside in an immaculately-curated soundtrack, the perfect playlist I have no time to create.
When the car behind me suddenly honks for 10 seconds straight, I’m jolted out of my mind. I spin my head up from my phone and see a green light. In the rearview mirror, a woman in a beige truck flips me off and speeds into the opposite lane to pass me. As she pulls up next to me, she rolls down her window.
“Pay attention, dumbass,” she yells, pointing at her temple. “Don’t You Worry ’Bout a Thing” starts playing.
A mile or so later, beige-car-woman’s offhand road rage worms her way into the insecure cortex of my brain. Am I a dumbass? Running late: dumbass behavior. Inappropriate background music: dumbass behavior. Unable to enjoy a perfect drive I should be grateful for: exceptionally dumbass behavior. I make a tally of everything I said I would do last week that I didn’t. Didn’t call Nana. Missed a Zoom panel. Didn’t finish my book. Barely worked out. I wonder if I need to do taxes this year. What is a fiscal new year? Mental to-do-list begets mental to-do-list. Anxiety begets anxiety.
I need to relax — we’ll be on Kamehameha Highway for 22 miles. I tell myself by the time we pass Papa Ole’s Kitchen, I will be the cool girl.
I steal sideways glances at the ocean. The street still glows in the diminishing moonlight. If we’re going to miss the sunrise hike, I hope for at least a little light on the stretch of highway beneath the mountains.
Driving to the cheery rhythm of Stevie Wonder, I see Jenny passed out in the middle seat and Alex sleeping on the passenger side. Izzy looks at her phone. Elyse looks out the window. We are settled into early morning silence.
We pass a fruit stand, a North Shore Tacos, a truck that sells malasadas, and, to my dismay, Papa Ole’s Kitchen. My irritability hasn’t cooled. And the most embarrassing part is that I am with my best friends on the most beautiful road in the world listening to one of my favorite songs. I am 20 years old and healthy and lucky. I am so annoyed that I am annoying, mad that I’m mad, sad that I can’t just let myself drive in peace. Why did I have to bring me to Hawaii?
“Don’t You Worry ’Bout a Thing” ends and “hand crushed by a mallet” starts playing. That’s more like it.
I make eye contact with Elyse through the rearview mirror. I know she doesn’t like this song or 100 gecs in general — an abrasive hyperpop band that elicits eye rolls from people who prefer their music to sound pleasant — but I find the awful noises oddly comforting, like slapping a mosquito bite or getting hit in the face in a good way.
As 100 gecs screeches on, I check Google Maps. From the small North Shore town of Laie to the better-known Kailua is a solid one-hour drive: 22 miles on the highway, another five on the main H1 freeway, and through a roundabout.
As I curve along Oahu’s coast, I dissect “hand crushed by a mallet”: androgynous autotune, off-beat drumming, psychologically troubling lyrics, cathartic beat drop — the kind of sound a Reddit user described as “take a bunch of colored pencils in one hand and draw on black paper.” On a morning where chaos rules my mental landscape, the discordance in the song offers a moment of respite. It meets me where I am.
A few tracks from Astroworld follow “hand crushed by a mallet.” Jenny stirs to the electric haze of R.I.P. SCREW and I hear murmurs of conversation in the backseat. Alex wakes up and plays my Hawaii playlist on Bluetooth. We start off calm with “Trouble Sleeping” and “I Say a Little Prayer,” reach medium-energy with “So Hot You’re Hurting My Feelings,” until suddenly I’m rapping the Rick Ross verse on “Money in the Grave” while thumping my shoulders against the car seat to the rhythm.
The high-volume bass reverberates in the center of my stomach and spreads through my limbs. My frenetic anger, anxiety, imposter syndrome, melodrama — whatever I decide to call it that day — hasn’t vanished, but I’m glad that my friends are awake now, the sun is rising, and I suspect I’m less of a dumbass than I thought I was moments before. Forcing away the discontent, it seems, does more harm than just vibing with it. I mentally thank 100 gecs for being an unlikely salve.
When we finally reach the mountains, “Poetic Justice” starts playing. Janet Jackson’s ethereal sampling overlays the gritty love song and unruly thoughts rest softer in my mind. I feel a warmth on my outstretched arms. The windows are down and the sunroof is open — I hadn’t even noticed.

At that moment, they were my whole world. I sat on the back porch with my head tilted upwards, sunshine flooding my eyes. Everything I needed could be found in the splotches of white wandering across the infinite blue lawn above me.
As they were travelling along in the big blue unknown, I wanted to join them. There is something captivating about the freedom of the clouds — the way in which they trust that they will somehow float wherever they need to go, if they need to be anywhere at all. They seemed so unlike me, someone always tempted to plan and prepare for the next semester of classes to take, activities to join, or careers to pursue. I liked knowing my destination because it meant I could lay out a series of steps to follow and complete.
But as I gazed up at the clouds the summer before starting college, I began to realize that my path would soon widen into an overwhelming expanse of choices and possibilities.
In high school, I’d felt a general sense of direction in terms of making room for all of my interests. After school, I ran from a magazine editing meeting to Math Team to Robotics practice. I was determined to continue doing everything in college, from science and math to creative writing and poetry. But come freshman fall, I was swept up in a whirlwind of STEM classes and extracurriculars; I ended up placing the humanities on the back burner. Eventually, after a year-long hiatus, I found myself missing reading literature and writing papers, and I made it a point to incorporate analytical and creative writing into my courses and extracurriculars. Now, having taken philosophy and religion classes, I feel as though I have made my way back to these ideas I remember having been so passionate about.
Despite how much I have enjoyed rediscovering my interest in the humanities, it still feels like I’m drifting in a sea of even more possibilities and unknowns. Sometimes I think I should just pick a well-defined path, like medical or graduate school, where the road ahead has already been paved with signs and intersections. I’m taking the full course of medical school prerequisite classes, just in case.
At times I also find myself with a desire to get lost somewhere along the way, to leap into something new. This longing manifests as a restlessness that I have tried to settle by trying a variety of extracurriculars.
Every semester of college so far, I have joined a new club. First Women in Computer Science, then the Harvard International Review, and now The Harvard Crimson — my interests have expanded far beyond the scope of what I originally thought they would be in freshman fall. Maybe it’s a mid-college crisis or my longing for adventure, but I find myself wondering if my interests are too disconnected from one another, if I am becoming too much of a “jack of all trades, master of none.” I start to question my motives — am I doing what other people think I should be doing, or am I doing what I truly enjoy? With each new activity I become involved in, I constantly overanalyze why I make the decisions I do.
I’m almost an upperclassman now, but I feel like my college journey is just getting started. I still want to try new things and explore further. Although my broad range of interests may not converge the way I expect it to, I remain optimistic that these doubts will settle and I will figure out my way, or it will figure itself out.
Until then, I try to remain inspired by the clouds wandering around in the sky. They make it seem easy, floating along seemingly unconcerned with their eventual destination. As they drift on their own search for where they are supposed to be, maybe the clouds can help me figure out where I am supposed to be, too.

My first interview with Olivia M. Price ’21 is on a Saturday morning in late March. She’s two months away from a virtual graduation that feels like a “deflated balloon,” but she wonders whether that’s entirely a bad thing. “I would say the senior class as a whole has maybe come together, because this will always be something we share,” Price says, “having our senior year not how we imagined it.”
I expected the first part of her answer. The point of the article was to chronicle a senior blocking group’s spoiled final year at Harvard. But what I found in my reporting was slightly more complicated.
I call all the girls on a Friday afternoon in early April. For a moment it’s just me on the Zoom, until another box pops up and I see five figures squashed together on a single window. Price is on the left, dressed in business casual for an interview she has later that day. Nellie F. Ide ’21-22 and Sophie M. Sun ’21 perch on top of a sofa with Julia R. Friedman ’21 between them. To their right, Ciara E. Duggan ’21 smiles in a sweatshirt that spells out “MATHER” in the Friends font.
By this point, I’ve already interviewed all of the girls separately, but it’s different to see them together. They’ve each spoken about how living off-campus during their senior year has made them closer, but I don’t realize how close until I witness them shoulder-to-shoulder, completely at ease with one another.
“Sophie and I were freshman year roommates in Wigg,” Duggan begins. “We ended up blocking with a group of people that included Julia and Nellie.” The group was placed in Mather House, where they met Price and lived until March of last year. When Harvard announced that most students would be remote for the fall semester, the girls scrambled to find off-campus housing in Cambridge.
“Before I even knew I wanted to take classes, I knew I wanted to be in Cambridge,” Friedman says. “Pretty quickly we realized that a lot of us wanted to be here, so we started looking for houses.” The group found a rental in Central Square 10 minutes from campus, and they’ve lived there since September. Despite the disappointment of a senior year away from Harvard, Price, Ide, Sun, Friedman, and Duggan admit that the experience has been surprisingly positive.
“During the pandemic, you can’t go anywhere. There’s no club activities to go to, no athletic events, no going to class, or to hang out in the dining hall or the library. We were all in our kitchen, or in our living room together, most of the day, every day,” Duggan reflects. “I think inevitably, we got a lot closer through that. I definitely think we have unbreakable bonds after this experience.” She glances back at her roommates and they share a laugh.
“Basically, we’ve been trying to recreate the main events of the year in a Covid-safe way,” Ide adds. The girls launch into the past year’s lineup: a makeshift Harvard-Yale game in their backyard, pumpkin carving, an outdoor “formal” at a rooftop bar, a night when they wore brightly colored wigs in public.
By the end of the group interview, I’ve spent a lot of time smiling and laughing. I’m impressed by the girls’ optimistic outlook. But I have to remember back to our first individual interviews in March, and I realize that for all of the fun they’ve shared, the girls have still struggled to accept some aspects of this unprecedented year.
Olivia, who lost her senior season of water polo, reflects, “I started getting a little nostalgic and sad that I would never be able to play for the Harvard Crimson again.” When I ask her if she ever considered taking time off to retain her athletic eligibility, she flashes a pained smile and says, “my love for water polo is not enough to put my whole life on hold for a year. I’m kind of ready to continue on with my life and graduate with the friends I’ve made here.”
Academics raised additional challenges. Aside from “Zoom fatigue” in classes, Duggan, who was one of three roommates to write a senior thesis, admits, “the whole process was a little bit more challenging being remote.” She points out that in normal years, seniors typically spend January writing their theses together, adding, “It did feel very isolating to come back to my Cambridge house and be alone writing on a computer with no one around.”
Although the girls were only a few miles from campus (and still managed to see many of their classmates and friends regularly), several noted a distinct shift in their sense of connection to the college. “I don’t feel as connected to Harvard,” Friedman remarks. “It’s been an awesome year living with friends, not an awesome year going to Harvard. I think a lot of what makes Harvard so special is the housing system and the dining halls and walking through the Yard, and now [we] don’t have any of that.”
Despite many setbacks, the girls maintain that they are enjoying their senior semester. Sun, in particular, insists that the past year has been one of the best of her life.
“I’ve just realized that you can make the best out of any situation if you’re with friends,” she says. “I took a class taught by [Professor] Ellen Langer, about positive psychology. Something I’ve taken away from that class is that whenever something happens that you don’t like, or that makes you sad,” she continues, “just think to yourself, ‘Is it a tragedy or an inconvenience?’ 99 percent of the time, it’s an inconvenience, and I’ve carried that phrase with me.”
I had expected them to feel completely cheated out of a fun and memorable senior year. Maybe it was my own baggage, that I’d come to Harvard as a nervous first-year and been sent home just as I began to find my footing. In my limited college experience, had I assumed that a physical campus was the most important factor in feeling part of a community?
Eventually, I decide to ask about the interview process itself: What did it feel like to reflect on this past year, and were there any surprises in what came out?
Price, who had not lived with the other girls in years prior, answers, “I knew I was going to tell you that this was an amazing experience, but I didn’t expect to dive so deeply into the fact that they had all lived together before, [yet] they never made me feel like I wasn’t part of their group. Now, these are the people that are going to be some of my best friends five years from now when I talk about my college friends.”
Sun echoes a similarly positive outlook on the year, but she adds that she has already spent a good amount of time reflecting with her friends and classmates. “There’s always that question when you catch up with people, like, ‘How’s your year been during Covid?’ and ‘Oh, I’m sorry this has been your senior year.’ But I’m like, no, no, don’t be sorry, this has literally been one of the best years of my life. So I think I’ve already done that reflection.”
Given everything they know now, what advice would the girls have given themselves a year ago?
“I would just tell myself that things will work out and be fine, just to stress less,” Duggan offers.
Ide, who is the only roommate taking the year off, agrees. “Last March, when we realized we wouldn’t be coming back to campus, I was like, ‘Why did I choose so many times to study an extra hour rather than doing some fun adventure with friends?’” She notes, “I think this has just given me a little more perspective to understand how I can maximize my remaining year in college.”
Price would tell herself to be grateful for the experiences she’s had at Harvard, but also to “be ready to move on and turn to another chapter.”
“I have an all-in attitude about everything that’s gonna go on in the next month,” Friedman states. “Whenever anyone mentions doing anything, I kind of just want to say yes, like if it’s going to play volleyball on the river” or heading to “an all-you-can-eat sushi lunch.” She says, “I’m realizing that it’s my last chance to do a lot of things around campus and be around a lot of people, and that if I don’t take advantage of that now, I’ll miss my opportunity forever.”
But something tells me that Friedman won’t miss that opportunity. I don’t think any of the girls will, because in the past month I’ve gotten to know them, they’ve taught me a lot about what it means to make the best of a seemingly unfortunate situation. I had naively imagined that all seniors would mourn a year “lost,” but as Sun puts it, her Harvard experience is “this group of people.” Olivia, Nellie, Sophie, Julia, and Ciara. A group of people that she can hold onto for much longer than four years.

November 12, 2019 was a Tuesday. It was chilly in Somerville; later that evening it would snow lightly as a storm moved in from the north. Sean Roberson began his morning by walking his six-year-old son to the Albert F. Argenziano School, one of Somerville’s public elementary schools, where he was enrolled as a first-grader.
To protect his privacy, Roberson and his wife, Flavia C. Peréa, a Sociology lecturer at Harvard, publicly refer to their son only by the initial ‘J’. In one of the few pictures they’ve posted of him online, he has a head of curly black hair and smooth brown skin; he’s turned his face from the camera to focus on digging into the soil with a small gardening fork. Roberson describes him as playful and warm. “He’s into Transformers and Pokémon cards and Beyblades,” he says. “Sometimes he’ll come up to you and want a big hug … You know, just a normal kid.”
Roberson left J at the Argenziano School that morning without much thought. J liked first grade — his color-coded daily behavior chart from that month was mostly shaded in green, meaning he had been having pretty good days.
Peréa, meanwhile, had headed to work. A few hours later, around noon, she received a call at her desk from Argenziano’s Dean of Students, Karen Grenier-Mernin. J had touched another student on her “private parts,” the dean said. The incident wasn’t observed by a teacher, and the details Grenier-Mernin relayed to Peréa were vague, but the school was treating it as sexual harassment — as such, they’d have to report it to the state of Massachusetts.
Peréa was stunned. On a website titled “Architecture of Injustice” where she’s recorded most of the chronological information around this event, she says that when she asked for the school’s definition of sexual harassment — or how a six-year-old would ever be able to fulfill such a definition — Grenier-Mernin seemed to be unable to find it. The school still hasn’t provided Peréa with a definition, she says. When Peréa pressed Grenier-Mernin further, she says Grenier-Mernin told her that “this is what [the school] told me to do.”
She immediately called Roberson; he needed to pick J up. It wasn’t safe, she thought. Two hours later, she received a voicemail from the police, which she recorded. “Hi, this message is for Flavia,” it begins. “This is Detective Natacha Montina-Garcia from Somerville Police calling you and letting you know that I did receive a call from your son’s school today… When you get this message, give me a call back.” The call contained no further details.
Peréa became frantic. “I was out of my mind,” she says. The school hadn’t given her any more information about the allegations against her son — they hadn’t even told her that they’d called the police, in apparent violation of the district’s usual procedures — though the Somerville Department of Health and Human Services told her that school officials had probably contacted the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families (DCF) as well. For two days, she thought that the DCF or the police might show up at her door; she was particularly worried that the latter might put Roberson, who is Black, at risk.
She began desperately trying to find a lawyer. But not only was J far younger than most attorneys’ clients; he was so young that he couldn’t even be charged with a crime in Massachusetts. Someone who dealt exclusively with criminal law couldn’t assist her.
On Tuesday night, running out of options, she called the WilmerHale Legal Services Center at Harvard Law School. “I was hysterically crying,” she says. “They called the police on my six-year-old.”
Peréa adds, “You think that you have such high capacity and that you understand things but then you run up against this situation and you’re like, ‘Crap, I need someone to help me. And I can’t find anybody to help me.’”
***
Eventually, Roberson and Peréa would learn the following: Though the Dean of Students told Peréa that the school was treating J’s case as an instance of sexual harassment, that day, school administrators filed two 51As — a form filled out in Massachusetts in cases of suspected child abuse or neglect — with the DCF accusing J of sexual abuse (defined by the state as “Engaging in a non-accidental sexual act(s) with a child that causes harm or substantial risk of harm to the child’s health or welfare”). They had also filed a report with the Somerville Police accusing him of indecent assault and battery (defined as the “indecent” and “intentional touching of another person, without legal justification or excuse”) according to Peréa. Though he couldn’t be charged, J’s personal information was entered into two state databases associating him with different forms of sexual assault, all before he had finished first grade.
What exactly happened between J and his classmate is still unknown, since no one else witnessed it. Still, accounts from the teacher and the classmate, as well as the school’s internal treatment of the incident, don’t match an allegation of sexual harassment, let alone sexual assault. J’s teacher later told Peréa that the classmate told her that J had “touched [the classmate’s] bum.” This differed slightly from what the Dean of Students had told Peréa — that J had touched the classmate’s “private parts.”
The classmate’s family felt that disciplinary action against J was unnecessary, and the two children continued playing together upon J’s return to school. Curiously, even after filing a report with both the DCF and Somerville Police, the school also refrained from punishing J, and while J’s teacher reported the incident to a superior, she didn’t take any direct action against him. Peréa says that in a later meeting, the school’s principal, Glenda Soto, told her that J had done “nothing wrong.”
If J’s teacher’s account is taken as fact, J almost certainly did not do anything wrong by the Somerville Public Schools’s own definition of sexual harassment (which the Dean of Students failed to provide for Peréa, but is searchable online), which states that “Unwelcome sexual advances; requests for sexual favors; or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature may constitute sexual harassment where, A. Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a condition of a person’s employment or educational development, B. Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment or education decisions affecting such individual, or C. Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working or educational environment.” It is dubious that J’s behavior fits any of these clauses.
There’s also the question of whether a six-year-old can even have the intent necessary to sexually harass or assault anyone — since children younger than twelve can’t be charged with a crime in Massachusetts, lawmakers seem to have decided that they do not. J’s behavior as described by his teacher also appears to be developmentally normal. In a 2009 report on sexual behaviors in children from the American Academy of Pediatrics, researchers wrote that “Most situations that involve sexual behaviors in young children do not require child protective services intervention.”
In a November 21 meeting, the school’s attorney told Roberson and Peréa that the administration’s actions were justified according to the mandated reporter training provided to teachers by the Middlesex Children’s Advocacy Center; per state law, teachers are mandated reporters, meaning that they are required to report sexual abuse. Similarly, when asked to comment for this article, the Somerville Public Schools provided an emailed statement that stipulated that while they couldn’t comment on the specifics of this case: “It is important to understand our obligations as mandated reporters.” The district’s statement explains that, “Mandated reporting is not discretionary. Reporting is conducted without bias, keeping the safety of each and every student at the forefront.”
The mandated reporter training is publicly available online. In an apparent contradiction to claims from the attorney and the school district, the training specifies that, “Sexual curiosity and behaviors that are developmentally appropriate for children six years old or younger do not qualify as sexual abuse.” It continues, “Age-appropriate sexualized behaviors in young children are transient and often only require adult guidance and redirection.” Essentially, these behaviors should not be reported.
And yet, the school administrators did treat the situation as a case of sexual abuse when they filed the 51As. Both forms were screened out — deemed unworthy of investigation —  within hours of their being reported. The school also filed a police report. The choice to report the incident as a sexual assault seems to have been made by administrators; Detective Montina-Garcia eventually told Peréa that she was called by either the principal or the director of student services, though she wouldn’t specify which.
Roberson and Peréa are currently seeking an apology from the school and the removal of J’s information from state databases. For a year-and-a-half, they’ve been mystified by what they see as the school administration’s drive to ascribe criminal intent to a six-year-old. Still, it’s not lost on them that J is Black, Latino, and male, and his classmate is white and female. Peréa notes that each report that the school filed “became increasingly more criminal in the language that was used. And every time that happens, it moves further away from being about a child.”
“I think the literature very clearly supports, and all the literature around school-to-prison pipeline, in particular, that school personnel view Black and brown children differently,” she says. “[They] pathologize developmentally appropriate behavior, [which leads to] the criminalization of Black and brown bodies.”
Roberson echoes that sentiment. “On that day, they didn’t see a six-year-old, they didn’t see a child,” he says. “They saw a criminal.”
***
What happened to J is, by all accounts, highly unusual. But if anything, it’s an extreme manifestation of a racist system that typically works in a far more pernicious manner. As Peréa points out on her website, though the student body of Somerville Public Schools is 9 percent Black and 41 percent Latinx, these students make up 74 percent of students disciplined. According to data from the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, Black and Latinx students make up about 30 percent of the students in Massachusetts, but over 50 percent of the students disciplined across the state.
In the United States as a whole, Black students are far more likely to be punished than white students. A 2019 study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America stated that, “Using federal data covering over 32 million students at nearly 96,000 schools, our research demonstrates that the disciplinary gap between black and white students across five types of disciplinary actions is associated with county-level rates of racial bias.”
In studies of school discipline, researchers have found that Black students are more likely to be punished than white students even when controlling for other factors — for example, Black students are four times more likely than white students to be suspended for the same behavior. In a 2016 study from the Yale Child Study Center, researchers tracked the eye movements of teachers in classrooms. Over and over again, they observed a disturbing phenomenon: more than any other group, teachers watch Black boys.
Sometimes, as in J’s case, disciplinary action escalates to police involvement. Many schools in the United States have an agreement with their local police departments called a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), which outlines situations in which schools will involve police. Proponents of MOUs argue that they make schools safer. Critics say that they often increase police involvement in schools. In 2019, Somerville’s MOU included a clause in which the school was required to contact the police in cases of alleged sexual assault — which, the school says, is why they called police about J.
J was too young to actually be arrested in Massachusetts. But had he lived in a different state, or if he were born a few years earlier, he could have been handcuffed and taken to a police station. Young children aren’t usually the subjects of arrest, but there are exceptions. A quick search yields several recent examples — in one, from March 2021, a five-year-old boy in Maryland was handcuffed for throwing a basketball at a teacher. In another, an 8-year-old in Florida was arrested for hitting a teacher. Video of the latter incident shows a police officer telling the child, “You know where you’re going? You’re going to jail.”
Still, focusing entirely on elementary-age students may obscure a larger picture. Interactions between students and police in schools become more likely as children grow older. If J were in middle or high school, he may have been put in contact with a school resource officer (SRO) — a police officer stationed inside a school building. Schools across the country have SROs, ostensibly for school safety. A 2020 evaluation of schools with such positions found that SROs do not make schools safer, though they did increase the number of disciplinary actions taken against students. Following the Sandy Hook shooting, Massachusetts passed a law mandating that all schools have SROs, unless they petitioned not to have them. Data indicate that their presence significantly increased the number of school-based arrests. Despite making up only 27 percent of all Massachusetts students, Black and Latinx students accounted for 64 percent of these arrests during the 2015-2016 school year.
The law requiring SROs has since been repealed, and in May of 2021 Somerville schools placed a moratorium on two programs that put police officers in schools within the city, including SROs. The moratorium comes after months of organizing and protest in response to J’s situation, although Andre Green, a member of the city’s School Committee, told the Boston Globe the committee had planned to consider the issue regardless.
Even if students don’t directly interact with police in schools, what happens there may still propel them into the criminal justice system later on. Many forms of punishment in schools — detentions and suspensions, for example — are referred to by experts, such as the American Psychological Association, as “exclusionary discipline”: disciplinary action that “removes or excludes a student from his or her usual educational setting.”
Such punishment is predicated on the belief that such children deserve to be excluded for their “bad” behavior — similar to the belief that those who commit crimes deserve incarceration. Still, it’s worth noting that two-thirds of suspensions in Massachusetts are for non-violent, non-drug-related incidents. Some might also argue that children learn from this kind of punishment — in reality, studies show that once a child has been disciplined this way once, they are more likely to be disciplined again.
Leon Smith, the executive director of the Massachusetts nonprofit Citizens for Juvenile Justice, says that the real effect of exclusionary discipline is that kids “aren’t in school to learn.” When discipline starts with younger children, the effects multiply. Smith adds, “We’ve known from research that students who are behind grade level in reading by the end of third grade have a hard time ever catching up and become more likely to drop out.”
Smith says that instead of using positive reinforcement tactics, exclusionary discipline leads children to lose fundamental building blocks in their education and puts them back into potentially unstable environments. This may be part of the reason why 60 percent of U.S. prisoners are functionally illiterate — as children, they were kept out of schools and shuttled into the carceral system instead.
Sometimes, Roberson and Peréa think about what could have happened to J had they, educated professionals, not been his parents. If his parents hadn’t had the time or resources to speak out about his case and pursue legal action, one imagines that he could have easily fallen into the system described by Smith.
“I’m fortunate in that I’m not afraid of the police,” Peréa says. “I’m not afraid of ICE. I will articulate what I feel needs to be said. I’m good at doing the detective work… I wasn’t afraid to go to the media, because it’s like, if you treat me like this, what the hell else are they doing to other families?”
***
After the incident, Peréa and Roberson kept J home for two weeks; they consulted his pediatrician and decided to remove him from the school environment for his own safety. They carefully probed him about what had happened with his classmate and explained the importance of keeping his hands to himself. Otherwise, they gave him as little detail as possible. Even if J could have fully understood what was happening, they thought that further explanations could have been traumatizing. “We want [him] to be a normal kid like anybody else,” Roberson says.
At home, Roberson undertook deliberate efforts to distract J. He made sure that J kept up with his school work and taught him math and reading. They spent days at the Boston Children’s Museum and the Museum of Science. Sometimes they visited the Boston Aquarium, which J particularly enjoyed; he likes learning about animals. On other days, they’d just go to the playground. Occasionally, despite his father’s best efforts, J would start crying — he missed his friends, and he missed school. He didn’t understand why he couldn’t go back.
Peréa and Roberson never expected that anything like this would happen to their son. When they moved to the Boston area from New York City, they selected Somerville for its diversity and professed progressive values. They felt comfortable in the community; they were excited to raise their children here.
They weren’t completely naive about the possibility that their son might be treated unfairly. “As a person of color, or, more specifically, a Black man, that’s always in the back of your head, right?” Roberson says. “I mean, we’re in America. Some places are a little more progressive than others. But it doesn’t matter what city you’re in, and how progressive you think they are, there’s always something. You’re going to experience something somewhere.”
Still, they were completely unprepared for this. “To really run up against obstacle after obstacle after obstacle at the local level, at the state level has just been spectacular, I don’t know how to put it,” Peréa says. “It’s been something to actually see [the reality of] when we talk about systemic injustice.”
Peréa and Roberson have fought for a year-and-a-half to get J’s information out of the DCF, Somerville Police, and the Middlesex District Attorney’s Office databases. They still haven’t made much progress; they recently started a GoFundMe to cover their legal expenses.
In June, amid a resurgence of the Black Lives Matter Movement, they watched as Somerville hung a Black Lives Matter banner above City Hall. As Peréa notes on her website, Somerville Mayor Joseph A. Curtanoe also issued a declaration of a local state of emergency, declaring “systemic racism to be a public safety and public health emergency.” Despite her calls for action, Curtanoe has never publicly said anything about J’s case.
That same month, in an email to the school community, Soto, the principal, wrote, “We need [to] take a moment to reflect and stand together to fight systemic racism and give our young men and women of color a chance to navigate this world with the same rights.”
J had been observing all this, too. Though his parents hadn’t told him the full extent of his own situation, they didn’t prevent him from learning about the protests last June and July. To keep it from him, they thought, would be doing him a disservice — he wouldn’t understand how to keep himself safe. “We talk about this a lot,” Peréa says. “We talked about how the rules are different. We talk about how that’s not fair. But we talk about how it’s true.”
Still, that level of understanding had consequences. In February, Peréa and Roberson went on Good Morning America to talk about their story. On the day that their segment aired, they tried to fully explain to J what had happened for the first time; if they didn’t tell him themselves, they thought, somebody else would. Initially, J seemed calm. But when they turned on the TV, he couldn’t make it through.
“He fell apart,” Peréa says. “I mean, he went upstairs and he stayed in the bed, and he was crying all morning. And he literally wrote on a paper because he couldn’t talk, he couldn’t verbalize what he was thinking. He eventually came around, grabbed a piece of paper and wrote, ‘I’m going to jail.’”
Watching him, she was trying to keep herself from crying, too.

Warning: This piece contains explicit description and discussion of sexual activity, as well as language some may consider offensive or violent.
Asa Akira was 25 when she discovered one of her “favorite things in the world”: double penetration. She had just landed her first showcase — a relic of the DVD era of porn — and was starring in a movie of five or six scenes. On her first day of shooting, she was slated to have vaginal sex in a threesome with two guys. What she didn’t know was that her life would be changed forever.
“The chemistry was right, everything was perfect,” Akira says. “I was so turned on. And I just ended up doing double penetration.”
Before filming, she hadn’t really thought about trying double penetration, and if not for this scene, she “would have been a totally different kind of performer today.” Simply put, this was both a turning point in her career and a revelatory moment in her life. She remembers thinking, “Oh shit, I better go into everything I do with an ‘anything can happen’ attitude.” The idea that there were still new and amazing experiences yet to be unlocked at 25 years old was exhilarating. Now, she says, “The sky’s the limit.”
Because of her showcase, “Asa Akira is Insatiable,” Akira went from being a token Asian performer to a rising pornstar in her own right — specifically known for her anal sex scenes. She’s won the Adult Video News Female Performer of the Year Award — the pornstar equivalent of the Academy Award for Best Actress — and was the inaugural host of the Pornhub Awards. She’s one of the most recognizable names in porn, often referred to as “the anal queen.”
At 35 years old, with 16 years of sex work experience under her belt, Akira says she would still do porn even if she won the lottery. She really just loves her job. “I'm a true exhibitionist. I get off on knowing that people are watching me and are getting off on me and are being turned on by me. I guess you could almost even say that's the fetish,” she says. “I really see my porn career as kind of extension of my sex life. As well as it being, you know, work.”
As the host of the Pornhub podcast, Akira hopes to disrupt the narrative that women in porn are exclusively the victims of horrible situations. She acknowledges that while this is a reality for many, sex workers are not a monolith. “A lot of us are very empowered by porn, and a lot of us are in porn not because we couldn't do anything else, but because that was our number one choice,” she says.
The porn industry’s obsession with race complicates this sense of empowerment. Between subgenres like ‘ebony’ and ‘hentai,’ terminology like ‘Big Black Cock,’ and videos that show Asian women playing massage therapists, it’s almost impossible for porn actors of color to create content that doesn’t fixate on race. Asian women, specifically, are asked to play into stereotypes of submissiveness and exoticism, as well as caricatures of Asian culture. Akira sums up the nature of the fetishization of Asian women with a joke that a white guy told her in high school: “Fucking an Asian girl is like camping out in your own backyard, because it's just exotic enough, but you're still close to home.”
When she started out in porn, Akira landed roles that often epitomized these racialized images — and at the time, they didn’t bother her. “If you had asked me five years ago, I would have said, ‘I have zero problem being fetishized. I see it as a celebration.’ I didn't know what the problem was,” she says. “Now, I feel a little bit differently. Now, I don't know.”
For a woman of color chasing her dreams of porn stardom, scenes that centered on Akira’s Asian-ness were her only options. Within a few years, she was making a living performing in roles that were “very stereotypically Asian,” such as acting as a masseuse and leaning into the trope of the docile Asian woman. Some of Akira’s Pornhub and XVideos titles include “Huge Black Cock Splits Tight Asian Ass of Asa Akira” and “Asian Masseuse Asa Akira Gives Handjob in Shower.” The naming process of these videos is a contentious subject for many porn actors of color because they have no say in the words used to market their bodies. For instance, XVideos termed one of Akira’s videos “Oriental Sluts Bring A Stud In For A Wild Threesome” without her input, even though she signed on for a standard threesome scene.
It goes without saying that these titles are obscenely racist. Moreover, they clearly don’t exist in a vacuum, but epitomize pervasive stereotypes about how racialized bodies engage in sex. These dangerous ideas percolate throughout mundane spaces far less taboo than porn — dating apps, entertainment, and college hookup cultures that render phrases like ‘yellow fever’ and ‘jungle fever’ commonplace. At the same time, these ever-present but implicit stereotypes are rarely articulated as explicitly as they are in porn. Porn appears to only magnify sexualized racism.
Whether porn reflects existing racial stereotypes or creates a monster of its own is a classic chicken-or-the-egg question. Porn and racism, most likely, engender a mutually reinforcing cycle. But Akira’s individual responsibility within this cycle is, at most, ambiguous. While theoretical questions are ripe for intellectual meanderings — like the ones in this article — it’s worth considering whether porn actors of color themselves should have to perform the labor of answering them. Over almost two decades, Akira’s beliefs on porn’s relationship to race have evolved. She has decades of evolution left to go. When asked how she contends with the far-reaching and potentially damaging impact of her career, she hesitates.
“I don't think I'm at a place right now where I'm at the final destination of my thoughts on that. I just started thinking about it,” she says. “And my thoughts aren't composed yet, if that makes sense. I'm starting to question it. And I don't have an answer.”
From the beginning of her career to the present, Akira’s professional goal has been to only do work that makes her feel sexy. Perhaps counterintuitively — especially to those who consider racial fetishization to be offensive or even violent — being fetishized didn’t always undermine this standard. To Akira, fetishization isn’t necessarily different from how we often limit our perceptions of strangers and acquaintances to the roles in which they serve us: our Amazon delivery guy is just our Amazon delivery guy, our doctor is just our doctor. And maybe to millions of PornHub and XVideos viewers, Akira is just the Asian girl they jack off to. For those five minutes, Akira says, “I don't expect them to care about anything outside of me, except for what? The parts of me that they want to masturbate to.”
“If anything, I can kind of spin it in my head in a way where I'm like, ‘Oh, I feel more celebrated, and I feel sexy because of the fact that this is fetishized.’” While this is Akira’s approach to her occupation, it doesn’t extend to the personal relationships she cherishes. “I don't want to be fetishized in my real life by my friends, by my actual lovers,” she says. “That would feel really disgusting.”
When it does come to work, the decision to “spin” instances of obvious racial stereotyping into a source of personal pleasure could be a legitimate means of reclaiming power or, more pessimistically, a kind of coping mechanism. Regardless, this is how Akira gets her bag. She’s capitalizing on the racial dynamics that, as an Asian woman simply existing in this world, would probably be imposed on her anyway.
But on a more actionable level, there are concrete ways for pornstars of color to assert their agency. According to Akira, all porn actors typically abide by their individual ‘no’ list: people they won’t work with and things they won’t do. For porn actors of color, the ‘no’ list may include certain race-related acts that they’re not comfortable with. Akira, for example, refuses to speak in an amorphous Asian accent or “clearly just make fun of Asian people.” Even though she describes ‘no’ lists as common practice within the porn industry, she points out that their volume may depend on actors’ relative degrees of privilege. Most productions include a token Asian woman, says Akira, whereas Black women may not be afforded even that. Given a scarcity of job opportunities, people may understandably compromise their ideal ‘no’ list for a paycheck.
More broadly, Akira takes issue with the lack of diversity among producers and upper-level management in porn. White men overwhelmingly profit off racist sexualized representations of people of color. Consumers also have a responsibility to make their porn consumption more ethical. Between OnlyFans, independent production companies helmed by people of color, and content on mainstream sites posted directly by the actors, there are tangible means of maximizing cash flow to sex workers of color. Akira herself has transitioned away from studio porn to serving as her own producer for exclusively solo videos.
While practices like ‘no’ lists and consumer consciousness are necessary given how the porn industry currently operates, these alone will not revolutionize how sex and race violently intersect in the popular imagination. A look at Pornhub’s content categories is evidence enough.
“In a perfect world, we wouldn't be marketed as Black this, Asian that, Latino that,” Akira says. In a perfect world, the work of porn actors of color could finally transcend racial categories. “It would just be like, ‘Oh, look at this beautiful woman. Look at this hot dude or whatever.”

The past year has been one of tumult, filled with determination and false starts; redoubled efforts and hesitation; tear- and joy- filled phone and Zoom calls filling the physical and emotional gaps of this pandemic — often many hours longer than would otherwise be necessary, but never long enough; shattering loss, and grief, and outrage at the violence so many are subjected to every day, the virus stripping bare inequities from police brutality to economic precarity to plain neglect; and, in the face of that subjugation, magical moments of outrage and movement and love.
So for our final issue, we have selected the theme “falter” — and everything the term carries with it:
To dream, and plan, and set out.
To stop, be blocked, or get lost along the way.
To lose or abandon hope; and recognizing that which is false.
Leaning and providing support.
Reflection: A change in directions, perhaps a circling back.
And, when and if possible, to recover.
Or, if preferable, to reimagine.

In Episode 1 of Under Review, hosts Matteo Wong and Olivia Oldham explore an incident of police violence against a Black undergraduate from April 2018, the resulting review committee, and its reverberations to the present day. Listen and subscribe on Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts.
MNW: Before we get started, just a heads up that this episode contains descriptions and discussion of police violence against Black individuals.
Hilda M. Jordan: We're the Chosen Few that allegedly have made it and you know, are the golden ones, quote unquote, by Harvard's own reputation, and not even that can save us while walking home
Drew G. Faust: Harvard is likely the most diverse environment in which most of our students have ever lived
Daryl G. Smith: Too many reports will say things like we urge deans and department chairs. We are long past the urging.
Cornell Brooks: You have 18,000 police departments, of which Harvard is but one.
MNW: I'm standing on a strip of sidewalk in the middle of Massachusetts Avenue, buses and cars zipping past me. To my left is Cambridge Common, to my right is the Harvard Law School campus. A couple 100 feet behind me is Pound Hall, a law school building, got a dark brick facade that in normal times has a university health clinic for law school students. This is almost exactly the spot where about three years ago, just after 9pm, Cambridge Police Department officers attacked and arrested a Black male undergraduate student at Harvard College.
MNW: A warning that what follows is audio from a recording a bystander made of the arrest. It can be difficult to listen to, if you’d prefer not to you can skip ahead 30 seconds.
Arrest audio
Hilda M. Jordan at protest: Black lives matter at Harvard, too.
MNW: I’m Matteo Wong,
OGO: And I’m Olivia Oldham. You’re listening to Under Review, a podcast from The Crimson’s weekly magazine, Fifteen Minutes, in which we’re exploring the way Harvard most often seems to deal with race, racism, and policing — a performance review.
MNW + OGO: Performance reviews are how Harvard deals with inclusion and exclusion with regards to race, but also more broadly. Here’s an abridged, brief list of some recent reviews: “the College Working Group on Diversity and Inclusion”, “The Harvard University Review Committee”, “The Presidential Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging”, “the interfaculty initiative on identity, politics, and culture”, “the interfaculty initiative on higher education, inclusion and belonging, and organizational change”, “the inclusion and belonging pulse survey”, “the AAU campus climate survey on sexual assault”, “the task force on managing student mental health”, “Initiative on Harvard and the Legacy of Slavery”, “The Task Force on Visual Culture and Signage”, “the committee to articulate principles on renaming”, “The University Discrimination and Bullying Policy Steering Committee and Working Groups”, “External Review Committee to Review Sexual Harassment at Harvard University”, “University-wide steering committee on human remains in the University’s museum collections” — sorry, that was not so brief.
OGO: These kinds of reviews can be found as early as 1980. Reading them it sometimes seems like not much has changed, in either the problems at Harvard or the University’s attempts to study them. What role have such diversity reviews played in changing the University — or, conversely, in keeping it the same?
MNW: We started thinking about these questions this summer, when on June 2, Harvard University Police Department officers were seen assisting Boston police officers at a Black Lives Matter rally in Dorchester, many miles from Harvard’s campus.
Abolish HUPD protest, june 2020: Even closer to home, we know about the Harvard police being called in as reinforcements to intimidate protestors in Boston who filled the streets to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade, and George Floyd.”
MNW: There was an outpour of anger and protest at Harvard’s involvement, heightened by how the Movement for Black Lives was erupting across the nation in response to police violence.
MNW: Within days of June 2, University President Lawrence S. Bacow sent a letter to the Harvard community, writing that HUPD presence at the BLM protest raised troubling questions about policing at Harvard. He appointed an external consulting group, 21 CP solutions, to review and provide recommendations to improve policing and public safety on campus. The final report, released in December 2020, proposes some significant changes, and Harvard is in the early stages of considering them. Yet to us, the anger and protests at Harvard police — and the University’s subsequent response, to launch a review committee — felt strangely familiar.
OGO: We almost immediately thought about the events and aftermath of April 13, 2018 — when a Harvard student asked the University Health Services to respond to their friend’s medical emergency, but instead of University medical personnel or police arriving to the scene, it was Cambridge police who responded, physically beat, and arrested the student. Why couldn’t the University help a distressed student a few dozen feet off of Harvard property in 2018, but Harvard police officers could help Boston police at a Black Lives Matter rally many miles from campus?
Emanuel: People were rightfully kind of angry at the university, for allowing this to happen as a student, and so why was the student being brutalized by the Cambridge police department?
MNW: Shortly after the events of April 13, 2018, following an outpouring of student protests, then University President Drew Faust also convened a review committee to examine what went wrong that night and make recommendations for improving HUPD, University Health services, and Harvard resources more broadly. Two years later, as BLM protests swept the country, it seemed to us like our campus was asking similar questions: is policing in its current form the best way to provide community safety? Students’ questions, however, had grown sharper alongside the evolving national tenor around policing and racism:
Abolish HUPD protest June 2020: Why does an institution that claims to embra ce dialogue and debate need a private army with untold rounds of live ammunition?
OGO: We asked why, two years after one review of racism and policing at Harvard, does it seem so little has changed, to the point that Harvard had to launch another review of racism and policing? And why are the findings and recommendations from 2018 and 2020 so similar? In this first episode we’re rewinding, from summer 2020 to spring 2018, to do our own review: An exploration of the night of April 13, 2018 and its aftermath — events and consequences that reverberate to the present.
Segment 1
OGO: April 13, 2018 was the day of Yardfest, an annual music festival at the college typically headlined by a pop musician most students don’t really care about, and a time when students get up to typical music festival antics, drinking and dancing with their friends.
OGO: April 13 was also less than three weeks after the University published the final report of the Presidential Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging, a 16-month effort involving dozens of faculty, staff, and students. In a letter announcing the task force’s findings, President Faust wrote, “it is incumbent on all of us to do our part, to reach across difference, to find ways to ensure that every person on this campus has the chance to find intellectual, professional, and social fulfillment.” That commitment would soon be put to the test.
OGO: That night at 8:36 p.m., a college student called Harvard University Health Services to request assistance for their friend, a Black student at the College who had been standing naked on Massachusetts Avenue and was having a possible mental health crisis.
OGO: At the time, the Harvard College amnesty policy stated that “Any student may bring an intoxicated or drug-impaired friend to Harvard University Health Services or to a hospital, or seek assistance from College residential life staff or HUPD, and by doing this, neither they nor the friend will face disciplinary action from the College for having used or provided alcohol or drugs.” This policy, it seems, broke down that night.
OGO: Three minutes after the initial call, HUHS followed standard protocol and contacted the Harvard University Police Department. HUPD transferred the call to the Cambridge Police Department.
MNW: So I'm again standing on the concrete strip of sidewalk in the middle of mass ave, where on April 13 2018, Cambridge police officers assaulted and arrested a Black male student. Apparently one of the reasons that Harvard police officers didn't respond and Cambridge police did, is that this technically isn't Harvard's property, so it may not be under the HUPD jurisdiction. It's technically under Cambridge police jurisdiction. But as I'm just across the street from the law school, I'm going to walk onto Harvard property from the spot where the student was arrested and attacked. Starting to walk now … on the sidewalk … And now I'm on Harvard's property, I guess, under HUPD jurisdiction. In fact, to my right, there's a little blue light. It's one of those stations where I can request HUPD assistance or a night escort. And let's see, that light is another 10 steps away. So in total, maybe 33 steps from where the student was attacked to a blue light that in theory, Harvard students can use to ask for police or other assistance.
OGO: At 8:43 p.m., Cambridge police went to Cambridge Commons looking for a Black man who was quote-unquote ‘tripping,’ but saw no one meeting this description. The officers left.
OGO: Then, between 9:08 p.m. and 9:11 p.m., emergency communications received six calls, including from the original caller, about a naked Black male student near the Commons.
OGO: As a warning, the events I am about to describe depict police violence against a Black man. CPD arrived at the scene at 9:09 p.m. and located the student. A video that surfaced later that night, published by the Cambridge Police Department, depicts three officers, eventually joined by a fourth, surrounding the unclothed man and speaking with him for approximately two minutes. During this time, CPD requested an ambulance to the scene. Two minutes into the video, the student appears to take two steps toward one of the officers, toward the right side of the screen. Then, as the student begins to step back, an officer tackles him from behind.
OGO: Hilda M. Jordan, a college student in the class of 2019, saw the video that night after returning to her dorm after Yardfest:
Jordan: I remember being in my dorm. I probably had come back actually from yardfest festivities, I was a bit tired and I'm like, Okay, I’m going to turn in sort of earlyish for the night. And I remember being called by a couple of friends from the law school and then all of a sudden being sent the video and being told like, ‘Do you know what's happening?’ Like, this is happening, and before I knew it, I was just sort of in the midst, right. My first priority was figuring out, was the student okay.
OGO: Within hours of the arrest and the video circulating online, various groups and student organizations began to respond. Not surprisingly, undergrads and law school students, versus the Cambridge Police Department, interpreted the night quite differently. We’re going to compare those accounts. Matteo will be reading a statement by the Harvard Black Law Students Association the next day, and the other voice is that of Cambridge police commissioner Branville G. Bard.
CPD: At Friday evening at approximately 9:09 pm, our officers responded to the intersection of Massachusetts Avenue and Waterhouse call for service.
HBLSA (MNW): “On the evening of April 13th, a number of our current Harvard Black Law Students Association (HBLSA) members and admitted students witnessed a brutal instance of police violence at the intersection of Massachusetts Avenue and Waterhouse Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts. A naked, unarmed Black man, stood still on the median at the center of Massachusetts Avenue across from Harvard-Epworth United Methodist Church.
CPD: Officers responded, located the male, and verbally engaged him on the intersection, on the median area of Massachusetts Avenue. At some point it was learned from his acquaintances that he may have ingested hallucinogenic substances. Numerous attempts were made by the officers to calm down the male, but they were met w/ opposition and hostility and it escalated while officers attempted to speak with him.
HBLSA: He was surrounded by at least four Cambridge Police Department (CPD) officers who, without provocation, lunged at him, tackled him and pinned him to the ground.
CPD: After he was observed clenching his fists and moving toward officers, the decision was made to take the individual down. (1:52) his legs were grabbed, he was taken to the ground. Once on the ground, the individual continued to resist arrest. Three officers from the CPD and another officer from the transit police department were required to gain compliance with the male and place him in the handcuffs to avoid further injury to himself, responding officers, or others in the area.
HBLSA: While on the ground, at least one officer repeatedly punched the student in his torso as he screamed for help.
CPD: The male was subsequently transported to a local hospital for evaluation. While under transport he proceeded to spit a mixture of blood and saliva into the face of the paramedic or EMT.
HBLSA: The officers held him to the ground until paramedics arrived, placed him on a stretcher, and put him in the ambulance.
CPD: As a result of the incident, the individual is subject to being charged with indecent exposure, disorderly conduct, assault, resisting arrest, and assault and battery of ambulance personnel.
HBLSA: A pool of blood remained on the pavement as the ambulance departed. Shortly thereafter, firefighters came and cleaned up the blood with bleach and water.
OGO: HUPD officers arrived on scene at 9:19 p.m., three minutes after CPD requested Harvard police and by which time the student had been arrested and was in an ambulance for transport to Mt. Auburn Hospital. Harvard officers never saw him.
Segment 2
MNW: Hilda and others began organizing a student response that night:
Jordan: I mean as students this was really alarming and shocking because during orientation, I remember being told that you know HUPD will come get you in Boston, if you have a problem right, if you're too intoxicated… And here was a young Black man who was knocked over, but was actually shrieking and not responding to, was not responding coherently. And instead of meeting this need that the student had with what we believe to be competent and honestly just basic care, they disregarded this and actually made it a more violent interaction.
MNW: She and other undergrads formed a group called Black Students Organizing for Change and held a series of community conversations where students could support one another and come to a mutual understanding of what had gone wrong, and what they wanted done.
Jordan: I think for us the biggest issue was just questioning who would protect us, even when, especially when the systems that were designed to actually help us, literally turn their backs on this. So it was really about getting Harvard as an institution to recognize where it failed to protect the students, where it failed to, promoted a false sense of safety for a student and how in the height of police brutality… They would leave us to their hands, so it was just very insensitive and irresponsible from the institution standpoint, and our organizing was really about getting Harvard to reconcile with that and to really look at those the promises that it gave to students and what sort of institutional and system infrastructure was actually in place to care for students.
MNW: They began researching alternatives to police response and were in regular conversation with the Harvard Black Law Students Association, who were coordinating the students’ legal strategy and representation. On Saturday night, the HBLSA organized an event at the Law School in response to the event, which over 100 people attended.
Emanuel Powell: pretty much all I was doing all day was planning this event
MNW: This is Emanuel Powell, who at the time was on the HBLSA’s political action committee. The event was a healing space and a time to plan.
Emanuel Powell: We created a space for people to process how they were feeling. We invited local organizers to come and speak and engage with us on kind of what actions are already happening, and then shared what we as students were doing to support the student who was harmed. And so a big part of that was providing legal — there was an attorney, the Criminal Justice Initiative, I believe, at Harvard, or Criminal Justice Institute, we worked with them. The lead of that is BLSA’s faculty advisors. So they took on the case.
MNW: That May, the Cambridge Police dropped all charges against the student. This incidence of police violence didn’t occur in a vacuum, but with the backdrop of national outcry against police brutality, and near the campus of a university that has a 400 year history tied to slavery and hierarchy.
Emanuel (8:25): This is 2018, so we're not too far removed from, you know, exceptionally violent killings of people like Michael Brown, Jim Wilson — sorry. Michael Brown is who I'm thinking. But Eric Garner, trying to think what, who had happened at that time. Right before we had come in Alton Sterling had died, had been killed in 2016, before I started in law school. So like, all of these things were happening. And it wasn't that far removed. So I think people were just really struggling with this being so close and being thankful that this student lived. But just seeing how close this violence was, I think, and people were rightfully kind of angry at the University, for allowing this to happen. Cause this was a student, and so why was the student being brutalized by the Cambridge police department? Why hadn't anything been done to make sure that that didn't happen? And the other side of it was, Why hasn't Harvard had a stronger stance on making sure that violence didn't happen in the Cambridge community, generally, not just students, but period?
MNW: Afterwards, HBLSA published their own letter, which we read from earlier. They demanded “that Harvard University create an internal crisis response team to support students, faculty, and staff that does not involve CPD.” For Cambridge Police they wanted accountability, writing, “The conduct of the CPD on the evening of April 13, 2018 was unacceptable. We are reminded, as soon-to-be-graduates of an elite law school that we cannot protect our bodies with our degrees — and that is why we also call our current students and alumni to embrace these demands as inclusive to all Black people, not just Harvardians.”
Jordan: We had, you know, multiple conversations with different stakeholders from the Harvard police department, the Harvard Dean of Student Life, the office I think for Diversity and Inclusion also was heavily involved. So we had different deans and administrators that were also trying to quickly understand what students were feeling and what students were thinking, as we were working.
MNW: Three days after the incident, on April 16, then-University President Drew Faust addressed the events in a letter to the Harvard community, writing, ‘The events of Friday night are profoundly disturbing.’ She mentioned ‘the backdrop of increasingly urgent questions about race and policing in the United States.’ She vowed the University would review the issue and make needed improvements. Hilda was heartened by Faust’s response, which she saw as a sign of good-faith effort. But as an activist, she was also wary of being pacified.
Jordan: That was an asset to balance, primarily because we wanted to make sure that we were still being impactful with our actions. So for example our actual protest was organized offline, so that the institution couldn’t close off the yard or you know try to curtail traffic and weaken the event. So we did it sort of just by word of mouth and text messages. The day of and we were able to get, you know, nearly 300 people to show up and protest around the Harvard University building, like that gray building in the middle of the yard.
MNW: The protest was held during Visitas, the visiting weekend for admitted students at Harvard.
OGO: Weren’t we admitted students visiting campus at the time? We were high school seniors in 2018, freshly admitted. I remember walking around campus for the first time, Visitas itinerary in hand, and seeing some students wearing masks standing silently next to the John Harvard statue.
Jordan: This is one of the few weekends that Harvard really cares about, I think. Harvard, like most universities, but maybe even more so than other universities, is really concerned with its appearance and how it's perceived to the outside world and incoming students and alum. I don't know that they care as much about the students while they're there, but getting us there and getting our money once you're out is really key.
MNW: That weekend, leading up to the protest, BSOC — that new organization founded immediately after the incident — published a letter to the Harvard administration, making a set of 10 demands. They wrote, “the incident of police violence raised fears about the actions of the Cambridge Police Department and shed light on structural failures of Harvard University’s emergency response policies.
MNW: Their demands included support for the students’ needs, an extensive report on what happened, establishing an internal crisis response team, a formal designation of all drug- and alcohol-related calls to HUHS as medical emergencies, hiring Black and Brown mental health counselors, mental health response training for all HUPD officers, and more.
MNW: During Visitas, over 200 students, mostly dressed in Black, first gathered at the Phillips Brooks House to prepare. At noon, they paired off and spread themselves across Harvard Yard, holding signs reading “I Don’t Feel Safe” and “Will Harvard Call the Police on Me Too?”
Jordan: We had folks team up in groups of two, so the idea was like, if you're holding a poster you wouldn't talk. One of you could hand out the papers to ongoers.
MNW: The pairs of students, one speaking and one with red duct tape over their mouth, stayed this way for 40 minutes, what they said was the length of time between the first call for help and HUPD officers arriving.
Jordan: Protesting is an act that is both for the observer and the onlooker to raise awareness, but also to build internal solidarity and consciousness, right. For us it was really about how we spread through the yard, right. Like we spread out in an X, with University Hall as the center, and tried to get you know the main exit and entry points through the, through the yard, so that folks could, wouldn't really walk — like maybe you could walk past the first person and not really know what's going on, but then you see another person about 10 steps away. Then you also look back and you're like, ‘Oh, well, there's another one and there's another one.’ When you start to read the signs and it's like, ‘Wow, this is what's happening here.’
MNW: After 40 minutes, they gathered around University Hall and observed two minutes of silence, the time between CPD calling for HUPD officers and Harvard officers getting to the scene. Then they began to chant
Protestors: Treat me, don’t beat me
MNW: Hilda hadn’t intended to give a speech that day, but the moment overcame her.
Jordan: the day of, I ended up getting a mic handed to me as we sat around University Hall [...] and I just started to think about how many folks with mental illnesses had been killed by the police that year […] and how our response to dealing with societal failures or even like people's personal needs is to truly just beat them or kill them when they are Black and Latino and marginalized and brown people. So it was really a powerful time when we were able to sit there and just realize that so many other people see this and understand this problem, and are fighting to make the world better. And I just, you know, sat there in that moment and recognized that like wow, as the world is realizing the long history of police brutality that has plagued the United States and particularly the Black community in the US, right. We're fighting it right on this campus that's supposed to be the beacon of privilege and elitism and that we have, we're the Chosen Few that allegedly have made it and you know, are the golden ones, quote unquote, by Harvard's own reputation, and not even that can save us while walking home, right. So, it was just fitting in how close to home this came and how genuinely and truly this could be any one of us, how it has been friends, family members of people, and how it always happens without reason
Jordan: to see how many folks were using their voice, were lifting up and taking up the call and wanted to be present and be a part of this change. And so it was, there was a lot, and I remember, ultimately being on the mic and as we yelled just treat me, don't beat me…
Jordan: ...really feeling it with every fiber of my body and starting to cry, because I truly felt like I was just crying to the institution to have them care for us and not leave us dejected to violence, right. And as a first generation college student, immigrant Black woman Latina, it just, it felt so true for all of the times that Harvard had caused me true like mental and emotional duress and hadn't provided me with any resources to accommodate for that and how often, and how quickly or easily even it could have been me intoxicated unresponsive to my friends being brutalized by the Cambridge police department. And, you know, unsure whether or not I was going to graduate, ultimately because I was under this ridiculous amount of pressure and isolation that I couldn't really explain to a lot of my non-Black peers and that most people at Harvard sort of look at me and be like, What are you talking about?
Segment 3
OGO: Two weeks after her initial statement and shortly after the Visitas protest, Faust announced a committee led by several members of the Harvard faculty to review mental health resources, community policing, and more at the College.
Jordan: I think for us, it did have an effect because that was, it was shortly thereafter that the committee was sort of formed, or at least it was announced that the committee would be formed. In my time at Harvard I hadn't quite seen a response so quickly. Where typically you know it's like, okay, after a month or two months, then we will create a committee, we will talk about creating a committee, it will take us a whole summer to found it, to create a committee. Then once we create the committee it'll take us another year to have investigations and conversations and then we'll release our findings, you know, in another three months, which will only be recommendations. And then we'll have another six months to talk about implementation and before you know it, it's been two years, and the students who were first complaining about this are either, you know, are seniors, juniors or have already left. And by the time you're that far through your Harvard career you have a lot of other things that you're just sort of trying to keep up with and worrying about. So for us it was really, we were really pressed to make the University respond before we left campus.
OGO: The review committee consisted of seven members of Harvard’s faculty and staff, tapping into leading scholars on law, racial justice, mental health, and more. It was led by Annette Gordon-Reed, the Charles Warren Professor of American Legal History at Harvard Law School, and included professors from FAS, the business school, medical school, and graduate school of education, as well as a senior policy adviser and a dean of faculty development. All seven declined or did not respond to multiple requests for interviews.
MNW: The committee’s charge, Faust wrote, was as follows: “The committee will start by determining the sequence of events leading to the student’s arrest. It will seek to gain an understanding of how the College, HUHS, and HUPD responded to (and were able to respond to) events such as those that occurred in this instance. That understanding, in turn, will inform a more systematic examination of opportunities for improvement across a range of institutional activities.”
OGO: It’s worth noting that just the previous month Faust had announced the findings of the Presidential Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging, a giant, two-year effort to assess and reorient Harvard to make it more inclusive. We’ll dig into that presidential task force in our third episode, but this event clearly showed the urgency, the life-and-death stakes, of turning that task force’s recommendations into reality.
MNW: Yeah, the final report of this 2018 HUPD review actually highlights the presidential task force as evidence that, “The University has recently taken various steps that demonstrate its commitment to building and fostering a community that is inclusive and welcoming for its members.”
OGO: I might emphasize the word demonstrate — it’s a display of commitment, but in and of itself not evidence of change.
MNW: This review committee met several times throughout the summer of 2018, gathering information about what happened leading up to, during, and after the arrest. They broke into smaller working groups, reviewed documents, and spoke with HUPD officers, students, administrators, HUHS workers, and more. After Hilda so cynically described the Harvard review committee process and her skepticism of it, I wanted to hear what she thought of this particular committee, the one that she was hopeful about because of the speed of its formation. But, during two calls she had with the reviewers over the summer, she was disheartened.
Jordan: they were very dismissive, and it felt very condescending from the student angle. Which was hard, but not unexpected because again right, here are a bunch of quote-unquote experts on these issues who don't care to hear what a group of kids who are going to be leaving anyways have to, like have to say about how to use University dollars. And their biggest thing I remember was that they kept focusing on you know, the student's drug use. They tried to make this an individual instance and talk about how the student had failed. And I remember one of the questions even being like, how much sleep had he gotten. And it was, the turn very much was the move away from any institutional failure or even system failure and to try and focus more on like, well, was this a reasonable thing to expect from a student or like, should he have handled this better [...] So I would say that I, I don't say that I have a cynical view in as much as I feel just like, an accurate view, if that makes sense, the expense of what these committees are also meant to do, right.
MNW: The question, then, is what are such review committees intended to do — respond to a crisis, enact structural change, or something else entirely? What was this particular committee intended to do? Hilda was, to say the least, suspicious.
Jordan: I don't think that the folks that are, that usually end up on these committees are really seeking to fundamentally change something about the institution or to really understand what the student issues are.
MNW: The answer lies in the committee’s final report, 34 pages and issued in November. The reviewers split their findings and recommendations into four subcategories that all fall under what the reviewers called a “Foundational commitment,” which was: “As an academic institution committed to expanding opportunity and creating a diverse community that enhances the learning of every student, Harvard should be proactive, innovative, and resourceful in its efforts to create the conditions that allow the members of our community to reach their highest potential.” Hilda remembers,
Jordan: we were disappointed to the extent that like, we wondered when and how these would be implemented. But I do think we were happy to see that our calls had been heard, right. I think it was like, there was a clear recognition that this issue was being contextualized in a larger setting and I think we were, we were satisfied with that to some, to some extent.
OGO: I mean, this ‘foundational commitment’ is vague, but neither of us would disagree with it: Yes, Harvard should be supporting everybody in the community. But there’s no specific who — Harvard should support everyone, but perhaps some groups of people, like students of color or first generation students, could reap more benefit from that support.
OGO: It’s also important to remember that it’s not only the reviewers doing this work. A lot of the time, the labor to push Harvard to conduct these reviews falls on the students most harmed by the very problems they want addressed. Emanuel really stressed that when I talked to him:
Emanuel: I mean, the only thing that I’d probably add that we haven't necessarily talked about, it's like, a lot of that labor ends up falling on students of color, low income students, queer students. So a lot of this activism or a desire to change is somewhat personal, because you want the institution to be an institution that you feel comfortable at, or don't feel bad about being at.
MNW: And then the University tries to channel all of that physical and emotional labor into a 34 page document. Those pages have a lot to live up to.
Jordan: this wasn't just, this was about the individual student and this individual instant, but it was also about what Harvard is doing in a larger context to deal with police brutality and to deal with the isolation and fear and lack of safety that its marginalized students face.
OGO: That’s a high bar for seven reviewers, no matter how talented.
MNW: And it should be! Harvard is supposed to produce the best scholarship and thinking and leaders in the world. They don’t get the “Harvard A.” I think we should go through the report and its recommendations. The committee outlines what happened in great detail, quotes from community discussions, all the usual you’d expect. Then they list four principles, which roughly break down into: (1) reforming campus policing, (2) reforming mental health services and supporting students of color, (3) changing the Yardfest festival itself, and (4) coordinating across Harvard’s various schools to better act as “One Harvard.”
OGO: Alright, let’s review the review — something we’re going to do a lot throughout this podcast. What was recommended in each of those categories? And what came of those recommendations?
Segment 4
MNW: Before we take a closer look at the recommendations that came out of this University committee convened in response to the police arrest of a Black student at Harvard on the night of April 13, 2018, it might be good to recall our context in 2021, as well as that of policing and anti-Black racism in this country more broadly. We’ve just gone through what might be remembered as the summer of Black Lives Matter.
MNW: To understand the significance of the protests that erupted this summer, we spoke with someone much more knowledgeable about these issues than either of us.
Cornell W Brooks: My name is Cornell William Brooks. I serve as the Hauser professor of nonprofit organizations, and a professor for public leadership and social justice at the Harvard Kennedy School. And in my previous life has served as president-ceo of the NAACP, whereIit did a great amount of work with organizations around the country on police reform, transformation, abolition.
MNW: Thank you. Yeah, so I guess. Before we started talking about the Harvard specific context. Generally you yourself, and many activists, lawyers, and others have been working on sort of trying to reform and change police departments for decades, and I'm sort of wondering if you could tell me a little bit about the efforts that people take and the reforms they have tried to push for and what makes, kind of what makes these departments resistant to or difficult to change.
CWB: it's a good question at a morally poignant moment, namely in the wake of the George Floyd protests, where 25 million Americans across 550 jurisdictions across the United States and millions more people around the world took to the streets against police brutality. But those protests and the protests of the moment take place against a historical backdrop. So as you know the police departments, particularly in the south in this country, emerged from the slave patrols of the century before last. And so literally when you look at the badges of sheriffs and police officers they're often stars, and those stars literally look like the stars of the badges of slave patrols, but why do we know that similarity. Because policing in this country has been about law enforcement, but is also been about social control. [...]
CWB: This is a national problem in terms of its consistency is uniformity, its historicity. But it's also a local problem and it says that you have an 18,000 police departments of which Harvard is but one. And so the point being here is this is a long standing problem, deeply rooted in American history that's taken on a certain intensity. Literally, and come of age, if you will, at the time of your college attendance.
MNW: We’ll hear much more from Brooks in later episodes. What’s important to note is that, when Harvard announces an external review, in the summer of 2020 or the spring of 2018, of the Harvard University Police Department, more is at stake than the presence of police in dining halls or particular racist incidents. There is a history, a legacy, an infusion of anti-Black racism that stretches back 400 years to this country’s, and Harvard’s, origins.
MNW: Returning to the 2018 review surrounding HUPD, the first principle was, quoting from the report, “When members of our community need help, they should have the information they need to confidently access university and other emergency services, and to have an accurate understanding of what to expect from the response.” The specific recommendations were to better communicate what students can expect of HUPD, “assessing the desirability” of including mental health professionals in police responses, and clarifying Harvard’s relationship with surrounding police departments in incidents outside of HUPD jurisdiction.
OGO: Including mental health professionals is promising, as is clarifying to students the role of HUPD. But at the same time this focus on better communication kind of toes the line between reforming the police and blaming citizens for not understanding what they can expect of police, as if it were mostly an awareness problem, that the students should have known better and police did nothing wrong.
MNW: Part of it might stem from how the immediate facts of this incident don’t explicitly betray racism on the part of HUPD. Harvard police didn’t technically attack or arrest this student. They failed to respond in time. So from an administrator’s perspective this might have been just an infrastructure problem, a communications problem, an administrative problem — maybe not a policing problem, maybe not a product of structural racism. Of course that misses the point, but it’s plausible.
OGO: Sure, but then we’re isolating the issue, taking it out of the broader context of policing and anti-Black racism that Brooks outlined. And if you do that then you need accountability for Cambridge police. None of the Cambridge officers were disciplined. An independent review of Cambridge police officers’ conduct, led by a former Massachusetts Supreme Court Justice, stated, “I carefully considered all of the evidence and circumstances and conclude that the officers of the Cambridge Police Department acted appropriately and I found no evidence that they used excessive force.” After that review, CPD implemented some new trainings and guidelines, like implicit bias training for officers. So one could take this finding at its word — but four officers, beating up a 21-year old in distress? Come on. In which case, this finding that CPD officers acted according to policy may be just evidence of the policy, the system, being broken. And so if we absolve HUPD of responsibility, and then CPD, where are we left?
MNW: But I don’t think the review absolves HUPD. They include many voices highly critical of police presence at Harvard. That being said, you may have a point, that isolating the issue, not thinking big enough, might have been a problem. Because even if we assume best intentions and that these recommendations were at least considered, it’s not clear they were carried out, or at least not effectively. The same concerns about Harvard police from 2018 all show up, in altered wording, in the 21CP review from December 2020: distrust of HUPD, no clarity about their role, a need to consider medically trained first responders rather than police, and so on. I even talked to some students who sat in focus groups with the 21CP Solutions reviewers. One was Carter Nakamoto, who in 2020 was on the Undergraduate Council. Carter, after hearing about the recommendations in the 2018 report to consider having mental health professionals as first responders, had a curious recollection about the focus group:
Carter Nakamoto: there was a session at this meeting, obviously at length about, you know, the yardfest in 2018
MNW: and the 21CP reviewers brought up that after this incident, students were calling for mental health professionals to be first responders rather than police
CN: it sounds like this is something that they were heavily considering in their report [...] it's fascinating that they brought that up, specifically in response to concerns raised in the context of the 2018 yardfest incident. And given, given that like, I don't think any of the council members knew that like this was literally one of the recommendations in the 2018 report.”
MNW: One of the 21CP reviewers, Brenda Bond, told me she doesn’t remember whether they read the 2018 report, but even if they did, since they didn’t cite it in the final review it likely did not inform their findings.
OGO: So 21CP knew about what happened in 2018, but not about the 2018 report? Then why make the report at all in the first place, if nobody’s going to read it? It’s an institutional memory that is not supposed to be accessed, or at very least, that is not going to be accessed. Or, it’s almost as if, back in 2018, University admin expected this single report would resolve the problem — as if they thought no one would be talking about the same issues two years later.
MNW: It’s also this weird duality of, HUPD couldn’t help this student in 2018 because he was like 20 steps off of Harvard’s property, but then they could help Boston police at a Black Lives Matter rally that was most certainly not Harvard property.
OGO: Almost as if, if the University had taken the 2018 report seriously and truly reconsidered the role police have to play in Harvard and at large, student outrage at HUPD presence at a BLM protest in 2020 was avoidable. This is so frustrating — it’s also, because Harvard is big and decentralized and can be so opaque, really hard for us to say how much of that was decentralized administration struggling to implement things, or a resistant police force, or resistant leadership, or administration not taking the review seriously, or if good-faith efforts were made but what they thought of was ineffective, or some combination of all of those. But I guess regardless of the explanation, that first resolution, about changes to HUPD itself, fell short. What about the other three?
MNW: Maybe not so surprisingly, it’s mostly more of the same. The second principle centers around Harvard University Health Services, HUPD, and all of campus supporting, quote, “All members of our vibrant and diverse academic community” — in plain English, Harvard health and safety resources can fail students of color. The committee gave suggestions for how to remedy that, and Harvard has implemented many of those suggestions, like providing “training for multicultural competency in mental health support” or updating HUPD policy to serve a “diverse community” or more diverse hiring practices in HUHS.
OGO: We can’t exactly trace a cause-and-effect relationship between specific changes and this particular review committee. Again, it’s unclear how effective these changes have been, because the very problems these changes were meant to solve persist. For instance, if student experience is the metric here, there’s not been significant improvement on the mental health front.
MNW: Right. Just this past year the Provost’s office spent months producing a gargantuan report on mental health at Harvard, which they published in summer 2020. On the one hand that effort shows dedication to student mental health. On the other hand, that task force reported very similar problems and disparities regarding mental health services, especially for students from disadvantaged backgrounds.
OGO: Alright, so we could be cynical and say Harvard fell short or didn’t commit itself to principle two. But we could also be charitable and say this kind of change, to the culture and values and core systems of the University, is hard to make and will be slow. And maybe the problems are the same, but someone, somewhere, is thinking about them. Although maybe all that thinking gets in the way of doing. But let’s keep going. What about the third principle, changes to Yardfest?
MNW: I was just going to get there. That is the set of recommendations from the 2018 review that the University made the most explicit statements about and, from my reporting, for which it verifiably implemented almost all of the recommendations. These were changes like making a more secure boundary around Yardfest, having more water available, moving the concert to Sunday, increasing police presence — all of which happened the following year.
OGO: Wait a second. So you’re telling me that Harvard commissioned a team to systematically review College policy, mental health, and community policing, and the most explicit “improvement” to a “range” of activities it was meant to address was to Yardfest? A one-day event which I have never even attended?
MNW: Well, that’s one way to put it. But it’s not like the reviewers had the authority to implement their recommendations. And it does seem like updating Yardfest procedure would be easier than, say, rehauling HUPD.
OGO: Right, the review couldn’t require Harvard to enact specific policies — which is part of the problem. It almost makes the report into an act of image-preservation. And it’s not like the review made many actual policy recommendations. It’s so vague.
MNW: And we can say principle four, to act as One Harvard, is similarly vague and hard to trace. It’s about coordinating communications and health services across the schools, which probably happened, but is too general to really evaluate or trace to this specific report.
OGO: So the 2018 recommendations were precisely what they were labeled: principles, but not action items. Two years later, people may have suffered as a result, and we’re asking the same questions.
Abolish HUPD protest: Why does an institution that claims to embrace dialogue and debate need a private army with untold rounds of live ammunition?
OGO: There are new student voices calling out Harvard and its police force for the same things — new slogans, new particular grievances, more precise and articulated demands and criticisms, but all to the same tune as Hilda in 2018.
Jordan: Thinking through and trying to understand what is a reasonable timeline for institutional change. I think that's one of the hardest things to understand and advocate for as a student, because our time at these institutions are so short. And I think for me it's also like what like what is my ability to follow up on these things when it's not a part of, you know, my, it's not it's not a part of my coursework, I'm not getting paid to do this, it's emotionally taxing. I have to sort of relive and then do it [...]
Jordan: I am starting to see a bit more is that the students do have a lot more power than I think we realize oftentimes, but because we don't always have the institutional memory that the administration does or professors do, it's hard to see and understand that. So, yeah, I guess it's just a long way of saying that I'm a bit impatient when it comes to institutional change, but mostly because these problems, like you mentioned before, right, have been going on for years and years and years [...]
Jordan: I feel like, until the institution starts doing things differently or trying to do things differently, we're only going to keep identifying the new iteration of the same problem so we'll get the specifics of how it happened this time, but not really catch the larger problem, like the larger structural issue, if that makes sense.
OGO: So how do we make sense of all this? HUPD officers themselves didn’t attack the student, but the incident brings up enormous and valid criticisms of HUPD that seem to be as, if not more, valid today, two years later. Harvard listened back then, at least somewhat. But maybe not closely enough? Because everything the University missed, or willfully ignored, or even silenced — those issues are coming back to haunt it.
MNW: But rather than being a specter, it’s all too real. I think, and bear with me here, we need to take a detour. To understand 2020 and 2021, we turned back to a flashpoint from 2018 — a time that, despite not having been on campus to experience, we are hyper-aware of and is, in some ways, a part of our experiences as students.
OGO: This would be a good time to acknowledge our own positions — I’m a white person who does not feel the physical and emotional impacts of University and structural racism like Black and brown people do.
MNW: I’m half-white and half-Chinese, and in a similar position of privilege. We want to foreground the voices of students like Hilda or Emanuel, and we’re not claiming them as our own. Rather, we’re embarking on an exploration of racism and Harvard’s institutional responses to it. To that end, rewinding a bit further could help — to a time when you and I were not even alive, but which we, once again, might not just identify with, but feel is a part of us. Not our lived history, but an affect, a zeitgeist, that resonates all the same. Harvard may not remember this history, but we can dig it up.
OGO: Hmm. What are you suggesting?
MNW: Not 2018, or 2020, but May of 1980. A time when Harvard College’s population was somewhere between 15 and 20 percent minority, and the Lampoon had just published a cover of a Black boy shining John Harvard’s shoes, and the Crimson had just taken images of two random Black students and drawn bars over them to make art for an editorial on prison uprisings. We can, I think, trace many of the discussions we’re having today back to that time period, that May — because, early in that month, Harvard released the results of a multi-year effort to study diversity at the College, one of the earliest in a long string of reports trying to do the same. They called it, “A Study of Race Relations at Harvard College.”

About Under Review:
How can Harvard, an institution with so much history, have so little memory?
The racial reckonings and Black Lives Matter protests that swept the country this past summer brought attention to a trend in how Harvard seems to deal with student activism and concerns surrounding race, racism, and diversity: to commission a diversity review. These committees and reports long predate this summer, and reading them it can seem, at times, like some things have not changed at the University — in race relations, Harvard’s review process, or the findings and recommendations. What can these diversity reviews accomplish, and what can’t they?
“Under Review” is a podcast from The Harvard Crimson, hosted by Matteo Wong and Olivia Oldham, chairs of The Crimson’s weekly magazine, Fifteen Minutes. Each week, they will explore controversies and diversity reviews stretching across 40 years of Harvard history, speaking to dozens of students, activists, experts, and more, to try and understand how the Harvard diversity review works — or doesn’t.

OGO: Last time, on Under Review:
Visitas protest: Black Lives Matter, at Harvard, too.
Cornell W. Brooks: You have 18,000 police departments, of which Harvard is but one.
Carter Nakamoto: I don't think any of the council members knew that like this was literally one of the recommendations in the 2018 report
Sylvester Monroe: even after three and a half years at Harvard, I still find it extremely difficult, even impossible to think of myself as a Harvard man, quote-unquote. Instead, I feel more like a guest in a strange house where my welcome is all but run out. I am nearing the end of a four year visit during which I have never felt at home...
OGO: If we told you that a Black student at Harvard said this today, you might not be completely taken aback. Only this summer, HUPD officers were seen policing a BLM protest; only seven years ago the “I, Too, Am Harvard” campaign and performance, based on interviews with Black Harvard students, brought national attention to the pervasive racism at this institution:
Speaker from “I, Too, Am Harvard”: It was the first time in a long time I had felt the burden of being Black in the classroom, and being Black walking around Harvard’s campus [...] So I go to harvard, I’m not really of harvard, I don’t feel like a typical Harvard student. And it took a while and it took a lot of experiences to prove that, I, too am Harvard.
OGO: But, in fact, the first quote was from an essay published in 1973 and read aloud by its author, Sylvester Monroe ’73, who has since had an extremely successful career as a journalist.
Monroe: The problem is that the traditional Harvard just isn't my Harvard, the Harvard of my experience has been three years of a totally Black existence. Black roommates, Black friends, Black dining hall tables, Black dances, Black student organizations, Black building takeovers, Black Studies, and Black ideology, all isolated within the confines of an otherwise white University.
OGO: Monroe’s essay, “Guests in a Strange House,” is about this totally Black existence. Although parts of it echo to the present, Harvard was also a very different, and far less diverse, campus in the 1970s. Prior to 1970, Harvard had admitted fewer than 100 Black students. In 1977, Black students made up about 7 percent of undergraduates, and total minority enrollment was 14 percent. The first co-ed graduation ceremony between Harvard and Radcliffe was held in 1970, and Harvard Yard only opened to female residents in 1972. Monroe wrote,
Monroe: Beginning in the mid 60s, Harvard and a steadily growing group of Black students began feeling their way through a totally new experience, kind of great experiment in which a handful of confused and frightened Black kids found themselves charged with the mental task of developing better racial relations with a scared and uncertain white college community.
OGO: In this evolving Harvard, with a Black student population the institution could no longer ignore, the Dean of Students Archie Epps, one of the first Black administrators at Harvard, put together a committee to review race relations at the College. The committee had dozens of students and administrators that worked for multiple years, analyzing data from over 1000 survey responses and numerous community conversations. They published their findings in a 138-page report, “A Study of Race Relations at Harvard College,” in May of 1980. I’m Olivia Oldham,
MNW: And I’m Matteo Wong.
OGO: You’re listening to Under Review, a podcast from The Crimson’s weekly magazine, Fifteen Minutes, in which we explore the way Harvard most often seems to deal with race and raciMonroe: a diversity review. In this episode, we’re rewinding to the beginning of Harvard’s reckoning with race, racism, and race relations — back to one of its first diversity reviews — and putting those formative years in conversation with the present.
MNW: I stumbled across the 1980 study of race relations while reporting another piece on Asian American activism at Harvard. At the same time I was writing that piece, spring of 2019, I started noticing these flyers in all of the dining halls and public spaces about some “pulse” survey. Those signs read, “10 questions, 3 minutes, your voice.” It seemed like a quick survey asking questions about inclusivity at Harvard, pretty typical stuff. I didn’t pay it much attention. So I was shocked, when, the following fall, Harvard published the pulse survey results and declared that “in the spring of 2019, for the first time in its history, Harvard asked everyone in its community to share perceptions about inclusion and belonging at Harvard in order to count the individual experiences of every single Harvard community member.”
MNW: The first time? Hadn’t Harvard done something quite similar, 40 years earlier? Wasn’t it sitting there in the archives, for anyone to see? Why does the 1980 study on race relations seem to have been forgotten — and what might it tell us about Harvard then, and how it’s evolved to the present day?
Florence Houn: I recall this image as statue of john Harvard sitting. And at his feet, was a caricature of a Black boy shining john Harvard's shoes
Sylvester Monroe: “Many of us were scared to death. And we've banded together for safety for, for, because we didn't know where else to turn to get it”
Adela Cepeda: Frankly, I wasn’t originally included… there was not a Latino voice there
Donald Barfield: we can't just stop at the study, you have to force people to say, ‘Okay, what are you going to do?’
Segment 1
MNW: The 1980 report, when I viewed it, was a slim booklet in the archives, Black ink on only slightly-yellowing white paper filled with charts, survey results, and paragraph upon paragraph of text in what I believe was Courier font. There were no adornments, colors, or images outside of numerous statistical graphs.
OGO: To understand this report, which is about the state of race relations at Harvard — and in particular between Black and white students, as the number of Asian, Latinx, Indigenous, and other students was very, very small — we have to understand more about Harvard at the time, more than just the most visible protest movements or basic statistics. We need context — so I asked Monroe about what led him to write his essay:
Monroe: my existence at Harvard, after that freshman, and during much of that freshman year, and afterwards was almost a completely Black existence, except for the classes that I took, and the interactions that I had with teachers and professors. And part of that was just the climate at the time. It was a really radical and political time, they spring before Harvard had been through the strike, in which people demonstrated against the Vietnam War, and other issues. In my freshman year, the Harvard Afro took over University Hall, twice
Monroe: I mean, in some ways we were these privileged kids, even though all of us didn't come from privileged backgrounds. But once we got to Harvard, we certainly became privileged. These privileged kids looking for causes.
OGO: In his first year at Harvard, Monroe had been involved in large-scale activist causes. But after his freshman year, he began to notice the smaller issues that Black students around him faced in their daily lives at Harvard. He began to feel that Black students had been forgotten by the University.
Monroe: And when I, when that strongly started to dawn upon me was when one of my turn time jobs was tutoring in sophomore year, tutoring freshmen in expository writing, at the Bureau of study counsel, and I came across students, Black and white, who though they were at Harvard, could not, were terrorized at the thought of having to write a paper longer than one or two pages. Luckily for me, one of the ways I got through Harvard was writing papers. I was very good at it, and I liked to do it and I did very well. And so that job, but I came across these, what alarmed me was not so much the white students that needed help in writing. But I came across Black students who needed help in writing. And it suddenly dawned upon me that, you know, while we're out here protesting and some of the other things we protested was about was about how we felt like Harvard, we had been brought to Harvard and sort of abandoned, abandoned, and since they put people there with very little support for students. Once you got there, it was as if, okay, you've accepted Harvard, now you've made it, you're on your own.
Monroe: I began to question the all Black existence that I, that I was sort of leading at the University and thinking that, you know, my Black fellow classmates, some of them were fooling themselves, I thought, I thought if, you know, it's okay to put on this front for everybody else. But if you know you're having trouble writing, if you know you're having trouble in other kinds of ways and other subjects, then we're at Harvard. Where better to fix them, to take care of them? And so that's why I decided to write that piece. I caught hell. Yeah? for writing a piece from my, from many of my peers. [...]
Monroe: Looking back. I have been a journalist all my life. I mean, I was hired straight out of Harvard to be a correspondent in the Boston bureau of Newsweek. I can't think of, there are very few things I can think of that have withstood the test of time and that stand up and are as important as what I wrote in the Saturday review in 1973.
OGO: Monroe wrote ‘A Strange House’ after he had started to question his ‘all-Black existence’ at Harvard. But I wondered if he considered this existence to be one of self-preservation.
Monroe: It was absolutely created out of self preservation. It was not — it was viewed at the time by others as being anti-white, anti-University. It was an anti nothing. It was, I mentioned to you that we felt, some of us felt so, some of us were scared, although we, you know, I think I said in the piece, you know, like James Brown, talking loud and saying nothing. And, you know, we put on a good front. Many of us were scared to death. And we've banded together for safety for, for, because we didn't know where else to turn to get it. And, as I said, it was taken as a statement of anti Harvard, anti white, it really was anti nothing. It was pro us. And it was about protecting ourselves.
MNW: Hearing him describe that — invisibility to the white mainstream, of both Black students and the problems they faced — it makes sense that the committee to study race relations wrote in their 1980 report that they weren’t responding to a specific incident. Racism was in the water; in the air.
OGO: And on top of that there’s an outpouring of activism in the 60s and 70s, especially among nonwhite students, around apartheid divestment and affirmative action and African American studies and Third World liberation and more. The causes resonate, in many ways, with those of today: prison divestment, admissions lawsuit, ethnic studies, anti-policing.
MNW: Right — so if you were looking in the slightest, the problems were obvious and everywhere — just like today. Still, I can’t help thinking that one incident started this report, a controversial cover of the Lampoon, which is a well-known Harvard student humor magazine, from the spring of 1977. The study of race relations mentions this cover and a lot of its members recall it. Florence Houn, class of 1980, was very active in student activism as an undergraduate. She recalls putting an image of the cover in a press packet put out by the Third World students movement at Harvard in 1980:
Florence Houn: I remember going over the press packet with one of the members of the press. So, to me I recall this image as a statue of John Harvard sitting. And at his feet, was a caricature of a Black boy shining John Harvard's shoes. I believe that came out, maybe in 77 or 76. It was not 1980 when it came out, was a couple of years ago, was one of several incidents that we had put in the packet, including the, the, The Hasty Pudding production of a show that featured a character egg foo young. That was a Chinese racist character. And there were other incidents in the press packet but I remember those two vividly.
OGO: The list of racist incidents seems endless.
MNW: And so egregious. The Crimson itself, just before the Study of Race Relations was released, published an image rivaling the Lampoon in its awfulness. Donald Barfield, a graduate student who worked on the 1980 report, recalls a Village Voice article on this image in The Crimson:
Donald Barfield: “The bloody riot at the New Mexico State Penitentiary near Santa Fe, New Mexico is pretty far away from the Crimson office. And there was no way to get an appropriate photograph to go with the article. So [...] someone, and the conspiracy of silence would not reveal who, inserted a photo of two Harvard undergraduates, both Black, and drew vertical bars over their faces to simulate a prison door. Neither student was asked his permission.”
Segment 2
OGO: It’s the fall of 1977. Harvard is just starting to bring in significant numbers of nonwhite students. The racial atmosphere is hostile, yet at the same time that hostility is largely unacknowledged by the University’s white population.
MNW: Which is exactly what Barfield wanted to address with this report. He was a sociology student and proctor at the time, and he’s made a career of education and equity assessments. He felt Harvard in the 70s...
Barfield: wasn't necessarily overtly hostile. It was kind of, you were invisible to a certain degree. And then there's a level of insensitivity that, you know, came up with the National Lampoon publication, you know, that was in 77, I think.
MNW: Barfield and Dean Epps were the masterminds behind this study of race relations. It grew out of conversation between Epps, Barfield, and others at the College invested in supporting Black undergraduates. Epps brought together 10 undergrads and six faculty and administrators, all hoping to improve the Harvard experience for nonwhite students, and made the committee. Their charge was three-fold: first, to “review the pattern of interaction between white and nonwhite students,” second, to see how race affected the learning environment for students of color, and third, to suggest ways to improve things for minority students.
Barfield: This was so novel, you know, information gathering to try to kind of understand and be able to describe, with some reliability, you know, what was occurring, and what people were experiencing, and what they thought.
OGO: Crazy that trying to learn about the presence and negative effects of racism was “novel.”
MNW: Now, sure. But maybe not then — remember what Monroe said about this being a sort of experiment for the College and its growing Black undergraduate population. We can start to quantify this — how little a lot of Harvard’s white population thought about race and racism. The 1980 study of race relations found that Black students were twice as likely as white students to perceive racial prejudice existed among peers, and four times as likely to perceive racial prejudice from faculty. Yet at the same time, the overwhelming majority of white students thought promoting diversity was good. So white undergrads professed to support minorities, but had no idea what that entailed.
Barfield: we’d just come out of the late 60s, and all that turmoil. The university had, I think, embraced affirmative action to a degree, you know, in terms of at least the numbers. I would say that, you know, so you had a steady increase in minority student presence at the college. But my characterization would be, it was, the question was how you fit in. As opposed to how the, how you would ask today, when we talk about inclusion, how the group defines the culture that's present, as opposed to basically, you know, kind of fitting into a privileged culture. And I think that, more or less, it was more, more aggregate, aggregative versus integrative, you know. So, you know, basically say, what, how many Blacks you have, Hispanics, Asians, how many social clubs you have, you get to counting numbers, but they're not in any way particularly integrated.
OGO: He’s saying, it sounds like, that Harvard had begun to show an investment in bringing Black and other nonwhite students to campus, but wasn’t really invested in their success once they had arrived. It’s not so far off from Monroe’s awakening at the Bureau of Study Counsel.
MNW: It’s a dead ringer for Monroe’s awakening. Barfield reasoned that to tackle this dual problem of racism and its invisibility, first you had to understand the issues, and then convince those in power — almost entirely older white men — that the problem needed their attention. The committee worked for over two years. They brought in outside experts who studied race relations, had several open community dialogues, and spent several months developing a 251-question survey with variations for white and nonwhite students.
Barfield: We wanted to try to get as deep an understanding of the experience, you know, of all the students really. So that we could kind of understand, compare and contrast
MNW: They asked questions like, rate from one to five how much you agree with the statement “Minority students are stereotyped by white students as all being generally the same” or yes/no, “do you think that you are treated differently because you are a minority by nonminority students? Or faculty?” and so on. They got 1300 responses, and the data analysis alone took almost a year. It was a mammoth effort, for a mammoth cause.
OGO: So there were 16 people on the committee. Other than Barfield and Epps, who else?
MNW: They tried to represent as many perspectives as possible. There were, using the report’s categories, 3 Black, 2 white, 3 hispanic, 1 asian american, and one Native American student. I spoke with Adela Cepeda, class of 1980, who asked to be on because she felt there were not enough Latinx voices.
Cepeda: Frankly, I wasn't originally included. There was no, as far as I can recall, there was not a Latino voice there. And when they came out with the announcement about it, I felt like we should be a part of this. And I went to see Dean Epps saying that, you know, I, I believed in the importance of this, and I wanted to be a part of it. They had already picked the group. So he asked me if I could be the secretary for the, for the committee. And I accepted, because I would be present at all the meetings and I could participate.
OGO: The fact that she had to be their secretary in order to contribute — that’s absurd. It’s like she had to pay them with this very gendered labor in order to have her voice heard — she’s doing them a favor. You’d think they would have paid her.
MNW: And in the end, only an additional two Latinx students participated. Part of this also is that Asian Americans were 4% of harvard, Latin Americans 3%, and Indigenous people 0.3%. So representation was a problem writ-large, not just for the committee. I also spoke with Jake Liang, class of 1980, who was a leader in the Asian American Association at the time. Dean Epps brought him on as an Asian American voice. Liang said he didn’t feel like a key voice in the group because in the context of the Civil Rights Movement, the issue of race relations was more relevant to the Black community
Jake Liang: at least the Asian American community were not the driving force behind this, but we were very happy to be involved and you know, pleased that they did involve us [...] we kind of felt we were just sort of there to weigh in, contribute, but we didn't really have any more problem that we faced that we wanted addressed for our community
MNW: It’s important to note, of course, that at the same time that Jake did not perceive acute anti-Asian racism, there’s someone like Florence, also a leader in Harvard’s Asian American community, at the exact same time, but she was hyper aware of racism and super active in the Third World liberation front, a pretty radical movement.
Houn: when I thought back to 40 years ago, and I saw all the demonstrations, you know, across the nation for Black Lives Matter, social justice, ending police brutality. It was the same kind of feeling of people wanting things to be better working together, and very diverse people.
MNW: So you have Jake being asked to represent the perspective of all Asian Americans at Harvard, but the difference between his and Flo’s politics shows he couldn’t do that — nobody could, just as no one or three people could represent all Hispanic or Black or Indigenous students. Each group contains diverse ethnicities, beliefs, class backgrounds, life experiences. So asking individuals to stand in for constructed demographics seems a little absurd. Not only is Asian or Hispanic super diverse, but they actually lumped hispanic and native american students together and provided no explanation. There were only 7 Native American respondents, so any statistical analyses there may not have been useful. It all makes me wonder when race-based statistical categories are or aren’t meaningful, especially when you start trying to apply them to qualitative questions, like Barfield wanted the committee to do.
OGO: I mean, of course the committee couldn’t represent every single perspective. And it seems like these students were tokenized, to some extent. But we could be more charitable — how else were they supposed to construct the committee? How else were they to efficiently collect data? It seems like including these students using those categories was well-intentioned, if not perfectly executed — like, in doing the first study of race relations, they at least tried to have as diverse a set of voices at the table as possible.
MNW: And that might be more generally indicative of this 1980 study — well-intentioned but sometimes falling short. Today we’d say you can’t understand race relations without digging into gender, class, and so many more factors. We might say statistical analyses like this one, and its categories, are imperfect, and that the qualitative community conversations and statistical survey data, which the 1980 study kept almost totally separate, need to be better integrated. But the committee worked with what they had. Each member was talented and committed. One of their two expert consultants, Thomas Pettigrew, a professor of race relations, remembered very little, but his general impression of the committee stood out strongly:
Thomas Pettigrew: I found them well-meaning, but incredibly naive. they were all great in their specialties, whatever it was, but they were quite naive about American race relations
Segment 3
OGO: So two years, many voices, many conversations, 1300 survey responses later. What came of all this?
MNW: I asked Barfield exactly that question — what were the results? What stood out?
Barfield: No, I can't say any, any surprises [...] I was a tutor, you know, I'd be, I was interacting with undergraduates all the time. You know, and so it's, you know, and and therefore I had a very clear understanding of maybe where they were coming from
OGO: Two years and nothing? What was this “it” that didn’t surprise him?
MNW: Well, the final report had a lot of findings, but most are obvious — they did an in-depth statistical analysis, cross-referencing eight metrics to prove that racism was not caused by one group of really racist people, but institutional. They found white students were less likely to perceive racism than nonwhite students. Etcetera.
OGO: I guess that goes back to the “novelty” that Barfield mentioned, that these obvious results were still important because many had never thought about these issues before.
MNW: Definitely. But for us, what might be interesting are findings on student attitudes about affirmative action. The Court had just ruled in 1978 in the landmark California v. Bakke case against racial quotas but approved using race in holistic admissions, explicitly praising Harvard’s process.
Barfield: you had affirmative action issues being raised. Bakke was settled in 78, as well. So it was an interesting time. And so, the whole issue of questioning, was very present at the institution, was a really big deal. “You shouldn't be there, do you belong?” you know, and affirmative action policies, or the specter of it, or how people thought of it — really, really kind of created a challenge in terms of being welcomed into the community and questioned about your right to belong. So a common experience that many undergraduates had would be people asking them, What was their SAT score?
MNW: So the committee was probing this question of, do affirmative action policies create doubts about the academic abilities of nonwhite students? In Barfield’s experience the answer was yes, and the report confirmed it — about two-thirds of Black, Hispanic, and Native American respondents thought such doubts existed in general.
OGO: That’s a huge condemnation of Harvard’s atmosphere at the time — that so many students of color perceived that kind of terrible, untrue stigma. Unfortunately, this diversity-meritocracy binary is something we hear to this day.
MNW: It’s this terrible double bind because first defenders of affirmative action have to combat this false binary in the fight against Ed Blum and Students for Fair Admissions’ lawsuit, which alleges affirmative action at Harvard benefits Black and other minorities while discriminating against Asian American applicants. The suit has been criticized for attacking Black and brown students and pitting minorities against one another. Here’s a clip from a 2018 rally critical of Blum and SFFA
Defend Diversity Rally: Blum wants to divide us to achieve his end game goal, which is to limit opportunity and to whitewash history and systemic institutionalized racism. And by doing so, he is harming white students, all students, by ignoring the benefits that students glean from a diverse learning environment.
MNW: And then, even if affirmative action is defended in the legal arena, students of color continue to suffer from others having unfounded doubts about their academic abilities, as was expressed in the I, too, am Harvard campaign
Jazmyne Reid in “I, too, am harvard”: when they start having these affirmative action debates, I’m like, you are coming for my life! I am not a policy, I am not a relief method, I am me. And only I know how hard I worked to get here [applause]
OGO: And all these doubts and microaggressions students still face show that letting more diverse people in doesn’t mean you’re doing a good job welcoming them, hence all these doubts about self-belonging. Who is in the University doesn’t change what the University is, if that makes sense. Which is also similar to a lot of students’ reactions to the current Students for Fair Admissions lawsuit. A lot of our classmates at once support affirmative action — they want more students of color — but are critical of how Harvard fails to welcome or support these students of color and might have very image-focused intentions in bringing them to campus.
Defend diversity rally: We know we belong here. We know we are worthy of this space. And we know that every time we walk across this campus, we are doing work for this school.
OGO: I guess the follow-up question about the report’s findings in 1980 is, did these perceptions cause nonwhite students to oppose affirmative action?
MNW: Not at all. Minority, and especially Black, students were way more likely than whites to support special considerations for minorities in admissions to make up for historical inequity. Large majorities of white students agreed diversity was good, but at the same time nearly 60% of white students rejected quotas in admissions. Meanwhile, 83% of Black respondents agreed that minorities should receive special consideration to ensure higher than proportional representation compared to the general US population.
OGO: I know I just said numerical diversity isn’t the same as actual diversity, but that adamant support for aggressive affirmative action reminds me just how few minorities there were then. Like, the struggle for diversity is still really important, but it may have seemed even more pressing then. Recruitment was a huge issue, going to marginalized communities and just getting people in the door. We talked John Anthony Butler, class of 1980, for instance, who was a leader in the Black Students Association and a dedicated activist,
John A. Butler: Most of my time was conscious about, okay, how do we continue to grow our pipeline and grow the potential numbers of people who are at Harvard. So affirmative action was an issue, I mean, I did in 1978, you know, with another schoolmate, upperclassman and me, we went, we’d go to Washington, DC to participate in so called, you know, demonstrations in front of the Supreme Court, to to, to challenge the so-called Bakke decision
OGO: Which is crazy because today progressives are fighting to save Bakke and considering race at all in admissions, and back then he was opposing it because Bakke, which allowed the use of race in holistic admissions but overturned race-based admissions quotas, wasn’t progressive enough. The very possibility is out of the question today. And, of course, race-based admissions were in Black-and-white terms then.
MNW: Whereas now, Asian Americans are the face of the harvard affirmative action lawsuit. It’s pretty fascinating to look at the report’s findings with regards to Asian students — they don’t differentiate American and international students. You’re right that the report is in a Black-white binary in part because that was the central issue a decade after the civil rights movement and the summer of 68, and in part because numerically they just couldn’t say much about non-Black minorities. But what they do say about Asian Americans is pretty fascinating. Part of their final conclusions is that, to quote, “most Asians had perceptions similar to those of white students, in that they were fairly satisfied and secure, saw relatively little prejudice, believed that present admissions and financial aid policies were fair.” And this is a statement born out in their statistics: most Asian american respondents opposed quotas, were less likely to perceive racism at Harvard, were less likely to join protests than other nonwhite students, and so on. The report is peppered with these statements placing Asians as nearly white in their attitudes, as not having a lot of racial grievances, kind of similar to what Jake was expressing:
Liang: I think what the contribution would be, really for us to, to really, try to showcase that, that we as an Asian American community, being brought into the Harvard community, have contributed substantially to various different aspects. And, you know, again that was all under the sort of the premise of a sort of model minority because that's kind of what was said then, and none of this really kind of bucked the trend substantially, because we didn't really know any better.
OGO: I’ve heard the term before — the model minority — but could we get a reminder about what he’s referring to?
MNW: The model minority is a stereotype about Asian Americans that basically says Asian Americans are the most successful minority group because they work hard, don’t complain, and can adopt American values. It’s an immigrant bootstraps narrative saying Asian Americans have “earned” their place in the meritocracy.
OGO: Jake sounded almost guilty for acting under, “the premise of a sort of model minority”
MNW: He did, and he kept expressing similar remorse throughout our interview. I think that’s because the model minority stereotype is a myth — basically new immigration laws in 1965 led to an influx of skilled immigrants from Asia who the U.S. then claimed as evidence of succeeding within America, even though they had all been educated in their country of origin — and that myth was weaponized to racist ends to attack the civil rights movement by arguing if Asian Americans have succeeded as model minorities, then Black people are “problem” minorities.
OGO: It seems like for Jake, that as a student he attempted to prove that Asian Americans contributed positively to Harvard was like trying to prove how Asians contributed to and deserved their place in the US, which in retrospect maybe inadvertently propped up a model minority stereotype that has racist consequences.
MNW: Right. And the model minority myth also obscures that, and this is kind of obvious now, Asia is big and diverse, and a lot of Asian immigrants who aren’t from this educated class in their home country struggle in the U.S. But this is also complicated because we also have to recognize the ways in which, consciously and unconsciously, Asian Americans do benefit and sometimes buy into this myth, and even its harmful consequences of reinforcing hierarchies. A lot of Asian Americans support Blum’s lawsuit, for instance. This is a massively complex issue we could do an entire podcast on, and I’ll leave some links in the episode notes if anybody’s interested.
OGO: To bring us back to the 1980 report, it seems like what we’re seeing is how the Black-white framework of the committee, which was in many ways necessary because of sample size limitations and because the most pressing issues were Black-and-white, also created a very narrow understanding of race relations.
MNW: And we see that narrow view come up again in the report’s other key set of findings. The committee’s probing of attitudes toward affirmative action had to do with getting people in the door and how people valued diversity. So the obvious next set of questions was, what do and should diversity look like at Harvard? Th committee wanted to examine the quantity and quality of interracial interaction — once again interracial defined mostly as white and Black. The really big issue, at the time, was whether minorities self-segregate. Today that takes the form of rhetoric around the so-called Black Table.
Rodriguez Roberts in “I, Too, Am Harvard”: So I sat at the Black table in Annenberg...
MNW: That’s a clip from the 2014 “I, Too, Am Harvard” campaign. It’s a contentious issue to this day and there’s a huge spectrum of opinions, which I think reflects the huge spectrum of opinions on what “healthy race relations,” quote-unquote, look like.
OGO: Well, there was Monroe’s view, that Harvard was so strange and hostile he had little choice but to spend more time with other Black students that he felt most comfortable being himself around.
MNW: And to that end, in the 1980 report, 73% of Black students thought white students had not put equal effort into positive race relations, nearly double the number of white students who agreed with that statement. A majority of white students agreed that minorities tend to isolate themselves, whereas a majority of Black students disagreed with that. I could keep listing numbers, but the gist is, white students blamed minorities for self-segregating, while minorities thought “racial separatism” was a response to racism and lack of inclusivity on the part of a white institution.
Florence Houn: There were certain houses that, oh, you know that's, that's where African American students go. You know, that's where the preppies go, that's where the jocks go. I mean, so it's not just people of color factions, there are all these other factions, like finals clubs, like, that's where we don't go.
MNW: And we hear echoes of that in the 21st century, for instance in the I, Too, Am Harvard play:
Roberts: ... I think white people for the most part are scared of entering groups of all nonwhite people, but there’s no such thing as me being scared of entering a group of white people, because that’s the world
OGO: I was just thinking, if everyone on men’s heavyweight crew wore a neon yellow suit, you’d have a “men’s crew table” that would probably be bigger and more consistent than a “Black table.” But it’s fine for men’s crew to be super exclusive and tight-knit. There’s almost this expectation that Black or nonwhite students should single-handedly integrate the community, which is absurd given you could argue the segregation is happening the other way around.
Roberts: It’s freshman year, and that’s where my friends were sitting. It’s not like we were making a conscious discriminatory action, like I’m going to ignore white people at all costs this meal. Because for me at least, sitting with all Black people at the table is like coming home from a day at work. You don’t have to explain yourself
MNW: The term “integration” generally, I think, can put the burden on nonwhite students to make themselves palatable to a very white, very elite culture. Shouldn’t the onus be on the with, on Harvard to shift its core values to align with the needs and perspectives of students from disadvantaged backgrounds? Both Cepeda and Houn had a lot to say on supposed self segregating
Cepeda: When you think about it, you know, the class is 1600 students, right? And so what percent was Black? You know, 10%, something like that? Yeah. So that's 160 students. So really, if six or seven students are together, I mean, to me, that issue being raised really reflects that group, which is the other 1500 or 1400 students, they’re the ones that are together and segregating. We're trying not to be tokens. That's the reality. Because it's very uncomfortable to be a token, I remember we had a lot of conversations about this and achieving critical mass so that, so that it wouldn't seem segregated. It's very hard to achieve when you're such a small percentage of the total population
Houn: I just think that it's fine to have a chess club and a republican club and a democratic club, as well as, you know, an Asian women's organization. I think what we're all trying to do, whether it's our enjoyment of chess or advancing chess playing, or advancing Asian American women's confidence and knowledge and ability to mentor and learn more from each other.
MNW: There’s also this broader question of, what is integration? This gets back to the inadequacy of the very generalizing demographic categories and overall Black-and-white model not only of this report, but that we often use to discuss race in this country in general. Students like Cepeda, who is Colombian, were very aware of this shortcoming
Adela Cepeda: At the time, Harvard only characterized Chicano Mexican American students, they're called Chicano students, as minority Latino. people like me that were, Caribbean Latinos, I'm from Colombia, and, and I don't even know if they included Puerto Rican students in that category, maybe they did. The point was, when they had the orientation sessions for Hispanic students, I was not, I was not included in that. And I had to make my own way to students from that, those backgrounds, where I naturally fit. I mean, I spoke Spanish and our cultures are very similar. So I felt that the University didn't know how to even categorize us, at least on the Latino side. But there was a very nice network of Mexican American students, including my roommates. And I was very much a part of that. I came from a neighborhood in Long Island that was very mixed Black and Latino. And so I, you know, I was very glad to be a part of Black socializing events, or Black social events like that.
OGO: So diversity and multiculturalism, to use those awful words, take personal interactions and effort and people and, well, casting aside statistical categories. Speaking of statistics, was the committee able to quantify whether racial separatism actually existed?
MNW: The data varies, but the majority of students had had both white and nonwhite roommates, and most reported having the same number of white and nonwhite friends. I will say, the data’s self-reported, Harvard’s skewed demographics skew the data, and the report is limited to generic, white-nonwhite interactions, so it doesn’t tell us about what Florence or Adela described, all of the cross-cultural interactions within the nonwhite umbrella. It’s like interracial interaction is defined as expanding white people’s worldview, spicing up a bland white space. For me what stands out in these numbers is that a substantial proportion of students of color — 40% of Black students and one-third of Hispanic and Native American Students — said their perceptions of white people got worse after four years. Which makes sense given the cover of the Lampoon in 1977 or the Crimson in 1980.
OGO: I don’t mean to continue our tirade against statistics. But the report seems inconclusive on separatism, as you might expect. It tells us that there were interracial interactions, but people are also more comfortable around those they identify with. And that white people are less aware of their own racism. For some minorities, spending time at a PWI — a predominantly white institution — that doesn’t make much effort to include you, makes you cynical about said PWI and white people more generally. None of this is revelatory, which is exactly what Barfield said — as a tutor who interacted with undergrads all the time, none of the findings surprised him.
MNW: Right, which begs the question, why do all this?
Segment 4
MNW: The phrase that stuck out to me, talking to Barfield, was when he referred to the report as a “communication piece.”
Barfield: I think that the challenge really was representing it in a way that, you know, this had to be a communications piece that could work. And, and that was where we spent a tremendous amount of time working with Archie to kind of come up with the recommendations, how they were stated. And, and the idea was just to move the ball down the field, you know, nothing earth shattering, but at least to make the community more aware, and that it's something that could be worked on and can be managed
OGO: It’s like they went through the motions of this massive fact-finding effort, but it was all just to prove a point, not to really learn? I guess without statistical groups, it’s hard to make a claim to administrators, to make your knowledge seem valid. So students’ knowledge about racism and segregation at Harvard, which Monroe had publicized many years earlier, that’s not deemed legitimate. The report on the other hand, in the language of sociology and stats, might have been? But also Barfield said they did really want to learn about this problem in detail. So it’s a little bit of both.
MNW: Yeah, I mean the way I understand it is, the report confirmed everything that a Black person, like Barfield, already knew about Harvard, and added granular detail. But it spoke in an official language, that of science. Better than testimony and feelings.
OGO: That’s sarcasm, listener!
MNW: Yes, obviously.
OGO: So if this report was a communications document, what, in their conclusions, did it communicate? What did they recommend?
MNW: Nothing that surprising. They voice strong support for affirmative action, diverse faculty hiring, modifying language in the student handbook, making a more supportive environment for minorities, things like that in very general terms. I talked to William Mayer ’80, the Gov. concentrator brought on to do the statistical analysis, and he wasn’t sure the recommendations even had any relationship to the survey data.
William Mayer: people decide to do surveys, because they think it seems intellectually respectable. But it's not clear what they actually learn from these things that's helpful to what they're trying to do. And I, to some extent, felt that way about this particular survey. It wasn't clear to me what all you learn from it that that had any relationship to the the recommendations of the of the, of the Commission
MNW: I will say, one maybe unexpected recommendation was to add a course on race relations to the core curriculum.
OGO: Woah! That would be considered almost radical even today. Quantitative Reasoning with Data, Civics and Ethics, Aesthetics and Culture, and Race Relations. What would such a course look like?
MNW: Well, the 1980 report recommended the course not be required but just strongly recommended, and that the course would aim to help students understand and think about racial issues. Nothing more substantive than that.
OGO: So, then, were the communications successful?
MNW: Well, they definitely generated a lot of buzz.
Barfield: You know, it got good newspaper coverage, in the Times and the Post.
MNW: Mostly the articles covered that there are problems at Harvard. Although, Peter Skerry of the conservative Commentary Magazine had a go at it, using the report to lambast affirmative action. But outside of that I don’t think it directly led to substantive changes. Harvard kept recruiting minorities, diversifying, things like that, but that was all happening anyway. And it was painfully slow, as we know to this day.
Barfield: stepping back and looking at it, I mean, there wasn't — I mean Derek Bok was the president at the time and, and Rosovsky didn't look at the report, really. It was, you know, he claims he had the chance to look at it. I can't say there was real top down leadership.
MNW: Henry Rosovsky was Dean of FAS at the time. He did not respond to requests for comment. But also, Barfield left Harvard for California, so he’s not totally sure what came of it. It is worth noting that Bok read the report and discussed race relations at length in his commencement speech that year, in which he likely was referencing this report. Mayer recalls,
Mayer: I believe the next year after this report came out, he delivered a talk about that report. So he clearly read it took it seriously
MNW: Bok would go on to mention race relations in open letters to Harvard and support the creation of the Foundation on Intercultural Relations in 1981. So we can’t say if the report by itself pushed Harvard leadership to take race relations seriously, but there was some effect, for sure.
OGO: Can we say anything more specific than that? Actually, looking at these recommendations in the report, they’re so vague I don’t know if we could quantify progress or implementation…
MNW: I struggled with that, too. Some of the recommendations are just, promote racial integration, or keep hiring faculty of color. And those happened, but it’s impossible to say if it was the result of this report.
Mayer: if you were an academic, I think it provided some interesting data. I just wasn't sure to what extent it actually helped improve race relations on campus
OGO: Well, we know there was no race relations requirement added. Scanning the list, many of the other recommendations were more studies, and none of those happened, or if they did they aren’t public. The only thing that directly happened, it seems, was adding language explaining a new procedure for reporting discrimination in the student handbook. Which is funny because 40 years later a lot of people have complained about Harvard lacking racial grievance procedures.
Houn: I do recall the report coming out, and I think the feeling was that nothing was going to happen, other than the issue was going to be Harvardized, meaning making it an academic, an academic topic or issue that could be further studied and discussed
OGO: I love that verb — to “Harvardize” an issue, to designate it for further study. It seems to describe some of what’s been going on recently, too, especially with the PULSE survey. Although, this 1980 report strikes me as quite different from PULSE.
MNW: Yeah, do you want to tell me more about those differences?
OGO: Well, PULSE was this 10-question online survey they asked undergrads, graduate students, staff, and faculty to fill out a couple of years ago. Respondents were asked to fill out to what extent they agreed with statements like, “I feel like I belong at Harvard” or “I believe Harvard leadership will take appropriate action in response to incidents of harassment and discrimination.” Then they broke down the answers by race, gender, political ideology, and so on.
MNW: Compared to a 251-question survey, it feels a little skimpy. I actually asked Barfield about the PULSE survey, since educational assessment with stats is his job.
Barfield: It's worth only three minutes worth of anybody's time, as far as I'm concerned, you know. The rankings of each group would be exactly what I would expect to see,
OGO: That’s, well, direct. But yeah — you see much lower numbers of belonging among Black and Middle Eastern students relative to white student, among gender nonconforming than cis people, among Muslim students compared to any other religion. Which is all good to quantify, except we kind of knew this already — it’s not that surprising. And so I agree in the sense that it’s hard to see how such a general survey can really quote “help inform priorities, practices, and policies in the months and years to come,” as Harvard wrote in its announcement.
MNW: Barfield basically thought PULSE was paltry compared to his study. The 1980 report had hyper-specific questions and scenarios. Instead of ‘do you feel like you belong,’ they asked specifically about belonging in terms of political beliefs, social class, educational background, career goals, and more. They differentiated about perceptions of faculty, staff, other students, TFs, and so on. A Harvard spokesperson declined to comment on the PULSE survey.
OGO: Maybe there’s a more generous view of Pulse? I’m thinking of how both Barfield and Mayer said the 1980 report, even though it was thorough in its analysis, didn’t arrive at anything novel and the super specific statistics weren’t really used to make any recommendations. But Barfield seemed okay with that shortcoming because the report raised awareness and was a, what he called, a communications document. Maybe PULSE is also a communications document?
MNW: That’s the only way Barfield was able to rationalize it.
Barfield: I think that, overall, it's, it's inclusive enough to make people, to help people understand that they are part of a larger effort. And I think that if I were strategizing, that's the way I would approach it, and, you know, begin there.
OGO: The only thing is, it’s not the beginning! It’s like the third report in a chain that started in 2014 — which we’ll talk about in another episode. But my point being, what is pulse communicating that hasn’t already been communicated?
MNW: Well, Barfield had a somewhat interesting take on that — while we’re pointing out that these diversity reviews repeat themselves, he sees that repetition as necessary and a sign of renewed commitment to helping people of color. And we might note that the 1980 study claimed not to be a response to anything, but it kind of reacted to that Lampoon cartoon and was led by students and administrators already concerned with race relations. Whereas PULSE came top-down from the highest echelons of Harvard leadership and the labor did not fall primarily on students of color. So even if Pulse seemed less than effective to Barfield, it also heartened him.
Barfield: I do believe in committees repeating themselves, because we don't solve the problem in one year, we don't solve the problem in two years, you know. So there needs to be a continued commitment to trying to solve the problem. I can define the committee work like that [...] the next step really is turning the corner to action. And as long as the initiative has actionable components, then then you have some accountability, then you have something to measure in terms of a change. And, and so yeah, you do need an evaluation, you will have the initiative because the initiative without an evaluation without clear markers towards progress is, you know, navel gazing, right? You don't want to have people just kind of meet to meet. But, but again, I really do believe that if they're not meeting, then it goes away.
OGO: Huh, okay. In some ways that’s even more troubling, because if the reports are supposed to keep the university accountable for improving, but the university neglects the reports that already exist, i.e. the 1980 study not being mentioned in the pulse survey, then we just spend all our time fact-finding and don’t turn the corner.
OGO: I will note that the meaning of diversity and belonging are quite different today than in 1980. That report focused only on race, and only among undergrads. PULSE surveys a lot of identity categories, among students, faculty, and staff. So they are different — it’s not a lie to say PULSE is the first of its kind.
MNW: Yeah, but I don’t know if it’s the truth, either. Clearly, in 1980, a group of well-meaning Harvard community members came together to understand race relations at the College. They found that Black and other minority students perceive the problem, but white students often don’t. They found that minorities perceive much more prejudice. They found mistrust in administration to deal with instances of discrimination. PULSE repeated all of those findings. Maybe if the 1980 report hadn’t been forgotten, we’d be looking at some very different statistics right now.
Houn: for me to say something 40 years old, that is resonant today shows you the amount of progress that has been made. Because, you know, I was very — when that report came out, I knew I was ready to leave Harvard, and I did not want to improve the lives of people at Harvard. That was not a goal in life, because it was not going to achieve anything concrete.
Segment 5
MNW: So we leave off asking ourselves, why does so much repeat itself at Harvard, why is there so much institutional amnesia — especially around the ubiquitous diversity review? Not to be glib, but this has all happened before, and…
OGO: Wait, wait. Think about this: In 1979, 15% of Harvard College was nonwhite. Now, the majority of the College is nonwhite. In 1979, financial aid was tiny. Since 2004, Harvard has guaranteed no student loans. There have been changes, dare I say improvements.
MNW: Okay, but affirmative action debates rage on, they had apartheid divestment and we have prisons, racist incidents still happen, it seems, every few months.
OGO: Right, I’m just saying the context is super different for these events, and in some ways so is the response. Let’s not dehistoricize. We looked at one of the first Harvard diversity reviews. We compared it to the PULSE survey from the present. But we need to go even bigger — PULSE was a recommendation from the 2018 Presidential Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging, a major effort, much bigger than the 1980 study, whose report has led Harvard’s policy on diversity and inclusion for the past 3 years. Next time, on Under Review…
Frances Frei: If they are used, because we're like, really time sensitive and because we want to, like learn from diverse perspectives, great. task forces that are, oh, we have a problem, let's put a taskforce and, lets just postpone the problem for like a year or two years.
Dorothy Villarreal: We were very weary of making big changes, because Harvard is a big lumbering institution, where, you know, one small flutter of a butterfly wing really can create a whole Cyclone
Daryl Smith: Too many reports will say things like we urge deans and department chairs. We are long past the urging. People are too busy. If this is optional, we’ve got too much on our plate.

About Under Review:
How can Harvard, an institution with so much history, have so little memory?
The racial reckonings and Black Lives Matter protests that swept the country this past summer brought attention to a trend in how Harvard seems to deal with student activism and concerns surrounding race, racism, and diversity: to commission a diversity review. These committees and reports long predate this summer, and reading them it can seem, at times, like some things have not changed at the University — in race relations, Harvard’s review process, or the findings and recommendations. What can these diversity reviews accomplish, and what can’t they?
“Under Review” is a podcast from The Harvard Crimson, hosted by Matteo Wong and Olivia Oldham, chairs of The Crimson’s weekly magazine, Fifteen Minutes. Each week, they will explore controversies and diversity reviews stretching across 40 years of Harvard history, speaking to dozens of students, activists, experts, and more, to try and understand how the Harvard diversity review works — or doesn’t.
“Under Review” is produced by Zing Gee and Thomas Maisonneuve. Music by Ian Chan. Art by Meera S. Nair.

In Episode 3 of Under Review, hosts Matteo Wong and Olivia Oldham try to understand what makes a diversity review successful — and what, exactly, defines success — by looking at the most important diversity review at Harvard from recent years. Listen and subscribe on Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts.
OGO: Previously, on Under Review
Sylvester Monroe: the traditional Harvard just isn't my Harvard, the Harvard of my experience has been three years of a totally Black existence.
Donald Barfield: we wanted to try to get as deep an understanding of the experience, you know, of all the students really, so that we could kind of understand
Florence Houn: I do recall the report coming out, and I think the feeling was that nothing was going to happen, other than the issue was going to be Harvardized, meaning making it an academic, an academic topic or issue that could be further studied and discussed and discoursed about
Donald Barfield: It's worth only three minutes worth of anybody's time, as far as I'm concerned, you know. The rankings of each group would be exactly what I would expect to see
Hilda M. Jordan: as the world is realizing the long history of police brutality that has plagued the United States and particularly the Black community in the US, right. We're fighting it right on this campus that's supposed to be the beacon of privilege and elitism
President Lawrence s. Bacow: “Here in Harvard Yard, we must embrace diversity in every possible dimension”
OGO: It should come as little surprise that Harvard, one of the world’s leading research institutions, approaches problems within its walls by researching them. For concerns over racism and inclusion, that means further study through a diversity review.
clip of MNW and OGO reading review names
MNW: In our first two episodes, we looked in-depth at some specific diversity reviews, from 1980 ranging all the way to the past few years. But how, exactly, do these reviews fit together — in Harvard’s vision, in the eyes of students, or just as documents? Are Harvard’s diversity efforts typical of a university or similar institutions? How do they compare to diversity reviews at corporations? Staring at all these documents and events made us feel, sometimes, like we were trying to solve a jigsaw puzzle with no reference image and missing pieces. But during our reporting, as we looked for corner and edge pieces, we kept getting pointed back to one particular, and particularly consequential, review:
OGO: The Presidential Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging — a two-year committee of more than 60 members, chaired by Professors Danielle Allen and Archon Fung, complete with community conversations, discussions, and workshops. And its final product, released in March of 2018: a high-production, 82-page report, with carefully designed pages — including a consistent color palette of primary colors — Black and white photos of impassioned professors speaking at workshops, and standard brochure shots of students, staff, and faculty laughing or deep in conversation with one another.
OGO: Former University President Drew Faust, in September 2016, gave the task force the massive charge of answering “questions about institutional values and goals for what we can contribute to and learn from one another to advance the work of inclusive excellence.” The Task Force was implemented to explore these questions on a University-wide scale. It would include college students, graduate students, professors, administrators, custodial workers, tech support, and staff on every level. And, in the years sense, the task force has been the core, guiding framework for the University on a wide range of diversity and inclusion efforts.
OGO: I’m Olivia Oldham,
MNW: and I’m Matteo Wong. You’re listening to Under Review, a podcast from the Harvard Crimson’s magazine, Fifteen Minutes, in which we’re exploring what we call the Harvard diversity review. This week, we’re exploring one of the largest diversity reviews Harvard has ever undertaken, and the review currently driving much of Harvard’s policies on race and inclusion: The Presidential Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging. What did it achieve? Who has it helped — and who has it neglected?

Christopher Hopson: So there was a, there's a bus that came to pick up, those of us who were in Harvard Square, and we went there. And, you know, it was a, it was like a big conference room, there were a lot of, you know, big round tables, and everyone's sitting around. And I think if I remember correctly, there were three undergrads on the entire Task Force.
OGO: Christopher Hopson was a sophomore when he joined the Presidential Task Force — one of very few undergraduates, though it was actually seven, not three. Professor Danielle Allen had personally asked him to join; Hopson was the co-chair of Inclusion and Belonging for the Black Students Association, so he already had some interest in the issues the Task Force was dealing with. Hopson went to several of the Task Force discussion sessions.
Hopson: They distributed us at tables with, you know, staff, faculty. So each little each little table was, was a diverse group of folks from different parts of the university. [...] They put a couple of questions to the room and then said, you know, can you discuss these in your table groups? And, I mean, I remember like, just, some of them were about, you know, what have been your experiences with inclusion and belonging on campus? What are things that you've heard your peers, and your colleagues talk about regarding these issues?
OGO: These questions were just the tip of the iceberg. The Task Force set their research around four main areas: one, to understand the quote-unquote ‘demographic realities’ at Harvard — in other words, representation and diversity in numbers. Two, to explore the varying, day-to-day experiences of inclusion or exclusion of members of Harvard’s community. Three, ‘academic resources’: things like course offerings and other ways of learning about or researching ‘diversity’. And four, Harvard’s organizational structures, from the office of diversity and inclusion, to its various deans, to its students organizations, and how they can better work together.
MNW: A tall order. How could one group of people, no matter how large and with how much expertise, produce comprehensive and specific findings in all of those areas?
OGO: To their credit, the co-chairs had a clear and methodical way of going about their work. Over the course of a year and four months, the whole Task Force met eleven times. The co-chairs met weekly; the subcommittees, monthly. They held 16 workshops across the University. If the Task Force was anything, it was meticulous. We reached out to around 15 of the professors and faculty on the task force, but only one person agreed be to interviewed
MNW: In comparison, the 1980 study of race relations — a group of students and administrators tasked by then-Dean of Students Archie Epps to study and find ways to improve the experiences of nonwhite students at Harvard, which we dove into last episode — sound almost amateur. They brought on a couple of professors as experts, but undergrads and graduate students led the charge. I mean, they had a gov concentrator do the statistical analysis. How did such a meticulous, methodical diversity review as the Presidential Task Force come to be?
OGO: In Faust’s charge, she vaguely wrote that “recent events both here and elsewhere have reminded us” that Harvard is far from where it wants to be on diversity. One thing the report says is that diversity in education lags behind the ‘corporate world’, and that Harvard needs to catch up. In another part of the report, it references “I, Too, Am Harvard,” a campaign led by mostly Black students in 2014 to amplify their experiences of Harvard, which often included exclusion and racism.
MNW: Right, we mentioned this in the last episode. The campaign seems to really have set the background for a lot of conversations about race in the past seven years. Kimiko Matsuda-Lawrence, an undergraduate at the time, interviewed about 40 Black students about their experiences at Harvard. She and other students turned those into a play and social media campaign that gained national attention for shedding light on the marginalization and prejudice Black undergrads face on this campus. And, I’ll add, the title “I, Too, Am Harvard” is likely a reference to a protest put on by Black students in 2007 called “I Am Harvard.”
“I, Too, Am Harvard” canon
OGO: And, let’s not forget, Faust conceived of the Task Force in May 2016, just as Donald Trump began to gain traction in his bid for the White House.
MNW: So there were many different events pushing toward this diversity review. In some ways it’s the same as Epps in 1977, who wrote that no specific incident triggered the race relations report, even though we could kind of point to the racist Lampoon cover. But again, it’s difficult to compare the two — in 1980, thinking about race and racism was “novel” to Harvard’s white super-majority, but in 2016 those issues were front and center for all.
OGO: I will say that, like that Lampoon graphic, the “I, Too, Am Harvard” campaign seems especially important here. It actually prompted an earlier review committee in 2015 called the Harvard College Working Group on Diversity and Inclusion.
MNW: And, let me guess, that 2015 College Working Group was the direct cause for the presidential task force?
OGO: Yep. In their final report, the 2015 Working Group called for a University-wide Task Force, to address issues beyond their purview. The Working Group was by and for the college, not the University. But nonetheless a lot of the questions in the Working Group’s report came up again in the 2018 Presidential Task Force. Dorothy Villarreal was a student on the Collge Working Group.
Dorothy Villarreal: My name is Dorothy Villarreal. I am from Rio Grande Valley, Texas. And I went to Harvard and graduated in 2015.
OGO: Dorothy was asked in part to participate in the working group because of her experience leading Concilio Latino, one of the largest Latinx orgs on campus.
Dorothy: Our meetings were at 8am, on Friday, every week. Like from my junior year to my senior year. I'm a morning person, but you know, you had to trudge through the snow and like, you had to, like, you had to really be sure about your time and, you know, like, my Fridays weren't necessarily like an off day, like a lot of people had. But for me, you know, that kind of stuff didn't matter, because it felt like we were doing something really important.
OGO: Dorothy also says the students were not paid for their time.
Dorothy: And I think like ’65 is when we first admitted like our first like, Latino, like cohort. And the feeling of change being a very recent thing at Harvard was, was very real for me. And so I wanted to kind of help be a part of that.
OGO: I remember Monroe, who wrote the essay “Guest in a Strange House” in 1973 about his experience as a Black student at Harvard, saying that
Monroe: Beginning in the mid 60s, Harvard and a steadily growing group of Black students began feeling their way through a totally new experience
OGO: And Dorothy is gesturing toward something similar for Latinx students, that the 1960s and 1970s were the beginnings of even their presence at Harvard. And in 2014, when she joined this working group, diversity was not at all new, but inclusivity was still very far from being ideal. So Dorothy, decades later, still felt the need to support and fight for herself and her peers when given the opportunity, and be a part of that legacy that began in the 60s.
Dorothy: And being in my community, I had a lot of friends that felt very despondent about being at Harvard, that felt like they were at a place that didn't like them, didn't care for them, that had only brought them here to teach, you know, like our counterparts how to talk with people like us, which is not a good way to feel, right. Like, you don't ever want to go into a place and feel like you're being used because of your identity, right, you want to feel like you're contributing something, and that you're getting something in return.
OGO: As we talked about, at Harvard in the 1980s — and earlier — a lot of students felt that their identities were being used to diversify the school, and then they were being forgotten about once they arrived. Dorothy saw the same sentiment among her peers, and she saw the Working Group as an opportunity to undo that.
Villarreal: And it's this, like, dream that I'd always had to go to this school that, you know, like, when I was younger, we didn't even like, my family and I are from Mexico. So I didn't even know that it was pronounced Harvard, I thought it was like, 'Harvard.' I just had no idea what to expect, right. And so I go from a school where, you know, I'm like, first gen low income. And then I go into this, like, magical place. And like, people, parents have yachts and like, are wearing, you know, $1,000 jackets, and I've never even seen, you know, $1,000 in my life.
MNW: Dorothy was using the task force as a platform to voice her experience, one that might otherwise go unheard. She seems to be striking, in some ways, a similar chord as Hilda, who led the protests after the police violence the night of Yardfest in 2018.
Jordan: feeling it with every fiber of my body and starting to cry because I truly felt like I was just crying to the institution to have them care for us.
MNW: Both put an immense amount of effort into improving this institution for minorities. Except, Hilda was much more reserved about the University — admin was “an asset we had to balance,” she said, because she was making her voice heard from the outside. Whereas Dorothy, it sounds like, was trying to make change from within, learning to use the language of power.
OGO: What’s interesting is that, no matter how the students tried to express their needs to the University — either through official channels or with with activism — their voices got funneled into review committees. Which brings us back to the question we’ve been asking: is this normal, review after review after review? And more importantly, does it work?
Segment 2
MNW: In order to better understand the various iterations of the Harvard diversity review, and this presidential task force in particular, we wanted to take a step back and ask some experts about diversity reviews and task forces more broadly. Maybe the most basic question here is, what is the purpose of a diversity review? Why would Harvard, or any university, or a company for that matter, launch one? We wanted to go behind the scenes, to try to explore the review from as close to the point of view of a university administrator as we could get.
Smith: My name is Daryl Smith and I'm a research fellow Senior Research Fellow and a professor emeritus at Claremont Graduate University […] my research has been on institutional change and diversity issues in higher education.
MNW: Smith studies and has conducted numerous diversity reviews for universities, and literally wrote the book on reviewing and improving diversity in higher education.
Smith : I think these reports give us an opportunity to, to honor where we've been, because we've clearly made progress. This, you know, 2021 higher education doesn't look like the 1960s. So we can mark progress, but then we can very carefully and articulately mark where we haven't made progress
OGO: So, as a basic definition, diversity reviews chart progress: whence we came, where we are at, where we should be going. But the deeper question underlying that is, progress toward what? What does it mean to make “progress” on diversity and inclusion?
MNW: That’s where Smith drew an almost radical analogy between diversity and technology:
Smith: In the early days of technology, what happened was institutions understood that the world was changing. And it was becoming more technological. And as campuses began to have those conversations, there were people who were very resistant to it. And there were faculty, I remember, they stood up in faculty meetings and said books would go away, libraries would close and higher education as we knew it would stop. Well, every campus I've been on, over the last number of years, has spent millions of dollars renovating their campuses. And as far as I can see it, books haven't gone away. But there was fear of change. But the notion was, it was an imperative. And we had to move. Now, what was important there, and I think an important lesson, even today, is there was recognition that capacity had to be built.
OGO: Her argument, in essence, seems to be that higher education rapidly adapted to new technologies because, if universities didn’t want to become obsolete, there was no alternative. And today technology is as core to higher ed as it is to the rest of the world — smart devices and software used for learning and teaching, devoting tremendous resources to research in computer science and engineering, online networks used for logistics and HR, big IT departments with an influential CTO, and so on.
MNW: Right, and Smith thinks universities should approach diversity similarly:
Smith: diversity is no longer a projection. It's no longer, do we want it or don't want it. Almost half of the young adult population in this country is already BIPOC. So the diversity issue, whether it's, for me the question is, for any institution, given their mission, why would this be an imperative? So for some campuses, it would be attractive from an enrollment point of view, if they're a traditional tuition generating institution. But for Harvard, any research university, it's preparing the future faculty, you know. We shouldn't have to — 10 years from now, I mean, that should be in everybody's job description. Daryl Smith should not be hired if I don't have competence in my field to engage ‘How does diversity play out?’
OGO: It strikes me as a very calculated way to think about diversity. She’s framing diversity as a means to accomplish the institution’s mission. Why can’t we have diversity for the sake of diversity? Isn’t combatting racism, sexism, and so on a worthy goal in and of itself?
MNW: Of course, it should be. But if all universities thought that way, there would be no reason for Smith to have written her book on diversity — or, for that matter, for this podcast. The reason Smith uses the technology analogy is because it’s an example of universities making rapid and dramatic change — whereas oftentimes, in her decades of experience helping universities with diversity and inclusion reviews, it seems higher education is very slow to make deep, institutional change on that front:
Smith: And I've been on many campuses where I could read the latest report and just change the date [...] I still see this today, that we've got diversity plans and unit plans. But they run parallel to the strategic core processes [...] it's when campuses have parallel processes, often on the backs of the same few people who have been doing this forever. And with not much institutional change
OGO: What exactly does she mean by “parallel” and “core”?
MNW: By parallel, she means something that’s tacked on — a new diversity office with limited authority, a multicultural center, mentoring programs. She calls this
Smith: project-itis, or programs — we're going to have mentoring programs to make people feel belonging, we have support programs for students, first generation students, for example — all of which are terribly important to support communities that often don't find themselves thriving in our institutions. But in terms of monitoring progress, it's mostly a parallel.
MNW: And it’s parallel because it’s not changing the central ways in which a university operates, like faculty hiring, leadership development, curriculum, research initiatives, campus climate.
OGO: So maybe a better term than “parallel” is “peripheral.”
MNW: Yes, and for Smith, diversity needs to move from the periphery to what she calls “core processes,” which might look like not only diverse faculty hiring, but requiring faculty to be able to deal with issues of diversity and structural inequity in their research; or making diversity part of every planning document and new policy that central admin makes, not just ones that fall under the “D&I” label; or making diversity key in capital campaigns, curriculum, and so on.
OGO: Okay, this makes more sense. But still, the technology analogy just strikes me as so pragmatic.
MNW: I mean, to an extent that’s the point. When diversity is a parallel, there’s no commitment. It’s easy to make an excuse. If diversity is seen as an imperative to the university’s mission, in Harvard’s case excellent scholarship, then it will be a priority for everyone, from the president to department chairs to professors to unit managers.
Smith: we have a lot of reasons that give her permission for failure. And one of my examples is, you know, if you were an advancement person in 2008 in the financial crisis, and you said to your President, ‘I can't raise any money,’ you would not be in your position. Now, you might modify your goals, you might figure out new strategies for engaging how you were going to sustain the work you do. But you wouldn't be permitted to say, ‘I can't.’ But for too long, the diversity effort has a lot of reasons and regrets. And I think this is where senior leadership at all levels of the institution, both faculty and administrative, become terribly important. This has to be a can do, not a reason why not.
MNW: So for a diversity review, this basically means a few things. One, the review should study and make recommendations about the core parts of the university, whether that be research production or faculty hiring or supporting low-wage workers. It can’t just be programs at the periphery. Two, it should recommend aligning leadership at all levels and in all schools or units toward this common goal. And three, it has to be urgent, and it can’t be optional.
OGO: I totally agree about the urgency of fostering and supporting diversity on college campuses, and, of course, in our entire society. Still, this analogy to technology, or the idea of “why would this be an imperative,” leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Don’t we lose something if diversity is primarily about performance, rather than equity? Isn’t there a risk diversity becomes cosmetic, or we become numbers-focused and don’t tackle the real, structural problems underneath? I mean, listen to this quote from the presidential task force report: “Initiatives to advance diversity, inclusion, and belonging should start and end with a focus on the academic and professional flourishing of all members of our campus community, rather than being formulated primarily as social problems.” What is racism if not a social problem?
MNW: Well there’s another way of looking at this, which is that maybe there’s no performance-equity binary — that for everyone to “flourish,” as the task force wrote, then you necessarily must tackle social problems. Diversity is central to academic excellence, whether that phrasing sounds good or not.
Smith: People who care about diversity issues, but actually to 21st century scholarship to good knowledge, excellent knowledge. And I've got plenty of examples of bad knowledge. Facial recognition software that doesn't recognize dark skin or different features, is not excellent. So who was sitting around the table testing that? If seatbelts are designed, and the early seatbelts, which people fought for forever in cars — well, turns out they were pretty dangerous to children and small people, particularly women. Why was that? Because when the engineers were designing the structure of the seat belt, they had the idea of a generic human being of a certain size, turns out bigger than the average woman and certainly bigger than the average child. That's not excellent to me.
OGO: So maybe equity and performance are necessary for one another? For Smith, a high-performing institution must be diverse and equitable, and for an institution to be equitable, people from structurally disadvantaged backgrounds have to have the support and opportunity to excel. I can understand how this is a useful metric, even if it doesn’t suit my ethical/moral sensibility.
MNW: Yes, exactly.
OGO: Okay, so we’ve talked a lot about diversity as a goal. Now let’s return to the specific review at hand, the 2018 Presidential Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging. Or, as we like to say on this podcast, let’s review the review, after the break.
Segment 3
OGO: The task force’s first recommendation was “Inclusive Symbols and Spaces.” They found many people, especially from marginalized backgrounds, felt the Harvard built environment was unwelcoming. So this includes actions like a revised ‘values statement,’ small accessibility changes to the public spaces of Harvard, and changing the lyrics of the Harvard 'alma mater’ to be more inclusive, though I probably couldn’t have told you the original lyrics.
MNW: My immediate — cynical — response is that this is purely cosmetic. It’s literally about the visual parts of Harvard. But thinking about it, making Harvard’s built environment inclusive is super important, it’s the physical and spatial context for everything that happens at the University — so making the physical space truly supportive is in some ways prerequisite to other diversity and inclusion efforts.
OGO: For sure, although let’s not get our hopes up. The change to the alma mater was quick. But to further implement this recommendation, Harvard in September of 2020 — that’s two and a half years after the presidential task force released its report — convened another task force, the FAS Task Force on Visual Signage and Culture. This committee will study the physical and visual environment at Harvard. This could mean, for instance, thinking about the tendency for Harvard seminar rooms to be lined with mahogany, and have busts of very very dead, very very wealthy men.
MNW: And that task force is only for FAS — presumably other schools will have to create additional task forces. I’m seeing a trend. Committees and reports lead to new committees and reports.
OGO: They tend to. First, Harvard had the 2015 Working Group, which led to the 2018 Presidential Task Force. Then, from the 2018 Task Force, it has this new Task Force on visual culture launched in the fall of 2020.
MNW: Not to mention yet another committee related to inclusive spaces, also convened at the end of 2020, to consider principles for renaming at Harvard.
OGO: These long chains of reviews seem a little like a delay tactic. It sounds almost corporate, a way to say, “we’re doing something, we recognize there’s a problem,” but really just using that to respond to criticism. I posed this question, about the utility of diversity reviews, to another expert on them, Frances X. Frei. She’s a professor at the Harvard Business School who specializes in improving diversity and inclusion at a corporate level. She’s the person who went into Uber after their storm of sexual harrassment and discrimination allegations, and tried to improve the environment. She gives Ted Talks on this sort of thing. In the months before she headed to Uber, she also worked on the presidential Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging.
Frei: I think it can be good or can be bad. If they're used as license to postpone action, they make my head spin. If they are used, because we're really time sensitive and because we want to, like, learn from diverse perspectives, great. But task forces that are, oh, we have a problem, let's put a taskforce and, let’s just postpone the problem for like a year or two years, and it doesn't really have decision rights. To me, I get worried that that's — I don't mean this in a bad way, but the organization is stalling.
MNW: Okay, but we could also say continued study shows continued commitment. And we can acknowledge that, frankly, Harvard is full of scholars who like studying and believe in the value of understanding an issue in as many ways as possible. And okay, renaming and inclusive spaces kind of smacks of image preservation and clearly falls into this pattern of repeated reviews on a slow timeframe. But that’s only one out of eight recommendations. Let’s try to be optimistic.
OGO: Alright, let’s look at more. Recommendation number two, “Two University-Wide Research Centers to Expand the University’s Research Agenda.”
MNW: Which is basically to create two faculty-led initiatives that will think about ways to incorporate diversity into the central teaching and research missions at Harvard — exactly what Smith would want to see out of a review, thinking about diversity in the core activities. Although, this is a highly public and polished report, so of course it sounds good. As Smith might add, what matters is follow-through
Smith: Too many reports will say things like we urge deans and department chairs. We are long past the urging. People are too busy. If this is optional, we’ve got too much on our plate.
OGO: To that end, these two interfaculty initiatives sound a lot like still more diversity reviews. And in turn, those initiatives will do their own reviews, with further delay.
MNW: Although, both interfaculty initiatives were formed and led by senior professors, none of whom agreed to interviews. It doesn’t appear these two committees are active today, but they definitely influenced Harvard. The University Office for Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging has launched numerous new efforts since the task force, and last summer Harvard hired its first Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer. They also have a council on diversity, inclusion, and belonging composed of senior leadership from all the schools and central units, that meets monthly. Clearly, people at every level of leadership are at least thinking about diversity. Although whether this is projectitis remains to be seen.
OGO: Alright, but let’s zoom out and consider the timeline. 2007 is the “I Am Harvard” protest. 2014 is “I, Too, Am Harvard.” 2015 is the College working group. 2016 through 2018 is the presidential task force. In 2020 Harvard hires a D&I Officer. It’s 2021 and we’re still waiting for big changes, and we’re still hearing of terrible experiences from students, staff, and faculty who are nonwhite, or not male, or not straight.. All in all, fourteen years have passed.
MNW: One recent, stunning, and preventable failure that comes to mind is how some have alleged Harvard did not prepare very well to support low income students in the move to Zoom last spring.
OGO: Exactly. Ugh, the language Harvard uses around diversity and inclusion — “Chief Diversity Officer,” alignment, “professional flourishing,” central units — is so sanitized and sounds like corporate PR. More generally this reminds me of the quip some like to make, that Harvard is a large corporation that happens to run a research university.
MNW: Wait, hold on a sec — let’s take that quip seriously, at least for a moment. Harvard is literally the oldest corporation in the United States, dating to 1650 — and so its investments, and what “performance” means for Harvard, are deeply tied up with hierarchies and legacies of slavery, land theft, and centuries-old elitism. An associated editor of the magazine, and a friend, Becca Cadenhead, brought up to us that, if we consider that how Harvard might have profit motives and not just be purely a research university, than the definition of ‘performance’ changes pretty drastically, as does the meaning of the University’s slow pace on diversity:
REJC: So, I think we probably shouldn’t ignore that one of Harvard’s main priorities is to remain financially solvent so that it’ll exist in the long term. The school is a non-profit, but the way that it manages its investments is similar to what you’d see from a hedge fund. And as I see it, most of what we could call its quote-unquote ‘profitability’ is related to its endowment, its day-to-day financial operations (like paying employees), and maintaining its public image (which is why people pay to go here). So basically these are also things that are likely taken into account when Harvard measures its own performance. I’m not saying that they’re more important than everything else, but they definitely hold significant weight. And I think that it’s possible that drastically changing the university to prioritize not only diversity, but real equity, would probably interfere with some of those goals.
MNW: Isn’t there a sense in which diversity would improve Harvard’s image or make it perform better?
REJC: Maybe, but Harvard doesn’t actually work like a traditional corporation — its income sources are different because its product is different. On a basic level, a lot of the changes that would be necessary to make the institution more equitable would just cost a lot of money, which makes them initially unappealing. They’re also questionable as a long term financial investment; some actions that would suggest that Harvard is committed to equity, like changing its financial investments or relying less on contracted or part-time workers, are probably bad for the budget. There’s also a part of me that thinks that in becoming too diverse or too equitable, Harvard could lose some of the perception of exclusivity that it benefits so much from.
MNW: In it’s most recent admissions cycle, class of 2025, harvard admitted record numbers of minority and first generation students. It’s also the most exclusive admissions cycle ever, with a record low admissions rate due to a record number of applicants. So Harvard’s gates are still, to most, closed. The question is in part that of at what scale, on whose terms, we define inclusion and exclusion. And there’s the context of affirmative action and a lot of scrutiny — a lot of risk to Harvard’s image — to consider as well
OGO: Part of what you’re asking seems to be, inclusion into what — if Harvard’s prestige comes from elitism, then diversity efforts will only ever be a partial inclusion into an exclusionary culture.
REJC: And to that end, Harvard also doesn’t have much of an incentive to change. A very obvious and awful implication of the discourse around corporate diversity is that corporations will only become more diverse to the extent that it makes them more competitive. But Harvard’s reputation and endowment are unparalleled — if diversity is only something that you prioritize when you’re trying to give yourself an edge, then Harvard might just not need to expend the effort.
OGO: What Becca’s saying, about Harvard having less incentive than a company to explore diversity, reminds me a lot of something Frei — who studies corporate diversity — mentioned:
Frei: Most companies don't have that kind of time because inclusion is an urgent and achievable goal, and the reason you want to do this is because you're going to get thumped by the competition who's doing it, from a performance perspective. There are some organizations that don't have, that are insulated from the competitive dynamics Not always so great, and they could take five or 10 years to do something.
OGO: Interestingly, Frei thought the 2018 presidential task force resolved this problem because it does articulate why inclusion and belonging are essential to Harvard’s quote-unquote performance.
Frei: It articulates, and I thought really beautifully, that some people might — this is my interpretation of it. But some people might think that inclusion is at odds with performance. Or in their case, in this case, I think performance was academic freedom. But you can do it with, it's at odds, they can work if you're really careful, or they actually are synergistic. In my experience, and organizations that like, if you're not inclusive today, and you become inclusive, tomorrow, you are going to skyrocket the performance of the organization.
MNW: So the report, for Frei, did a good job of creating a performance incentive for diversity. If we credit that explanation — we should recall that Frei was on the task force — then recommendations one and two seem net promising, but slow to come to fruition. Let’s go on to three.
OGO: Third, they recommended enhancing mental health resources, with special attention to the acute needs students from marginalized backgrounds can face.
MNW: Well, we know from our reporting on the Yardfest report that in the past couple of years Harvard has hired more mental health professionals of color, added diversity trainings, and generally tried to make it easier and more affordable to access mental health care.
OGO: Sure, but on the other hand a big part of implementing this recommendation was the Provost’s Task Force on Mental Health — another review committee. And that task force found 62% of students report having rates of loneliness, over were 30% diagnosed with or concerned about depressive or anxiety disorders, and more. Students have been lamenting long wait lines at CAMHS, and the report found a student-counselor ratio of 468 to 1, as well as multi-week waits between first contact and an appointment in 2019. This was all worse for minority, BGLTQ+, and FGLI students. Not to mention the terrible mental health struggles students have faced during Covid, often with limited University support. I hate to repeat myself, but again, the stakes are so high, and the process is just so slow.
MNW: Sure, but maybe it’s not stalling. We’re seeing, in the first three recommendations, the University taking first steps to make itself more inclusive — maybe it’s just that Harvard, again, really likes to study, so those well-intentioned initiatives take the form of reviews and reports, instead of urgent actions, which can be frustrating. I asked Smith about this:
MNW: Framed that way, these reports, and this information suddenly becomes really important, I guess. We've also like, sometimes it feels like the act of writing the report. You know, the act of saying, like we've identified a problem becomes a substitute for we've solved the problem
Smith: or we've made progress on the problem. Let's, you know, campuses will get caught up in, and this is where sometimes we use the wrong language, what's the goal for faculty diversity? And I don't want to have that conversation. I don't want to spend the next 10 years discussing whether the goal should be the demographics of the country, the demographics of the student body, the demographics of PhDs. I just want to mark progress, and I'd like the line to be more than just incrementally flat or down. I'd like it to be up. You know, it's quite a clear visual. Up.
OGO: A trend I’m seeing here is that the reports aren’t necessarily an inherent problem. The review process is a tool for people to use, or not use. And so then the reviews become important because they can be a well or poorly-crafted tool, and they can either be conducive to urgent action or to further study and delay. When reviews do become an impediment is when diagnosing the problem gets in the way of tackling it.
Smith: When a campus knows about a toxic department, for example. I was on a campus where somebody said, Would you do a study of which departments are toxic for faculty? And I said, you already know which department. There are people on your campus who already know it, you don't need to hire somebody to go do a study. So it's that kind of thing, even at the local level, where you want to see people dealing with issues even when they're known. And that's been the challenge of institutions. And our response is often sort of bureaucratic. We have procedures, but how about dealing with it? Because meanwhile, people are paying the price.
OGO: So the sort of well-intentioned, bureaucratic process needs to be shaken-up. Yet, I see that the next three recommendations from the 2018 report come under a category called “Sustained Focus on Inclusive Excellence” — it sounds like they take the (even) long(er) view.
MNW: Well, let’s look. Recommendations four and five are, I’m sorry to say, a bit corporate in their wording, about, quote, “School and Business Unit Strategic-Planning Work” and “Alignment and Coordination of Inclusive Excellence Work in the Office of the President and Provost.”
OGO: Gross. Behind the doublespeak, what does that look like?
MNW: Actually, if we apply Smith’s framework of core processes and the importance of senior leadership being invested in diversity, recommendations four and five might be the most promising. These recommendations are saying Harvard should work to coordinate across all the schools and offices to prioritize inclusion and belonging, and that all of this should be under the purview of the president and the provost — that’s as core as you can get. Now these recommendations, unsurprisingly, in part took the form of individual schools and units conducting their own diversity reviews. But at least Faust set deadlines of about seven months to submit those reviews to central admin.
Smith: The reality is that anybody in charge of those things will drill down and say ‘Where were the gaps?’ And that's usually in a school or a department at a local level. The President doesn't need to know that the art department overspent its budget, but the department chair should. And if it's not being built at that level, the cumulative effect over the long haul will be a budget deficit. And that's what we've got with diversity. So this has to be aligned and it can't be optional.
OGO: Okay, but I do want to put the breaks on your optimism — what Smith is saying is that although the public side of these reports seems vague and opaque, what matters more is the private side, that all school leadership is dedicated and working together. But who is going to hold them accountable to that? Like, we’ll never know about these internal reviews that Faust commissioned. Is the burden always on the people most hurt by the problem to demand transparency?
MNW: Well, if the leadership is dedicated to diversity, then there being a private side to these reviews is a good thing, because it means people are getting into the nitty-gritty. On the other hand, you’re totally right — it’s exhausting for students to be the ones holding Harvard accountable. And kind of useless, since we graduate in four years. Someone else I talked to about this was Natasha Warikoo, a professor at Tufts who used to be on the faculty at Harvard GSE and has studied diversity at Harvard and similar institutions for a long time. And she also thinks these diversity reviews are tools, and you need dedicated leaders who behind the scenes are working hard to implement them.
Warikoo: I think on the one hand, there are a lot of people who are very committed to trying to change the institution [...] on the other hand, I do, I think there is an argument to be made that these, these reports are sort of, quell and sort of, you know, put a stop to or, don't put a stop to, but sort of say, ‘okay, we're doing something,’ when we're not actually doing something. And I think that there is a little bit of that. And I think another issue that I didn't mention earlier is that the, you know, the undergraduates are largely the students who are really pushing for a lot of these changes. Undergraduates, you have a full turnover of the student body in four years
OGO: Right, if the burden is on students to pressure the University to change then it won’t happen — the reviews outlive the students, like what Hilda said. This makes me think of something Dorothy said in our conversation, the opposite of Hilda’s skepticism. After she graduated from Harvard — in theory the point when the University could cast aside her voice — instead she realized she felt so empowered by her experience being involved University administration through the Working Group — she saw it as an opportunity to make real change — that she started working in the Harvard College Office of Student Life. And she could be a fly on the wall, observing the way Harvard administration functions, and why they are often so trepidatious. Still in higher ed management, she now leads faculty development at Paul Quin College.
Villarreal: We were very weary of making big changes, because Harvard is a big lumbering institution, where, you know, one small flutter of a butterfly wing really can create a whole Cyclone. [...] And so I think, at Harvard, there's a sense of seriousness about any decision that you make is going to have a deep impact long term. And that could affect the country in ways that you may not have even imagined before.
OGO: But the way she explained this, the hesitation came from a place of care. The administrators were slow because they wanted to do right by their students — and, potentially, a lot of students beyond their purview.
Villareal: And I mean, the thing too is that they're also learning, right? Like, I think it's, it's really easy for us to kind of think like, Oh, well, you know, why don't they just get it? And the truth is that, you know, they're still learning a lot of things and I think, to their boon, you know, they really care about learning about the student perspective, and keeping up with the evolution of students’ thoughts and their perspective.
OGO: This makes sense to me; I want to see these administrators as people, too. But again, administrators can keep learning and checking on the student perspective forever, but at a certain point, there has to be a next step. Like the PULSE survey, which we talked about last episode — that was recommendation seven by the presidential task force. And they implemented it. But it doesn’t directly improve anything; it’s data collection. Just as Dorothy saw the stakes of the Harvard name as putting a lot of pressure on administrators to do things right, Warikoo sees that as an opportunity for real change.
Warikoo: And, you know, I've always felt, you know, especially when I was embedded in Harvard, that this is probably one of the few universities that if the university makes a big change, and does something bold, and radical, they will not lose status, because of the name Harvard, and that in some ways, they could be a real leader and say, we're gonna do this, we're gonna do this differently. [...] and a lot of people copy them because if Harvard does it, it must be a good thing to do. And, you know, I feel like, in some ways University was not, and is not always kind of bold enough
Segment 4
MNW: Fifty years ago, in the 1970s, in that crucible of change that Monroe and Dorothy Villarreal describe, Harvard had a choice to make.
Warikoo : So if you go even back to the push to have a center for students of color on the Brown and Harvard campuses. Brown University, after student activists were pushing for a center, eventually opened what was then called for many years the Third World center, and you know, when you look at the goals of the Third World — when I was doing this research it was actually still called the Third World center — and when you look at the, the goals of the Third World center, they were really about supporting students of color. There was a sort of social justice orientation to its mission. And Harvard, on the other hand, really pushed back against student activists who were also pushing for a third world Center at Harvard for many years. And finally many years later, long after Brown opened the Third World center, Harvard decided to do it, do things its own way, rather than respond to the students’ desires, and decided to open the Harvard foundation for Intercultural Affairs. And so you can see even in the name of the, of the foundation, a much more kind of integrationist approach.
MNW: That’s Warikoo again — she wrote a whole book about approaches to race and diversity at Harvard, Brown, and some British universities. In her research she found that when students demanded a Third World center in the 1970s, Harvard did not open a center explicitly devoted to supporting students of color. Instead, in 1981, Harvard formed the Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations. They chose what Warikoo calls an ‘integrationist’ approach, encouraging white and nonwhite student interaction and running student programs “designed to promote interracial and intercultural awareness and understanding” — but not aimed to support students of color to build solidarity or analyze and tackle structural inequities. The Third World Center at Brown, now called the Center for Students of Color, capitulated to the demands of radical student activists in the 1970s and focuses on the needs and experience of students of color in particular, helping them build unity, and to make sense of and take actions against structural racism, rather than promoting interaction between white and nonwhite students.
Warikoo: The advantage of Brown’s was that for students of color these institutions became — some, not all — some students of color they became kind of places where they really developed a deeper understanding of the world, of racism, of inequality, and developed social ties, both to people who were their own race but also other racial minorities.
Warikoo: And so, but white students were kind of excluded from that and didn't always understand, like, why did they all get together before freshman orientation, and kind of were a little perplexed by the Third World center.”
OGO: This is interesting, and kind of reminds me of the objections to the separate ‘Black Convocation’ at Harvard — where incoming Black students are welcomed to the school in a special ceremony — by outlets like Fox News. By creating venues for solidarity among students of color, white students feel ‘excluded.’ I’m skeptical of that ‘exclusion’ instinct, because it doesn’t acknowledge the way Harvard can be a hostile environment for students of color, and the ways they would need to come together.
Warikoo: Whereas at Harvard, you know, white students were included, but these, these centers didn't didn't seem to go as deep into really pushing for a difficult conversation. So, you know, what I say in the book is that we, we need a little bit of both, right — we need everybody to be part of the conversation, including white students, but we also need to go deeper than a kind of superficial look at difference.
MNW: Harvard chose this intercultural approach and has stuck to it for 40 years. We see that legacy in the 2018 Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging. The 2018 report isn’t specifically about: how can we better include students of color, or people who have been socially disempowered. It’s: how can we try to include everyone, no matter what advantage or disadvantage they have? Dorothy said something to this effect, about the College Working Group that predated the presidential task force.
Dorothy: Because the idea that, you know, we were creating something that was just for students of color to feel better, I think, is something that we very much tried to move away from, right. The idea is that when, when we make the college welcoming, and inclusive for everybody, all students will reap the benefits from it.
OGO: But, going back to Warikoo’s sentiment, when we start to ask the questions of who is included and why, in really concrete terms — especially when the context is a long history of disempowerment and marginalization of specific groups in the United States — it gets tricky, and a little hard to talk about.
MNW: In fact, the report emphasizes some groups that don’t have a particularly strong history of marginalization. One thing we noticed when reading the report was how often it mentions the suppression of conservative voices on campus. Here, I’ll find a quote: “In our outreach sessions, we heard a clear theme that many conservative students on campus engage in self-censorship to avoid possible alienation from peer groups.”
OGO: It’s a little strange to me that, in one of the largest diversity and inclusion efforts at the college, they would choose to give so much space to this single issue of conservative suppression. Sure, it’s a hot topic and a recent issue, but it’s not as entrenched as the university’s history of racism and exclusion on the basis of gender, economic status, country of origin. It’s not that free expression isn’t important and central to inclusion. In fact, Smith says,
Smith: I mean, I was a young Dean years ago, when I was involved in creating free speech policies on campuses, to allow the Black Panthers and Angela Davis to speak. I mean, there's a history there about that. [...] But I also think it's really important to just remember that speech, free speech policies came because that was a Black movement that was being suppressed. So how do we navigate that in our society? And of course, we're seeing it nationally now and using free speech as an excuse for things that are just unacceptable. And what kind of speech is acceptable? How does it campus speak about it?”
OGO: It is — and will always — be important to inclusion and diversity that people with different views can express their ideas freely. How else will people learn and grow? But when Harvard focuses on ‘difference’ in this really broad way, and gives a lot of space to the suppression of conservative voices in their report, well, it seems to me that they aren’t taking into account power differentials, or the very structure of our society. And those are much, much harder issues to dive deeply into, as Warikoo describes. It returns us to the questions, inclusion for who? And inclusion into what? For the University’s performance, or for the benefit of students? Into a truly welcoming environment, or a culture and space that is otherwise hierarchical?
Warikoo: sometimes it's irritating when political identity gets pulled into that, that, you know that it starts to feel like we're saying that being conservative on the Harvard campus is, is, you know, it is equivalent to being, say, an underrepresented minority. I think those are very different experiences. But, you know, when we're talking about feelings of belonging, they get sort of lumped together. So I think we need both of those, we need like a sustained focus on the roots of some of these forms of inequality and then we also need sustained focus on creating dialogue to be able to discuss these things in an open and honest manner.
MNW: It gets back to the whole performance vs. equity thing, I think — if diversity is defined in terms of performance, whether that’s teaching or research or profit, then the perception of academic freedom becomes a more important metric. And so this kind of flattened notion of inclusion risks superseding specifically tackling historical inequities. Like, the tools and approach Harvard takes in addressing the ‘inclusion’ of conservative students is — or should be — very different from the approach they would take in creating a better environment for Black students.
OGO: And those tools will also shift with time. If we think back to the study of race relations in 1980, Harvard’s approach to diversity as intercultural interaction, not structural analyses of power, made sense, given the general tenor of American mainstream politics. But now we’re in a different place, as a school and a country —
MNW: But we were also in a different place in 2007 than we were in 2011 than we were in 2015 than we were in 2018. Time keeps passing, and new reports — updated to the time they’re in, constantly trying to stay abreast of the national and campus conversation — keep coming out, and eventually, some action will need to take place. So, on one hand, yes, the tools need to shift with time, and the diversity reviews should reflect the current times. On the other, I fear that leads us to an outcome similar to what Smith described in our conversation.
Smith: in the last chapter of my book, I tried to pull all that together in terms of the importance for leadership, and leadership at every level. That means the faculty chairs, that means the president, the provost, the deans, the department just have to understand this as an imperative. Otherwise, we will have lovely people pulling together lovely reports, hand it in, and we'll be back — I hope not — five years from now to have this conversation again
Segment 5
OGO: So diversity reviews — under the right leadership, they can track progress and create impetus for change. Or they can stall and delay, substituting identifying the problem for implementing a solution.
MNW: And at a sprawling institution like Harvard, it’s hard to know how they’re functioning — we see what seem like serious efforts to move diversity from the periphery to the core of the University, but they’re so slow, so we remain skeptical, even pessimistic, about whether these reviews are substantive or cosmetic, about performance or equity or a bit of each.
OGO: Well, if the 2018 task force and everything we’ve learned from all these experts provide a framework, let’s apply it — full circle to where we started this podcast, thinking about policing and racism at Harvard. In the summer of 2020, the 2018 presidential task force’s charge to the University was put to the test when Harvard police officers were cited at a Black Lives Matter rally far from Harvard’s campus, adding heightened urgency to concerns over racism, diversity, and policing that have circulated for decades.
MNW: And, of course, Harvard responded with a review. But students sought to take matters into their own hands, to hold Harvard accountable — at the same time that President Lawrence S. Bacow announced an independent review of HUPD last summer, a coalition of abolitionist activists and students embarked on their own review of HUPD. In the two-part finale of Under Review, we’ll put those reports — one top-down and University sanctioned, the other bottom-up and written by students — side-by-side.
HUPD protest: we know about the Harvard police being called in as reinforcements to intimidate protestors in Boston who filled the streets to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade, and George Floyd.
Bond: what we hope for a review like this is figuring out what the next version of any given unit is, whether it's the police or health and wellness, health facilities
Noah Harris: It's like they're resistant to, to change, but at the same time they're asking us, you know, how we should change HUPD?

About Under Review:
How can Harvard, an institution with so much history, have so little memory?
The racial reckonings and Black Lives Matter protests that swept the country this past summer brought attention to a trend in how Harvard seems to deal with student activism and concerns surrounding race, racism, and diversity: to commission a diversity review. These committees and reports long predate this summer, and reading them it can seem, at times, like some things have not changed at the University — in race relations, Harvard’s review process, or the findings and recommendations. What can these diversity reviews accomplish, and what can’t they?
“Under Review” is a podcast from The Harvard Crimson, hosted by Matteo Wong and Olivia Oldham, chairs of The Crimson’s weekly magazine, Fifteen Minutes. Each week, they will explore controversies and diversity reviews stretching across 40 years of Harvard history, speaking to dozens of students, activists, experts, and more, to try and understand how the Harvard diversity review works — or doesn’t.

OGO: Coming up, on Under Review
Lawrence S. Bacow: Here in Harvard Yard, we must embrace diversity in every possible dimension
Ifeoluwani “Ife” E. Omidiran: During the course of writing our report, our members had to go in person into HUPD office, in the middle of this pandemic, in order to gain access to these records
Brenda Bond: what we hope for a review like this is figuring out what the next version of any given unit is, whether it's the police or health and wellness, health facilities
Noah Harris: “It's like they're resistant to, to change, but at the same time they're asking us, you know, how we should change HUPD?”

MNW: We’re finally returning to where we started this podcast — the summer of 2020, when on June 2 a Twitter image of a Harvard University Police Department officer assisting Boston police at a BLM protest in Franklin Park went viral. Here’s a protest that, in response to that sighting, called for the abolition of the HUPD.

Abolish HUPD Protest, June 2020: we know about the Harvard police being called in as reinforcements to intimidate protestors in Boston who filled the streets to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade, and George Floyd.
Omidiran: A couple of days after President Lawrence Bacow sent an email where he was lamenting the murder of George Floyd and kind of talking about Harvard's investment in civil rights, just a few days after that photos emerged of HUPD officers who were patrolling a Black Lives Matter vigil at Franklin Park, which is a neighborhood, sorry, it's a park in Dorchester, which is, you know, presumably pretty far from what Harvard police's jurisdiction ought to be. And so, yeah, so we, after seeing that, we were pretty enraged
MNW: That’s Ifeoluwani “Ife” E. Omidiran, class of 2022, a member of the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign who helped lead student organizing after this image circulated.
Omidiran: It is really upsetting to not only see just knowing like walking around on campus, seeing HUPD officers who are armed who have guns who are fully their full police officers with arrest power, even outside of Harvard's gates. It doesn't make me as a Black woman feel safer. It isn't comforting whatsoever. And then to see this really stark contradiction in what the University espouses its values to be and espouses, you know, to have this investment in Black lives, and then having its officers go and patrol this vigil
MNW: We’ll hear more from Ife, who is a Crimson arts editor, in a bit. Naturally, President Bacow responded to the uproar over this photo with another letter to the Harvard community — a letter announcing an external review of the Harvard University Police Department. He wrote that the presence of HUPD officers at this protest “raised legitimate questions in the Harvard community about the appropriate role of HUPD in responding to protests over the brutal killing of George Floyd.” and that many have asked, “what role does HUPD play beyond our campus and how can we ensure this role is consistent with our commitment to community policing and community values?”
OGO: Bacow announced that the consulting group 21CP Solutions — short for 21st Century Policing — would conduct an independent review of the HUPD and make recommendations for how to best ensure public safety at Harvard and the surrounding communities. This is Brenda Bond, a professor at Suffolk University and one of the 21CP reviewers:
Bond: we just sort of merged our efforts and responded to the request to really take a look operationally what the Harvard University Police Department is doing but also to consider what they're doing operationally in light of what was happening nationally around police community conflict, racial injustice, brutality, and things like that
OGO: But at the same time that Bond was helping lead one review of the Harvard University Police Department, Ife helped lead another — this one conducted by a group of students called the Harvard Alliance Against Campus Cops, or HAACC for short.
Omidiran: So from there, we did some more research. And we found that HUPD has these, what they call mutual aid agreements with Cambridge, the Boston Police Department, and other law enforcement agencies. And so we really are, what the work that we're trying to do is to call for the abolition of HUPD and also to, to sort of dispel the myth that University Police officers are this, like harmless, or softer police force. We've been doing research, and we're anticipating our release of our long form report in a couple of weeks, which does, presents our really extensive resource research into the history of HUPD and how, since its founding, it's been a force for the protection of whiteness and property.
MNW: The two reviews, one commissioned by the University and the other conducted by student activists, were prompted by the same event and released their final reports within two weeks of each other last December. Though there are some similarities between the two, they have tremendous differences — in process, findings, and recommendations. A brief synopsis: The HAACC review concludes that Harvard should defund its police force by 80 to 100 percent.
Abolish HUPD Protest: to call for the complete and immediate abolition of the Harvard University Police Department
MNW: While the 21CP review provides a process for the Harvard community to begin reimagining public safety at the University in the long-term, which is admittedly a bit vague, as well as some short-term reforms to HUPD procedures. We expected these reports to be diametrically opposed, one to call for defunding and one for community police reforms — but we also found some surprising points of commonality. So in our final two episodes, we’re putting these reviews head to head — a duel, of sorts. I’m Matteo Wong
OGO: And I’m Olivia Oldham,
MNW: You’re listening to Under Review, a podcast from the Harvard Crimson’s magazine, Fifteen Minutes, in which we’re exploring what we call the Harvard diversity review.
OGO: We started our circuitous journey with another flashpoint over policing on campus from 2018, then jumped to the first diversity review, the study of race relations in 1980, and then back to 2018 to examine diversity reviews more broadly. We’ve explored patterns of how Harvard responds, with varying success, to concerns over policing, racism, and diversity — looked at when diversity reviews fail, when they work, and how they function at this university.
MNW: Now we’re ready to throw that understanding into a radically different context, the heightened attention that the summer of 2020 brought the life-or-death consequences of police racism and the nation-wide Movement for Black Lives. With countless past reviews of diversity, policing, and race in Harvard’s archives — and now in our minds — in this two-part finale, we ask, How has Harvard’s approach to racism, diversity, and student well-being changed through 2021? Harvard is a university with a long and rich history, but just how sharp is its institutional memory?
2018 Visitas protest: Black Lives Matter, at Harvard, too. Black lives matter! Black lives matter!
Segment 1
Bond: my name is Brenda bond Fortier. I have a dual role. So my full time job is a Professor of Public Administration at Suffolk University, where I teach in the Master of Public Administration program [...] But then I also do a number of external projects, where I engage with different police agencies and universities. And part of that work happens with the 21CP Solutions team. So I've been working with them recently doing some of these Campus Public Safety reviews
MNW: Before leading the external review of HUPD prompted by the summer of 2020, Bond was already consulting on an internal review of the Harvard police force — that review prompted by a bombshell report from a colleague of ours at The Crimson, Ema Schumer, which unveiled decades of alleged sexism, racism, and nepotism inside HUPD’s ranks under the leadership of Police Chief Francis “Bud” Riley.
OGO: Right, and in response, Chief Riley announced an internal review of the force’s culture and policies, conducted by five HUPD officers, Bond, and another consultant — unsurprisingly, another diversity and climate review, of sorts. Riley would oversee that review directly. His leadership in that review , however,raised concerns among some HUPD officers, who didn’t want Riley, the alleged source of some of the problems internal to the police force, leading the investigation.
MNW: Yes, and so this new independent review, which reported directly to Executive Vice President Katie Lapp, was viewed much more favorably by the HUPD rank-and-file. So Bond had already been working with the HUPD prior to June 2020, and Bacow and 21CP Solutions then brought her on to this independent review. That Crimson investigation into HUPD’s internal culture also meant our campus and Harvard students were discussing reforming or abolishing campus police well before the summer.
OGO: And you add to that uproar over recent incidents with Harvard police officers harassing people of color in the Smith Center, or being called to investigate a class of Latinx students setting up a performance in the Yard, or assisting at an abolish ICE rally — which have led to a lot of anger at HUPD among students. And perhaps as a result of these broader tensions, as well as the immediate context of the summer of 2020, the review of HUPD in 2020 had a much broader charge than, say, that of the 2018 Yardfest review — they were to review public safety and policing in general, rather than a specific incident and its implications.
Bond: Our approach is really to help, to help leadership and administrators sort of think about, what is it you want to achieve in this process. And at Harvard, it was sort of like, We want to, we want to make sure that we are doing what we should be doing around campus safety and well being.
Bond: Our review is to both look at official documents about how things work, but then to ground that in what we hear from community conversations about what they want, what they don't want. And then to pull all that together and compare it to what we know about best practices, what we know about the research, what we know about where campus public safety is going, and to offer those observations and recommendations to the University.
MNW: It may not surprise you that the word “community” came up a lot in our conversation.
OGO: As it has in every report we’ve looked at so far. It’s such a capacious term — I’m curious to know what community meant for this specific review?
Bond: I completely understand the concern, or the potential frustration that we weren’t able to reach, you know, different people, different groups. And we're faced with the challenge of trying to engage as many people as possible in many different ways. And so interviews, focus groups, and either, whether it's an online survey or an email, an anonymous email that would come to us, those are the kinds of things that we try to do. We obviously also look at social media, we pay attention to what's going on around the campus. And we take that into consideration so that we can at least try to triangulate and use more than one source.
MNW: But we know a lot of voices will inevitably be left out of any review — think back to the 1980 study on race relations. And you add to that limitations imposed by the pandemic. So elected student representatives, for instance, we know they talked to extensively. But, for instance, the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign was not contacted, nor was the Black Students Association, according to its vice president, and nor was HAACC, according to Ife.
Ife: I know they had some conversations with the UC, trying to reach out to various stakeholders. And so it's, I think it's telling that, like activist groups are not on the list. That's not someone they consider a stakeholder
Bond: a limitation in any review is that something is left out. And what we try to do is, you know, make a strong statement in our report that says, we could not engage everybody and it's, we would implore the university to try to figure out How to do that. And to recognize and hear the voice of people who have really great concerns about different aspects of the University community.
OGO: I get their sample size won’t be nearly as large as the University population, but those organizations you mentioned are extremely, extremely visible — they’re hard to forget about. Her answer doesn’t do much to resolve my concerns about the word “community.” Like just frankly, a white, wealthy guy descended from four generations of Harvard who plays competitive squash is part of Harvard’s community, but it would make more sense to speak with the Generational African American Students Association or the prison divestment campaign to understand concerns over policing at Harvard than the squash team.
MNW: Right, it’s kind of a cop out to chalk everything up to the community. If you don’t identify who in the community voiced which opinion then you aren’t really getting the nuance of what the campus thinks of policing and how those opinions are divided.
MNW: And when I asked professor cornell brooks, of the kennedy school and former head of the NAACP, about what has made past efforts to reform or end violent policing fail, he pointed to approaching policing in general, without addressing the specifics of racism, as a big part of the problem
Cornell W. Brooks: Some of it has to do with the focus on performing policing broadly without addressing racism particularly. So in other words, race drives much of what is wrong about policing, right. So in other words, when we look at the disparities, Latinos, Muslims, Asians, trans folk, members of the LGBTQ community — there are particular groups whose arrest, whose incarceration, whose surveillance, whose profiling, represent disparate multiples compared to white people. Right, so in other words, if you address the problem technocratically and broadly, without addressing it with racial and ethnic and gender and gender identity specificity, you miss the point
MNW: Thankfully, I was able to talk to some of the members of the community that Bond spoke with, since we started our reporting well before the report was issued in December
Noah Harris: I'm Noah Harris. I'm a junior at the college in Dunster house, if we were in person, and I'm studying government. And on the undergraduate Council, I am the treasurer.
MNW: Noah was in one of these focus groups last fall. They were these hour-long Zoom meetings, during which the 21CP asked some general questions. Here’s Bond’s description:
Bond: our work is centered around listening, maybe asking some probing questions or some facilitating questions, where we say, ‘Tell us, community, tell us what you think safety looks like or what makes you feel safe. Do the police make you feel safe? Or do they make you not feel safe?’
MNW: Noah thought this focus group went well.
Harris: Forgive me, it was like three weeks ago now. But the, the two individuals or the three individuals that were conducting it, I believe, did a really good job. They were not affiliated with HUPD and they let us know that so that we could speak freely about our experiences or the experiences of friends or the experiences that we have witnessed.
MNW: Noah said one of the key concerns he and the other UC reps brought up was a lack of transparency around HUPD, not knowing what exactly their responsibilities are, not knowing much about follow-up, discipline, or changes to police policy when controversial incidents occur, and so on. Which meant the UC couldn’t give the reviews very specific suggestions — they hadn’t been privy to the mechanics of HUPD
Harris: I think it was, it was pretty productive. But at the same time, it was it was hard for us to, to kind of pinpoint exactly what the issue was because we we can't even, we can't even learn from the past experiences, because all we saw was the end result, we didn't see the practice that led to that, to that performance. And so it's kind of hard for us to, to recommend change, other than, you know, like I said, more transparency, these vary surface level things. And it's sad, we haven't been able to move past the surface level. But I definitely made sure to encourage them to, to go and meet with with people that actually have a background in this work
OGO: Which, in theory, is a reason to do this review — students don’t have access to this information, but Bond and her associates did, and could make that information about HUPD publicly available through their report. To that end, Carter Nakamoto, the Harvard student who we heard from in episode 1 and was in the same focus group as Noah, brought up that the reviewers asked some pretty substantive questions about alternatives to policing:
Carter Nakamoto: the two consultants who were there spoke more in favor of substantial revisions that they characterize less and less as being in line with what HUPD has been historically and what would be considered a police department. Like, more of the things that they suggested, by the end of the session, were in line with I would say, movements on other college campuses to shrink the role of campus police departments and close campus police departments altogether in favor of other public safety alternatives. But also not that out of line with the rhetoric of police defunding movements, suggesting that there are lots of services for which the police should not be the first responders
MNW: On the other hand, that report about HUPD from 2018 also raised a lot of concerns about the force’s transparency, and also said we should consider non-police first responders. The same concerns then resurfaced for 21CP, if they ever went away. I went about all this reporting wondering, what differentiates 21CP’s process from past reviews of HUPD? Will it lead to substantive change?
OGO: And I’d be shocked if you weren’t thinking of those questions. My gut response was also skepticism — because we know that there’s a tendency for Harvard performance reviews around race and diversity not to amount to much, or at best to be very, very slow. Especially after talking so much with Frances Frei and Daryl Smith, the two experts on diversity reviews from last episode. Sure, they were talking about diversity, not police departments, but clearly the issues are related, and both Frei and Smith described how these reviews can stall and delay, or be used for image-preservation, or have no power to implement recommendations. And those are all concerns I have for the 21CP review, as for any Harvard performance review.
MNW: They are concerns many students shared. Carter Nakamoto was pretty explicit about this:
Nakamoto: The University has a penchant for, you know, ordering reports, for conducting surveys, and then basically, filing those results away, holding a few listening sessions, perhaps with students, and then not making material changes in response to their findings [...] The reviewers didn't seem to have a good answer, or really even a new framework for how, how this review would differentiate itself, and how it would actually exert power over the administration in a way that similar past reviews have not. Yeah, I am very concerned about the likelihood that this is a cosmetic process
MNW: Let’s recall, of course, that everything Carter and Noah said was speculative — this was before 21CP released their report. But I’m inclined to agree, that given Harvard’s history of review after review after review, even before reading the recommendations there was good reason for students to have a baseline of skepticism. And to that end, a group of students and activists conducted their own review — the Harvard Alliance Against Campus Cops, who we introduced earlier.
Segment 2
Joan Steffen: So it definitely was sparked by the, by sort of seeing the specific photos of HUPD [...] And so we started meeting, I think. Not too long after that, we kind of, our group came together through like just a variety of networks of people who knew each other from other organizing efforts, other sort of leftist or abolitionist projects all across Harvard. And so yeah, we were able to come together and start meeting and came up with the idea of a report to kind of bring together a lot of the different interest areas that people came with
MNW: This is Joan Steffen, a second year law student who was one of the founding members of HAACC. As the organization’s name suggests, they came to the review process from a very different angle than Bond and 21CP Solutions. The University charged 21CP with, in broad terms, evaluating HUPD and rethinking what public safety does and should mean at Harvard. HAACC in a way was also reimagining public safety, also reacting to student outrage and fears not only at HUPD presence at Franklin Park, but also the harassment of unhoused people in Smith, of the police being called on students in the Performing Latinidad class, of a pervasive and unavoidable police presence on our campus. And they had a particular direction in mind for this reimagining, as Ife describes:
Omidiran: I think we have to understand that we have been trying and in a larger sphere beyond Harvard. We've been trying to reform police departments and to reform policing and prisons, and it hasn't worked. The history of police and prisons is a history of reform. And so one of our what we want to do is to get up this idea that police are what make us safe,
MNW: From the outset, they believe in the abolition, or at least massive shrinking, of Harvard’s, and importantly, all police forces. Fundamentally, they saw policing as a way to uphold white supremacy and property rights, of defining who should and shouldn’t receive the protection of the law, which operates along racist and class and gendered lines:
Steffen: Another piece of it really too, is just this whole idea of like the whiteness as property critique, along those lines. So, this idea that whiteness is this form of privilege and entitlement that functions, almost like a property entitlement. And we see that sort of really clearly manifested in terms of like access to the physical faces of Harvard Yard and, like we were just talking about who's seen as belonging and who isn't. And taking that sort of from the abstract to the tangible, you know, when we have this armed police force is tasked with sort of trying to make this determination of who belongs and who doesn't and are, because they're trying to make this determination are coming into contact with so many people who are perceived as not belonging, it's just putting them at such greater risk for getting involved in the criminal legal system, and ending up incarcerated. And of course like prison abolition is also a big connected very much to police abolition
MNW: This idea that policing is a function of systemic racism and protecting the property of whiteness, we might recall, was something Cornell Brooks, also told us:
Brooks rerecord: the challenge of deadly, homicidal, brutalizing policing coincides, is reinforced by, exacerbated by, the carceral state, the prison industrial complex. That is to say, literally, the growth of mass incarceration has also led to the growth of fatal and deadly policing. Mass incarceration is literally the fruit, is literally the manifestation of systemic racism on the back end, and destructive policing is a manifestation of systemic racism on the front end. So in other words, it's when people are profiled, like when people look at you, they don't see you as a person, they don't see you as a student, they don't see you as a human being. They see you literally as an object of suspicion. Or if they look at me, they don't see me as a father, a professor, a civil rights lawyer. They see me as a suspicious character. These disparities begin at the front end, in terms of surveilling, profiling, the use of databases to literally construct, like data portraits of whom the police are going to profile and surveil and arrest and harass.
OGO: We’re beginning to question the assumption that to be part of Harvard is to be special — rather, to HAACC, racism through Harvard and HUPD is not just a reflection of, but a perpetuation of, societal racism. So how did HAACC apply this theory, one grounded in histories and research on policing and racism across the country, to Harvard? 21CP’s process involved reviewing documents and holding community conversations. What about HAACC’s process?
MNW: As was mentioned earlier, HAACC is a coalition of students (and staff?) with a variety of backgrounds — so some dove into the history of HUPD, others into the finances, others into researching alternatives to police responses, others into analyzing HUPD call logs, and so on, depending on their interests and expertise. HAACC also did some research into 21CP Solutions, the group Bacow brought on to review HUPD, and saw that 21CP did a similar review of Yale’s police department a year earlier — which, to Ife, raised concerns:
Omidiran: as part of our research, we also, we did some research into the, on the reports that 21CP has produced for other institutions. And they did a pretty similar report on public safety at Yale. And we read through this report. And essentially all of their recommendations were reformist steps that did nothing to shift power away from the police. Some of the things they suggested were integrating community policing, and getting Yale’s Police Department more closely integrated with their security forces, having officers do mental health crisis intervention training, and cultural competency training, and also coordinating better with the New Haven Police Department. So while these are things that, you know, ostensibly might sound like, a good thing, like, you know, you, I could see how someone would see like cultural competency training and mental health crisis intervention training as good things because, you know, in theory, we would, if we're going to have police, we would want them to know how to handle a mental health crisis intervention. But the thing is, our argument is that there's no reason that police officers should be the ones intervening if someone is having a mental health crisis. That doesn't, that just doesn't make any sense.
MNW: Of course, the Yale report had a different charge and different reviewers and the findings would be specific to Yale, not Harvard. It’s not a perfect point of reference. But there are similarities in terms of method from the Yale and Harvard reviews, i.e. trying to represent the views of the quote-unquote ‘community.’
Omidiran: the problem isn't that HUPD and police departments in general aren't diverse enough or, you know, aren't well trained enough. The problem is the very existence of police. [...] So if this, if this report on public safety that 21CP authored for Yale kind of gives any indication into what they might suggest for Harvard's police department, it's, I mean, my thought is that it does not sound like it will be effective in getting us closer to this goal of abolition.
OGO: It seems like they kind of skipped the “listening tour,” as Smith — the diversity review expert from last episode — might call it. Smith was critical of how a University president might go on a listening tour to figure out what’s wrong, or commission a study on a toxic department, when there are already people who know, quite intimately, about that toxicity or what is wrong. Joan speaks to that:
Steffen: I think that that 21CP report put a lot more time into sort of having conversations and focus groups with current Harvard community members. We did solicit anonymous reports, or just input from students. And I mentioned that we're trying to also do this story collection from the local Cambridge community. But we didn't put as much effort into that — I think our stance was like, we are, we are students, and in a lot of ways we're the experts on how HUPD is affecting our student community. And we didn't feel like our views had to go through this sort of legitimizing process, of like a focus group that has that goes to these outside consultants to analyze the data and turn it into like a polished official document, you know. We sort of felt like we were already sort of poised to, to talk about student needs and student concerns without the, without the sort of formal effort
OGO: It seems like the students and activists who coalesced into HAACC, in many ways, are those people who know what’s wrong with policing at Harvard, and so they took what they saw as a direct approach to addressing it. This report isn’t top-down; it’s made, at least in part, by the people it’s trying to serve. We see this difference in approach and perspectives reflected in the structure of the reports, and the contextual information they provide in the reports. 21CP dedicates most of the report to the 2020 context of Black Lives Matter protests and a lot of time to their qualitative research figuring out what Harvard students’ attitudes toward police are,
MNW: Yeah, I actually followed up with Noah after 21CP released their report — he’s now the Undergraduate Council president — and he had a similar response.
Harris: When the third party is kind of diagnosing the problem. And I know they talked to several University stakeholders, but a lot of them I guess, are attributing the problem students have with HUPD, to the situation with George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and all these other injustices that we've had this summer. And why I think that, you know, it has to be, that has to be a factor, I don't really think that that is the main factor. I think issues of like, national issues around policing, while they do exist, I think, from what I've heard from students, and what I've seen myself, you have just a significant amount of like, just no transparency from HUPD, and these very much isolated issues that only seem to be negatively affecting students of color [...] they spend so much time I guess, talking about the context of the issue, and I really don't think that that's necessarily the content. Maybe that's the context they were brought on to do this job.
OGO: Whereas the HAACC members were super aware of the context Noah’s referring to because they’ve lived it. So their report opens with a declaration that police must be abolished and a lot of scholarship arguing that policing upholds white supremacy, and they devote space to alternative responses, analyzing HUPD finances, HUPD’s history, and so on.
MNW: Which is not to say they approached their report with predetermined outcomes. Just as 21CP reviewed HUPD logs and documents, the heart of the HAACC report is an analysis of what HUPD does — which we’ll get to the results of in a second — and that analysis is based on hundreds of hours spent analyzing thousands of pages of HUPD call logs. Which gets to another key difference between the HAACC and 21CP reports, quite simply, level of access.
Amanda Chan: So I knew that there were logs because of the Jeanne Clery Act, which requires universities to track the crimes that happen on campus. And even though the University may not be a public university, at the very least those daily police logs have to be publicly available.
MNW: Amanda Chan is a recent graduate of HLS. Basically, she knew about a federal law and a Massachusetts statute that require universities to keep publicly available crime logs in “in a form that can be easily understood.” So Amanda asked a friend who was good at stats to help out, and he made an algorithm that could read online PDFs of HUPD crime logs and analyze them.
Chan: But of course, the Harvard University Police Department doesn't post all of them online, just I guess, a few months at a time. And then “poof!” you know, where do the logs go?
MNW: So she got in touch with Steven Catalano, an HUPD spokesperson, and asked him to send the rest of the PDFs.
Chan: this was right in the middle of COVID. And it would have been really ridiculous for people to have to risk their lives and well being and worse the spread of a very new contagious and deadly disease. But that's what he insisted on us doing
OGO: That’s awful! And in the HAACC report there’s a screenshot of Catalano’s email — they wrote asking if there was a way for them to access the logs remotely, and he responded with one word, “No” — not a hello or a sincerely.
MNW: So Amanda and other members of the coalition masked up and went to the HUPD headquarters to go through the physical logs.
Chan: It was awkward once we, we got there, all masked up. Although I have to say not all the police officers were masked up, unfortunately. And he just let us go through the binders, the police logs, and shockingly, or not shockingly, the in-person binders looked exactly like the PDFs that were available online. And in fact, it looked almost like somebody had recently printed out all of these papers at one time and very recently went into their binders. Of course, I can't say that for sure. Because I'm not a medium. But we had a strong suspicion.
OGO: Wait, she’s implying that the logs were actually kept online, but that HUPD intentionally did not post them and claimed they were only in person — and then HAACC called their bluff, so HUPD had to scramble last minute to print out all these copies and make it look like a long-standing, hard-copy-only record log?
Chan: in the movie Gone Girl, she's faking a diary over a longer period of time. And she goes through the effort of actually burning the diary to make it seem like it had been aged and she used different pens. I don't think that effort was really used or input or implemented here, because definitely, the binders had a similar look to them. And the fact that they weren't already, by the time that we had gotten there, I mean, if you really are printing out these binders on a regular basis, regardless of whether or not people are requesting them, then they shouldn't be incomplete. They should already be complete when we get there. But they weren't.
OGO: Steven Catalano, the HUPD spokesperson, declined to comment.
Chan: So we're in the room, we're using our iPhones which are dying, you know, of battery, because that camera uses a lot of energy. And we're like, trying to charge our camera and trying to delete memories so that we can make more room for all these photos. And he's just in the room with us, just like watching us, like, I guess making sure we didn't steal the pieces of paper or something.
MNW: The logs were incomplete and disorganized, which made their task harder. And once they had the photos, the original PDF scanning algorithm didn’t work.
Chan: So we had to gather up a team of P photo transcribers to look at the text and read the text of the photos and put them into an Excel sheet for our stats guide, analyze, and that took a whole lot of time. And at first, it seemed pretty impossible to be able to transcribe all of them in time. But we did it, and not only that, we got a whole bunch of people who really really got into the intimate details of the police logs. And we really were able to catch all of the most ridiculous things that HUPD is doing all the time. For example, I'm getting called out to a suspicious flyer that turns out just advertising a band, getting called when the bathroom doors locks and nobody can get in. Because we obviously need a man with a gun instead of a locksmith to handle that situation. Someone called HUPD when there was a chemical spill in the lab, which again, I don't see how a gun will help in that situation. So even though it took a lot of time, it was very informative
MNW: Which brings us, then, to the findings — what did the HAACC and 21CP reports, both released in the span of a couple of weeks in December, determine about the Harvard University Police Department? And based on their findings, what did they recommend the University should do?
Segment 3
OGO: For all the differences in their reviews’ starting points and processes, some of the actual findings of 21CP Solutions and the Harvard Alliance Against Campus Cops — their respective answers to the question, ‘What does HUPD do?’ — have surprising commonalities. 21CP found that a lot of what HUPD currently does on campus, doesn’t actually require law enforcement to respond. Here’s Bond, the 21CP reviewer, explaining that finding:
Bond: Historically, universities have a campus policing unit that was very much like, in concept, traditional municipal police agencies. And they're, I would say that, in general, the idea of a campus police agency was sort of grounded in let's just apply our policing model to this specific community. And the first part of the report is really, I think, just a strong, a strong recognition that if that model ever worked previously, it definitely doesn't work anymore
OGO: To her point — in 21CP’s analysis of HUPD calls for service, they found that the 15 most frequent reasons for calling HUPD, things like “directed patrol” or “recovered property” — totaling 82% of all calls — do not typically involve violence and that “the nature of the call itself does not immediately or necessarily implicate that the response of a law enforcement officer is required.” We talked to Amanda as she read through this part of 21CP’s report for the first time, and she read this sentence from 21CP aloud to herself,
Amanda Chan: “at least some portion of personnel recognize that the department does not simply or even primarily prevent and address crime.” [laughter] Then what do they do?
MNW: And, as her laughter might imply, HAACC found something very similar. They analyzed all those police logs Amanda and others took photos of, which are a slightly different data set but are analogous to what 21CP had, and they found “theft reports,” “suspicious activity,” “unwanted guest,” made up the top 3 reasons for calling HUPD.
Steffen: I think that HUPD is sort of presented to students as protecting, you know, our safety, you know, sort of physical security, preventing quote unquote “crime,” things like that. What we found looking at the actual incident report is that the vast majority of what they do is property related crimes, both personal property and sort of trespass activity. So yeah, like the number one thing that that we saw on incident reports that the biggest category was theft reports, followed by suspicious activity and unwanted guests, which, of course, are all about policing the boundaries of Harvard's, like physical property.
MNW: They also did a qualitative analysis of some of these logs, which Amanda alluded to earlier, that yielded findings like HUPD responding to lab spills, lockouts, things might not need or want armed officers responding to.
OGO: My personal favorite in the HAACC report, from September 2015, is, “Officer dispatched to a report of a restroom door being locked for a substantial amount of time. Officer arrived and [sic] report door was not locked it was just stuck.”
MNW: Both of the reports arrive at the same general conclusion about HUPD’s current role on campus, which is that it doesn’t work and is too expansive — that whatever HUPD does, it’s nowhere near limited to providing for public safety. But the more specific findings of each group, the granular analysis, vary. Bond explained that a lot of the Harvard community they spoke to supported some police presence
Bond: there are actually a number of people on a college campus who appreciate some of what the police department does. And so I think, and so we heard that too, right? We heard that some people feel safer when they see a particular public safety person, whether that's securitas or, you know, the police department is obviously a conversation to be had [...] Also, to complicate things even more, there are victims of crime. Crime happens on campus. And there were victims of crime. And we heard from, from individuals who have had positive interactions with the police as a result of victimization.
MNW: It’s not that Bond and 21CP support or oppose the existence of campus cops, but because they were charged with reviewing the opinions of all of Harvard’s community, they gave room in their report to pro-HUPD voices. Whereas of the Harvard Alliance Against Campus Cops did not — it was a priori, to them, that pro-policing or reformist mindsets were part of the problem.
MNW: Ife, a member of HAACC, articulated this mindset
Omidiran: what we want to do is to get up this idea that police are what make us safe, that the reason that you should feel safe on Harvard's campus is because there are officers walking, around with guns who will go and harass a person experiencing homelessness in Harvard Square. and potentially arrested for trespassing. we want people to start interrogating that notion of safety and to interrogate why that has to be at the expense of disproportionately Black and Brown students and houseless people in Harvard Square, we also know are disproportionately Black, Brown
MNW: In the past students declared “I, Too, Am Harvard” or “Black Lives Matter at Harvard, too” — both undoubtedly important rallying cries, of course, but HAACC was changing the terms of the conversation around policing at Harvard, saying, “Harvard should protect, or at least not police, non-Harvardians, too.” When we discussed Yardfest, a lingering point was that the police should never have punched and arrested that young Black man regardless of his status as a Harvard student, but a lot of the media coverage focused on making the student out as special because he attended Harvard. HAACC members like Joan really hammered in this idea that HUPD defends property and privilege, rather than people, both of Harvard, but of white supremacist structures more generally
Steffen: It seems like the HUPD is spending most of their time sort of investigating these property crimes, which is a major source of harm for students, like I kind of mentioned before, who are perceived as not belonging, and then have to justify themselves to the police department, which is, of course, you know, a harmful experience, and towards the unhoused community, or really anyone else who is visiting campus and is just perceived as not belonging. We saw incidents related to parents or tourists or just people looking for a quiet place to pray — like that, that log really stuck with me. And then with the theft reports those are mostly going unsolved. And so police involvement in these facets isn't actually accomplishing anything
OGO: An example in the HAACC report that seemed pretty convincing, in their case that HUPD primarily polices who does and doesn’t belong on Harvard property, is that Jeffrey Epstein was able to walk through the yard 40 times even after being convicted of sex charges involving a minor, but unhoused people are harrassed by HUPD in the Smith Center, or even in the Square, regularly.
MNW: And HAACC did a lot of research beyond the scope of just how policing affects people at Harvard, looking into how Harvard police affect the surrounding Cambridge community, while 21CP’s report is focused primarily on Harvard spaces and affiliates.
Steffen: I think one thing that surprised me personally, was just the extent to which HUPD is really just terrorizing the local unhoused communities in Cambridge, and just, yeah, that the broader community outside of like Harvard students, staff and faculty, I think that's also a blind spot that I saw in the 21CP report
MNW: They were especially concerned about the mutual aid agreements that HUPD has with municipal police departments and other law enforcement agencies, which basically mean Cambridge or Boston police can ask HUPD officers for assistance. That’s what led to HUPD presence at the June 2 BLM protest, or to HUPD presence at an abolish ICE rally.
Amanda Chan: The Harvey University Police Department. I mean, don't bother calling it the Harvey University one, just call it backup Boston Police Department, honestly, but not subject to the same transparency laws because of the mutual aid agreements. They get to show up wherever Cambridge police calls them, wherever the Boston Police calls them, wherever the Massachusetts State Police calls them as, quote unquote “backup,” quote unquote “mutual aid.” Is that what you want your tuition dollars to be funding?
Steffen: We also call for HUPD to end their contracts and mutual aid agreements with the Cambridge police department and the Boston Police Department. This is really important to us, because of the ways that our funding, as students, of the Harvard University Police, is then going towards these really oppressive and violent police tactics, and repressing protesters and putting down the uprisings that we saw this summer. So that, that's really fundamental to us. And the, the 21CP report, by contrast, calls for reexamining these agreements and sort of allowing HUPD to bow out of assignments or tasks that don't align with University values. It's unclear to me what that means necessarily.
OGO: One of the biggest points of divergence I’m seeing also relates to Cambridge police. If we recall, in 2018 it was Cambridge police officers who tackled, punched, and arrested a Black Harvard undergraduate. Here’s Bond
Bond: Some people said I would rather have Harvard University Police Department in a new and improved form, protecting, like taking care of me and ensuring my safety, than I would Cambridge
MNW: To which I might respond, CPD responding to and policing Harvard students is the status quo — the Yardfest incident shows that Cambridge police are already threatening Harvard students. But more fundamentally, Joan basically responded to this criticism of HUPD abolition by saying abolition isn’t just about removing, but about reenvisioning — so you get rid of HUPD and replace it with resources like a student-run EMS, mental health professionals, night escorts, property insurance, etc., that mean students would never be in a situation requiring CPD. Joan again:
Steffen: When we implement these alternatives, they really need to be backed up by resources, staffing, you know, to be able to fully meet the needs of our community so that we don't have to rely on calling in the Cambridge Police Department
OGO: There are a lot of differences between these reports, yes. But they might be a product of 21CP’s role as a supposedly neutral third party, to learn about the perspectives of as many people as possible, so they included favorable views about police presence, whereas HAACC had a position in mind when they started: police are always bad. But that emphasis on outreach and community that Bond talked about also meant 21CP engaged and even agreed with more abolitionist approaches. They devote a lot of time to discussing why “community policing” doesn’t seem like a good approach anymore, which is very in line with HAACC. Here’s Amanda, from HAACC:
Chan: Think about what the word community policing means. What it means, essentially, at Harvard, is that Harvard police officers get to go and hang out in areas where they didn't get to go before
OGO: 21CP basically agreed, writing that “Many made clear that the adoption of this broader conception of ‘community policing’ may not align with how many within the University community want to be policed going forward. A police department that comprehensively implements community policing “embraces a broad view of the police function rather than a narrow focus on crime fighting or law enforcement.’” They even explicitly engaged the abolitionist stance,
Bond: We recognize that in the report that there are groups on campus that want to defund the police, that don't want to police department there
MNW: The report concludes that there is common ground between all parties interested in changing police, whether that’s community policing or abolition — hence their key recommendation, which is for Harvard to have a community driven discussion to reimagine public safety. They wrote, “This report refers to the objective and process of systematically examining and considering transformation to the ways that a community provides for its security and well-being as “re-imagining public safety” – even as this term itself is increasingly becoming just as capable of meaning dramatically different things to different people as “community policing” or “defunding police.””
OGO: And so now we have to ask — 21CP Solutions spent several months evaluating and reviewing the Harvard University Police Department. Their central recommendation, which they call “pillar 1,” consists of reimagining public safety. Or more specifically Harvard, quote, “should engage in a community-driven, stakeholder-informed process of defining what ‘public safety’ is at Harvard and re-imagining how it can best be achieved.” Behind all the jargon, what would that look like?
Segment 4
MNW: So we’ve compared many of the core findings of HAACC and 21CP. Now we’re on to the recommendations: What is to be done? Here’s how Bond described their key recommendation, or pillar one, to me:
Bond: The second part of that first pillar is the community needs to decide. And so we recommend that the community take deliberate steps to define and then operationalize what community safety and well being should look like at Harvard University. So Harvard University is unique. I may not be able to say that about every university, but Harvard University is unique in what it does, what it represents. The impact that it has, the global reach. Also the very complicated history that comes with Harvard University. And there's an opportunity which we try to encourage in this first pillar, to really, literally reimagine what campus safety and well being means.
OGO4.27: Her response doesn’t add much clarity.
Steffen: That section of the 21CP report was also interesting. So the first, the number one recommendation, right, which calls for this sort of reexamining of, of defining public safety for Harvard, reimagining how to achieve it, you know, that, that sounds pretty good, I'll say — you know, this idea of getting input and reimagining Harvard's role and possibly shifting their responsibilities to non police entities on campus, you know. But, I mean, that was also the part of the report that was just the least definitive, the least-well fleshed out, you know, sort of open ended and aspirational.
MNW: Agreed, it’s open-ended and aspirational, which was the point — pillar 1 breaks down into several steps that outline a framework Bond and her fellow reviewers think Harvard should follow in getting input from all community members to chart a path forward on public safety, whether that means community policing or abolishing HUPD or something else entirely. They call for Harvard to make a “Facilitating Group” to lead this process, which they call to be as diverse as possible, and then they outline steps to make sure the group acts quickly and with transparency.
OGO: Pillar 1 seems like the least divisive take on one of the most divisive issues in the U.S.: they’re saying, let’s just wait and hear what everyone has to say. For a necessarily complicated issue, 21CP sort of trying to please everyone, at least everyone on this relatively liberal college campus.
MNW: And if we consider another relatively liberal college campus, Yale, the 21CP Solutions review of Yale’s police department made a very similar recommendation to the Harvard review: pillar one was “reimagining public safety at Yale” and they recommend a “community-driven, collaborative process to formulate a new Public Safety Vision.” — language super similar to the Harvard review of a, quote, “community-driven, stakeholder-informed process of defining what ‘public safety’ is at Harvard.”
Chan: Every time there is an investigation to be held by a university who doesn't actually want to make any material change, but wants to release a report to make it look like they're doing something, they just have like, like, like a mad libs where they have the same buzzwords over and over again and then they just control-avid-input “Harvard,” because all the reports are the same. Every single year another report comes out about policing this, policing that, and nothing ever changes. Sometimes we give more money to the police by diversity training, but nothing ever changes
OGO: And in either case pillar 1 just sounds like another review. to that end, in an interview in December, University Executive VP Katherine Lapp said, “Harvard will create two groups to pick up the important work this review has started.” They expected to announce the facilitating committee at the end of April, but have since said it will be in the fall. Here’s Noah’s reaction to that:
Harris: In setting up other other forms of review, and saying, we need to think about this more, and we need to create a focus group based off of the two review boards that we create, and I think, you know, that's what a lot of students are, are fearful of, I guess, reviews and reports like this. Because, you know, we see that, we see the problems that exist. And it's not, it's not the hardest thing to come up with with some of the solutions. Like for a number of these, you don't really need to study, I guess, police around the country to know that police should probably not be the first responders for everything that they are currently, like, no lockout and, and mental health issues.
MNW: And these proliferating reviews might be an especially big problem for changing police departments. I asked Cornell Brooks, former NAACP head and long-time advocate for police transformation and abolition, about this:
Brooks: Harvard has a history of encountering various challenges when it comes to policing, most recently, the arrest of homeless people, students being treated unfairly at the hands of the police, the participation of Harvard police in this recent anti racism protests [...] in the wake of these various challenges, they've been various commitments to do new reports, to make new assessments, to conduct evaluations. And you've asked the question, so how effective is that, with respect to Harvard, and how effective is it with respect to what's happening in the country more broadly? So my answer would be, would be this, that this is a long and disturbingly familiar pattern of policing crisis, followed by calls for police reform and transformation, followed by police task forces, commission evaluations, audits, and reports. In many instances, these assessments reports, task force and commissions, lead to recommendations, lead to occasionally reform referrals, a statutory, regulatory construction, but not necessarily reform and transformation. And the reasons for that were several, the first of which is studying the problem can lead to what Martin Luther King called the paralysis of analysis, meaning you study it, and because you study it, it leads to further study, more study, expanded study, but no action — paralysis of analysis.
OGO: It’s funny that the 21CP report actually explicitly recognizes this tendency to run down the clock. There’s a line that reads, “we are mindful that, as one faculty member wryly observed, Harvard’s ‘cultural response is to do “further study.”’ And in response to a request for comment, 21CP wrote in an email that they did not recommend a review, but a highly detailed process for how Harvard can transparently and quickly reimagine public safety in line with community values. As we said earlier, the subsections of pillar 1 explain how this reimagining can be quick and transparent. And Bond really emphasized the community part.
Bond: You’ve got thousands of people on this campus who are stakeholders in this community [...] I've been involved in municipal government, municipal community engagement processes, they are extremely complex and difficult to pull off, and it takes time. So the alternative would be that the University turns around and says, we're going to do this, and we're not going to engage the community. And my sense is that that might also create a lot of angst and frustration about not being involved in the process. So while I understand the, the skepticism that comes from the recommendation like this, the alternative is that the that it's top down, and there are a lot of problems with top down
OGO: But what if nobody at the top is listening when people at the ground level are speaking? Like the student Hilda Jordan told us in episode 1 about protesting police violence
Hilda Jordan: ...really feeling it with every fiber of my body and starting to cry because I truly felt like I was just crying to the institution to have them care for us
OGO: We’ve heard students speak out about safety and well-being in 2018, about inclusion and belonging in 2014. There was another review of HUPD in 2009, which we’ll get to later — it’s over 100 pages and super thorough. This dates all the way back to the Third World Students movement from the 1970s. Every four years, the students graduate. And every several years, it seems, concerns over race and diversity recur. So I agree, we don’t want a top-down solution, but it also doesn’t seem like something from the bottom-up is, at least empirically speaking, realistic.
MNW: That being said, there is a second pillar to the 21CP report, which includes five short-term recommendations. They write, “To ensure progress and accountability, HUPD should adopt a plan for fully implementing these recommendations within, at most, two years and as rapidly as possible within those two years.” So that is urgency. Once again, though, 21CP has no power — Lapp said Harvard’s making a different committee to consider those short-term recommendations. So another review, of sorts.
Bond: The University community will have to figure out how they hold the University leadership accountable for making something happen, right. It's not under the realm of any external reviewer to do that, unless that's part of the agreement. And so in some ways, folks like yourself, and others who are very active in sort of thinking about life at Harvard, need to identify those ways in which you can try to hold the university accountable to do something. So I know, that sounds maybe a little bit like the party line. But that's, who else will do that if the University community doesn't do that?
MNW: Which was, in some ways, precisely why HAACC formed — not just to hold the University accountable, but to force its hand. It doesn’t make recommendations, but demands — a few of which we’ve heard already — and those demands are very different from either 21CP’s first or second pillars. The demands of the Harvard alliance against campus cops, and the short-term recommendations of 21CP Solutions, are coming next time, on Under Review.
Abolish HUPD Protest: Today, we assemble outside the University-financed home, insured no doubt with slave money, of Larry Bacow to call for the complete and immediate abolition of the Harvard University Police Department.

About Under Review:
How can Harvard, an institution with so much history, have so little memory?
The racial reckonings and Black Lives Matter protests that swept the country this past summer brought attention to a trend in how Harvard seems to deal with student activism and concerns surrounding race, racism, and diversity: to commission a diversity review. These committees and reports long predate this summer, and reading them it can seem, at times, like some things have not changed at the University — in race relations, Harvard’s review process, or the findings and recommendations. What can these diversity reviews accomplish, and what can’t they?
“Under Review” is a podcast from The Harvard Crimson, hosted by Matteo Wong and Olivia Oldham, chairs of The Crimson’s weekly magazine, Fifteen Minutes. Each week, they will explore controversies and diversity reviews stretching across 40 years of Harvard history, speaking to dozens of students, activists, experts, and more, to try and understand how the Harvard diversity review works — or doesn’t.

In the final episode of Under Review, hosts Matteo Wong and Olivia Oldham continue to put competing reviews of racism and the Harvard police head-to-head, returning to the question: How can an institution with so much history have so little memory?

OGO: Previously, on Under Review:
Hilda M. Jordan: Black Lives Matter, at Harvard, too. Black lives matter! Black lives matter!
Cornell W. Brooks: studying the problem can lead to what martin luther king called the paralysis of analysis,
Brenda Bond: we say tell us, community, tell us what you think safety looks like or what makes you feel safe.
Ife Omidiran: what we want to do is to get up this idea that police are what make us safe, that the reason that you should feel safe on Harvard's campus is because there are officers walking, around with guns
MNW and OGO: We’re standing in front of 1033 Mass Ave, a tall, square, concrete building that’s almost brutalist. It’s facade is a grid, with big rectangular windows, like a parking garage. The windows look tinted from afar, but up close they’re just really, really dirty. We’re in front, and sniffing the chemical aroma, of a Domino’s pizza, but we’re interested in the glass door next to Domino’s, and in the offices behind the grimy windows on the sixth floor of this parking-garage-esque structure, doors and windows not many Harvard students have seen the other side of. A sign on the glass door reads: Harvard University Police, Sixth Floor.
MNW: I’m Matteo Wong
OGO: And I’m Olivia Oldham. This is the second part in the two-episode finale of Under Review, a podcast from Fifteen Minutes, the Crimson’s weekly magazine, in which we investigate what we’re calling “the Harvard Diversity Review.”
MNW: Over the past four episodes we’ve explored how this university responds to issues of race, racism, and diversity — primarily with task forces and committees, which issue diversity reviews and reports. The pattern stretches back to the 1970s, when Harvard first had appreciable numbers of nonwhite students, and has continued in Harvard’s sweeping statements and reviews about diversity in the past three years. In our final episode, we’re subjecting those sweeping task forces to a specific test: enormous debates over policing and racism at Harvard sparked by the sighting of Harvard University Police Department officers at a Black Lives Matter rally in June 2020.
Abolish HUPD Protest: Even closer to home, we know about the Harvard police being called in as reinforcements to intimidate protestors in Boston who filled the streets to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade, and George Floyd.
OGO: We’d love to go behind the grimy windows of the sixth floor of 1033 Mass Ave, into the inner workings of the HUPD — but we can’t, so we’re doing the next best thing, exploring the efforts of two groups, to systematically review the HUPD. One group was a consulting firm hired by the University, called 21CP Solutions, short for 21st Century Policing Solutions.= The other group is a coalition of abolitionist students and activists called the Harvard Alliance Against Campus Cops, or HAACC. Both reviews began after the sighting of Harvard police at the BLM rally last June, and both published their reports in december of 2020. If you haven’t listened to the previous episode, we’d recommend doing so and then coming back.
MNW: As a quick recap, last episode we looked at differences, but also surprising similarities, between the 21CP and HAACC reports. 21CP and HAACC agreed that the current model of HUPD policing doesn’t work, and that the Harvard police take on a lot of responsibilities you don’t need armed officers for. HAACC, a group of abolitionists, doesn’t think policing is broken, per se — they see Harvard police harassing Black, brown, and unhomed people as exactly what policing, as a manifestation of structural racism, is intended to do. So they call for defunding and abolishing. Meanwhile the university-hired consultants 21CP recommended, in pillar 1 of their review, that Harvard engage a community-wide process to reimagine public safety, which to many sounds like another review — and we’re left with the question, how do we make sure that process leads to tangible change? As a student, Carter Nakamoto, told us last time,
Carter Nakamoto: The University has a penchant for, you know, ordering reports, for conducting surveys, and then basically, filing those results away, holding a few listening sessions, perhaps with students, and then not making material changes in response to their findings
MNW: And Brenda Bond, one of the 21CP Solutions reviewers, said
Bond: the University community will have to figure out how they hold the university leadership accountable for making something happen [...] that sounds maybe a little bit like the party line. But that's, who else will do that if the university community doesn't do that?
OGO: In many ways the Harvard Alliance Against Campus Cops seeks to do just that, to force the University’s hand to rapidly reimagine, or for HAACC, eliminate policing — they are not satisfied with a slow, bigger conversation over public safety because they have an answer. To their credit, 21CP Solutions, in their report, acknowledged Harvard’s tendency to delay and study. So the 21CP report has a second section, titled pillar 2, in which they recommend five areas in which the University should make short term changes to the HUPD in a two-year window — and that second pillar suggests urgency.
MNW: It’s hard to compare the specific and immediate demands of HAACC with the very broad and capacious recommendation from 21CP to reimagine public safety — we have no clue what such a reimagining will lead to. But we can compare HAACC’s demands with 21CP’s pillar 2, the short-term reforms. In this episode, we attempt a final accounting: What are HAACC’s precise, immediate demands of the University? What are 21CP’s short-term recommendations? If we scry into the past, at Harvard’s oft-forgotten but incredibly long history, have any of these been tried before? How do HAACC’s demands, or 21CP’s pillar 2, fit into a broad reimagining of public safety?
OGO: And how does this all fit into conversations about abolition versus reform, about reviewing the problem versus immediate change, and about the scale of reimagining the University in relation to race, racism, and diversity — And ultimately who do these reviews of the HUPD, and diversity reviews more generally, help? Coming up, on Under Review:
Segment 1
OGO: The central demand of the Harvard Alliance Against Campus Cops, as the name suggests, is defunding the Harvard police. This is Joan Steffen, a law school student who worked on the HAACC report, who we heard from last time:
Joan Steffen: So our first demand is to defund HUPD with a budget cut of at least 80%. I guess, in terms of comparing to the 21CP report, there's no mention of funding that I noticed in terms of cutting funding to HUPD. So even though there's sort of these, like suggestions that maybe services could be shifted to other other institutions or other University resources, there's not necessarily this demand that that the police department's budget be cut to reflect that. And that's concerning, because I've seen, you know, a lot of my work, I mentioned, is in sort of prison abolition, and Massachusetts has one of the lowest prison populations per capita, but one of the highest spending rates. And I think we've seen the same problem with police departments across the country where you know, rates of community harm defined as crime are falling, but police budgets are going up and up and up. So I think that's something that we wanted to really explicitly have in our report, is cutting the funding.
OGO: The closest 21CP’s second pillar of two-year solutions gets to defunding… well, it doesn’t. To defund HUPD is so drastic that it seems 21CP would only want that if the community process to reimagine public safety from pillar 1 concluded that defunding is what the Harvard community wants. As Bond, the 21CP reviewer, told us, about defunding:
Bond: That's a conversation that the university community needs to have, we can’t prescribe the best solution. What we can do is say, here are some things that you should really be thinking about and talking about. And obviously you’ll see that in our recommendation to have broader community conversations about how to define and operationalize community safety and well being.
MNW: The second HAACC demand we mentioned last episode — to end mutual aid agreements with municipal police — basically these agreements that let cambridge and boston police call on HUPD for assistance, which is what led to harvard bicycle patrol officers at that black lives matter rally in june. While 21CP calls for updating those agreements to reflect University values — which doesn’t really mean anything concrete and sounds a bit little like another review. Which, maybe, is the point.
OGO: HAACC’s next two demands are to disarm the Harvard police and to disclose all HUPD records, that is, full transparency.
Steffen: Our next demand is to disarm HUPD. I think that just gets to like the power that they have as the police department and the threat that they pose to students, the threat of violence from them as police officers. There's almost no reason that Harvard police officers should be armed while patrolling campus, while sitting in the dining hall, etcetera. It's just completely ridiculous.
OGO: Although 21CP doesn’t explicitly write, “disarm the HUPD,” the report remarks that armed officers in student dining halls is “an example of HUPD engagement efforts being identified not only as failing to further positive community relationships but as harmful and damaging to the HUPD-community dynamic.” Maybe it’s not unreasonable to think that 21CP’s temporary recommendation 2.2.1, updating the HUPD Policies & Guidelines Manual, could encompass something at least relevant to disarming police in certain contexts. Or maybe that is unreasonable — updating policies could be as trivial as modified guidelines for student interaction. 21CP Solutions, in response to requests for comment, referred us back to specific parts of their review. HUPD spokesperson steven catalano again declined to comment, and University spokespeople have declined to comment on-the-record throughout our reporting. Back to Joan, from HAACC:
Steffen: The next request is to disclose the records, so for more transparency. This is something that was also called for in the 21CP report. But without, I think I said before, you know, there's not really like a clear definition in that report of what exactly should be made publicly available.
OGO: And we can recall how, in order to write their report, HAACC really came up against the blackbox of HUPD. We want to metaphorically get behind the windows of HUPD headquarters, but in the middle of a pandemic, members like Amanda Chan did not want to have to actually go there to access HUPD records — except, they did:
Amanda Chan: This was right in the middle of COVID. And it would have been really ridiculous for people to have to risk their lives and well being and worse, the spread of a very new contagious and deadly disease. But that's what he insisted on us oing
MNW: The HUPD spokesperson, Steven Catalano, required HAACC to come to the HUPD headquarters because he said the records could only be accessed physically. In theory HAACC members should agree with the 21CP report on transparency. 21CP devotes an entire one of the five areas of short-term changes to transparency and data sharing. But to Joan, these measures in 21CP’s report, like a dashboard with statistics or more public data on calls for service, fall short:
Steffen: I think that both the 21CP report calls for this, and then Katie Lapp in her interview says that they're going to be setting up an HUPD dashboard with sort of data about how HUPD is spending its time, whether the incident reports and then some information about internal reviews or internal complaints. That aggregate data to us again, it's not enough. Like I said before, it's hard to get a sense of how legitimate these reports are and what sort of utility they're really serving or not serving our community with that sort of aggregate level data.
MNW: I will say that 21CP’s report, although it doesn’t provide details on the exact ways HUPD should be more transparent or what the dashboard should look like, does stress the importance of being timely and specific in the info and data HUPD shares
MNW: We know that as of the end of March, Harvard had formed a 13 person committee to consider these short term changes, and that they’ve started meeting. In an interview with the Harvard Gazette, interim Harvard police chief Denis Downing said the dashboard should come out in a couple of months.
OGO: Which is promising — but also feels like such a bare minimum. The University is exposing the problem, at best. But going from a dashboard to policy changes is much harder — especially if it’s true, as Joan thinks, that the more general statistics likely to be made publicly available won’t be all that useful. Like we heard a couple of episodes ago, when we talked to experts in diversity in higher education like Daryl Smith and Francis Frei, identifying the problem, even exposing the problem, cannot be allowed to substitute for solving the problem.
MNW: On the other hand, we might recall how Noah Harris, the president of the Undergraduate Council, harvard’s student government, said that in focus groups with 21CP, since there is so little transparency with HUPD, he wasn’t able to provide very much specific feedback:
Noah Harris: it's kind of hard for us to, to recommend change, other than, you know, like I said, more transparency, these vary surface level things
MNW: and so maybe we can finally get beyond that, maybe at least some data sharing from HUPD means students, if they want to hold Harvard accountable, don’t need to embark on a months long, possibly life threatening journey like Joan and Amanda and HAACC did.
OGO: Although, there is that controversy from the end of this past March, in which a postdoc in the math department said HUPD officers questioned and detained him, telling him he was not free to go, but then described the interaction on the HUPD call log as a “field interview” — which to him seemed pretty inaccurate, although HUPD spokesperson steven catalano defended the term on technical grounds. So even when data is reported, when HUPD supposedly adheres to transparency regulations like the Clery Act that requires these call logs to be made public, transparency feels inadequate.
MNW: Right, like no matter how much we think we know, A) there are unknown unknowns, and B) knowledge isn’t action. Which I guess is part of why HAACC makes so many specific and ground-shaking recommendations, some of which go way outside the bounds of 21CP’s report:
Joan Steffen: Our next demand is to redistribute the HUPD budget to community members. So to redistribute that money to members of the Harvard community and to members of the unhoused community [...] we're also calling to open the gates to Harvard Yard. Because that's really fundamental. Like I think I've talked a lot on this in this conversation about how one of the major problems with how httpd certainly functions is sort of determining who belongs and who doesn't policing the boundaries of our campus. Just shifting that role to someone else like securitas is not going to solve that problem. It's just going to change the form that it takes. So we think it's important to just make our public spaces available to all and sort of stuff, this whole idea of policing boundaries, and just trying to make a determination of who is or isn't allowed to space.
OGO: So these two recommendations — redistributing the budget and opening the gates — are about what HAACC in their analysis saw as, to use Joan’s terms from last episode, the HUPD’s “terrorizing” of the Cambridge community. I spoke to Hannah O’Halloran, who is the Emergency Shelter Services Manager at the Somerville Homeless Coalition. She relayed this story that an unhoused community member who often sleeps in Harvard Square told her:
Hannah O’Halloran: One specific thing that this individual pointed out to me, he called it, I think he called it “The Receipt Rule.” And I asked him to elaborate, and he said that if you are homeless, and you're riding around Harvard, you need to have a receipt for the bike that you're on. Because our police officer will stop you and ask you for a receipt. And if you don't have it, then they will possibly arrest you for the bike not being yours.
OGO: HAACC’s is a vision expanding way beyond Harvard — to make all space public is to tackle the foundations of private property, and the property of whiteness, that their abolitionist vision works against. 21CP Solutions does write two paragraph about Harvard police and surrounding communities, their very last recommendation, which is to develop “tangible initiatives aimed at responses to external visitors or members of the surrounding community”
MNW: Which is at least hopeful — it might mean no more profiling of Black people in the Smith Center, for instance — but is very different from HAACC’s radical demand to open the gates. Even the language of “External visitors” or “surrounding community” still implies an inside and outside of Harvard, that the HUPD should tolerate the external world, but not necessarily that we should radically change what we consider inside and outside. It strikes me that HAACC’s vision in these demands, like opening the gates or redistirbuting HUPD funds — those get at the “core” processes, to use Daryl Smith’s terms from our third episode — they would involve fundamental changes to Harvard as an institution.
OGO: And HAACC’s final recommendation is also at the core, in which they suggest alternatives to the HUPD, including civilian response initiatives — because as we’ve mentioned in previous episodes, abolition is not just about defunding but also building something new.
Steffen: The last thing we call for is sort of these civilian response initiatives. We want Harvard to do more research about these and implementing them. We did have some ideas.
OGO: Some of their recommendations include expanding the student-run EMS service so police would never respond to medical emergencies, creating non-police safety escorts, and property insurance — that last idea, stolen property insurance, coming from statistics on HUPD’s website that 95 percent of crime on campus is property crime and that from HAACC’s research, the HUPD has a low success rate on resolving those. These recommendations aren’t out of line with a lot of what 21CP recommends, but they tend to go a few steps further in terms of specificity, like HAACC referencing other schools and cities with what they think are good models and focusing more on eliminating any police involvement.
Steffen: We specifically call for in-house residential therapists in the dorms to be those first responders in those situations. I think, I think the terms of what the University implements in that area, like the recommendations in the 21CP report, it’s a little bit vague. It's not clear if that person would be linked to say, like the Harvard disciplinary process, or what their sort of reporting obligations would be, etcetera. And, yeah, we're specifically calling for enhanced residential therapists for those problems. We're also calling one area that 21CP didn't talk about. [...] a form of harm in our community that the police are particularly ill suited to address, sexual assault on campus. So we specifically call for a sexual assault, non-mandatory reporting hotline and the creation of a discreet intervenors team to, not just for sexual assault, but to be able to appear and intervene in situations that require deescalation or moving someone to safety while sort of alleviating the threat of punishment for legal activities or retaliation. We also want a student run EMS service [...] 21 CP also called for having medical responders only for these issues. But they didn't really lay out specifics.
MNW: The consistent theme seems to be that, for the Harvard Alliance Against Campus Cops, the 21CP Solutions pillar 2 of short-term changes might not go far enough. That they are what abolitionists call “reformist,” not shrinking the criminal justice system but tinkering with it.
Steffen: Recommendation 2.5.3 is that they should consider how it might integrate existing campus community resources into its current deployment and response approaches. And they give CAMHS and Securitas as examples. And that is absolutely the wrong focus, in terms of trying to make HUPD more connected to these groups that are responding, right. That's like an anti abolitionists proposed approach, right — that's expanding the scope of HUPD.
MNW: And this tinkering is something Cornell Brooks, an HKS professor and former head of the NAACP, who we’ve heard from a few times on this podcast, noted as one problem with trying to reform police in the past
Brooks: This notion that we can fix policing with technocratic solutions, right. So in other words, if we just have more training, more tools, more data, we can turn our policing around. I want to suggest to you that we have tried this in a variety of contexts, and it's failed.
OGO: There’s somewhat of a tension in 21CP Solutions’ report, between the technocratic reform in pillar 2 and the broad reimagining of public safety in pillar 1. Pillar 2 is not reimagining HUPD, but tinkering with its current form and in some ways enhancing it, while pillar 1 offers the opportunity to start with a clean slate. But that broader pillar 1 of 21CP, which is literally a structural reimagining, seems so, as Joan put it last episode,
Steffen: open-ended and aspirational
OGO: And Joan simultaneously saw hope in this broader reimagining process 21CP recommended, but also worried such a reimagining is so open ended that it implies more and more reviews that might take a long time. And so HAACC demands the reimagining of public safety at Harvard, also, but in a specific way
MNW: Alright, but if we think about how HAACC’s demands to defund, disarm, open the gates also entail reimagining the meaning of public safety — they are concrete demands, not open-ended, as you said — they might be just as aspirational as 21CP’s vision to “reimagine public safety.” I just don’t see the University any time soon defunding its police department by 100%, or 80%, or even 40%. And so we’re pointing out this tension between small reforms to HUPD and bigger structural changes to how we define safety and property. But for Bond, there was no tension. It’s about thinking in the short and long term:
Bond: The reality is that right now, you and Harvard University have a police department. And the University needs to decide whether or not they want to address some of the identified challenges or weaknesses in the existing unit. So if they don't do anything about any of those things right now, but they literally jump right into and invest heavily in pillar one, then those, those issues are still existing and remaining. So they're not fixing those things. So is that something that the University wants to do, right? And so and I can't, I'm not going to answer that question. Because the reality is, you have a unit. And if you decide that you're keeping that unit right now, while you're trying to engage in and facilitate this reimagining process, what are the kinds of things that you can do with that unit right now?
MNW: To that end, Noah Harris, the UC president, unlike members of HAACC, liked the second pillar more than the first pillar, because to him the first pillar was just too broad, it didn’t do anything.
Harris: I think the better part is probably the second pillar that kind of gets at what HUPD couldn't be doing better. I kind of wish the maybe the report spent more time on that
MNW: Noah is on the 13 person committee that started meeting at the end of March to consider implementing some of these short-term and other changes to HUPD that we mentioned earlier. In his interview with the gazette, chief downing said, “we continue to have a shared conversation with community members, and with advice from 21CP Solutions, on what types of calls the HUPD should respond to, and how this could change from what we’ve been doing up until now” — which seems promising in terms of reimagining or shrinking HUPD’s role.
OGO: I guess part of the concern about pillar 2 and short-term reforms is, if these small and seemingly technocratic solutions, updating guidelines and diversity trainings and diverse hiring practices, that the 21CP short-term changes consist of, seem reformist and cautious, is there much hope that this big reimagining public safety process will go further? Here’s Bond again:
Bond: I don't have all the answers. But I'm very comfortable with that. Because we all have very different experiences and different ways of thinking about it. And this is where we get the good answers.
OGO: Well, here’s one answer that’s being floated: In that interview with the harvard gazette, interim HUPD chief Downing also said that he wants HUPD officers to get to know the students better, to be more closely connected with the Harvard community, which is explicitly anti-abolitionist. If we accept these technocratic changes as stop-gap measures, maybe that closes off our imaginations to the possibility of abolition or limits other ways we might redefine safety and well-being in the long term. Instead, we might end up studying and reviewing and getting mired in improving the current system. Brooks also speaks to this:
Brooks: the study of the problem can in some ways, reinforce the problem, meaning when we study the problem, and the and the study leads to a call for more resources, more tools, more financial resources
MNW: So maybe the system’s been broken so long that we need something big, unprecedented, to shake it up right now. And a lot of HAACC’s recommendations, like expanding student run emergency medical services, both don’t call for more policing resources and seem feasible in the short-term. The abolitionist group’s mindset, of urgently needing radical change, might be the difference between HAACC and 21CP: the Harvard Alliance Against Campus Cops, in fact, did a very thorough review of the history of Harvard police, and the history of what they see as failed attempts to reform the HUPD, and that heavily informed the shape, tone, and urgency of their demands to abolish the police
Steffen: I think that Historical Review is also really important. And it gives us more insight, honestly, than some 21CP findings — for example, some of their recommendations are things that have been tried in the past and have failed.
Segment 2
OGO: The Yard Police were established sometime in the 1890s, and by 1913, a few officers were employed by the University, working out of the basement of Thayer.
Steffen: The Harvard — the original members of the Harvard police force were, were formed as like a yard patrol, to patrol Harvard Yard and again, doing that same exact function of determining who belongs and who doesn't, and who can be present in that space and who can't.
OGO: The way that Joan sees it, the history of the Harvard University Police Department can be split into three themes. The first theme, to use the language of HAACC, is how HUPD has historically protected property, in part by regulating who can and cannot be on campus. We heard Joan describe this last time:
Steffen: So this idea that whiteness is this form of privilege and entitlement that functions almost like a property entitlement. And we see that sort of really clearly manifested in terms of like access to the physical spaces of Harvard Yard. [...] And, and taking that sort of, from the abstract to the tangible, you know, when when we have this armed police force, who's tasked with sort of trying to make this determination of who belongs and who doesn't
OGO: The HAACC report found that in the 1920s, HUPD officers began writing parking tickets and towing cars. HUPD caught a lot of flack for this, because it wasn’t clear whether they even had the power to this. Meanwhile — as a recent Fifteen Minutes staff writer, Simon j. Levien, explored in his piece, ‘The Crimson Klan’ — students were parading through the Yard wearing Ku Klux Klan paraphernalia.
MNW: That’s horrible. It makes you think: Those donning KKK robes quote-unquote ‘belong’ on campus, and at the same time, HUPD devotes its energies towards parking tickets. And we see this tendency repeat itself, of the HUPD policing the boundaries of who is or isn’t a member of the Harvard community — and assuming those who don’t belong are “threats.”
Steffen: So one really interesting story that I knew nothing about was about a group, a collective of women, in 1971, who occupied a Harvard building for 10 days and turned it into the Liberated Women's Center, where they were demanding affordable housing for the predominantly Black Riverside community in Cambridge. That is really, really cool. And something I never knew about.
OGO: The Liberated Women’s Center released a set of demands in their occupation of the building, including to turn the building into housing for lower-income Cambridge residents and demanded that Harvard develop a women’s center. A few days later, the group caught wind that HUPD was going to raid the building, and fled. Though the threat ended up being empty — HUPD showed up in smaller numbers than expected — the Women’s Center was no more.
In the Crimson the next day, the HUPD police chief said that if there had been a bust "It would have been the Cambridge police, with our assistance on the outside."
Steffen: And I think that has sort of been like, echoed over the years, and sort of the effect that Harvard has had on the larger Cambridge community. There's an incident, for example, in the 80s, where Harvard, the Harvard Police Department arrested eight Black youths and held them without allowing them to call their parents. And that was, of course, challenged by the Cambridge community, and the outcome of that investigation, and HUPD was dismissed.
MNW: HUPD has played a big part in policing the local community since as early as 1971, if not later. Since Harvard is in the middle of Cambridge, policing Harvard has also meant policing Cambridge spaces and residents, whether it means involving themselves in this building occupation, which demanded low-income housing, or by arresting young Black people in the community in the 80s.
OGO: The boundaries of Harvard aren’t clearly marked by its gates, it seems, at least when it comes to policing. And that policing of boundaries sometimes turns against Harvard’s own students — I’m thinking of an incident in 2007 that started the “I Am Harvard” protest — the same protest that spawned the “I, Too, Am Harvard” play in 2014, which spawned the Harvard College Working Group. “I Am Harvard” was defined by a question of who belongs on Harvard’s campus and how HUPD mediates that.
Brian Barnhil: My name is Brian Barnhill Harvard class of 2008.
OGO: In 2007, Brian was the president of the Black Men’s Forum.
Barnhill: And there was somewhat of a tradition that we would engage in and do a joint event with our sister organization called the Association of Black Harvard Women, affectionately known as ibwa. So, during reading period, we would do a field day. And this was, you know, a couple of hours that we would spend together. Don in our BMS and ABA paraphernalia t shirts, and we would take a moment to have a, an aside from the rigors of reading period to, you know, innocently have a day of relay races.
OGO: The group had gotten permission to host the event on the quad, had jumped through all the bureaucratic hoops. Yet in the middle of the activities, a member of the black men’s forum called Brian and told him that a heated email debate was going on on the Cabot House mailing list.
Barnhill: And it was initiated by an individual who said that there were some strange people on our lawn. Creating a disruption. And now mind you I live in the Quad.
Barnhill: But shortly after that call a police officer came up on a motorcycle. And I believe my social secretary talked to the officer. And, you know, just informed the officer that we were Harvard students. I think the officer could tell that we were just based upon our T-shirts, and the officer left. So there was, there was no issue with the officer whatsoever.
Barnhill: And, you know, the thing that was annoying and frustrating for us was that just a day prior, there was an impromptu gathering of students who also live in the quad, who were all white.
OGO: So, even though the incident didn’t escalate with the HUPD officer, there was this element of them being in charge of evaluating who belongs and who doesn’t.
MNW: And we see this play out today in all of the data in HAACC’s report, or highly visible incidents of HUPD harassing unhoused people in Smith, or the 2019 incident we mentioned where HUPD responded to complaints about the art project in the performing latinidad class. All of which has boiled over in to massive protests of late.
OGO: To that point, the second theme Joan noted was how HUPD has historically interacted with student activism, particularly from students on the left of the political spectrum.
Steffen: But one of the big, big things that came out was the sort of response to, HUPD’s response to student activism on campus or student political organizing, and sort of who they saw as worthy of a police presence and who they didn't and who was, who they reacted to with violence and who they collaborated and cooperated with.
MNW: I, and probably many others, hear this and immediately think of the University Hall occupations of the late 60s and early 70s, against the Vietnam War or South African apartheid.
OGO: Famously, in 1969, hundreds of people were arrested for protesting the Vietnam War, in a bloody clash. But the instances of student activism butting heads with HUPD is so prevalent throughout the twentieth century, from arresting anti-Nazi protestors in 1934, to closing down a John Reed club meeting during the 1950s Red Scare, to shutting down the aforementioned Liberated Women’s Center in 1971.
MNW: Student activism, it seems to me, is so tied up in accountability. Members of HAACC described how difficult it was to get access to HUPD police logs, so that they could create their report. If students don’t have access to HUPD archives, they can’t begin to critique it and act against it. Another instance, back in 2004, demonstrates the opacity of HUPD.
Amit Paley: So when I spent a lot of my time as an undergrad working on the crimson and trying to get information to the Harvard community and to the general public that I and others in the krimson thought was really important for the public to know about, and that that intersected with a couple different issues that related to access and, and Harvard trying to keep records secret that we did not believe should be kept secret.
MNW: This is Amit R. Paley, class of 2004, who served as the Crimson’s president and is currently on the Crimson’s Graduate Council Executive Committee. Amit was well-attuned to what he has called a ‘culture of secrecy’ about Harvard’s internal workings and discrimination at the University, both past and present. In 2002, Amit wrote a groundbreaking article for fifteen minutes about the harvard secret court of 1924, a secret tribunal held by 5 harvard administrators to investigate same sex attraction on campus, and his piece was cited in the supreme court case lawrence v texas. A year later, in 2003, Amit and the Crimson wanted to access HUPD crime records that could have contained important information about allegations of race and sex discrimination by Harvard police officers.. The University said no, and that summer, the Crimson sued on the grounds that Massachusetts law would have required a municipal police force to make those records public.
Paley: And then I think when it comes to the, the police, I just think to me, it is such a, it is so clear that when that when that when people have the ability to deprive people of their liberty of their physical safety, to imprison people to use force against people, that is an incredible power that is given and that society, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts has decided to give that power to Harvard University Police officers.
Paley: There were two forms of state police power that were given to the Harvard University Police Department, I believe that they were given some types of power as sheriffs and they were given some types of power by, I think it might have been the superintendent of police.
MNW: The HUPD had been granted power similar to that of local police departments, yet were not subject to the same transparency laws. And to this day, according to the HUPD website, Harvard police officers “are sworn special State Police officers with deputy sheriff powers” with “the authority to enforce state and local laws and University policies” — yet the lack of transparency, more than 15 years after Amit did his investigation, continues.
Paley: And it was, it was this sort of strange situation, which I think a lot of people at that time did not appreciate, that you had, you had individuals employed by a private institution that had significant powers of the state and significant police, law enforcement powers of the state. And that, to us, that made a really clear legal argument that given that they've been granted these powers by these public agencies, they should be accountable to the same checks and balances as public agencies.
MNW: The case dragged on. The Crimson lost in several rounds of litigation, the students who originally filed graduated, and two and a half years later in 2006 the case was finally resolved when the massachusetts’ state superior court ruled in Harvard’s favor.
OGO: It seems that students have been butting heads with HUPD for a long time. And meanwhile, HUPD has tried to change, mostly by way of reform. Being on the modern front of reform, with mixed results, was the third theme in HUPD history that Joan pointed out.
Steffen: I think, also just seeing over and over again, how Harvard kind of actually was in many cases at the front end of the curve, and sort of the different efforts at police reform that we've seen in the past. So Harvard was really at the cutting edge for introducing sort of computerized policing and trying to use technology for surveillance and data about things like arrests and incident reports to sort of redistribute their officers and target, quote unquote, “high crime” areas and sort of turn policing into more of a science. That obviously didn't work in terms of addressing the problems that we're concerned about. Then Harvard was also at the forefront of trying to implement community policing as well. And again, like more recently, Harvard tried to do, you know, diversity and equity initiatives with the police department that also haven't solved the problem. So I think, over and over again, we've seen these efforts that reform that have fallen, fallen completely flat. And I think that, thatjust underscores for us another reason why abolition is just so necessary.
OGO: In 1973, HUPD created the Security Student Patrol, where students would police the community. In the same year they put two million dollars toward security, including developing CCTV, and in ’74, they created a Crime Task Force of plainclothes officers. These reforms didn’t really work; in 1974 Harvard spent $1 million-plus on security but saw losses to theft grow 46%. Throughout the 70s, it continued to modernize, and it hired its first Black police chief, Saul Chafin, in 1978. Later, in 1983, HUPD hired another Black police chief named Paul Johnson.
Steffen: So like Harvard has, Harvard Police Department has explicitly tried this before, it was one of the promises of the former Police Chief Riley. The police chief beforehand was a Black man, police chief Johnson. And his tenure was characterized by just repeated incidents of racial discrimination by HUPD, criticism from some Black student organizations, you know, throughout his tenure in the 1980s and 1990s. So that obviously hasn't been successful in the past.
OGO: And Riley was brought in in 1995 to improve relations between police and the Harvard community, championing a community policing model, diversity trainings, diverse hiring practices, and the like. Yet throughout his tenure — and especially in the past few years — we’ve seen numerous incidents of what many call racist and anti-poor policing, as we’ve described over the past couple of episodes.
MNW: Yeah, I mean that incident with the Black Men’s Forum in 2007 triggered its own series of responses from University administration. Barnhill organized the I am Harvard campaign afterward, to bring attention to anti-Black racism at the institution, which included a protest before Primal Scream that year
Barnhill: So we wanted to utilize this as a moment to make a statement that the Harvard student population is diverse. And we're just as much a part of this institution as you are. And that was a whole spirit behind the I am Harvard campaign [...] I feel like the community appreciated what we did. President Drew Faust was the president at that time. In response, she agreed to form a campus climate committee to address these issues
MNW: So of course, Faust formed a committee, and in addition to that a huge review of the HUPD was convened in 2008, releasing a hundred-plus page report in 2009. It found many of the same problems as reviews of HUPD from 2018 and 2020 — lack of transparency, distrust of police, racist incidents, and so on. But the tone of this 2009 report is all about community policing, noting “how much common ground there is between the HUPD officers and other members of the Harvard community” — and the recommendations are basically ways to integrate HUPD with Harvard better and create good relations with students. In response to this 2009 report, Harvard created a Safety Advisory Committee to consider how to better integrate HUPD into Harvard’s campus. So we see a few things here: response to controversy with a review, and the review consisting of reformist approaches to policing, to integrating HUPD and creating mutual understanding instead of tackling structural problems of racism and policing, which is both reflective of the history of HUPD reform we just went over, and harkens back to our third episode, when we saw how Harvard for 40 years has elected an integrationist model to racism and diversity, encouraging interactions and cultural understanding over really tackling structural issues.
OGO: All these reforms and reviews of HUPD remind me, also, of all the reviews and changes we’ve seen to diversity more broadly, from the first one, the 1980 study of race relations, to the enormous presidential task force on inclusion and belonging, seem to forget their past iterations, or at least be uncannily repetitive. It’s striking how many of the short-term recommendations in the 2020 report by 21CP are similar to recommendations in the 2018 report of the HUPD issued after Yardfest, which we discussed in episode 1: consider medically trained responders, transparency, rethink HUPD relationships to surrounding police, be attuned to needs of students of color. So to HAACC, this history and pattern of HUPD reform, whether it is technological or through representation, is untenable. They see abolition as the only answer because of the historical failure of reform within HUPD. As Brooks put it,
Brooks rerecord: What we need is wholescale — systemic, foundational, radical, as in at the root — transformation of policing, in the American context.
Segment 3
OGO: So we return to today’s conflict over the future of the HUPD — although our present is caught up, it seems, in the endless cycles and reverberations of the past.
MNW: A lot of the trends in past reforms to the HUPD — like diverse hiring, diversity training, community policing models, and so on, all of which have failed to stop recurring feelings of unsafety and troubling incidents of racist and anti-poor policing for decades of HUPD’s history — track closely, if not in timeline than in terms of implementation and falling short, to attempts nationwide over decades to end violent and racist policing. There are so many reasons Brooks said police reform has failed:
Brooks: Some of it has to do with the focus on performing policing broadly without addressing racism, particularly
Brooks: Mass incarceration is literally the fruit, literally the manifestation of systemic racism on the back end. And destructive policing is the manifestation of systemic racism on the front end.
Brooks: studying the problem can lead to what martin luther king called the paralysis of analysis
Brooks: police taking responsibility for that which they are manifestly unqualified to do.
Brooks: we study the problem, and the and the study leads to a call for more resources.
MNW: It seems like a lot of those apply to Harvard, and a lot of them have to do with the Harvard diversity review — focusing on policing without focusing on racism is similar to how 21CP focused on the entire Harvard community and weighted everyone’s opinion equally, which doesn’t center the how policing disproportionately impacts Black and brown students, those perceived as poor, transgender people, and so on. Or how the 2018 presidential task force on inclusion and belonging equating racial and class diversity to that of political ideology. Or how the 2018 Yardfest report focused on changing Yardfest as much as changing HUPD policy.
OGO: And looking at this long history of HUPD, it’s full of instances of reforming police consisting of more money, new computer systems, hiring more diverse officers, diversity training — which are all things 21CP recommends in their pillar 2 of short term solutions. I don’t see them turning out differently. Ironically it was a bicycle patrol, which HUPD chief riley implemented as a measure to improve community relations in the 1990s, that was sighted at that BLM rally in franklin park last june.
MNW: And then this notion Brooks raised of the paralysis of analysis — I mean, that could be a title of any one of our episodes, this seems to be what diversity reviews at Harvard, especially, do: study and delay. Not necessarily with bad intent, but there’s this confluence of factors — Harvard is huge and decentralized. Harvard is old and slow-moving. Harvard is insulated from competitive incentives to make big changes on diversity fronts. Some perceive Harvard as wanting to protect its status as super elite. Harvard is born out of slavery and hierarchy. Harvard is full of academics who think studying is important. And there’s a lot more — the Harvard diversity review might be especially predisposed to the paralysis of analysis. The question becomes, how do you force a review to turn into action — especially at an institution where the people often agitating the most for change — students — grow exhausted and inevitably graduate on a 4 year cycle?
Brooks: These efforts to study the problem can be a way of running down the clock, meaning we suck out all the anger, the outrage, the energy from protests, we direct it into a commission a task force, a study or report, and a year or two later, the outrage, the anger is gone, but it has not been replaced by substantive reform and transformation.
MNW: Joan said something similar,
Steffen: That's almost like waiting out activists approach. And I think that's part of why, you know, like, we wanted to go ahead with this report. We don't think that we need the 21CP external review to know what the problems with HUPD are, we don't think we need like another community task force to determine what the role of HUPD is, in terms of community safety, you know. And even aside from, like, this information already exists, right? First of all, we're writing this report about what student problems are, what student problems have been for decades with HUPD. It’s the same complaint, it’s the same issues. It's just being raised now in a more urgent way because of our context, our like current political context, and you know, the fact that we've kind of come together as organizers or whatever — but these these have been coming up over and over and over again, these problems for decades, is part of what we found. So there's not really a need to get the information together. And if, and if this is about, you know, how to devise community solutions and community alternatives, there are experts who already have knowledge and expertise in those areas. There's a whole wealth of information about transformative and restorative justice practices
OGO: If we think back to our third episode, on the Presidential Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging, when we talked to experts on diversity and D&I reviews in higher education and corporations like Daryl Smith and Frances Frei, they said reviews are important if we can hold leadership at all levels accountable for making real change based on the report. Bond, the 21CP reviewer, said basically the same. But from Hilda, to the students in Donald Barfield’s taskforce in the 1980s, to Amit Paley before us at the Crimson, to “I, Too, Am Harvard,” to HAACC — how do we do that? If students respond to crisis with protest, and Harvard responds to protest with report, and the report slows things down, it’s almost by definition too late to get angry again at the report’s outcomes, or to hold anyone accountable to the report’s recommendations?
Brooks: studies and reports can sometimes delegitimize both the claims of injustice and those who make the claims. Meaning when we say this problem is a matter of both sides. This is a problem in which we all have a stake in responsibility, which is most often true, but that we have an equal share of culpability, which is often not true.
MNW: Right, like it’s kind of ridiculous to suggest the very people hurt by racist policing have equal responsibility when reform efforts fall short. No, it’s the same institution that perpetuates the violence in the first place, that is largely culpable for the solution’s failure, or for failing to even trying to fix the problem. What do we do about that?
Brooks: When we look at, at Harvard, in the context of this national pattern, we have to ask ourselves, not is a taskforce report and audit wrong, per se, but has it been set up and created to bring about, to bring about the good. And one of the ways we can ask that question is not, is there going to be accountability at the end of this commission or task forc —, we have to ask the question, is there accountability as we're doing the study, conducting the task force or the commission? So in other words, does, is the task force, the commission charged with delivering a set of recommendations during a certain timetable, are those recommendations tied to incentives, but also accountability measures? Is the task force synced in time in such a way that the community is not worn out when you come to an end? So for example, let's say freshmen, not freshman, first-years at Harvard College call for the creation of a task force. And the task force takes four-and-a-half to five years to deliver a report. By definition to people who call for the task force or the commission have graduated and are no longer around to hold those who authored the task force and populate the commission responsible and accountable [...] if the audience will report is merely the people who are a source of the problem? That's a problem, right.
OGO: In part, it sounds like we’re too late with this podcast — that we’ve questioned and investigated all these diversity and performance reviews after the fact, but this work needs to happen beforehand. Someone should have been publicly, loudly asking 21CP what “community” means back in June when they were hired, not now.
MNW: But people definitely were asking — like Brooks said, culpability is not equal here in the failure to turn reviews into action. We see, again and again and again, it being impossible to hold either the process and products of the Harvard diversity review accountable: Only one of 15 professors we contacted on the presidential task force of inclusion and belonging being open to an interview, only 7 undergrads being included on that task force, period. Nobody agreed to interview about the Yardfest report. No on-the-record comment from the University on PULSE or the presidential task force, no comment about criticisms of HUPD, nothing on the advisory committees being formed to implement 21CP Solutions except for the opaque and cosmetic Gazette interviews with Harvard administrators. Sometimes we’d ask people who led a review to comment, the reviewers would refer us to harvard public affairs and communications, and harvard public affairs and communications would refer us back to the individual reviewers.
OGO: Alright, but maybe there’s an opportunity to make this time, this specific moment of reckoning with policing at Harvard, different. I mean, 21CP Solutions has outlined a thorough review process and included mechanisms in it for the review to be transparent and accountable throughout. That seems promising, not unlike what Brooks described, not unlike what Smith described in episode 3 — a diversity review, to be effective, must change the central ways and structures of a university, instead of being secondary priorities. It must engage the entire university, and it must be aligned across leadership. And to that end, Harvard is working on making a facilitating committee to lead that reimagining public safety process that 21CP recommends in pillar 1. This is a chance for the University to take racism and policing seriously, and more importantly, a chance for students to hold the review accountable as it happens, instead of just afterward. But I’m hesitant to be optimistic. For starters, Harvard originally said the facilitating committee would start on April 30, but now they’ve said it will get underway in the fall. So more delay, more time to wait out students, more energy students have to expend to make sure this reimagining happens at all. When Brooks said the taskforce needs to be made such that the community is not worn out at the end, that really stood out. Every generation of students has been worn out, especially students of color. From Florence Houn, in 1980
Florence Houn: for me to say something 40 years old that is resonant today shows you the amount of progress that has been made. Because, you know, I was very — when that report came out, I knew I was ready to leave Harvard, and I did not want to improve the lives of people at Harvard. That was not a goal in life, because it was not going to achieve anything concrete.
OGO5.39: To Hilda Jordan, in 2018:
Jordan: What is my ability to follow up on these things when it's not a part of, you know, my — it's not, it's not a part of my coursework, I'm not getting paid to do this, it's emotionally taxing. I have to sort of relive and then do it.
MNW: How are students and activists supposed to engage these reviews? I posed the question to Brooks:
Brooks: But you also want to avoid standing on the sidelines, because when you stand on the sidelines, the process takes place without your input. And those who may be opposed to your advocacy can say, in effect, their complaints aren't legitimate in any way because they don't care to make them. So students, not just at Harvard, all over the country are really caught in a bind. And the bind the students are caught in, meaning they need to be supportive, they need to participate in these processes. But they also have to maintain a critical distance in terms of not unwittingly endorsing things that they shouldn't have to endorse. But the impact on the students is even, is even more profound than that. The impact on students in engaging in consultation is not unlike the ways in which communities are called upon to engage in consultation, meaning we pay consultants, we get your input for free. The consultants are doing this at an analytic and critical distance, at an emotional distance that does not traumatize them does not cause them to be triggered by what they have to recall and recount. When it comes to communities, when it comes to students, they can literally be triggered and traumatized by what they're going through. That's not to say that students with communities are comprised of citizen snowflakes. It's not to say that people aren't resilient and resolute and have a sturdiness of character. It is to say this is tough work, right? Like, you know, I've told the story often of being, having recently graduated from Yale Law School, finishing a clerkship, coming to work in Washington DC years ago. And being stopped by the police, having the police ask for my ID. I reached my eyeglasses, and the officer reaches for his gun. I've had the experience of being profiled many, many times, okay, and being cursed out more than a few occasions. Now, when I talk about that I'm, my endeavor is to inform and to share, and to perhaps enlighten people who want to have a conversation about policing. But when I tell the story, it is not without some kind of psychic cost or emotional tax, it's unpleasant. But you know, what's true for me as a civil rights lawyer who has been in, been in this business for 25 years, I think is more true for a first-year or second-year at Harvard College. But in other words, when you're mistreated, it can be cathartic to tell that story, but it can also be taxing emotionally to tell that story. And we got to acknowledge that. So my point being is, when you participate in these processes, you're literally spending emotional capital. You need to spend it, it's important to spend it, but other people shouldn't shouldn't assume it's free.
MNW: We’ve spent so much of this podcast trying to demystify how the University works, but each of the diversity reviews we’ve looked at arose from the labor of individual students and faculty and staff, of activism and agitation. That labor — not the University’s, top-down, but that of those on the ground — might be the key. We started this podcast asking, how can an institution with so much history have so little memory? But maybe the better question is, how can an institution with so many resources and people and talent, with such a professed dedication to inquiry and research, pay so little notice? And in an institution with so little memory, that seems at times so oblivious, how can — how do — students keep themselves going to make Harvard pay attention?
OGO: We’ve spoken again and again about dedicated leaders and individuals, about positive signs in recent years that Harvard administrators are at least thinking about and making baby steps when it comes to race, racism, diversity, inclusion. But all these mechanisms, the penchant for study and framing of equal culpability and the sprawling bureaucracy and Harvard’s overlapping research, financial, and public image incentives and Harvard’s integrationist approach and the pervasive opacity and student activist graduation timelines and their exhaustion — how much “good” can good will really do?
MNW: Reviews arise from events, student voices and national context and dedicated people trying to make change to the University. Those people’s voices are eventually washed away — or exhausted, or waited out, or superseded, or delegitimized. And the review quickly follows, resigned to the archive for us to dig up years later and subject to yet another review.
MNW: Under Review is a podcast from Fifteen Minutes, the Harvard Crimson’s weekly magazine, hosted by Olivia Oldham and me, Matteo Wong. Our producers are the amazing Zing Gee, Thomas Maisonneuve, Lara Dada, Justin Ye, and Jason Lam, who produced this final episode.
OGO: We are so thankful to Ian Chan for being game to join this project and compose original music, and to Meera Nair for the cover art. Huge thank you to Jamie Bikales, the Crimson’s managing editor, for wisdom and editing throughout. And along the way we’ve had so much support, from Ben Naddaff-Hafrey, Marcus Montague-Mfuni, Rebecca Cadenhead, Josie Abugov, and everyone else at The Crimson.
About Under Review:
How can Harvard, an institution with so much history, have so little memory?
The racial reckonings and Black Lives Matter protests that swept the country this past summer brought attention to a trend in how Harvard seems to deal with student activism and concerns surrounding race, racism, and diversity: to commission a diversity review. These committees and reports long predate this summer, and reading them it can seem, at times, like some things have not changed at the University — in race relations, Harvard’s review process, or the findings and recommendations. What can these diversity reviews accomplish, and what can’t they?
“Under Review” is a podcast from The Harvard Crimson, hosted by Matteo Wong and Olivia Oldham, chairs of The Crimson’s weekly magazine, Fifteen Minutes. Each week, they will explore controversies and diversity reviews stretching across 40 years of Harvard history, speaking to dozens of students, activists, experts, and more, to try and understand how the Harvard diversity review works — or doesn’t.

Emily E. Gonzalez ’21 (née Hunter) and Justin F. Gonzalez ’21 married the summer before their junior year. They tied the knot in Niagara Falls, Hunter Gonzalez’s hometown; flew to Maui for their honeymoon; then returned to Boston to settle into married life in their suite in Pforzheimer House.
“We blocked together, which people say is a big no-no, but it worked out for us,” Emily says.
The couple met for the first time during Visitas, the weekend in April when prospective freshmen visit campus. They happened to sit down at the same table in Annenberg, and then decided to walk to the Coop together to pick up Harvard t-shirts, where they ran into Hunter Gonzalez’s parents. “I actually went to the bathroom with Emily’s dad,” Justin remembers, laughing. “We’re really close now, and I feel like that’s when our bond really started.”
The two met again at the beginning of their freshman year, when they both did dorm crew, one of Harvard’s pre-orientation programs. They started dating that fall, solidifying their bond over all-nighters finishing problem sets in Lamont. They began discussing marriage that winter break.
“We knew we wanted to be together forever, and we were going to wait until after college, just because we knew that’s what everyone else did. It’s the more normal, accepted thing to do,” Emily says. “But then we realized, should we really be making a huge life decision just based on what other people think?”
During February of their sophomore year, Justin visited his home in North Carolina, where he had shipped the engagement ring. When he flew back to Boston, Emily picked him up at the airport. Justin thought to himself, “‘I don’t want to wait, I want to be engaged.’ So I got off the plane, I headed down the escalator at Logan, and as soon as I saw her I proposed.”
The couple married in a small ceremony in Niagara Falls, and Emily says there wasn’t much of a change to their everyday college lives after the marriage. If anything, others had a harder time adjusting than they did. “People looked at us a little differently,” Justin explains.
Last March, when students had to leave campus because of the pandemic, the couple moved to Niagara Falls, where they have been living since. Justin works as a software engineer for Amazon. The couple bought a plot of land in Niagara Falls, and Emily plans to spend the next year building a house.
The two say that they don’t regret their decision to get married halfway through college.
“We knew we wanted to be together forever,” Justin says. “So why prolong the inevitable?”
A date had been set, a venue booked. The wedding was to take place in Detroit, Mich. on May 9, 2020. Two hundred fifty guests had already been invited.
But in March of that year, as the world turned upside down and inside out, everything changed.
On March 10, Jadyn K. Bryden ’21 — then Jadyn Broomfield — awoke to the announcement that she would be required to leave Harvard’s campus by the week’s end. Then, on March 15, she received news even more devastating: As the Covid-19 pandemic evolved and worsened, Byden’s chosen venue called to say that it could no longer host the reception for her wedding to William S. Bryden, Jr.
“We were obviously very devastated,” Bryden recalls. “All our plans were in the garbage.”
Bryden had been planning to travel to Costa Rica for spring break as part of a program for young adults; when those organizing the trip decided that they would still go ahead with their plans, she went along. Then, only a few days later, the situation deteriorated. “While I was in Costa Rica, they were like, ‘Yeah, we actually have to deport you from the country because of Covid,” she says.
In a span of only 10 days, Bryden had been forced from campus, her wedding venue, and a foreign country. Then, she and her fiancé had an idea: “Harvard was kicking us off campus until at least the fall back then,” she remembers thinking, “so let’s just get married now.”
Together, the couple called Jadyn’s local pastor in Detroit. He agreed to host their wedding on Zoom, and they circulated a link among their friends and family spread across the country. “It kind of felt like we did a courthouse wedding in a way, which is not what I ever would have expected,” Jadyn says. “I put on a white dress, Will put on a tux, and we did our vows and everything on the call.”
Their wedding, immortalized in a now viral TikTok recorded by Jadyn’s childhood friend and maid of honor Charlotte, took place only 11 days after Harvard students learned they would be required to evacuate campus. “Over the next couple months, we saw lots of Zoom weddings,” Jadyn says. “I’m convinced we were the first.”
Jadyn, a History of Science concentrator in Mather House, and Will, a December 2017 graduate of Johns Hopkins University, first met through a church community group in February 2018. They and their friends would often see movies together, until one evening when all except Jadyn and Will canceled plans to see “Avengers: Infinity War.” Even after the film’s nearly three hour runtime, they elected to prolong their evening for dinner in Boston’s North End. Before Jadyn left Cambridge for the summer, the pair started dating.
“It was a breath of fresh air as I was going through college to be dating someone who was not in the super high stress, high intensity environment,” Jadyn says, recalling Will’s unique perspective on aspects of Harvard’s culture.
For Jadyn, that “breath of fresh air” has continued to animate her and Will’s marriage, even amid the twists and turns of the pandemic. “It’s been the best thing ever,” she says of their married life. “I could not have chosen a better time if I knew about the pandemic,” she continues. Jadyn references how Will would comfort her in moments when she felt overwhelmed by online school work. “It was a really tough year for a lot of people, and to be able to have a built-in support system made me feel extremely blessed.”
Today, Jadyn and Will live in North Cambridge with their new puppy, Zeus. Jadyn has begun work at Xfund, an early-stage venture capital firm. Will works for 6 River Systems, a warehouse logistics and fulfillment company based in Waltham, Mass.
“Starting our marriage in the pandemic allowed for us to have a lot of quality time together, and we now know each other extremely well,” Jadyn says. “It was definitely a blessing.”
Many of Jessica S. Edwards ’21 and Joshua T. Walton ’21’s most cherished memories happened at two in the morning.
One of their earliest memories of getting to know each other is hanging out at Tasty Burger the night after Harvard-Yale. “We just talked until like two in the morning, and then we had our first date not too long after that,” Walton remembers. A few months later, they woke up at two in the morning to take the bus to New York City to see a Broadway show and explore the city. And during the pandemic, the couple traveled to the Boston Medical Center before the sun rose to get vaccinated together. “We went to the Boston Medical Center at 2 a.m. to get a vaccine. We sat there from 2 a.m. to 5 a.m. We watched Les Misèrables on the streets right in front of the Boston Medical Center,” Walton says. “So that was definitely a highlight of the pandemic.”
Edwards and Walton met at the beginning of their freshman year through mutual friends. They remember spending time together since they occupied many of the same spaces: They were both members of Harvard College Faith and Action, and they both volunteered with Y2Y, a homeless shelter in Harvard Square. Walton also started attending rehearsals for the Kuumba Singers of Harvard College, of which Edwards was a member. “Through serendipitous interactions with each other we started talking a lot more,” Edwards says. They started dating sophomore fall.
As opposed to their memories of sophomore year, “junior year is a bit of a blur,” Walton recalls. When students left campus last March because of the pandemic, Walton and Edwards went to their home states of Mississippi and Virginia, respectively. The couple took the time apart to more concretely plan their marriage, which they had begun to discuss before they left campus.
Last September, Walton visited Edwards in her hometown of Alexandria, Va., to celebrate their birthdays — and to propose. Walton consulted with Edwards’s parents to figure out the best way to include both of their families. “I have two sisters and a mom, so they were working overtime to help me find the right ring,” Walton says. Walton and Edwards went out to dinner, where Edwards’s parents joined in person and other family and friends joined via Zoom to watch the proposal.
After all the planning, the event was relatively straightforward. “And then I proposed at the restaurant, and that’s that,” Walton remembers, laughing. “People cheered and gave us a bunch of drinks.”
The marriage is scheduled for July 10 in Memphis, Tenn. Afterwards, the couple will live together in Washington, D.C., where Edwards will work as a software engineer for Microsoft and Walton will work as a third grade teacher for Teach for America.
At their wedding, Edwards and Walton are looking forward to a lot: dancing, being with groups of people, seeing friends and family they haven’t been able to see since the start of the pandemic. “Over the past year, we’ve been wondering how closely our plans could come to fruition,” Edwards says. “We feel lucky to be able to have as normal of a wedding as possible.”

How can Harvard, an institution with so much history, have so little memory?
The racial reckonings and Black Lives Matter protests that swept the country this past summer brought attention to a trend in how Harvard seems to deal with student activism and concerns surrounding race, racism, and diversity: to commission a diversity review. These committees and reports long predate this summer, and reading them it can seem, at times, like some things have not changed at the University — in race relations, Harvard’s review process, or the findings and recommendations. What can these diversity reviews accomplish, and what can’t they?

Hilda M. Jordan: We're the Chosen Few that allegedly have made it and, you know, are the “golden ones,” quote unquote, by Harvard's own, you know, reputation — and not even that can save us while walking home.
Lawrence S. Bacow: Here in Harvard Yard, we must embrace diversity in every possible dimension
Adela Cepeda: I felt that the University didn't know how to even categorize us, at least on the Latino side.
Daryl Smith: Too many reports will say things like we urge deans and department chairs. We are long past the urging.
Yardfest Visitas protest: Black lives matter at Harvard, too. Black lives matter! Black lives matter!
OGO: I’m Olivia Oldham,
MNW: And I’m Matteo Wong, co-chairs of the Harvard Crimson’s weekly magazine, Fifteen Minutes. We’re excited to bring you Under Review, a podcast investigating what we’re calling the “Harvard diversity review.”
OGO: Over the next five episodes, we’re going to explore a number of moments over decades of Harvard’s history, from police confrontations to mass protests that we think shed light on the racism and structural inequalities embedded in this institution, and the University’s frequent response of committee followed by report.
MNW: Reading these reports, it can seem at times like some things have not changed, in the racism at Harvard, the University’s review process, or the findings and recommendations. How can Harvard, an institution with so much history, have so little memory?
Natasha Warikoo: It's a natural response to say, well, let's study the problem, that's what we do
Cornell W. Brooks: Studying the problem can lead to what Martin Luther King called the paralysis of analysis
OGO: On June 2, 2020, as Black Lives Matter protests swept the country, bicycle patrol officers from the Harvard University Police Department were photographed assisting Boston PD in policing a peaceful BLM protest at Franklin Park. The photo went viral on Twitter, and within days President Lawrence S. Bacow announced he was bringing on an external consulting group to review policing and public safety at the University.
Abolish HUPD protest: Today, we assemble outside the university-financed home, insured no doubt with slave money, of Larry Bacow to call for the complete and immediate abolition of the HUPD
Brenda Bond: A review like this is actually a really good way for an institution to do a check on themselves
Noah Harris: It's like they're resistant to, to change, but at the same time they're asking us, you know, how we should change HUPD
MNW: In our first episode, coming next week, we’ll be taking a deeper dive into an incident of police brutality at the College from the night of April 13, 2018, and its reverberations to the present day. What happens when Harvard’s instinctive response, to study and review, comes up against the life-or-death consequences of racism and policing — ones that the summer of 2020 brought into sharp focus?
Brooks: This is a national problem in terms of its consistency, its uniformity, its historicity. But it's also a local problem, in the sense that you have 18,000 police departments, of which Harvard is but one.
Yardfest Visitas protest: Treat me, don’t beat me! Treat me, don’t beat me!

Over the past year I have repeatedly begun, and each time abandoned, writing down my emotional and cognitive responses to surging anti-Asian racism. I haven’t faltered because the writing is too painful, or because I can’t find the perfect words; although both of those things are true, inadequacy and turmoil are precisely why my impulse is to pick up a pen. Rather, I hesitate because the motivation to reflect and write about myself in the wake of media reports of brutal attacks on others — people bearing the Asian or Asian American label more vulnerable than me — seems entirely self-centered.
I worry that giving my feelings a written form will formalize them, and myself, within a problem that has little to do with me, taking up discursive space needed for the stories and lives that, barring spectacular violence, are often ignored. My Ivy League, upper-middle class, male angst seems trivial, and writing about it disrespectful, to physical and verbal assaults on elders in Chinatowns across the country; the murder of Soon Chung Park, Hyun Jung Grant, Suncha Kim, Yong Ae Yue, Xiaojie Tan, and Daoyou Feng in Atlanta this past March; the structural hierarchies squeezing and endangering the lives of so many Asian migrants in the United States.
That hesitation begins in private — even a journal entry dedicated to my distress would indulge and enact my narcissism. Whereas if I don’t write them down, perhaps the thoughts never existed at all.
A public essay would be worse, betraying a clear desire for readers to recognize and validate my pain, to salve my shameful privilege. Especially to write only after the Atlanta shootings, about myself or anything at all, when I’ve not done so before suggests my priorities regarding the violence are egotistic. And the public arena, where there is finite time and space for nonwhite stories, only magnifies the risk of watering down or drowning out overlooked voices with my own. This essay, then, is a contradiction — why have I written it?
That question, “Why am I writing?”, has been the endpoint of every cautious foray into inking my angst. And upon concluding my motivations are selfish, I stop. But on the most recent attempt, I realized the question I’d really been asking all along is distinct: “What function does my writing serve?” The difference is that, while “Why am I writing?” is more fundamental (and perhaps unanswerable), pondering not what I write for but why write, full-stop, the question “What function does my writing serve?” asks what particular role words play toward a concrete end.
Which then leads me to ask, why is my impulse amidst this surge in anti-Asian violence not only to set my responses to writing, but to think of that writing in terms of function and, finding the function unsatisfactory and self-centered, to abandon the project? And why do I locate function in a zero-sum calculus of legibility and recognition?
***
Obviously, I have a major case of what Cathy Park Hong names her acclaimed essay collection after, Minor Feelings: the dysphoria of being Asian in America, with the endless gaslighting of that racialized experience by white institutions and people that script you as a successful, well-behaved “model minority.” Hong writes that, “when minor feelings are finally externalized, they are interpreted as hostile, ungrateful, jealous, depressing, and belligerent, affects ascribed to racialized behavior that whites consider out of line.”
Indeed, prior to this writing I’d not actually “externalized” anything. The gaslighting is internal, telling myself that these affects are out of line and resigning myself to the position of white ally in the reductio ad absurdum of the model minority myth. To borrow from Hong, “because we know we won’t be believed, we don’t quite believe it ourselves.”
And even if I can begin moving beyond this preemptive doubt and self-censorship, and manage to write something, I’m just as concerned about what might happen if the white mainstream does, somehow, recognize my externalized minor feelings.
In the wake of the Atlanta shootings, it seems the country has awarded some small portion of “Asian America” a provisional medal in the oppression olympics. Yes, the recent outpour of statements and legislation and commitments is simplistic, largely pathetic, and already slowing to a trickle. But such gestures at all are rare (this is an essay about feelings, and they at least feel significant), and their fleeting existence is all the more reason to muzzle my privileged voice and center stories that usually go untold in the hope that we are on the cusp of achieving something substantive: protections for migrant workers, gun control, economic programs geared toward specific populations deemed Asian American.
This concern is itself presumptuous, assuming other people will take the time to read my rambling. But it is also empirically sound: The Harvard affirmative action lawsuit, Hollywood representation, and boba take up an outsized portion, dare I say majority, of the space given to Asian Americans in mainstream news, social media, and other public forums. It is reasonable to expect that the outcry over anti-Asian violence will translate into increased attention to privileged perspectives, to my minor feelings.
But arriving at that conclusion returns me to the beginning of this spiral, a belief my feelings are “out of line” — not just because the people and institutions running the oppression olympics say so, but because in the pursuit of racial justice, I do. I seem unable to imagine a form to grapple with this messy malaise that does not direct itself toward the material and quantifiable, those conditions we can diagnose and treat.
***
In her groundbreaking book, “The Melancholy of Race,” Anne Anlin Cheng writes that the United States is a nation comfortable with grievance — an impulse to articulate racial injury as specific social claims of static identity groups, which can be quickly addressed and relegated to the past — but not with “the more immaterial, unquantifiable repository of public and private grief,” those messier, irresolvable affects and entanglements that come with being raced in the U.S.
Even after Black Lives Matter protests shook the nation last summer, it was only minutes before the guilty verdict in Derek Chauvin’s trial that police in Columbus, Ohio killed Ma’Khia Bryant, a 16-year-old Black girl. Less than 24 hours later, police in North Carolina fatally shot Andrew Brown, Jr., a 42-year-old Black man, in the back of the head. A grievance was partially resolved; grief and rage and racism, denied, proliferate.
The tendency toward grievance, rather than grappling with structural racism and the grief it generates, is a national condition Cheng diagnoses as racial melancholia. The term “melancholia” derives from Freud, who used it to describe a pathology in which patients who cannot fully mourn or overcome a loss come to hate the lost object for its absence. The melancholic patient copes by psychically internalizing that which was lost to be closer to it — which means that they also internalize and consume their hatred and exclusion of the object, and then direct that hatred inward. As Cheng writes, “The history of the ego is thus the history of its losses.”
The American pattern, “racial melancholia,” is to partially include a racial minority in service of denying, and thus reinforcing, underlying exclusion and racism — contradicting the egalitarian ideals supposedly at the nation’s core: If the Chauvin verdict constitutes “justice,” then punishment and policing and the carceral state become “just.” Asian Americans are particular objects of this national melancholia, held up as evidence of a functioning meritocracy to repress more complex identities and entrench historical and ongoing inequities.
Yet Cheng also notes how lost or excluded objects of racial melancholia — people of color — are themselves melancholic subjects, with our own act of retention-rejection: aspiring toward mainstream inclusion even as we reject the white ideal as unattainable. Perhaps I, and many Asian Americans, have internalized this melancholic calculus of racism, prone to converting our grief into grievances and subconsciously conceiving of writing as only toward specific ends. Despite being excluded from and resenting the white ideal and its recognition, some part of me still craves it — hoping a big or clear or precise enough grievance, such as the murders in Atlanta, will finally lead to transformative change while knowing and witnessing that such change may well never come.
And so, what happens when the lost object speaks; when, given these material and psychic limitations, we do try to express our malaise? What forms exist to communicate and grapple with Asian Americans’ public and private racial grief and outrage?
***
In the white mainstream, none. Anti-Asian violence is not new, but it took the spectacle of a mass shooting to bring sustained attention to it. Even then, media headlines parroted the absurd defense of Robert Aaron Long’s murders, a so-called “sex addiction,” as a possibly legitimate excuse for days; A1 and landing-page web headlines in The New York Times read “Sex, Porn, and Guilt: The Life of the Suspect in the Georgia Killings” or an abbreviated version of that, as if one of the country’s premier newspapers sought to offer a psychological profile or advertise a thrilling erotic film, rather than report on the killing of eight people, six of them Asian women. The recent bill to prosecute anti-Asian “hate crimes,” which passed both houses of Congress with largely bipartisan support, is literally a mechanism to turn grief into grievances, equating progress with the carceral state and ignoring messy questions about the intersections of anti-Blackness, capital, and xenophobia. And only a week after the Senate approved the bill, President Biden kindled anti-Asian racism in his triumphant 100th day address to Congress, saying, “America is moving — moving forward — but we can’t stop now. We’re in competition with China and other countries to win the 21st Century.” To quote Hong again, who wrote in her essay collection a year earlier, “You are told, ‘Things are so much better,’ while you think, Things are the same.”
Harvard, a supposed beacon of American elitism and excellence, is no better. University President Lawrence Bacow’s response to the Atlanta shootings was to deploy the reductive language of particular grievance, to blame bad “actors… those who perpetrate [hate]” and suggest calling the University police if one feels unsafe — despite the fact that Harvard’s police force faces intense criticisms of racism and sexism, making many feel manifestly unsafe. Meanwhile, Harvard’s Counseling and Mental Health Services told Asian Americans struggling with Covid-19-related racism that “you may wish that you weren’t Asian, but to remember that your ancestors” went through worse, advising us to be resilient by making “positive” art and trying to “return” to “safety, predictability,” normalcy. Those blatantly offensive words were even more painful because, as University of California, Santa Barbara Asian American Studies professor erin Khuê Ninh observes, they read like “an inside job.” That is, Harvard’s “advice” described thoughts and emotions I’d been having without any prompting: quantifying my grief to compare it to what my grandparents suffered; telling myself to keep my head down and thoughts positive; seeking to “return” to a white norm that I could never attain in the first place. These are the stunted forms Harvard offers, and the only forms I can offer myself, to process racial melancholia.
(This harmful language was on the CAMHS website’s AAPI Resources page for several months before outrage on social media led Harvard to change the webpage and issue an apology. That nobody flagged this advice as racist for so long suggests zero people seeking advice on Asian American mental health went to CAMHS for help in that span; that nobody who saw the page was shocked enough by this racist “advice” — it’s expected behavior from Harvard — to call it out; or the voice of anybody who did call it out was ignored. Harvard’s apology, from late March, states “More information will be coming soon” — as of publication, we are still waiting.)
For Asian Americans, one place for our grief might be public writing: the essay, polemic, meditation. Yet such articles written in the past year often bend toward grievance, with a formal requirement (like the line endings of a sestina) being some version of the oversimplified history proving “Asian America” is coherent and worth the (white) reader’s time: 1882, 1941, 1965, 1968, 1982, 2021. Another acceptable form is to rehash an explanation of the radical political origins and present contradictions of the Asian American category, generally framed in terms of calculable social claims: Asian America does not cohere because some Asian immigrant or refugee struggles outweigh or do not compare to those of others. Such essays are, of course, important. Yet we expend so much getting the conversation in the door — twisting our words into the same, tired forms — that there’s little room left for nuance, let alone grief. That is not to say we should avoid history or material analysis or specifics, but to question why so much of that analysis takes the form of adding up particular grievances to then probe or outline a (“clear”) political path for Asian Americans, “people of color,” or the nation as a whole.
One might instead turn to efforts to collect data on anti-Asian racism, quantitative and qualitative and necessary, but by nature collapsing back into grievance. And there is social media, subjected to the structure of a 280-character Tweet or the Facebook feed algorithm, writing stuck in a particular chamber of followers and almost instantaneously superseded by the next post or cute cat, which makes substantive, communal dialogue near impossible.
There are also poems and stories and open letters and essays and more, beautiful and heart-wrenching, that do reckon with grief and minor feelings; that provide room to breathe and have no resolution and make a mess of history and don’t rely on providing one way forward; that do not strive to clearly delimit what they rage at or mourn for, and are not afraid to simply rage and grieve.
But I sometimes worry those forms don’t have any reach — in other words, that they aren’t functional. A friend and mentor, after I emailed her one such piece that moved me, told me she was trying to share this sort of writing with non-Asians, and particularly white people; to influence those that might not otherwise consider such perspectives and avoid preaching to the choir. My inclination, for several months, was to agree. As Hong wrote over a year before Atlanta, “If a prostitute died alone without anyone as witness, did she ever exist?”
A similar dilemma plagues my journal: The justification for writing in private is that, because I am my only audience, such writing has no material impact. And that implies that I do not count as “anyone,” do not exist.
***
As I try to list existing forms for Asian American grief and their limits, I see a common thread in my concerns — the assumption of needing to reach a white mainstream audience, presumably those with power. And I see myself again slipping into the languages of grievance, legibility, recognition. I’m left asking why, when only other Asian Americans and people of color seem to read and respond to a piece of writing, I think of it as preaching to the choir; but when we try to communicate with white people it so often feels like shouting into the void.
I question who, exactly, constitutes “anyone”, who sets those terms, and why having such a witness is important — asking not only why write, but also who do I feel the need to write for? My answers to those questions have uncannily paralleled the U.S. Supreme Court decision in People v. Hall (1854), which ruled that Chinese immigrants, along with Black people and American Indians, could not testify against white people in court. At the heart of not wanting to “preach to the choir,” I now realize, is a desire to communicate grievance rather than irresolvable grief, to be legible to white people.
Refracted through the prism of the nation’s and my own racial melancholia, the inclusion-exclusion of Asian Americans and my retention-rejection of that (white) national ideal — then further filtered by some combination of rising anti-Asian racism, the Atlanta shootings and their aftermath, and the available publishing, political, and legal apparatus — my thinking and writing in response to a tangle of hierarchies and unquantifiable racial pain transform into the language of neat identity categories and delimited, redressable social claims. And yet those claims, the particular physical and psychic racial injuries, seem to linger, and then multiply; I have felt the need for mostly white power structures to recognize my grief even as they are incapable of addressing a single grievance. Maybe whiteness is a void.
(It’s no coincidence that the formal requirements for Asian American writing on racial pain, to either cohere or question “Asian America,” occurs especially in mainstream, hallowed institutions of journalism like The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Atlantic, and so on — the same publications that published awful, insensitive coverage of the Atlanta shootings.)
The greatest paradox of Freudian melancholia, Cheng notes, is that the melancholic subject doesn’t want the lost object to return: “exclusion, rather than loss, is the real stake of melancholic retention.” Having internalized what was lost, the melancholic subject is now closer to it than they ever were in reality; were the lost object to return, the ego that at once retains and rejects that object, that hates the very thing it wants to possess, would destroy itself. And so melancholic loss necessitates an act of exclusion.
I wonder if the same is true of the United States — that if, were we to actually and publicly grapple with racism and racial grief, were the excluded objects of racial melancholia to return, the country as we know it would collapse, or undergo so much change as to make it unrecognizable. Cheng’s book makes affective and aesthetic arguments, not prescriptions about material change. But perhaps dwelling in those messy affects is what we need to do; perhaps the binary between politics and aesthetics, concrete and affective, is itself an attempt to convert grief into grievance when the two are inseparable.
By “we,” I mean not just Asian Americans or people of color, but everyone touched by and living within this empire called America, white people included. I’m not suggesting wholesale rejection of white audiences, but rather questioning the power we invest in those audiences even as we hate that they wield such power; that is, to interrogate our, and not just the nation’s, racial melancholia. Even writing this paragraph, I am already telling myself that temporary change is worthwhile and necessary, and that it is naive to just imagine away or ignore that whiteness is a locus of structural authority — but if even in our journals and essays and art we can’t begin to imagine otherwise, then how will we ever build, let alone inhabit, such a world?
So why do I write, and why did I write this? I’ve not resolved concerns over taking up narrative space, my privilege, or my narcissism, and I’m still hesitant to make this essay public. But in questioning why and how those doubts persist, and who they are responding to, I’ve realized I write not in spite but because of that hesitation; not to resolve paradoxes but to lean into them; not to be heard across the void but to inhabit it.
I wrote for an audience, a “we,” that is perpetually coming into existence; not to arrive at a neat form for these messy affects, but to dwell in the spaces created when we falter.

Jasmine M. Green ’24 didn’t realize how much the events had affected her, until one day, she began to cry as she sat in front of her computer.
“Not only did David Kane say these things,” she says, “but nobody cared about it.”
Green, a Crimson Editorial editor, was in her first year at the College, taking classes over Zoom due to the pandemic and inhabiting Harvard’s campus, which was occupied only by fellow freshmen, at its most quiet and desolate. Even the few people on campus felt largely out of reach due to the University’s strict residential guidelines.
And then, in late September 2020, things took a turn for the worse. Green, like many of her classmates in preceptor David D. Kane’s course Government 50: “Data,” found themselves in a miasma of hurt and confusion.
Classmates began to send messages in the Gov 50 Slack channel about a website called “EphBlog,” a blog ostensibly documenting the goings-on of Williams College. Sent in the Slack were links to a number of posts by “David Dudley Field ’25,” which some students allege is a pseudonym used by Kane — some content posted with the David Dudley Field ’25 account name are also signed with the name ‘David Kane’ in the text of the post. While Kane founded and moderated EphBlog and certainly authored some of the posts with the David Dudley Field ’25 account name, we cannot distinguish which of the Dudley Field posts were authored by Kane or by other EphBlog contributors.
One post authored by David Dudley Field ’25 defends the white supremacist group, Identity Evropa; another post criticizes “Black supremacy" in the NBA; according to a screenshot shared in the Slack, one post claims that “90%+ of the Black students at Williams would not have been admitted were it not for their Black’ness”; and one post contains graphs ‘Field’ made comparing the SAT scores of Black and Asian students.
The revelation of Kane’s racist beliefs was followed by written responses from Kane himself and Government department administrators. In the Gov 50 Slack channel,, Kane defended himself against the allegations, claiming that he does not support white supremacy and that Slack is “probably not the best place for this conversation.” A few days later, he followed up with an email sent to the entire class with advice for what students should do if they wanted to drop Gov 50, including instructions for switching into Government 51: “Data Analysis and Politics.”
“I thought that was the most evasive way of defending yourself,” Green says. “He didn’t say if it was true, he didn’t say if it wasn’t true, he really just said, ‘If you want to switch, go ahead.’”
After the initial discourse in the Slack, 25 members of the Gov 50 teaching staff signed a Slack message condemning the EphBlog posts and expressing support for students. On Sept. 27, 2020, Jeffry A. Frieden, the chair of the Government Department, sent an email to the students of Gov 50. The message notified students that the Add/Drop fee would be waived if they choose to switch out of Gov 50 and condemned the teaching staff for allegedly encouraging students to boycott class, calling their behavior “inappropriate” and “unprofessional.” In the email, he did not remark on Kane’s blog.
The discovery of Kane’s involvement with the racist blog and the effect it had on students is indicative of the perils of allowing academic freedom to spill over into hate speech: On EphBlog, ‘Field’ would often make charts and graphs to legitimate his racist claims.
“What really hurt me the most, that I’m still not over, is that the same programming language that he taught the class in, he used in order to make plots and charts to defend his racist claims,” Green says. “I knew I couldn’t trust him to teach me anymore if he’s literally manipulating data in order to advance his bigoted views.”
Kane declined to comment for this article.
Kane’s one-year contract was not renewed by the Government Department this year, as it has been for the past two years. Still, it seems that the harm and controversy that characterized Gov 50 last semester might have been avoided by Harvard. Kane’s ownership of Ephblog, as well as other instances of his racist beliefs, including public op-eds he has authored, are easily found on the Internet. This begs the question: How did Kane find a home at Harvard, and what were the consequences?
Before Kane’s blog was discovered by students in his class in the fall 2020 semester, things were going well for the recent hire. His class was increasingly popular among undergraduates. In 2018, Kane told The Harvard Gazette that his course would have no lectures, would lay the groundwork for any career, and would “be the most intellectually stimulating experience that you’ve had.”
Similarly, in the syllabus for the course, Kane promised Gov 50 would be less akin to a college course and more a transformative life experience, even an epic: “You are Ulysses. Thrinacia is a desirable internship/job next summer. The Sirens are the many distractions of the modern world. I am the rope,” he said, referring to an 1891 oil painting of a scene from The Odyssey. With the image pasted onto the first page of the syllabus, the class’ central metaphor depicts Ulysses on the way to Thrinacia tied to the mast of his ship, to avoid being lured to his death by Sirens.
He kept his promise to never keep students a minute late, but in order to ensure this, three students in Gov 50 last semester said that Kane sped through each class at a frenetic pace, making it difficult for many to keep track of what was going on. The whole class, according to some students, seemed to be marked by a feverish intensity. Kane would cold call students and would single out students who showed up to Zoom lectures late — in the end, there were indeed lectures in Gov 50 — or had their cameras off.
Gov 50 falls within a certain genre of Harvard course, slotted among classes like Humanities 10 — a selective survey of the Western canon in which freshmen get to work one-on-one with senior faculty — and Computer Science 50, which, among other things, offers students a weekly buffet at Changsho Restaurant and t-shirts that read “I TOOK CS50,” a not-so-subtle brag that one survived the trenches. These are prestige courses, classes which serve, it sometimes seems, as primarily a means of claiming belonging to a part of campus life: once you have finished taking Hum 10, you are added to a mailing list for other “Hum Alums.” The classes instill a sense of pride and ownership over Harvard’s academic life.
What’s distinct about Gov 50 is how quickly Kane elevated his course to such a status. CS50 was founded by David J. Malan ’99, who’s been written about in The New Yorker and whose approach to teaching computer science has generated satellite courses throughout the world. Hum 10 was founded by tenured professors in various humanities departments. Gov 50, on the other hand, ascended quickly and was the brainchild of Kane alone.
And then, just as suddenly, in Kane’s third year at Harvard, students were unenrolling from his course with urgency, sparked by a series of allegations of racism.
Earlier that fall, Kane invited Charles A. Murray ’65 to speak to Gov 50 students about his new book “Human Diversity: The Biology of Gender, Race, and Class,” which contests the ideas that race and gender are social constructs and that class is often a product of privilege. Murray is infamous for his 1994 book “The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life,” in which he argues that there are IQ differences between white and Black people and that those differences are innate and intractable. He argues that such genetic differences are the root of social inequality. Scholars have overwhelmingly discredited the book for its dubious “scientific” claims. Murray has been described by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a white nationalist. This past October, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay told The Crimson that Murray’s work does not have academic merit.
The invite drew criticism from many members of the University and many students in Kane’s class. Kane defended his actions in a September email to The Crimson, writing, “Harvard is the greatest university in the world. Whatever you think about the quality of his work, Charles Murray is one of the most influential social scientists of the last 50 years.” He added: “In the age of Donald Trump, Viktor Orbán and Jair Bolsonaro, Harvard needs more speakers from the right, not fewer.”
Unsettled by Kane’s invitation to Murray, Alexis Queen ’23, a student in Gov 50, began to scrutinize Kane’s own beliefs. If he was open to Murray, what other ideas might Kane be amenable to? That’s when, with a simple Google search, Queen stumbled upon the link to a website called “EphBlog.”
The subsequent outcry over EphBlog led to Kane’s removal as the nominal Course Head of Gov 50. On Oct. 5, Professor Kosuke Imai took over as the official course head and Kane stopped lecturing for one week. While Imai remained the official course head, Kane returned to lecturing. His lectures were made optional, and students were permitted to attend a lecture with a teaching fellow instead.
Dash Chin ’23, a student who opted to remain in Gov 50, says most students went to lectures with their TF, but Kane still had a presence in the class, communicating via email and posting messages in the Slack channel.
As Kane settled back into Gov 50, Green and dozens of her peers switched into Gov 51. Still, for many, the racist content they had read on EphBlog lingered.
“My first month at Harvard, I was told by my teacher that I don’t belong here, and that will stick with me,” Green says.
Before coming to Harvard for his PhD, Kane was heavily involved in campus life as a student at Williams College. A flip through the Williams 1988 yearbook presents a picture of Kane as a bold, energetic, somewhat eccentric Economics and Philosophy major. In addition to reviving a winter term Jitterbugging class, he is credited with reviving the tradition of yearbook signing at the Senior-Faculty picnic, and he played for the Men’s Squash Team.
On a page in the yearbook titled “Race Relations,” Kane is quoted stating: “Affirmative Action is a liberal euphemism for reverse discimination.” The quote comes from an op-ed Kane wrote for Williams’ student newspaper, The Record, in February of his senior year. The headline read “School’s policy of affirmative action is discriminatory,” and Kane opened with the disclaimer: “WARNING: The opinions expressed in this article will probably be called racist. Most, if not all, of them are also true. Since Williams trains us to believe the truth and not to believe anything that anyone has ever called racist, some students may want to preserve their liberal sensibilities by not reading further. You have been warned.”
At Williams, Kane stood out as a conservative voice. “Most college campuses tend to be more on the left side, and Williams was no exception,” says Paul D. Danielson, Kane’s classmate at Williams. “It was a pretty liberal campus, so if you’re sitting around and someone says a liberal political statement, he’d be the one to disagree with that.”
Upon graduating, Kane joined the Marine Corps, where he served as an oOfficer until 1991. Danielson remembers the summer before his senior year, when Kane was enrolled in the officer candidate school, looking out the window of his dorm to see Kane running past, training tirelessly.
“At that time, there were very few liberal members of the student body planning a career in the military,” Danielson says, “so it sort of fit with my impression of David as a whole.”
After serving in the military, Kane started a degree at the Harvard Kennedy School, from which he graduated in 1998 with a PhD in Political Economy and Government.
During his time at HKS, Kane served as a tutor in Eliot House for four years. In a picture published in 2018 by the Harvard Gazette, Kane stands mid-lecture, smiling in front of a map of Boston — on his white short sleeve t-shirt is the Eliot House crest, with the year “1997” below it.
Before his last year at HKS in 1997, he and his wife, Kay Kane, were told by Eliot House co-masters Stephen A. Mitchell and Kristine Forsgard that they were not renewing their contract. He saw his firing as an abuse of power and sent a “vitriolic eight-page email,” according to a Crimson story from the time, to over 200 residents of Eliot House. In the letter, he calls Mitchell a “two-faced liar” and says that Forsgard has “shut-the-hell-up dagger eyes.”
A few years later, Kane was hired by Harvard as a guest lecturer in Government 1000: “Quantitative Methods for Political Science I” for the 2002 fall term. The next year, he founded EphBlog.
In the years since, Kane has lived a double life of sorts: He founded a hedge fund, Kane Capital Management in 2004, which he ran until 2010, while also teaching courses at Middlebury, Williams, and Harvard — all while attending to the blog around once a week.
On Williams’ campus, EphBlog wasn’t a secret at all. In fact, EphBlog was well known at Williams, as was the fact that Kane was the blog’s founder and frequent contributor. The blog was popular and celebrated on campus among those who agreed with its claims, and even those who rejected its ideas were drawn to it for its shock value. In fact, in 2019, a spinoff “EphBlogBlog” popped up, often criticizing the EphBlog’s posts or providing a more liberal point of view on the Williams issues EphBlog discusses.
“I wouldn’t call it a secret at all,” says Nigel Jaffe, a senior at Williams and an executive editor for The Record, Williams’s student newspaper. “Most students would have heard about it by their senior year, and most faculty are aware [of it].”
Jaffe noted that, for Williams students, Kane is synonymous with EphBlog. Because of the numerous posts by David Dudley Field ’25 on EphBlog that are signed “David Kane ’88,” posts that promote Kane’s classes, and include pictures of him,” Jaffe says there is no doubt among Williams students that Kane is running not only EphBlog, but also the David Dudley Field ’25 account.
“A lot of people would be like, ‘This is fucking crazy, look at this,’” Jaffe says. “You would be hard-pressed to find anybody who wouldn’t call the blog insane.”
Many of the posts on EphBlog are unambiguously racist, sexist, and homophobic. On the blog, ‘Field’ claimed that there is no need for Williams to have a Women’s Center, noted that, during the author’s time at Williams, he was “widely known as the campus homophobe,” wrote that “‘Sexism in the elite workplace’ is 95% fantasy” and about his distaste for what he calls “crackpot feminist quackery,” made a defense for Williams students who used homophobic slurs, proposed Willams professors should come together to discuss racial differences in IQ, claimed that the reason Williams has had fewer female students as commencement day speakers was because of the biological differences between men and women, challenges the notion that Japanese internment was immoral while linking articles in defense of racial profiling, and says that xenophobia isn’t nessesarily a bad thing.
But the most common posts from ‘Field’ are those about the admissions process at Williams, particularly the ways he believes it is biased by race. “Legacy status does not provide a meaningful advantage in admissions to elite colleges like Williams,” ‘Field’ wrote. Many of his posts are about what he calls “The Parable of the Privilege Pill,” in which he concludes that “the source of academic ability is irrelevant,” meaning that the way socioeconomic factors — namely, the advantages of wealthy students — influence one’s academic performance shouldn’t be considered by an admissions committee.
Kane has written openly, using his own name, about the admissions process outside of EphBlog as well. In a September 2017 op-ed for The Record, Kane argued that Williams should accept fewer applicants of color, or those from low-income backgrounds “in order to create a Williams with students as smart as those at Harvard, Yale, Princeton and Stanford.”
For 17 years, Kane tended weekly to EphBlog. “Senior administrators at Williams have remarked that the only thing that could make him take it down would be the threat to his career,” Jaffe says.
On EphBlog, ‘Field’ endorsed ideas based on dubious data and disputed scientific research. In one post from 2005, he refers to himself as a “Duesberg man,” meaning someone who subscribes to Peter Duesberg’s false claim that AIDS is caused not by HIV, but by recreational drug use. In another, he raises doubts about the legitimacy of global warming concerns: “The silliness over global warming among very smart Ephs never ceases to amaze me,” he wrote. “Evidence for rising sea levels couldn’t be very good since so many people lived in places, like Naples, that would be flooded.” He continues, “Anyone who is certain that they know what sea levels are going to be in 20 years is an idiot. Think Deeper.” Upwards of 97 percent of scientists agree that Earth’s climate is warming, according to NASA.
For some of Kane’s Gov 50 students, Kane’s questionable use of data became a concern when deciding whether to drop the class.
“I was primarily concerned that the material I was being given was being colored by Kane’s views, and there was no way to separate that material from his personal beliefs,” Daniel P. Pinckney ’24 says of his decision to drop Kane’s class. “I was concerned that if I had remained in the class that I would have been exposed to those views in a subconscious way where I didn’t have as much control over making sure that it was an objective or balanced point of view.”
Pinckney noted that he also had doubts about Kane’s ability to judge objective data after he invited Murray to speak as an “expert,” given that Murray’s views have been deemed pseudoscience by many scholars.
And yet, if anything, the denouncement of Murray’s work has only served Murray’s endeavors to mythologize himself as a besieged intellectual who refuses to be silenced, a crusader for academic freedom, and a brave, if misunderstood, truth-teller.
Academic freedom and free speech are often used interchangeably, the former being viewed as a subset of the latter. The debate on academic freedom is complex, bound up in the repression and censorship of academics, particularly Black radicals and leftists, during the time of Mccarthyism.
“I grew up around people who had really, really terrible experiences in the late 40s and 50s,” says Government Department chair Frieden. “Tens of thousands of people in that period — professors and teachers and graduate students — had their lives ruined because they were communists, had been communists, or said they had been communists or people said they were communists. Looking back historically, one of the reasons that the experience was so terrible was because too many universities and school boards were not willing to defend people with unpopular political opinions.”
“We don't sanction instructors for their political views,” he continued. We don’t ask potential instructors what their political views are. we don’t look at their social media accounts to see what they’ve posted. I would consider it unethical to do that.”
Many scholars and policymakers have weighed in on the debate in the past years. They have voiced concerns over professors making unsubstantiated claims, particularly so-called conservative intellectuals like Murray using their ensconced positions to advance racism, sexim, and homophobia under the guise of legitimate academic inquiry. Many of them have argued that academic freedom should be not a limited, but rather a conditioned form of free speech.
Yale Law School professor Robert C. Post, in a 2016 speech at Columbia Law School, said that “academic freedom rests on the notion that, as best we can determine, there are true ideas and false ideas.” His argument is a genealogical one, tracing the two separate lineages of academic freedom and the First Amendment.
The crux of his speech rests in the 1915 Declaration of Principles on Academic Freedom and Academic Tenure, which defines academic freedom as upholding “not the absolute freedom of utterance of the individual scholar, but the absolute freedom of thought, of inquiry, of discussion and of teaching, of the academic profession.” Professors are free to make academic arguments, but any argument must be made “by a scholar's method and held in a scholar's spirit.” In other words, professors are to be held to a higher standard than the average American because their words are taken that much more seriously.
Post’s argument is a soundbite from the thorny landscape of free speech debates that have riddled headlines and spread across campuses in the past decade. A significant number of those headlines have included Murray’s name.
In March of 2017, hundreds of students at Middlebury College protested a talk by Murray given at the request of a conservative student group. The protests turned violent, a fact many publications, including The New York Times and The Atlantic, made central in their reporting. The Times article also cited “an open letter to the college from more than 450 alumni objecting to Mr. Murray’s presence on campus,” which claimed the issue was “not a matter of free speech” and that Murray’s views “were offensive and based on shoddy scholarship and that they should not be legitimized.”
The following fall, Murray showed up in Cambridge at the request of a Harvard student organization called Open Campus Initiative that sought to “test” the limits of free speech. Protests ensued.
At a faculty event aimed at countering Murray’s talk, History and African and African American Studies professor Walter Johnson said that, “The question of free speech on campus is defined as more-or-less equivalent to the question of the rights of white men and conservatives to disrespect, insult, bait, and degrade everyone else.” Murray, far from being silenced, gave his talk largely unimpeded; after protesters left the room, he chuckled, “This is way better than Middlebury.”
EphBlog itself is largely a reaction to what Kane sees as the stifling of free speech at Williams. Several of posts on EphBlog double as defenses of Williams students who have found themselves in trouble for using racial and homophobic slurs and other hate speech. Jaffe says that sometimes current students post “who feel like they’ve been alienated by the liberal climate at Williams.” He added that he believes many of these people are “soapboxers who believe that they’re being silenced even as they continue to soapbox.”
More than 100 pages deep into the EphBlog archives, there’s a post from Field dated Sept. 29, 2004, in which, among other musings on free speech, Field writes, “You have a right to free speech — meaning the government should leave you alone.” But he continues, “You do not have a right to free speech — meaning that your employer needs to keep sending you a paycheck no matter how offensive/idiotic you are — in the workplace.”
The statement reads as a somewhat less sophisticated version of Post’s argument. And yet, for Kane and Murray and others, the converse of Post’s academic freedom argument is often what ends up being practiced by the universities and think tanks that employ them. Rather than their status as professors holding them to higher standards of what is permissible for them to say, their status as professors gives Murray and Kane license to categorize much of what they say as academic inquiry. Their status also legitimates what they say: For those academics who have made a name for themselves, their authority establishes the facts when it should be the other way around.
“If there were a clear line that could be drawn [between legitimate political views and hate speech], the courts would have found it,” Frieden says.
In a 2019 interview with The Crimson, Dean of Harvard College Rakesh Khurana voiced concern over students protesting controversial speakers: “The way change happens in society is that people have to hear voices. They have to be able to argue points of view and be able to persuade,” Khurana said. “It's not only a part of our College’s mission, but I think it's really important for democratic society right now.”
Kane taught a class this past semester, Government 1005: “Big Data.”
In an email to Gov 50 students obtained by The Crimson that was sent at the end of the fall 2020 semester, Kane congratulated the students: “Despite some occasional . . . uh . . . hiccups in the course, you have all worked very hard.”
Chin was struck by what he read as Kane’s snarky tone. “There’s a saying, ‘Don’t let the door hit you on the way out,’ which I think was very much his attitude when people were wanting to switch classes,” Chin says. “He was so smug, and over time it just got boring, like, we get it — you’re not going to face any consequences.”
Kane is not the first Government department faculty member to evade public consequences. Between the 1980s and 2018, Government Professor Jorge I. Dominguez was able to evade responsibility and punishment for an entirely different set of harmful actions — not hate speech, but allegations of sexual harassment.
In the spring of 2018, The Chronicle of Higher Education published two articles in which 18 women came forward with allegations of repeated sexual harassment against Dominguez. A few days later, in response, then-Government department chair Jennifer L. Hochschild announced a conference in which Government department faculty would come together to discuss how to “better promote and sustain a safe and respectful community.”
The allegations that came against Dominguez in 2018 were by no means a surprise. Harvard had been privy to allegations of Dominguez’s inappropriate behavior at least since 1983, when Assistant Professor Terry Karl and a Government graduate student accused the professor of multiple acts of sexual harassment. Dominguez was temporarily removed from his administrative roles — and just his administrative roles — for a short period of time but, just two years later, Dominguez returned, chairing two academic committees.
Michael P. Adams ’83, a thesis advisee of Dominguez’s in the 80s, told The Crimson in 2018 that “If Harvard had dealt with this appropriately in 1983, 1984, none of those other women would have been harassed.”
Following the resurfacing of allegations against Dominguez in 2018, the Government department formed the Committee on Climate Change to investigate and improve the climate of the department that protected and promoted Dominguez. A subcommittee on “recruitment and retention” analyzed trends in the racial and gender makeup of the faculty over the years, and the report that was published recommended that FAS Dean Gay authorize two faculty searches for new hires in the Government department: one whose focus is in gender politics, and one who focuses on race and ethnicity.
That spring, after the Climate Change committee was formed, the Government department also hired Kane.
With a promise to create a safe community within the Government department, and online information about how Kane’s appointment might be at odds with that promise, how was Kane hired?
According to Frieden, when hiring new faculty, the Government department looks only at the professional record of the candidates rather than posts on social media or personal opinions unrelated to their teaching.
“Current policy issues are, in my view, extraneous to whether the individual is suitable in the classroom environment,” Frieden says. In considering candidates, the Government department looks for a history of instruction in the classroom, reads teaching evaluations, and recommendation letters.
“We are trying to hire the most diverse and the most excellent staff that we can,” Frieden says.
Many students, teaching fellows, and course assistants from Gov 50 declined interview requests for this article. Many explained that they found the events too painful.
Similarly, Jaffe told us that, at Williams, “For some people their association with EphBlog is quite traumatic because Kane has targeted them on it.”
Today, students at Harvard — in particular, Black, queer, and woman-identifying students who had their education interrupted when they abruptly fled Gov 50 last semester — are facing similar pain.
“I don’t even think David Kane knows how much he hurt his former students,” Green says. “Students who were so excited to enter this world and were met immediately with this racist wall that made them doubt themselves, their place at Harvard, and their ability to pursue their career.”
Ultimately, Green finds fault with the Government department’s response to the events of last fall.
“We still have these scars from this event,” she says. “And they act like it doesn’t matter.”

Tyler M. Alabanza-Behard, a low-income student at Harvard Law School, will spend his summer in the private sector at a big law firm and litigation boutique.
“Looking at the debt burden I have, the things I want to achieve for my family, and my kids in the future, the private sector feels like the only option to achieve all of those things because the public sector jobs don’t pay very well,” Alabanza-Behard said.
Before entering law school, Alabanza-Behard worked as a high-school teacher through the Teach for America program. While still passionate about the public sector, Alabanza-Behard said he will likely pursue private law for the next decade or so out of financial necessity.
“Public interest work, education policy, educational equity, is very dear to my heart,” Alabanza-Behard said. “At the same time, I am really motivated to look after my family and build intergenerational wealth, so I just don’t know whether returning to the public sector after graduating is compatible with my financial goals.”
Early in their Harvard Law School careers, students are presented with the task of choosing between the private and public sectors post-graduation. Ten months after graduation, 337 members of the Class of 2020 were working in law firms, compared to the 63 and 23 working in public interest and government, respectively, per employment data compiled by Harvard.
While some students and alumni said in interviews that the Law School has little influence over career choices, others argued that there is an institutional push toward the private sector. Low-income students said financial incentives play a formative role in pursuing a career in the private sector.
Harvard Law School spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in an emailed statement that the Law School is “deeply committed to public interest and public service,” referencing the creation of the Law School’s Office of Public Interest Advising, the Low-Income Protection Plan that increases access to public-interest jobs through loan repayment assistance, and the “largest and most diverse clinical program of any law school in the U.S.”
“Through all of these initiatives, Harvard Law School is committed to preserving freedom of job choice within the legal profession for its graduates,” Neal wrote. “Ultimately, our goal is to enable them to pursue their highest aspirations whether that’s in the public, nonprofit, or private sector.”
Several graduates of the Law School pointed to the vast number of law students who enter the corporate sphere as evidence of an issue not unique to Harvard Law School but systemic throughout higher education. They called on students and administrators alike to reassess the power structures governing higher education, contemplate the incentives that force debt-ridden students into certain career paths, and interrogate what the purpose of a Harvard Law School education should be.
Zoe Russell, a third-year law student at Harvard, said the path to big law — high-paying jobs based out of large legal firms — is “very straight, obvious, evident, and easy.”
Russell, who is an aspiring community lawyer, said searching for jobs that reflect her interests was more difficult for her than her peers who are pursuing legal careers in the private sector.
“There’s no guarantee that you’re going to find someone who is going to be able to help you do the thing that you would like to do, which I don’t think is the same in firm life, because the process of getting a job at a firm is almost the same no matter what you want to do,” Russell said.
Neal wrote that in recent years, the Law School's Office of Public Interest Advising has “assisted graduating students in landing a range of post-graduate fellowships” that enable individuals to work in “organizations employing a community lawyering model.” He added that the office provides the David A. Grossman Fund, which offers a fellowship to a graduating Law School student or law clerk who is pursuing community or movement lawyering.
Russell said that though the Law School has resources for navigating the “fellowship process,” there is not a “direct connection or direct link” to what she wants to do in the future.
Peter D. “Pete” Davis ’12, a graduate of the Law School and author of “Our Bicentennial Crisis: A Call to Action for Harvard Law School’s Public Interest Mission,” said that during his time at Harvard, public interest law was treated as a “special alternative,” while the “default option” for students was corporate interest law.
The Law School’s encouragement of students to attend the Early Interview Program, a two-week opportunity for students to secure corporate interest internships and jobs, Davis said, was a key example of this treatment.
“They wrote us an email if we didn’t sign up for the Early Interview Program,” Davis said. “Do you think they were sending emails to corporate interest students telling them, ‘We saw that you didn’t sign up for the public interest interview program?’”
Michael E. Shammas, a graduate of the Law School, said the Law School’s decision to hold the Early Interview Program — which is for private sector firms — months before the public interest interview program was one illustration of how students could be influenced to choose private law.
“The way Harvard interviews people probably encourages many more to unthinkingly, right, maybe go into a private oriented career that they would not otherwise want to go into,” Shammas said.
"The way the system works overall” has a tendency to “funnel” students into corporate law, per Shammas.

Kachaje, a former international student who is a legal officer at the United Nations’ International Organization for Migration, said that during her time at the Law School, she felt as though numerous forces were encouraging her to work in the private sector before pursuing her passion for human rights law.
“I went into law school being like, ‘I’m international, I want to work in human rights, I want to work for the United Nations, I want to do all of these things,’ and throughout law school, it was consistently reinforced that, ‘Okay, you can do that, but first do the firm thing. It’ll give you great training, it’ll give you great experience, and then you can go off and do whatever what you want to do.’”
Not all students feel the Law School pressures them to pursue careers in the private sector.
Velo-Vincent P. van Houden, a third-year student at the Law School, said he believes the Law School’s encouragement of private and public sector jobs is “balanced,” though he recognizes many events on campus are sponsored by prominent law firms.
“It’s not funneling people, but they come and present what they do, and you’re like, ‘Oh this is really cool,’” van Houden said. “But I think, overall, there’s not really anything that sways you one way or the other.”
Ralph Nader, a graduate of the Law School and former American presidential candidate, said many students are susceptible to the “golden handcuffs” phenomenon, where individuals try out the corporate sector only to remain in the industry.
“They come in idealistic, and they leave with corporate law firm offers,” Nader said. “They decide, ‘I don’t want to go down to New Orleans in some public defender job that pays $45,000 a year. I’ll just work for a while in corporate law firms, pay off my debt, and see what it’s like.’”
Rachel J. Sandalow-Ash ’15, a graduate of the Law School and former president of Coalition to Improve the Low-Income Protection Plan, said most students have to rely on the program when entering the public service sector to mitigate significant student debt.
“Basically, if you want to do anything that uses your law degree to advance social justice through workers’ rights, immigrant justice, tenants rights, gender justice, whatever it is, then you have this really substantial student debt burden that’s very difficult to pay off,” Sandalow-Ash said.
Neal wrote that LIPP — which assists students with repaying a “significant portion of their loans” — has been the “fastest-growing program” at the Law School over the past decade, with an annual growth rate of approximately 12 percent.
“HLS LIPP was the first law school program to help make lower paying public interest jobs more feasible through loan repayment assistance, and it remains one of the most comprehensive programs of its kind,” Neal wrote.
Russell, who is a low-income first-generation law school student, said she finds it “really strange” to see many of her friends from similar backgrounds entering the corporate sphere.
“It feels like their whole mindset has changed in ways that mine has not,” Russell said. “At every step, I’m still fighting for my future, and theirs is set in stone.”
Van Houden, who is a low-income student, said he chose to work at a private firm after considering both the public and private sectors because he believed that it would grant him valuable professional experience while alleviating his debt in a much shorter period of time.
“I think the training I get at a law firm will really help me in my career and also pay off the loans more quickly,” Houlden said. “By accumulating some personal wealth through these higher paying jobs, I, long-term, can do more.”
Kachaje, who is also currently on the LIPP program, said that despite being grateful to LIPP for added financial security, she was concerned the program may deter recipients from building assets.
“LIPP takes into account how much assets you have to calculate how much money you should be receiving,” Kachaje said. “If you’re thinking of saving for any kind of future, it means you are encouraged to save, but only up until the cap because once you start saving any more than that cap, LIPP will start taking money away from you.”
As an international student who does not have generational wealth, Kachaje said homeownership and other asset-building methods are ways for low-income and first-generation students to “start building generational wealth.”
“You can’t do that while you’re on LIPP, and if you think about it, that’s 10 years outside of you graduating where, yes, you can save a little bit, but you can’t save too much — otherwise, that starts to get punished.”
Neal wrote that while the Law School cannot forgive debt, the Harvard Student Loan Office “offered loan payment relief on Harvard Student Loans to graduates experiencing hardships” as a result of the pandemic.
Harvard Law School, Neal added, is one of two law schools in the country that provide 100 percent need-based aid for students, with grant aid to students increasing at an annual rate of approximately 6 percent.
William H. “Bill” Barlow II was working at a private law firm when he realized that his quality of life was “significantly worse” than when first considering a career in law.
At the time, a friend came to visit Barlow in New York, where his law firm was located. The friend was a district manager at a restaurant chain, his wife worked as a nurse, and they had a “beautiful daughter.” The visit caused Barlow to reflect on his own fulfillment, he said.
“Something seems fundamentally broken about the fact that I was so deeply unhappy and in such a desperately difficult work situation, whereas my friend wasn’t making as much money as me, but was obviously much happier, more fulfilled,” Barlow said.
Barlow, who exited his firm and began his own practice this past year, said there is a significant difference between his past and present law experiences.
“Now I’m just growing my own practice independently and am sort of a free man and my own boss. I have a partner now that I work with, a fellow Harvard Law grad,” he said. “Goodness, it is night and day, what it’s like to work for yourself and to be your own person.”
Kristopher H. “Kris” Yue, a graduate of the Law School who worked for three years at a private law firm, said he was able to pursue his interest in international law during his time working in the corporate sector.
“I really got the stuff that I wanted to do in law firms,” Yue said. “Now I know that’s not the experience that my other classmates have. Some of them quite dislike, from what I know, the stuff that they do. They’re not very interested in it.”
Having transitioned to the public sector in 2019, Yue works at the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, also known as the Khmer Rouge Tribunal. He said he shifted careers because he originally went to law school with the intention of working in public interest.
Lillian S. “Lily” Axelrod, a graduate of the Law School who currently works as an immigration lawyer at a private law firm, said she had a “really positive experience” navigating future career opportunities at the Law School.
“I came in knowing I wanted to be an immigration lawyer, so I was never agonizing about whether I should do the big law firm recruiting,” Axelrod said. “I never felt the pressure to do one thing or another.”
Axelrod, who is currently on LIPP, added that the program was especially helpful because of the breadth of students entering the public sector who benefited from its services.
“I’m really grateful for the program, especially after the last round of improvements with respect to childcare, which helped me a lot as I’ve been moving forward in my career,” Axelrod.
Law School alumnus Bruce E. Fein said the issue of lawyers flocking to the private sector is a systemic one, which extends beyond Harvard. To Fein, law schools are abrogating their duty to train future lawyers to be “ministers of justice” who pursue justice rather than winning cases.
“I think that the Law School — and I wouldn’t say it’s unique to Harvard — is deficient in failing to emphasize that the goal, the purpose, of our legal system is justice,” Fein said. “It’s not winning a case for a client.”
The Law School, Fein said, has become more of a “trade school” where individuals are educated to compellingly argue cases in their client’s favor.
“We need to have the Harvards and the Yales to be graduating the students who are much more attuned and think in terms of justice as being the end, not winning the case or winning the war,” Fein said. “It’s what I call the difference between always asking ‘why’ before asking ‘how.’”
Nader said many of his peers were more concerned with “the law as it is written” as opposed to “the law as it is supplied.”
“There’s a big difference,” Nader said. “Look at our constitution — it has a lot of fairness written throughout, but we know how it was used.”
Barlow said he believes institutions of higher education should reform to move away from an emphasis on the private sector.
“It’s a little myopic to think that this is a Harvard Law problem, as opposed to an institutional problem with higher education,” Barlow said. “All institutions of higher education are facing very similar challenges, and it’s not surprising to me that Harvard Law hasn’t solved it, because no institutions have solved it.”
Sandalow-Ash said that despite choosing the public sector herself, she feels students should not have to shoulder significant financial burdens in order to pursue careers in line with social justice.
“These are the choices we make because we think this work is really socially valuable, meaningful, and important to building a better world,” she said. “But we shouldn’t live our lives being just totally worn down by debt because we’ve chosen to become public defenders or legal aid attorneys or to advocate for the rights of people who are not uber wealthy.”
Sandalow-Ash said she believes it is important to examine what the purpose of a Harvard Law School education should be.
“Is it just to train corporate lawyers, or is there some sort of broader idea that we should be able to use our law degrees towards building a more just society?” Sandalow-Ash said. “Part of that is making it financially feasible for us to do so.”

Dear Class of 2021,
Today is not the day that we proudly parade through Harvard Yard with other members of our Houses. We won’t be sitting alongside each other under the foliage of Tercentenary Theater. We remember the first time we nervously sat in these chairs four or more years ago, not knowing all that was waiting for us at Harvard.
Today is not the day that we exit Harvard Yard and return to our courtyards to congratulate ourselves and our classmates on this accomplishment. Our loved ones have tears in their eyes, while they hold us in their arms.
Rest assured, that day will come.
Today is the day, however, that we graduate from Harvard. We surround ourselves with family or friends and click to open link after link. We remember all of the Zoom links that got us through junior and senior year and joke about how we’re also graduating on Zoom. We also remember all of our personal links and connections to our peers both in and outside the Class of 2021.
Today is the day we celebrate one of the greatest parts of Harvard: the people.
Though each of us differs in how we arrived at Harvard and chose to spend our time in Cambridge, we still find common ground in the fact that the people are what give Harvard its value. There are only three things that happened by chance at Harvard: your admission, your freshman dorm assignment, and your House assignment. Everything else that happens is by choice: what friends you make, what concentration you choose, what extracurriculars you participate in — it's all up to you. In the past year and a half, we have been stripped of the breadth and depth of student choice that allow us to customize our Harvard experience in a way that gives it the most value for us and our personal circumstances. We lost the ability to fully experience each other one last time. We are now stuck trying to hold on to the details of memories from our first year and second years at Harvard to define our time at Harvard because we do not want this to be our Harvard experience. But it is. We faced a global pandemic and racial reckonings, all the while taking classes, writing theses, working jobs, and leading organizations. Some of us worked on the front lines, helping to develop and distribute the vaccine or creating posters to stand in solidarity as people marched through the streets. We have been trying as hard as we can to not accept this, but we should. We did the damn thing.
As we move on in life those memories may fade, but we will never forget the way that people made us feel — the way that these moments made us feel. As you watch today’s ceremonies, take in every single feeling — how proud you are, how loved you are, how excited or nervous you are for what comes next. Pay attention to the way you smile when your name is called. Notice the way your tassel falls between your fingers as you move it from left to right. Focus on yourself, the people surrounding you, and how your sacrifices and accomplishments have brought you all here today. Today is your day and we are grateful to be a part of it.
Class of 2021, we will embrace, connect, and love each other in person again soon: We’ll take care of that. For now, take a breath, reflect, and get ready: The real world is waiting for you.

Sanjana S. Ramrajvel ’22 and her blockmates, who usually live in Dunster House, were dispersed geographically this past academic year. Though long distance placed a strain on their relationships, she said their ties to their Harvard House united them.
“We all try to make it a point to go to the Dunster trivia nights,” she said. “We would just all Zoom in from wherever we were, and that was a fun way for us to bond, but I definitely would say that we contacted each other a lot less because we weren’t physically in the same location.”
Ramrajvel is one of the many students at the College who opted to live off campus this past academic year, either barred from campus as a result of the public health crisis or opting to avoid the strict residential guidelines for those in the dorms.
While 98 percent of students typically reside in Harvard dorms and houses, this year saw only 40 percent and 60 percent of students invited to live on campus in the fall and spring semesters, respectively.
Students who were not invited back to campus experienced a variety of living situations this past year, from moving back in with their parents to traveling to coveted destinations with friends, to renting apartments in the Cambridge area. Even among students who were eligible to return to Harvard this year, many decided to forego University housing.
Though they were unable to scavenge the buffet provided by Harvard University Dining Services or serendipitously catch up with friends they encountered in the stairwell, students living off campus described in interviews feeling a sense of freedom and independence living on their own.
Whether they lived on campus or off this past academic year, all students will have the opportunity to live in Harvard’s dorms this upcoming year, Harvard administrators announced Tuesday.
Though during any typical year most students would not hesitate to accept a spot in their House, this fall students must weigh the benefits of residential House life — a hallmark of the Harvard College experience — with newfound joys they experienced living outside the Harvard bubble.
Boasting dining halls, gyms, libraries, common spaces, and throngs of students, Houses are microcosms of Harvard’s campus, which contains an assortment of services and facilities within a small radius.
“I think the best part of the college experience is being in a dorm,” Gabrielle R. “Gabby” Brown ’23 said.
Per Brown, the College’s housing system and the social environment makes on-campus life more appealing than off-campus alternatives.
“You have to go grocery shopping, you have to cook your own food every day, you have to make sure that you always have enough money to pay rent or stuff like that,” Brown said of off-campus living. “It’s just less stressful to be on campus, and you’re also surrounded by your peers at all times.”
Juan M. Molina Jr. ’22 said he was initially ambivalent about living in Harvard’s dorms in the fall after spending the past year off campus.
“I’m from New Orleans. I love to cook. HUDS — they’re wonderful, but I like my own food, the food that I’m able to cook,” he said. “But I really do want to be back on campus where all the activity is, where all of my friends are, and not have to really make such an effort to go and see other people.”
A friend of Molina convinced him of the perks of living on campus, he recalled.
“My friend said to me, ‘Well, having a kitchen is great, but you have your whole life to have your own kitchen and get your own groceries, and living on campus is something you’re only going to have for a year-and-a-half,’” he said.
Julia S. Casas ’24, who spent her freshman fall on campus and the spring semester off campus, said on-campus life enabled her to more easily make friends.
“The first semester I was on campus, I got to meet lots of people, I got to interact with my friends who are in Apley, some of which are in my blocking group now,” she said. “Whereas second semester, it was definitely a lot more isolating being off campus. I was really fortunate to have my roommate, Kathleen, but there were times when I was just really lonely, or I did feel kind of disconnected from the Harvard campus community.”
Some students lauded House life for creating fulfilling social environments.
Joanna Boyland ’23, who spent the spring semester living at home with three of her blockmates, said she is excited to experience routine social interactions on campus that once seemed banal.
“I enjoy seeing people, seeing, perhaps, the same semi-familiar faces in the dining hall and saying hi to them but not really talking to them,” she said. “It’s just meeting people and making connections outside of who you’d normally, naturally hang out with.”
While some students lauded chance encounters with their classmates as a positive aspect of the College’s residential experience, Abigail T. “Abby” Forbes ’21 likened on-campus living to running into someone in her hometown grocery store.
“You know how if you go back to your hometown, and you’re always worried about running into people you know at the grocery store?” she said. “Well, sometimes living on campus at Harvard feels like your apartment is in the grocery store, and the moment you step outside, you’re gonna run into like five people you know in the grocery store.”
Forbes, who is undecided about her fall 2021 housing plans, said off-campus housing would offer her much-desired privacy. In addition to constantly seeing classmates, Harvard students must contend with swarms of tourists who descend upon campus.
Some students who lived off campus this past year described their experiences as liberating.
Molina said he enjoyed spending a year outside of the Harvard Square “bubble” and exploring the greater Boston area.
“When you’re living on campus, the incentive to leave Harvard Square is really, really small. You have everything you need. It’s really convenient. There’s no real reason to venture out,” he said. “Having to do that because I was living on my own — having to go to the gym, having to go to the grocery store — it gave me a reason to sort of venture out either in a Zipcar or on the evening van and actually get to know Cambridge and Somerville.”
“It made me really appreciate Boston and Cambridge,” he added.
Ramrajvel, who said she appreciated the freedom of living independently, said she imagines more people will consider living off campus as a viable option in the future.
“The accessibility of off-campus housing might be greater, and people might see the appeal more, especially people who have done it before or even just talking to people [who have lived off-campus],” she said. “I definitely think it comes with some more freedom.”
Not everyone is excited about the prospect of returning to campus.
Cassandra “Cassie” Wang ’23, who spent the past year at home in Belmont, Mass., said she expects challenges will come with readjusting to on-campus life.
“I think the biggest thing, besides figuring out how Covid restrictions will affect community life and social life, is just readjusting to that process of being a member on campus, fitting into the social scene, while also being able to take classes,” Wang said.
“It’ll be kind of like we’re starting college all over again,” she added.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana told The Crimson in an interview this month that he believes one of the distinctive draws of Harvard College is the residential experience.
“It’s an opportunity to live in [a] community of people with a variety of different backgrounds and experiences. It’s an opportunity to participate in the intergenerational context where students live alongside tutors and faculty deans,” Khurana said.
“A big part of what it means to be at Harvard College is simply talking to somebody who comes from a different background, who’s outside of your concentration or not somebody you might have known in the past, and then suddenly you find yourself discussing different topics,” he added.
Casas said one of her motivations for attending Harvard was its guaranteed four years of housing.
While administrators and students alike laud the College’s Housing system as an equalizer that brings students from all backgrounds to live under the same roof, some students said low-income students do not have the same flexibility to live off-campus due to financial constraints.
“Whenever you hear that someone lives off campus, you’re always like, ‘Oh, nice, so their parents are billionaires,’ just because by nature of how expensive housing is in Cambridge,” Forbes said.
Forbes said her housing decision for the fall is contingent on whether Harvard will provide financial support to students seeking off-campus accommodations.
“I’m on full financial aid, and Harvard being able to give those off-campus stipends was huge,” she said, referring to the $5,000 per semester Harvard offered students living off-campus during the past year. “I’ve definitely found living off campus a super rich and intentional way to live with people who are really important to you.”
“Part of having a full rich college experience is having the opportunity to live off campus if that’s what makes you the most comfortable or having the opportunity to build an apartment community and a life with friends that you have made after freshman year,” Forbes said.
Looking ahead to the 2021-2022 academic year, Forbes said she worries on-campus restrictions still in place due to the coronavirus — which are yet to be finalized — will have a disproportionate impact on low-income students who cannot afford to create social opportunities off campus that come at a high price tag.
“If your only option is to live on campus and living on campus, you’re not allowed to throw parties,” she said. “Higher-income peers who have the opportunities to live off campus or have the opportunities to not be suffocated by those restrictions are able to still have a full social life and still make the connections that make Harvard meaningful — that would be hugely, hugely concerning to me.”

When Harvard University President Lawrence S. Bacow was inaugurated in the fall of 2018, hundreds of students and faculty crowded into Tercentenary Theatre to celebrate his ascension to higher education’s top job.
No such gathering could be held today. This week, Tercentenary Theatre sits empty for the second consecutive year, devoid of the pomp and circumstance that traditionally fill its grounds at Commencement.
“I often say to new presidents that the biggest challenges that they will face [may] not have been anticipated on the day that they were appointed,” Bacow told The Crimson this month, reflecting on his first years in office.
For Bacow, that has meant grappling with the greatest institutional challenge Harvard has faced in a generation: Covid-19, which forced much of the University to shutter and reshaped all of its operations.
“Almost everything that I have done has been colored by the pandemic,” Bacow said.
Still, he has continued to address the priorities he outlined in his inaugural address, such as advocacy for the value of higher education, immigration, and public service — though that, too, has often been through the lens of Covid-19.
Some of the issues that he contended with before the pandemic — including calls for increased diversity among faculty and student protests in favor of ethnic studies and divestment — have also remained salient.
Three years into his term as University president, having weathered the worst of the pandemic and a fraught political climate for higher education under former U.S. president Donald Trump, Bacow has garnered praise from influential University affiliates.
“We have somebody who can meet the challenges of the unexpected,” said William F. Lee ’72, the senior fellow of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body. “He's been decisive, he’s been empathetic. But I think the most important thing to me is, he’s had one guiding principle, which has been the public health and safety of the community.”
The pandemic has had a dire impact on the finances of many colleges around the country. In February 2021, the Chronicle of Higher Education estimated that the higher education industry had taken a $183 billion hit — its most significant losses to date.
When the University first closed its campus in March 2020, experts speculated that Harvard might face the same “grave” financial future as its peers.
But Harvard appears poised to come out of the crisis with its finances largely intact — in fact, its endowment hit a record-high $41.9 billion in September 2020.
Top members of the Harvard Corporation in part credit Bacow with that achievement.
Soon after he took office, in the years before the pandemic, Bacow developed a “recession playbook” to prepare the University for the possibility of a future economic downturn.
“What Larry was able to do, in the first two years, positioned Harvard very well to manage through this crisis,” said Kenneth I. Chenault, a member of the Harvard Corporation and the chair of its finance committee.
Operationally, Bacow managed to steer a broadly steady ship through the uncharted waters of Covid-19, taking a cautious approach that prevented the major planning reversals and outbreaks that have marred other schools' reopenings.
“I think Harvard has done a reasonable job of balancing risk and the need to continue activities,” said Dyann F. Wirth, an infectious disease expert at the Harvard School of Public Health who served on the faculty advisory committee during the 2017-18 presidential search.
Since becoming one of the first schools to empty its campus when the pandemic arrived last March, Harvard has stayed true to its cautious approach of handling the coronavirus.
The approach has also kept Bacow in the good graces of the Harvard Corporation, which holds the power to appoint and fire the president and has been involved in making most major decisions throughout the pandemic.
In part, the collaborative relationship between Bacow and the Corporation stems from Bacow’s own tenure on the Corporation prior to becoming president, per Lee. After governance reforms overhauled the Corporation’s structure in 2010, the body added six new members and sought to bring “together a group of people who were culturally collegial and compatible,” Lee said in an interview last week.
“Larry was part of that,” Lee said. “The fact that he was part of this cohesive group that resulted from the governance reforms clearly provided him with a different relationship with us going forward.”
Even before the pandemic’s arrival, Bacow faced another unprecedented external threat: a fraught political environment for higher education under Trump.
Ever since American universities began collaborating with and receiving funding from the federal government during the World War II era, Harvard presidents have played a role in public affairs. Under former University President Derek C. Bok, Harvard opened a lobbying office less than a mile from Capitol Hill.
When Bacow came into office, he pledged to advocate not just for Harvard but for “all of higher education,” saying in one of his first public addresses as president, “It is our responsibility to work on behalf of others less fortunate.”
Throughout Bacow's three years in office, Harvard has been dragged into an onslaught of political and cultural wars.
Bacow inherited the 2014 lawsuit brought forth by anti-affirmative action group Student for Fair Admissions, which alleges the College’s admissions process discriminates against Asain Americans. After losses in District Court and Appeals Court, SFFA petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to take up the case. It has yet to announce if it will hear the case next term.
Under Trump, the U.S. Department of Justice also began investigating the College’s admissions process, and backed the legal challenge.
Jeannie Park ’83, co-founder of Coalition for a Diverse Harvard, commended the University’s handling of legal challenges to its race-conscious admissions practices.
“The University gets high marks throughout President Bacow’s tenure for vigorously defending race-conscious admissions against unrelenting attacks by anti-diversity forces,” she wrote in an email.
Trump himself targeted the University in 2020, calling on Harvard to return funds it had been allocated by a federal stimulus bill passed last April in response to the coronavirus crisis and castigating the school for its decision not to reopen in person in the fall.
“Harvard, for better or for worse, looms in the American imagination — and often in the global imagination — as the paradigmatic powerhouse, ultra-wealthy U.S. university,” said Steven E. Hyman, a former University Provost. “And because of the predominant, educated liberal views on campus, like all of our peers, but because of our status, we have become an irresistible target for a manipulative, populist administration.”
“I think Larry, frankly, navigated that really well,” Hyman added.
The University has picked its battles with the Trump administration, succumbing to pressure to not accept federal stimulus dollars last April and steering clear of rhetorical fights, but oftentimes engaging on immigration issues.
Harvard, along with MIT, sued federal immigration authorities last summer over a rule that would bar international students attending universities with online-only courses from residing in the U.S. The decision to sue, which ultimately resulted in the Trump administration rescinding the rule, marked a key point in Bacow’s tenure, and an inflection point in the University’s relationship with the federal government under Trump.
“I think Larry has been very, very strategic in his decisions about when to engage and when not,” said Shirley M. Tilghman, a member of the Harvard Corporation who formerly served as president of Princeton University. “I think the principle that Larry has used is the right principle, which is when an issue that arises outside the gates of Harvard Yard [has] a significant impact on the University itself, that is when it is, I think, entirely appropriate to engage."
Prior to his selection, students and affiliates hoped the University’s 29th leader might be as historic as its 28th. Former President Drew G. Faust was the first female president in Harvard's then-371 year history. A person of color has yet to helm the University.
For that reason, the choice of another white male was a disappointment to some students and affiliates. Still, Bacow has acknowledged the importance of diversity and inclusion from day one.
“We need to look for the very best and, during my time at Tufts, I’m proud of the record of bringing women and minorities and people of color into the senior leadership, into the faculty, and also into the student body, and I hope to do the same thing here,” Bacow said at a press conference the day his selection as president was announced.
His appointment coincided with the close of the University-wide diversity task force convened under Faust, which charged a team of affiliates with examining the University’s demographics, culture, resource distribution, and organizational structures.
Following the task force’s recommendations, Bacow agreed with Faust to designate $10 million to faculty recruitment and renewal efforts in 2018 and appointed the first chief diversity and inclusion officer in 2020.
Yet, since 2018, the percentage of tenured and tenure-track faculty who are women has increased by just 1 and 2 percent, respectively. Faust saw the percent of female tenured faculty grow by 6 percent throughout her 11 year term.
The percentage of tenure-track faculty who are underrepresented minorities has also increased just 1 percent over the last three years; there has been no change in the percent of tenured faculty.
In a recent interview, Bacow noted faculty hiring occurs within Harvard’s individual schools and departments, and pointed to senior positions filled by women, including seven of the University’s 15 deans.
“Faculty turns over slowly, so if you just look at the overall composition of the faculty, it appears to be changing slower than if you look at the new appointments that we’ve made over the course of the last 15 or 20 years,” Bacow said.
Since his selection as president, Bacow has continued to face letters, rallies, and criticism in the nearly half-century long campaign for a formalized ethnic studies program.
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay commented last year that the University’s ongoing search for four senior faculty members and two annual visiting professors specializing in ethnic studies was a necessary first step to open the door for the possibility of building such a program.
But the seats remain unfilled and an ethnic studies department unbuilt — a fact that Park, the co-founder of Coalition for a Diverse Harvard, called a “serious concern.”
“After the events of the past year, the need for every Harvard student to graduate with an academic grounding in the understanding of race and ethnicity is beyond obvious,” she wrote.
The first 100 days of Bacow’s tenure featured the new president helping eager freshmen carry boxes into their new dorms, taking selfies with students, and joining groups of joggers along the Charles River. With the onset of Covid-19 and the shift to remote University operations over the last year, Bacow's ability to interact with students has been significantly reduced.
Undergraduate Council President Noah A. Harris ’22 and Vice President Jenny Y. Gan ’22 meet with Bacow once a semester to discuss concerns affecting the undergraduate student body. Harris wrote in an email he would like to see all students offered increased accessibility to the president through the remainder of Bacow’s term.
“While President Bacow is responsible for communicating with and managing Harvard as a whole, we do believe that it would be beneficial for undergraduates to gain more face-time with President Bacow in the form of town halls, question-and-answer sessions, open office hours, and other similar initiatives,” he wrote. “As a result, students could gain insight into President Bacow’s priorities, the work his office is doing, and so on.”
Former University President Lawrence H. Summers held first-come, first-serve office hours for students in his Massachusetts Hall office up to five times per semester. Faust similarly held office hours open to students and staff twice per semester.
Bacow previously offered office hour sessions for students in 2018 and 2019 but has stopped during the pandemic. Throughout his tenure, Bacow has engaged with students as a freshman advisor and as a guest lecturer.
Outside of office hours, student activists also allege that Bacow and the Harvard Corporation have repeatedly refused to engage in conversations about fossil fuel divestment.
Ilana A. Cohen ’22-’23, an organizer for student group Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard, said there has been “very little to no meaningful communication” between Bacow, the Corporation, and the divestment campaign.
“Our campaign is and always has been completely open to communication both with President Bacow and the Harvard Corporation,” Cohen said.
Bacow and divest activists have met to discuss the campaign on numerous occasions, including a 2019 meeting in which Bacow stated he would respond only to “reason” and “not demands.” In April 2019, he made a surprise appearance at a forum hosted by Divest Harvard in which he debated the feasibility of divestment with faculty members — an event Cohen described at the time as an “invaluable night." The parties last met in December 2020.
Divest Harvard has also criticized the process by which Bacow selects the student members of his advisory bodies, such as the Presidential Committee on Sustainability and the Advisory Committee on Shareholder Responsibility, calling it “secretive.”
Bacow’s favorability among graduating seniors rose over his first two years in office, but sank this year amid a pandemic that kept most students from campus for at least one semester, according to surveys by The Crimson.
In 2018, when Bacow was president-elect, 27 percent of graduating seniors held a favorable view of him, though two-thirds reported not having enough information or holding no opinion.
In 2019, his approval rose to 37 percent, and it reached 44 percent in 2020. This year, his favorability fell to a mere 22 percent. More than 40 percent of graduating seniors said they have an unfavorable view of Bacow — the highest at any point in his presidency.
In contrast, faculty surveyed by The Crimson have reported an increasingly positive view of Bacow throughout his tenure and the pandemic. Between 2020 and 2021, his approval rating among faculty members rose from 39 to 48 percent. The proportion of faculty who reported that Bacow has represented their interests well also increased slightly, from 25 to 31 percent.
Bacow lauded “marvelous” students, “creative” faculty, and “selfless” staff at the University for their adaptability to the unusual circumstances of the pandemic.
“I think if anything, the last year has demonstrated to all of us the need to be flexible, the need to be able to anticipate the unanticipated and to try to be nimble and react quickly,” Bacow said. “And I think all of us have tried to do that.”
Asked if retirement is in the picture, Bacow quipped, “I’m just trying to get through this year.”

For nearly 15 months, the Covid-19 pandemic has halted everyday life in the United States and much of the world. As in-person interactions shifted to screens, tens of millions of people were forced to adapt to life under the persistent threat of a lethal virus. Although vaccines have tempered cases, Americans have been subjected to a year of isolation and uncertainty, taking a significant toll on their mental health.
Researchers, clinical psychologists, and practicing psychiatrists at Harvard-affiliated hospitals have attempted to quantify and respond to the unprecedented national anguish while addressing persistent inequities in access to mental health resources and care.
More than 41 percent of Americans over the age of 18 reported symptoms of anxiety or depression during the pandemic, compared to 10.8 percent of adults in 2019, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
“Those levels are kind of unprecedented in modern times,” said Christopher M. Palmer, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.
Rates of post-traumatic stress disorder and substance abuse have also skyrocketed, in addition to major risk factors of mental illness such as intimate partner violence and child abuse, according to Jordan W. Smoller ’83, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and a professor of epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health.
Many whose symptoms go undiagnosed do not recognize that they have a mental health problem, according to Palmer. Instead, they see their mental distress as a temporary result of the pandemic and the stringent measures that come with it — like lockdown, quarantine, and masks.
Regardless, the mental health symptoms accrued over the past year are set to pose a significant public health challenge in the years to come.
Umadevi Naidoo, the director of Nutritional and Lifestyle Psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital, dubbed mental health issues the “silent pandemic”: out of the daily headlines but a serious threat to the public.
Psychiatrists and clinical psychologists at Harvard hospitals have observed these national trends in their own patients, according to Gregory L. Fricchione, the associate chief of psychiatry at MGH.
Palmer agreed, noting many of his own patients reported increased symptoms throughout the pandemic, including feeling more isolated, frustrated, depressed, despondent, and hopeless.
These symptoms have crossed generational lines, but have been particularly pronounced among young people, who have sacrificed significant milestones in their lives to combat a virus that poses less of a physical threat to their demographic.
In a survey, Cindy H. Liu, an assistant professor of pediatrics at the Medical School, found that 40 to 45 percent of surveyed young adults across the country reported experiencing mental distress.
Liu said the anxieties and disruptions caused by the Covid-19 era — from the fear of transmitting the virus to loved ones to the loss of in-person graduations — took a toll on young people's well-being.
“There’s an entire generation that missed all of those fun things that the rest of us have had,” Naidoo said. “None of it happened, and it’s like taking a piece of someone’s history out.”
Young people were also unsettled by the social and political unrest that rippled across the nation over the past year, according to Liu.
Older people also experienced psychological repercussions of a remote year. Many feared their increased vulnerability to the virus and struggled to use technology to engage with loved ones, according to Daiane B. Machado, a research fellow in Global Health and Social Medicine at the Medical School.
“Many older people had to stay locked at home, and many of them don’t have access to technology, or if they do, they find it much more difficult to use,” Machado said.
“They were not seeing their family, they were not having the support they needed. They got very anxious, many had very poor quality sleep, and some got depressed especially as the pandemic continued,” added Zeina N. Chemali, a professor of psychiatry and neurology at the Medical School.
Americans seeking care during the current crisis have encountered long-standing racial, economic, and geographic inequities that plague the country’s mental health care system, which has struggled to respond to the unprecedented national distress.
“Even before the pandemic, the mental health care system in the U.S. and indeed around the world was failing to meet the needs of the majority of people who are affected by mental health problems,” said Vikram H. Patel, a global health professor at the Medical School. “The need has now absolutely boomed because of the pandemic, and the system as it is is completely incapable of addressing this need.”
In the U.S., people of color, low-income populations, and those with pre-existing mental health conditions are disproportionately experiencing the psychological fallout of the pandemic, according to Smoller.
Some clinicians have sought to directly reach out to vulnerable groups. A program at Massachusetts General Hospital called Community Psychiatry PRIDE, directed by clinical psychologist Luana Marques, aims to implement evidence-based treatments to increase quality mental health care access in underserved populations.
Before the pandemic began, Marques and her team trained non-licensed professionals to deliver cognitive behavioral therapy, a form of treatment that involves changing destructive thinking patterns. As the pandemic raged in lower-income communities, these newly-trained mental health professionals were deployed to help struggling young people build emotional recognition and resilience skills.
The shift to telemedicine has also helped clinicians expand the reach of mental health services. The ability to provide care virtually has been a “godsend,” according to John B. Herman, the associate chief of psychiatry at MGH.
Prior to the pandemic, only around 5 percent of all patient visits at MGH were virtual. Within the first month of the pandemic, nearly 95 percent of visits were virtual, Smoller said.
“For a lot of people who are practitioners and patients, it’s just a lot more convenient,” Patel said. “Rates of non-attendance have dropped, and more importantly, the cost to patients has dropped because they no longer have to take time off and travel to hospitals and then wait for a long time.”
Telemedicine in psychiatric practices, however, can have notable downsides. The effectiveness of virtual consultations is limited by the privacy and comfort levels individuals have in their own homes, according to S. Bryn Austin, a professor at HSPH.
“If someone lives in a home where there’s a lot of other people there, maybe there’s multiple families in a home, they don’t have a private space to be able to do tele-mental health care — they still don't have access,” Austin said.
“We cannot assume that telemedicine is going to be the great equalizer,” Patel added. “It could in fact be the opposite.”
When talking on screens, clinicians cannot use physical touch and gestures to connect with their patients. Chemali said that many of her elderly clients value one-on-one intimate communication, including smiling, shaking hands, and getting to know their physician.
Palmer also said he found it difficult to communicate effectively through Zoom.
“Sitting with another human being in person is a very different experience than sitting with someone on Zoom,” he said. “You don't make eye contact on Zoom. If you’re trying to make eye contact, it means that you’re looking at a camera, and you’re not looking at the person — and you miss out on all of the other nonverbal body language.”
Furthermore, telehealth can be difficult for patients in remote areas without reliable internet access, further entrenching geographic and economic disparities.
“There is still a digital divide in this country where not everybody has access to all the technology or the bandwidth — literally the bandwidth — to make use of that,” Smoller said.
Austin said these challenges illustrate the necessity of developing strategies for telehealth care.
“The job’s not done yet. We have to make sure that it’s maintained, and that we continue to solve these dilemmas around economic inequities and who has access to internet and having safe spaces to be able to have these appointments,” Austin said.
Even before Covid-19, America was embroiled in a mental health crisis. Though rates of suicide and substance abuse disorders have been skyrocketing for years, Americans still struggle to access treatment.
To respond to the current moment, psychiatrists and psychologists affiliated with Harvard said they believe the University should take a proactive role in promoting mental health and wellness.
Bizu Gelaye, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the Medical School, said he believes Harvard should remain alert for mental health symptoms among its students, faculty, and staff, and continue to provide mental health resources to the general public.
“I hope Harvard continues to provide training for their students and create safe spaces for building resilience — promoting mental health is important,” Gelaye said. “I’m encouraged by those initiatives. I hope they don’t stop because this is just the tip of the iceberg.”
Liu said psychiatry research efforts should be future-facing in order to provide effective mental health care even after the pandemic.
“We need to think five steps ahead and go, ‘What would life be like in six months to a year? And what is it that we need to collect now in order to provide an understanding for what is next and how best to serve patients, members of the communities, and students at that point?’” Liu said.
Addressing the preexisting stigma around mental health is another crucial step in responding to the crisis, according to Naidoo.
“There's a lot of shame associated with not feeling good emotionally, and what happened with the pandemic is that there were certain points that showed us that individuals are struggling,” Naidoo said.
According to Karestan C. Koenen, a professor of psychiatric epidemiology at the School of Public Health, the pandemic has illustrated the importance of mental health for overall well-being.
“I think this has made it more evident, again, how important our mental health is — it’s usually as a side note, you don’t think about it until you have a problem with it,” Koenen said. “Mental health is the foundation of all health.”

View the results of The Crimson's Class of 2021 Senior Survey here. 
When the Class of 2021 graduates tomorrow, it will have witnessed two Harvard and U.S. presidencies, seven new pairs of faculty deans in the Houses, and at least one AirPod theft in Harvard Yard. Perhaps most notably, many of this year’s graduates vacated their dorms in March 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic and never returned, spending nearly three semesters of college with little physical connection to campus.
That absence has apparently failed to make seniors’ view of Harvard fonder. University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s favorability rating dropped from 44 percent among the Class of 2020 to just 22 percent among the Class of 2021, according to survey results. Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana’s favorability rating also dropped, dipping from 50 to 40 percent. Those figures may stem in part from frustration over Harvard’s decision to hold online degree-granting ceremonies this year, making it one of only two Ivy League colleges to eschew in-person celebrations. Eighty-four percent of surveyed seniors said they viewed virtual graduation unfavorably, and nearly half said they disapproved of Prairie View A&M University President Ruth J. Simmons, this year’s marquee speaker. Only 57 percent of surveyed seniors said they plan to attend an in-person celebration for the Class should Harvard hold one next year.
Each year, The Crimson conducts a survey of Harvard College’s graduating class, collecting data about where they are headed next, how they spent their time at Harvard, and what they think of the College and the country. The Crimson distributed this year’s edition to 1,506 seniors via email and garnered 509 responses, representing a response rate of 34 percent. The survey remained open from May 12 to May 24 and was anonymous. The Crimson did not adjust the data for possible non-response bias.
Despite reporting some regrets about their choice of roommates, classes, and concentration — and despite their ire toward administrators — seniors were content with their choice of college. Given the chance, 93 percent of seniors said they would choose Harvard again.
Compare this year’s results to the Class of 2020.
As various University graduate programs reduced or completely paused admissions during the past application cycle, many faculty across Harvard’s schools expressed concern for the health of their programs, both in the short and long run.
In response to pressures brought forth by the pandemic — including reduced funding, a lackluster academic job market, and pressures on faculty time — many graduate programs across the nation announced they would reduce the number of students admitted to programs that begin in the fall of 2021.
However, unlike some peer institutions that wholly paused admissions — including Harvard’s own Graduate School of Education doctoral program — the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences announced in October 2020 that they would be taking a “more balanced approach to admissions.”
GSAS Dean Emma Dench wrote in a statement to The Crimson that leadership across the University elected to reduce admissions with an eye toward their commitments to current students.
“Unlike our peer institutions, some of whom have announced pauses on admissions to whole clusters of graduate student programs for fall 2021, GSAS, SEAS, and FAS leadership resolved to take a more balanced approach to admissions, one that aims to preserve our research and intellectual goals as much as possible, while keeping our focus on the academic success of our current students,” she wrote.
Ultimately, only five departments did not admit any students for programs that would otherwise begin this fall. Nonetheless, The Crimson found that Harvard faculty across multiple departments reported anxiety about the robustness of their programs following the admissions changes.
In November 2020, American Studies, Anthropology, Film and Visual Studies, Germanic Languages and Literatures, and South Asian Studies each announced on GSAS’s website that they would suspend admissions for the 2020-21 cycle “due to the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the importance of supporting current students.”
Unclear at the time of GSAS’s announcement was the extent to which admissions reductions would affect other departments.
The Crimson distributed a survey this month to graduate program coordinators in 60 departments across the University. A total of 28 participants answered at least one question, while 12 participants completed every question in the survey. The respondents’ departments — whose average target cohort sizes decreased 33 percent — made 40 percent fewer admissions offers this cycle.
Ultimately, 29 percent fewer first-year graduate students in the respondents’ programs will participate in matriculation exercises this fall as compared to last year in the respondents’ departments.
The majority of respondents said that — to the best of their knowledge — administrators did not consult them on their department’s cohort size reduction. Just two respondents reported they were allowed feedback.
Several of the graduate coordinators reported concerns about how the changes would affect their department’s scholarship and student experience.
Jeffrey Miron, Economics senior lecturer and director of undergraduate studies, said the admissions pause will likely not pose a significant threat to his department’s health if numbers normalize in the next cycle.
“If it only happens for this one year, and we went back to prior practice, the impact would have to be fairly small because, roughly, students stay in the program five to six years,” he said. “If you make one of those five cohorts slightly smaller, it’s not really challenging the size or composition or nature of the graduate program.”
However, Matthew J. Liebmann, American Archaeology and Ethnology professor and Anthropology director of graduate studies, wrote in an email that the complete pause in admissions for his department will render it “difficult to mount our curriculum as it is designed.” He cited “challenges to our ability to hold robust discussions in graduate seminars” as an immediate impact of the pause.
Likewise, Kay K. Shelemay, Music professor and director of graduate studies, expressed similar concern. In an email, she wrote that the Music department traditionally “usually made 10-12 offers to get a class of 8-10” but only was able to make 4 offers and yield 4 matriculating students this cycle.
“Our department has five programs, so in the short term it meant that one of our programs did not get a student,” she wrote.
Despite the negative effects on their departments, some respondents also said they would not have had the resources to take in a normal cohort due to the pandemic, and wanted to support current students, especially given the tight academic job market.
Deans within the Faculty of Arts and Sciences — including Claudine Gay, Emma Dench, and Lawrence D. Bobo — maintained that accepting a regular number of students despite the financial restrictions induced by the pandemic would affect the resources afforded to current students. In an October 2020 email to FAS faculty announcing the reductions, the deans said they would commit to supporting current students in an increasingly fraught job market.
“In numerous fields, too—particularly those heavily dependent on the academic job market—employment outcomes that were already challenging before the COVID-19 crisis are now severely affected,” they wrote in the email. “We consider it our ethical responsibility not to exacerbate these problems by taking a full cohort of new students.”
Many faculty members also expressed that the reduction in admissions — even if just one year — could have many negative long-term implications.
Liebmann wrote that his department’s admissions pause exposes it to a number of challenges, some of which include a dearth of teaching fellows, the loss of promising students to peer institutions, and an overall decrease in the quality of the collaborative learning environments and networking opportunities.
Jewish History professor Derek J. Penslar wrote in response to the survey that, though the effect of the admissions reduction was minor for the Center for Middle Eastern Studies, he is more concerned about the continuously decreasing admissions statistics in the History department.
“The damage to CMES caused by reductions in Ph.D. admissions is, at this point, relatively minor,” Penslar wrote. “I am far more concerned about my home department, History, which has seen its admissions quota reduced in recent years from 18 to 13, and now (for F21) to 6. These reductions have a powerful negative effect on departmental standing and the quality of graduate and undergraduate education alike.”
Other respondents indicated worries about the comparative competitiveness of Harvard’s programs as a result of a decreased cohort size and the message it would send about the University’s support for the next generation of academics.
Miron noted that a prolonged reduction in graduate admissions may lead to a number of long-term complications, including the number and quality of department courses, as well as a dearth of invested teaching fellows, many of whom are graduate students.
“To continue to stay at a smaller level, there are a number of effects. The classes will be smaller. And that might have implications for how many classes get offered,” Miron said. “Most obviously, our ability to provide high-quality teaching fellows to the undergraduate and graduate courses is going to be a little bit more challenging if we have a smaller incoming class.”
Despite these challenges, Harvard administrators maintain that the graduate admission reductions and pauses serve Harvard and its individual programs in the long term. In their October email to FAS faculty, the FAS deans wrote that the current “reset” would work to “preserve Harvard’s excellence.”
“This is an opportunity to reset our graduate admissions process, evaluate how we are serving our graduate students, and ensure that we are setting them up for success as students and as alumni, regardless of program or stage in program,” the administrators wrote.
“By taking these steps, we will work together to preserve Harvard’s excellence and continue fostering the intellectual talent that drives it,” they concluded.
For this story, The Crimson collected electronic responses through Qualtrics, an online survey platform, from May 10 to May 24, 2021. A link to the anonymous survey was sent to 60 FAS and SEAS faculty members affiliated with graduate programs. Of those faculty, 41 accessed the link to the survey. A total of 28 participants answered at least one question, while 12 participants completed every question in the survey.
The Crimson allowed survey participants to select their preference for attribution: Respondents could opt to anonymize their submission and present their department’s data only for analysis in the aggregate, present their department’s data but without their name, or use the department’s data and their name.
To prevent participants from accidentally taking the survey more than once, The Crimson enabled Qualtrics’ browser cookie functionality to register unique survey sessions on each device. This device data is controlled by Qualtrics, and The Crimson does not retain information that could identify devices accessing the survey with anonymous responses.

On February 29, 2012 — in front of packed rows of students, policymakers, and nonprofit leaders — Lady Gaga and Oprah Winfrey stood on the stage of Harvard’s Sanders Theatre and officially launched the Born This Way Foundation.
The foundation, established by Gaga and her mother, partnered with Harvard’s Berkman Center, the California Endowment, and the MacArthur Foundation explore methods for fostering a “culture of kindness, bravery, acceptance, and empowerment,” according to a press release at the time.
However, some affiliates were not there to see Gaga or Winfrey. As the two celebrities entered the gates of the University in limousines, a group of Harvard affiliates stood in the frigid weather holding signs that read, “Harvard Expelled Gay People in 1920” and “Harvard Persecuted Gay People in 1920.”
The affiliates — part of a movement titled Their Day in the Yard, launched in 2010 by then-anonymous Extension School student Jennifer M. Grygiel — were holding a demonstration in honor of a seldom-addressed aspect of Harvard’s history: the Secret Court of 1920.
A covert ad-hoc tribunal that had bypassed the University’s traditional disciplinary bureaucracy, the Secret Court remained largely unknown on campus until then-undergraduate student Amit R. Paley ’04 published an investigative report in The Crimson’s Fifteen Minutes Magazine in the fall of 2002. His article was the result of a six-month effort by Fifteen Minutes to gain access to 500 pages of redacted files.
It all began on May 13, 1920, when undergraduate Cyril Wilcox was found dead in his bedroom after asphyxiating gas — a common method of death by suicide at the time. Following his brother’s death, George L. Wilcox, Class of 1914, traveled to Boston to question Harry Dreyfus, whom he had discovered was his late brother’s lover. After finding and beating Dreyfus, and extracting from him names of others involved, he went on to inform then-Acting Dean of the College Chester N. Greenough, Class of 1898. From there, the Secret Court was born.
The clandestine Court — helmed by Greenough, and comprised of five administrators — ultimately went on to try dozens of University affiliates over a two-month period, finding 14 individuals “guilty” of either being involved in or proximate to what Greenough termed “any homosexual act.”
In a letter to the father of Joseph E. Lumbard, Jr., Class of 1922, one of the students mandated by the Court to leave campus, Greenough conceded that, though Lumbard was “innocent of any homosexual act,” he was “too closely connected” with those who were guilty. He explained that Lumbard was reported to have attended a party with other men under suspicion, and served as a “link in the chain” by facilitating communications between individuals, according to the initial investigative report.
During these trials, the Court presided over interviews, many of which included personal questions related to topics like sexual relations and masturbation.
Beginning June 4, 1920, Greenough — backed by then-University President Abbott Lawrence Lowell, Class of 1877 — decided on “guilty” verdicts for 14 of the men tried, seven of whom were college students and four of whom were not affiliated with Harvard. Convicted students were not merely expelled from campus; they were also mandated to depart immediately from the city of Cambridge.
Two of the men tried and convicted by the Court — Eugene R. Cummings and Keith Smerage — died by suicide on June 11, 1920, and Sept. 8, 1930, respectively.
In 2012, the demonstrators at Their Day in the Yard urged attendees of the Born This Way Foundation’s launch to recognize the history of the Secret Court.
Following the demonstration, the group of affiliates proceeded to the office of former University President Drew G. Faust, presenting her with a petition demanding that the University award the victims of the Court with posthumous honorary degrees. In an interview with The Crimson in September 2010, Faust acknowledged the history of the Court, but emphasized the importance of focusing on future actions.
“What should Harvard do about things in the past? Issues like excluding women or Blacks? There’s a long history — how do you think about what the past has been?” Faust said. “What I’d like to do is to direct our attention and learn from the past in order to inspire ourselves to be better in the future, because the present and the future is what matters.”
Others believe addressing the University’s homophobic past by awarding posthumous honorary degrees to victims of the Court is essential for an equitable present and future.
Grygiel — the founder of Their Day in the Yard and now a professor at Syracuse University — continues to hope for the conferral of the honorary degrees.
“If there’s an injustice, it’s still an injustice until it’s corrected,” Grygiel said.
The Secret Court of 1920 was unknown to most faculty and students before Paley exposed it in 2002, according to Lecturer on Education and Public Policy Timothy P. McCarthy ’93.
“I certainly had never heard of any of that. And most people I knew had never heard of anything like that,” McCarthy said. “It produced a kind of reckoning with Harvard’s own institutional complicity, not just in queer history, but in the persecution of queer people, and then the erasure of the history of the persecution of queer people. It forced not just a reckoning, but a recognition.”
Two consecutive University Presidents — Lawrence H. Summers and Faust — have resisted the awarding of posthumous honorary degrees to victims of the Court.
McCarthy, who has championed the awarding of the degrees, said the University’s rationale — that it does not provide degrees to those who did not complete their education — runs counter to its past actions.
“This isn’t that these folks decided to leave,” McCarthy said. “These are people who were pushed out of the University because there was some speculation that they were engaged in what was called at the time ‘unnatural acts,’ that they were suspected of homosexuality — none of them were caught in the act.”
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment this month on the possibility of awarding posthumous honorary degrees to victims of the Court.
Others at the University have experienced the history of the Court by being surrounded, quite literally, by monuments to figures from that era.
Harvard Divinity School and Study of Religion professor Diana L. Eck — who served as faculty dean of Lowell House from 1998 to 2018 — said she felt as though she were “living with Lowells,” surrounded by their portraiture while residing over the House with her wife Dorothy Austin.
Eck — who noted that Abbott Lawrence Lowell’s sister, Amy Lowell, was herself romantically involved with actor Ada Dwyer Russell — said she and her wife hosted a “queer tea” every year to signal to BGLTQ students that they were welcome in Lowell House.
“The fact that [Lowell] was president during the time of the Secret Court and the purge of these gay men was very disquieting,” she said. “It became very much a part of the story that we told about Lowell House whenever we had new sophomores, junior events, seniors dinners, faculty dinners.”
The history of the Secret Court has attracted the attention of scholars beyond the gates of Harvard — and even the United States.
Mia Liyanage — who recently completed her Master’s degree at Oxford University — accessed the original files of the Secret Court of 1920, the redacted versions of which were made available to Paley in 2002. Her scholarship on the ad-hoc tribunal not only examines the punitive proceedings of the Court, but also focuses on locating moments of what she terms “queer euphoria” in the written exchanges of the convicted men with friends and family.
“What is central about the Secret Court is that it is an extremely rare example where within the umbrella of a persecution narrative, there is actually unadulterated evidence of positive queer identity, queer euphoria, queer community,” she said. “You get a very rare, unfiltered look into the way these men thought about themselves.”
For Liyanage, the identification of joy and agency in these men’s accounts are important not merely for the historical analysis of this moment, but also for the study of BGLTQ rights at large.
“Most archival evidence that points to queerness as a broad concept is pejorative for want of a better term — it is based on persecution,” she said. “One of the biggest challenges to queer history scholars for the future liberation and empowerment of the modern-day queer community, which I think is a central pillar of most queer historians’ work, is finding the agency in those records.”
Grygiel — who began Their Day in the Yard anonymously during their time as an Extension School student — first learned about the Secret Court around Commencement, with the awarding of the annual Eugene R. Cummings Senior Thesis Prize in LGBT Studies. Upon further examination, Grygiel realized Cummings was one of the students who had died by suicide after his encounter with the Secret Court.
“That’s when I learned about the history of the Secret Court. And I was like, ‘Wow, that’s really terrible. Why aren’t we doing more about that?’” they said.
Grygiel said they would like a formal investigation made into the tribunal.
“This is such an egregious matter — we need a full investigation, and that hasn’t happened. And so I want a report,” they said. “We need them not to just say, ‘Sorry,’ but did it persist for many years? How many students were impacted? And how will the University be clearing their names, and making this right?”
Grygiel pointed to the fact that other individuals who willingly dropped out before completing their Harvard undergraduate education — including Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates — have received honorary degrees.
A petition on Change.org created in 2012 by members of Their Day in the Yard that called for the awarding of posthumous honorary degrees has amassed 24,653 signatures.
Since Their Day in the Yard, others at the University have contributed to building the momentum of honoring the history of the Secret Court.
Secret Court 100 — a group formed by Harvard students and faculty in 2020 to acknowledge the centennial of the Court — aims to inform affiliates about the Court’s history, achieve institutional recognition of the Court, and promote a safer, more supportive environment for BGLTQ students across the University.
Last year, to honor the centennial, Secret Court 100 organized a number of virtual panels as part of an event series titled “Secret Court 100: Harvard’s Queer History,” which united students, professors, and alumni to explore the past and present experiences of BGLTQ individuals at Harvard and beyond.
The group’s website also outlines institutional demands that include the conferral of posthumous honorary degrees to the victims, the establishment of an endowed commemorative fund for queer history research, and the removal of the portraiture of Greenough, the former Acting Dean, from Dunster House.
Russell H. Reed ’20, one of the founders of Secret Court 100, said the idea for the group emerged from conversations with McCarthy.
“I was probably in my sophomore, if not junior, year when I found out about it,” he said. “I started talking to friends about it, and nobody knew about it. I spoke to faculty who had never heard about it, too. I was really surprised.”
For Reed, some of the most memorable moments with Secret Court 100 were not just the panels, but also the planning meetings in which students and faculty came together to foster a collaborative space.
“We all got together in the BGLTQ Office,” he said. “Quite a few of us were together — there were 10 to 15 of us in this room, all smushed in. And we started talking about what this history was, what we wanted to do, what it meant. What was really exciting about that conversation for me was that it felt like this really unique experience, being around so many other engaged and a really diverse group of queer students, faculty, and administrators.”
Students involved in the Secret Court 100 split into subgroups, each delegated distinct tasks. For Diego Garcia Blum, a student at the Kennedy School, the work was focused on outreach. In the days following the 2020 presidential election, Garcia Blum wrote an opinion piece in the Washington Blade to inform readers of the history of the Secret Court and urge them to support President Joe Biden, who promised to sign the Equality Act. The proposed act would prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity.
“We need to realize that it was part of Harvard’s policies back then, and own that. And I think moving forward, being able to use that story to highlight the mental health issues that come with being young and coming out of the closet, being bullied in different places especially because you’re LBGTQ,” Garcia Blum said.
“We want to honor the people that were harmed by the Secret Court,” he added. “We want to honor the fact that they didn’t deserve that, that they were part of a witch hunt for nothing but who they were.”
One hundred years after the Secret Court, past and present Harvard affiliates continue to cite the necessity of increased institutional support for BGLTQ students.
Paley — who later served as president of The Crimson and is now the CEO of The Trevor Project, a suicide prevention and crisis intervention service for queer youth — said some of the ways schools and universities can support BGLTQ students include committing funding for BGLTQ offices, normalizing the sharing and respecting of pronouns, establishing all-gender restrooms, and prioritizing mental health care.
“An issue that is very relevant — and particularly relevant to LGBTQ people, and that ties into many of the stories of the students that were impacted by the Secret Court — is the importance of mental health support and suicide prevention efforts for all students, particularly people of marginalized identities, and specifically LGBTQ people who are at much higher risk of suicide than folks who are not,” Paley said.
Current Harvard students also said they would like to see more resources dedicated explicitly to BGLTQ needs.
GSAS Student Council president Alexis G. Turner — a Ph.D. student in the History of Science — said while they support ongoing advising initiatives for graduate departments, they would also like to see the hiring of staff members whose sole responsibility is to support BGLTQ students. Such roles already exist at other institutions, according to Turner.
“As long as the GSAS administration is not given the budget from above to do what they need, all of their initiatives are going to be putting band-aids on a larger problem,” they said.
In an emailed statement, the student organization LGBTQ@GSAS said recent surveys of graduate students have illuminated the need for increased institutional support for BGLTQ students.
“In previous years, the administration has declined to commit these resources citing the lack of quantitative data,” the statement reads. “The data are now available, and we are impatient for action and to work with our allies in the administration to secure the resources LGBTQ+ students and students of color need to thrive at Harvard.”
Ann Hall, a spokesperson for GSAS, said the School is assessing recent student mental health data and actively working on solutions.
The GSAS Office of Diversity and Minority Affairs currently works with Diversity and Inclusion Fellows to support student groups, including BGLTQ students. The University’s Office for Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging hosts drop-in chats for BGLTQ students as well, among other initiatives.
For Grygiel, it is significant that the Court occurred within Harvard’s gates. Grygiel points to Harvard’s institutional influence as an additional reason why it should award the degrees, thereby setting an example for others to follow.
“The thing about Harvard is that it’s renowned — it’s Harvard. They’re a leader in not just education, but our society. And so if Harvard can’t get it right, how can we hope that other institutions will?” Grygiel said. “That’s why it’s very important to hold Harvard accountable, for them to keep being pressed on this topic. And I still think that they have not made this right.”
Paley said that while honoring the history of the Court, it is also important to recognize that there are stories similar to the Secret Court that will never be revealed.
“We happen to know about the Secret Court of 1920 because it was written down and recorded, and through a series of relatively unusual reasons, these notes were kept and were not destroyed,” he said. “But the Secret Court and the discrimination that those students face was not unique. There were many, many other examples of that. We just don’t know what they all were, because they were either not recorded, or they were recorded, but then the documentation was lost or destroyed.”
McCarthy said the reluctance of University administrators to acknowledge the history of the Secret Court suggests a fear that “other histories will be unearthed” — ones that bring to the fore hardships faced by other marginalized groups including immigrants, low-income students, and people of color.
“My response to that is, ‘And? Why is that a problem?’ That is a project of reparations. That’s a project of repairing, of restoring, of honoring, of reconciling, of reckoning with the institution’s own complex history,” he said. “And that’s what we should be doing, is shining a light on that. And certainly as a historian, that’s my job. That’s what I was trained to do.”
“And so we’ll continue to do that, regardless of whether or not the Harvard administration accepts our argument or awards these degrees posthumously,” McCarthy added. “We’ll keep telling the truth — we’ll keep pressing for justice.”

For residents of Boston and its constituent neighborhoods, their proximity to the Charles River, Boston Harbor, and the Atlantic Ocean has long been an asset.
But as global temperatures steadily increase, experts predict that the resulting sea level rise and flooding will encroach on the Greater Boston Area — including Harvard’s campus.
Over the past century, sea levels increased by “nine inches relative to land,” according to a 2016 study commissioned by the City of Boston. The current rate of sea level rise, however, has significantly accelerated: the report projects that, from 2016 to 2030, the rate of sea level rise could triple, resulting in an eight inch increase relative to land.
Furthermore, the city estimates that water levels could be three feet higher in 2070 than they were in 2000, if they continue to rise at their current pace.
As sea levels rise, the report adds, floods become more frequent and severe. Annualized losses, per the city, from a three-foot increase in water and the ensuing flooding could amount to nearly $1.39 billion.
Harvard, with its sprawling campus and proximity to the Charles River, has long been at risk of damage from sea level rise and coastal flooding.
Before Harvard owned more land in Boston than in Cambridge, much of the Allston area the University has recently developed was low-lying marshland patterned by nuisance flooding.
Atop the land where farmers used to grow water-loving crops now stands the Business School, the Athletic Complex, the newly completed $1 billion Science and Engineering Complex, and dozens of other structures planned or recently built.
As Harvard churned out these developments, the City of Boston’s 2016 Climate Ready Boston report named Allston the Charles River neighborhood with the highest near-term flooding exposure. In 2013, the World Bank ranked Boston as the eighth city globally most vulnerable to flooding.
William N. “Will” Brownsberger ’78, president pro tempore of the Massachusetts Senate, whose constituency includes some Allston neighborhoods, said developments downstream of the Charles River Dam are among the areas vulnerable to flooding in the next three decades.
“They thought they were building a dam that would hold back basically any storm,” Brownsberger said of the dam’s construction.
But by around 2050, he said, there is a “material risk” the dams will “be overtopped or flanked.”
Harvard Graduate School of Design urban design professor Alex Krieger has sat on several committees involved in Harvard’s expansion into Allston. Krieger said developers are doing “as much as one can” given what they know about Boston’s climate scenario.
Raising ground levels by two feet, installing stormwater management systems, and building with rainfall-permeable materials all figure into Allston plans, according to Krieger.
Harvard’s Allston Science and Engineering Complex, set to fully open this fall, boasts a greenspace landscaped to mitigate the effects of a “100-year flood” — a term for a severe flooding event that has a one in 100 chance of occurring in a given year. The building’s foundation encloses two cisterns designed to collect and disperse stormwater, according to School of Engineering and Applied Sciences spokesperson Paul Karoff.
The project notification form for Harvard’s planned Enterprise Research Campus, another Allston outcrop, notes that the area is not within a FEMA-designated floodplain. Still, developers will “go above-and-beyond current resiliency standards” and will be able to manage a “32-year flood,” according to the document.
Krieger said he believes there is not much developers can do to protect existing structures along the Charles, like the River Houses, athletic fields, and the Business School.
But Krieger, a self-described optimist, said he believes humanity will resolve the climate crisis before it creates a sea level rise scenario that would greatly threaten Harvard’s campus.
“It’s tough to actually imagine a solution as the situation worsens and worsens as opposed to intermediate solutions with the hope that ultimately we will be able to, if not reverse, at least slow down things such as sea level rise or climate change,” he said.
Krieger said he thinks “the most immediate issues” for infrastructure along the Charles River is the flooding that will result from increased storms, rather than sea level rise. He added that a building’s short-term ability to capture and disperse water is what counts.
Krieger said raising the ground level can also safeguard Allston developments “for a conceivably long time,” but went on to say it is difficult to plan for the next century based on current projections.
By contrast, Princeton geosciences professor Michael Oppenheimer said he thinks Harvard can — and should — plan for the next century.
“The idea that you can only plan so far ahead, I think, is wrong,” he said. “Not thinking about what’s going to happen beyond essentially 2050 is ludicrous because you have to.”
Sea level rise and flooding projections for the next three decades are relatively certain, according to Oppenheimer, a former Cambridge resident and a lead author on the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
“Beyond that things get a little slippery,” he said.
If Harvard intends to construct riverside buildings that will last as long as the centuries-old Harvard Yard has, he said the University needs to brave the uncertainty and commit to planning for the full 21st century.
“My guess is they’re trying to do the cheap and easy thing, which is plan for 2050, build for 2050, and hope the worst case doesn’t happen beyond that,” Oppenheimer said. “It’s up to them whether they want to pass off the costs of not making a cautious decision to future generations.”
Oppenheimer said that “simple measures” — like raising the ground level and equipping buildings with water dispersal capabilities — are likely enough to keep campus resilient through the mid-century. But beyond that, he said, sea walls, surge barriers, and anything “permanent concrete and steel” may be required for the several feet of sea level rise Boston may see this century.
Krieger floated examples of more drastic solutions to the rise: raising buildings on stilts, leveeing Memorial Drive, or ultimately relocating buildings.
Moving buildings away from high-risk areas is not inconceivable, he added. Buildings were relocated as Harvard’s campus grew to overtake parts of Cambridge and as the MBTA subway’s Red Line expanded.
“There are limits,” he noted, referring to relocation. “Whether or not you could lift Widener, right?”
As for what Harvard’s campus will look like in 2070, Krieger was blunt.
“God only knows,” he said.
Tufts University urban planning professor Justin B. Hollander said that while Bostonians talk more about sea level rise “than the average city,” Boston is largely “failing” to incorporate that thinking into urban planning.
As an example, Hollander cited the Seaport District — a flashy waterfront development that cost $18 billion in public funds, yet will be very soon subject to costly flooding, according to projections.
“If you look at the Seaport district, which is at sea level, as is most of the Harvard campus, you really just have to wonder...the disconnect between the planning function and the way that development happens in the city,” Hollander said.
Hollander said very few Greater Boston localities — Cambridge included — have taken action to force developers to combat sea level rise, adding that the “cost is just so enormous” for both cities and universities like Harvard.
Cambridge-based architect Franziska R. Amacher said she believes “thinking about moving inland” is the “only long-term alternative,” though she acknowledges the enormous challenges such plans would impose on “existing communities.”
Krieger said a more radical approach to protecting Boston would be connecting the islands and estuaries that dot Boston Harbor into a causeway.
Architect Peter P. Papesch ’60, co-chair of the Sustainability Education Commission at the Boston Society for Architecture, suggested going further out to sea. He alternatively proposed a $50 to $80 billion “Metro Boston dike barrier” megaproject that would encircle Boston beginning from Lynn, Mass. and ending down in Hingham, Mass. from eight miles out into the Atlantic.
Papesch said either the city will have to stomach a “huge expenditure” to protect Greater Boston — or otherwise retreat from the area.
Papesch warned that few are willing to talk about this issue. Architects are worried about losing their contracts should they raise sea level rise concerns, and city officials do not want to raise alarm among real estate developers that back them, according to him.
“Just like the architects with their clients, [city officials] are not really ready to jeopardize their finances by saying: ‘Hey guys, you are in deep shit,’” Papesch said.
Among those to break the silence on this issue is a frontrunner in Boston’s mayoral race, Michelle Wu ’07, who has focused much of her 2021 campaign on climate change. She has specifically called attention to the rising sea level in New England, which she calls an “issue of public sector responsibility.”
“It doesn’t help when we have shiny new commercial buildings that just end up pushing the water to residential areas that can’t afford these adaptations on their own, or to infrastructure like our streets and MBTA stations,” she said. “This is really about a city-wide and regional conversation, and how we can move to match the urgency and scale of what we’re seeing.”
Brownsberger said local governments have collaborated with Harvard to solve various local environmental issues. He said he initially thought municipalities would have longer environmental planning timelines than a university like Harvard, but found that the opposite was the case.
“Harvard as an institution tends to have the longest planning horizon of anybody,” Brownsberger said.
Wu, likewise, called Harvard an “anchor institution” and “major partner” to the City of Boston, including collaborations on environmental issues.
Adding to the symbiosis, Harvard is reliant on municipalities for guidance in severe flooding situations.
A 2014 Boston Green Ribbon Commission report on university disaster response, which included interviews with Harvard spokespeople, concluded that Harvard is especially dependent on “external systems,” like utilities and government agencies for disaster response in a Charles River extreme flooding scenario.
For Justin L. Brown, a climate justice activist with the Allston-Brighton Node of 350 Massachusetts for a Better Future, one of the most frightening aspects of rising sea levels is that the flooding and damage residents are currently experiencing is merely “the result of emissions of historic emissions” and not present fossil fuel consumption.
Though he acknowledged there is still time to “head off the worst of the climate crisis,” he noted the delay between fossil fuel emission and sea level rise makes mitigation more challenging.
“Even if we were to somehow magically stop all fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions right now, we would still see an increase in the effects moving forward,” he said.
The reality, per Brown, is that certain neighborhoods of Boston along the coastline and along the Charles River will inevitably become “uninhabitable” as sea levels continue to rise.
As a result, Brown said the “smart thing to do” in the short-term is to conduct “managed retreats” from areas that are liable to severe flooding according to scientific projections. Such areas would then return to their natural state, since natural barriers, he added, are “so much better equipped at lessening and mitigating the effects of rising seas.”
Deputy director of the Charles River Watershed Association Julie D. Wood said the CRWA also favors “nature-based solutions” to rising sea levels.
“These are basically engineered systems that use natural processes,” she added. “So in the case of coastal flooding that might mean reestablishing coastal wetlands where they were historically.”
Green Cambridge director Steven Nutter also said policy makers ought to view areas and buildings liable to flooding from a “systems perspective,” recognizing that sites vulnerable to flooding are part of “living systems” and that individual landowners cannot be solely responsible for mitigation.
Nutter said, in addition, that decision makers should look beyond just property damage and acknowledge the substantial “human” cost of regional flooding.
“From a human perspective, it’s definitely going to be those who we already know are most vulnerable — both financially vulnerable because of the systems of our society but also, potentially, health vulnerable because the increased moisture could also increase mold in buildings, which decreases indoor air quality and causes respiratory problems,” Nutter added.
Undergirding policy changes on any level of government, according to Brown, must be a commitment to environmental justice, which he said involves identifying and remedying “past injustices.”
“Those that feel the effects first and worst of the climate crisis are those with the fewest number of resources,” Brown said. “It tends to affect mostly low-income communities, Black communities, brown communities — communities that have historically been burdened with all kinds of other injustices including housing injustice, economic injustice, racial injustice.”
Brown said he and other activists hope to empower individuals to challenge the “entrenched and powerful interests” that are responsible for the climate crisis.
Harvard has taken a proactive step towards mitigating damage from future floods, recently offering to front the $50 million cost of an expanded water and sewer storm drain that will service around 100 acres of mainly residential neighborhoods.
“More than 1,500 households in North Allston will directly benefit from this substantial upgrade to the City’s infrastructure,” Harvard spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke said. “In the event of a significant storm, this new project will protect thousands of residents and property owners from flooding and property damage.”
As an alternative or as a supplement to such infrastructure, per CRWA director Wood, Harvard can use its “unique” influence in the Boston area to play a role in regional flooding mitigation by dedicating developed land to restore original tidelands.
Hollander said he believes Harvard should also consider propping up buildings — especially the River Houses — on stilts, though Krieger cautioned that this approach could create accessibility issues.
But some experts pointed out the University could simply get ahead of rising sea waters by taking swift and decisive action on climate change.
William E. “Bill” McKibben ’82 — environmentalist and former president of The Crimson, who has been vocal in his support of the Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard movement — said he believes the University’s best protection is large-scale divestment from fossil fuels in an attempt to “bring climate change under control” rather than through adaptation.
“[Divestment is] going to be a lot easier than trying to figure out how to maneuver on a wrecked planet, which is what we’re headed towards,” he said. “Individual institutions with as much power as Harvard have a huge role to play in trying to keep the temperature from going up more than it has to.”
Wu, who previously served as the president of Boston City Council, noted that the city has in the past had to push Harvard “to match community needs” regarding environmental concerns.
In a Feb. 2021 Boston Globe op-ed, Harvard Management Company’s Kathryn I. “Kate” Murtagh wrote that “well intentioned” calls for divestment “fail to address the demand side of the equation.”
“Harvard could, theoretically, commit to not owning shares of fossil fuel companies (we don’t currently own any), but that would not reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the real economy,” she wrote.
In a 2020 statement, University President Lawrence S. Bacow announced Harvard’s endowment would be greenhouse gas neutral by 2050, though some students and activists like McKibben have still slammed the move as insufficient.
“By the time Allston goes underwater, the world is going to be a deeply chaotic place,” McKibben said. “Allston is a good symbol that there’s no escaping climate change.”

On May 11, during an otherwise ordinary meeting of the Finance Committee to discuss the 2022 Cambridge budget, a dispute erupted between City Manager Louis A. DePasquale and Councilor Jivan G. Sobrinho-Wheeler, highlighting a common fault of conflict in Cambridge government.
Sobrinho-Wheeler suggested that, for the 2023 budget, the city conduct “transparent” and “more engaging” hearings with a longer timeline. He cited Boston’s public working sessions, which allow the budget to change “according to the wills of the elected body.”
“I have to respond to that,” DePasquale interjected.
“This is a city manager form of government, and as much as the council sometimes feels it isn’t, it is,” DePasquale said. “You either work with the city manager’s position, or you remove it and go to a different function, but you can’t change the government that you have.”
“This is the government of Cambridge, this is the process that we have. It is something I am proud of,” DePasquale continued, pounding his desk. “[Residents are] proud of it and I think the councilor should be proud of it.”
The City of Cambridge operates on a “council-manager” form of municipal government, also known as Plan E — as DePasquale alluded to — in which executive power is invested in a city manager appointed by a city council which performs legislative and oversight functions.
“I do appreciate the city manager’s comments — I’ve gotta say, I don’t appreciate the tone as much,” Sobrinho-Wheeler said. “The city council, the charter is very clear, has to approve the budget.”
Ultimately, Sobrinho-Wheeler voted present on the budget overview alongside Councilor Quinton Y. Zondervan, while the other seven councilors all voted in favor.
Disputes like this are common between the city manager and the city council, as the balance of power has shifted toward the former in recent decades.
In the past few years, city councilors and DePasquale have sparred over everything from police oversight to budgets to the Covid-19 reopening.
Itamar Turner-Trauring, a Cambridge resident and bicycle safety reform advocate, cited a current dispute over municipal broadband as a clear example where the public does not have sufficient influence.
“Every single city council member, the public as a whole either supports it or they’re neutral,” Turner-Trauring said. “Getting an actual expert estimate of how much it costs should not be a big ask given that, and other cities have done it, but because this one person says no, it has stalled for years.”
Municipal broadband has been a long-simmering issue in Cambridge, with the original “Broadband Task Force” appointed by the previous city manager, Richard C. Rossi, in 2014. Recently, city councilors have threatened to vote down the city’s budget over repeated delays on a municipal broadband study.
“I just want the council to understand that if I can’t work this out, that they will be telling city employees that because of the broadband not being able to work out, they will be losing their jobs,” DePasquale said during the same May 11 meeting.
DePasquale went on to describe the council’s actions as “holding the budget hostage.”
According to Zondervan, the dispute over municipal broadband has taken six years to play out. He added, however, that aside from municipal broadband, most members of the council have not been “actively disagreeing” with the city manager.
One of the highest-profile disputes between the council and DePasquale has been regarding his September 2020 contract extension.
“The process itself was a sham,” Zondervan said.
“They had lined up all these people in public comment to say nice things about [DePasquale],” he added. “I totally agree — but this has nothing to do with whether or not he should be our city manager.”
By the time the council reached the September deadline, Zondervan said it “had yet to see an actual contract.”
“We’re told that we have to vote on this tonight, because that’s the deadline,” Zondervan said. “So if we don’t vote on a contract, [DePasquale] might walk.”
The council ultimately decided to approve a year-and-a-half long contract expiring in July 2022 — eight months after the new city council is elected.
“The problem with that is, and why a year-and-a-half extension didn’t make any sense to me, is that we’re now in an election year,” Zondervan said. “Even if this council somehow magically agreed on what we want the next city manager to do, we could have a very different council elected in November.”
DePasquale’s office did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
DePasquale’s remarks at the May 11 meeting reflects the power dynamic in Cambridge’s system of government. Namely, that the city manager holds most of it.
Zondervan, who previously sparred with DePasquale over Covid-19 reopening and the budget, said the council has “almost none of the power.”
“Our form of government, which is called Plan E for the City of Cambridge, delineates the power so that the council hires the city manager, but then the city manager has full autonomy to run the city,” Zondervan said.
“We can say, ‘Dear City Manager, will you please fix the pothole over there?’ but we can’t require the city manager to do anything,” he added.
The current situation sits in stark contrast to the spirit of the charter, according to David E. Sullivan, a former city councilor.
“The theory of the charter is the city council is supreme. The city manager works for the city council, gets hired and fired by the city council at its discretion, and the city council is supposed to set policy,” Sullivan said. “His only job is to carry out the policies of the city council.”
“In practice, what has happened is the city manager has a lot of the same powers that a strong mayor would have, but none of the accountability of a strong mayor who has to run for reelection,” Sullivan added.
The Plan E form of government, established by the state of Massachusetts in 1938, provides for the proportional election of seven to nine councilors, who then elect a ceremonial mayor from among themselves. The council then appoints the city manager, who controls the city’s executive functions, while the council carries out legislative functions.
This is in contrast to the “strong mayor” system referenced by Sullivan, in which the mayor is directly elected by the people rather than the council. In this form of governance, used by cities such as Somerville, Mass., the mayor has control over the city’s executive functions, rather than a city manager.
According to the book “Building Old Cambridge: Architecture and Development” by Susan E. Maycock and Charles M. Sullivan, Plan E was adopted in Cambridge in response to the “ostentatiously inefficient and corrupt” government of Mayor John W. Lyons, culminating in a 17 percent tax increase in 1940 and the subsequent majority vote in favor of Plan E. Following the first Council election in 1941, Lyons was indicted on charges of soliciting bribes.
“People were using political positions to benefit themselves, so they adopted this Plan E form of government to separate them,” Zondervan said. “The city manager was frequently fired — it was not uncommon for a new council to be elected, and then to immediately fire this new manager.”
“That limits the level of entrenched power that the city manager can accumulate because they’re just not around long enough,” Zondervan added.
According to Zondervan, this changed with City Manager Robert W. Healy. Appointed in 1981, Healy served for more than thirty years before retiring in 2013, making him the longest-tenured city manager in city history.
“He became king,” Councilor Dennis J. Carlone said. “I was a consultant watching this: half the council disliked him, thought he was imperious, acted like a king, but they never fired him because he did a good job.”
“The charter says the council decides all policy,” Carlone added. “He just did what he wanted, and most of the council agreed.”
Even after Healy’s departure, his influence on city governance continued. His successor, Rossi, also served as Healy’s deputy city manager for 32 years. DePasquale was also a long-term member of the Healy administration, serving as the city’s budget director for 20 years.
“I think that all of that history creates a real power imbalance,” Zondervan said. “In theory, we could fire the city manager, but we haven’t done that in 40 years.”
Sullivan said that one disincentive to firing the city manager is the buyout clause that exists on their contract. This buyout clause necessitates that the city pay the city manager his or her entire salary and benefits for the duration of the contract when fired, which according to Sullivan, creates a “strong anti-accountability provision.”
He added that another prevalent problem with the council-manager form of government is that the city council’s reliance on the city manager to enforce policy creates a “dynamic in which the council doesn’t dare cross the city manager.”
“If a member of the city council crosses the city manager, meaning does something he doesn’t like, the business that they want him to take care of for them isn’t going to get done,” Sullivan said.
Carlone spoke to the same problem, comparing the situation to a teacher-student relationship.
“If you bad-mouth the teacher, even if you’re an A-quality student, somehow it comes back at you,” Carlone said. “That’s what’s happening to some degree, and it’s a shame.”
Sullivan noted, however, a benefit of having a hired city manager is that, in theory, they are a “professional” rather than a “politician.”
“The goal is to have somebody whose sole focus is on making the city run right, and not be worried about the politics,” Sullivan said.
Carlone added he would rather have a chief executive who has the suitable qualifications and expertise and be able to “pick the right person” instead of “getting the wrong mayor for two years.” He also said that he fears a strong mayor system because of the limited role that the council would have under that form of government.
“I fear it because it actually reduces what the council does,” Carlone said.
Cambridge is one of only two cities in the Commonwealth that has a Plan E form of government. In fact, the state legislature has since made it illegal for any other city to adopt the Plan E form of government, per Zondervan. He said the “outdated” nature of the city charter has prompted a formal review of it that may eventually turn into charter reform.
“It’s literally been 80 years, and nobody’s ever even reviewed it, let alone reformed it,” Zondervan said. “We haven’t even asked the question, ‘Is this really how we want to be governed?’”
According to Zondervan, Councilor Patricia M. “Patty” Nolan ’80 initiated a charter review process which is currently ongoing.
Zondervan also said the city has come to the point where voters are “fed up with it” and want to “move in a different direction.” In particular, he believes they want to have the ability to directly elect the mayor, rather than have the mayor be elected by the council.
A charter project team from the Collins Center for Public Management was hired to examine Cambridge’s current charter and its options for potential change. They found that there is a “wide variety of opinions” among council members on the question of whether to replace the city manager as chief executive with a directly elected mayor, according to a memorandum sent to the council dated April 28.
“On balance, it does not appear that there is a majority on the council to consider a wholesale change in form of government to a mayor at this point in time, let alone the kind of super-majority that would make a change more likely to succeed,” the memorandum reads.
“Put simply, it does not seem like a full debate on converting to a strong mayor form of government is something the council may want to undertake at this time,” the memorandum adds.
The memorandum notes that many councilors are concerned about the “potential damage” that a “simultaneous discussion” about eliminating the city manager position might have on the recruitment of the new city manager, which will culminate in the replacement of DePasquale once his most recent contract expires in July 2022.
Carlone said whomever the city manager is the council still has the responsibility to work together with them to govern.
“I’ll say one thing about all three of the last [city managers], including [DePasquale]: very dedicated, they love Cambridge, they all grew up here. They love Cambridge, to their credit, but it’s a changing world,” Carlone said. “I feel we were elected to work together, and if we don’t, then we’re not living up to what our responsibilities are.”

Jose Marco C. “Marcky” Antonio was waiting with his twin brother in the attic on Dec. 17, the day Harvard released early admissions decisions for the Class of 2025, when they noticed an update to their admissions portal.
“We were waiting for an email because we thought Harvard would email us our acceptance decisions, but we decided to just say ‘screw it’ and just go straight to the admissions website,” Antonio said. “And that’s when we saw the status update.”
Antonio recalled his parents preparing to pop a bottle of champagne before the decisions were released, but he called the acceptances he and his brother received “really unexpected.”
“I was elated to say the least,” Antonio said. “Considering how many people got in this year, I think admissions can be totally unpredictable. So while we say we prepare this much to try to get in as much as possible, it was really unexpected for us.”
Antonio and his brother, both seniors at Boston Latin School, were two of the 1,968 students admitted to the Class of 2025. Their admissions cycle saw a 3.43 percent acceptance rate amid a record-high 57,435 applicants, marking the lowest admissions rate and the most diverse class in the College’s history.
“We have the most diverse class in the history of Harvard this year, economically and ethnically,” Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said in a previous interview with The Crimson. “This is an incoming group of students who’ve had experiences unlike any experiences first-year students have had in the history of Harvard or history of higher education.”
With 18 million views and 5 million likes on one video, Abigail V. Mack – a Class of 2025 admit from Cardinal Spellman High School in Brockton, Mass. – “didn’t really know what to do” after her post sharing the introduction to her Common App essay went viral on TikTok.
Mack said she wrote about the loss of her mother and the significance of the letter “s” in the word “parents.” In her viral video, she said, “I used to have two parents, but now I have one, and the ‘s’ in parents isn't going anywhere.”
“When my mom passed away, I was 12 and my life felt really uncontrollable. So I tried to control what I could, and the easiest way to do that had been academically,” Mack said. “I just studied a lot because I could control my grades if I worked really hard doing all my assignments. And it became easier to feel like I had this, this focus and this drive to keep going. And it helped me to not focus on the loss so much.”
“There’s a stigma around college applications that have to do with personal tragedy and that it can come across as looking for a pity acceptance,” she added. “So I wanted to make sure that I was acknowledging that my situation wasn't unique, but I wanted to still try and stay true to my individual story.”
Mack applied to Harvard College during the regular decision cycle, but she said received a likely letter prior to opening her decision. She now has a following of over 120,000 on TikTok.
The story Antonio presented in his application was also deeply personal. He said his experience of living with hemophilia influenced his college application as well as his plans for his time on campus.
“It’s a hereditary bleeding disorder that affects my body’s ability to clot blood normally, and so I wrote about my experience living with that in the Philippines and overcoming it,” Antonio said. “I think one hundred percent it definitely motivated us to apply, it definitely made the difference in terms of our application, and in really putting in the human aspect into our essay.”
Antonio, who was born in the Philippines and lived there as a child, said his experience living in the Philippines motivated him and his brother to apply to Harvard.
“Being there, I saw the disparity in access to education, and even healthcare. Although treatments were available, it was so expensive in the Philippines compared to here without health insurance,” he said. “And so living those lives really changed our perspectives, and our outlooks on things and in life in general. It really motivated us to make the most out of our circumstances once we immigrated here.”
Some students discovered how their strengths and personal narrative fit into Harvard even before their senior year of high school.
Priyanka Kaul, a student at West Windsor-Plainsboro South High School in Princeton Junction, N.J., who will join Harvard’s softball team in the fall, said she started getting recruited by Harvard during her junior year.
After attending a softball camp at Harvard in the fall of her junior year, Kaul said she received a call from the head coach offering her a spot on the softball team – an experience she described as “super surreal.”
“For me, that was like the ‘opening the decision’ moment. That kind of happened on the phone for me,” Kaul said. “When they offered me, I wasn’t really expecting it because it was more of a gradual process.”
Members of the Class of 2025 spent their entire high school senior year embroiled in a pandemic, which radically disrupted their extracurriculars, standardized test taking, and mental health, in addition to day-to-day classes.
Pema Choedon – a Tibetan international admit from the Asian School in India – said Covid-19 compounded the usual challenges of the college application process by limiting access to testing.
“A lot of SAT tests were cancelled. I was able to take the test, but many of my friends weren’t able to because their tests got pulled,” she said. “My whole state has one center. Everyone from my state has to come to my city to take the test.”
Covid testing delays precluded Antonio from sitting down for the SAT before his Harvard application was due. Ultimately, however, he was able to take advantage of Harvard test-optional pandemic policy, which allowed students to apply without submitting standardized test scores.
For some students, Covid disrupted extracurriculars in addition to testing. Kaul said the pandemic affected how much she was able to play softball over the past year.
“I went from going to practice like three times a week and playing every single weekend to suddenly, none of that was happening,” Kaul said. “My grandma also visits me, and so I was even more cautious than normal, obviously, because she’s high risk.”
“My team started traveling last fall – in the fall of 2020 – they were getting on a plane every weekend going to Texas, Florida, Las Vegas,” Kaul added. “They were traveling the country basically playing softball, and I just couldn’t do any of that because I was with my grandma. I would say I can’t remember a time in my life where I've taken that much time off before.”
For those who deferred to the Class of 2025, the pandemic has led to new opportunities. Harry Cotter, who was admitted to the Class of 2024 and hails from Ridley Park, Pa., said he chose to take a gap year due to Harvard's decision to hold classes on Zoom this past academic year.
“Like everybody else, I ended high school on Zoom, and I could not imagine that being my freshman year,” Cotter said. “I realized that I didn’t really care about waiting a year if it meant that I had a better opportunity to be in person, which was really my ultimate goal.”
Cotter said his choice to defer and pursue other opportunities during his gap year – including supervising Covid testing sites at the University of Pennsylvania – “worked out for the best.”
“I started working for a construction company that installed commercial kitchen equipment,” he said. “I’m a mechanical engineering major, so this was like a cool little practical perspective that I was able to get that was really awesome.”
Antonio, who plans to pursue studies in science and medicine while at Harvard, said the experience of living with hemophilia in the Philippines has heavily influenced his aspirations — as well as those of his twin brother.
“That motivation to give back on account of our privilege also motivated us to apply because we know Harvard’s mission is to educate students to be citizens and citizen leaders,” he said.
Kaul, who is excited to assume her place on the softball team, said she has been able to connect with other members of the Class of 2025 through social media.
“I can see already some small communities forming within – obviously, my softball team and I – but also just the whole class in general,” Kaul said. “I’ve gotten to know so many people through Instagram and our GroupMe and our Zoom calls.”
Mack said she looks forward to meeting the rest of the Class of 2025 in the fall — especially given their diverse backgrounds.
“It’s funny, I actually wrote about that in my Harvard specific supplement and why I want to go to Harvard is because I want to be exposed to all these different people with these different backgrounds and different passions and Harvard is the epicenter of that,” Mack said. “I think that since this is their most diverse year ever, Harvard is really embodying that.”

When Harvard Business School professor Janice H. Hammond was first hired, she was questioned for parking in the faculty lot and using the faculty Xerox machine.
“I’ve been there a long time and things are a lot better, but you know what? Early on, I was questioned by just about everybody because there simply were almost no women,” she said in an interview.
Hammond, who is now senior associate dean for culture and community, has been at the Business School for almost 37 years. The year Hammond began her tenure, 1984, saw the first woman to run for the vice presidency of the United States in a major party ticket, the first American woman to walk in space, and American female athletes bringing home a total of 62 Olympic medals.
Throughout her tenure at Harvard, Hammond’s actions have carved a space for women to succeed at the historically male Business School, which exists in the shadow of the male-dominated finance field.
During a 2009 faculty meeting in which professors voted on that year’s Baker Scholars — students whose grades put them in the top 5 percent of their class and who graduate with “high distinction” — Hammond asked a question that stumped the other faculty members in the room.
“I literally just was glancing at one of the women that was a Baker Scholar that year,” she said. “And I said, ‘Well, could you just tell us how many of the Baker Scholars were women?’”
“That’s when the answer came out that ‘we don’t know,’” she recalled. “I think that was perhaps as impactful as the number.”
After a break in the middle of the meeting, Hammond said, someone counted the male and female Baker Scholars. There were six women, and 39 men.
The qualifications for Baker Scholars are strict. Students must achieve first-year and second-year honors to graduate “with distinction.” After that, only the top five percent of the graduating class can qualify for Baker Scholar status, after a committee of faculty members conclude that each qualifying student followed the HBS “community values” during their time at the school.
Per a 2013 article in The Atlantic, 2009 had a particularly large discrepancy between women chosen to be Baker Scholars compared to the overall graduating class composition. Since then, the number of female Baker Scholars has risen and the gap in between men and women’s performance has narrowed.
According to Hammond, the origin of the gender grade gap is not clear, but she noted that women sometimes fall out of the running to be Baker Scholars after they do not qualify for first-year honors.
“The reality is we don’t know what brought the gap down in the last decade or so,” Hammond said. “These differences for distinction for first-year honors and second-year honors, they’ve always been within 10 percentage points of women’s representation in the class, and before that it was higher.”
Hammond said, however, administrators and professors at the school have made it a priority to make sure all students feel they are able to succeed.
“We worked a lot to think about how to make sure that everybody in the community feels that they can meet their potential from the beginning,” Hammond said.
Despite this, women remain underrepresented in the Baker Scholar group.
Using available data from the University alumni directory, The Crimson determined that from 2015 to 2021, men were disproportionately represented in the Baker Scholars’ cohort compared to the overall HBS gender ratio. The Crimson was not able to obtain other data on the scholars to control for any factors that may mitigate the discrepancy in the makeup of the Baker Scholars.
HBS spokesperson Brian C. Kenny wrote in an email that they are not aware such data exists.
“We are not aware of any additional factors accounting for the gender gap,” Kenny wrote.
Some students, however, point to a discrepancy in educational and work experience backgrounds that may allow some to fare better than others at HBS.
Second-year MBA student Megan A. Murday, who came to HBS with a liberal arts instead of finance background, said that students with finance backgrounds are often seen as a “source of authority and authoritative opinion,” regardless of gender, according to Murday.
A 2018 Catalyst study found that women make up less than 17 percent of senior leadership in investment banking.
HBS professor Robin J. Ely, the founder and faculty chair of the Gender Initiative — the school’s program to advance equity in the business world — said in an interview that a 2012 study conducted under the school’s Culture and Community Initiative found that controlling for finance background, undergraduate grade point average, and test scores in years prior to 2012 did not narrow the gender grade gap. She added, though, women generally come from finance backgrounds less often.
“I think that was probably one of the most important aspects of that whole undertaking is that people just couldn’t walk around and say the women were less good,” Ely said.
Kenny wrote in an email that studies such as the 2012 Culture and Community Initiative Ely cited were not released to the public nor to the HBS student body.
“The results are not shared with members of the community out of concern that they could introduce bias into the educational process,” he wrote. “Given the small number of Baker Scholars in a given year, any bias introduced into the educational process could have an oversized impact on the outcome.”
This year, the 2021 Baker Scholars consist of 17 women and 23 men. This ratio of 42.5 percent and 57.5 percent, respectively, represents a higher proportion of women than the 42 percent found in the graduating class of 2021.
Murday said that she felt “really proud” of this year’s breakdown and deeply admired other women who were “vocal and strong in a classroom setting.”
“I am excited that our class was able to achieve a more equitable distribution of Baker Scholars because that reflects the performance I saw in the classroom as well,” Murday added.
Kenny did not directly respond to a question on what specifically may have contributed to the closing of the gender gap in Baker Scholars this year.
“We continually analyze and experiment with new approaches and we believe that collectively those actions are having the desired impact,” Kenny wrote.
The Crimson could only find two years for which the award recipients’ names were published on HBS’s Commencement website — 2020 and 2021. When asked for a year-by-year breakdown of Baker Scholars by gender and race, Kenny said this information is not publicly disclosed.
Murday described a lack of “transparency” around how Baker Scholars are chosen, and several other students said the same.
A survey by several gender equity student organizations at HBS published in The Harbus — the Business School’s student newspaper — this month found a large percentage of the student body also felt the criteria around choosing Baker Scholars was opaque.
“[O]nly 41% of women and 51% of men said they were clear on what it would take to become a Baker Scholar,” the report read.
2021 Baker Scholar Ayush Bhargava said he favored releasing details on the makeup of the Baker Scholar cohort, arguing that more transparency could help measure gender and race parity.
“If HBS releases the statistics, it might become much easier for people to study the disparity between the class composition and the Baker Scholar composition,” Bhargava said.
The report in the Harbus dispelling first-year myths, which included the study on student familiarity with Baker Scholar criteria, reported that students generally felt they were treated equitably in the classroom by faculty members during their required credit, or RC, year.
Students, however, reported a disparty in how they were treated by fellow students, an issue which “appears to be driven” by white males. Less than three percent of white males reported feeling treated inequitably by classmates, whereas 12 percent of men of color and women of all races and ethnicities reported feeling inequitably treated.
The study also revealed that only six out of 10 students felt their perspectives were welcomed in the classroom setting.
Following Nitin Nohria’s appointment as dean of the Business School in July 2010, faculty raised the issue of gender inequality that was first widely acknowledged during the 2009 faculty meeting around Baker Scholars.
“For many of us, this was just something we were aware of, but it had never been actually publicly discussed until it came up at that meeting, and so I count that as the kind of initial consciousness raising on the faculty,” Ely said.
As a result, one of Nohria’s five priorities for his tenure — announced in the fall of 2010 — was “inclusion.”
The “inclusion” priority was the only one on Nohria’s agenda that did not fall naturally into the domain of a senior associate dean. Nohria asked Ely, whose research focused on gender and race relations in organizations, to head up a Culture and Community Initiative.
Ely said she was “thrilled” to head the initiative. She recalled Nohria telling her that it was “very high priority” for him and that he wanted to “shine a light on it.”
Ely added that it was unclear what was driving the grade gap before 2010, and that this was “concerning.” She considered two possible explanations during the Initiative: levels of preparedness coming into the school, and the demands on students during their time at HBS.
Ely launched an empirical investigation of the pre-2012 grade gap, aggregating data including first-year grades, overall satisfaction, survey data, GMATs, financial background, undergraduate GPA, and more.
The study — confidential but shared among HBS faculty — determined that the grade gap was a “demand issue,” produced by the culture of the school. Controlling for those factors, the grade gap “remained significant,” according to Ely.
The study, however, also observed the grade gap closing to non-significance before 2010, regardless of the potential confounding factors.
Since the 2012 Culture and Community Initiative, Ely said there has not been another report.
Brooke D. Boyarsky Pratt, a 2013 Baker Scholar, recalled meeting with administration regularly as a section Educational Representative — a kind of liaison between students and administration. She said one of her jobs as a representative for the Student Association was to make it a priority for all students to feel included in the classroom.
“We had active conversations with the administrators about making sure that the class was a very inclusive environment where people felt like they could bring their whole selves and participate,” Boyarsky Pratt said.
She also noticed the material in the curriculum had changed, noting that cases in class centered more around “diversity” than they had in past years.
Ely said HBS is particularly mindful of students’ educational experience at the school.
“I’ve never been at an institution that is so conscientious about ensuring a high-quality experience for the students, especially in the classroom because that’s what we have the most control over,” Ely said.
Boyarsky Pratt said that although she felt HBS had a “male-oriented culture,” she had a mixed-gender friend group she could confide in.
“The net net was like, does it feel like a more male oriented culture? Totally,” Boyarsky Pratt said. “Did that, you know, negatively affect my experience? I didn’t feel like it did. I felt like people were really inclusive.”
Though many students said they feel the culture is inclusive, others believe that gender inequity still exists in the school’s culture.
Second-year MBA student Dana M. Louie said when she first got to HBS, she felt the space “was more welcoming to male-identifying students.”
“There were just, sort of rules and cultural norms that were more stereotypically male,” Louie said. “We’re graded on participation and we’re in these really large classrooms where if you have a quieter voice, you might not have as good participation.”
Louie added that the biggest “structural” norm that was “stereotypically male” is how using the restroom during class is considered inappropriate.
“I think as a female, I more often need to use the restroom. I mean, for God’s sake, I menstruate,” Louie added.
As her section’s Gender Equity representative, Murday said she noticed female students “tend to take up much less airtime for comments” than male students, but that it was not an aspect of the classroom that others were “enforcing” upon female students. Ultimately, Murday said she “personally never felt undervalued.”
In her Negotiations class, Louie said she felt students were better off if they had “stereotypically male traits,” which she described as argument and negotiation, as opposed to more “female traits” of collaboration and collective agreement. She wondered if HBS should also reward negotiators who, instead of being “aggressive,” are “very good at being collaborative and helping amplify other people’s voices.”
Louie said, however, some professors intentionally brought gender equity to the “forefront” of discussion.
“I think there’s definitely the push for gender equity, it feels very prevalent at the school,” Louie said. “But at the same time, you know, it’s clearly not completely equal.”
Though no publicly available reports have emerged on the grade gap, the Business School has implemented several tools and initiatives to mitigate potential bias in the classroom.
One such undertaking is the Gender Initiative, which Ely founded in 2015 to “close disparities of opportunities as well as outcomes,” calling inequality a waste of talent. According to Colleen C. Ammerman, director of the Gender Initiative, the team exists for research purposes.
“It’s important for us to think of working toward gender and racial and other forms of equity at the school institutionally as an ongoing mission,” she said. “It’s not something that you just get — for instance with Baker Scholars, kind of get to one year where you see gender parity and say ‘okay, now we can move on.’”
Another initiative is the HBS Action Plan for Racial Equity, announced in 2020. Despite this, students still said the school could do better in supporting international students and students of color.
Second-year MBA student and Baker Scholar Mae Abdelrahman said she was “very sad and disappointed” to see there were fewer Black students selected as Baker Scholars this year compared to last.
“While we’re moving towards gender parity, I hope that we will also move in a direction of equity for all other underrepresented groups,” Abdelrahman added.
In 2011, HBS held an orientation week for the Class of 2013. Boyarsky Pratt recalled a workshop in which students were taught “best practices” for their time at HBS, such as “aggressive” hand-raising, teaching students how to read cases, and explaining available student resources, such as free tutoring. Boyarsky Pratt said she did not remember the workshop being “outwardly gendered.”
“If you want to get called on, you just have to raise your hand quickly and aggressively because of the 90 people in your section, I don’t know, 70, 60 might raise their hand with a thought,” Boyarsky Pratt said. “So I didn’t feel like that was condescending or anything. I actually thought it was super helpful.”
Anoothi, a second-year MBA student and Baker Scholar who does not use a last name, said she initially faced “confidence issues” because she is from India and was not familiar with the U.S. education system.
“Speaking in the class was not as easy for me as, I would say, a lot of white males,” she said.
Second-year MBA student and Baker Scholar Eufern Pan said the school could do better in supporting international students. She said her experience working at McKinsey & Company helped her speak up in the classroom, but the HBS experience is “very foreign” for many other international students and “in many ways very contradictory to Asian culture.”
She argued HBS education should challenge the belief that “putting yourself out there” is necessary for success as a leader, especially for students who work in non-Western countries after graduation. Pan also said that HBS should push for “psychological safety” when it comes to bringing up differing opinions in the classroom.
A tool professors mentioned helped them keep track of patterns in who they called on is a scribe program — staff who keep track of speakers and comments in the classroom — which was implemented officially in 2012. Hammond, the senior associate dean for culture and community, said that while she thinks the program has been “terrific” and may have helped with gender parity, there is no concrete statistical evidence that scribes have made a direct difference in the gender gap.
Louie said she appreciated knowing that regardless of vocal delivery, comments could be attributed to the right people, and this was “great” for gender equity in the classroom. She said, however, having scribes could be “a little intimidating,” especially in her first semester because any “stupid” comments she made could be reviewed by professors.
“For myself, I think it’s a little intimidating to be a woman in a predominantly male environment,” Louie said. “To know that everything you’re saying is being written down makes it almost a little more scary to raise your hand.”
Louie added that statistics aren’t “highly observable” or “visible,” and HBS can improve in this area. She also said she hoped to see improvements including changes to classroom participation assessments and a future female dean of the school.
“I think we often pay more attention to the way that men say things, or we pay more attention to the comments they make when they say them in a way that’s stereotypically male,” Louie said.
Second-year MBA student and Baker Scholar Ryan Y. Yu said he hopes to see more open conversations within sections about how to promote women’s voices. He recalled section-wide discussions about how to be an ally and create “gender-wise, a more distributed conversation.”
Kenny, the school spokesperson, wrote in the statement that HBS makes inclusion a priority.
“Diversity, inclusion and belonging, including gender and racial equity, are top priorities for everyone at Harvard Business School and we will continue to invest the time and resources needed to improve,” he wrote.
Murday said she felt HBS could better prepare all its students to be better managers of and co-workers to women in the workplace.
Murday referenced the “glass cliff” — the concept that women are more likely to be brought into leadership when the company is struggling and subsequently more likely to be fired. This causes women’s tenures as CEOs to be shorter, so it looks like they’re underperforming, an example of gender-based challenges she said do not come up often enough in the HBS curriculum.
“I think the curriculum could bring in more cases like that, that talk about the challenges that women face in the workforce,” Murday said. “Because, really, this is training leaders who could go out and make a real difference on gender equity in the workplace, but only if prepared and trained to do so.”

After a year of uncertainty, Harvard Square business owners are looking forward to welcoming more tourists and students to the Square in the next few months, now that Covid-19 vaccines are readily available in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
Theodora M. “Theo” Skeadas ’12, executive director of Cambridge Local First, a non-profit network of over 450 local and independent businesses in the city, said the Square would “rebound,” though she recognized that recovery will be “difficult” for some businesses.
“People are really excited to be social and reconnect, and I’ve been walking around the city, all over the place, and it’s just exciting to see people coming back into the Square and engaging with local businesses,” she said. “The challenge is that we lost a lot of businesses and those are not coming back.”
Reflecting on the past year, Nhon T. Ma, co-owner of Zinneken’s Waffles, said he thinks it will “take some time” for Harvard Square to return to normal, though he said his business is “doing fine” for the time being.
“Hopefully we are here to stay for the long run,” he said. “Especially if we survived this past year, I think we can survive almost everything.”
Many Harvard Square businesses struggled to stay open during the Covid-19 pandemic as they dealt with local and state public health restrictions and a significantly smaller customer base.
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said the pandemic was “devastating” to businesses in the Square.
“Business districts everywhere are hurting, struggling,” she said. “Many businesses closed.”
Skeadas agreed with Jillson that the pandemic has been “really hard” for local businesses.
“Harvard Square has witnessed a profound loss of its local business sector in the last three, four, five, even ten years, and those trends amplified during the pandemic,” she said.
Jillson estimated that the number of businesses operating in Harvard Square decreased from 300 in March 2020 to around 270 today.
In the past year, small businesses with decades of history in the Square — like Café Pamplona and Border Cafe — decided to permanently shutter their doors as a result of the pandemic.
Even businesses that remained open faced significant challenges, and were forced to make changes to their operations.
Daniel P. Roughan, owner of Source — a farm-to-table pizzeria that opened in December 2020 in the midst of the pandemic — said the first two months were “absolutely tragic” for his business.
“My accountant, after the first month, told me I should close the business, because at the rate of money we were losing, I would have been bankrupt by February,” he said. "That was all due to Covid.”
“I adjusted and pivoted,” he added. “I said, ‘I am not willing to close.’”
“We closed on Mondays and Tuesdays. I reduced my menu, I got credits back on a lot of product that I had not used, and then we furloughed 50 percent of our staff,” Roughan added. “A very small team of us worked every single day, bared with it, and just kept pushing forward.”
Jillson noted many businesses in Harvard Square survived precisely because they are small, local ventures.
“The strength of our community lies with our smaller businesses. Over 70 percent of our businesses are locally owned and independent,” she said. “Because of that, our decision makers are on the ground here in Harvard Square. Open the door: they’re at the point of sale, they’re stocking shelves, they’re bringing in inventory, and they’re flipping burgers.”
“When the pandemic hit, they had the ability to quickly respond to what was going on,” she added.
As the number of vaccinated people in Cambridge and Massachusetts began to increase, local and state officials started to lift restrictions on businesses accordingly.
Alex Meriwether, general manager of the Harvard Book Store, noted that his store has been able to start gradually returning to its pre-pandemic business model in the past few weeks.
“We’ve been able to extend our hours, and expand capacity a bit at the store, and we’ve seen more customers looking to come shop in-person, as vaccination rolls out,” he said.
He added that his staff members sometimes feel a return to a sense of normalcy at the store.
“We’ve already had some days in the bookstore where our staff and booksellers turn to each other and say, ‘Wow, it actually feels kind of normal today,’ so I think we’re all just going to feel more and more of that, and that’s exciting, and that’s a relief,” he said.
Dana S. Nentin, owner of Playa Bowls, also noted the impact that the University’s gradual return to normal functions has had on her business. She saw an “upward trend” in sales after the start of the spring semester, when the College expanded spring housing to fill 3,100 beds.
“I think with the lifting of restrictions, as well as the full return of students in the fall, we’re hopeful this trend will continue through the summer and into next year as well,” Nentin said.
Ma cautioned, however, that summer has always been “slow” for his business, Zinneken’s Waffles.
“I think we can expect some very slow months ahead,” Ma said. “Hopefully, we can still do some decent business when it comes to delivery, pickup orders, and so on.”
Jillson also acknowledged the Square will likely not have as many visitors this summer as it has had in previous summers.
“We would love to see people from all over the globe, but we know that circumstances will probably prevent that, but we anticipate that we’ll have some visitors, and I look forward to that,” she said. “I believe that by 2022, things will be back to where they were pre-Covid.”
The full return of the student body at Harvard in late August has raised hopes of a rapid return to normal operations. The College, for example, has announced it will accommodate “normal housing density” and host all fall courses in-person.
According to Jillson, the return of thousands of students will revitalize Harvard Square.
“The most important thing for us at the moment is getting the foot traffic back in Harvard Square, so we need the students back, we need the University back, we all need to get back to business,” she said. “When that happens, the economy of the Square will begin to blossom again.”
Skeadas agreed that the impact of students returning to the Square is “huge.”
“Students are thousands of people who partake in the local business ecosystem in different ways. Obviously eating out is a really big one, but also they buy clothes, they shop for different kinds of accessories,” she said. “[Students] are a huge percentage of the city’s population, especially in Harvard Square.”
Despite the difficulties the pandemic wrought, it pushed some businesses to make improvements that will continue to benefit them in the future.
For Roughan, one of the “silver linings” of opening mid-pandemic was the ability to put in “a specialized system that no other restaurant or business at the time had” for its heating, ventilation, and air conditioning.
Meriwether said the pandemic forced the Harvard Book Store to put “a lot of work” into its online ordering system.
“We’ve had an e-commerce business for many, many years, but [we] added staff to that and went through several phases of updating our procedures and workflows around online ordering, and we’ll continue to work on that,” he said.
Jillson said her “appreciation” for the Square and its inhabitants has grown.
“The buildings are here, and we love the buildings, but it’s not the buildings that make up the character of the Square, it’s the people,” she said. “I just have a greater appreciation for the people of all sorts, because they have shown, over this past year, their great strength, their resilience, their perseverance, their grit, and their determination.”

Earlier this semester, Harvard — and many pockets of the academic world — erupted in controversy after Professor Cornel R. West ’74 threatened to leave Harvard for the second time, after the University allegedly denied his request to be considered for tenure.
Ultimately, West — a Professor of the Practice of Public Philosophy at the Harvard Divinity School and of African and African American Studies in the FAS — did elect to leave Harvard, departing for Union Theological Seminary in New York. West, however, is just one of many Black faculty in recent years who have decided to leave Harvard.
Indeed, Dean of the Faculty of the Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay said in a March faculty meeting that, despite the best efforts of University leaders, Black academics at Harvard face “particular challenges” in addition to already-rigorous teaching and research responsibilities.
“Our ultimate goal is not just about recruitment and promotion,” Gay said. “It’s also about creating a community in which a diverse faculty, including Black faculty, can thrive. And that’s where we still have work to do.”
Following West’s threat to depart, student organizers rallied in support of granting him tenure and said the controversy spoke to overarching issues that faculty of color face at Harvard.
Injil Muhammad Jr. ’21, a former president of the Black Men’s Forum and a contributor to a student-run petition, said the University’s alleged refusal to reconsider West for tenure was a “slap in the face.”
“Regardless of his race, the fact that professor Cornel West was denied tenure consideration was ridiculous. But then you consider the fact that he’s Black,” Muhammad said. “It just shows that our contributions are not valued as highly as others, quite frankly.”
In an interview with the Chronicle of Higher Education, West said that his situation and treatment by the University was emblematic of “a much larger crisis in higher education.”
“Black scholars and too many others are too often disrespected, devalued, or dismissed,” West said.
In response to a recent survey of all FAS faculty conducted by The Crimson, 50 percent of surveyed faculty strongly disagreed that Harvard has a healthy level of BIPOC representation within the FAS’s ranks, with another 30 percent somewhat disagreeing. Just seven percent of respondents believed that the FAS had healthy BIPOC representation.
Following West’s statements, Gay underscored Harvard’s efforts to support faculty of color.
“I will state unequivocally that the entire academic leadership of the FAS is committed to recruiting, retaining, and enabling the research and teaching of a diverse faculty,” Gay said at a faculty meeting.
The University has made some progress recruiting and keeping diverse faculty in the last decade.
Harvard’s publicly available faculty demographic data does not disaggregate racial or ethnic groups within the category of “underrepresented minorities,” which encompasses faculty who identify as Latino, Black or African American, Native American or Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander.
According to the latest annual report from the Office of the Senior Vice Provost for Faculty Development and Diversity, 15 percent of faculty appointed to tenure or tenure-track positions across the University in the last four years identified as underrepresented minorities. In a comparable time period from 2007 to 2011, just 10 percent of new tenure and tenure-track hires identified as such.
Yet, change in the faculty through hiring has been relatively slow — and the faculty remains largely white. While five percent of tenured faculty and 11 percent of tenure-track faculty in 2007 identified as underrepresented minorities, those numbers have only increased to eight percent and 13 percent in 2021, respectively.
Among underrepresented racial minority groups, women may also face unique challenges. Notably, not a single female professor from an underrepresented minority group holds a tenure-track engineering or science position. Just one underrepresented female professor holds tenure in the sciences — and none hold tenure in engineering.
Gay said the challenges of recruiting and retaining a diverse faculty are longstanding issues.
“It took generations for us to arrive at where we are right now. It’ll take time — hopefully not generations — to change,” Gay said in a March interview with The Crimson. “Change takes time. It doesn’t seem like a profound statement. It just seems obvious.”
Vincent A. Brown, Professor of American History and of African and African American Studies, has been at Harvard since 2002, but wrote in an email that the departure of Black colleagues the last few years have been “difficult.”
For Brown, one particular challenge as a Black scholar is seeing his colleagues depart each year, making it difficult to find community. In the past few years, on top of West’s departure, he has seen professor Marla F. Frederick leave for Emory, professor Laurence A. Ralph depart to Princeton, and professor Elizabeth K. Hinton — whom he wrote was one of the History department’s “brightest stars” — accept a position at Yale.
And on Tuesday, members of the African and African American Studies faculty learned that professor Braxton D. Shelley had also opted to leave Harvard for Yale starting in the fall of 2021.
“Now, part of this is just a natural progression. People move on, great new colleagues arrive, places change,” Brown wrote. “But for those of us left behind, there is always the question of how to rebuild your community — and whether you can do it here or feel that it's time to start over someplace else.”
Organismic and Evolutionary Biology professor Scott V. Edwards, who last year biked 3,200 miles to raise support for the Black Lives Matter movement, said that he often feels “isolated” as a Black scholar at Harvard, especially since “ there are diverse worlds out there.”
“In other words, it’s not a question of, ‘Can we have diversity at the highest levels of scholarship at Harvard?’” Edwards said. “So when you see it in other contexts, it becomes even more important to build it at Harvard.”
Gay — the first person of color to serve as FAS dean — also acknowledged these burdens borne by Black faculty members.
“We know that faculty of color continue to face particular challenges that other faculty do not. It’s not easy to be the first person of color in your department,” she said at a faculty meeting. “Faculty of color are advancing their teaching and research and fulfilling their commitment to academic excellence, and doing so right alongside others who do not face the same demands.”
The departures of Black scholars have also had a profound effect on the experiences of Black students at the College.
Kyra I. March ’22, former president of the Association of Black Harvard Women, said she worries about the lack of intersectionality at Harvard. There are no Black female professors in the Women, Gender, and Sexuality program, according to March, and only one Black professor.
“It’s just sad because you have these white professors talking about how they value intersectionality and how they’re dedicated to diversifying the different readings that we have in the classroom, but the people who are leading these courses are not Black,” March said.
Muhammad shared a similar sentiment, calling it “a really powerful experience” to be taught by Black faculty.
“When you get the chance to see Black faculty at the front of a classroom defining the curriculum, selecting the readings, informing the discussion, that experience is just unparalleled,” he said.
“And to be able to do that with someone who looks like you at the front of the classroom just does wonders for your confidence, your ability to feel comfortable — and it's honestly empowering,” he added.
Though student organizations came together in support of West, March said advocating for more Black representation in faculty should not be a “Black or other POC-org problem.” Rather, the onus should be on the administration to create change.
“Making student organizations do all this work is really just making things worse, because that’s just using our energy for things that we shouldn’t have to advocate for,” March said. “We shouldn’t have to ask them to bring in Black women faculty or to keep professors who have made such large changes in the field of Black studies.”
March said though she feels fortunate to have been taught by West and Hinton, she worries that their departures will hamper the experiences of future students, who will not be able to take courses like West’s AAAS 10: “Introduction to African American Studies.”
“There’s going to be this void that needs to be filled, and I don’t know how the college and the department are going to fill it and fill it soon,” March said.
Muhammad agreed, saying that West’s firing was “completely demoralizing” for his academic trajectory.
“As someone who wants to be a Black scholar — and is a Black scholar at Harvard — if Cornel West can’t get tenure, then there’s no hope for me to do anything,” he said.
Muhammad called upon the University to grant tenure to more Black scholars, which would allow them to “have the flexibility and the competence to speak their minds.”
“They can start by starting to give amazing black faculty tenure and tenure consideration. Representation is important and it's important in and of itself,” Muhammad said.
Beyond hiring and retaining more Black faculty, Edwards said reconsidering other aspects of the University — such as staff hiring — may help make Harvard a more inclusive space for Black scholars.
“Harvard does hire faculty slowly, but I also know that we’ve had opportunities that we simply haven’t grasped,” Edwards said.
Edwards said that though OEB has “hardworking, really wonderful” staff members, they are not as ethnically diverse as one might like.
“Faculty and students are dealing with staff every day, and we just need to work harder in that area,” he continued.
In the last couple years, the University has added to its leadership ranks Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer Sherri A. Charleston, Associate Dean for Inclusion and Belonging Alta Mauro, and FAS Associate Dean of Diversity, Belonging, and Inclusion Sheree Ohen.
Charleston, Harvard’s inaugural CDIO, wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard has a “commitment to making demonstrable progress” in the field of diversity while recognizing “there is much work to be done.”
“Creating a culture of inclusiveness is core to [the Office of Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging’s] mission, and integral to maintaining a vibrant intellectual and academic community at Harvard,” she wrote. “But it’s only something we will achieve by working collectively as a community to ensure that our actions meet our aspirations.”
“There is concerted effort underway across our schools to identify tangible ways to recruit and retain faculty who bring new perspectives, scholarship, and innovative teaching,” she continued.
Despite the University’s recent recommitment to diversity and inclusion, Muhammad said he was “not optimistic at all” that the University would make good on its commitment to Black scholars.
“Professor Cornel West being denied tenure consideration was the quintessential example of their not adhering to that claim,” Muhammad said. “He’s a world-renowned intellectual, world-renowned professor. So that just shows that it’s probably not going to happen for anybody else either.”
Nonetheless, West said he had a “wonderful talk” with Gay after he had made the decision to leave Harvard, in which he advised her on how to retain faculty of color at Harvard.
“I told her that I want to do all I can to make sure that she’s able to push through to get high quality candidates of color and gender,” West said. “I can do that at a distance. I don’t have to be at Harvard to do that.”
Gay reaffirmed the FAS’s commitment to supporting Black scholars during a faculty meeting.
“Harvard as a place where Black scholars can succeed is what we are committed to as an institution,” she said. “It’s the future we need and are striving to build, and getting there has my full attention.”

Less than a year ago, Harvard’s graduate student union ratified its first contract with the University, ending 19 months of negotiations. Now, the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers is back at the bargaining table negotiating for its second contract.
Eight sessions in, a number of key contentions that dominated the previous contract negotiations have returned to the forefront: increased compensation and health care benefits, stronger non-discrimination procedures, international student worker protections, and agency shop – the requirement that all student workers pay the union for representation.
Thus far, HGSU-UAW has proposed changes to more than half of the articles in its current contract, which is set to expire on June 30.
University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, who oversees the negotiations from the University's side, wrote in an update to Harvard affiliates on Friday that the current contract addresses much of the union’s concerns.
“In June 2020, the University and HGSU-UAW agreed to their first-ever contract,” Garber wrote. “This contract is comprehensive and thoughtfully addresses many of the labor concerns of our student workers, while also ensuring the core academic and research values are maintained.”
As bargaining heats up, especially on the longtime points of contention, HGSU-UAW members have pointed to other Harvard unions and graduate student unions at peer institutions that have already won or are pushing for similar provisions.
The Crimson compared HGSU-UAW’s latest contract proposals to its inaugural contract, other Harvard unions’ contracts, and recent agreements and proposals from graduate student unions at other private universities. We examined the contracts of four graduate student unions that have been at the forefront of organizing and conducted bargaining during the pandemic: the unions at New York University, Columbia University, Georgetown University, and Brown University.
In 2001, NYU’s Graduate Student Organizing Committee-United Automobile Workers was the first graduate student union at a private university to secure a contract. After going on strike for three weeks, union members are voting this week on whether to ratify their third contract.
The Graduate Workers of Columbia-United Automobile Workers, Columbia’s student union, also went on strike this spring. While GWC-UAW secured its first tentative agreement just after the strike, membership rejected the tentative agreement and the union is electing a new bargaining committee next month.
And just months before HGSU-UAW secured its contract last year, the Georgetown Alliance of Graduate Employees and the Graduate Labor Organization at Brown both ratified their first-ever contracts last spring.
Compensation — in the form of yearly salaries and hourly rates, depending on position — makes reappearances at nearly every bargaining table. HGSU-UAW is currently proposing an immediate 9.74 percent increase for all salaried workers, with 3 percent increases every following year. The current contract stipulates a 2.8 percent annual raise for salaried workers except those in the Extension School, who will not receive a raise, and those in the School of Public Health, who will receive a set raise of $198.
For all workers with hourly wages, the union is proposing a minimum rate of $23 an hour, an increase from the current minimum of $16 an hour for research employees and $17 an hour for instructional employees.
To arrive at these numbers, HGSU-UAW Bargaining Committee compared compensation for graduate student unions across different universities, public and private, and used the MIT living wage calculator to adjust for the local cost of living, according to Bargaining Committee member Cory W. McCartan, a Statistics Ph.D. candidate.
In comparison, Brown’s current agreement with GLO — which does not apply to any hourly workers — stipulates a 2.5 percent stipend raise for the first year. GLO and Brown met again early this year to renegotiate next year’s stipends, and the union won parity for its members in the Humanities and Social Sciences with those in the Sciences. Humanities and Social Sciences workers will receive a total 10.59 percent increase over 12 months to match their Sciences colleagues, who received a 4.59 percent raise.
In the first year under GAGE’s contract with Georgetown, student workers in 12-month positions are set to receive a raise from $31,000 to $35,500 and those in academic year positions will jump from $29,000 to $32,500. Master’s research and teaching assistants will be granted a minimum hourly wage raise from $13.50 to $19.50 this year. All categories of workers will receive a minimum 2 percent annual raise for the remaining two years of the contract.
NYU GSOC-UAW’s tentative agreement secures annual increases of 2.75 to 3 percent for salaried Ph.D. students and an increase in minimum hourly rate from $20 to $26 with back-dated pay beginning fall 2020. By the last year of the contract, the minimum hourly rate would be $30.
In the tentative agreement with Columbia, which was ultimately rejected by membership last month, GWC-UAW won percentage yearly increases for salaried workers and an increase in the minimum rate for hourly workers from $15 in the first year to $20 by the third year of the contract.
In its second contract negotiations with Harvard, the union has presented health care proposals which it estimates will cost an additional $14 million — approximately 8 percent of what it says the University currently pays in salaries and benefits for in-unit student workers. HGSU-UAW is proposing Harvard provide full health coverage for individuals and dependents, as well as dental insurance, to everyone except student workers working less than 100 hours in six months, who would pay part of their premium costs.
The University requires students to be covered by the Student Health Insurance Plan or comparable health insurance. Under the current contract, Harvard only provides no-premium individual health care for Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Ph.D. candidates and has a $125,000 Health Care Reimbursement Fund for student workers on SHIP. Student workers can apply to the fund to reimburse copays for prescription drugs, mental health and specialist visits, and out-of-pocket expenses as a result of exceeding the limit on mental health and specialist visits.
To help defray premiums and expenses for child care and dependents’ health care, Harvard agreed in the first contract to establish two funds. Salaried student workers can apply to the $325,000 Dependent Insurance Fund to help cover premiums for spouses and dependents and the $350,000 Childcare Fund to reimburse child care expenses. HGSU-UAW is now proposing a $8,000 child care subsidy per year instead of the current reimbursement model.
“We believe that this is an important step toward equity because it reduces the administrative burden of processing requests, and ensures equity in access and distribution,” Victoria ‘Vicki’ Dzindzichashvili, a HGSU-UAW Bargaining Committee member and Kennedy School student, wrote in a bargaining update in late April.
The union is also proposing an expansion of the definition of “dependent” to include “qualified adults,” which would cover partners who are not married.
HGSU-UAW Bargaining Committee member Ash E. Tomaszewski — a Law School student — previously studied at the University of Michigan, which provided a free dental plan and covered 93 percent of individual health care premiums under the contract with its graduate employee union, Graduate Employees’ Organization. When Tomaszewski came to Harvard a year ago, they said they lost their dental coverage and faced increased premiums for health care coverage.
“It’s kind of ridiculous that you can work your entire life, you can dream of going to Harvard, and you get in, and your quality of living goes down,” Tomaszewski said.
Compared to Harvard’s current contract, private university student unions with recent negotiation wins have had mixed results in terms of health care benefits. Brown already covers premiums for individual health insurance and offers discounts for some dental and vision services for graduate student workers under its health plan. Under GLO and Brown’s contract, the university will set up a health reimbursement account; if the university fails to do so, student workers will receive $500 in fiscal year 2021 and $600 in fiscal year 2022. For dependents, Brown does provide a 75 percent subsidy on health insurance and dental insurance for all dependents and a $5,000 child care subsidy for dependent children. Georgetown covers individual health and dental premium costs for Ph.D. candidates under GAGE’s current contract, but not for Master’s candidates, and both still need to pay for dependent and vision care.
NYU GSOC-UAW’s new tentative agreement, on the other hand, includes sweeping increases in benefits: increasing individual premium coverage from 90 to 95 percent, establishing a new $300,000 fund for out-of-pocket expenses that will expand to $700,000 during the life of the contract, increasing a subsidy for dependent premiums and extending it to Master’s degree candidates, and scaling up a fund for child care expenses. Similarly, in the rejected GWC-UAW tentative agreement, Columbia’s graduate student union won fully-subsidized individual and dependent premiums for Ph.D. candidates at all schools and doubled its child care subsidy to $4,000.
The first contract between HGSU-UAW and Harvard establishes a three-step grievance procedure culminating in neutral third-party arbitration if the two sides cannot resolve complaints. However, identity-based discrimination, sexual harassment, and academic retaliation complaints are not able to be pursued under the grievance procedure; instead, they are processed through the University’s or individual schools’ policies.
HGSU-UAW has long pushed for discrimination and harassment complaints to be grievable under the contract procedure, including the possibility of neutral third-party arbitration. Under the current model, the union alleges, Harvard has failed to redress, or even acknowledge, some complaints when students accused faculty and staff.
Harvard has staunchly opposed allowing union members to pursue such complaints under a grievance procedure, arguing that consistent procedures must be applied University-wide.
In its second contract, the union wants the option of third-party arbitration extended to discrimination, harassment, and retaliation complaints, which it argues is necessary to protect students who come forward and offer them an external process. HGSU-UAW has also proposed an expansion of the classifications protected by the non-discrimination article, including medical conditions, gender expression, and accents.
While those types of complaints are not currently pursuable under the grievance procedure, the first contract includes a side letter that establishes union representation in non-discrimination and harassment working groups. HGSU-UAW now appoints two of the four student representatives serving on Harvard’s existing Title IX Policy Review Advisory Committee, which recommends changes to the University’s policies on sexual and gender-based harassment.
The first contract also created two new working groups to address other forms of discrimination: the Non-discrimination Policy Working Group and the Anti-bullying Policy Working Group. HGSU-UAW appoints two student workers to each of the committees. While the working groups have no set deadline in the contract to issue recommendations, “the parties agree that any such recommendations regarding policies and procedures will include, at a minimum, a final appeals panel of impartial and unbiased members.”
HGSU-UAW feels that the working groups alone are insufficient.
“While we want the working groups’ recommendations to be incorporated into Harvard’s policies, we also believe it is urgent that we have stronger protections in the contract currently being negotiated,” Dzindzichashvili wrote in the late April update to union members.
McCartan added in an emailed statement that the working groups’ recommendations are not binding; graduate students, he wrote, need “fairer, speedier, and safer options.”
“The working groups are an important part of our broad effort to fix systemic issues of harassment and discrimination at Harvard,” he wrote. “They provide a path to improve internal university processes, which will still be around whether we secure third-party arbitration or not. However, they are only empowered to make recommendations on a narrow set of issues, which the University is under no obligation to implement.”
Elsewhere at Harvard, the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers does have the option of third-party arbitration for sexual harassment complaints. Beyond Cambridge, other graduate student unions have had mixed degrees of success securing the right to pursue discrimination and harassment complaints under grievance procedures. GSOC-UAW at NYU has third-party arbitration for all such complaints. Meanwhile, student workers at Columbia and Brown must submit complaints through internal university procedures before they can appeal decisions to a third-party panel. Like HGSU-UAW, GAGE at Georgetown has no third-party recourse for discrimination and harassment complaints.
The pandemic pushed HGSU-UAW to call for greater protections and resources for international student workers.
The current contract includes six provisions for international student workers. If an international student already employed by Harvard finds themselves stuck abroad, they will continue to be employed by the University; if a student already employed is suddenly unable to work as a result of their immigration status, the University will “make reasonable efforts to re-employ the [student worker] as soon as possible.” Harvard also grants international student workers five days of paid leave to attend visa and immigration proceedings for themselves and family members, and maintains a list of immigration attorneys. The first contract also created a University-wide working group to evaluate Harvard’s English language resources.
Other graduate student unions’ contracts, much like HGSU-UAW’s current one, contain provisions to maintain employment if an international student worker is stuck outside the U.S. and commit to supporting union members through immigration proceedings.
NYU GSOC-UAW’s tentative agreement also includes a new side letter for international and immigrant student worker protections. If ratified, NYU will not provide information to government agencies for the purpose of detention or deportation based on immigration status, nor will it let “representatives of any governmental agency” enter school buildings for those reasons, including police and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
In its current negotiations, HGSU-UAW is asking Harvard for additional support for international students: the union wants to expand the release time clause — periods that employees may use for work-related commitments outside of their typical duties — so that student workers have greater flexibility in case of immigration issues. In addition, instead of providing the list of attorneys, the union is proposing Harvard establish free legal advising for immigration issues.
Of Harvard’s 10 unions, HGSU-UAW is the only union with an open shop, meaning that HGSU-UAW represents students in its unit regardless of whether they pay dues. Under an open shop, membership in the union during employment is optional and students in the bargaining unit who choose not to join the union are not required to pay fees for representation.
Under an agency shop model, however, all members of the bargaining unit are required to pay the union for representation.
“[Agency shop] would make the union financially in a much better position,” said HGSU-UAW steward Sebastian B. Spitz. “This is a very normal thing — that if you’re represented by a union, you pay dues to the union.”
HGSU-UAW proposed an agency shop at its second bargaining session this year to “share the cost of representation across the unit.” The union has not received the University’s counter-proposal.
Although Harvard is one of eight graduate student unions at a private university to have secured a contract, it is the only such union to have an open shop: NYU, the New School, Georgetown, Brown, Brandeis University, Tufts University, and American University all have unions with agency shop. Columbia's union also secured an agency shop in its first tentative agreement.

A boat blowout in Boston Harbor. A clubhouse bash in Harvard Square. An orchard fête in northern Massachusetts.
Some students, determined to end a fraught school year on a note of normalcy, defied Harvard’s Covid-19 rules this past semester in the name of fun — and to the chagrin of some of their classmates.
Concerned by a spike in Covid-19 cases among undergraduates living on and near campus this spring, University administrators have urged students to continue observing public health practices and avoiding gatherings.
“Here in Cambridge and near campus, we see some worrisome trends in the number of positive cases, especially among students living together off-campus,” Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair and Harvard University Health Services Director Giang T. Nguyen wrote in an April 16 email. “It is spring, the weather is warming up, and we know that you want to gather with each other; please do this safely, using sound public health practices to avoid risks to you, your friends, and other community members.”
Harvard’s residential guidelines during the pandemic are outlined in a “community compact,” which on-campus undergraduates — mostly juniors and seniors this past spring — were required to sign. By signing the compact, students pledged to adhere to University Covid-19 guidelines, which prohibit large gatherings and mandate mask-wearing, among other provisions.
Harvard also introduced a color-coded system this past semester to indicate different phases of campus reopening and restricted on-campus students from traveling more than 10 miles off campus.
While many students in the Cambridge area socialized cautiously this spring, others flouted Harvard’s compact at crowded parties — at times maskless and indoors. Since February, the Harvard University Police Department has responded to at least 17 reports of loud parties, according to HUPD’s public log.
On May 13, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its Covid-19 guidelines to lift mask and social distancing mandates for vaccinated individuals in nearly all settings. Even before then, though, many Harvard students forwent masks and social distancing throughout the semester to gather at final clubs, off-campus apartments, and lavish celebrations.
Those escapades, heavily documented in photos and videos circulated on social media and obtained by The Crimson, became a flashpoint of campus debate over how Harvard students should balance socializing with a responsibility to their community.
Samyra C. Miller ’21, whose Instagram account became a prominent platform for College news and discourse over the last year, frequently criticized student partygoers and shared images of their gatherings to her audience of more than 5,000 followers.
“It’s one thing to go to the parties, gatherings, or whatever — it’s another thing to post about it,” Miller said in an interview. “You just don’t care. You have no shame.”
During a typical year, the end of the spring semester leads into Senior Week — a weeklong celebration building up to Commencement.
But the Class of 2021’s final semester has looked markedly different due to Covid-19. Seniors vacated campus dorms before Senior Week and will graduate virtually, as the Class of 2020 did last year. To safely socialize this spring, some seniors said they restricted the number of people and settings in which they met.
Sophia “Rocket” Claman ’21 said she drastically limited her social interaction this spring to comply with Harvard’s pandemic-era rules.
“I was never in a room with more than three other people for the entirety of the semester,” Claman said. “If I was hanging out with somebody else, it was just one other person at a time.”
Sonya Kalara ’21, who has lived with friends off campus since the fall, said navigating socializing this spring “got a little more complicated” because Harvard invited more students to campus.
“I got to really dictate what I was comfortable with from a Covid perspective and pretty much until this point has been entirely outdoors,” they said. “Even when it was raining I’d hang out with people outdoors and get Ubers back and forth between places.”
“It has been difficult because a lot of my friends are about as Covid-safe as I am,” Kalara added.
Wilfried K. Zibell ’21, who said he has refrained from socializing in groups in adherence to health guidelines, said the pandemic has eroded his relationships with “casual acquaintances.”
“Except very recently, there have only really been individual hangs,” he said. “There are a great deal of people that I know in a group setting that I have not really interacted with ever individually.”
Though many students strictly adhered to Covid-19 guidelines, others were resolved to enjoy a traditional college semester of partying.
The first large gatherings violating Harvard guidelines Miller witnessed this spring occurred during River Run, an annual tradition many freshmen participate in the night before they receive their upperclassman housing assignments.
“I didn’t even know that there were that many first-years on campus until that night, when they were literally all in herds,” Miller said. “Big clumps with no masks, and this is before the majority of people were getting vaccinated.”
Miller said she saw roughly 30 rowdy students in a circle chanting “What do we want? Cabot! When do we want it? Now!”
From her dorm room in Lowell House, Miller said she could see the entrances of two final clubs — the Fly Club and Owl Club — and hear parties taking place at their locations.
“That kind of amped up toward the end as more people were getting vaccinated, and they were gathering in larger groups,” she said. “Even just the night before I left campus the Owl had another huge party.”
Taking to Instagram to publicize and condemn the large gatherings, Miller reposted videos from students who shared media of themselves attending parties. One video appeared to show dozens of students partying without masks inside the Spee Club; another recorded a mass of maskless young people clad in white dancing on a yacht in Massachusetts Bay.
A student leader of the Owl Club did not respond to a request for comment. Student leaders of the Fly Club and Spee Club could not be reached for comment.
Miller said classmates have reacted both positively and negatively to her posts.
“Some people appreciate that I will call parties out and that I’m trying to make sure that people are doing things safely and socializing safely,” Miller said. “Other people — most of the people participating in the risky activities — are more so upset.”
Claman, a Crimson Blog and Arts editor, said she gives Miller “huge props and credit” for providing students, including herself, information over social media that they could not receive elsewhere.
Zibell, who lived on campus this year, said on-campus partying appeared less prevalent in the spring compared to the fall semester, when Harvard housed predominantly freshmen.
“I have not encountered or heard of or even heard rumors of any parties or large gatherings on campus housing,” he said. “This basically entirely contradicts my experience living on campus in the fall, when I heard a lot of freshmen partying.”
In the fall, Harvard dismissed three freshmen from campus housing after they hosted a September party in Mather House with at least three other students. Some students also reported seeing large gatherings by the Charles River and in campus courtyards.
Though Harvard dorm rooms were not the site of parties, off-campus gatherings abounded, according to Zibell.
At the end of the semester, Kalara said they witnessed a student cultural organization holding a large social function off campus.
“They were playing drinking games and going inside of a house and passing around a joint during a respiratory disease, which is the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard,” they said.
The Community Council — composed of students, faculty, and staff — reviews violations of the community compact and issues “non-disciplinary” responses to noncompliant students, including removal from on-campus housing. Last fall, more than 200 students violated the compact, and 32 were removed from on-campus housing.
In response to reports of student parties in violation of public health guidelines, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana told The Crimson in an interview this month that he trusts Harvard students are “always trying to do the right thing.”
“I just am so confident in our students,” he said. “This is an educational institution — they’re learning about themselves, they’re learning about each other.”
“As human beings, we sometimes make mistakes,” Khurana added. “I just think we have to be really gentle on each other. This has been such a difficult time for human beings, and especially for young people.”
But Kalara said they believe Harvard students attending parties have “no excuse” for their behavior during a pandemic.
“I don’t care if I’m a little too conservative about the way that I act with Covid. I don’t want to be the reason that someone else dies or ends up having long-term lung damage,” Kalara said. “If you’re a Harvard student and you clearly have the intelligence to know that and you decide not to, it just represents a profound selfishness.”
Claman said she believes the flagrant partying is “highly irresponsible” and “really disrespectful.” Claman was frustrated viewing videos of large gatherings, which she said illustrate socioeconomic disparities among students.
“It certainly, to me, appeared to be divided along class lines, as people who had a lot more wealth were able to travel the world or go to all these clubs and kind of ignore pandemic rules in a lot of instances,” she said.
Some students were more sympathetic toward their party-going peers.
W. Samuel Markowitz ’21-’22, who spent the semester living off campus in the Cambridge area, said he empathizes with the Class of 2021 in particular.
“I do empathize quite a bit because it’s their last years, their final chance to hang out with friends and have these fun times,” he said.
Still, Markowitz said his peers’ rash behavior perturbed him at times.
“It annoys me,” he said. “Public safety should come before all of that.”
“We are so close. You’re so close to some sense of normalcy,” he added. “Why take these risks?”
Miller acknowledged students’ disappointment that Covid-19 disrupted their college experiences, but said she is “embarrassed” to attend Harvard with students indifferent to public health guidance.
“If some of them want to go run for public office, or be doctors someday — you will not be my doctor, you will not be my senator, you won’t be my president. It’s not happening,” Miller said.
Khurana said he does not feel comfortable “judging” students for their conduct during a global crisis.
“I would say to other people, please don’t define somebody by their worst moment, or if they kind of made a mistake,” he said. “I believe that most people are incredibly good. It’s the circumstances you have to understand that lead people not to be able to be their best self.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Professional basketball player Jeremy Lin ’10 encouraged the graduating Class of 2021 to seek community and embrace their identities in the pursuit of success during Harvard College’s virtual Class Day Wednesday.
Lin is known for being the first American of Chinese or Taiwanese descent to play in the NBA and the first Asian American to win an NBA championship. He shot to global fame in 2012 when he led the New York Knicks in a winning run known as “Linsanity.”
Harvard announced in February it would postpone Commencement Exercises and hold virtual ceremonies for the second consecutive year due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
“When I was first asked to speak at Class Day, in true student-athlete fashion, I tried to turn down this extra writing assignment,” Lin said in his address. “But I get it. In a year all about diversity and inclusion, you needed a token. So here I am, your token Asi—athlete.”
At one point, the camera shifted to reveal Lin wearing shorts — casual attire he quipped as another example of him “breaking barriers.”
Lin also reflected on what his Harvard degree has meant to him as a professional athlete.
“I want to say that having a degree from Harvard has done absolutely nothing for me. Seriously, it hasn’t helped me at all in my chosen profession,” he said. “If anything, it was just a quick, easy way to spend $200,000 and feel superior to Cornell grads.”
“Still, I’m really glad I have it, and I’m really proud to be a part of this community,” he added.
Lin said his reputation as “the Asian basketball player” when he first gained notoriety puzzled him, but that he eventually came to realize his heritage as a strength, not a weakness.
“I’ve come to understand that my identity is part of my superpower,” he said. “Even though I will always be more than an Asian American basketball player, just as each of you are more than your backgrounds, who I am and where I come from is woven into everything that I do. That’s the cold, hard Veritas.”
Lin implored the Class of 2021 in his speech to not undervalue the importance of community when achieving success.
“I hope that you will take your identity and whatever background and life experiences you have to help change the lives of those around you,” he said. “Because after being at the top of the world during Linsanity, I can tell you that success without community is absolutely meaningless.”
Wednesday’s Class Day program opened with remarks from First Marshal Samyra C. Miller ’21 and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana.
Khurana lauded seniors for their resilience in the face of immense uncertainty this past year.
“Meeting this moment has required more than flexibility. It has required courage, and it has required patience,” he said. “In this past year you may have been slowed, but you didn’t stop. You may have bent, but you didn’t break. You pivoted. You tacked. You reimagined. You never gave up.”
Incoming Harvard Alumni Association President Vanessa W. Liu ’96 welcomed seniors to the HAA, and Olivia S. Farrar ’21 delivered the Harvard Oration, analyzing the Class of 2021’s journey through the lens of Edgar Allan Poe’s theories about what makes a “great story.” She argued against Poe’s belief that an author should only begin writing a story once they know its ending.
“I don’t think a good author has to know the ending before they start writing. None of us could have predicted the pandemic. But I think very few of us could have predicted the people we would be today — pandemic or no pandemic,” she said. “That’s how true writing and living goes. It’s setting forward, stepping out of your door or into an unknown cadence of words and sentences, and hoping that your feet and your fingers find the way.”
“And if the degree we are each being awarded shows anything, it’s this — we did find our way,” she added.
Marie A. Konopacki ’21 delivered the Ivy Oration, joking about the day Harvard sent students home due to the pandemic, the trials and tribulations of Zoom classes, and the mystery identity of last year’s planned Yardfest headliner.
“We remember March 10, 2020 — the day Harvard told us they were sending us home — like it was yesterday,” she said. “Well, actually, some of us only remember that morning.”
“I will miss some parts of this odd digital education we got. My typing speed has never been faster and my eyesight has never been worse,” Konopacki said. “Breakout rooms put me face-to-face with incredible people I never would have met.”
“Did we exchange any words?” she added. “No.”
Second Marshal Prashanth “PK” Kumar ’21 delivered closing remarks. Mario O. Haskett Jr. ’21 capped off the event with a performance of the 2021 Class Ode.
The University-wide virtual ceremony for the Class of 2021 will take place Thursday, featuring a principal address from Prairie View A&M University President Ruth J. Simmons.

To Our Readers:
The 2021 “Year in Sports” edition marks a third supplement that The Crimson Sports Board has completed during the hiatus in Ivy League sports. This should, however, be our last in this style. And we are certainly grateful. In the fall, our writers look forward to attending games, interviewing student-athletes live, writing game stories, and following the weekly tidbits that a team produces over the course of a long season. This year in sports has been lean, but we look forward to a full slate of action on the field, court, track, ice, mat, and anywhere else competition occurs.
That being said, not all has been lost. There are still plenty of stories to follow. Sure, without seasons being played during the 2020-21 academic calendar, we do not have the traditional superlatives to award, such as “team of the year” and “athlete of the year,” but there are nonetheless stories that capture the talent, achievement, and work ethic of Harvard’s student-athletes. This year, Crimson athletes were activists, reunited siblings, and professionals, in the sports world and beyond. Moreover, the last year has allowed us to reflect on how university policies have affected student-athletes and their eligibility, and whether or not student-athletes handled the last year differently than students at large. And finally, this sports commencement edition has still allowed outgoing seniors to reflect. For example, two-term sports chair Joey Minatel gives his “parting shot.”
As we look forward to the fall, a bright future seems to be drawing nearer and nearer. But before we turn the page on the past year, let us first appreciate the memories, stories, and experiences that continue to define our student-athletes and shape our campus. While Harvard’s fields, stadiums, and arenas may have remained quiet in 2020-2021, a lot has gone on over the past year and continues to go on right now. Before we move on, we should take the chance to look back.
Sincerely,
William C. Boggs ’22 | Sports Chair
A.J. Dilts ’23 | Sports Chair

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When RuQuan Brown was seven years old, he stumbled upon football and first developed what would become a passion and a lifelong love affair. His older cousins, who the only child looked up to as his brothers, played the sport. It was Atlanta Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan, whom Brown watched on TV, who captured his attention. And it was his stepfather, who instilled in the young boy that he could make football his career.
12 years later, Brown is a rising sophomore at the College and a multi-positional talent on the football field. Before coming to Harvard, he starred for three years at Roosevelt High School in Washington, D.C., where he played quarterback, wide receiver, cornerback, running back, safety, kick returner, and punt returner. He was named captain of the team all three years he played and team MVP after his sophomore season, when he led Roosevelt to the D.C. State Championship. Furthermore, he was named All-League and All-State in his junior year, and was on the All-DMV (D.C., Maryland, and Virginia) team his senior year.
Brown’s football talent has afforded him plenty of unique opportunities. He has appeared on New England Patriots cornerbacks Devin and Jason McCourty’s podcast, “Double Coverage” (Devin still plays for the Patriots, but Jason now plays for the Miami Dolphins). Then, a few days prior to the 2021 NFL Draft, he traveled to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., to train with Elijah Moore, a University of Mississippi receiver who would go on to become a second-round selection by the New York Jets, and former Auburn University receiver Anthony Schwartz, who would be drafted by the Cleveland Browns.
“That was probably the most influential moment to me, being around those guys who are three years older than me and to be in the same space as them and put in the same amount of work and have those conversations with them about what the process is going to look like — about what it takes to be a draft pick,” Brown said. “Two days later these guys are getting their call from the general manager of a team, saying, ‘We want to select you with this pick in the draft.’ So to be able to have spent time with those guys and ask questions days before that just encourages me to keep going, and I only have three more years until I’m in that position.”
Despite all of his accomplishments on the field and his eventual desire to play in the NFL, Brown would be the first to say he is not just a football player. He is also a student, entrepreneur, and activist, which he credits partly to his high school experience; although he starred at Roosevelt High, he actually attended nearby Banneker Academic High, which did not have a football team.
“It was sort of the perfect pre-Harvard experience, where [I had] an entirely different academic and athletic world,” he explained.
He received offers from 25 different universities, including seven members of the Ivy League. Ultimately, though, he chose Harvard because it offered him the best chance to explore his other interests and gain access to its diverse and accomplished alumni network.
“When I chose, I was choosing with the place in my heart that wants to accomplish things in life,” Brown said with a smile. “I want to be able to have access to some of the most amazing people. I’ve already gotten to do that in football, but wanting to do that in the classroom as well is a desire that I felt I could achieve by coming to this institution.”
On and off the field, Brown can be best defined by his resilience and faith. Growing up between Seattle, Dallas, and Washington, D.C., he was deeply affected by both gun violence and domestic violence. In 2017, he lost a teammate to gun violence; a year later, his stepfather, with whom he had first been inspired to play football for a living, was murdered. Compounding the losses in his personal life, he then was forced to sit on the sidelines during practices his first-year fall at Harvard after tearing his ACL in March 2020.
Brown’s recovery process has required all the inner strength and willpower that he has learned throughout his life. Not being able to run plays with his teammates was challenging for him, but the process taught him to value patience and humility even more. However, even though his recovery has helped him grow as a person, he downplays the importance of football on developing his character. While the sport has constituted a major part of his journey, giving him opportunities he might not otherwise have had, and the platform to speak out on issues that are important to him, he primarily credits his personal experiences for his tenacity.
“I’m grateful for the things that I’ve had to experience as a youth, the things that I had to see, for the abuse and trauma I had to endure. Those are the things that taught me to persevere and be triumphant,” he said.
Brown’s trauma has inspired him to give back to families that, like his, have been personally affected by gun violence. After his stepfather was murdered in 2018, he started a nonprofit clothing line called Love1, where he donates proceeds to help cover the funeral costs for victims of gun violence. Love1 has also allowed him to contribute thousands of dollars to the One Gun Gone project, Providence, R.I., based artist Scott Lapham’s effort to combat the gun violence epidemic. One Gun Gone takes guns off the street, creates sculptures out of them, and uses the proceeds to legally purchase more guns to keep them out of illegal markets and off the streets.
After his stepfather’s death, Brown had to juggle his commitments in the classroom and on the football field while trying to effectively grieve. Finding that his teachers were not as supportive as he would have liked them to be, he committed to give back even more and prevent future students from dealing with the same challenges. Recently, he spoke to nearly 10,000 staff members in D.C. Public Schools and launched the Love100 Project, which aims to send 100 DCPS students to therapy to mitigate some of the issues that he faced. Any revenue that he brings in through sales of Love1 clothing goes directly to support this project, in addition to contributing to One Gun Gone.
Brown’s initiatives have already made a big impact on the communities he has sought to uplift. He has been able to pay for funeral costs for some families who otherwise would not be able to afford them, and, in the future, he hopes to be able to pay college tuition for students who have been affected by gun violence. With Love1, he has sought to focus more on the everyday civilians who are often ignored by larger advocacy organizations.
Part of his success in developing Love1 can be attributed to his framing the company through a team-oriented lens. He stresses that, from customers having the funds to buy his clothing to them subsequently trusting him and his team to effectively distribute proceeds, the whole process of making an impact would not be possible without a large group of supporters. He also exudes this humility and grace through his YouTube channel’s “Truth With Ru” series, where he seeks to harness his influence to teach the lessons he has learned throughout his life.
“I decided to start my YouTube channel because I was looking to articulate that people appreciate that I share to a larger audience,” Brown said. “God gave me a gift, that I know how to encourage people, and I’m excited to be able to use that gift, so I look for opportunities like YouTube to share them.”
From his football career to his philanthropic work with Love1 to his Truth With Ru series, Brown has maintained one overarching principle that has helped him bounce back from trauma to become even stronger and more motivated than he was before. This principle has allowed him to develop the patient, process-oriented approach that has kept him grounded. And when asked what one lesson he would teach from his life experience, Brown did not hesitate.
“It would be Love1,” he answered. “And what that means is, simply put, to put love first. And in order to do that, first you need to study love. And studying love is an everyday experience. When you study love, you’ll realize what you need to put first. If I could share anything, if there’s any lesson, if there’s anything about me, it’s one love.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Jacqueline Alemany ’11 wakes up at 4:00 a.m. to go to work each day, one of the first things she does is take a moment to appreciate her “leisurely” morning schedule. After all, patrolling the halls of Congress or writing a daily newsletter can feel, in some respects, relaxed compared to four years of Division I basketball.
“Every time I wake up,” she reflects, “I think to myself how I could be waking up at 4:30 a.m. to make it to 5:00 a.m. lift, and how I’m lucky I’m not doing physical labor at this hour.”
It has been 10 years since Alemany captained the Harvard women’s basketball team, but the habits she built while playing still serve her in her current job. Only now, instead of running down power forwards at Lavietes Pavilion, she is running down power brokers in the U.S. Capitol and reporting on Congress for The Washington Post.
Growing up, Alemany knew she loved to write. And as a self-described “news junkie,” her eventual profession was a natural fit. Throughout high school and college, however, a future in journalism rarely, if ever, crossed her mind. While many of her current colleagues were likely writing for their high school or college newspapers, Alemany dedicated much of her extracurricular time to her team.
“Basketball was really a full-time job for me until I graduated from college,” she recalls.
In high school, she was a two-time All-State selection in New York and won a gold medal at the Empire State Games, a distinction she shares with WNBA legend Sue Bird. At Harvard, the government concentrator was second on the team and cracked the top 10 in the Ivies in rebounds and assists as a junior, but Alemany is most remembered by Head Coach Kathy Delaney-Smith for the character that got her elected captain and set the tenor of her teams.
“Jackie was unique in her ability to laugh at herself, and to not take herself too seriously,” Delaney-Smith said. “Her leadership was far-reaching and not totally defined by basketball.”
Delaney-Smith also recalled Alemany’s ability to quickly build strong relationships with her teammates, a trait that Alemany now finds foundational to her journalistic career. Growing up in the diverse basketball community introduced her to “so many different amazing cultures and backgrounds and people,” giving her a reporter’s curiosity and a window into different perspectives which makes her “better not just as a journalist but as a person.”
But while she was receiving an informal education in the stories of America, turning this training into a profession was not something she had yet considered.
“I had really assumed I was going into finance,” Alemany said.
But upon graduating and starting her first job, Alemany “realized right away that it wasn’t for me.” So she began applying for jobs in the news industry, and, just as rejections and frustration were piling up, she received an offer to join the Page program at CBS.
“I accepted it in less than 30 minutes,” she remembers.
Arriving at CBS, she worked odd hours preparing guests for Anderson Cooper’s now-discontinued syndicated daytime talk show and made a point to “make as many friends as possible.” After working her way up to a job writing for Crimesider, a CBS affiliate that covered the country’s grisliest murders (“I’ll spare you the details,” Alemany reassured), she met her boss, and eventual CBS News President, Susan Zirinsky, who learned of Alemany’s interest in politics and helped connect her with the network’s news wing in Washington, D.C. Alemany eventually got hired to work for Bob Schieffer at “Face the Nation,” a post she calls “the dream job that catapulted me to where I am today.”
Now at The Post, Alemany authors “Power Up,” a newsletter which takes a thorough look at the goings-on of the three branches of government in D.C., and covers stories from Congress. It is a job that, like fitting school around a varsity basketball commitment, requires a tight schedule and efficient work habits. In fact, Alemany came to the interview for this article directly after publishing a last-minute scoop on a letter written by former Biden Campaign staffers criticizing the White House’s response to Israel’s actions in Gaza.
And between the pandemic, ongoing economic woes, and inflammatory foreign conflicts, journalism has become a job whose only certainty is uncertainty, in which a day’s work can be undone by a late development.
“There have been a lot of last-minute, getting a tip at 7:00 p.m. and crashing on it until midnight, then getting back to work at 6:00 a.m. kinds of stories,” she notes.
Securing these tips involves strategies that still feel to Alemany somewhat absurd. After starting her day by calling her reliable sources, “I basically just stalk lawmakers in the halls of Congress,” she jokes.
By situating herself in certain nooks or doorways, she waits for lawmakers or staff to walk by to get their input on the stories of the day. Recently, this meant slipping into an elevator with Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney on the day she was ousted from GOP leadership, collecting a quote before running to catch Republicans on their way out of the room where they voted on Cheney’s future, then “piecing together a story about what happened inside those closed doors.”
With Washington’s partisan competition and political scheming, reporting on Congress can sometimes feel like covering a sports league. But though Alemany sees parallels between her current and former endeavors — from the persistence and discipline needed to push a story forward to the team atmosphere of a newsroom — the former athlete, who says she grew up with “ESPN on in my house at all times,” takes special care to make sure her reporting treats politics with the gravity and thoroughness it requires.
With each story she writes, she works to “steer clear of the horse race political coverage” that can be easy to dwell on.
“One of the reasons I got into journalism was because I was passionate about giving voice to underserved communities and populations,” Alemany said.
Rather than focus on the spectacle of D.C. infighting, she aims to concentrate on what originally called her to the industry.
“I try to make sure I’m telling the stories of voters, and of real people,” Alemany added.
Ten years out from Harvard, Alemany still tries to reconnect with the university as much as possible. Whether moderating a youth polling forum with the IOP or sitting on career panels with the basketball team, Alemany makes a point to encourage youth participation in politics and journalism as much as possible, recognizing how important the alumni network was to her career.
“I’m really grateful for the experience I had,” she reflected. “I hope I can give back.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Harvard announced last summer that only first-years would be allowed back to the College’s campus for the first semester, numerous fall and winter athletes found themselves unexpectedly looking for an alternative avenue to compete.
While Harvard women’s ice hockey junior Keely Moy had already decided that she would not enroll in the fall of 2020, it was not until September that the forward found hers — in Switzerland.
When Harvard emptied its campus last March due to Covid-19, Swiss hockey was not necessarily even on Moy’s radar.
“I was very shocked, just like everyone else,” she said this week. “I wasn't really sure what to do at the time.”
But by September of 2020, with the pandemic worsening in the U.S. and most of Moy’s teammates on the Harvard women’s hockey team taking the academic year off to preserve eligibility, she discovered the possibility of playing in the Swiss Women’s Hockey League.
Within weeks, she booked a plane ticket. By October, she was in Lugano, Switzerland, suiting up for HC Ladies Lugano.
“It was definitely hectic,” Moy said. “ But in my heart, I knew I was going the whole time.”
In taking the leap, Moy joined her brother — former Harvard men’s ice hockey standout Tyler Moy ’17 — who was already playing professionally in Switzerland.
FROM HARVARD TO SWITZERLAND
Underlying the decision to take the leap of faith was the dream to someday appear in the Olympics. As a dual citizen, Keely Moy has the ability to play for the Swiss National Team. However, citizenship is not the only condition required to play on a national team.
“I have to play one season and live in Switzerland for eight months before I can be eligible for any sort of national team,” Keely Moy explained.
Additionally, to complete the eligibility requirements, Keely Moy will have to play into next fall in the SWHL. Because she technically joined Lugano a couple of games into the season, she will complete her first full season by appearing in next year’s first couple of games.
As the Olympic selection process is still underway, fall 2021 will also feature training camps critical to qualify for the team, providing another reason for Keely Moy to return. Effectively, to give herself a chance to be on the Olympic team, Keely Moy had to make the move to Switzerland in the fall of 2020. So while the Swiss roster is yet to be determined, with Moy’s decision to board the 13-hour transatlantic flight, she has certainly kept herself in play.
“I just decided that I was going to take this shot,” Keely Moy said. “Whether or not I make the Olympic team [is] up to the Olympic team, obviously. And I'm still going through that process right now. But [I] just decided to go there [Switzerland].”
Weighing the pros and cons of going to Switzerland, and ultimately deciding to follow her Olympic dream, was not the only hurdle that Keely Moy had to clear before making the transatlantic journey. In order to maintain NCAA eligibility and compete as a senior upon her return, Moy had to secure pre-approval and grapple with a host of regulatory procedures. Per NCAA rules, Keely Moy did not get paid for her play in Lugano this past season. But even so, the pre-approval process was extensive and littered with opportunities to misstep.
“It was a lot of just asking and making sure and double-checking, getting it all in writing, communicating with the league in Switzerland, communicating with my head coach, communicating with the ECAC and NCAA,” Keely Moy said.
“It was a lot more comforting knowing that [Tyler] was there, and that I could go see him and that I could talk to him,” Keely Moy added.
While Tyler Moy’s process did not necessarily involve the same level of bureaucratic and regulatory checkpoints that Keely had to clear, the move to Switzerland still involved a great deal of transition and featured intermediate stops. In his final season at Harvard, during which he notched a 45-point campaign, the Crimson men’s hockey team advanced to the Frozen Four.
In the spring of 2017, immediately after the conclusion of the season, Tyler Moy played in three games for the Milwaukee Admirals, completing his studies remotely — before Covid-19 made doing so the norm. After graduation, Tyler Moy returned to Milwaukee full-time for the 2017-18 season.
In 2018, Moy decided to make the move to Switzerland to play in the National League, where he still plays today, capitalizing on the unique opportunity presented by dual citizenship.
“Switzerland's a highly touted place to be able to play, and they only have room right now for four imports [non-Swiss citizens] on a team to be playing,” Tyler Moy said. “So if you can have Swiss citizenship, you’ve really lucked out. So I put my Swiss citizenship to use.”
After two seasons in Lausanne, Tyler Moy was traded to HC Genève-Servette, where he put up 24 points in 2020-21, his inaugural campaign with the team.
Like his sister, Tyler’s 2020-21 season began with some uncertainty and unexpected change.
“I actually traveled to Switzerland expecting to play for Lausanne,” Tyler Moy said. “My last day of quarantine that I had to do before I was free — because I was coming from the U.S. — [Lausanne] called me and asked me if I was interested in a trade. In Switzerland, everyone has to agree to the trade. So they had an opportunity for me to go to Geneva, which I thought was a good opportunity for me.”
Midway through the season in 2021, Moy signed a two-year extension with the Geneva-based squad.
“I knew we had a good team and we had the capability for success,” Tyler Moy said. “It was a good opportunity for me in Geneva.”
“My development is really important to me,” he added. “I wanted to be somewhere where I was going to be able to grow as a player, grow as a person.”
Still, Moy hopes to find himself on the other side of the Atlantic again in the future.
“Everyone's dream is to play in the NHL,” Tyler Moy said. “I'd like to get that chance one day.”
ADJUSTING TO SWITZERLAND
When the siblings did eventually arrive in Switzerland — albeit at different points — they faced a host of challenges they needed to adapt to, both on and off the ice.
“It's definitely a culture shock,” said Tyler Moy of his arrival in Lausanne. “When I first got there, I felt a little bit out of touch with things that were going on around me.”
Both siblings faced a language barrier, with over 60 percent of the country speaking German, roughly a quarter speaking French, and a smaller minority speaking Italian.
“It was definitely an adjustment,” said Keely Moy, who worked to learn Italian from several Italian and Italian-speaking teammates in Lugano, which is located in the Italian-speaking Canton of Ticino.
Despite potential language barriers, however, within both the men’s and women’s hockey communities, most players speak English. Given the international nature of many hockey rosters, much of the coaching happens in English as well.
Both players also had to make the adjustment to playing on Olympic ice — a surface that is 15 feet wider than National Hockey League and NCAA ranks. The neutral zone on Olympic ice is eight feet longer than in college, and the two defensive zones are both four feet shorter.
“It really changes the game in the sense that there’s so much more skating,” said Tyler Moy of the men’s game in Switzerland. “I feel like I’m a much better skater now because you have to be able to keep up and to be able to play the game.”
“You have a little bit more time with the puck on a bigger ice surface, but you also do a lot more skating, I feel, to be able to get high-quality chances on offense,” he added.
In the women’s game, Keely Moy said the larger ice surface contributed to the game having a different pace than college hockey in the U.S., creating a deliberate brand of hockey that requires players to use all the real estate on the ice.
“It was definitely a big change for me,” she said. “The pace of the game was a lot slower than Division I college. And also, the ice was bigger — that's a contributing factor to why the game is slower. You have a lot more time to think.”
Keely Moy added that three years in D-I left her well-prepared for the Swiss game.
“I definitely think that I was well-prepared at Harvard — not only just on-ice, and being able to keep up and being able to do well, but just [in] mental preparation,” she said.
“[Strength and Conditioning Coach James Frazier] was a big factor in how I prepare for the game — how I cool down from the game, how I see the game," she added. "And the types of things that I'm looking for on the ice — a big factor in that was Harvard hockey. So I'm really thankful for it because we treat it like a professional organization.”
PLAYING WITH A HEAVY HEART
As Keely trains for a potential Olympic bid and Tyler continues his professional career, they both continue to draw inspiration from their father, Randy Moy. As a college student, the eldest Moy played hockey at Western Michigan University in the 1970s. His love for the game continued for the rest of his life as he helped grow the sport in San Diego, Calif., the Moy siblings’ hometown.
“I grew up in San Diego — not really known to be a hockey hotbed, or at least it wasn't really known to be so in the past. My dad played a huge, instrumental part in building up San Diego hockey,” Tyler Moy said.
Over the summer, Randy Moy passed away from cancer, and his legacy has inspired the Moy siblings to take on the challenges of the last year. For Keely, the summer served as an inflection point in her attitude towards taking chances when they present themselves.
“That [last summer] really opened up my eyes to start doing the things that I wanted to do and to continue to chase my dreams,” Keely Moy said. “As hard as that was for me, it was really eye-opening and important for me to go after what I wanted to do.”
By presenting the opportunity to live and play in the same country, 2020’s challenges also provided a unique opportunity for the Moy siblings to find solace in one another.
“With my dad's passing, we've definitely had to become closer. It was definitely harder to be alone,” Keely Moy said.
“It was a very difficult time for us to transition back to living normal lives,” Tyler Moy reflected. “Feeling that void was very difficult. And you put that together with being in a foreign country by yourself — it was nice to have somebody that you could maybe relate to in terms of the experience that you're going through.”

In the Crimson Sports Comp, soon-to-be staff writers are taught not to write strictly in chronological order. Game stories should not flow from the first to fourth quarter by rule, a comp director would explain in the Sanctum to a dwindling number of compers on a Sunday afternoon, but rather hook the reader early with the most important part of the contest. As my time with The Crimson comes to an end sitting at home rather than celebrating on campus, and I clear out my email that I will no longer be reachable at, I can’t help but follow this hallowed commandment one last time and reflect on the beginning.
My beginnings could not have been more lucky thanks to the crop of editors above me on the Crimson Sports Board. The Brain Trust that preceded me welcomed us with open arms, with chairs Sam Danello and Stephen Gleason leading our Board faithfully, and Jack Stockless and Troy Bocelli guiding me through the comp as I adjusted to college. I owe my entire Crimson career to this class of leaders, pillars of excellence to be emulated at every step, both in and out of the press box. As we sat on the floor of Gleason’s house outside Philly at two in the morning, Troy live-edited my story covering the Ivy League Basketball Tournament on-site. I felt this mentorship just as much months before at knockoff China King, when Troy urged me, “DON’T drink that” as he passed a self-made cocktail of contents with ambitious ratios to me along the table’s lazy susan.
That’s not to say my reporting career didn’t have its own flashes of greatness. Amir Mamdani and I put together an electric dynamic duo covering women’s basketball our freshman year, reveling in the greatness of KDS and her postgame comments. I founded the Katie Benzan Fan Club and had some trouble adjusting from impassioned fan to impartial reporter, with Amir and I completely invested in our beat not just to write, but to root for as well.
I would trade the court for the gridiron, reporting with Cade Palmer and James “Ulysses” Joyce on the football team, where the Special Teams Fan Club was born. Our speedy team had a penchant for publishing right away, whether we were writing thousands of words about punters, or some other stuff.
Soon enough, I found myself a part of leadership, guiding an enormous contingent of compers with my partner Henry Zhu. We declared ourselves recruiting geniuses as we grew the next generation of sports writers who are still taking the building by storm. While this class was truly impressive, our greatest achievement was perhaps the invention of Sports Formal Fashion for important Crimson events. While it has yet to take over the Patagonia vests of Silicon Valley, our innovative fashion transformed the fancy social events of The Crimson. I hope that decades from now, when the rest of the building makes up a sea of suits and dresses, our Board continues to show up fashionably late donning their favorite jerseys.
Even when I became chair, it was the people that made every experience worth it. Henry served as my better half during my first go as chair, as he was truly the steady hand that guided the ship. When Will Boggs took over for Henry and I continued on, he filled in Henry’s role through a pandemic despite any “ veteran experience” that I may have had.
These duties weren’t always the most important moments. I remember singing Dancing Queen in Gleason’s massive Currier suite just as well as I remember trying to swipe swag while reporting from opposing stadiums to decorate the Cube. I furiously typed away in Columbia’s press box to beat the traffic home, but I also furiously tore through scal pals while resident life-of-the-party Spencer Morris dapped up our favorite Kong server.
Even so, it wasn’t always sunshine and roses. The minuscule social budget was often depleted much too early into the semester, calling for all-important personal donations. I was personally responsible for the battery of Spencer’s Adams suite that graciously hosted us many a time. We were called into the President’s office more times than we would’ve liked, sometimes for business, oftentimes for Sports Board shenanigans. Nevertheless, we usually left the meetings with the same result as the one given to us by the Massachusetts State Police Officer that pulled over the football contingent on our way home from a long day of reporting at Princeton: a warning.
What is the true point of all of these stories from my storied Crimson Sports career? Perhaps it’s that the people of the Board are what truly make it great. Sure, we’ve won some awards and done some great reporting, but the companionship of my fellow editors will live on forever. The Crimson may have a rule to never remove articles, but the memories my friends and I made are even more permanent. After page is completed and a closeout is written, the more straws in your scorpion bowl, the better.
To be honest, I didn’t have an overarching point in mind while writing my last hurrah. After all, I’ve used my platform in a questionable fashion throughout my tenure, and I see no reason to change that now. Through countless columns, I’ve simply written down exactly what I’ve thought. When I think about my Sports Board tenure, all I can think — despite its tragic ending — is that we had a whole lot of fun. Probably the same thoughts shared by the Brown football team at the end of yet another loss. Consider that unprovoked yet characteristic attack my true parting shot.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Happening just once every four years, the World Cup is the pinnacle event for women’s rugby competitors worldwide. In hopes of being crowned the best in the world, each country selects the best women’s rugby players it has to offer.
In February of 2021, it was announced that five women’s rugby players from Harvard, both current members and alumni, are in a pool of 51 players in contention to make the World Cup 15s roster, which will eventually be whittled down to around 30 athletes.
USA Rugby recruits star players by scouting the Women’s Premier League (WPL), which is the top rugby league in the U.S., keeping tabs on high-level collegiate players, and holding recruitment camps.
The next edition of the World Cup is going to be in New Zealand. It was scheduled to take place in the fall of 2021.
However, Covid-19 had other ideas.
Postponed for over a year from now, in the fall of 2022, New Zealand will resume its role as host of the World Cup. Hoping to be included on the coveted final U.S. roster are current and former Harvard rugby standouts Shelby Lin ’14, Maya Learned ’18, Jenny Kronish ’19, Erica Jarrell ’21, and Cassidy Bargell ’22.
DIFFERENT PATHS, SAME DESTINATION
Rugby is a relatively new sport to the U.S. and to Harvard as well. In fact, in 1982, women’s rugby, then under the Radcliffe College name, was founded at Harvard. The Crimson squad eventually graduated to varsity status in the 2013-14 season. Lin ’14 was a senior at Harvard when the shift took place and is now one of the leading contenders to make the final USA roster.
Lin grew up as a competitive soccer player up until the end of high school. She was then faced with a difficult choice: become a Division III soccer player or attend Harvard, but not as a member of the varsity soccer program. Ultimately, she chose Harvard.
Left with an incredible athletic drive and no team to play on, Lin sought out a new athletic program to throw herself into. She had heard about rugby before, and she was intrigued.
“I sought out rugby because I’d always love touch football,” the former Adams House resident said. “It seemed fun.”
The scrum-half began her rugby career as a first-year, and by the end of it, her team had won the Division II National Club Championship. Needless to say, she was hooked.
The transition from soccer to rugby that Lin made is not a foreign one to Kronish ’19 either. Also from New York State, Kronish was recruited to Harvard as a soccer player. Upon falling ill after her first year right after the soccer preseason ended, Kronish, who had been playing soccer from an early age, soon came to realize that her athletic passions had begun to shift. Just like Lin, Kronish found rugby and made the squad as a walk-on.
The former Kirkland House member noted that the transition was easier than she expected. Not only had she played a varsity sport for a year before she transitioned to rugby, but she also had some great teammates in the rugby program to come to.
“Everyone was super welcoming,” Kronish said. “The fact that you can come in as a walk-on and immediately make an impact is pretty special.”
Being a walk-on and rising through the ranks is something that current Harvard women’s rugby co-captain Erica Jarrell ’21 knows all too well. After growing up as a rising equestrian star, Jarrell too was left without a sport when she got to Harvard.
Growing up with a Division I wrestler for a brother, Jarrell was raised playing baseball and roughhousing with her brother. Once the Lincoln, Mass., native got on campus, she received an email from a rugby recruiter entitled, “Are you a badass?”
If you have had any interaction with Jarrell before, then you know the answer to that question is yes. Jarrell went to the recruitment meeting, saw the physicality of the sport, and fell in love.
WOMEN OF MANY TALENTS
Although all five rugby stars excel on the field, they have found a way to be successful in many ways off the field as well.
After graduating in just three academic years studying applied math, Lin went on to become employed at world-renowned Mckinsey & Company while pursuing her rugby dreams. The East Setauket, N.Y., native also joined the Berkeley All Blues, a member of the WPL.
And Lin is not the only one with an impressive off-the-field resume. Bargell, an integrative biology concentrator with a secondary in government, has been working on a project with a Harvard professor focused on analyzing voter segregation in different areas in the U.S.
A concentrator in molecular and chemical biology with a secondary in psychology, Jarrell is currently conducting research for her thesis and, on top of playing rugby with some of the best in the world, is planning to attend medical school.
A medical scribe before Covid-19 hit, Learned ’18, also a player in the WPL, is planning on becoming a doctor one day herself as well.
SACRIFICE, SACRIFICE, SACRIFICE 
Being one of the most prominent women's rugby players in the U.S. does not come without its challenges. These elite athletes have to make large sacrifices in order to continue to play the sport they love at the highest level possible.
Learned turned down three job offers in order to be available to play in the World Cup in 2021. That is until it got postponed until 2022.
The theme of making sacrifices for the sport they love is not unique to Learned. Jarell took a semester off of school in order to train, to be able to participate in the required camps before the World Cup, and to be ready if she were to have made the final roster for the original World Cup date of fall of 2021.
In the spring, all five current and former Harvard women’s rugby players attended a Daily Training Environment training camp in order to participate in intense training and to be further evaluated. All five competitors moved to Denver, Colo., for seven weeks and fought for a spot on the World Cup roster, leaving behind family and friends, school, and sometimes jobs.
MAKING THE BEST OF A TOUGH SITUATION
Covid-19 has impacted many realms of life, and elite women’s rugby was not spared. Besides the postponement of the World Cup, leaving many of these phenomenal athletes without day jobs, these rugby stars have had to get creative in their training strategies as well.
In the DTEs, there was an entry process the athletes had to go through in order to enter the training bubble. Once they got in, the rugby standouts had to wear masks in the gym and train in pods of eight in the fall and in pods of 16 in the spring in order to protect the group from potential outbreaks. This was followed by a barrage of Covid-19 tests and extensive workout equipment cleaning after usage.
The adjustments in their training due to Covid-19 did not stop there. Without a formal match to play in or a team to be on, many of the athletes were left to their own creativity to find a way to train. A lot of them found rugby players in the area to train with, run with, and even work out in garage gyms with.
In fact, for the young phenoms and current Harvard co-captains Jarrell and Bargell, Covid-19 has even had some surprising benefits. Bargell took online classes this year, which gave her the ability to train in the DTEs in both the fall and spring, potentially giving her a better chance of making the final World Cup roster for Team USA.
Jarrell pointed out that she has excelled in the tryout camps because she was physically fitter than her competitors who may have struggled in finding ways to train.
“I really took this time, in a rugby sense, to go back to basics and clean up some stuff that I didn’t have time to fix because I was busy training for the next game,” Jarrell said.
IT’S BIGGER THAN THEM
For many of these rugby standouts who have dedicated so much time and energy to the sport they love, making the final World Cup roster for Team USA would mean so much more than just another accomplishment in their already impressive rugby careers.
“It’s become bigger than my own experience with 80 minutes a time on the field,” Jarrell said. “The World Cup would be my carrying all of these people that I’ve connected to because of the sport with me.”
Kronish resonates with Jarrell’s sentiments as well.
“I feel like I’ve had a lot of people in my corner,” Kronish said. “It would be a privilege to represent myself and all of them in the USA jersey.”
But even more so than representing themselves and those who have helped them along the way, these five amazing athletes will be representing Harvard, an emerging powerhouse in the rugby world thanks largely to these individuals.
“Harvard kind of snuck up on everyone,” Kronish said. “I believe that all of us are really dedicated to improving ourselves for the betterment of the team and finding ways to learn and improve on and off the field to help the team, which were definitely values that were instilled at Harvard.”
“It [Harvard’s five representatives currently in the running for the final World Cup roster] speaks a lot to the program we’ve built,” Learned added.
A program that began its varsity athletic status with Lin in 2013-14, who may soon suit up with Harvard’s rising stars, appears to be bound for future excellence.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Of the top 50 female athletes in professional squash, three are former Crimson stars. Amanda Sobhy ’15, Haley Mendez ’15, and Sabrina Sobhy ’19, ranked fifth, 42nd, and 20th respectively, all played as members of Harvard’s elite squash team before pursuing full-time careers on the Professional Squash Association World Tour.
Although the three former Crimson athletes have all found immense success on the pro circuit, they have taken different paths to reach that success.
From the beginning of her time at Harvard, Amanda Sobhy knew that she wanted to pursue a career in professional squash. She strove to balance her ambition to play pro squash with her desire for a quality college education.
“I always knew I wanted to be a full-time pro after graduating Harvard,” wrote Amanda Sobhy in an email to The Crimson. “When I first started Harvard in 2011, there was still a stigma around being a college athlete and not taking your pro career seriously. A lot of people thought that, because I chose the college route instead of going full time on the pro tour at 18, then my squash was going to drop, and I wouldn't improve.”
“Of course, I wanted to prove those people wrong and show that you can get a great education and still be able to improve your squash and do well on the pro tour after graduating,” Amanda Sobhy added.
On the other hand, Mendez and Sabrina Sobhy did not decide to pursue professional squash full time until the later years of their time at Harvard. Mendez, who was a pre-med student at Harvard, originally planned to play on the PSA World Tour for one or two years before attending medical school. However, while rehabbing a torn ACL during her senior spring, she realized she wanted to make a career out of squash instead of medicine.
“I initially thought that I would sort of only play for a couple of years and then go to medical school,” Mendez said. “[Tearing my ACL] sort of derailed all my plans to go pro straight away. And I ended up spending a year full-time rehabbing before I could join the tour. And then, in that time, I sort of decided I didn't love medicine as much as I thought I should to go to medical school. So even though I had finished pre-med, and I took the MCAT, I decided to let that expire and keep playing squash.”
Similar to Mendez, Sabrina Sobhy was fairly certain that she would not pursue a full-time career in squash until her senior year at Harvard. According to Sabrina Sobhy, she was a bit worn out from squash heading into college. However, she rediscovered her love for the sport while playing on the Harvard women’s squad.
“I was pretty much dead set on not going pro because I think, going into college, I was burnt out of squash,” Sabrina Sobhy said. “And then, throughout my time at school, I definitely shifted much more towards more enjoyment. The love for the game was reignited inside of me, [by] Harvard squash and my wonderful teammates and the community there.”
“But it probably wasn't until the beginning of my senior year where I kind of was like, ‘Alright, well, you’ve got to start thinking about what you want to do after college.’ And I wasn't entirely ready to stop squash,” Sabrina Sobhy added.
As the three former Crimson athletes have embarked on their journeys on the PSA World Tour, they have found adjusting to life as a pro athlete thrilling, tiring, and everything in between. According to Sabrina Sobhy, when she made her first foray into full-time squash, the physically demanding lifestyle and lack of teammates for support caught her by surprise.
“Something that surprised me tremendously was just kind of the exhaustion of traveling every few weeks, on top of training,” Sabrina Sobhy said. “And then, of course, [at Harvard] you had your team there to kind of bring the energy and bring the support and give you a really positive reason for performing and competing, which the pro life doesn't have.”
However, Sabrina Sobhy credits the difficulty of this transition with helping her discover the importance of staying motivated, even if the motivation had to come from within.
“No matter how exhausted you are, from traveling, training, whatever it is, you're your sole motivator,” Sabrina Sobhy said. “It was a bit eye-opening just to kind of figure out that true sense of motivation and reasoning behind competing and traveling — in the beginning, for me, at least.”
Mendez also found the transition to full-time pro squash to be intensely demanding physically but enjoys the rigor and fast-paced lifestyle of being a pro athlete.
“I traveled quite a bit as a junior and then obviously trained as much as I could at Harvard,” Mendez said. “But it definitely took me sort of a couple of years to get adjusted to life as a full-time pro and what it entails. But it's super, super exciting. I get to travel the world to play squash and call it my job. So I count myself lucky.”
Like many athletes, professional squash players were hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic, with access to squash courts and workout equipment heavily restricted during the initial outbreak last March. However, Amanda Sobhy, Mendez, and Sabrina Sobhy all found ways of staying motivated and keeping themselves busy during this turbulent period. The Sobhy sisters, who did not have access to a squash court, tackled endeavors that complemented their squash play, such as virtual squash instruction and other forms of exercise.
“I actually took some time off during the pandemic and didn't play squash for about two months. I still worked out, but I wanted to work on other things that would complement my squash without having me on a squash court,” Amanda Sobhy wrote. “I also was doing a ton of virtual teaching for junior squash kids and also Squash & Education Alliance, which kept me engaged in the community and super busy.”
“I was able to practice other forms of exercise and mental training,” Sabrina Sobhy said. “Most of the time, I'm just practicing squash, but I was able to go for more leisurely runs and other forms of exercise like [virtual] Pilates or yoga. But it was nice to kind of get in touch with the other athletic abilities that I enjoy.”
Mendez, who fortunately had access to a squash court during quarantine but no one to play with, focused on solo practice and improvised by having her family members help her out with training.
“I was lucky — I always had access to a squash court,” Mendez said. “But I didn't necessarily have people to play with for long periods. So it was a lot of solo practice, or, I would have my dad or my sister, who are not squash players, throw balls up for me with their hands.”
It comes as little surprise that Harvard’s women’s team has produced three players currently in the top 50. The team has won six straight national championships, a streak that dates back to the final year of Amanda Sobhy and Mendez’s time at Harvard. Perhaps another athlete from the star-studded Crimson squad will join them in the top 50 sooner rather than later.
Note: At the time of writing, Amanda Sobhy (world ranking: 5) and Haley Mendez (world ranking: 42) are competing at the El Gouna Open in Egypt. Their rankings are subject to change as the season progresses.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 14 months have passed since a Harvard Athletics program last competed. With Ivy League presidents announcing the cancellation of fall 2020, winter 2020-2021, and spring 2021 sports seasons due to Covid-19, the Crimson's 42 varsity teams have largely trained and communicated away from campus during the last academic year.
Given the absence of intercollegiate competition, Harvard's student-athletes faced important considerations when deciding whether or not to enroll in classes in 2020-2021. Other NCAA conferences may allow players that take classes but sit out athletic seasons to avoid counting that season towards their limited eligibility, thus preserving a season of athletic eligibility to use as a graduate student or fifth-year undergraduate. This process is known as “redshirting.”
The Ivy League does not allow redshirting, at least in the traditional sense (a note of clarification on this point to follow). Under Ivy League rules, if a student-athlete does enroll during a sports season, that student-athlete will use the year of eligibility, whether or not the individual plays in any games or not. Thus, to preserve eligibility in a season with no games or competitions, which became the new normal during the Covid-19 pandemic, deferring enrollment for a semester or a full year becomes a very viable option for many student-athletes. While the Ivy League did grant a one-time waiver in February 2021 for its seniors to compete as graduate students, for many Crimson student-athletes graduating this spring, the decision arrived too late to impact their post-graduate plans.
Without the ability to compete this year, did Crimson student-athletes decide to preserve a year of eligibility by not enrolling in classes? Or did student-athletes seeking access to Harvard's athletic facilities, which was limited to those enrolled and living on-campus, choose to enroll? How does the rate of student-athletes deferring enrollment this year compare to that of the College as a whole?
METHODOLOGY
To find the rate of Harvard student-athletes taking time off from classes, or a "gap semester," in fall 2020 and spring 2021, The Crimson created a data set of all Harvard student-athletes listed on rosters during the 2019-2020 academic year. Thus, class of 2024 student-athletes who first enrolled in the fall of 2020 are not included in this data set. These rosters are listed on the official Harvard Athletic Department website, GoCrimson.com, and have been confirmed by the Crimson's Sports Information Directors to accurately list every student-athlete that is enrolled in classes. For example, during fall 2020 GoCrimson rosters listed every student-athlete that was currently enrolled in classes for the fall 2020 semester.
The Crimson then searched for first-year (original class of 2023), sophomore (2022), and junior (2021) student-athletes in the 2019-2020 data set to appear again on 2020-2021 GoCrimson rosters. In some cases, Harvard Athletics rosters from 2019-2020 also list student-athletes as “redshirts” as an additional category beyond the four class years. Although The Crimson was unable to clarify why some Harvard Athletics rosters used the term “redshirt” given the Ivy League’s unique policies on academic enrollment and athletic eligibility, to be consistent with terms used on 2019-2020 GoCrimson rosters, the term “redshirt” is included in the data set. If names from 2019-2020 were missing on 2020-2021 rosters, The Crimson confirmed through the Harvard College Facebook and internet searches that these student-athletes were taking time off from classes during fall 2020, spring 2021, or both.
In the results below, the rate of student-athletes taking a gap semester is categorized by gender, sports team, class year, and season. For programs that compete in two seasons, the sport is included in both seasonal categories. Track and field, for example, is counted as both a winter and spring sport.
RESULTS
Before comparing the rate of Harvard student-athletes taking gap semesters across different sports teams, genders, and class years in 2020-2021, the aggregate finding of this study is that, out of the entire population of Crimson student-athletes, approximately 40 percent opted to take time off from classes during each of the fall 2020 and spring 2021 semesters.
This rate is roughly twice that of College undergraduates at large (student-athletes and non-athletes alike) who opted for time off from classes in 2020-2021. According to College officials, 5,382 students and 5,177 students enrolled in classes for the fall 2020 and spring 2021 semesters, respectively. Given that 6,755 undergraduates enrolled during the 2019-2020 academic year, the total enrollment of the College’s student body in 2020-2021 decreased by roughly 1,400 students, or 20 percent.
While the data suggests that in each of the fall 2020 and spring 2021 semesters approximately one in five College students took a gap semester, it is important to note that these numbers represent all Harvard College undergraduates — including student-athletes. If student-athletes were extracted from the College-wide totals, an even larger difference would likely be found between the rate of student-athletes that took a gap semester and that rate in non-student athletes. The Crimson’s study does not account for statistical significance; however, there exists considerable evidence that Crimson student-athletes enrolled in classes during the 2020-2021 year at much lower rates than the College’s entire student body.
In turning to deeper analysis and comparison of gap semester rates in 2020-2021, The Crimson first found the difference in enrollment between men’s and women’s sports teams. During the fall 2020 semester, 37 percent of female student-athletes and 43 percent of male student-athletes took the semester off. Furthermore, 41 percent of student-athletes playing a fall sport, 41 percent of those playing a winter sport, and 43 percent of those playing a spring sport took time off in the fall.
In the spring 2021 semester, the number of female athletes who took time off increased slightly, while the number of male athletes who took time off decreased slightly: 43 percent of female athletes and 41 percent of male athletes did not enroll in classes. The number of fall athletes taking time off decreased slightly, to 38 percent; on the other hand, the number of winter and spring athletes taking time off increased slightly, to 43 percent and 47 percent respectively.
Women’s ice hockey had the highest percentage of its team take time off in both semesters, with 95 percent of the team taking time off in the fall and 90 percent taking time off in the spring. On the other hand, none of the players on the men’s basketball and women’s tennis teams took time off in either term.
While many teams had similar gap-semester rates across fall 2020 and spring 2021, a number of teams also had significant differences between the semesters. Student-athletes on the football and women’s soccer teams — both fall sports — took time off in spring 2021 at a much lower rate than fall 2020. For football, the rate of players who took time off in the spring compared to the fall decreased by 23 percentage points; similarly, women’s soccer saw a 26-point decrease. Conversely, a number of spring sports had higher rates of players taking time off in the spring than the fall, such as baseball (20 percentage points higher), softball (19 points), and women’s water polo (18 points). Notably, baseball, softball, and women’s water polo seasons take place primarily in the spring.
Across class years, 2019-2020 sophomores (original class of 2022) decided to take time off at a higher rate than first-years (2023) or juniors (2021). In fall 2020 and spring 2021, sophomores enrolled at a rate of only 52 and 51 percent, respectively. While 64 percent of 2019-20 freshmen enrolled in fall 2020, the rate decreased to 59 percent in spring 2021. On the other hand, 2019-20 juniors’ enrollment rate increased from 58 percent in the fall to 62 percent in the spring.
SURVEY
In addition to the study on the rate of student-athletes taking time off during 2020-2021, The Crimson asked senior student-athletes, “How did you approach your senior season and questions about eligibility?” The survey, administered via email exclusively to senior student-athletes, garnered 69 responses. Twenty-nine percent of respondents indicated that they had already played their final season of intercollegiate athletics in the 2019-2020 school year. Forty percent of respondents indicated they chose to take time off in order to maintain their eligibility for another season; of these student-athletes, 27 percent indicated they would take an entire school year off, while the remaining 13 percent indicated they would only take a single semester off of classes. Another 20 percent of respondents answered that they would transfer as a graduate student to another academic institution in order to maintain their eligibility for another season and compete at that other institution.
Finally, 10 percent of respondents — seven people — chose “other” as a response and wrote in an answer. While some of the senior athletes that chose “other” actually explained their decisions in ways that fit the descriptions of possible survey responses, The Crimson decided to not alter the response data by placing “other” responses in a potentially more appropriate category after administering the survey.
The Ivy League’s initial refusal of an additional year of eligibility for senior student-athletes, coupled with their subsequent reversal of that policy, has incited mixed reactions from those affected by the policy.
Matt Thomas ’21, captain of the baseball team and co-president of the Student-Athlete Advisory Committee (SAAC), will be attending the Harvard Graduate School of Education this coming fall. Although he said he is thankful for the opportunity to potentially play another season of baseball, he acknowledged that the timing of the announcement made it difficult for student-athletes to take advantage of its implications.
“The decision came out really late, to the point where most people had already settled on what their plans were for the next year,” Thomas said. “The timing [of the decision] is unfortunate. I do appreciate the Ivy League; they have never made this exception before. Even though they were willing to compromise there, it shows they were trying to work with the athletes, which I think was appreciated. Though, of course, earlier would have been much better.”
Echoing a similar level of ambivalent understanding, women’s rugby captain Milan Roberts ’21 spoke on the Ivy League’s decision to cancel all sports.
“Initially, I was pretty upset that I didn’t get to compete with my teammates again,” Roberts said. “But I think especially for a sport like rugby that is extremely high contact, I had lowered my expectations of anything happening in the next year or so having anything to do with rugby, because, you know, your face is next to someone’s face or you’re grabbing someone else’s leg every other second, so I didn’t expect there to be a workaround for rugby season that would be Covid-friendly or Covid-safe.”
LASTING CONSEQUENCES 
While potential consequences for Harvard athletics and Ivy League sports as a whole are still largely unknown, athletes are confident in a swift return to competing at the highest collegiate level within the conference and throughout the country.
“We took [the pandemic] in stride, and we’re looking forward, not looking back,” said Roberts while reflecting on the past year.
This forward-looking mindset is needed in what many have called a lost year for Ivy League sports. It is easy to ask the question of what could have been. Many teams — like Roberts’s rugby team who were looking to repeat as national champions this year — will have to live with the fact that they will never get this year back. Yet, as Roberts and others have noted, this year also provided ample opportunities to grow individually and as a team.
“I think that no member of the Harvard baseball team will ever take another game for granted, realizing how much of their careers they’ve already lost,” Thomas said. “So every game they have left, I think they will be able to appreciate. I hope that people see that perspective by realizing how much of a privilege it is to play on the team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For Margaret “Midge” Purce '17, scoring 42 goals in her four seasons with the Harvard women's soccer program was not enough. As she competes in her fifth professional soccer season, fulfills her first term on the Harvard Board of Overseers, and prepares for the 2021 Tokyo Olympics as a member of the United States Women's National Team, Purce continues to set and achieve new goals on and off the field.
Even before enrolling at Harvard as a first-year in 2013, Purce prioritized both academic and athletic opportunities in her recruiting process. In high school, she starred as a member of the U.S. Soccer Under-17 Women's National Team and won Gatorade Girls Soccer Player of the Year in her home state of Maryland. While her incredible speed and quickness on the pitch opened the door for a chance to play at perennial contenders for the NCAA national championship, Purce's passion for academics led her to choose the Crimson for her collegiate career.
After joining a Harvard women's soccer program that had finished just fourth-place in the Ivy League in 2012, Purce's dynamic rookie season energized and improved the team in 2013. She led the Crimson to a 12-4-2 overall record, including an undefeated record in conference play. Purce's remarkable first year earned her Ivy League Rookie of the Year and Ivy League Player of the Year, becoming the first women's soccer player in Ivy League history to win both awards in the same season.
“What made her so unique, it wasn't just about her, it was about what she could bring to the team and how she could help us achieve our goals," said Harvard women's soccer head coach Chris Hamblin. “She was a forward by nature, a goal-scorer. And there were teams that designed systems to stop her. So we moved her around, and she was comfortable with that, knowing it was what's best for the team.”
As Purce progressed through her four seasons at Harvard, her fierce work ethic and drive to improve her skills never wavered. She worked tirelessly to improve her crossing, finishing, ball control in tight spaces, and other technical aspects of her game.
In addition to her development as a player, Midge thrived in her time at Harvard due to her first-class intangible skills, such as personality and leadership. Purce elevated her teammates' play by bringing intensity to each practice, working beyond what the coaching staff had asked, and never hesitating to encourage her teammates to do the same. While she led by example and through verbal communication, it was the fun, light-hearted side of Purce's personality that allowed her and the women's soccer program to be successful.
"It's that balance of intensity and ability to not take life too seriously that I think a lot of high-profile athletes can harness and be able to flip the switch when it's time to go, and then be able to relax and laugh about it afterwards,” Hamblin said. "In regards to leadership […] she was so much fun, so much energy that, if you're having a bad day, it's tough to not enjoy being around her because of the energy she brought every single day."
In Purce's 2016 senior season, her polished ball skills and more consistently elite play earned her yet another Ivy League Player of the Year award and a first-team All-America selection. Through her four seasons at Harvard, Midge and her 2017 classmates led the Crimson to a 22-2-4 Ancient Eight record and won three Ivy League titles.
The development of Midge Purce as a person and player at Harvard was emblematic of the Crimson women's soccer program's core philosophy. Rather than focusing solely on how his student-athletes should improve on the field, Hamblin stresses that important character skills, such as resilience, determination, and empathy, are essential to improving his players' performance and his program's success. When Hamblin ascended to the head coaching position in 2016 — Midge’s last season in Cambridge — he appreciated having such a determined, fun, hard-working senior lead his team in Purce.
"I think there [are] times as a coach where you use sport as a vehicle to really talk about some ways that you can deal with challenge and adversity," Hamblin said. "Sports can provide the adversity and challenge through which people can grow. I know with Midge that during her time in college she did work a lot on becoming better with her consistency mentally and not being frustrated."
After her four years at Harvard, Purce was selected ninth overall by the Boston Breakers in the 2017 National Women's Soccer League draft. In the NWSL, she has spent one season in Boston (2017), two seasons with the Portland Thorns (2018 and 2019), and the last two seasons with the New Jersey/New York Gotham FC (2020 and 2021). Purce enjoyed success at the professional level from the forward position, having recently been named NWSL Player of the Week for the first week of the 2021 season.
From her stellar play in college and the NWSL, Purce earned a call up to the U.S. Women's National Team from head coach Vlatko Andonovski, becoming the first Harvard women’s soccer player to compete for the team. After first appearing in a USWNT match in November 2019, she has been called up five more times and recorded one goal. Purce’s ability to adjust from her traditional, offensive position of forward to the defensive position of right-back speaks to her superb work ethic, character, and talent. The flexibility in Purce’s game has proven critical to her ability to excel at the professional and international levels.
"I think it goes to show the depth of her talent," Hamblin said. "I think what Midge has been working on her whole career is being able to be effective in many different ways. [...] It’s really a tribute to the work that she's put in to develop her game that she can play the highest level at multiple positions."
While Purce has achieved many of her goals on the pitch since graduating from Harvard, her intangible strengths in leadership, personality, and determination have allowed her to flourish outside of soccer as well. In August 2020, Purce was elected to a six-year term on the Harvard Board of Overseers, the second-highest governing board at the university. She has also founded the Black Women’s Player Collective, a nonprofit organization that strives to improve opportunities for Black girls on and off the playing field. In March 2021, Purce was invited to Congress and the White House to speak with teammate Megan Rapinoe about equal pay for women.
“She's been able to use her success as an athlete as a platform for so many important causes,” Hamblin said. “She's able to navigate difficult questions and put herself in a position where she can represent the league, the sport, and Harvard in such a meaningful way."
Even as she meets the President and First Lady, inspires a generation of young soccer players, and dons her country’s letters across her uniform, Purce remains closely connected to the institution that once cultivated her talent, harnessed her drive, and provided opportunities for her to set and accomplish her goals. She regularly helps lead Harvard women’s soccer camps, visits campus, and stays in close contact with Coach Hamblin.
“I joked with her after she was in the White House, 'Hey, 30 years' time, Midge, get yourself ready because you may be back there,’” Hamblin said. “With Midge Purce, you legitimately may have gone to school with the next president. She's going to make a difference in our world, there's no doubt about it. I am really proud of her and privileged to continue to support her."

Harvard professors are known for their cutting-edge research—and also for their effervescent and eccentric personalities. The Veritas Lab, hosted by Katelyn X. Li and Sanjana L. Narayanan, gives you a glimpse of both. Through lively conversations with professors across Harvard, we get at the truth behind the most exciting issues in modern research. Produced by Amanda Y. Su. Podcast art by Margot Shang. Listen and subscribe on Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts.
Episode 1
Have you ever wondered how that mushy glob of tissue –– producing your every thought, action, and emotion –– is built? In this episode, we sit down with Jeffrey Macklis, a professor in Harvard’s Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology and Center for Brain Science, to tackle gripping questions about how the brain develops and what happens when things go wrong in cases of disease and disorder. Tune in if you’re curious about how sets of genes can orchestrate brain development with remarkable precision, and about the potential to apply this innovative research towards regeneration and repair of the human brain.
Episode 2
The fundamental particles we know and love might actually be made of tiny strings that vibrate like the strings of a guitar. We also might be living in a universe with tenor more physical dimensions, some of them curled up where we can’t see them. These ideas, which are at the core of string theory, may sound extraordinary — but they may also be the key to that holy grail of physics, a theory of everything. In this episode of The Veritas Lab, Cumrun Vafa, a professor in Harvard’s Department of Physics, gives us a fascinating tour of the power and perplexities of string theory. If you’ve ever wanted to imagine what spacetime might look like at scales of 20 orders of magnitude smaller than a proton, take a listen!
Episode 3
Literary studies is suffering from a “crisis of confidence,” according to Harvard English professor Beth Blum, from both within and without. Compared to the concreteness of historical fact and scientific data, the humanities are all too often dismissed as offering no practical value, only art for its own sake. In this episode, we sit down with Professor Blum to push back against that argument. In her thought-provoking book The Self-Help Compulsion, Professor Blum untangles our insatiable craving for utilitarian reading like self-help, and argues that literature — even modernist novels as purely aesthetic as James Joyce’s Ulysses — may offer us just as much practical wisdom, if we only take the trouble to look for it.
Episode 4
Computer algorithms can be a double-edged sword. On the one hand, they have the power to transform our understanding of economic policy and social phenomena — from ride-sharing technology, to election prediction, to YouTube recommender systems, to tax policies. Conversely, algorithms can harbor hidden biases. And since modern machine learning systems are often too complex for humans to understand, we may not even recognize when and how algorithms are discriminating against minority populations. In this episode, Harvard computer science professor David Parkes walks us through his research at the intersection of economics and CS, and explains how to leverage the benefits of algorithms without compromising on fairness.
Episode 5
What are the real causes of instability and conflict in the Middle East? Why did some countries successfully transition to democracies after the Arab Spring uprisings, while other countries remain embroiled in violence? And what’s next for the future of American foreign policy in the region? In this episode of The Veritas Lab, Harvard Government professor Melani Cammett dives into the politics of development and destabilization in the Middle East, addressing these questions and many more. Presented by the Harvard Crimson. Hosted by Katelyn Li and Sanjana Narayanan. Produced by Amanda Su. Podcast art by Margot Shang.
Episode 6
What are the real causes of instability and conflict in the Middle East? Why did some countries successfully transition to democracies after the Arab Spring uprisings, while other countries remain embroiled in violence? And what’s next for the future of American foreign policy in the region? In this episode of The Veritas Lab, Harvard Government professor Melani Cammett dives into the politics of development and destabilization in the Middle East, addressing these questions and many more.
Episode 7
The ongoing pandemic has forced us to take a closer look at the American education system. With many schools shuttering across the country, it has become clear that marginalized communities are less likely to receive safe, in-person education than historically privileged groups. Should schools reopen if it means exacerbating these already wide socioeconomic inequalities? The field of educational ethics — developed by Professor Meira Levinson from the Harvard Graduate School of Education — can help educators and policymakers answer moral quandaries like this one. In this episode of The Veritas Lab, Professor Levinson introduces educational ethics and its potential to remedy long-standing issues of injustice.
Episode 8
Climate change is one of the most pressing issues facing our planet today. But this is not the first time Earth’s weather patterns have undergone cataclysmic disruptions. Just take a look at the global ice ages that occurred millions of years ago. These “Snowball Earths” likely had tremendous consequences: freezing the world over, triggering an upsurge of atmospheric oxygen, and maybe even giving rise to multicellular life. With near-record warming in the Arctic and environmental disasters ravaging the globe, understanding Earth’s geologic past may be crucial to ensuring that our planet even has a future. In this final episode of The Veritas Lab, Harvard geology professor Daniel Schrag discusses the tumultuous history of Earth’s climate and the preliminary steps we should take on the long road to decarbonization.
