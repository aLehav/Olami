After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 2009, it seemed that the eclectic British band Muse had finally settled on a sound. That year’s album, “The Resistance,” was firmly squared in a softer pop-rock aesthetic and signaled a possible radio-friendly resting place for the band of a thousand genres. However, the crunchy guitar riff that opens their latest release, “The 2nd Law,” serves as an aggressive rebuttal: the four rapid-fire notes seem to shout, “We haven’t landed yet.”
This metal-edged riff is just the start of the experimentation on “The 2nd Law.” Throughout this curious new album, the self-described “trashy three-piece” tackles musical styles spanning 40-plus years, from the pantheons of pop, rock, and prog to the digitized world of today and imbues each with its own over-the-top energy. The result is a largely fun but uneven ride that finally shows the limits of Muse’s explorative abilities.
As on pre-”Resistance” releases, the band uses each track on “The Second Law” to channel a different musical style. “Survival,” for instance, is a piano driven rocker a la Queen—a band Muse frequently cites as a favorite—with overblown backing harmonies to match. Indeed, as Matthew Bellamy emphatically belts, “I’ll keep up the pace / And I’ll reveal my strength / To the whole human race / Yes I’m gonna win,” it’s not hard to draw a line to another pedal-powered race that Freddie Mercury sang about 30 years earlier. Bellamy can’t match Mercury’s lyrical prowess, but “Survival” manages to capture the operatic extravagance of one of his heroes.
Other tracks delve into influences less familiar to the group with varying degrees of success. “Follow Me,” while beginning beautifully with Bellamy’s emotionally charged vocals floating over a lake of flowing synths, shifts into an utterly jarring quasi-dubstep chorus that traps Bellamy’s voice in a wash of computer-generated fuzz. However, the dubstep additions are not always invasive. The wobbling bass actually adds a welcome imperfection to the minimalist electro-ballad “Madness,” one of the album’s finer moments. Everything seems placed just so, from the barbershop-quartet-style “ma-ma-ma-ma-madness” to Bellamy’s vocal soaring atop the justly deserved climax.
The band is far less successful in its forays into straight prog-rock. “Supremacy” is an attempt to mash bruising Zeppelin-like riffs with grandiose James Bond orchestration, but the angry rock sections feel abrasive, not exciting, when juxtaposed against the serene hum of the midsection’s snare drums and string pads. Bassist Chris Wolstenholme pens and sings a pair of tracks late in the game, and while they are fine pieces of progressive metal, his admittedly pleasing smooth voice lacks Bellamy’s intense vibrato.
In the end, it is Bellamy’s expressiveness that ties these disparate tracks together. While his performance is technically marvelous throughout, he is most successful when conjuring poignancy and passion, which he does to great effect on “Explorers,” a piano ballad and lament for the dying earth. There is genuine melancholy and even desperation when he sings, “Free me from this world / We don’t belong here / It was a mistake imprisoning our souls.”
“Explorers” is one of the several tracks that attempt to tie the album together thematically. Vague references to the end of the Earth abound, culminating in the two-part overdramatic finale “The 2nd Law,” a shifting soundscape that swells and projects paranoia through a newscast sampled on a loop. “New energy cannot be created and high-grade energy is being destroyed,” reports the processed female voice. The track then launches into demonically robotic dubstep. It is certainly intriguing, but after the shock wears off, the piece runs on fumes for its remainder, devolving into swelling and receding electronics and infinite echoes of the newsreel. It’s too little and too late of an effort to bring the album under one uniting idea.
The second law of thermodynamics explains irreversibility in nature and the inevitability of moving in a definite direction. Muse’s “The 2nd Law,” on the other hand, seems content to wander about the genre continuum. But while it is a mixed bag in terms of content and quality, it never loses its key component: energy. Maybe it’s better that Muse doesn’t settle into one sound, as its unpredictability and experimentation bring excitement to every new release.

On Study Card Day in mid-September, all 1,669 freshmen were required to turn in their study cards to University Hall. In eight hours, students from the Institute of Politics assisted nearly 700 of their peers with voter registration and absentee ballot requests, and we got an opportunity to speak with many of them about why they were voting. We heard things like:
“My country and community are important to me!”
“I love America.”
“I care about the future of the U.S.”
Music to our ears! Yet for every enthusiastic new voter, there was an equally hesitant and confused young person looking for assistance. Some weren’t sure if they had already registered, or where they had registered; others didn’t know how to go about requesting an absentee ballot. Fortunately, these questions are easy to address. The questions that were more difficult to answer were: Where should I register—in my home state, or here in my college state? Will my vote make a difference?
Regardless of where or why students want to register to vote, new technologies are making participation in our political process simple. The IOP has partnered with “TurboVote”—an innovative company offering online voter registration technology and an easy pathway for students to navigate voting paperwork and procedures, especially those looking to vote in their home state by absentee ballot. Registering online is easy—students fill out the required forms online, wait for completed documents to arrive in the mail for signature then return them in provided pre-stamped, pre-addressed envelopes. There are no excuses! The logistical hurdles are easily surmountable.
Even as the registration process becomes more simplified, however, students won’t participate unless they want to. The Institute has been conducting public opinion polling of young adults tracking their interest in and views on politics and public service for 12 years with 21 national polls. Since the IOP’s first poll conducted in April of 2000, a significant re-engagement of young adults in the political process has occurred. According to CNN exit polling, more votes were cast in the last presidential election by people under the age of thirty (18-29 year-olds, commonly referred to as “Millennials”) than those aged 65 years or older. Although seniors are traditionally thought of as one of the most reliable voting populations, it was America’s Millennial generation—the largest generation in U.S. history—who showed up at the ballot box in greater numbers in 2008. The power young people have in elections today is immense, as is their responsibility to impact our country’s future.
IOP students knowledgeably tried to address every question posed during the voter registration event, but had more trouble with a comment we heard from several students who said they did not feel “informed enough” to vote. How could we most concisely convey the importance of America’s young adults taking the time to care about politics and vote? Should we have challenged Harvard freshmen to help further dispel the myth that young people are apathetic, despite the fact that the youth vote has been significantly rising since 2004, and more than doubled during the 2008 primaries? Should we stress how the presidential election can decide the direction of the country and our communities for the next four years? Or emphasize how critical the 2012 elections are to our nation’s future, especially to students and Millennials who will become tomorrow’s leaders?
We believe that it may be most effective to encourage young people to listen to their fellow freshmen who enthusiastically responded when asked why they are voting:
“My country and community is important to me!”
“I love America.”
“I care about the future of the U.S.”
Listen to your classmates! Inform yourself through meaningful dialogue about the election and issues you care about. Pay attention to the candidates and what they believe in and stand for. Take the time to ask your fellow students to do the same. Elections are too important to sit out.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Observant students may have noticed smaller, more sparsely attended classes last week, on Wednesday in particular. That is, of course, assuming they were there at all.
The drop in class attendance was precipitated by the calendar, as we currently find ourselves in the season of Jewish holidays. Jewish students across campus enjoyed services for Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, and many went a day without food. Some even went home to celebrate the holidays with their families.
About 25 percent of Harvard undergraduates profess Jewish beliefs, making the school 14th highest in Jewish population. This means that as much as a quarter of students could find themselves suddenly behind in course material after missing class on a high holy day. For the number of students vexed by this problem, it is unfortunate that Harvard is not more accommodating in this regard.
Harvard is quite obviously a secular institution, so it is in no way obligated to factor religious calendars into the academic one. That said, the University should be more empathetic about religious occasions by working with students who choose to celebrate their faith. Class is invariably held on Yom Kippur, Good Friday, and Ramadan when these events occur during the school year. Students of various traditions would surely appreciate the consideration of the University administration and staff.
In lieu of actually structuring the academic calendar around religious holidays, there are various steps the University could take to make days on which many students are absent for religious reasons less difficult for those involved. Given that a quarter of the population of our school is of the Jewish faith, it does not seem unreasonable for the University to suggest that classes hold an additional section during religious weeks to accommodate affected students. Additionally, it doesn’t seem like it would be an untoward burden on the University to expand the number of courses that it videotapes in order to make these (and other) absences less costly. In fact, Harvard now records many of its lectures for Extension School students. It should extend the same courtesy to the students of the College.
Harvard needs to keep the interests of its student body at heart. This means ensuring that academic life does not put a burden on religious life and vice versa. The school should have a policy of understanding, and the administration should notify professors that some students might need an extra day to complete assignments. Luckily, many professors and teaching fellows are already empathetic when it comes to religious holidays, but the fate of one’s transcript should not rely on whether or not he has a friendly teaching fellow.
All of these things aside, it is important to remember that those who miss classes are not the only ones who lose something when a section is underattended or a seminar lacks a sizable portion of its students—the missing students’ peers are worse for their absence, and Harvard should do everything it can to make these events as rare as possible.
Harvard should be particularly aware of these conflicts when making the administrative calendar for study card day and other such deadlines. In establishing the most efficient system, it does not make sense to force students turn in their study cards when up to a quarter of them may not even be on campus, as has been the case in the past. Harvard knows the demographics of its students better than anyone and it would behoove administrators to use that information for the benefit of all.

The “actual” cause of the Arab civil uprisings became the pet debate of Middle East analysts almost immediately after protests seized the Arab world last January—most likely because that conversation conveniently avoided discussion of why the great majority of academics and pundits denied the possibility of a region-wide revolution in the first place. Now, the rise of political Islam has replaced that subject as analysts’ pet debate. Unfortunately, the character of both debates reflects a myopic, politics-based perspective that overlooks the region’s most prominent threat: an economic winter.
Since 1949, American journalism on the Middle East has tended to concern itself with Israel’s security and, since 1979, political Islam. But these concerns encourage a shortsighted focus on surface-level political developments in the Arab world. With the exception of the Gulf oil market, the region’s economy remains a subject of neglect.
This is not, in fact, a uniquely American or Western phenomenon. In Egypt I discovered that, with the obvious exception of economists, very few Egyptians—including top journalists, academics, activists, and politicians—considered Egypt’s economic struggles outside of a social or political lens. I raised this observation to Amr Moussa, a former Egyptian presidential candidate and former Secretary General of the Arab League, during an interview at his office in Cairo this July. He argued, “This kind of dichotomy [between the elite’s focus on political issues and the economic concerns of most people] certainly exists because the so-called elite are just talking to each other and staying in the same place and reading the same stuff.”
With all due respect to Mr. Moussa, the generation of Arab youth that stormed capitals across the region should not be satisfied with that answer. In a dangerous paradox, Arab leaders are avoiding the subject of economic challenges because of their immensity. The Muslim Brotherhood, of which Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi is a member, promised an economic “nahda,” or renaissance, within his first hundred days in office. Those hundred days passed, and besides some fairly trivial changes in government retirement pensions, the president and his executive cabinet have done little to address Egypt’s prodigious economic shortcomings.
In an interview with Ayman Nour, founder of Egypt’s Ghad party and former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak’s major challenger in the 2005 presidential election, Dr. Nour suggested to me that the absence of discussion of economic issues may result from fear of discussing a more underlying issue. “The conversation between the military and the civil sphere about the future and the present is a very important issue that should have been clearly discussed in the presidential debates or candidate platforms...My opinion is that this subject was never discussed in an honest way.” In a country where the military has control of “40 percent of the Egyptian economy,” according to one former Egyptian diplomat, Abdullah al-Ashaal, the failure to address the military’s economic stranglehold indicates that political divisions are preventing necessary economic advances.
To illustrate the risks of overlooking these economic issues, let me present two economic challenges the Arab world faces that overshadow the rise of political Islam.
The first great obstacle to the Arab world’s economic growth is simple demography. According to a recent report by the International Labour Organisation, youth unemployment in North Africa will only decline from its present level of 27.5 percent to 26.7 percent by 2017. The ILO also forecasts that youth unemployment rates in the Middle East will increase from 26.4 percent this year to 28.4 percent by 2017. These rates greatly exceed the levels of the rest of the world. A newly unemployed youth in a town in Tunisia set off the Arab Spring with his self-immolation, and the region will stay lit until it can find a path to employing its youth.
A less discussed but equally dangerous challenge faced by the region is bloated public sectors that inhibit innovation and growth. According to a recent International Monetary Fund report, the Middle East and North Africa region holds the highest central government wage bill in the world, and public sector employment as a percentage of nonagricultural employment is a staggering seventy percent in Egypt. As Masood Ahmed, Director of the IMF’s Middle East and Central Asia Department, wrote in that report, “The dominant role of the public sector as employer throughout MENA has distorted labour market outcomes and diverted resources from a potentially more dynamic private sector.”
Considering these challenges and many others, perhaps the most important question facing the region is: Will economic stagnation reinforce the region’s turn toward political Islam, or will it expose the Islamist statesmen for the amateurs they are?
Stay tuned.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Argentine President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner visited Harvard last Thursday, she had to do something she rarely does: Openly answer questions from the public and media. One student even thanked her for the “unique” opportunity. But Kirchner just dodged the tough questions about her failed leadership.
Recently, tens of thousands of protestors turned out in Buenos Aires and several other cities in traditional pot-banging protests to speak out against the Kirchner administration’s increasing authoritarian rule. In the biggest rally since Kirchner took office in 2007, protestors declared, “We will not let this government keep advancing, march for liberty and for the defense of the national constitution.”
President Kirchner has launched a campaign of harassment against the media and journalists, executing a strategy of information control we believe is designed to perpetuate her power. This trend is deeply troubling, not just for the journalists who are under threat, but also for the rights of a democracy to know what its government is doing.
The Kirchner administration employs numerous tools to restrict and pressure the press, including directing government advertising towards friendly media outlets and controlling distribution networks for newsprint in the name of “national security.” Physical attacks against journalists are increasing. The government has pushed through a variety of laws that restrict media rights, including the creation of a politically appointed media regulatory body, and two 2011 laws that dramatically increase government control of the press. One gave effective government control over Papel Prensa, the country’s only newsprint manufacturer, by declaring that the production, sale, and distribution of newsprint were of “public interest.”  The other law expanded the definition of terrorism to include any news or commentary seen as threatening to the government.
Argentine opposition leaders also criticize her use of the “national broadcast” rule under the Media Law to inundate radio and television with her political speeches. For example, a video recently launched by the Industry Ministry blatantly promotes President Kirchner as a genius. Kirchner has invoked a federal rule on carrying presidential broadcasts 16 times in 2012 alone, speaking for over 15 hours in total, and a total of 50 times since the law was passed in October 2009. La Nacion’s lead editorial on September 5 criticized the practice, saying the government has turned “an exceptional instrument of communication into a channel for propaganda, mocking rights and reviling those who think differently.”
Kirchner is effectively at war with the two main media outlets, Clarín and La Nacion. Her ongoing attempts to dismantle the Clarín Group, the country’s largest media conglomerate, began after negative coverage of her government started in 2008. As part of the Media Law passed in 2009, Clarín will lose its cable network on December 7th. Last year, a group of 50 armed military police raided the Buenos Aires headquarters of Cablevisión, which belongs to the Clarín Group.
These tactics hearken back to the days of the Argentine dictatorships, not the democracy Argentina claims to be. When asked at Harvard about the encroaching censorship, President Kirchner made the extraordinary claim that there “has never been so much freedom of expression as now.” She then sought to divert the issue by bringing up the Bush Administration’s jailing of a New York Times journalist for refusing to reveal her source. But there is no denying the facts about her crackdown. Freedom House’s annual Freedom of the Press index notes that during successive Kirchner administrations, Argentina has experienced a significant deterioration in media freedom conditions—one of the most sustained declines worldwide.
Her attitude and policies towards the media are part of a larger pattern of irresponsible policies. The Argentine Government has consistently refused to honor court judgments around the world regarding this debt, including 114 in New York alone. It also refused to allow the International Monetary Fund to perform a standard audit, the only country in the world to do so, while reporting blatantly false inflation figures. And the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering is investigating Argentina for failing to meet its obligations under international anti-money laundering agreements.
President Kirchner may think she can hide these policies from the Argentine people in her bid to remain in power. As she learned in Boston, she must answer to her actions in an honest and direct manner…and without the state media behind her.

For some, third time’s the charm. But for a three-student Harvard team, once was all they needed to win the second annual Undergraduate Stock Pitch Competition.
Despite facing strong competition from five other university teams, P. Connor Haley ’14, Jared D. Sleeper ’14, and Linxi Wu ’14 won the finance contest, which took place at Cornell University last Monday and Tuesday. In the competition, teams two stocks, determining whether they would buy or sell the equity.
“It felt great to win...because we put in a lot of work together as a team,” said Haley, who served as team captain. Teams were given one week to prepare pitches for two stocks, one chosen for each team and one chosen by each team.
Six teams gave ten-minute presentations on the first stock and had five minutes to answer questions from the judges. Each of the three finalist teams delivered another ten-minute presentation, this time on the stock of their choosing.
The Harvard students were assigned Chipotle and chose DeVry as their second stock. Sleeper said the team members kicked into high gear when the competition administrators released the names of the stocks.
“It’s hard to put an hour number on it,” said Sleeper, who serves as president of operations for the Harvard Financial Analysts Club. “But we spent probably like 60 to 70 hours the week before the pitch, preparing the presentations, presenting them, and doing all the research.”
This year was the first time the Harvard team competed in the event. Team members said that, as a result, they did not know how they would rank. They also added that because Harvard presented last, the team members did not see other schools give their presentations, could not judge the strength of the other teams.
Last year's winner, the University of Pennsylvania, was seen as Harvard's strongest competitor. Sleeper noted that while Harvard students learn theoretical economics, students at Wharton start with balance sheets from day one.
“The vast majority of our stuff is self-taught, where as Wharton has been taking courses on valuation and accounting,” Sleeper said. “The most difficult challenge is dealing with that innate advantage that they have in terms of their education.”

Sporting colors from the rainbow flag and gay-friendly pins, Undergraduate Council members opened the second General Meeting of the year by taking part in a photo project organized by the Office of BGLTQ Student Life.
The National Coming Out Day photo opportunity was just one item on the agenda. On Sunday, the Undergraduate Council allocated fall grants, affirmed Council members’ duties, and appointed students to student-faculty committees.
“We are the representatives of student government,” UC President Danny P. Bicknell ’13 said of the Coming Out Day celebrations. “This is a symbolic gesture to show the support here on campus. It’s really to show the breadth of support that exists here on campus.”
Edith C. Benavides ’14, an intern at the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, said she is taking photos of campus organizations, including student groups, sports teams, the Harvard University Police Department, and the Office of Student Life, as part of the National Coming Out Day project.
“We’re trying to bring visibility to the LGBTQ community on campus,” Benavides said at Sunday’s meeting. “The goal is to create visibility and support while networking with student groups.”
Bicknell said that he and Vice President Pratyusha Yalamanchi ’13 have worked with the director of the Office of BGLTQ Student Life to promote projects that create a more open campus.
The UC also passed a number of pieces of legislation Sunday night, including a round of fall grants totaling more than $18,300. The grants, ranging in size from $11.50 to $2,000, fund everything from food at student events to movie screenings.Only one group—the Harvard Islamic Society—was denied funding. The group had originally requested $1,000 for a Ramadan event.
“Ramadan was over the summer, and the College mandates that we cannot fund events that happen over the summer,” said UC Finance Committee chair Matthew R. Marotta ’14.
Bicknell added that the UC is also prohibited from funding events that take place during shopping or reading week. The UC also unanimously passed the UC Outreach Improvement Act, which mandates that Council members host study breaks once per semester in their Houses or Yards, hold monthly meetings with House masters or resident deans, and act as liaisons to a number of student groups.
Finally, UC representatives approved unanimously several appointments to student-faculty committees. According to Bicknell, the Council received nearly 150 applications this year—60 more than last year—for the one-year and two-year committee positions.

UPDATED: Oct. 3, 2012, at 3:04 p.m.
Philip V. Streich ’13, a Harvard student known for his exceptionally broad range of enthusiastic commitments, died Tuesday on his family’s farm near Platteville, Wis., Leverett House administrators wrote in an email Sunday.
At times an enthusiastic entrepreneur, a scientific prodigy, a political activist, a record producer, and a grandiose party host, Streich was among the most well-known members of the Class of 2013 during its first year at Harvard. Friends said Sunday that he will be remembered not only for his impressive accolades but also for serving as a socially unifying force for his freshman class.
“He was happiest at the center of anything,” said C. Tucker Pforzheimer ’13-’14, one of Streich’s freshman roommates.
Streich arrived at Harvard his freshman year already more famous than most students. A native of Princeton, N.J., who moved to Wisconsin in middle school, he had received numerous science awards, including the prestigious Intel Foundation Young Scientist Award, and had co-founded a nanotechnology company.
At 14, Streich enrolled at the University of Wisconsin—Platteville, where he began research on nanotechnology. A discovery about the solubility of nanotubes led him to co-found Graphene Solutions, which he continued to work on even as a student at the College. He left Harvard during his sophomore year to work more on the company and his many other projects.
Though Streich had earned renown as a teenage scientist, friends say that he was more interested in what he could accomplish socially on campus. At Harvard, he sought out the “quintessential college experience,” Pforzheimer said.
When he determined that his dorm room in Weld would not provide ample space for the kind of entertaining he envisioned, he rented an office in the Square to create a novel social space for freshmen.
“The Property,” as the office suite came to be known, attracted a cross-section of the freshmen class to both parties and low-key gatherings.
“[The Property] was the least socially stratified space at Harvard,” Pforzheimer said. “Anyone could go and anyone did.”
Regan Bozman ’13-’14, another of Streich’s freshman roommates, estimated that 60 percent of the class visited “The Property.” Though housed in an office building, Bozman described it as a natural place where blocking groups were formed and relationships started.
“I can’t imagine how other classes convened and met each other,” Bozman said. “It was like an unofficial student center.”
Even with the dedicated social space, Pforzheimer said a steady stream of students came to their door in Weld just for a chance to meet Streich.
Chloe L. Altchek ’13-’14, who lived in Streich’s entryway in Weld, said classmates referred to Streich as “the super genius.” But his humility stood out more than his intellect, she said. During conversations about his research, Altchek said Streich was down-to-earth about his accomplishments.
Though friends said the popularity of Streich’s dorm room led to more than a few run-ins with their entryway proctor, Justin Schoolmaster, Schoolmaster said Streich only got into “the best kind of trouble.”
Schoolmaster said there was never a dull moment when Streich was nearby.
“If I weren’t his proctor and I were in college, I would want to hang out with him too,” Schoolmaster said.
Though known primarily around campus for his scientific work and his stewardship of “The Property,” Streich had yet more claims to fame.
His Porsche, studded with parking tickets, could frequently be seen parked on De Wolfe Street by Leverett House, where he lived before leaving the College.
Through the record company which he founded along with friends, Streich released a single called “Drink Yo’ Milkshake” with Houston-based rapper Ally Smooch.
“Whenever he went in on one of his projects, it was completely open,” Pforzheimer said. “He brought all of us onto 91 Records.”
As he adopted new endeavors, he was always inclusive of others, friends said.
Pforzheimer recalled a time that Streich took him and other friends to an office where he once worked on Brattle Street. In the office, Pforzheimer said Streich opened up a safe that contained his original tubes of graphene from his research and a solar panel. Streich broke the solar panel into little pieces and gave one to everyone in the room.
“He wasn’t about to hold anything over your head and wanted everyone to be involved,” Pforzheimer said.
Streich’s welcoming nature left a lasting impression on others who knew him.
Even after he left Harvard, Streich spent the next summer frequently inviting as many Harvard students as he could to a hotel he stayed at in New York City. He once drove 15 hours in his Porsche, from Chicago to the Hamptons, N.Y., to visit friends.
“Since he was so accomplished, people kind of dwell on that, which is important and impressive, but he was a great guy, and that’s the part that hurts the most,” Schoolmaster said.
From planning parties to researching nanotechnology and more—in between, Streich found time to serve as his county Democratic Party treasurer in Wisconsin and to found a second company, focused on developing solar energy technology—Streich’s efforts were geared toward making a difference.
“As for social impact, who doesn’t want to have a social impact?” Bozman said. “He did. He won.”

On a drizzly night on the Oklahoma River, Harvard men’s heavyweight crew kicked off its fall competition season with a decisive win in the qualifying race followed by an exciting victory in the night sprints grand finals.
The Crimson traveled to the Head of the Oklahoma Regatta in Oklahoma City on Saturday to compete along with more than 50 other university and club teams.
The Harvard crew was composed of eight seniors—seven rowers and coxswain David Fuller—and one junior.
“We all rowed together [on freshman crew] three years ago, so it’s nice to bring that crew back together and just race as seniors,” said James O’Connor, stroke seat of the boat.
The Crimson started the night by rowing in the collegiate eight race against 11 other crews, including boats from Oklahoma City University, Kansas State, and Wichita State.
Under rainy weather but otherwise good water conditions, Harvard easily won the race with a dominating time of 12:58.88, taking home the Norick Cup for the third time.
An OCU boat was second in the head race, finishing more than 25 seconds behind the Crimson boat.
“We did exactly what we wanted to do, which was establish a good rhythm early on in the race, and we just kept it going all the way through,” said senior Parker Washburn, sixth seat of the boat.
With its time in the men’s collegiate eight race, Harvard qualified for the grand finals later that night, where it competed in the night sprints against the top five fastest boats from the men’s eight, a stark difference from the team’s usual morning races.
“None of us had ever rowed anything like that before,” O’Connor said. “Usually we’re racing in the early morning, so it was the complete opposite end of the spectrum. It was really exciting—there’s bright lights, a crowd on the side, music playing, and a shorter distance. It was probably the most fun race I’ve ever had.”
The Crimson lined up in lane five against three OCU crews as well as two boats from the USRowing National Training Center: the US Heavyweights and the US Lightweights, both composites of current and past Olympic rowers.
“[The USRowing teams] just had the Olympics this last summer, so they’re not in the peak of their performance, by any stretch of the imagination,” said senior third-seat Josh Hicks, referring to the squad’s decreased practice time following the Olympics. “So we had no idea [whether or not we were going to win], and it’s fantastic going into a race with the attitude that you’ve got to go as hard as you can and let the cards fall where they may.”
Although one of the OCU boats and the US Lightweight crew shot out to an early lead, the Harvard boat found its stride about 250 meters into the race.
But the US Heavyweights quickly caught up to the Crimson boat, making the race a fight to the finish.
“The US Heavyweights were like a chopper jet taking off, just really slow to start,” Hicks said. “But once they got moving, once they got the waves turning, then they were eating us up, [and] they were chewing into it pretty quickly.”
The Harvard crew edged out the US Heavyweights boat by 0.152 seconds, finishing the fast-paced 500-meter race in 1:19.357. An OCU boat finished in third with a time of 1:20.787.
“It was so short—by the time we had time to catch our breaths, David Fuller, our coxswain, was yelling out that there was 100 meters to go, which is nothing,” Hicks said. “It was just really good coming up with a win. It [was] something we hoped for, not something we expected going in.”
For the Crimson, the trip down south was also a reunion trip for Harvard’s veteran rowers.
“The crew that traveled to Oklahoma isn’t a set varsity boat.… It’s a sort of ‘thank you for sticking with the program for four years’ kind of trip for the seniors on our team,” Hicks said.
Harvard men’s heavyweight crew will stay in Cambridge for its remaining two fall regattas: the Head of the Charles and the Tail of the Charles.
The Crimson will attempt to repeat its 2011 win at the Head of the Charles, which takes place Oct. 20 to 21 on Harvard’s home course.
“Being the defending champs [of the Head of the Charles], there’s certainly a lot of energy around the squad,” Hicks said. “People are really excited [to] see if we can go out and impress ourselves with the results.”
After nearly a month without competiton, the Crimson will take the water for the Tail of the Charles on Nov. 17.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In Friday night’s contest against Holy Cross—the last team to beat the Crimson—Harvard did far more than just avenge that early-season loss from a year ago.
The Crimson unequivocally, unceremoniously, ripped apart the Crusaders in the most emphatic first-half performance in the program’s history.
Forty-nine points in 30 minutes isn’t supposed to happen. The math is dizzying. Over a point a minute. On pace for nearly 100.
But in that first half, before the starters were pulled, nothing—not a little (or a lot of) rain, not a Holy Cross defense that seemed to be constantly backpedaling—could slow down the Crimson. Playing the Death Star to Holy Cross’ Alderaan, Harvard found the end zone in all of its first-half drives. Holy Cross, meanwhile, managed only a field goal.
Romps don’t get much bigger than the one at Harvard Stadium on Friday. It was Reagan vs. Mondale, Kevin McAllister vs. Joe Pesci, Burr vs. Hamilton—a duel turned public execution.
And that final scene from Scarface? Yeah, that was the whole first half.
Indeed, the Crimson starters dominated those opening two quarters. Senior quarterback Colton Chapple, who was pulled after the half, threw for 260 yards on just 13 completions and was one passing touchdown away from tying the single-game program record. And at times, it took three or four Crusaders to bring down senior running back Treavor Scales. With giant humans hanging on his limbs, Scales looked like he was merely wading through mud. Those defenders were an inconvenience more than an impediment.
Naturally, the scoring slowed with the Crimson replacements in, and the Harvard attack tallied only three points in the second half. But that didn’t matter in the slightest. In the Crimson’s 52-3 win, the game was over well before halftime.
Sure, Harvard was favored coming into Friday night’s contest against Holy Cross. After all, the Crimson was undefeated, and the Crusaders had yet to win a game.
But it was supposed to be sort of close, right? In its last two games, Holy Cross had let leads slip away in the fourth quarter.
Heading into Friday’s contest, it seemed like this was a Crusaders team which, battling injury, was on the verge of that first ‘W’.
“Regardless of their record, you know, you see it on paper, but [when] you really look into it with the stats…how they lost those two games,” Scales said before Friday’s contest, “you know that you’re expecting a tough team.”
Against the Crimson, Holy Cross was the furthest thing from tough, and Crusaders coach Tom Gilmore knew it.
“52-3 is a hard pill to swallow, and especially when you watch your team make multiple mistakes and just make it easy on then,” Gilmore said. “Dropped passes, fumbled snaps, things like that.”
Yes, the underdog story went all wrong on Friday. As it turned out, the glass slipper was a horrific fit.
Some of the blame clearly goes to a Holy Cross squad that was outwitted and outmatched. But certainly, the Crimson deserves much of the credit. You don’t score 49 points or limit the other team to three in the first half by accident.
“It was a combination of us just getting completely in sync in the first half and playing against, quite frankly, a very banged-up Holy Cross squad,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said.
In the game’s opening minutes, a ruthless, Genghis-Khanesque blowout didn’t seem in the cards. While the Crimson marched seemingly unopposed downfield for the score in the team’s opening drive, the Crusaders responded with a possession that was similarly dominant, though it culminated in a field goal.
Harvard scored again, blocked the subsequent Holy Cross punt, and returned it for a touchdown.
But for the Crusaders, the second quarter was even uglier, when things went downhill faster than a freshman with a bottle of Rubinoff.
It became a dismal game of ping pong for Holy Cross. Harvard touchdown, Holy Cross punt. Harvard touchdown, Holy Cross punt—you get the idea. When the 15-minute onslaught came to a close, the Crimson had put 28 points on the board. By that point, the fat lady had already run through her operatic repertoire and was moving on to showtunes, and the rest of the game was just running out the clock.
Of course, it’s still early in the season, too early to fully extrapolate trends. But after this win, accomplished with a ruthlessness that would make ol’ John Rockefeller smile, I’ll harken back to a quote Murphy made before the start of the year.
“I don’t know if we’re any good, I really don’t,” Murphy said before the team’s first game. “I know you guys think that’s being ‘whatever,’ but we haven’t played anyone. It’s such a work in progress when you’ve got so many new faces and moving parts and schedule and so forth.”
Now, with the team sitting at 3-0, this much is clear: Harvard’s not just good. Harvard may be downright dominant.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last time that Harvard men’s water polo team had a nine-game winning streak, Mitt Romney was running for governor of Massachusetts.
Fast forward 10 years and the Crimson once again posted nine straight wins.
Harvard traveled to Lewisburg, Pa., over the weekend to compete in the Bison Invitational against the Navy Academy B-team, Johns Hopkins, Toronto, and host Bucknell.
The Crimson improved to 12-6 over the weekend, winning its first three games before falling to Bucknell in a close 10-8 match on the final day of play.
Before Sunday’s match, the Bison were responsible for Harvard’s last loss, an 11-3 defeat more than two weeks ago.
Since then, Harvard has gone on a tear, outscoring opponents, 121-80, and posting a nine-game winning streak. Conversely, Bucknell struggled, dropping five straight games heading into the invitational. For the Crimson, the game was important for redemption purposes.
“We kind of wanted to come out and avenge the loss,” said junior goalie Jimmy Field. “They handled us pretty well at home, so we wanted to come out and give them a good challenge in their pool.”
But the team was unable to keep the streak alive.
“It’s been a great nine games,” Field said. “It was tough that we couldn’t get that tenth, but we still want to take it one game at a time.”
BUCKNELL 10, HARVARD 8
In the final game of the weekend, the Bison got off to a four-goal lead at the half after outscoring the Crimson 4-1 in the second period. This was the first time all weekend that Harvard had trailed at intermission.
Coming out of halftime, the Crimson pushed back and tied the game at 8-8 going into the fourth period. But Harvard was unable to complete the comeback as the Bison scored two more to end the game at 10-8.
“I think we’re happy with the way we’re playing right now, but we’re not satisfied,” coach Ted Minnis said. “We won 12 games so far this year and won 10 games last year, total, and it’s not even Oct. 1 yet. I think we all feel we can get better every game by working hard and playing more consistently as the season goes on.”
HARVARD 16, TORONTO 8
The Crimson started out strong and kept a steady lead throughout the game in a 16-8 defeat of the University of Toronto, outscoring the Blues in the first period, 5-0, and going up 10-3 at the half.
Sophomore John Holland-McCowan scored four goals, while sophomore Ryan Rule contributed three more and two assists. Freshmen Noah Harrison and Ben Zepfel and co-captain Max Eliot each scored two goals apiece.
Freshman Colin Woolway and Field split time in net, accruing six and five saves, respectively.
“[The goalies] have done a great job,” Minnis said. “When they’re splitting playing time they’re combining for double digit saves, which is all you could ask for. They’re making all the saves they’re supposed to make, and then making a few more.”
HARVARD 9, JOHNS HOPKINS 8
In the second match of the weekend, the Crimson fended off a late-game push from Johns Hopkins and scraped by with a one-goal lead to get its second win of the day.
Zepfel scored a hat trick and six other players contributed goals. Although Harvard led by two after the half, its lead was trimmed to one going into the fourth frame. Both teams scored twice and the Crimson was able to hang on for the win.
The defense was crucial in holding off the Blue Jays attack for much of the game. Harrison led the team with three steals and freshman Robbie Fluegge and junior co-captain William Roller added two each. Woolway played the entire match in net and posted eight saves.
HARVARD 15, NAVY B 11
In its weekend opener, Harvard went up against the Midshipmen B-team while the Navy A-team played a tournament in California.
After an even first quarter in which both teams posted four scores, the Crimson went into halftime with an 8-7 advantage.
Harvard separated itself from the Midshipmen in the second half, outscoring Navy, 7-4, to clinch the game.
Freshmen Blake Lee and Zepfel were pivotal on offense for the Crimson, scoring a combined nine of Harvard’s 15 goals. Lee led the way with five goals.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a slow start at the Nittany Lion Women’s Invitational this weekend, the Harvard women’s golf team stormed back to finish in second place out of 17 teams at Penn State’s Blue Course.
The Crimson trailed only Penn State, which, for the second weekend in a row, finished ahead of Harvard at a tournament.
The Crimson gave its best performance on Sunday, shooting a team score of 284 (-4). This marked Harvard’s lowest single-day team score in the program’s history, according to coach Kevin Rhoads.
Every one of the team’s counted scores was at or below par, lead by junior captain Bonnie Hu, who posted an individual score of 69 (-3).
Hu is now the only Crimson to dip into the sixties so far this season.
“[On Sunday] everything came together,” said Hu, a Crimson business editor. “Everyone played well.”
Sunday’s team play was good enough to give Harvard second place, with the Crimson finishing six strokes ahead of Old Dominion.
Early in the weekend, rain muddied the course, creating problems for players. But by the time Sunday came the course was in prime condition.
On Friday, highly touted freshman Christine Lin shot Harvard’s best score on the day, 73 (+1), leading the Crimson to an overall team score of 303 (+15). Lin finished tied for 11th  place with an individual score of 221 (+5) on the tournament.
Sophomore Tiffany Lim led Harvard on Saturday, shooting an even par for the day. The Crimson remained in third place, finishing with a score of 299 (+11).
Lim led Harvard individually, placing in a tie for eighth at +3. Lim finished eleven strokes behind the individual champion, the Nittany Lions’ Ellen Ceresko, who finished at -8 for the weekend, seven strokes ahead of anyone else. Princeton’s Kelly Shon was the only Ivy League representative to finish ahead of Lim, shooting a 215 (-1).
At the tournament’s conclusion, the Crimson boased a score of 886 (+22). Every player finished in the top 30 of the individual standings out of the field of 103.
For the second week in a row, Ivy League rivals Princeton and Yale finished behind Harvard, the reigning Ancient Eight champion.
The Tigers placed sixth, 14 shots back of the Crimson, with a score of 900 (+36), while the Bulldogs shot a 43-over-par 907 en route to ninth place.
No Harvard player posted a score in the 80s on the weekend on a course that competitors averaged a 78.5 per round overall.
Battling poor conditions on the first day of competition, the field averaged a score of 79.5, which all five Crimson golfers finished below. The team also posted five rounds at or below par.
Only champion Penn State notched a better single round than Harvard, turning in a five-under-par 283 in the second round.
For the tournament, the Nittany Lions finished at two under, 24 shots ahead of the Crimson.
Last year, Harvard placed ninth at the Nittany Lion Invitational, its worst performance of its fall season. In the two-day tournament, the Crimson shot a team score of 624 (+48).
Then a freshman, Lim once again led the team, with a score of 151 (+7) over two days. Lim finished tied for 15th place.
On a team with only five players this season, Harvard counts on everyone to contribute.
“The team is not only close-knit socially, but also in terms of skill,” Rhoads said. “Each member’s individual score counted [toward the team score] on at least two different days.”
“Not one player stood out. We all played well.” Hu said.
The team boasts no seniors, relying on a junior captain Hu, two sophomores, and two freshmen.
Hu won last year’s individual Ivy League championship as a sophomore.
The Crimson’s youth has not stopped it from finishing in the top three in both of its tournaments this year.
Last weekend, Harvard placed third behind the Nittany Lions and Nova Southeastern University at the Yale Invitational.
The Crimson will compete in its final fall season tournament in three weekends when it travels to the Stanford Invitational.

Since meeting head to head for the first time this fall, U.S. Senator Scott Brown and Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren will debate for a second time tonight in Lowell, Mass.
A sign of the Massachusetts U.S. Senate race's national prominence, the host of NBC's "Meet the Press" David Gregory will moderate the hour-long debate. Both WHDH-TV and C-SPAN plan to broadcast the debate live at 7 p.m. The Boston Herald will also have a live feed on its website.
While the first debate passed without a decisive victor, recent polls have shown Warren creeping ahead of Brown with only a little more than a month left until election day. Tonight's debate is expected to be one of the few remaining opportunities the candidates have to change the course of the race.

On Sunday Sept. 30, Dudley House beat Kirkland House in the final round of innertube water polo to win the second annual Harvard IM tournament.
Most players at Harvard jumped in with little to no previous experience. Leo D. Guttmann '15, a member of the Quincy House team, admitted he knew nothing about the sport and that he participated mainly out of curiosity.
Invented in 1969 by Gary Colberg, intramural sport director at UC Davis, innertube water polo, or ITWP as it's referred to by ardent fans, has spread to more than a dozen universities as well as numerous recreational adult leagues.
"It'd be really cool if they made it a regular IM instead of just a tournament," said Wesley W. Mann '13, a member of the Eliot team, who also participated in the last semester's tournament.
Josh T. Fries '14, a referee for the event, echoed Mann's sentiments, saying he hoped for a second tournament in the spring or more regular matches. While this year's tournament was only open to upperclassmen Houses, some freshman expressed interest in participating.
"I think it sounds awesome," said Alexandra R. Forelli '16. "I like to try bizarre sports."

Each  year, Harvard's Nieman Foundation rewards fellowships to 24 journalists  who then spend a year taking classes at Harvard. Among this year's  prestigious crop of fellows is Jennifer B. McDonald, an editor at The  New York Times Book Review.

 
Did you ever write a review you now wish you could take back?
My  opinions change all the time, not necessarily dramatically but in  subtle ways, and I think that's probably true of a lot of critics. I  look back at almost all my writing and wish I could change something  after the fact.
 
Could you elaborate on your chosen course of study, and what you hope to achieve through it?
I'm  taking a course on historical approaches to literary criticism (English  194, "Literary Criticism: Major Approaches") with James Engell. It's  excellent; he's an incredible lecturer. I'm also taking Lit 113, "Existential Fictions: From Saint Augustine to Jean-Paul Sartre and  Beyond" with Verena Conley. These classes look at literature, philosophy  and criticism and how these disciplines affect our lives... When I  applied for the Nieman I said that I wanted to come away with a stronger  foundation for doing my work at the Book Review, and wanted the  opportunity to study these things in a place known for its excellence.
 
What's your creative process?
It's  generous for you to think that I have a creative process! When I've  been assigned to write something, I spend a long time reading and  thinking and flailing and agonizing, trying to figure out what it is I  want to say and how I want to say it. Once I have the spark of an idea I  sort of have to force myself to sit down and get it all out on the  page… For me, the process really starts bearing fruit in the revision  stage.
 
What's a favorite story from your time at the Book Review?
One  of the most satisfying experiences I've had as an editor at the Book  Review was hearing from one of my reviewers that she had heard from a  novelist, whose book she had reviewed, that the review, which was mixed,  had somehow changed that writer's life...That was such an unexpected  and gratifying response—to think that we have given something to the  artist as well as to the broader audience of readers. 
 
Your  beats for the New York Times include linguistics, race, dance, and sex  and gender. How did you develop such a diverse array of interests? 
Before  I became a journalist I wanted to be a ballet dancer...So that's where  my expertise in that realm comes from. I'm also a big word-nerd...and  have always been fascinated by questions of usage and the study of what  makes language work. Sex and gender—I'm a woman. I have, as I'm sure  most women do, pretty strong discussions of women's role in society...  I'm interested in how culture tries to define people and how women and  other historical minorities have sought to shift the balance of power.
