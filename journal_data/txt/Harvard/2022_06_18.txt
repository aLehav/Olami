After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
U.S. Representative Gregory F. Murphy (R-N.C.) called on Harvard to disclose and divest its endowment from any potential holdings in Chinese companies deemed a threat to national security by the federal government in a letter to the school last week.
Murphy asked Harvard to reveal whether its $53.2 billion endowment holds any investments in companies that appear on federal government sanction lists, which target entities that act “contrary to the national security interests or foreign policy of the United States.” He also asked the school to disclose any policies restricting investments in sanctioned companies, as well as whether the endowment has divested from such holdings in 2022.
Murphy requested a response from the University by June 23.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton confirmed that Harvard received Murphy’s letter, but declined to comment further.
The letter comes as top American universities face increased scrutiny from the federal government over their ties to China. The U.S. Department of Education opened an investigation into Harvard’s foreign funding in early 2020. Separately, Harvard and other schools are currently lobbying against legislation that would impose more stringent disclosure requirements for American institutions that receive foreign funding.
Murphy sent similar letters to the 15 private universities with the largest endowments in the country. In his letter, addressed to University President Lawrence S. Bacow, he wrote that endowments “are now sophisticated institutional investors,” citing the high returns universities enjoyed last fiscal year. Harvard Management Company, which controls the University’s endowment, reported a 33.6 percent return on its investments in fiscal year 2021.
“These large returns are at least partly due to large endowments’ ability to diversify their portfolios and take on more risk than average investors,” he wrote. “However, diversification for endowments should not mean investing in entities that are deemed an unacceptable risk to national security.”
The letter cites a 2019 report in BuzzFeed News, which found that many of the country’s largest endowments — including those of Princeton, Duke, and MIT — are indirectly invested in companies tied to China’s detainment and surveillance of Uyghur Muslims. The report did not single out Harvard for holding such investments.
Murphy wrote that higher education institutions have a “moral obligation” not to invest in companies that “contribute to human rights violations and are detrimental to the national security of the United States,” due to tax benefits university endowments receive from the government.
“Endowments must not invest in entities that are supporting the imprisonment of Uyghur Muslims or aiding the Russian Federation’s horrific invasion of Ukraine,” he wrote.
Harvard said in March that it does not possess direct investments or any “material indirect holdings” in Russian companies.
In April, Bloomberg reported that Harvard is considering cutting back on investments in China due to risks associated with the increasing turbulence in the country’s domestic market, as well as heightened tensions between the U.S. and Asia’s largest economy. (HMC spokesperson Patrick S. McKiernan declined to comment on the report at the time.)
In an interview with POLITICO, Murphy said recent movements by universities to divest from fossil fuels provide “precedent” for endowments to divest from other companies. Harvard announced last September that it would allow its remaining investments in the fossil fuel industry to expire.
“If they tell their investment company ‘we want to divest out of companies in China,’ it’s very easily done,” Murphy said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just a day after thousands of people across the United States rallied for stronger federal and state action on gun control, a group of 20 senators announced a bipartisan deal to curb gun violence Sunday.
Harvard affiliates, many of whom attended and organized the Saturday rallies, reacted to the news with surprise and hope — but say the path to sweeping gun violence reform is still long.
With lead negotiators including Senators Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas), the deal includes provisions for increased investment in youth and family mental health services, as well as resources for “red-flag laws” that help prevent individuals who pose a threat to others and themselves from accessing weapons.
“Our plan increases mental health resources, improves school safety and support for students, and helps ensure dangerous criminals and those who are adjudicated as mentally ill can’t purchase weapons,” the senators wrote in a joint statement, which touted the deal as a “commonsense, bipartisan” effort.
“Most importantly, our plan saves lives while also protecting the constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans,” they added in the statement.
Though many Harvard students said the deal’s provisions were modest, they noted the significance of the bipartisan effort. March for Our Lives co-founder David M. Hogg ’23 said though more needs to be done, the deal marks a step forward.
“It’s more than has happened in pretty much any student at Harvard’s lifetimes that are under 30,” he said. “So it’s pretty significant.”
Many found certain provisions in the deal — such as offering states resources to enact “red flag” laws and funding mental health resources — reason for hope.
Ruth Zakarin, the executive director of the Massachusetts Coalition to Prevent Gun Violence, lauded the deal’s provision for closing the “boyfriend loophole.” The deal would extend a law preventing domestic abusers from owning guns to include abusers who do not live with their victims, do not have children with them, or are not married to them.
Zakarin, who has worked to help people affected by domestic violence, said survivors and activists have long sought after the provision.
“I know that there’s been a lot of effort and a lot of discussion about the importance of closing the boyfriend loophole to allow for more protections for survivors who are in dating relationships with their abusive partners,” she said. “So to see that move forward is a big step.”
Still, Zakarin and many Harvard affiliates said they felt the deal was missing stricter gun control measures — such as instating universal background checks and banning semi-automatic weapons, measures already enforced in Massachusetts.
Elizabeth C. “Liz” Hoveland ’22, who attended the Boston march Saturday, said they were disappointed the deal did not include universal background checks. They added that they would have liked to see the deal raise the minimum age of gun ownership to 21.
“I’m heartbroken, absolutely heartbroken, that they didn’t call to expand background checks,” they said. “It seems like bare minimum.”
Madeline J. Ranalli ’24, who helped found the Boston March for Our Lives chapter, said that though she was initially “excited” about the deal, she believes some of its provisions may promote practices that increase policing in schools and actively harm students of color.
“Unfortunately, there’s definitely a flavor to this of ‘We’re going to combat shootings and gun violence with more surveillance, more police presence,’ which studies have shown don’t lead to stopping mass shootings,” she said. “They just lead to disproportionate discipline of students of color.”
RuQuan S. Brown ’24, who spoke at the Washington, D.C., March for Our Lives rally, also urged lawmakers to consider the potential impact the provisions put forth in the deal could have on Black and Brown people and poor people.
The bipartisan deal has coincided with state legislative action that some argue may put more people at risk. Ranalli noted that on Monday, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine signed into law a bill that allows teachers to carry guns in school after no more than 24 hours of training and eight hours of annual training.
Though the Senate deal has not yet been finalized, David C. King, a senior lecturer at the Harvard Kennedy School, said he believes the potential bill will be passed as long as both sides stick to the framework.
Moreover, King said the compromises the senators made in the deal are “the only political way to actually get things done.”
“It’s not necessarily beautiful policymaking or the ideal solution, but it is a good way of getting the votes together to get to the next stage of the game,” he said.
Ranalli said the deal’s bipartisan support is not as historic as some believed, noting that of the 10 Republican senators backing the deal, four are not running for reelection, five will not face off in the ballot box for another four years, and one cannot run for reelection until 2024.
“Ultimately, this was not as big of a display of courage as I think a lot of people hoped it would be,” she said. “A lot of Republicans are just unwilling to make a compromise like that because it doesn’t help their reelection chances.”
Zakarin, whose advocacy work focuses on Massachusetts, said the laws in one area of the country can still affect the safety of those in others.
“Massachusetts doesn’t exist in a bubble, so weaker gun laws and gun violence that happen in other states still impact the safety of residents in the Commonwealth,” she said. “We see the Massachusetts model as the floor, not the ceiling, and we need for other states nationally to get on board with this model to keep folks across the country safe, but to also impact the safety of people here in the Commonwealth.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Before scholars like the former Congressional Budget Office director Douglas W. Elmendorf and former chair of the Federal Reserve Ben S. Bernanke ’75, led some of the country’s pre-eminent economic institutions, they cut their teeth in Dale W. Jorgenson’s classroom.
A University professor whose tenure at Harvard spanned over five decades, Jorgenson died at the age of 89 at a hospital in Cambridge on June 8.
Colleagues and family members remembered Jorgenson for being devoted to his many students and for producing influential research in the field of econometrics.
Elmendorf, who now serves as dean of the Harvard Kennedy School, mourned Jorgenson’s death in a statement to The Crimson.
“Dale Jorgenson was a brilliant economist, an excellent teacher of econometrics to me and my classmates in graduate school many years ago, and a welcoming person when I came back to Harvard to be HKS dean,” Elmendorf wrote. “I will miss him very much.”
James H. Stock, Harvard’s Vice Provost for Climate and Sustainability, pointed to Jorgenson’s “very many students” as one of his legacies.
“He was a great mentor,” Stock said. “And he produced a large number of students that have gone on to do really important things.”
Kari A. Jorgenson ’97, Jorgenson’s daughter, said her father “loved his students.”
In turn, Jorgenson was also beloved by his students and was frequently invited to attend their extracurricular performances, according to his longtime faculty assistant, Trina L. Ott.
“He got invited to many of the house dinners,” Ott said, explaining that Jorgenson accepted as many invitations as he could, with only one request: his wife, Linda Jorgenson, had to be invited as well.
Kari Jorgenson said her parents were “very much a team.”
“I think in their 50 years together they probably didn’t spend more than a dozen nights apart,” she added.
Jorgenson was born in Bozeman, Montana, in 1933, and received his Ph.D. from Harvard in 1959. He started his career as a professor at the University of California, Berkeley before moving to Harvard in 1969.
Only two years after Jorgenson joined Harvard’s faculty, he was awarded the John Bates Clark medal. The citation for the prize celebrated his efforts combining the study of economics with statistics.
Jorgenson’s “prolonged exploration of the determinants of investment spending, whatever its ultimate lessons, will certainly long stand as one of the finest examples of the marriage of theory and practice in economics,” the citation said.
Robert J. Barro, a professor of Economics at Harvard, said he believed Jorgenson also deserved a Nobel Prize.
Barro said the “most important” work of Jorgenson’s career came from his joint research with Zvi Griliches, in which they thought about the sources of productivity growth and its impact on overall economic growth.
“A lot of people thought they would get a Nobel Prize for that,” Barro said. “But it didn't happen.”
Stock said Jorgenson’s work played a “really important role” in the development of the carbon tax.
“He was able to do the policy analysis of carbon taxes and how they would affect the economy in an integrated way,” Stock said. “He provided the framework that endures to this day as to how that question is answered.”
“It’s really prescient, early work,” Stock added.
Benjamin M. Friedman ’66, a former chair of the Economics Department at Harvard, said the field of production theory and investment theory is “very different” from when Jorgenson first started researching the topic.
“I think that will be one of his great legacies,” Friedman said. “You now have a network of people all over the world applying Jorgernson’s production theory framework to all sorts of questions.”
“He was a giant in the economics profession,” Friedman added.
Barro said Jorgenson could be considered “somewhat on the cold side” by people who did not know him well.
“But actually he was a very caring person,” Barro added. “And I had a lot of good and close interactions with him.”
Stock said Jorgenson’s initial, exterior presentation was “very formal.”
“He had the sort of demeanor that no graduate student would ever think of calling him Dale,” Stock said. “They would call him Professor Jorgenson.”
“But when you got to know him — underneath that formal presentation — was someone who really cared about people,” Stock added.
Jorgenson even invited undergraduate students to his home for a Halloween party where attendees were greeted with Taylor Swift music, Ott said.
“He loved Taylor Swift,” Ott said. “It’s just not what people would have thought of Professor Jorgenson.”
Linda M. Jorgenson, a lawyer and Jorgenson’s wife, said her husband died with her and their two children by his side.
“He certainly was the love of my life and a really good person,” she said. “I’m very lucky.”
In addition to his wife, Linda, and their children Eric and Kari, Jorgenson is survived by three grandchildren.
