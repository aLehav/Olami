After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In anticipation of Harvard’s 23rd annual Arts First festival, a four-day celebration of both student and faculty artistry, The Crimson profiled four of the individuals who are making contributions to the event, both onstage and behind the scenes.
Jack Megan, director of Harvard’s Office for the Arts and festival producer
An artist in his own right, these days Jack Megan mostly directs his creativity into helping other artists. “I’m lucky to be working with such creative students,” he says. “It’s like a gift—I have the best job at Harvard.” Megan is truly a jack-of-all-trades when it comes to his participation in Arts First: He’s doing everything from general organization to direct oversight of various productions and installations.
“The biggest challenge with Arts First is how to always stay fresh and come up with new ideas,” Megan says. “But it’s a challenge in a good way—we try to add to the festival every year.” He spoke of the organizational challenges of coordinating the busy schedules of members of the Harvard community but praised the collaborative nature of the festival and the dedication and flexibility of its participants. “You can’t stop Harvard students from anything if they want it enough,” he says.
When asked what he most hopes the festival will achieve, Megan spoke of themes of inclusivity and togetherness. “Arts First will be a success if it represents well our community and its diverse culture,” Megan says. “I want that reflected in our art making. I love the joyful spirit of Arts First…. People come together for these days to affirm and celebrate one another through the arts.”
Rakesh Khurana, Dean of Harvard College and performer
“I look forward to the Arts Festival every year,” Dean Rakesh Khurana says. “It’s a celebration of creativity where we support our friends and colleagues, and it highlights the collaborative and transformative power of art to engage the imagination.” Khurana can be seen prancing across the stage on May 2 in the kickoff event of the Arts First performance fair: “Swan Lake: For the Birds!”, a spoof of the Tchaikovsky classic.
Khurana participated in various dramatic productions throughout his high school career but claims his talents ultimately aligned more with directing and producing. His performance in “Swan Lake,” he says, reminds him of those secondary school times. “One of my fondest memories from high school is the week leading up to a performance, when it seems like it’ll be impossible to pull off,” he says. “But then you watch it come together…. You just have to let go and see what happens.”
While discussing the process of practicing his part for the ballet, Khurana also meditates on the merits of the general process of artistic development. “Learning means making mistakes, and that’s important to note for the general Harvard culture,” he says. “Real learning means taking off the mask of perfection and putting yourself out there.”
“I hope students will come out and support and affirm the most important part of what makes us human: our capacity to create,” he adds.
Thomas A. Dingman ’67, Dean of Freshmen and performer
Dean Tom Dingman focused his energies on sports in his youth and had never participated in theater prior to his role as one of the featured dancers in “Swan Lake,” though he has attended every Arts First festival since the event first began and describes it as the highlight of his year. “I’m honestly the least likely pick for this,” he says. “I have two left feet. My only dance background coming in was square dancing as a young kid in the country.”
Given his lack of prior performance experience, Dingman says that his involvement in Arts First is driven in part by a desire to increase the accessibility of Harvard’s administrators. “I know there can be a divide between the students and the administration, so we try to do whatever we can to be seen as normal human beings,” he says.
When asked how he responded when he was approached about the role, Dingman smiles. “Who can say no to Jack Megan?” he says. “I think he’s the most charismatic person at Harvard—he’s like the pied piper. I have so much respect for him. I’m very fond of Jack.”
Ileana C. Riveron ’17, choreographer of “Swan Lake” and lead performer
Lilly Riveron, a former dancer with the Royal Ballet in London and with the Boston Ballet, never imagined in the past that she would attend college at all. Though an injury cut short her professional ballet career, she says she has no regrets. “Harvard has honestly been the biggest blessing of my life, and the Harvard Ballet Club and this project have been the biggest gifts of my time so far at Harvard,” she says.
Besides choreographing the show, Riveron also works as the costume designer and assists the lighting designer and tech crews. She praises the humor, lack of inhibitions, humility, and kindness of the faculty members she has been teaching since early February. “It’s been great to imagine these esteemed academics as the various characters and figure out how to choreograph the show so it would still embody the famous roles but would also be appropriate for the dean of the school,” she says.
Megan, Dingman, and Khurana all applaud Riveron and her abilities in teaching them the “Swan Lake” choreography. “Lilly was very patient and came at it in a generous way. She’s thoughtful, kind, patient, encouraging—everything I value in a good teacher,” Khurana says.
Arts First will run from April 30 to May 3 and is expected to draw a crowd of several thousand people, both members of the Harvard community and citizens from the greater Boston area.

“There was something there that I fundamentally couldn’t understand,” Ethan R. Pierce ’15 says of his first trip to Israel and Palestine last spring. “I felt a need to further explore Israel-Palestine for myself. I went to the region and found this multiplicity of narratives that were often conflicting but were very real for the people who were experiencing them and living them.” For Pierce, a Visual and Environmental Studies concentrator, these unresolved tensions led to “here, without,” a year-long collaborative artistic exploration of the region’s culture, history, and contemporary life. The project, part of which Pierce submitted as his senior thesis, will culminate in a final exhibition of works by participating artists, opening at the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts on May 4.
“here, without” has brought a creative discussion of Israel-Palestine relations to Harvard’s campus in a variety of ways over the past year. During Wintersession 2015, Pierce organized a week-long conference featuring lectures and workshops led by contemporary artists, curators, and scholars from both the Israel-Palestine region and the United States. The conference coincided with an exhibition of works in progress from “here, without” in the Arthur M. Sackler Museum. The Carpenter Center opening in May will also serve as the launch for two books related to the project—one a collection of participants’ poetry, another a catalogue of their visual art and critical essays—the publication of which Pierce funded with help from both a Kickstarter campaign and the VES department.
Pierce, who grew up on a farm in Maine, had little experience traveling before coming to Harvard. He participated in the Harvard College Israel Trek over spring break last year, an experience which provided the inspiration for his project. “The trip was supposed to be this very neutral look at the region, but we spent 10 days in Israel and an afternoon in the West Bank,” he says. “I came away feeling a need to continue working with this material, to continue exploring it not just academically but within an artistic context, within a framework of other individuals who were interested in the topic.”
His idea for a collective exploration of Israel-Palestine relations developed over the course of his senior year into a program of biweekly seminars and workshops for 35 participating Harvard- and MIT-affiliated “artist-residents.” Pierce also returned to Israel and Palestine last fall to contact artists and curators working in the region, who became mentors to the participants.
The artists, who ranged from 19-year-old students to alumni in their mid-forties, produced a variety of creative works examining life in the Middle East today. English concentrator Josh L. Ascherman ’17 created a mixed-media work entitled “Palimpsest,” a layered collage of newspaper clippings partially obscured by black acrylic paint. “I've been able to do a lot of exploration of my personal history and my relationship to art, and I've had a chance to do some thinking about ethics as well,” Ascherman says in an email.
Professional dancer Rossi Lamont Walter, Jr. ’14, who has been living in Tel Aviv for the past year, contributed a poetic essay entitled “Questions for a Foreigner” based on inquiries he often receives as an American in Israel. Walter says that the “here, without” project had both personal meaning for him and a broader significance for the university. “For me, ‘here, without’ was important because I was part of a group of colleagues who were actively interested in learning about what ‘Israel-Palestine’ means—about history, about contemporary circumstances, and about art,” he says.
Pierce says that he faced a variety of challenges as he developed the project. For instance, the international Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions Movement, initiated in Palestine in 2005 as a means to pressure the Israeli government to grant broader rights to Palestinians, calls for the boycott of Israeli cultural institutions. “So it gets really complicated,” Pierce says. “If you have a curator who works at an Israeli institution or has curated in Israel come to speak at Harvard as part of this project, have you broken the cultural boycott? With breaking the cultural boycott, you could very quickly lose the support of any Palestinian artist or be cut off from that community.”
Exploring and representing a deeply divisive political issue presented many challenges to Pierce. “How do you deal with this really complicated area ethically and responsibly, and also just knowing that no matter what you do, you’re going to offend a lot of people because this is a contentious issue on which people have very set and very strong views?” he says. Despite these difficulties, Pierce says that the project was transformative, both for himself and, he hopes, for Harvard. “It was personal exploration and personal growth, and also creating an alternative discursive space at Harvard...to explore these really complicated issues.”

Reading Karl Ove Knausgaard's fourth addition to the autobiographical series “My Struggle” is an exercise in voyeurism, but a vividly engaging one at that. Set during the last few teenage years of the author’s life, “Book Four” is a revealing tale of family, sexuality, incompetence, and independence. Knausgaard peels backs the curtains on his early years and brings forth a brutally honest story that remains hard to tear away from despite being incredibly mundane.
The events and time frame of “Book Four” might appear disjointed, but Knausgaard’s touch for transition makes the chapterless book move seamlessly. The story opens with 18-year-old Karl Ove leaving home to teach in a small Northern Norwegian village for a year while focusing on his dream of becoming a great writer. For a hundred-odd pages, Karl Ove moves into his new flat, starts up as a teacher, and ingratiates himself with the locals, of which there are few, as the fishing village of Hafjord is essentially one looped street by the sea. Knausgaard’s writing flows smoothly from memory to memory as he shifts backwards in time and tells the story of his last year of school and his graduation. As he attempts to fit in at a new school, begins to write record reviews for a local newspaper, and strives as hard as he can to have sex for the first time, Knausgaard makes these everyday difficulties fascinating through the fine lens with which he examines his own life.
In many ways, Knausgaard frames “Book Four” as a long battle against his own shame towards the goal of getting laid, a device that ties the sometimes disparate threads of the book, and of his life, into a unified, provocative, goal. “I wanted to sleep with a girl. That was the only thing I wanted.” Despite the unchaste nature of this quest, it’s easy to find oneself quite invested in this mission, lending the book a surprising page-turning quality. Although Karl Ove is portrayed as anything but suave, he seems to be handsome and have a certain magnetism with the girls, as he is never left wanting for long for romantic partners. No, his issue is that he suffers from premature ejaculation, an affliction that causes him no end of self-torment and drives him to shatter romantic entanglements before they can get too serious. While Karl Ove is often shown as an arrogant braggart, this almost comical weakness and Knausgaard's complete openness with discussing the low points of his youth make him into a rather sympathetic character.
The examples of love in Karl Ove's life are shaky at best, a theme that Knausgaard compellingly, if depressingly at times, uses to display the fickleness of attraction. While his parents may have started out well enough, his father becomes abusive as Karl Ove ages, and the elder Knausgaard splits from Karl Ove’s mother when he is sixteen. Moving in with a new girlfriend, Unni, his father desperately tries to reconnect with Karl Ove and his brother, apologizing for the mistakes of his past, but his burgeoning alcoholism and abrasive personality don’t allow for that. Despite his repeated allegations that he and Unni are happy, his other side continues to bubble up and shows that even relationships full of smiles can have their shadowy corners. Knausgaard's honesty when discussing his family's difficulties is at times painfully engaging, and watching the classic exploration of the difficult relationship between father, mother, and son is as compelling as always.
As the book continues, some of the most self-referential and interesting moments emerge, considering where Knausgaard has ended up in life. He cleverly shows the start of his own journey from small-time journalist to the author that he is today. In the midst of this, as the dark Norwegian winter descends upon Hafjord, Karl Ove takes shelter in his writing. Having hauled a typewriter up with him from the south, he sets about crafting short stories with a sense of extreme self-importance. These early works are not autobiographical, but they carry similar themes to those found in Knausgaard's life and those within the pages of “Book Four.” The moments of development are not strongly highlighted but offer a rare and fascinating insight into the process of becoming an, arguably, great writer.
“Book Four” is surprisingly plot-driven for a true story, and this is a testament to Knausgaard's ability to tie life’s messy events together seamlessly into an overarching tale. And it is truly a book about Karl Ove and no one else. Hundreds of pages pass concerning his family members, yet they remain fairly flat and lifeless. By description these are engaging characters: the father, a depressed alcoholic trying to hold onto his family, or the mother, trying to make up for the mistakes of her past while not letting her son run too wild. However, because the book lives entirely within the head of Karl Ove, these collected traits never develop into fully-fledged people that one can feel or understand. In the same way, all of Karl Ove's friends, love interests, fellow teachers, and students blend together indistinguishably. This, however, is less a glaring flaw and more a passing realization one may upon nearing the end of the book. The events Knausgaard relates gain a raw intensity from the fact that the tale is told solely from the perspective of Karl Ove, and this, combined with Knausgaard's flair for storytelling, makes “Book Four” into the excellent composition that it is.
There isn't really anything all that special about Karl Ove's struggles. Many people live through divorces, sexual frustration, growing pains, and the difficulties of not fitting in. But it is nonetheless fascinating to watch Knausgaard tease an engaging story out of the wreckage of his past. He uses the page to explore his transition from a record-hoarding horny teenager to the great writer that he is today, and his provocative writing will likely strike a resonant chord with many who have in their own way struggled with growing up.

Australian baritone Duncan Rock, a rising star in the opera world, has come to Boston to perform the eponymous lead in the Boston Lyric Opera’s production of Mozart’s “Don Giovanni,” which opens May 1. In a conversation with The Crimson, he discussed discovering opera, his personal take on “Don Giovanni,” and his thoughts on opera’s future.
The Harvard Crimson: How did you first come to opera?
Duncan Rock: I was at law school in West Australia and not really loving it. When I was in law school they encouraged a somewhat holistic approach to education, so you could pinch a couple of units from other faculties, and I pinched units in music…. The more I was doing law, the less, I realized, I liked it. And the more I was doing music, the more, I realized, I loved it. Then I won a scholarship to do my master’s degree in London at the Guildhall School of Music [and Drama] and jumped at the opportunity. That was in 2007, and I’ve not looked back since.
THC: What are your favorite moments from “Don Giovanni,” either to hear or to perform yourself?
DR: I’m afraid this is a cliché, but I really, really enjoy all of it. I was mocked quite heavily in a recent interview I gave by relating “Don Giovanni” to tofu. What I mean is that he’s sort of a chameleon character, and he takes on the flavor of the characters around him. I’m going to keep using the analogy; I think it’s quite accurate! Every scene that he sings is so different…. For example, at the very opening he’s in a fight with the character Donna Anna, and it’s extremely, extremely aggressive music, and then he goes on to argue with the Commendatore and murders him. But then halfway through Act II he sings the simplest, quietest, most beautiful serenade to seduce a young lady. So it’s a character that lives always in the extremes. There’s not really one scene that I particularly love, because they’re all so different.
THC: Don Giovanni is a dark character; when you’re playing that kind of role, do you try to rationalize his actions or do you just give yourself over to the part?
DR: I completely try to rationalize, so much so that I sometimes find myself saying things like “Oh, er, that’s not right.” It’s quite easy, particularly with an iconic character like Don Giovanni, to follow the archetype of the seducer or play him as just a pantomime villain…. But he’s just a person like anyone else. This is my sixth production of “Don Giovanni,” and I find myself liking him more and more, which is perhaps a slightly dangerous pathway to go down, but that’s what’s happening. At the heart of it all, he’s completely open and honest about what he wants from life, and he invites people or seduces people into his world, but he doesn’t force anyone into his world…. I think that’s quite important. I don’t see him as a bad guy, I just see him as different from all the characters around him.
THC: You’re part of this generation of opera singers that’s coming up in a culture that values innovation and avant-garde thought, and yet your artform relies heavily on tradition and classic technique. What do you think is the way forward for opera as it navigates between these two forces?
DR: In a way you’ve answered it in the question. It’s very, very important that when new technologies come along we’re able to embrace them, and when new ways of looking at a particular piece come along we’re able to embrace those as well. But I think it’s also really important to remember what makes opera special and unique. If opera tries to compete with film, it will never win. It needs to stay true to what it offers uniquely and specifically and quite beautifully, which is this combination of different artforms, this marriage of text and music with genius composition.
THC: Do you think that those singularities are why opera has had such lasting appeal?
DR: I say this because I experienced it myself as a young man at law school seeing my first opera; I remember that I saw “La Bohème,” by Puccini, and I was extremely poor because I was a student, and I had such a bad ticket that I couldn’t see the sur-title…. I could still tell what they were saying, although of course not the specifics since I didn’t speak Italian at the time, and I wondered, “How is it possible that I’m moved to tears by these people singing in a language that I don’t understand?” I think we have this really strong connection with the human voice and our hearts, if you want to call it that—with our emotions.
THC: When “Don Giovanni” opens in a few days, what do you hope audiences will take away from each performance?
DR: Such is the wonderful nature of opera that I hope different people take away different things. I hope some people will walk away saying, “Wow, those voices were really amazing,” and I hope other people go away saying, “That music is incredibly beautiful.” I guess the idea would be that people walk away having been really immersed and engaged in the story because of those things…. I hope people leave having understood and cared about the story, but then also have had the bonus of being blown away by the incredible orchestra and music.

Nick Kroll is not funny. Unfortunately, this is not the primary tragedy of “Adult Beginners.”  In director Ross Katz’s second feature, Kroll, of “Kroll Show” notoriety, plays a serious role. Not only is it hard to take him seriously—it is hard to care. Without his “Kroll Show” personas, Nick just is not a very interesting guy. What is more, the lack of inspiration in the film’s screenplay amplifies the overbearing blandness of the film’s leading man. Tired clichés alternate with jokes that fall flat, and the sleep-inducing result is a sort of Judd Apatow knock-off—a quirky family buddy movie stripped of all the humor and talent.
The backstory requires little explanation, as it is clear that the writers gave it little thought. The details are irrelevant: The audience is simply meant to understand that Jake (Kroll) is on top. He lives in a swanky Manhattan apartment, rubs shoulders with wealthy, suit-clad white guys, and makes out with pretty blondes in marble bathtubs. Due to a poor investment decision, however, he abruptly loses everything. One emotional train ride later, Jake is on the doorstep of his sister, Justine (Rose Byrne). Justine, a busy mother who teaches at a local school, allows Jake to stay with her on the condition that he babysit her son, Teddy (Caleb and Matthew Poddack), during the day. This is an arrangement that is sure to kill a whole flock of seagulls with just one stone: Justine and her husband Danny (Bobby Cannavale) save money on daycare, Jake gets a place to stay, and—most importantly—Jake gets the dose of reality he so sorely needs.
Unfortunately, reality has its problems, too. Behind the innocent picket fences of Justine’s neighborhood lies an Updikean web of adultery, deception, and regret. And yet, the writers dig no deeper into this web than the commuter belt clichés. They hit all the midlife crisis film tropes but fail to develop the beyond their barest form. Still, admirable performances by Byrne and Cannavale salvage their otherwise dull setting. Byrne, for her part, manages to be both poignant and funny. She is relatable as a mother who has stretched herself too thin, and she delivers her exhausted musings convincingly. Cannavale is an oafish contractor whose amiable, boyish demeanor provides a refreshing complement to those of the more serious characters in the film. Byrne and Cannavale do the “cool couple” shtick very well, and, even if their marriage is deadly close to falling apart, one cannot shake the feeling that they would make great guests at a neighborhood barbecue.
Kroll’s character, however, possesses few redemptive qualities. From the beginning of the film until the final minutes, Jake is a jerk. He is not a jerk who is secretly likeable or a jerk who is misunderstood; he genuinely just does not have any positive qualities. His selfishness is what drives him into his rut, and this selfishness continues when he moves in with his sister. Moreover, Kroll plays the character with such malaise that it is difficult to believe that Jake ever had any success in the first place.
The film’s title comes from a swim class that Jake and Justine take with Teddy during the film. Never taught how to swim by his emotionally neglectful parents, Jake is offered a spot in the adult beginners course. The course is probably a lazy metaphor for his inability to act like a real adult, and Jake refuses it. But in the film’s climax, when swim instructor Miss Jenn (Jane Krakowski) informs Jake and Justine that Teddy will not jump in the water unless they do so first, the two must conquer their fears and take the plunge. As rhey submerge their heads in the water and the adorable Teddy joins them, they finally make one big happy family.
This is sweet. Sweet like a shot of crude oil saturated with Splenda. With so many deep-seated problems in this family, it seems dubious to suggest that this group baptism will cleanse them of their sins, but the light-hearted music that accompanies the credit reel seems to suggest just that. Like its peer films, “Adult Beginners” takes a whole lot of family clichés, stirs the pot with a contrived crisis, and serves the product neatly on a platter in under 90 minutes. What makes the film exceptional in its class is that it is not even fun. What few drops of enjoyment may have existed in this script prior to shooting are sucked out by Kroll’s vampiric lethargy, and all that remains is the film’s lifeless corpse.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rather unusually, all eyes were not on Yo-Yo Ma ’76 last Friday, April 24, as the world-famous cellist drew bow across string during a sold-out concert that evening in Sanders Theatre. Instead, the audience’s attention was focused on the diverse group of individuals and instruments surrounding the 18-time Grammy Award winner. One musician, Nicholas D. Cords, held a viola; a second, Man Wu, strummed a pipa, or Chinese lute; a third, Sandeep Das, beat his hands on the percussive Indian tabla. The musicians were members of the Silk Road Ensemble, a world music group formed by Ma in 2000 with the intent to promote cross-cultural understanding through music.
Friday’s concert set out to achieve that very goal with its eleven pieces—three of which the Silk Road Ensemble had never before performed in public—spanning a wide array of heritages. Despite the group’s Asianic name, the concert engaged with traditions from all around the world, with works rooted in cultures ranging from Syrian to Finnish. “We certainly have melodies that have their basis in the Silk Road,” says Cords, who was involved in programming the concert. “But we also have pieces on the program that are coming from Spain, Americana traditions, Africa—places you wouldn’t necessarily associate with the Silk Road.”
The Silk Road Ensemble has performed and led workshops at Harvard multiple times in the past, an outgrowth of their status as artists in residence since 2005. “Harvard is kind of home to us…and when you’re home, I think you can take certain risks that you might not take other places,” Cords says of the group’s close association with the University.
When asked how Friday’s concert differs from those the Silk Road Ensemble has held at Harvard in the past, Wu points to student involvement. “We normally hold workshops, but this particular Friday’s concert, we actually have students onstage with us,” she says. Undergraduates Shuya Gong ’17, Sumire Hirotsuru ’16, and Martine K. Thomas ’18 appeared onstage with the Silk Road Ensemble for the concert’s opening and concluding pieces, while Reylon A. Yount ’16 played a Chinese ethnic dance with Wu and percussionist Haruka Fujii. Senior George A. Meyer ’15 also premiered an original arrangement of the American traditional tune “Buffalo Skinners” with the group.
“There are a couple of things on this program we’ve never done before,” Cords agrees prior to the concert. “I think it’s going to be fun. But if we crash and burn, we know we’re in a friendly environment…. We’re in a place of learning here.”
Last Monday, Das participated in a panel discussion on navigating different cultures with fellow Silk Road Ensemble members Cristina Pato, Joseph Gramley, and Hadi Eldebek, along with Steven Seidel, director of the Arts in Education program at the Graduate School of Education. Das has sat on a number of similar panels in the past while teaching at the Harvard Summer Institute. “Honestly, once I’m done with my part of the teaching—what little I can do…it’s a huge learning experience, where we’re learning from the students and the other faculty,” he says of the panels.
Indeed, Das, Wu, and Cords all assent that playing in the Silk Road Ensemble has allowed them to engage in and learn through the same cross-cultural contacts that the group advocates for its audience. “You grow up doing one thing well and thinking this is how the world is. It’s only once you meet people from other cultures—be it musical or otherwise—that you realize that there are ways of looking at the same thing differently,” Das says. “That has had an impact on all of us.”
“I think a lot of it is…the personal relationships that have been forged in the group,” Cords adds. “I’ve seen this group grow from a collection of strangers to a pretty vibrant creative cauldron, and I think that sends that message out into the world more strongly because we’re doing it ourselves.” But the underlying goal is larger than the group itself, the members note. “I’d…be totally open to the idea that some student at Harvard could create something much better than what we have,” Cords says when asked about the possibility of a student group modeled on the Silk Road Ensemble.
“It takes time. But someone has to do it…. Every year we’re [playing concerts], and the students [and] faculty will get it in their heads,” Wu says.
“You hold the torch for a while,” Cords agrees. “But it’s actually a great moment when you can see that torch going somewhere else—and in a better and greater way than you could have imagined.”

“Imagination is not only the uniquely human capacity to envision that which is not,” J. K. Rowling said to Harvard’s class of 2008, a group of millennials she called “the world’s largest Gryffindor reunion.” Fourteen at the time, I was in front of the section where members of the Class of 1948 sat in their wheelchairs and bright crimson hats, staring at my hero, the woman who wrote the “Harry Potter” books. J. K. Rowling continued speaking, and I drank in her every word. “In its arguably most transformative and revelatory capacity, [imagination] is the power that enables us to empathize with humans whose experiences we have never shared.”
I was then just at the age where I saw myself in every character in every book I picked up. Rowling had it right—imagination led me to understand the challenges of a girl warrior in Tamora Pierce’s “The Song of the Lioness” books, the bravado of Ponyboy Curtis’s older brother in S.E. Hinton’s novel “The Outsiders,” and the parched, sweltering experience of Stanley Yelnats in Louis Sachar’s novel “Holes.” The books I read begged me to enter into another life. I learned empathy from these books, as Rowling suggested in her commencement address.
My experience is not unlike that of my peers. Our generation grew up during a boom in books published for children and young adults, and as we have aged, academic interest in the field of children’s literature has also increased. This trend exists at Harvard too, with approximately 600 students lotterying for Germanic languages and literatures professor Maria Tatar’s class Folklore and Mythology 90i: “Fairy Tales and Fantasy Literature” in February 2013. In Boston in particular, the world of children’s literature is flourishing. Simmons College has a Master of Arts program in Children’s Literature, which many students combine with a Masters of Fine Arts degree in Writing for Children. Candlewick Press, a children’s book publishing company founded in Massachusetts in 1991 and currently based in Somerville, has grown to publish and distribute books on three continents.
But what has caused an increased academic and business interest in children’s literature? Why should we care about picture books, and what is the proper way to take apart and examine a story written for children? Are children’s books uniquely written to help us “empathise with humans whose experiences we have never shared,” as Rowling said?
“We are living in a post-‘Harry Potter’, post-‘Hunger Games,’ post-‘Divergent’ world,” Simmons professor Cathryn Mercier says. Mercier—who currently directs Simmons’s Center for the Study of Children's Literature and the graduate degree programs in Children's Literature and Writing for Children—is sitting in her office at Simmons, surrounded by shelves filled with picture books and thicker YA novels.
What does it mean to live in a post-“Harry Potter” world? The playing field has changed, Mercier says. More people are writing fantasy books, and older children—even young adults as well as a new intra-industry category of college-age readers called the “New Adult” group—are reading them.
Karen Lotz ’87, president and publisher at Candlewick Press since 1999, says that she notices a similar boom in writing for young people. “We are living in a bit of a golden age,” Lotz says. “The writing that is going on in our field is of superior quality…. It’s very caring and painstaking.”
Working in children’s literature for many years, Lotz has seen her world change. She says that, recently, adults have been more interested in children’s literature and suggests that the e-reader contributes to why adults continue to read books marketed for children; they are easier to download and read quickly, and there is less of a commitment involved when the book is on an e-reader. But, according to a Pew Research Center study on e-book consumption, compared to the way adults choose to read, the e-reader has not changed the publishing world of children’s literature quite as much; younger readers and parents of new readers still prefer print books.
The increased adult interest in YA and children’s books also means that writers publish more reviews in major media outlets. For children’s literature, which, Lotz says, is perhaps a more review-based business than adult fiction, the careful and professional reviews have kept children’s literature honest, original, and of high quality. Adults review the books, and adults also choose what children are reading. It is the adult author who depicts childhood on the page and expects the young reader to accept that version and even to identify with the child characters. Mercier says that this type of relationship represents an imbalance of power. It is the publishers who shape the genre, and it is the publishers who decide which kinds of stories are marketed at certain age groups. In order to approach the children’s book in an academic context, then, Mercier says that it is important sometimes to separate the audience, the marketing process, and the reviews from the book itself. “We try to look at the books and not the reader,” Mercier says.
“I have to have some hypothetical of what the reader might be,” children’s book author Uma Krishnaswami said to a room full of school teachers, librarians, and booksellers. “I don’t always think that’s the case for adult books.” Krishnaswami was speaking at the “What’s New in Children’s Literature” morning conference at Lesley University on April 11. The conference was organized by Wondermore, an organization focused on bringing children’s books and their authors into underserved K-8 schools in Boston, according to its website. For Krishnaswami, reminding herself about the young readers of children’s books is important to her craft. But this approach begs the question: does a writer have to consider the reader when she is creating a story for children?
“Stories, for children, are both a mirror and a window,” children’s book author Dana Alison Levy says. According to Levy, child readers see themselves in the characters in their books and want to live through the characters who exist within worlds entirely different from their own. Levy’s theory is not unlike the one Rowling raised during her commencement address.
But learning about worlds different from one’s own depends not only on elements of escape but also on understanding the experiences of children who come from different backgrounds. “We Need Diverse Books,” a campaign started in April 2014, for example, seeks to promote diversity children’s books. Through social media campaigns, awards, and festivals, the group encourages readers, publishers, and authors to support a variety of literary characters, “including (but not limited to) LGBTQIA, people of color, gender diversity, people with disabilities, and ethnic, cultural, and religious minorities,” according to its mission statement. Levy is the author of “The Misadventures of the Family Fletcher,” a realistic novel for middle-grade readers, a term in the publishing business for children reading at a middle school level. “The Misadventures of Family Fletcher” made waves in the children’s lit scene last summer  because of its humor—various references to cat barf, ice rinks in the backyard, and the everyday follies of growing up—and because of its depiction of a family with four adopted sons and two dads. Even though Levy says that she does not draw from her own family experiences when she writes about what it is like to live with gay parents and adopted children, she does not see this as a barrier or an excuse. “Not writing books with diverse characters because you’re not of that demographic—that’s a cop-out,” Levy said at the “What’s New in Children’s Literature” conference.
Krishnaswami also says that she believes in the importance of emphasizing diversity in fiction. “I read a lot by British writers who were dead,” she says of her own reading experience. “I wasn’t British and I certainly wasn’t dead. So I didn’t know I could write books.” When Krishnaswami eventually picked up a pen, she wrote about India and America, the land of her childhood and her adult life, respectively. “I was reaching for a different kind of story, where [the protagonist’s] identity is not the issue…where her non-hyphenated American friend could be a Bollywood fan,” she says.
“The Problem with Being Slightly Heroic,” one of Krishnaswami’s books, follows a young girl who has to handle a Bollywood actress let loose in the United States. As Krishnaswami reads an excerpt—in which the girl-protagonist watches the movie star navigate Washington, D.C. and its world of adults—the adults in the room chuckle, causing Krishnaswami to pause. “Children’s stories are about getting a grip,” Krishnashwami says wisely. “Adult stories are about letting go.”
Children and adults may look for different things in the books that they read. To that end, Carol Stoltz, the children’s book buyer and manager at Porter Square Books, an independent bookstore in Cambridge, constantly has to make decisions about which books belong in her section of the store. “The storyline often has a protagonist that is a young person so the readers can identify with whom they are reading about,” Stolz says. “The language is probably less sophisticated…. There is usually more action. It’s unusual to find a children’s book where you are just reading about atmosphere.”
Lotz also bumps into boundaries when trying to separate adult fiction from children’s literature. “I would put the determining factor as the age of the protagonist,” Lotz says, trying to categorize the reading audience. If the main character in the story is 10 years old, for example, then the book likely will be published and marketed as a book for middle-grade readers, according to Lotz.
Gregory Maguire, author of the “Wicked” series (targeted at adults) as well as many books for children, takes a different approach to the question of genre. He says that he does not have a preference about the age of his readers. “Who are my books for?” Maguire asked rhetorically at the conference. “I don’t really care. My books are for people who like to read Gregory Maguire books.” Maguire added that his books have themes pertinent for all ages. His most recent book, “Egg & Spoon,” discusses inequality in a semi-fantastical, semi-historical world. Maguire described  this world as similar to Russia in 1907, except everything is melting. Though his publisher has placed “Egg & Spoon” in the children’s market, the book is about 200 pages longer than another book he has in the works, which he plans to release for adults.
Even though Maguire most often writes about fantastical worlds with green witches and unfaithful wizards (indeed, he calls himself a “fantacist”), he acknowledges the universal questions that pervade his writing for both children and adults. The only difference, according to Maguire, is that the books that children read are often more fun. Krishnaswami too speaks about the energy with which she imbues her characters and plots. “Children are the ultimate eccentrics,” Krishnaswami says. “If we keep that in mind, we can’t go wrong."
Especially when considering picture books, readers are adamant in their views concerning the print-versus-electronic debate. For some children, the tactile experience of running their hands over the face of a page and turning pages is part of the pleasure of reading. Rather than the children readers, then, it is the illustrators who are now confronting the trend toward incorporating digital media into their work. Illustrators used to spend more time than they do now creating the art on each page of a picture book, Mercier says. There were several layers of images for a single illustrated page, and each layer corresponded to a different color that would appear in print. Now, with the ease and artistry of digital drawing, picture books have gained new life.
While speaking about the art of illustrated children’s books, Mercier pulls out a large picture book from a teetering stack next to her. The book, “The Iridescence of Birds: A Book About Henri Matisse,” contains brightly colored pages and is a story about the painter’s boyhood in northern France. Mercier says that she might use “The Iridescence of Birds” in one of her classes because of the illustrator’s characteristic style and intentional mimicry of Matisse’s paintings. She also says that she appreciates the text of the book, the placement of text on the page, the pace of the story’s words, and the timing of each page turn. Author, illustrator, and designer thus work together to create a reading experience for the adult and the child.
Charlotte W. Robinson, an adjunct lecturer on education at Harvard’s Graduate School of Education, says that she values the performative aspect of reading a picture book aloud. Robinson has a background in graphic design, and, among other careers, was at one time a preschool teacher. She says that her experience of reading to a class of two-year-olds made clear the importance of the layout and pacing of a given book. “For me, looking at a picture book…is very similar to looking at a musical score,” Robinson says. “The book really hasn’t reached its potential until it has performed, once it is shared with an adult and the child.”
Robinson also spoke about the interaction between the artwork and the text in books meant to be read aloud to children. In that situation, the listening child likely does not yet know how to read, and so the look of the typeface—weather it is bold or squiggly or larger—is an indication to the adult as to how [HE OR] she should read the text. And, Robinson adds, it is important that the text and the pictures each tell a different story.
“There are some cases where the text is acting as an unreliable narrator, and then the art is showing you what’s really happening,” Robinson says. This tension between artwork and text is not present in picture books intended for early readers. In those books for early readers, text and pictures are meant to depict the same concepts so that the pictures can act as clues for young readers trying to decipher the semantics of a set of words on the page, according to Robinson.
“The Horn Book Magazine,” based in Boston since 1924, is a national periodical that reviews children’s literature. Published bimonthly, it features short reviews for a variety of children’s books as well as young adult literature. The process of reviewing children’s literature is one sort of conundrum that those involved in studying and publishing children’s literature have to consider. Questions may arise since the intended audience, children, are not the people who write the reviews, make publishing decisions, or even buy the books for libraries and bookstores. That is why, according to Mercier, it is important to understand the context of the books written for young people. Reading and analyzing children’s books can reveal the way that society constructs childhood, or the ideal childhood, she says.
In recent years, interest in the academic component of children’s literature has grown. When Lotz, Mercier, Stoltz, and Robinson were in college, there often was only one course in the study of children’s literature—or sometimes none at all. In Boston today, however, there are several “Writing for Children” masters programs, including at Lesley University and Simmons College. The Boston Book Festival, a free and annual celebration of reading, also has special events featuring children’s book authors and publishers. In addition, in the last few years, Harvard has offered more classes on the study of childhood and literature. “Over the past decade, I have taken note of a variety of courses in the English Department and in the Freshman Seminar Program that include texts ranging from the Harry Potter series to ‘Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,’” Tatar says. And the choice to have Rowling speak at Commencement reflects the prevalence of children’s literature at the College.
In Massachusetts, children’s literature abounds. The official children’s book of the commonwealth is Robert McCloskey’s classic “Make Way for Ducklings,” a story whose bird protagonists have brass statues in their image in Boston Commons. A popular city myth purports that the grave of “Mother Goose” lies in Boston’s Granary Burial Ground. And Louisa May Alcott, author of “Little Women,” lived her whole life in nearby Concord, where her house still stands as a historical museum. Indeed, the city of Boston is steeped in children’s literature and remains a fruitful place for children’s literature writing, publishing, and scholarship to grow.
But publishers, book buyers, and academics have various ideas about whether or not Boston is particularly receptive to children’s literature. Mercier, for her part, cites the prevalence of universities in the city as a reason that there are more than the average number programs devoted to the study of children’s literature. Robinson says that Boston may be less intimidating to publishers than New York and that the “not-New-Yorkness” of the place allows their companies to take more risks. Lotz said that there are a large number of independent bookstores in the area, including Porter Square Books, Harvard Square Book Store, Raven Used Books, and Trident Booksellers & Cafe, in addition to Brookline Booksmith and The Curious George Store, which focus solely on children’s literature.
Whatever the role of this particular city in the study and production of books for children and young people, one thing that stuck from conversations with children’s literature experts is the need for imagination and enthusiasm while writing, publishing, teaching, or reading books written for children. “Playing in the backyard is the beginning of writing,” Maguire, who lives in Massachusetts, says. “Dreaming and having a nightmare and knowing you can survive it is the beginning of writing.” That enthusiasm for stories starts in childhood and continues for those who love children’s literature. It can happen anywhere in the world, but Boston seems especially primed to foster stories for young people.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Friday, Harvard welcomed British pop star Jessie J to Harvard’s yearly spring concert, Yardfest. The contrast between the excitement surrounding Yardfest and an average Harvard weekend is noteworthy. Even as many of us are sinking under the weight of papers, problem sets, and final projects—and dreading the exams that are on the horizon—we as a community still found the time and energy to go out and celebrate.
Why isn’t it always like that?
It is easy and altogether too frequent for our balance between work and fun to become skewed here, and for social events to become—e­ither by accident or design—exclusive and closed to certain members of the community. Yardfest is, by nature, an event that exists for all of Harvard, and thus it ought to serve as a model for improvements to Harvard’s social scene. It is an event that is open to all, exemplified by its commendable of support of student musician groups, alongside more established acts. While ordinarily, social life at Harvard is divided, by house, by club membership, or sometimes by lack of physical accessibility, Yardfest is one of the few opportunities every year when we as a community have an opportunity to celebrate and have fun together with no exceptions. The only barrier to entry is a Harvard ID; the only club membership required is the one we have all received.
Events like Yardfest, or the Harvard-Yale game—the other annual occasion of campus-wide revelry—serve both as a means of unifying the entire student body and as a symbol of what we as a community are missing when we divide ourselves into smaller, more exclusive units. There is an argument to be made that we appreciate these events more because of the lack of frequency, but it misses the point: It is sad that we need either a British pop star giving us a pep talk or a common enemy in the form of Yale to truly come together as a community.
It is vitally important, then, that we not wait for these events to come to us; rather, we should seek them out, create them ourselves, and build a community not based on interests, club membership, or house affiliation—a community that really reflects Harvard. We have seen that we are capable of that at Yardfest, at Harvard-Yale, and at a handful of other Harvard-wide events. But otherwise, we tend to fall into a comfortable routine, spending time within a set of a narrow boundaries—with our blockmates, at stein clubs, or among members of the same teams or clubs. There can be no doubt that the workload here—academically, athletically, and otherwise—can be burdensome, but the examples of Yardfest and The Game show that we are able to put all that aside every once in a while. We ought to do that more often.
In a way, it is perhaps fortunate that Yardfest and Visitas happened over the same weekend this year; those pre-frosh who choose to attend Harvard will have the opportunity to help affect such change on Harvard’s campus. We hope that current students will do the same.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I first arrived at Harvard not knowing if I wanted to be here at all. Unlike many accepted students, Harvard had never been my dream. Growing up, I saw myself attending Georgetown, living in Washington, D.C., and perhaps one day working as a speechwriter for a political campaign. But when my Harvard acceptance arrived, everything changed. Like many students, I felt that the offer was too good to pass up. I knew that if I didn’t attend Harvard, I would spend the rest of my life qualifying every conversation or job interview with the fact that I had been accepted, but turned the offer down.
After arriving on Harvard’s campus, I immediately regretted my decision. I felt out-of-place, intellectually inferior, and discouraged when my interests didn’t align with any of the new friends I had made. A few months into freshman year, I considered transferring to Georgetown. I missed the comfort of the small Catholic community in which I had grown up, where “Republican” had a positive connotation, and where everyone looked the same and held the same beliefs as I did.
Fortunately, I was either too scared or too stubborn to give up on the Harvard experience. Whichever the case may have been, I am thankful every day that I made the decision to stay.
Harvard has taught me so much. It has instructed me on topics ranging from Ovid’s influence on Shakespeare to theories of sexuality to the chemical composition of a chocolate soufflé. It has helped me to learn a language, write a novel, and pursue a career in journalism.
What I am most indebted to Harvard for, however, has little to do with my instruction inside the classroom. Above all, I credit Harvard for helping me to become a more socially and culturally responsible human being. I remember a time when I used to thumb through college pamphlets and the word “diversity” meant little to me. Thanks to Harvard, that is no longer the case.
What I realize now, and what I failed to realize back then, is that the more people you meet who are different from you, the more aware you become. As the product of a white Catholic community, there were certain injustices that I could not even fathom until I got to Harvard. Here, I received an education that could never be taught in the halls of a Jesuit school like Georgetown, where the majority of students resemble those I had grown up with my entire life.
Harvard forced me to befriend people with whom I had little in common, to have difficult conversations about race, politics, and religion, and ultimately to challenge my beliefs, thereby strengthening them in the process.
But lest you jump to the conclusion that Harvard is a shining beacon of social justice and political correctness, I’d like to end my final column with a few thoughts on how the university could improve in the future.
To start with the obvious, we have an exclusivity problem here at Harvard. Nearly every extracurricular organization requires an audition, an application, or some sort of qualification for acceptance. To all those Harvard students out there who may be reading this column, I ask you to consider this: The world is too exclusive for us to be impeding our own opportunities.
The world is also too patriarchal, too heteronormative, and too racially insensitive for us to be reinforcing those hegemonies within our social spaces. We need to consider who defines our social scene and why this may be the case. When we encounter the kind of elitism for which we have been heavily criticized and stereotyped, we must resist it, and make a concerted effort to carve out spaces where inclusivity is pervasive. If we can develop paradigm-shifting social networks and revolutionary chemotherapy drugs, I have no doubt that this is a feasible goal for the future.
But above all, we need to dispense with the competition.
At my freshman convocation, Dean Michael D. Smith used one simple phrase to tell the Class of 2015 all they needed know about succeeding in a competitive environment: “Don’t compare, connect.”  It was the first lesson I learned at Harvard, and it is the lesson I hope to leave my readers.
As Harvard students, we are told over and over again that we are privileged to be part of an institution with infinite resources and educational opportunities, and this is certainly true. But we are far more privileged to be in the company of passionate, driven, and extraordinary individuals who can teach us so much about the world in which we live. In the future, let us strive to be their advocates and not their competitors.
Let us also strive to be grateful for this opportunity we have be given, while keeping in mind that Harvard does not define us as human beings. It may be an important part of who we are, but Harvard does not dictate or determine who we will become. That part is up to us, and it is my firm belief that Harvard has given us the impetus to become the most conscientious, informed, and charitable versions of ourselves. Despite whatever reason may have compelled us to attend this college, Harvard’s gift to us is much more than a name—it’s a call to action.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I still remember freshman orientation, when the Office of Student Life had us all bond with our entryways by sending us on a dorky scavenger hunt through Harvard’s plethora of campus resources, from the Bureau of Study Counsel to the Office of Career Services to Room 13. In the Women’s Center, my friends and I giggled awkwardly at the rainbow condoms and joked about a brochure entitled “Pregnant At Harvard?” I never dreamed that it would be relevant to my life. And yet two and a half years later, I walked sobbing out of a clinic in Boston after having an abortion.
Okay. Rewind needed.
When I came to Harvard, I was very much the stereotypical Harvard freshman. I fit in well with the high school student body presidents, star soccer players, first violinists, and newspaper editor-in-chiefs. I’d never done drugs. The most I’d ever had to drink was a glass of champagne with my parents. I had a steady boyfriend of two years. Life wasn’t picture-perfect; it never is. But mine was almost scarily wholesome.
College was a whole new world in so many ways. I drank for the first time. I partied every weekend. My adoringly sweet high school boyfriend and I broke up right around Thanksgiving of freshman year. But I had a social life, good grades, and exciting extracurriculars.
And soon after, I fell in love with a boy who was perfect for me—the type of soulmate that everyone dreams of finding at Harvard. He was my intellectual equal and shared both my romance and my quirky sense of humor. And he made me feel crazily and unquestioningly in love. We could spend hours working on problem sets or hours tearing up a dance floor, we finished each other’s jokes, and we could look at each other and know exactly what the other person was thinking. More than that, we understood each other in a way that no one else ever had. He told me he wanted to marry me. The feeling was mutual, and I eventually ended up losing my virginity to him. Like life, relationships aren’t ever perfect. But we were the type of relationship that everyone wanted to have.
This past fall, something changed. We started having arguments about every little thing. I would say “I love you,” and then get angry and then confused and then sad. I still loved him, but something felt overwhelmingly different and I didn’t know how to express it in words. Eventually, he’d had it. He told me that I wasn’t the girl he fell in love with, and he broke up with me.
I spent weeks sobbing about losing the love of my life, the one person who had promised to always be there for me. I couldn’t eat, I couldn’t sleep, and I couldn’t concentrate. I didn’t know what was wrong with me. I eventually started having strange nightmares and vomiting up random foods. I realized I had skipped a period that should’ve happened before the breakup. But even then, I thought my sadness was the underlying cause.
Looking back, it seems obvious that my symptoms were classic pregnancy indicators, clues we all learn in ninth-grade health class. I wasn’t stupid. But perhaps I was in denial.
Even after two more missed periods, I still hadn’t realized that my ever-changing feelings were hormonally induced mood swings, that the vomiting was morning sickness, and that the changes to my body were a pregnant glow. It wasn’t until I was getting dressed and noticed a visible stomach bump in the mirror that I finally came to terms with the truth.
I took two pregnancy tests, just to be certain. I spent the night by myself, crying. The very next day, I skipped class and went to an abortion clinic, where I officially learned that I was almost four months pregnant. My ex-boyfriend had apparently broken up with a girl who was a month and a half pregnant with his child.
All I desperately wanted was to have my boyfriend back. I wanted him to hold me and let me cry into his chest, for him to tell me that everything was okay even though it wasn’t. But by the time I found out the truth, it was too late to get him back. He had started dating another girl two months after we broke up. I couldn’t tell him. I couldn’t tell anyone.
So I called the clinic and made an appointment for a week’s time. That week was the hardest of my entire life. I hid underneath baggy sweaters, convinced that someone would notice how round my stomach had gotten. I was pale and withdrawn, and skipped almost every class to cry in my bedroom. I woke up every day praying that I was having some extended nightmare. I wasn’t.
I headed to the clinic a week later with just a book, a water bottle, my Harvard ID, and a locket containing a picture of my ex-boyfriend and me. The procedure didn’t take long. It wasn’t even that physically painful. But when it was over, I screamed. I couldn’t stop screaming. As I write these words, it has been over a month since the abortion—and on the inside that screaming hasn’t stopped.
This isn’t Mean Girls—I’m not going to tell you, “Don’t have sex. You will get pregnant, and you will die.” But what I will say is that, yes, there are nights when I wish I could die, when I look in the mirror and hate myself with every fiber of my being. There are nights where I stay up holding the locket, the one piece I have of both my ex-boyfriend and my child, and just cry hysterically. There are nights where I try so hard to convince myself that life is worthwhile by talking myself to sleep with thoughts of stargazing and dancing and laughter, but no matter what I think about I can’t get rid of an all-encompassing sense of pain.
And part of what makes it so hard is there is no one to help me deal with that pain. I wish that I had support. I wish that someone would tell me I’m not a horrible person for making the choice that I did, or say that they sympathize with my agony. But I can’t tell anyone, even my family, about my abortion or my child. I did end up telling my ex-boyfriend. I wanted him to realize that we’d never actually been broken. I sobbed into his chest and confessed everything. I told him about my guilt and my pain. He still didn’t take me back. He told me to tell him if anything was seriously wrong, but he didn’t support me when I needed him and reached out for help. Maybe now I’m just too messed up for him, or anyone else, to deal with.
It is frightening how hard it can be to find support at Harvard. I was shocked by how easy it was to hide my pregnancy. No one, not even my roommates or best friends, noticed how I suddenly started wearing exclusively baggy clothing, or how I kept cancelling plans last minute so I could cry in my room. No one noticed that I was vomiting on a near-daily basis, though I passed it off as “a winter bug” for weeks on end.
We’ve talked before about how here at school, we’re so wrapped up in our own lives that we forget to pay attention to others. We ignore the little signals from our friends that something could be amiss, even if we don’t realize that we’re doing it. I think I truly wanted someone to notice that something was wrong. I wanted someone to ask if I was okay, to tell me that I wasn’t acting like myself—because, really, I wasn’t.
We know there are a million campus resources, no matter what you’re going through. But sometimes when you can’t see a light at the end of the day, actively reaching out is impossible to do. You want someone to come to you.
And it’s easier to take the issue and shove it under the rug. I’ve tried to cope with my situation by distracting myself with other boys; my ex uses his current girlfriend to pretend that everything is normal. Sometimes reality is too hard to deal with, and finding any escape seems like the only plausible option. This—telling my story—is a way to say that no matter what you’re going through, even if you can’t reach out for help at this point, you’re not the only one. You are not alone.
If you saw me today, you’d never guess what I’m hiding. You’d see me heading to class with an oversized backpack, or studying in Lamont, or dancing at a final club, or laughing in the dining hall while surrounded by friends. I look happy. But on the inside, I’m still screaming. The odds of getting pregnant while engaging in the safe sex that my boyfriend and I engaged in are one in a million. Then again, so are the odds of getting into Harvard.
I wonder if that “Pregnant At Harvard?” brochure is still sitting untouched in the Women’s Center. Maybe I should’ve picked it up freshman year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 27, 2015, at 9:25 p.m.
A visit from Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who spoke about his reform agenda and the importance of stable U.S.-Japan relations at the Institute of Politics, was met with student protest on Monday morning.
The John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum event, moderated by Kennedy School professor and Order of the Rising Sun honoree Joseph S. Nye Jr., was one of Abe’s first stops in his weeklong tour of the United States, which is aimed at further strengthening economic and military ties between the two nations. Abe visited the site of the Boston Marathon bombings before his address on Monday and is scheduled to give an address before a joint session of Congress—the first for a Japanese leader—on Wednesday.
Abe’s remarks were preceded by an approximately hour-long silent demonstration organized by Harvard students that, according to an open letter read at the protest, protested his government’s “direct role in operating a system of sexual slavery during World War II.” Eighteen Harvard student groups and 161 students signed the open letter, which demanded an acknowledgment of the “Japanese government’s direct involvement in the operation of comfort stations.” Abe has come under fire for his historical revisionism and attempts by the Japanese government as recently as this January to edit passages in U.S.-published textbooks about World War II and Japanese military brothels.
“When it comes to the comfort women issue, my heart aches when I think about those people who were victimized by human trafficking and were subject to immeasurable pain and suffering,” Abe, speaking Japanese, said during the IOP address according to a live translation. Abe noted that he has chosen to uphold the 1993 Kono Statement expressing “remorse” for the military’s involvement in sexual slavery. “In the 20th century, we have seen history where once conflict arises, women’s human rights and honor are deeply wounded—we had such a history,” Abe added.
Demonstration organizer Claudine S. Cho ’15 expressed frustration with Abe’s statement.
“I am a Korean woman—definitely part of that just hit me stronger, because you can see your face and your body in these pictures of these women who suffered so much,” Cho said, emphasizing that she had contacted the Office of Student Life, the Harvard University Police Department, the Cambridge Police Department, and others to ensure that the demonstration was respectful. “It seems like [Abe’s] words don’t match his actions—he says he upholds the Kono statement, yet he promotes a revisionist history.”
Abe’s remarks also focused on the challenges of implementing large reforms that deplete political capital, asserting that despite the fact that historically most administrations have only been able to “deal with at most one or two reform agendas that are meaningful,” he had “tenaciously engineered a succession” of reforms aimed at individual empowerment, human security, and gender equality.
“Reform never comes without resistance. There will always be pressure from society to suppress it,” Abe said. “Still, once you have reached a decision, of course after having given it rigorous thought, you must carry through on it.”
Abe was re-elected as Prime Minister in 2012, having served previously as Prime Minister from 2006 to 2007. His second term came after a string of five brief prime ministerships in Japan since 2007.
“For many years, American policymakers in Washington would complain that they couldn’t remember the name of the Japanese prime minister, because it changed every six to twelve months,” Nye said when introducing Abe. “No longer. Everybody in Washington knows the name Shinzo Abe.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just months away from rolling out its first-ever honor code, the College hosted an event Monday where panelists addressed questions about the potential efficacy of the code as well as concerns about the impending affirmation of integrity mandate.
Several of the undergraduate members of the Honor Council, the student-faculty body that will hear cases of academic integrity starting next fall, attended the event as audience members. The non-undergraduate constituency of the body is yet to be named. Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana will appoint the remaining members of the Council—faculty, administrators, and teaching fellows—this summer, according to a handout distributed at the event. The full membership will be announced in August, according to the same document.
The event, which attracted more than 50 attendees, featured two undergraduate panelists, Carlton E. I. Christian ’17 and Olivia Z. Zhu ’15, as well as Chemistry professor Eric N. Jacobsen and Ann Marie E. Sousa, an administrator in the Office of Undergraduate Education. All but Christian are members of the Academic Integrity Committee, which designed the Honor Code that the Faculty of Arts and Sciences approved last May and will go into effect next semester.
Khurana and Brett Flehinger, the current secretary of the Administrative Board and soon-to-be secretary of the Honor Council, opened the event by extolling the work that students, faculty, and administrators have put into the honor code before moving to an open question and answer period.
Several undergraduates in the audience questioned the efficacy of the honor code in fostering a cultural change around academic integrity at the College, which administrators and students working on the code have frequently referenced as a goal.
Other undergraduates criticized the honor code’s affirmation of integrity statement, which the FAS passed in early April. Beginning next fall, undergraduates will be required to affirm their awareness of the honor code at the beginning of each term, before exams or final papers, and at the discretion of individual professors. Freshmen will also be required to write a personal response reflecting on the significance of the honor code in their lives.
Undergraduate Council Representative William A. Greenlaw ’17 said he worried that undergraduates may quickly affirm their awareness without necessarily valuing the honor code’s ideals. Henry Burnam ’16 argued that the design of the affirmation of integrity was “very dangerous” to a perceived mission of a liberal arts education to question authority and the “normalization” of “dogma.”
“It reinforces structures of power while failing to actually address the problem at hand,” Burnam said, later adding that requiring undergraduates to reflect on the honor code was “an essentially meaningless activity.”
Sousa, in response, said the affirmation of the integrity was not the only aspect of the honor code, and added that Harvard Business School affiliates will be conducting additional research on the affirmation as well as the honor code.
Flehinger additionally confirmed that there “would certainly not be a sanction” for freshmen who opt out of writing a response.

UPDATED: April 28, 2015, at 12:34 a.m.
Harvard professor Roland G. Fryer Jr. was awarded the 2015 John Bates Clark Medal this Friday in recognition of his contributions to research on the economics of race and inequality. Fryer is the first African-American to receive the award.
The honor, bestowed by the American Economics Association, is given to an American economist under age 40 in recognition of his or her contributions to the field. Fryer is one of several Harvard economists who have won the award, including Raj Chetty ’oo, Andrei Shleifer ’82, and former University President Lawrence H. Summers. Many recipients have gone on to win Nobel Prizes in economics.
The shock of winning the medal “hasn’t quite worn off yet,” said Fryer.
He added that he is particularly excited that students may be motivated to enter the field of economics to study issues of race, education, and inequality as a result of the recognition brought by the award.
According to Economics professor Claudia Goldin, former president of the American Economics Association, the AEA’s Committee on Honors and Awards presents a shortlist of candidates to the Executive Committee. The Executive Committee, which includes Goldin, then votes to determine the recipient of the medal.
Economics professor Lawrence F. Katz, a member of the Honors and Awards committee, praised Fryer in an email to The Crimson.
“Roland is an amazingly creative, innovative, and hard-working economist,” he wrote.
Other members of the Economics Department, who hosted a reception in the Littauer Center in honor of Fryer, also congratulated their colleague.
Summers, the 1993 recipient of the medal whom Fryer said he considers one of his mentors, praised Fryer’s work.
“His work has made me proud to be an economist,” Summers wrote in an email.
Fryer is currently working on several projects, such as studying the impact of high quality charter schools on students’ earnings later in life and research on the college choices of disadvantaged students.
Fryer said he recognizes the public policy implications of his work and remains open to future involvement in policy making, although he added that his current priorities remain his research and his young family.
“If called upon to serve, I would do it. I just hope I would be called when my two-year-old grows up a little more,” he said.
In the meantime, though, Fryer said he will continue his award-winning work.
“For me right now, it’s nose to the grind, working on papers, trying to do good economics,” he said.

Harvard Business School will reserve a set number of spots for Amherst College students applying to its online Credential of Readiness Program, as well as provide more financial aid opportunities for those applicants, starting in June.
The agreement with Amherst, announced in a press release Monday, will be replicated with other universities across the country in coming weeks.
The Credential of Readiness Program, or CORe, is part of HBX, the Business School’s online education program, and offers coursework in fundamental business education, according to its website. The program lasts 11 weeks and tuition is $1,800.
According to HBX Faculty Chair Bharat N. Anand, the agreement is intended to extend need-based financial aid opportunities to Amherst students as “financial aid works differently for [students from] different institutions.”
Last year, the CORe program determined financial aid eligibility for Harvard College students by consulting the Harvard College Financial Aid Office, resulting in financial packages “proportional to what they received at the College,” according to Anand. Only 13 percent of non-Harvard students enrolled in CORe received any form of financial aid, he added.
“The arrangement we had with Harvard Financial Aid Office is now one we can have with Amherst,” said Anand. “Finances shouldn’t be a limit in the students that you can pick.”
The CORe program has offered four different cycles of programming, the first of which started during summer 2014. About 40 to 50 percent of students during the first cycle were international students and 40 percent were women. The most recent cycle, which started less than three weeks ago, has 900 students; in total, 1,800 students have gone through the program.
Anand said that statistics for the more recent cycles are unavailable because data collection procedures are still underway.

BOSTON—The Allston Construction Mitigation Subcommittee met Monday to discuss a timeline for further construction on Harvard’s Allston Science Complex and potential plans for implementing a community-wide resident parking program.
In addition, Harvard University Construction Mitigation Director Edward G. LeFlore confirmed that all of the Charlesview apartments had been successfully demolished. The site is slated for development into a “Gateway Project,” a “mixed-use institutional building,” according to the University’s Institutional Master Plan for development in Allston.
LeFlore updated the committee on the development of Harvard’s Science Complex in Allston, stating that while official architectural plans have not been finalized, Harvard would update and “engage the community” throughout the development of the project. LeFlore said the next phase of construction, the removal of the slurry wall at the site, would take around nine months to complete.
Resident Paul “Chip” Alford expressed concerns that the lack of any publicly available plans for the complex and the upcoming removal of the slurry wall preclude lengthy and substantial project review on the part of the community and the Harvard Allston Task Force.
“I think it’s a scam, quite honestly,” said Alford, expressing frustration with what he perceived to be an intentional delay on Harvard’s part in sharing plans with the community. “They know what they’re going to build, they wouldn’t be doing anything with that slurry wall if they didn’t know what they were going to do.”
LeFlore also said that Harvard had made progress on the issue of construction worker parking, noting that a residential parking program had now been implemented on Travis and Kingsley Streets.
However, residents still expressed concerns about the parking situation. Alford, for instance, said that he wanted to start a series of petitions to transform Allston street-by-street into a residential-only parking neighborhood, noting that the subcommittee would need to collect signatures from only 51 percent of residents on each street.
Allston resident Tom Lively said that while he appreciated the benefits that resident-only parking brings, he doubted that those benefits could extend to some streets such as his, where buildings are primarily owned by absentee landlords and occupied by renters who do not register their vehicles in Massachusetts.
“If you’re going to have resident parking—it’s [desirable]—I would like to have it on my street,” Lively said, proposing the installation of parking meters on residential streets instead. “But I know I’m never going to get it.”

UPDATED: April 29, 2015, at 1:25 p.m.
It was 2 a.m. on Saturday in Cambridge, and Saroj Kandel ‘17 was preparing to go to sleep, when his panicked friend alerted him of an earthquake that had happened in Nepal. It was around noon in Nepal, and Kandel, a Nepalese native, immediately attempted to contact his family.
“I tried calling my parents, friends, and relatives in Nepal, but the network was down. After some time I called them and was fortunately able to reach them,” Kandel said. “My immediate family members are safe, but a lot of the other family members are not safe at this point.”
With reports of death tolls surpassing 4,000, and billions of dollars of damage, Kandel and fellow Nepalese student Pradeep Niroula ’18 created their own fundraising campaign. Together they messaged hundreds of students asking for support and had raised more than $1,500 as of Monday afternoon.
Kandel also emailed professors and Harvard administrators, including University President Drew G. Faust and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, asking for support in the form of a call to action to the Harvard community.
“Given the extensive alumni network and the enormous resources they have, Harvard is in a unique position to actually help rebuild Nepal,” Kandel said. “Harvard could definitely leverage these enormous resources and change millions of lives worldwide, especially in Nepal.”
Separately, the Harvard US India Initiative began its own fundraising campaign tied to the Nepal Red Cross Society, according to Udai Bothra ’16, president of the Initiative.  Though none of the Initiative’s members are Nepalese, Bothra said the organization still feels close to the cause, given the close bond between Nepal and India.
“It’s really a different country, but at the same time we don’t think of it as a different country,” Bothra said. “We’re neighbors, so it makes sense. The fact that it is so close to us and the tremors were felt in India makes it a good reason to extend a helping hand.”
In addition to raising money, other students have expressed interest in directly volunteering. Meenaski Krishna ’17, who has worked with Nepalese charities for the past five years, plans to travel to Nepal after the semester ends to help on the ground.
“I know some people who have been personally affected because I have been working with these charities,” Krishna said. “I will be helping rebuild and distribute relief supplies.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction.
CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated the name and class year of Udai Bothra ’16.

Matthew Weiner, the Emmy Award-winning creator, producer, and writer of “Mad Men,” spoke to a packed crowd about the literary process behind television writing as part of the College’s annual LITfest festival on Monday night.
The event featured a discussion between Weiner and Bret A. Johnston, co-director of LITfest and director of creative writing at Harvard, and included select clips from “Mad Men” that guided the conversation about Weiner’s writing.
Weiner spoke at length about his commitment to depicting real experiences as accurately as possible in his show.
“Television offers us a world where everybody is friends,” he said. “I was interested in capturing reality, something that was completely removed from any abstractions.”
Following a clip from the show’s fifth season, Weiner shared his personal experience with the undiagnosed depression he said he suffered from at the time of the episode’s writing.
“I was the most depressed I had ever been when writing that episode,” he said. “I had a lack of gratitude for what I had, and the characters in that episode all can’t appreciate what they have.”
He summarizes the essence of Mad Men as an exploration of the human condition of dissatisfaction, adding that, “when I was selling the show, I summarized it into two questions: ‘Is this it?’ and ‘What is wrong with me?’"
Weiner also discussed his unique scriptwriting process of dictating his ideas for each episode aloud to a transcriber, explaining that this process helps him more effectively and succinctly distill his ideas to the essential details of each scene.
“If I sat in front of a screen, I could spend a day trying to write the description of a single scene,” he said. “It’s surprising that [by dictating] you can write a whole first draft of a script in a day.”
In response to an audience member’s question, Weiner spoke to the importance of perseverance in order to break into the competitive industry of television writing.
“The truth is you will need a relative or friend to get into show business,” he said. “But there are ways to get there, like going to grad school, or taking a job so far below you, and keep writing, do contests, everything.”
Attendee Myles J. McDonough ’15 applauded Weiner’s encouraging words.
“He has a very good way of giving young writers hope, which is desperately needed,” he said.
Johnston wrote in an email to The Crimson that he invited Weiner to LITfest to inspire and offer insight to aspiring writers at the College.
“He's an artist and a craftsman in the way he approaches making stories, and he has the sensibilities of a poet,” Johnston wrote. “His influence is profound and, I have no doubts, lasting.”

UPDATED: April 28, 2015, at 1:17 a.m.
The Undergraduate Council plans to conduct a “student social life study" to quantitatively assess the social life of Harvard undergraduates.
The survey, which will be led by the Council’s Student Life Committee, will consist of one hundred students, selected randomly, with 25 students from each class. Representatives detailed the iniative at their meeting on Sunday.
According to Student Life Committee Chair Oliver W. Kim ’16, the survey will hopefully produce “objective and scientific” data about undergraduate social life. Kim is a Crimson editorial writer.
Prospective survey items include asking students what the term “social life” means to them, as well as gathering both positive and negative opinions that students hold on “sororities, fraternities, final clubs, or other similar social groups.”
UC representatives voted down an act that stood in sharp criticism to final clubs at its general meeting on March 8. Some felt that the position paper attached to the act was too strongly-worded, as it called final clubs a "mechanism for elite, male students to exploit power dynamics." The position paper came as a result of a controversial email invitation sent by the Spee Club, an all-male final club, earlier this semester.
As part of the survey, students will be interviewed in person over the course of 15 weeks, and the report compiled by the Council will contain interviewees’ anonymous responses, quoted verbatim.
One representative posed a question about the value of including members of the Class of 2019 in the survey, as they might give premature responses during their first semester as an undergraduate. Committee member Daniel R. Levine ’17 argued that “first impressions can be valuable,” and that freshmen are an important demographic to include in the survey. Levine is a Crimson news writer.
Also at Sunday’s meeting, Winthrop House Representative Vimal S. Konduri ’17, who is a Crimson news writer, sponsored an act standing in solidarity with those affected by the earthquake that struck Kathmandu, Nepal on Saturday. According to Konduri, the act was not meant to guarantee the Council’s support of any student group involved with earthquake relief.
Some representatives posed questions of whether or not issuing statements on natural disasters should be the “business of a student government.” Pforzheimer House representative William H. Greenlaw ’17 said that in lieu of a formal statement, UC representatives should simply “ask students what they want.” Konduri responded saying that he had extended solidarity to the South Asian Association, and that the Council could possibly help advertise one student’s GoFundMe campaign for relief efforts.
“This is really painful for a large group of people,” said Konduri.
Despite objections, the act passed with two abstentions.

Jessie J had already left Yardfest, but the Radcliffe lightweight crew team was still “Burnin’ Up” Saturday on the Charles. The lightweight team competed in and won the Beanpot over No. 4 BU and No. 8 MIT, while the heavyweight team—also in action on Saturday—lost against Ivy League rival No. 10 Yale.
Coming off a second-place finish at the Lightweight Invitational Regatta, the No. 3 Radcliffe lightweight team rounded out the regular season with a victory. The teams had to overcome a headwind that averaged nine miles per hour throughout competition.
Radcliffe’s varsity eight boat was coxed by junior Samantha Guhan and stroked by senior Adelaide Backer. Seniors Claire Harmange and Elizabeth MacEachern; juniors Naomi Lang, Gabby McNeill, and Olivia Henry; sophomore Elizabeth Pate; and freshman Ada Bielawski made up the rest of the boat.
The eight came in at 7:09.8, besting runner-up BU by five seconds. The Engineers placed third, posting a time of 7:37.0. The win was the third consecutive Beanpot victory for the Black and White.
“Overall, this day marked our team's best racing,” Harvard coach Lou Berl said. “We had a stiff, direct headwind which makes for a longer, tougher race but enables all crews to set their boats more easily compared to a tail wind.”
With this win the team also took home the Muri Cup, which it had won in each of the past seven years.
The JV boat finished second for Radcliffe with a time of 7:41.8. BU set the pace in that race, finishing ahead of the Black and White by seven seconds with a time of 7:34.3. MIT finished behind by open water, stopping the clock at 8:04.4.
In the varsity four race, the Black and White, coxed by Madeline Zabriskie and stroked by sophomore Erin Walk, again took home the honors, as its time of 8:48.7 was 20 seconds better than that of the Terriers.
The novice eight contingent was able to ride a strong showing into a victory. They notched a time of 8:23.5, besting the Engineers by over 40 seconds. BU did not field a novice eight at the competition.
“The field of lightweight teams may be small, but it is extremely competitive,” Berl said. “If all goes accordingly, we plan to find more speed in the week leading up to Sprints and are very excited to have an opportunity to race everyone again.”
On the heavyweight side, the No. 14 Black and White finally returned home for the first time this season to host the Nathaniel Case Cup against the Bulldogs. The strong, swirling gusts continued for the heavyweight races and contributed to occasional whitecaps over the course of competition.
The team was coming off a third-place finish at the Clemson Invitational last week, while Yale was coming off a loss to Princeton at the Eisenberg Cup.
The varsity eight, led by senior coxswain Jenny Wong and junior stroke Freddie Archibald, finished with a time of 7:06.6. The boat was seven seconds behind the pace of the Bulldogs, which crossed the finish line with a time of 6:59.0.
Radcliffe also dropped the second varsity event, which was the closest race of the day. Its time of 7:05.7 was three seconds behind Yale’s finish time of 7:02.0.
The Bulldogs were also able to come out on top in the varsity four, varsity four B, and the third varsity races.
The varsity four boat lost by open water, behind Yale by nearly 21 seconds. The B and C boats also lost, by 14 seconds and over a minute, respectively. The third varsity boat was behind the Yale boat by 17 seconds.
“Going into the next few weeks, we need to find out what works,” Radcliffe junior Gen Mulligan said. “We have all the right pieces, we just need to figure out how to fit them together.”

In the Ivy League Championships this weekend, the Harvard men’s golf team took on the six other conference contenders on the Saucon Valley Country Club in Bethlehem, Penn. While the Crimson was seeded second and slated to be a favorite in winning, the squad was unable to deliver this result and ended in third.
“Once we get to an event like this, we really just need to be focused on the things that we do when we train day-in and day-out,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads said. “Despite seeing what the division is between where other teams are and where we are, we just have to see if we are doing our job close to 100% of the time. That’s easy to say but very challenging to do.”
Individually, three of the five Crimson players playing in the tournament were able to notch ranks in the top 20. Junior Rohan Ramnath was able to come in 16th by shooting a total score of 229, or 13 over-par.
“In terms of work ethic, we definitely prepared to the best of our ability,” sophomore Robert Deng said. “Even though there is definitely room for improvement next year, everyone [this weekend] stayed strong and performed as well as they could and I’m very proud of everybody for doing so.”
Deng lead the team for the weekend, shooting the third lowest score on round three of 69 (-3). Deng’s second and third round performances were both under-par and propelled him into a third place finish behind University of Pennsylvania’s Austin Powell and Princeton’s Quinn Prchal. Prchal claimed the individual champion title with a score of six-under par.
In his debut Ivy League Championship, freshman Greg Royston managed to place in the top ten. Although his first round found him with a five-over par score, he shot an even-par in the second round to match three other people tied for seventh place. Over the course of the season Royston has ranked second in scoring average on the team.
The top two individual players helped claim UPenn and Princeton’s first and second place, respectively. The Quakers achieved a total score of 885 to beat out the Tigers by one shot. Harvard followed in third, only five shots short of matching UPenn’s total. Columbia was only two shots away from the Crimson with a score of 902, but the other three Ivy rivals fell behind the Lions by more than ten strokes.
Rounding out Harvard’s roster were sophomores Kendrick Vinar and Daniel De La Garza. Vinar ended the tournament tied for 26th while shooting 17 over, and De La Garza finished tied for 31st with a score of 235 for the Crimson.
After ending the first day in sixth place, Harvard succeeded in scoring low enough to out-play Yale and Dartmouth in the second and third rounds in order to end as third.
“We had a tough round scoring the first day, and had a lot of work to do in adjusting to the greens,” Rhoads said. “We kept getting better each day, and in the last two there were a bunch of best scores. I’m very proud of how we did not panic after the first day and just tried to stay the course. I wish we had a couple more days to show how strong our level is, but we ran out of holes to play by the end.”
UPenn and Princeton’s locations as the southern-most Ivy League schools allowed their golf courses to be opened the earliest.  In contrast, the Crimson men’s golf team was only able to practice in its indoor training facility until the outdoor courses were opened in the past week after record snowfall in Boston this season.
“We didn’t do as well as we would have liked,” Deng said. “But, having said that, we do need to recognize the factors that were going against us. So, given that we tried our best and prepared ourselves to the best of our ability, there is really not much that we can be disappointed about.
It was a good tournament in that everything we could control, we did a good job with. I think the outcome was a little disappointing because we are at the top of the league for playing level.”

For former Crimson forward Mike Taylor ’08, the decision to pursue professional hockey after graduation came abruptly. After NHL teams passed on him through his final year of draft eligibility, Taylor did not plan on continuing his career after Harvard until late in his senior year.
But after encouragement from Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91, Taylor signed during his senior spring with the Hartford Wolf Pack of the American Hockey League, where he would play for two years with affiliates of the New York Rangers and Carolina Hurricanes.
“For some it’s pure love of the game, for others it’s the fear of not having hockey in their life,” Taylor says. “You either have to have the complete mindset that this is what I want to do, and completely commit yourself to it, or just love it and [not] want to do anything else.”
The world of professional sports is one not uncommon to those who have played under the lights at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center.
Twenty-seven Harvard men’s hockey alumni have played in the NHL. However, many more Crimson graduates, like Taylor, have continued their careers elsewhere with minor league affiliates and other professional teams.
For Taylor, the decision to pursue a professional career didn’t come easy.
“Playing professionally wasn’t necessarily something I had set my hopes and dreams on,” Taylor says. “I had realistic expectations, and if the opportunity came, I was probably going to see where it would lead me, but that didn’t really come until my senior year when the season ended.”
The transition to college hockey was a smooth one for Taylor, who won a conference tournament and appeared in two NCAA tournaments during his freshman and sophomore years in Cambridge. The path to professional hockey was a more difficult one—particularly for an undrafted prospect.
“People tell you that it doesn’t matter if you’re drafted, [that] you still have the opportunity,” Taylor says. “But after going through it, there’s definitely more of an emphasis placed on the players who are drafted.”
For undrafted players, just earning a tryout with an NHL affiliate can be a demanding process. For Taylor, there were no inscribed invitations.
“I went undrafted, [and] then I was just going to basically see how the rest of my career played out,” Taylor says. “I was open to the opportunity [of minor league hockey], but it wasn’t at the top of my list.”
After a few teams showed interest in Taylor during a standout senior season, the opportunity seemed to be a bit more reachable. Following an overtime loss to Boston College in the Beanpot final, Taylor took the first step to play in the minors. He called a scout from the New York Rangers on the recommendation of Donato, who had played with the Rangers for a season.
“[Donato] thought that would be a good fit for me from an organizational standpoint,” Taylor says. “It ended up working out when I got an amateur tryout with the Hartford Wolf Pack.”
Taylor cites his tryout with the Wolf Pack as one of the tougher steps in making it into the minor leagues. The process did not end at the tryout, however, as he continued to compete for major roster spots with players in whom NHL teams had already invested scouting resources.
Drafted players have the added benefit of attending NHL summer development camps, where prospects can become more familiar with the organizations that selected them.
“Unless you really dazzle them with a performance, you’re not going to get the same look as one of their guys that was drafted and has been in the system,” Taylor says.
While being drafted is an important factor in the decision to play after college, for many players post-grad hockey is simply the pursuit of a dream. Despite being drafted in the third round, former Crimson defenseman Kenny Smith ’04 understood that his chances of making the NHL were slim when he signed with the Edmonton Oilers’ ECHL affiliate in 2004.
“Pretty much [for] everyone that gets drafted and even the guys who pursue a career after going undrafted, the goal is to try and make the NHL,” Smith says. “But I think we all appreciate early on that it’s a pretty difficult goal to obtain and only a small portion of the people who get drafted even get there.”
NHL teams have drafted 10 players on Harvard’s current roster. At the end of March, star junior forward Jimmy Vesey turned down an opportunity to sign with the Nashville Predators in order to return for his senior year. Smith took comfort in the fact that he could approach a professional career with a Harvard diploma in his back pocket.
“For myself, I knew I wanted to try and make a career out of hockey even before I committed to Harvard, so committing to Harvard was a way to sort of create that safety net and know that there’s going to be really good opportunities after my playing career,” Smith says.
While neither Taylor nor Smith got the call up to the NHL before retiring, they both enjoyed their post-grad hockey experiences. For Taylor and Smith, minor league hockey was more than a shot at the NHL—it was a means of continuing to play the game they love.
“You get to have the professional experience and [play at] really nice rinks and play in front of big crowds and do all the things that we love doing as hockey players,” Smith says. “Part of it is just continuing a lifestyle you’ve always had as a hockey player and not really wanting to let that go.”
Taylor echoes the thought.
“When else in life would you have that opportunity?” Taylor says. “I hadn’t necessarily planned on it, but I had played myself into an opportunity that was a once in a lifetime chance, and I’m definitely glad that I did it for a couple years.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As classes wind down and students prepare for final exams, the women’s golf team found success at a final of its own. After leading their team to an Ivy League Championship, junior Courtney Hooten and sophomore Anne Cheng earned this weeks Athlete of the Week honors. However, there were a few other Crimson athletes who had strong performances this week.
Brenna Nelsen, Women’s Golf
This weekend at the Women’s Ivy Championships, senior Brenna Nelsen shot a 231 over three rounds at Saucon Valley Country Club in Bethlehem, Pa. That score was good enough to tie with two other players for eighth place overall at the tournament. Her performance helped lead her team to its fourth consecutive Ancient Eight title.
Nelsen was one of only seven competitors to shoot a 75 or lower in the second round of play. She followed this up with another 75 in round three. Her round one score was an 81. She was joined by teammates Anne Cheng and Courtney Hooton in the list of top 10 finishers. Nelsen was only four strokes off the pace of co-leaders Christine Kim of Brown and Marika Lu of Yale on a tight leaderboard.
Julia Glynn, Women’s Lacrosse
Freshman midfielder Julia Glynn helped the Crimson secure two wins last week, a 12-1 victory against UMass Lowell on Wednesday and a 15-4 defeat of Yale on Saturday.
In the first contest, Glynn scored two unassisted goals in the second half and added an assist on sophomore cohort Megan Hennessey’s tally. She followed this up with another two-goal performance against Yale, this time adding five assists to her ledger. The seven point game represented a career high for the freshman.
For her efforts, the Manhasset, N.Y. native was named Ivy League Co-Offensive Player of the Week. This is the second time on the season she has received the honor.
Morgan Cheek, Men’s Lacrosse
In Harvard’s hard-fought 8-7 win over Yale on Saturday, freshman midfielder Morgan Cheek put two shots past the Bulldogs goalkeeper. The first came in the second quarter, less than a minute after teammate J.T. Palladino’s tally. It extended the Crimson lead to 5-1.
Cheek’s second goal came less than a minute into the fourth period. It was scored at a time when Yale had come up with three of the last four goals, allowing the Bulldogs to cut the Harvard lead to 6-4. The win moves the Crimson back to .500 on the year with a 7-7 overall record.

Ahhh, the last week of classes is finally here and so is one of the bigger events of freshman year. Needless to say, this freshman formal is indeed a special occasion and will be held in the most glamorous of venues– the Science Center Plaza. Anyways, Flyby’s experienced committee gives you the best tips on how to make this one of the best (and safe) nights of your freshman career.
DO NOT PREGAME LIKE IT’S YOUR LAST TIMESeriously, guys...there’s a reason as to why y’all are in the SC Plaza in the first place. For those that don’t know how to handle their beverages, err on the side of caution and replace vodka with water (lol). The goal is to have a good time, not to end up at UHS or have the Class of 2019 hold their freshman formal in the library.
Bring a date if you canGoing with a person that you’ve become good friends always leads to a fun time, or maybe you want to take a chance and ask out that special someone? Enjoy the night under the stars (or the tent where the formal will be) and be sure to take pictures for the *memories*.
Crash itHow much are formal tickets nowadays? Regardless, it’s not as if Harvard is in dire need of it or has a massive endowment or anything. Draw a simple X on your hand or simply sneak in through the back of the tent. Should be easy and hey, you don’t have to stay the entire night to get your money’s worth.
Dress like 007Okay, maybe don’t overdo it. But the last wave of midterms just ended and reading period is here so relax and look sharp for the night. Get that new Facebook profile picture with your friends or Insta while you’re at it.
Have fun, freshmen! It'll be a night to remember (or not).

Congratulations, you did it!  You spent countless nights in Lamont studying, completed all of your p-sets, finished up your midterms, and managed to remain in good standing in your eight extracurricular clubs.  And with reading period starting this Thursday, there are only a few weeks left of studying for exams and writing papers before the end of the spring semester. For those of us still on the midterm grind (I see you PS1 and Orgo) with no end in sight, don’t worry; Flyby has your guide on how to stay motivated through the home stretch.
1.  Primal Scream
That’s right, get excited because it’s that time of year again. There’s nothing quite like participating in the semi-annual festivities that include a band, a possible repeat appearance from Dean Khurana, tourists, and all of your intoxicated classmates. So get your head off that desk and keep pushing ahead on that Expos draft.
2.  Coffee
Use your assignments as an excuse to buy massive amounts of Venti Chai Tea Lattes or just plain large coffees from Lamont Cafe because work is always more enjoyable after an excessive amount of caffeine.
3. Board Plus
With the end of the school year fast approaching and many long nights ahead, now is the perfect time to splurge on all of your Greenhouse Cafe favorites and empty out that Board Plus account. Don’t feel ashamed when you’re holding up the line at Greenhouse by loading twenty Odwalla bars in your bag. Be proud! Consider it a victory because of your frugal spending throughout the year.
4. Kendrick Lamar
If you’re feeling blue from work and are looking for an incredibly stimulating mental experience, check out Kendrick’s new album “To Pimp a Butterfly.” With that kind of title and Kendrick’s impressive list of songs including King Kunta, your expectations for this album should be sky high. And Mr. Lamar does not disappoint—one rap critic even wrote that “it promotes self-betterment.”
5.  Warm Weather
Unless you are researching the melting ice shelf in Antarctica, chances are pretty good that you won’t see—dare I say it—snow or temperatures remotely close to 32 degrees Fahrenheit this summer. So as you add the finishing touches to that final problem set, keep those warm thoughts in mind.
6.  No More Tourists!
This is a big one. If you’re tired of being photographed whenever you step inside the Yard, or if you’re just annoyed about being someone else’s personal photographer, fear no more. At least until summer tour season starts.
7.  No more smelly roommates.
Admit it. You don’t really know why you ended up rooming with them. Your two close friends grabbed a double and you ended up stuck with the weird kid in the group. He never showered and went to great lengths to avoid doing laundry, including using your bed as his personal clothing rack. The good news is your ordeal is almost over and next year you get a single!
Keep these thing in mind as motivation during the last few weeks of the spring term!

Harvard’s Student-Athlete Advisory Committee will present its annual HESPY awards honoring Crimson athletes next Monday, May 4. The event, inspired by ESPN’s ESPY Awards, will be hosted by Harvard football’s Dan Moody ’16 and will include a reception with food, drinks, and photographs on a red carpet, as well as the award presentations.
“The HESPYs is a semiformal awards show that unites all members of the Harvard community in celebration of the athletic achievements of athletes and teams from the previous year,” said HESPYs organizer and Harvard softball player Katie Lantz ’15. “We think show host Dan Moody will supply some humor while our stellar list of award presenters including Harvard professors, faculty members, and coaches will make for a great show.”
The awards presented will range from Rookie of the Year to Best Game Face, although Lantz said that her personal favorite is the Biggest Cold Tub Wimp award, honoring those members of the Harvard athletic community who are less than enthused about immersing themselves in the training room’s ice bath after practice. Winners were chosen by open voting on the HESPYs Facebook page.
The event, which SAAC organizers have been planning since the fall, will also feature clips of highlights from the 2014-2015 season.
“This year has seen some incredible athletic performances, and we are excited to relive them,” Lantz said.
Tickets for the show, which will be in Science Center Hall C from 6:30 to 9:00 p.m. on Monday, are $5 and available at GoCrimson.com/HESPYs.
