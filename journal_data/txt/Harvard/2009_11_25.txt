After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The University of California has reached a financial impasse that cannot be overcome without painful measures. Its Board of Regents recognizes this inconvenient truth and has resorted to increasing tuition costs by an additional $2,500 for the next academic year, a proportional increase of about a third for in-state students. This is an unsavory solution to an unavoidable problem—the Golden State faces empty coffers and a projected deficit in the tens of billions and must make cuts across the board to stay afloat. However, while some tuition increases might be necessary, the in-state students of the University of California system should be the last to suffer. They are members of tax-paying households in California and should have prioritized access to its public- education offerings.
There is no easy solution to the massive problem the UC system and the State of California faces, but some options are more desirable than others. If the Board of Regents must hike tuition, the main part of this financial burden should be placed on out-of-state students, whose parents are not taxpaying California citizens and who still have the benefit of access to cheap public education in their own states. It may seem unfair for out-of-state students to be penalized for the mistakes of California, but the UC system should primarily serve residents of California, many of whom do not have access to out-of-state educational opportunities and whose tax dollars fund the University of California campuses.
Tuition hikes focused on out-of-state students may deter some potential applicants and prospective students, but placing the financial burden on in-state students is especially harmful to low-income Californians, for whom the UC system is essential for receiving a college education. This would have the unfortunate result of increasing socioeconomic and ethic homogeneity in a university system that already suffers from a lack of racial diversity. Granted, geographical diversity would suffer from tuition hikes aimed at out-of-state students, but there is no good solution to the University of California’s dilemma—only less bad ones.
From a broader perspective, this entire lamentable situation was not unforeseeable. California’s dysfunctional political system, which leads to constantly rising spending that is rarely accompanied by tax increases, is the primary culprit. Issues like the tuition hikes in the UC system are the symptoms of poor fiscal practices that must be corrected if the welfare of California residents is to be preserved. The inability to implement taxation that keeps pace with spending is crippling California. If Californians are sincere about avoiding problems like the tuition debacle in the UC system, they must address the root cause of their budgetary woes. In the meantime, students will have to pick up the tab for the Golden’s State’s financial irresponsibility.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For me, fixing a cup of coffee is a private matter. From years of practice, I’ve learned to furtively palm sweetener packets and hold them tightly together, tearing them as one, so it’s impossible for a casual observer to tell how many I actually use. Why? Well, I use a lot. And I mean a lot.
My father recently offered to pick me up a coffee from Dunkin’ Donuts, but he almost refused when I told him what I wanted. To him, ordering my coffee—with skim milk and five Splendas—was as embarrassing as if I’d asked him to buy a jumbo box of tampons.
My friends regularly tease me about how sweet I like coffee, yet I find myself judging those with tastes even more indulgent than mine—O ye lowly disciples of the white chocolate mocha and bottled Starbucks Frappuccino! But why? We’d never criticize someone for a preference for seafood, Russian dressing, or whole wheat bread. There’s no reason why one’s choice of drink should be conflated with a character flaw.
At this point, there are now a million permutations of “coffee.” The barista culture has risen around (and fueled) our natural predisposition for finickiness. From an elegant cappuccino to some New Jersey diner mug-tar, there’s a coffee out there for everyone. You may add or subtract espresso shots, foam, ice, soymilk, and sugar-free hazelnut syrup as you see fit; you are free to project our personalities onto our drink to whatever extent you choose.
People who drink black coffee do so with a certain macho pride, as if it were a feat of strength. In pop culture, black coffee has become a meme. It’s the John Wayne of caffeinated beverages—a metonym of stoicism, intensity, and general badassery. Every hack screenwriter knows that the fastest way to toughen up a character is to have him or her order a cup of black coffee. In the same way, its converse is a ready-brew instant joke. On “The Office,” Michael Scott drinks milk and sugar (hold the coffee); on “Parks and Recreation,” Leslie Knope likes hers smothered in whipped cream. The difference between black and instant coffee has become as vast as the difference between scotch rocks and appletinis.
While there’s an argument to be made for appreciating coffee’s natural flavor, as a utilitarian drinker, I don’t find it too compelling. I know, I know, there’s Jamaican Blue Mountain, there’s Tanzanian peaberry—there are plenty of obscure beans to delight the connoisseur. After all, coffee is an acquired taste. But so is anything, I would imagine, if you work hard enough at acquiring it.
When it comes to coffee, I say: to each his own. It should be an unalienable human right to enjoy what you eat and drink. Anyway, under the anonymity of the lid, who can tell the difference?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Caster Semenya forced to take gender test, is a woman…and a man,” a September headline of the New York Daily News declared. Four months after the initial eruption of controversy surrounding Semenya’s gender following her spectacular eight-second improvement at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics, the jury is still out: Is the South African runner a woman… or a man?
Posing the question makes one uneasy, and for good reason. More than Semenya’s frustrating evasion of traditional gender categories, this query threatens to transform Semenya from a human being into a circus sideshow—the freakish object of our scrutinizing gaze. In the majority of modern linguistic systems, to be genderless is literally to become a thing—to morph from a comfortably defined “he” or “she” into an anomalous “it.”
The very idea that a person could wake up one morning, only to find that she is not what she thinks she is, is horrifying—the Gregor Samsa epiphany that everyone hopes to avoid. Tropes of metamorphosis pervade our collective mythologies, from Ovid’s tales to Hollywood blockbusters. Robert Pattinson’s attractiveness notwithstanding, the modern-day vampire fetish speaks to our cultural fascination with figures who move seamlessly across boundaries: schoolboy by day, blood-sucker-cum-ascetic by night. We may laugh at the episode of “The Office” in which Andy questions his heterosexuality due to water-cooler gossip, but the same scenario is playing out for Semenya in real time.
The International Association of Athletics Federations has declared that Semenya can keep her gold medal from the World Championships but has refused to opine on her eligibility for competition as a woman. Armed with what it claimed were leaked medical records, Australia’s Daily Telegraph reported in September that the runner had external female genitalia but lacked ovaries and uterus and had undescended testes that endowed her with testosterone levels three times as high as her female competitors.
If the IAAF has been wishy-washy on Semenya’s case, it is because it does not have an answer. The federation lacks a codified method for sex determination, which, per its policy, is nebulously ascertained through the amalgamated opinion of a panel of medical “experts.” Confronted with a question that verges on the rhetorical, the IAAF appears to have adopted a “what you see is what you get” strategy—one that has utterly failed to rationalize the subtle gradations of biological sex.
South Africa’s complex legacy of apartheid confounds the impasse. Exclusionary schemes of categorization have plagued the nation’s history, beginning with the Population Registration Act, which enjoined census-takers, by and large white, to segment society into three classes—white, black, or colored—that in turn dictated an individual’s access to political, social, and economic entitlements. Highly arbitrary and highly racialized ascriptions of identity haunt the African continent at large. In Rwanda, ethnic identity cards, issued by Belgian colonial authorities, helped to rigidify the social hierarchies that culminated in the 1994 genocide. Impose a gendered hierarchy on top of these devastating imperial bequests, and it’s easy to see why Semenya’s personal story has become eminently political, provoking the South African sports minister to declare a “third world war” should the runner be banned from competition.
Feminist theory has long touted the distinction between sex—a biological given determined by inchoate mixture of genetics, genitalia, and hormones—and gender, a cultural construct into which human beings are socialized. Socioeconomic developments, along with the LGBT movement, have attenuated the original binaries, which clearly mapped man and woman onto masculine and feminine, and superimposed heterosexuality over both. Yet, while stereotypical notions of masculinity and femininity are no longer firmly en vogue (at least in liberal political circles), the sex binary has rarely been interrogated. American society, in fact, is organized around this dichotomy, from the seemingly prosaic decision of which restroom to use to weightier issues of legal rights and marriage.
The division between man—penis, testosterone, XY—and woman—vagina, estrogen, XX—occupies the status of the taken for granted in our cultural imagination. Yet, when asked the question, “What is the essential difference between a man and a woman?”. neither the IAAF nor society at large can provide a straight answer—especially when confronted with a figure like Semenya who appears to toe both sides of the line. Science, it seems, is not the be-all-end-all of this battle: External genitalia can be ambiguous; hormone levels vary from person to person; and men can have two X-chromosomes, while women can have only one. Semenya remains an uncomfortable ellipsis, interrupting our sexual binary.
The biological and the social are intertwined in such messy ways that the gender-sex distinction seems to perpetually collapse on itself. Feminist thinkers who famously eschewed sexual essentialism, such as Simone de Beauvoir, upheld at least a specter of determinism in practice. Medical authorities, too, have not determined how to handle people who fall outside of science’s neat dualism. The sheer array of terms for these unclassifiable cases—hermaphrodite, intersex, disorder of sex development—is baffling. Disparaged, whether rightly or wrongly so, with charges of political correctness, this terminological deluge speaks to a deeper problem: Language itself fails to accommodate the ambiguities of sex, gender, and everything in between, incessantly insisting on fitting square pegs into round holes.
In destabilizing the sex-based division of sports, Semenya has destabilized the way in which we understand sex, gender, and ultimately ourselves. At core, Semenya’s quandary underscores the problems inherent in ascribing identity. In matters of bodily classification, who should have the final say? The individual, medical experts, an international athletic bureaucracy, the government, popular opinion, or a farrago of all five? The answer, at least in Semenya’s case, has been a long time coming.

To the editors:
In a front-page article in Tuesday’s Crimson, “UC Race Opens With Media Rush,” Crimson writers reported that “the ‘Long-Johnson’ ticket… seems to be taking the race less seriously” than the other candidates. Our campaign would like to set the record straight and send a message to our opponents and the student body: this campaign is serious. While it may be true that Long-Johnson (note to Crimson editors: no quotation marks needed) has had a slow start in the campaign, let it be known that we are preparing to hit the ground running. Hard.
The quotes around “Long-Johnson” that were used in the article were a striking indication of The Crimson’s lack of respect for our ticket. Why quotes around our campaign name and not the others?
Furthermore, the article took a turn for the worse when it implied that our lack of experience on the UC was one of the reasons that we are “taking the race less seriously.” It is precisely because we are outsiders that we believe seriously that we should be elected. Looking through our platform on our website or glancing at our posters, you might notice that our rhetoric is a bit satirical of the jargon and goals of UC candidates. We take this approach because we seriously want to bring change to what students increasingly see as a self-important yet flaccid instrument.
We hope that The Crimson can come to terms with our perhaps unorthodox way of running a campaign with a little humor thrown in. As we campaign to bring change to the UC, we would appreciate more respectful coverage of our ticket and some semblance of objectivity from The Crimson.
We would also like to add that we hope the student body enjoys the campaign as much as we will.

To the editors:
During Harvard’s Veterans Day celebration on Wed., Nov. 11, President Drew Gilpin Faust embarrassed herself and the university.  At this ceremony a new plaque in the memorial chapel was unveiled that honors Harvard’s 12 Medal of Honor recipients.  There were representatives from the families of all 12 recipients, including Susan Roosevelt Weld, the great-granddaughter and granddaughter of Medal of Honor recipients President Theodore Roosevelt (Class of 1880) and his son, Gen. Theodore Roosevelt II (Class of 1909).
President Faust was invited to speak in front of this large crowd of distinguished guests. However, rather than first thanking the Veterans and their families, she instead began her speech by lamenting the fact that none of Harvard’s Medal of Honor recipients were women.  Finally, she emphatically stated that “I look forward to the day when Harvard’s daughters are honored on this plaque as well.”
Does she know that 60 percent of all Medals of Honor awarded since WWII have been given posthumously?  Does she therefore look forward to seeing Harvard’s daughters killed on the battlefield?  Why did President Faust not also bemoan the fact that there are no black or Native American Medal of Honor recipients from Harvard?  In fact, President Faust could take an active role to encourage more women to join the military and earn this award if she would allow ROTC back on Harvard’s campus.
There is an appropriate time to try and advance your political and social platforms.  This was not it.  Ironically, she chose to push her agenda at a service dedicated to the very people who defend her right to free speech.   In a chapel full of distinguished visitors, President Faust embarrassed herself, Harvard University, and the agenda she was trying to promote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences has lost another top financial administrator in the midst of its struggle with a $110 million budget deficit.
Former Associate Dean for Finance Deena Giancotti departed for a consulting job last week after five years at Harvard, during which time FAS witnessed both a period of unprecedented growth and the current fiscal crisis.
“We are very grateful to Deena for her years of service in leading the FAS finance organization, particularly this last year through what proved to be one of the most challenging in our history,” wrote FAS Dean Michael D. Smith in an e-mail to administrators earlier this month.
Giancotti left Harvard less than a month after Leslie A. Kirwan ’79—appointed by Smith in September—took on the post of FAS dean for administration and finance, a position whose responsibilities overlap with those of Giancotti’s old job.
Giancotti joins a growing group of departing Harvard financial administrators.
This July, Brett C. Sweet, former dean of administration and finance, was named chief financial officer at Vanderbilt after less than a year at Harvard. And a month earlier, University Executive Vice President Edward C. Forst ’82 returned to Wall Street after only a year in his Harvard job.
After his departure, Sweet’s responsibilities were temporarily split, with Giancotti taking on the additional FAS financial responsibilities.
Smith appointed Kirwan to replace Sweet in September. She assumed her position on Nov. 2, around the time Giancotti approached Smith about her departure. Before coming to Harvard, Giancotti had been a manager at the professional service firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. During her tenure at Harvard, she oversaw the restructuring and growth of FAS’s finance offices and spearheaded the publication of a new annual FAS financial report.
Former FAS Budget Director Eric Kopstain has agreed to take over Giancotti’s duties until a permanent replacement is found. He declined to comment for this article. Giancotti was also unavailable for comment.
No official announcement was made about Giancotti’s departure, and members of her office said they did not know where, specifically, she had gone. As of last night, she was still listed in the Harvard directory under her former position.
“Through a number of leadership changes, Deena has quietly and consistently worked to improve the financial systems and processes of the FAS,” Smith wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An avid rock climber, rower, and chess player, former Cabot House resident and aspiring arborist M. Brooke Halsey ’06 will be remembered by friends and family as a humble “wiry tree spirit” with a profound sense of humor.
Halsey died last Tuesday at the age of 26. His family declined to disclose the cause of death.
Halsey started college at Princeton in fall of 2000 and studied for a semester at the Center for Northern Studies in Vermont. He transferred to Harvard in the fall of 2004, finishing college in December of 2006 as a biology concentrator.
After graduation, Halsey joined an engineering research lab at Dartmouth College. But six months later, he traded in his lab coat to pursue his love of the outdoors, later founding a tree service company in Vermont called Halsey Treenail.
Halsey also volunteered as a firefighter during his time in Vermont because he was interested in public service and wanted to do something to help his town, said Halsey’s brother-in-law, Kit Leckerling.
Halsey, who came from a family of linguists, was fluent in Mandarin among other languages and interested in Asian culture. He once wrote a physics paper combining his interests in linguistics and science, explaining Einsteinian theory in Chinese.
Cabot House Master Jay M. Harris said that Halsey will always be remembered as a role model, both spiritually and intellectually.
“You just felt stupid being angry or whiny around him because he was above it,” Harris said. “He had that certain kind of calm that made you feel dumb.”
Halsey was known for his light-heartedness. Once a friend offered him a donut, and Halsey declined, saying jokingly, “I can’t distinguish the taste of something from its effects on my body.”
At Halsey’s memorial service on Sunday, many who knew him mentioned his passion for knowledge and his capacity to learn new skills quickly.
Michael K. Mulligan, headmaster of Thacher School in California where Halsey attended high school, added that Halsey was “Zen-like in his abnegation of the ego.”
“He was always doing something for somebody,” Leckerling said. “If there is a tree down across the road, he’d be the guy to go out there and clear it out, not hoping everybody would think he was such a great person, but because he had a commitment to helping people.”
In a letter to Halsey’s family, Stuart C. Wulsin ’06 recalled a time when Halsey rescued an inebriated student from the Cabot House roof by devising a contraption made from rope and a harness.
Wulsin said he personally experienced Halsey’s willingness to help others when he was running a marathon. Wulsin, 10 miles into the race and exhausted, saw Halsey cheering for him along the sidelines. Halsey stepped over the sidelines and ran alongside Wulsin for the next 10 miles still wearing his khakis. Wulsin said that Halsey’s unusual act drew the attention of the crowd, which began cheering “Go Pants Man!”
Halsey is survived by his mother, father, and five sisters.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Charles M. Stang ’97, now an assistant professor of early Christian thought at Harvard Divinity School, was at the College, he was “not at all” religious.
But through the course of his undergraduate career as a philosophy concentrator living in Kirkland House, he says he became increasingly spiritual, so much so that he says he “felt called to the life of studying and teaching about religion” by the time he graduated.
And 11 years after finishing college, he joined the HDS faculty and is now teaching up-and-coming ministers and academics about Christian tradition during the third to fifth centuries.
Harvard today plays host to students at both ends of Stang’s own spectrum of religious experience, having departed substantially from its original role as a training ground for Christian clergy to become a place for students to explore religion, or not.
‘GODLESS HARVARD’?
In 1636, Harvard was founded by the Massachusetts Bay Colony “to advance learning and perpetuate it to posterity; dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to the churches, when our present ministers shall lie in the dust.”
Although the University was never formally affiliated with any religious denomination, its original motto was “Veritas Christo et Ecclesiae,” or “Truth for Christ and the Church.” And its 1646 statutes decreed that “every one shall consider the main End of his life and studies, to know God and Jesus Christ which is Eternal Life.”
In this vein, many of Harvard’s early graduates went on to become clergymen in Puritan churches.
“Massachusetts was founded by religious people,” says Jonathan C. Page ’02, the Epps fellow and assistant chaplain at Memorial Church. “Back then, theology was queen of scientists. Therefore anyone who went to Harvard was a leading citizen of the colony—a good theologian.”
But over the course of the next century, Enlightenment ideals, which posed strong critiques against religion, found substantial intellectual support at Harvard, so much so that Puritan minister Cotton Mather, class of 1678, described the school as “godless Harvard.”
In 1886, Harvard became the first college in the United States to remove compulsory morning prayers and chapel under President Charles W. Eliot. And throughout the 19th century, Harvard consistently produced the fewest ministers compared to peer institutions, Page says.
As separate seminary programs began to arise, the role of religion in the undergraduate curriculum became nebulous, and the University began to offer courses in Christianity for college graduates, eventually sparking the creation of the Divinity School in 1816 to encourage a “serious, impartial, and unbiased investigation of Christian truth,” according to its constitution.
MULTI-THEISTIC
Just as the University expanded from its mission of training ministers over the years, so too has the Divinity School broadened its scope.
By the late 20th century, a liberal Christian interpretation had taken hold at the Divinity School, dominating its pedagogy and culture, Stang says.
But now, he says the school has seen an influx of students of the evangelical tradition, diversifying this liberal Christian bent.
“Other Christians have filled in,” he says. “HDS is no longer what it once was. It’s more diverse in its Christianity.”
Moreover, until recently, HDS has placed other faiths “on the fringe,” says Gordon D. Kaufman, a professor emeritus who taught theology from 1963 to 1995.
But while Christianity remains the subject of choice for an overwhelming proportion of the faculty, it is no longer the sole focus of the School, says Professor Janet Gyatso, who teaches Buddhism at HDS.
“I think the mission has been changed, and that it still has a focus,” she says. “The Divinity School is about religion. It’s not necessarily about Christianity.”
She says that non-Western faiths have found a larger place at the school, encouraging a more general study of religion.
“We started to have a critical mass in non-Western religion, as a result of which in the last 10 years, we have changed our curricular structure,” Gyatso says.
“We’re now integrating non-Western religion, and it’s not just because of a greater number of non-Western courses. The whole understanding of religion and how we study it has shifted.”
And in addition to training some students to be Christian ministers—a program that was one of Harvard’s original goals—Gyatso says that the Divinity School is developing a Buddhist ministry curriculum to complement its Christian counterpart.
‘NO CONSENSUS ON HOW TO ORGANIZE RELIGION’
While there does not seem to be an organized place at the College for religion, Memorial Church Minister Peter J. Gomes says it is by no means obsolete.
“Students are more curious now. A girl who sings in Radcliffe chorus who doesn’t know what [a religious song she is singing] means will inquire about it,” Gomes says. “She might take a course, talk to people and pursue it in one way or another.”
But Gomes recognizes that Harvard has evolved religiously from where it started.
“Harvard is a much more diverse place now,” Gomes says. “There is no consensus on how to organize religion.”
And students say that while religion may play a role in students’ lives, it doesn’t tend to govern the day-to-day.
Danni Xie ’12, an economics concentrator and a self-described agnostic, says she doesn’t “think religion plays a large role in your interactions with other people.”
“I have friends who are in religious groups, and in the groups they find people who are similar to them and get the support they need,” she says.
“Though they don’t talk about it, people are religious here, though they keep it personal. They keep it on the low,” says Alexander E. Johnson ’10, a licensed minister and member of SoulFood ministries on campus.
“You have a large variety of people from different religious backgrounds and it’s not very evident when you first get here, but it is something that beneath the surface is certainly the case.”
As to whether religion will disappear from Harvard, Gomes’ answer is simple. “We are still here. We will always be here,” he says.

The Michael C. Rockefeller Memorial Fellowship named six seniors as 2010-11 travel fellows on Saturday.
Thomas J. Brennan ’10 of Lowell, Judith E. Fan ’10 of Leverett, Jessica C. Frisina ’10 of Mather, Gerald C. Tiu ’10 of Winthrop, Adam S. Travis ’10 of Mather, and Devon A. Youngblood ’10 of Mather will each receive $18,000 to spend the year after graduation on “purposeful” international travel.
The Rockefeller fellowship encourages independent immersion experiences rather than research or formal study.
“By being in a new culture, we mean really meeting people and having experiences with them day-to-day, without being able to go back and enjoy a hot shower,” said Paul A. Bohlmann, director of fellowships for the Office of Career Services.
Brennan, a government concentrator, will travel to Tanzania next year to study the different perceptions of service to the community among the Maasai and Chagga tribes.
“This is a life-changing moment for me,” Brennan said. “At the end of the experience I’d like to be in a better position to help people and know how the best way to do that is.”
Youngblood plans to compare her own experiences with race and cultural identity in America to the experiences of the artistic community in Egypt.
The independent nature of the fellowship attracted Youngblood, who designed her own special concentration studying the multidisciplinary nature of the visual world.
Travis, also traveling to Africa, will investigate the role of schooling in mediating intertribal and racial violence in Kenya.
Fan will spend her year in Peru exploring how its multi-ethnic culture is represented through food. Fan, who came to her interest in food by throwing dinner parties with her roommates, plans to work at a restaurant in Lima.
Although a neurobiology concentrator, Fan said she hopes to explore other fields during her fellowship.
“For the first time, what I’m doing next year is not for an investment for future payoff,” she said. “But I’m doing it to be happy every day.”
Frisina, a History and Literature concentrator, will explore how education is used to create a sense of community at a Honduran orphanage.
She said her interest in education stems from time spent with the Mission Hill After School Program, and she is considering integrating a focus on education into her future plans to become a lawyer.
Tiu, who is concentrating in Chemical and Physical Biology, plans to spend his year in China studying how socioeconomic and social stigma affect HIV/AIDS patients.
Tiu said he wanted to explore his own Burmese heritage by focusing on the status of Burmese refugees in Southern China.
While Tiu is currently set on pursuing a joint M.D./Ph.D degree, he said that he sees next year as an opportunity to explore his growing interest in public health.

The Alavi Foundation, a non-profit organization that has funded various Harvard programs in Middle Eastern culture and language, faced formal allegations from the U.S. government earlier this month that they had illegally given money and services to the Iranian government in violation of laws that regulate trade with Iran.
The foundation, which provides donations to colleges to promote Islamic education, denies the charges, according to a report from the New York Times.
The foundation referred media inquiries to its lawyer, who could not be reached for comment yesterday.
The grants received from the Alavi Foundation have funded programs at both Harvard College and Harvard Law School and have been spent to promote the academic purposes of the University.
The funds partially cover expenses for programs in Middle Eastern culture, language instruction, and legal studies, according to a statement released by Harvard yesterday.
“The grants...have been spent solely for purposes in furtherance of Harvard’s academic mission” said Harvard spokesman Kevin Galvin.
Media reports questioning the legitimacy of the organization go back as far as 2003, when the Washington Post reported that federal instigators were looking into the organization.
Yet the investigations have only recently led to formal allegations and the government seizure of the Alavi Foundation’s New York-based real estate holdings.
Galvin said that Harvard officials were not aware of the Alavi Foundation’s alleged ties to the Iranian government before the recent press reports were published.
One recipient of the Alavi Foundation’s grants, the faculty at the Center for Middle Eastern Studies, is concerned about the consequences of the recent accusations levelled by the government.
“[The Alavi Foundation] provides money to the Center for Middle Eastern Studies, so there was some feeling that you might lose that money,” said Middle East History Professor E. Roger Owen.
But despite the recent accusations, President of the Harvard Islamic Society Na’eel Cajee ’10 said he believes that it is important to step back from the issue and remain objective until more details are uncovered.
“Any comment made at this point is mere conjecture about a long standing donor to an academic program,“ Cajee said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Raymond Traietti, a parent of a student attending Cambridge Public School, wrote in an e-mail to a school official that he was “frustrated” with the school assignment process.
His family listed three schools as their top choices, with proximity as the deciding factor. But their son was assigned the public school that was “absolutely furthest away from where [they] live.”
They are one of many families that has faced mandatory assignment due to the controversial controlled choice process, a procedure debated at an informal roundtable discussion with the CPS committee last night.
Parag A. Pathak ’02, an assistant professor of economics at MIT, presented his recommendations for amending the “first choice maximization” algorithm that currently determines assignment. According to Pathak, changing the system will reduce the gambling involved in the process, increase transparency in school assignment, and up the level of parental satisfaction.
Currently, applicants with siblings and those within a certain proximity are given priority in school choice. In cases when all these factors are similar, a lottery system is used as a tie breaker.
Traietti’s family did not get any of their three choice schools because they were “overly-demanded” schools.
Stories like theirs have reportedly led some families to strategize by listing schools in lower demand as their top choices instead of their true preferences.
“What’s the point of having people list schools and calling the process ‘School Choice’ if there is no choice in the matter,” Traietti said. “How are we to know that we have to ‘play’ the process by what schools to list?”
Last night, Pathak presented his new model of the system in an effort to decrease the mistrust and “strategizing” in the process. His ideas stem from his own previous experience in New York and Boston Public Schools. This “strategy-proof algorithm,” where parents are not penalized for ranking overly-demanded schools, would endorse honest ranking, he said.
The percentage of students receiving their first choice, which is currently at a high 87 percent, might be overstated, he said, since they may only be getting their stated first choice.
Pathak suggested that the process should allow “seat swapping.” In this algorithm, students can either keep their assignment if it is truly their top choice school, or request a trade if it is not.
“We want a system that people think is fair and they can participate in,” Pathak said. “The primary goal of the new algorithm, school committee members agree, is to ‘level the playing field.’”
Socioeconomic and racial imbalances are not directly affected by the proposed chances and are not anticipated to change drastically, if at all.
School committee member Luc D. Schuster said that “it’s going to take some time for parents to think we’ve changed the system.” Mark C. McGovern, another committee member, agreed that “the groundwork needs to be laid out properly.”
The algorithm is unlikely to be implemented this school year, according to the committee.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Psychology Professor Steven A. Pinker’s review of Malcolm Gladwell’s most recent book “What the Dog Saw: And Other Adventures” ignited a heated public debate between the two prolific authors last week.
Pinker’s book review, published on Nov. 7 in the New York Times, gave Gladwell’s new book a lukewarm reception. He praised Gladwell for aspects of the work, but criticized his lack of knowledge of statistics and psychology and his use of “banal” generalizations.
An acclaimed journalist and author of a number of bestsellers including “Blink” and “Tipping Point,” Gladwell’s new book is a collection of essays on topics ranging from the origins of ketchup to the inspiration for Led Zeppelin’s music.
In the review, Pinker describes Gladwell as “a minor genius who unwittingly demonstrates the hazards of statistical reasoning and who occasionally blunders into spectacular failures.”
Pinker, himself author of a number of popular texts on cognitive psychology including “How the Mind Works,” argues against Gladwell’s claim that I.Q. scores are not good predictors of success in the job market.
The review touched off a series of responses and rebuttals published by the New York Times in the form of letters to the editor. Gladwell’s response defended the accuracy of his essays and criticized Pinker for using a source he referred to as “a California blogger...who is perhaps best known for his belief that black people are intellectually inferior to white people.”
He also defended his stance on the inability of I.Q. scores to predict future success and called Pinker’s defense of the I.Q. score “the lonely ice floe of I.Q. fundamentalism.”
In his response, Pinker admitted that at least on the subject of sports, he was forced to turn to the “army of statistics-savvy amateurs” in the blogosphere. But he wrote that “what Malcolm Gladwell calls a ‘lonely ice floe’ is what psychologists call ‘the mainstream’.”
The New York Times will publish the exchange of letters in the Nov. 29 print edition.
Both Gladwell and Pinker declined to comment for this article.

In anticipation of the issues that will be raised at the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference, the Harvard Center for Health and the Global Environment (HCHGE) participated in a briefing last Friday on Capitol Hill.
HCHGE Associate Director Paul R. Epstein outlined the possible health implications of climate change in the United States, accompanied by representatives from the American Medical Association, the American Nurses Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Public Health Association.
“This was the first time [these four organizations] have come together speaking with one voice on the threats of climate change,” said Epstein. “This was a monumental event from our perspective.”
In order to urge policymakers to act, participants in the briefing cited the results of numerous studies conducted by researchers at Harvard Medical School.
Epstein added that the mission of research at the HCHGE “is to call attention to the health dimensions of global environmental change.”
Fact sheets culled from Harvard Medical School studies were used at the recent Congressional briefing. They are available online and provide a summary of adverse effects of climate-related health concerns that either have occurred or are projected to occur across the United States.
One fact sheet states that “more respiratory disease, heart disease and death from heat waves are projected.” The study predicts that the frequency, duration and extent of heat waves will increase with global warming and that events such as the 10-day Chicago heat wave—which resulted in 738 deaths in June of 1995­—will become more common.
The research also predicts that “prolonged asthma and allergy seasons” will result from heat wave-related increases in ground-level ozone, higher ragweed pollen counts, and particulates emitted from the combustion of fossil fuels.
Moreover, the studies state that infectious diseases will become more prevalent if climate change continues unabated. The report states that stinging insects will expand their geographical reach and that tick-borne diseases such as Lyme disease and Ehrlichiosis will also be on the rise.
The fact sheets also cover nutritional concerns, observing that “crops face growing stresses from volatile weather and...pathogens” because heavy precipitation—induced by changes in climate patterns—fosters fungi growth, a major cause of crop loss.
Epstein did remain optimistic when he concluded that “a set of complementary solutions that are good for public health,” if adopted by the U.S. government, could combat the bleak findings of the studies.

Evidence pointing to excessive risk-taking by executives at investment banks Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers continues to emerge more than a year after the two investment banks collapsed in 2008—this time from a paper released online this weekend by three Harvard Law School affiliates.
According to the study, the collapse of the two firms reflected not shortsightedness on the part of top executives, but rather compensation structures that shielded the executives from the consequences of the firms’ economic meltdown. Compensation structures of cash bonuses and equity options liquid regardless of the firm’s financial state led to sustained profits for these executives even after the financial collapse.
The study was authored by Harvard Law School Professor Lucian A. Bebchuk, Holger Spamann, a lecturer at the Law School, and Alma Cohen, a visiting law professor from Tel Aviv University. The authors attempt to dispel what they call the “standard narrative of the meltdown” that does not give payment schemes a leading role in the financial crisis of 2008.
“Our work seeks to contribute to this ongoing examination. We do by showing that the examples of Bear Stearns and Lehman should not be used as a basis for dismissing the potential role of compensation structures in past risk-taking and the potential value of fixing such structures,” Bebchuk wrote in an e-mailed statement to The Crimson.
The study’s conclusions come less than a week after the heads of two major banks wrote editorial pieces in The Washington Post and the Sunday Telegraph calling for greater regulation and accountability in light of the financial crisis.
JPMorgan Chase CEO and Harvard Business School graduate Jamie Dimon wrote in The Washington Post on Nov. 13 that regulators should be empowered to liquidate assets and fire management when they see fit, so that individuals engaging in risky behavior will “feel the pain.” The next day, Barclays CEO John S. Varley wrote in The Sunday Telegraph that “incentives and compensation must be better aligned to delivery, must take account of risk, and must be paid out over time.”
Dimon and Varley’s editorials point to a broadening consensus that a reform of the financial services industry is necessary. But Lawrence White, a  professor of economics at the Leonard Stern School of Business at New York University, questioned whether this most recent study has added new insights to the debate.
“It didn’t feel to me like the study was telling us a lot other than reminding us that there weren’t clawbacks and that these guys aren’t paupers, but who really thought they were?” he said.
Still, he said that “better corporate governance, more shareholder control is an important thing. That doesn’t necessarily mean less risk-taking, but smarter risk-taking.”

The role digital communication played in this summer’s Green Movement in Iran suggests that tools like Twitter will increasingly acquire a pivotal role in breaking news reporting, said speakers at a talk hosted yesterday by Harvard’s Berkman Center for Internet and Society.
“There is a real potential to build a global movement around digital freedom,” said Brett Solomon, a speaker at the event who serves as a campaign director at online human rights group Avaaz.org and as executive director of the political Web site GetUp.org.au.
Solomon and Cameran Ashraf, an adjunct faculty member at California State University, Pomona, discussed how Twitter updates were able to increase communication.
Ashraf mentioned the example of demonstrators involved with Iran’s Green Movement, which sought last summer to overturn election results that many viewed as potentially fraudulent.
According to Ashraf, after people began protesting the election results, the government drastically limited Internet speeds.
But Twitter, which allows its users to post 140 character status updates, provided a fast outlet for information transfer.
The technology helped organizers continue the protests despite the government’s efforts to curtail digital communication.
As Twitter users “tweeted” updates on the situation in Iran, such as how the government was trying to quell the protests, American networks like CNN also began relying on Twitter as a source for information, Ashraf said.
Over 480,000 Twitter users participated in spreading information about the status of post-election Iran, Ashraf said.
Ashraf praised digital media’s ability to unite such a broad group of people.
“It brought digital activists together who didn’t know each other but who had a common interest,” he said. “The Green Movement took a hydra-like approach to this, which is brilliant—everybody was a leader.”
But Ashraf did express frustration at the international response to the Green Movement.
Public attention transitioned rapidly from intense interest to apparent indifference immediately after news broke of the death of pop star Michael Jackson.

Harvard’s green efforts at the Harvard vs. Princeton football game in October landed it in third place in the 2009 Game Day Challenge sponsored by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, marking a growing partnership between the athletics center and sustainability advocates at Harvard.
The pilot EPA competition measured various aspects of the Universities’ green efforts at the athletic game of their choosing.
Harvard, which represented the Ivy League, took first place in the Per Capita Recycling competition, just edging out the University of Colorado and Ohio University.
“Overall, I am really happy with how it turned out,” said Alyssa H. Devlin ’11, a representative of the Athletics Eco Resource Efficiency Program who also helped to lead the project.
Devlin led the collaborative effort among House Eco representatives to pass out blue and black trash bags to tailgaters at the October football game and increase awareness about Harvard’s sustainability efforts. “A lot of people at the tailgate know that we are here to recycle, so now they expect us,” she said.
Though the Game Day Challenge was not athletic, it spurred athletic spirit among some, including Robert Gogan, a leader in the project and a recycling manager for the University’s Facilities Maintenance Operations.
“This is a gratifying step forward—getting a kick out of beating Ohio University,” he said, referring to Ohio’s loss to Harvard in the Per Capital Recycling category of the challenge. He noted that Ohio University had defeated Harvard in a previous recycling competition. “We felt like underdogs to them ever since,” Gogan said. “Next year, if Yale signs up, I look forward to being happy that we beat [them].”
Despite the hype among sustainability advocates, Devlin says that visibility among the larger student population is the most challenging aspect of the recycling efforts. “The hardest thing is getting students to know what is going on,” she said. But, as one of the only student leaders on the competition’s team, Devlin called the Game Day Challenge “one step toward raising awareness.”
According to Gogan, sustainability advocates face a slew of challenges including bringing concession operators and an outside contractor—Cambridge Landscaping—which the University hired to dispose of waste at games, in line with University-wide recycling efforts.
Still, Devlin called this year’s game a learning experience that caused her to realize that “there are a lot of structural things that need to get done first,” in order to fully integrate recycling into Harvard’s game-day experience.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a night of disappointment for the Harvard women’s basketball team after its near comeback was foiled by the University of New Hampshire (3-1) last night.
After a slow start to the game, the Crimson (2-2) had a successful run in the second half that led to an overtime with the Wildcats.
But the effort did not prove to be enough as Harvard was defeated 78-65 at the end of the overtime period.
“We’re pretty disappointed again,” Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “We thought we could win this one, but instead we’re leaving with an overtime loss.”
Junior Emma Markley led Harvard with 21 points, but New Hampshire had the momentum from the opening whistle, jumping out to an early 15-3 lead.
The Crimson, on the other hand, had trouble putting points on the scoreboard.
“We started shooting poorly in the first half and that got under our skin,” Delaney-Smith said. “But we just can’t get discouraged so quickly, we have too many other ways to put the ball in the basket.”
“Inconsistency was definitely an issue throughout the game,” junior forward Jackie Alemany said. “We miss a few shots and we get down–it’s just not smart basketball.”
In the opening half, Harvard shot a dismal 16.7 percent from the field and was 0-7 from behind the three-point line.
Its first field goal did not come until 8:48 left in the half, off of a basket from Markley.
The Crimson was able to gain some ground thanks to Wildcat fouls late in the first half.
In the final six minutes of the period, Harvard appeared at the foul line five times–picking up seven points from the stripe–to begin closing the double-digit scoring gap.
At the end of the opening half, the Crimson had recovered to make it a 29-20 game.
And Harvard, propelled by a three-point play by Markley with less than 30 seconds left, carried all the momentum into the locker room.
“We came out in the first half and had a low shooting percentage, but we were able to come back from a big deficit,” Alemany said.
Unlike the first half, the Crimson took control in the opening minutes of the second period, and pulled to within three after a steal and layup from Alemany.
The early rally did not last, though, as New Hampshire reestablished its double digit lead off of a three pointer and shots from the foul line.
But Harvard had one last run to make, an admirable second half comeback that unfortunately was overshadowed by the loss.
Started by a three-point shot from junior co-captain Christine Matera, the comeback consisted of a 14-2 Crimson run that tied the game at 53 with 3:43 left on the clock in regulation. Harvard gained its first lead of the game with just over three minutes to play courtesy of a three-pointer from sophomore point guard Brogan Berry. With three seconds left in the second half and the Crimson ahead by one point, the Wildcats sent the game into overtime after making the second shot of a pair of free throws.
“That was a great comeback in the second half,” Delaney-Smith said. “It showed the fight we had.”
But Harvard lost its fight in overtime, as the Crimson was outscored 20-7 in the extra period.
Overtime began with three defensive errors from Harvard and a pair of threes from New Hampshire. The momentum that the Crimson had gained throughout the second half withered into a disappointing overtime performance.
“UNH appeared to want it a little more than we did,” Delaney-Smith said.
After a night plagued by inconsistency, Harvard will hope to recall the spark it had for the final few minutes of the second half but sustain it for entire games, rather than just flashes.
“The comeback was one of the main points of the game where we really came together,” Matera said. “But we need that the whole 40 minutes.”

Clinging to a 5-4 lead, all the Harvard men’s hockey team had to do was hold on for one final minute to knock off the defending NCAA Champions.
But a goal from BU senior Zach Cohen with 19.5 seconds left in regulation sent the game into overtime, where sophomore Chris Connolly gave the Terriers (5-7-2, 2-6-1 Hockey East) a 6-5 win.
The comeback victory spoiled a career night by freshman Conor Morrison, who scored four goals for the Crimson (1-5-2, 1-4-2 ECAC).
Down by one with less than a minute remaining, BU pulled its goalie for one last surge. With five Harvard skaters crowding the net, the Terriers sent a puck into the crease, leading to a scramble in front of junior goaltender Kyle Richter. After David Warsofsky’s shot was blocked, Cohen controlled the puck just long enough to put it past Richter.
The Crimson had been able to respond to BU’s previous goals, but the Cohen tally proved to be the backbreaker.
“When you score late you sort of have the momentum going into overtime and we certainly had that,” Terrier coach Jack Parker said.
A little under three minutes into the extra period, BU ended the contest. The game-winning goal emerged from an attempted wrap-around shot. The play drew Richter out, leaving Connolly free on the backside. When the shot missed the target and floated to Connolly, the forward had a clear look on goal.
“I got lucky,” Connolly said. “It popped right there and it was a wide open net.”
The Crimson had been outscored 15-4 in the third period heading into the game. The BU loss only added to the trend that has defined the season thus far.
“I think there’s no question we need to defend better, protect leads,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91. “This wasn’t the first time it’s happened.”
The end result overshadowed a back-and-forth game in which the Crimson was able to respond to each of BU’s first four goals with tallies of its own, despite being outshot 49-26.
“They generated a lot of shots,” Donato said. “We kept answering back with goals.”
The Terriers struck first, with Joe Pereira scoring less than four minutes into the game. The Crimson, entering with a six-game winless streak, struggled to match BU’s speed early.
But Morrison and sophomore Alex Killorn scored back-to-back goals to give Harvard a 2-1 lead. The freshman was the first on the board. A battle in the left corner of BU’s zone sent the puck in front of the Terrier goal, where Morrison was able to recover possession and beat BU goaltender Kieran Millan.
Killorn scored the second goal on a seemingly harmless shot from the left side. Millan was caught unprepared, and the puck bounced off the goaltender’s shoulder into the back of the net.
The Crimson would not be behind on the scoreboard again until Connolly’s overtime goal.
“We never got another go-ahead goal,” Parker said. “We had to keep coming from behind.”
But Harvard was never able to establish a comfortable lead, as Cohen got his first goal of the day with four minutes left in the first period—the only goal the Terriers registered during a major penalty by freshman Brendan Rempel.
The Crimson, which had matched BU shot-for-shot in the first period, slowed down in the second, getting outshot 14-6. The Terriers would outshoot Harvard for the remainder of the contest, but every time they tied the game, Morrison scored to give the Crimson a one-goal lead.
“Nobody wanted to give up anything,” Parker said.
Both teams’ seasons have been disappointing thus far. While BU may have broken its dry spell, Harvard extended its winless streak to seven. Its next chance to get a victory is Sunday against Dartmouth.
“Both teams were starving for a win,” Donato said.
Only the Terriers were able to go home full.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Boston University forward Chris Connolly described the play of Harvard freshman Conor Morrison best.
“Unbelievable,” Connolly said. “He had a great night. The puck was on his stick all night, and he was burying his chances.”
Morrison, who scored four goals in a losing effort, was 20 seconds away from single-handedly beating BU, the defending NCAA Champions. He is the first Crimson player to score four goals in a game since Chris Bala accomplished the feat in 1998.
Before last night’s game, Morrison had one goal on the season. His offensive outburst now makes him Harvard’s leading goalscorer.
But BU’s 6-5 comeback win soured what was a career night for the rookie.
“I mean, we’ve been on kind of a rough stretch, so it’s tough to lose like that,” Morrison said. “At the same time, it was a special night for me, so I’ll be happy but not satisfied.”
For his first two goals, the freshman benefited from being in the right place at the right time.
He notched his first tally on a play where a referee deflected the puck with his skate, and he grabbed his second on a rebound.
But to complete the hat trick, Morrison added some of his own flair—he sped past a BU forward along the boards, cut inside toward the Terrier net, and then flipped a backhander into the goal.
Morrison finished the night with what seemed to be the game-winning tally with a minute remaining in the third period.
“He’s a talented guy. When he gets opportunities, he knows what to do with them,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91. “I’m very happy for him, obviously. It was a big boost to our team to have him step up and have a great game.”
SHOOTING AT GOLIATH
Although the Crimson found itself on the losing end, the battle with BU provides a glimmer of hope for a team that is currently in the midst of a seven-game winless streak. The Terriers are the defending NCAA Champions and, according to BU coach Jack Parker, played one of its best games of the year last night.
The Terriers have struggled this season, compiling a record of 4-7-1, and have been plagued by inconsistency and injuries.
The strong performance against Harvard was a surprise, primarily because it came immediately after Parker reprimanded his team for a lackluster practice the day before.
“I think [the win] was huge, especially after what happened yesterday at practice,” BU forward Joe Pereira said. “We had a stinker.”
POWER GENERATOR
The Terriers put the power in power play last night, taking advantage early of Crimson penalties.
BU converted on their first three attempts by moving the puck quickly, finding open shooting lanes, and cleaning up rebounds.
Pereira scored two of the BU power play goals and Zach Cohen scored the third after redirecting a slap shot past Richter.
Cohen’s goal came during an advantage created by a five-minute major penalty for boarding by freshman Brendan Rempel.
“I was really pleased with [the power play],” Parker said. “In general, we did a good job with special teams and we did a good job in our zone. When you go out on the road and you outshoot a team that’s as fast and as clever as this club…that’s what I was looking for and that’s what I was hoping for.”
The BU coaching staff made strategy adjustments for the team’s power play in order to deal with Harvard’s aggressive penalty kill. The changes resulted in many opportunities and several open looks on net.
“We changed our power play around quite a bit for this game and it really paid off,” Parker said. “Harvard really likes to pressure you...when we’re playing an umbrella like we do, it’s easy to chase us, so we changed it—a little different look.”
“We stretched them out pretty good,” he added. “They wound up settling down, quieting down, and that’s when we got some opportunities.”

On Tuesday, Yard Ops sent out the following e-mail vaguely notifying select freshman students of a “tour” that may be coming through their rooms today—without their consent:
Hello all, 
If you are receiving this email, it is to notify you that on Wednesday, November 25, between 3 and 5 p.m., it is possible your suite may be included in a building tour. If your suite is chosen, the visit should not exceed 5 minutes. You do not need to be home, however the tour group will knock before entering, in case you are.  Best and thank you in advance for your cooperation. 
Yard Ops
The prospect of this “tour” may conjure up images of the throngs of tourists that inundate the Yard, but Freshmen Dorms Manager Anthony Pacillo told us it is merely a building inspection that will be performed by three Harvard employees.
Holworthy resident Christopher A. Devine ’13, one of the e-mail's recipients, expressed his concerns about the message's ambiguity. "They should have told us whether it was a 50 person tour group or three people checking building maintenance coming into our rooms,” he said.
Well, maybe Yard Ops should take Expos 20 too.
