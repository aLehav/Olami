“Bob’s Burgers” is the best show on television; sadly, that likely means it will soon be prematurely cancelled by Fox and consigned to limbo until Netflix revives it in seven years. The animated tale of a middle-class family (not the Simpsons) struggling to run a burger joint, Bob’s Burgers features voice-acting veteran H. Jon Benjamin as Bob Belcher, the family patriarch. His wife Linda (John Roberts), and children Tina (Dan Mintz), Gene (Eugene Mirman), and Louise (Kristen Schaal) round out the cast, along with recurring guest stars such as Sarah and Laura Silverman and Aziz Ansari. The show’s ensemble cast is bolstered by strong writing, and its abundance of throwaway one-liners and clever riffing make it a worthy rival of “Arrested Development.” So without further ado, here are the top 4 quotes from the show:
 
1. Season 1, Episode 8: Art Crawl: The Silverman sisters kill it as Andy and Ollie, the dimwitted but lovable sidekicks of the Belcher family who redefine “creepy twins.”
Ollie: Do you think she’s coming back?
Andy: I don’t know! I’m so cold.
Ollie: Cut me open and crawl inside me. One of us should live.
Andy: Okay!
 
2. Season 2, Episode 3: Synchronized Swimming: Although she’s the youngest Belcher, Louise’s strong personality and sociopathic tendencies make her veritable force to be reckoned with in any situation.
P.E. Teacher: I told you, Louise, no hats in PE!
Louise: And I told you I have a raging staph infection under here. Touch this hat and we all go down! You wanna play dodgeball in the hospital?
 
3. Season 2, Episode 5: Food Truckin’: Gene’s the goofball middle child of the family who constantly deadpans explicit or vulgar remarks, though he throws in a surprisingly mature line now and then.
Bob: Say goodbye to the trucks, kids, because tomorrow we are taking back the street.
Gene: And taking back the night! Respect for women! My body, my rules!
 
4. Season 3, Episode 17: Two for Tina: As the awkward teenager of the family, Tina’s life struggles solely involve hormones and boys, so it’s no surprise that her love interests are just as cringe-worthy as she is.
Josh: Get it? I literally picked you up.
Tina: It was like being on a romantic stool.
Josh: Yeah, well, that was just a stool sample. There’s more where that came from.

2013 was an undeniably real year for hip-hop. From the continued existence of Kanye West to the enduring excellence of Kanye West, this year was one of true dynamism in the rap game. As The Crimson’s resident expert on Western philosophy, I will guide you through the 10 truest moments in the genre.
 
10. “On Sight” - Kanye West 
Especially when the surgically sharp synths of the verse and chorus fall away to an angelic chorus of children’s voices singing their willingness to accept the good news of Yeezus.
 
9. “Black Skinhead” - Kanye West 
 West’s aggression reaches new heights of intimacy as he gasps and pants over a hideously distorted bassline—a reminder that while he may be larger than life, he has never been more in your face.
 
8. “I Am A God” - Kanye West 
 It is in this moment that West establishes his divine mandate, as Christ himself casually calls out “What up, Yeezus?” to his friend and colleague.
 
7. “New Slaves” - Kanye West 
If you ever encounter me in real life, remind me of this outro to see a grown man cry.
 
6. “Hold My Liquor” - Kanye West 
The cracks in West’s flinty exterior begin to widen here, as he exposes some vulnerability and that same insecurity that made “808s and Heartbreak” such a heartbreakingly confessional affair. 
 
5. “I’m In It” - Kanye West 
Perhaps worried that divulgence is an unflattering color, West reassures us here that he is up to his usual tricks—namely, “eating Asian pussy, all I need was sweet and sour sauce.”
 
4. “Blood On The Leaves” - Kanye West 
The otherworldly combination of West’s autotuned vocals, a grossly pitched-up sample of Nina Simone’s “Strange Fruit,” and a catastrophically heavy sample from TNGHT’s “R U Ready” creates a sonic experience so devastating in its originality that it seems unreal. So unreal that it is 2013’s fourth realest moment in hip-hop.
 
3. “Guilt Trip” - Kanye West 
If there were nothing to Kanye West other than his bravado, then people would be right to criticize him. But that’s not true, and they are wrong. As Kid Cudi croons “If you loved me so much, then why’d you let me go?” it becomes clearer that West—and his work—deserve more than a chuckle and dismissal.
 
2. “Send It Up” - Kanye West 
West’s strangely roundabout way of informing a girl that he will not get her friends into the club is one of the most compelling moments in hip-hop, if not all art.
 
1. “Bound 2” - Kanye West 
 This song is an expression of pure glee from that most famous of scowlers. This is a rare glimpse into the man that only a few people know, the one that pop culture has done its best to drive into hiding. This is West exalting in somebody else, a genuinely beautiful moment where his intensely creative self and inescapably emotional self coexist. This is West in love, this is West loved, and this is West’s love.

Nothing dates an era quite as well as its slang. By the time an informal word enters a mainstream English dictionary, it's been around the metaphorical mass media block and packs some serious pop culture punch. Here are the best “new” words of 2013, in chronological order of their entry into the ranks of the Oxford and Merriam-Webster Dictionaries.
The play-by-play:
 
February 2013: The Oxford Dictionaries Online opens its doors to “friend zone,” “tweetable,” and “flexitarian” (“a person who has a primarily vegetarian diet but occasionally eats meat or fish”).
May 2013: ODO jumps on the Snapchat bandwagon and extends a dictionary welcome to “screencap.”
 
August 2013: American dictionary staple Merriam-Webster announces its new additions, which include “twerking” (“dance to popular music involving thrusting hip movements and a low, squatting stance”), “derp” (“meaningless or stupid”), “selfie,” and “squee” (“used to express great delight”). Other 2013 Merriam-Webster inclusions are “jorts,” “vom,” “food baby,” and “FOMO,” short for “Fear of Missing Out.”
 
“Phablet” (“a smartphone having a screen which is intermediate in size between that of a typical smartphone and a tablet computer”), “digital detox,” “srsly,” and “hackerspace” enter ODO’s digital lexicon in August.
 
November 2013: ODO expands to include “merch,” the blog-related “refollow,” and the dated staple “vacay.”
 
Last week, the Oxford Dictionaries Online announced its Word of the Year for 2013: “selfie.” The Global Language Monitor, which projects the number of words in the English language to hit 1,025,109 in 2014, found that the most common words used on the internet this year included “fail,” “hashtag,” “deficit,” and “surveillance.”
 
Taken together, this year's recognized neologisms, many of which already sound dated, paint a picture of 2013’s English speakers as tech-driven, self-absorbed, and touched by underlying social and political anxiety. We can only hope 2014's slang concoctions suggest a society that is less neurotic and wary but no less creative and wacky than its 2013 predecessor.
 –Staff writer and outgoing Campus Arts Executive Ola Topczewska thinks no one does neologisms better than the Bard. Cred goes to Will for "tardiness," "skim milk," "foppish," "unbosom," and "batty" (we kid ye not). Ola can be reached at ola.topczewska@thecrimson.com.

Long gone are the days of the clean-shaven man. No more do we find ourselves staring longingly at the smooth faced boy toys from the cover of Tiger Beat magazine. In place of these polished faces, the scruff has emerged. And not just scruff—beards. Power beards. As a girl who fluctuates between dreaming about a future spent in a posh New York apartment and a life spent in a log cabin with my lumberjack lover, I’m not going to lie—I love the beards. So here’s to the best and most powerful beards of 2013. 
Walter White: Because how can you talk about anything without talking about “Breaking Bad” these days. This little goatee of power rocked our worlds and transformed a timid school teacher into a hardboiled drug dealer. As his criminal prowess grew, so did the beard. Walter showed us that the manly power of a beard cannot be questioned.
The Red Sox. All of them: If anyone doubted the power of the beard, he or she was proven wrong when the Red Sox took the victory in the World Series. Was it years of training and dedication? Psh. No. We all know it was the beards.
Liam Hemsworth: He made it through Miley. Not because he has a strong emotional core or lots of family support. He made it because he was able to wake up every morning and be greeted by that beautiful animal living on his face. I was personally sad to see it go for “The Hunger Games: Mockingjay—Part 1,” but perhaps after this round of filming he’ll bring it back. And if he doesn’t, he’s still Liam Hemsworth.
Tobey Maguire: He may have had a claim to Spidey powers for over a decade, but now he may finally be able to order a drink without getting carded. This guy no longer looks like a very tired high school student, and I think we all know the beard is to thank for that. Take note, young men everywhere.
Jon Hamm: As if Hamm needed any more proof of his masculinity and, um, power, this outburst of manliness has taken over his face and my heart. He looks exactly like the lumberjack of my dreams. The verdict is still out, however, on whether or not he put down a payment on our cabin.

This is a list of the most built-up yet oddly unfulfilling moments in theater—the anticlimax. They are also some of my favorite moments in plays and musicals, because it is often in these instances that the rawest form of reality sneaks its way onto the stage. It is in these moments that the goal of theater is truly fulfilled: the characters finally cross over from the realm of fiction and become human for the audience.
 
5. Act III of “Our Town,” by Thornton Wilder, when the main character dies and returns to Earth to learn that many of her close family and friends have already passed away. She tries to relive a day in her past, but finds it too painful, ultimately returning to death and lamenting that humans do not seem to enjoy life while they have it.
 
4. The moment in “Annie” when she found out that her real parents, the ones who gave her the locket, died in a car accident when she was a baby. I don’t know about you, but I totally thought “Daddy” Warbucks was going to end up being her biological father, with Grace as her mother.
 
3. The end of the first act of “Hair,” when the Tribe strips naked on stage. It’s a bold undertaking even with dim lighting, but what’s anticlimactic about this scene is that the members of the Tribe stand, singing “Let the Sun Shine In,” as if they were wearing clothing. Nakedness becomes the new normal, and the audience begins to feel silly and trapped in their ridiculous clothing.
 
2. The very end of “Ragtime,” after Father convinces Coalhouse to surrender peacefully and exit the library that Coalhouse is threatening to blow to pieces. The police shoot and kill the former rabble-rouser, and he is dead before his peaceful intentions can be made known. The fight to combat race violence is robbed of an angry but powerful voice. Still, Coalhouse’s song “Make them Hear You” echoes after the smoke from the gunshot clears.
 1. The ending of “Pippin,” when the Leading Player tears down the set and leaves Pippin to face the bare stage and blinking exit sign. He must then live the rest of his life without the fluff, feathers, or frippery of the theater and with only the promise of a loving and meaningful human relationship with his lover Catherine.

2013 has been a banner year for representations of women in popular music. While some artists (most notably Lily Allen) have clearly hibernated through this cessation of sexist discrimination in pop culture, a select few men have taken it upon themselves to illuminate this happening to their female audiences. The end of sexism is here, and as we wrap up the year, let’s celebrate these five artists who broke the news.
 
5. Sean Kingston ft. Chris Brown—”Beat It”
 
I know I can’t be alone in saying that I missed Chris Brown! Sean Kingston intelligently features America’s best-known domestic abuser on this cleverly titled track, and with him, shows that violence is completely acceptable behavior. As the song’s masterfully composed lyrics demonstrate, she’s just “wanting [him] to beat it”!
 
4. Justin Timberlake—“Take Back the Night”
 
Come on, ladies. Groups like Take Back the Night have it all wrong. It’s up to us to stop rape by dressing modestly, not by changing male behavior. Timberlake realizes how necessary it is to trivialize the messages of these misguided organizations; after all, if men “know” when we “feel it,” they can’t possibly rape us.
 
3. Eminem ft. Kendrick Lamar—“Love Game”
 
Though it perhaps doesn’t give us the level of creative achievement attained by Eminem’s reclamation of the word “faggot” in “Rap God,” “Love Game” still gives us plenty to talk about. Eminem and Kendrick Lamar both demonstrate the dangerous nature of female sexuality, the former by listing the several men the song’s female subject has slept with, the latter by simply stating “I’m a sucker for love, you’re a sucker for dick.”
 
2. Rocko ft. Future and Rick Ross—“U. O. E. N. O.”
 
Sometimes, women are wrong. Sometimes, we need a bit of help from the superior, smarter sex. In “U. O. E. N. O.,” that help comes in the form of Rick Ross “put[ting] Molly all in her champagne.” Ross is clearly a man who knows how to handle that inconvenient female weakness of thinking she can make her own decisions about sex.
 
1. Robin Thicke ft. T.I. and Pharrell—“Blurred Lines”
 
If Robin Thicke doesn’t follow in Gloria Steinem’s footsteps and receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom in the next few years, then I’m no longer to be taken seriously. He empowers the female subject of his magnum opus to “let [him] liberate [her],” augments her self-esteem by telling her she is a “good girl,” and finally obliterates sexism once and for all by “blurring” the “lines” between men and women (and not, as some ignorami have claimed, between sex and rape). Bravo, Thicke. You’ve accomplished for us women what we never could have done ourselves.

“Breaking Bad” creator Vince Gilligan extended the run times of the series’ finale two episodes by almost ten minutes, but that still wasn’t enough time to tie up every loose end. Here are the scenes we would have liked to see in the series finale.
 
1. Before stopping by the Schwartzes’, Walt tracks down everyone’s favorite Car Wash Ceausescu, Bogdan, and smothers him in his sleep with a crustless ham sandwich.
2. Huell finally gets around to finishing “In Search Of Lost Time” while waiting for Hank and Gomie to come back to the safe house.
3. Sales of pine-scented air fresheners at the A1A Car Wash increase moderately due to their new placement next to the 5 Hour Energy drinks.
4. Lydia, dying of ricin poisoning, decides to make the most of her final hours and arranges a blanket hit on everyone who was involved in making “You Don’t Mess with the Zohan” and “Cars 2.”
5. Walt Jr. discovers that Franch dipping sauce goes really well with bacon.
6. Saul Goodman establishes an experimental bodyguard-comedian trade school in Nebraska.
7. Marie steals the Hope Diamond from the Smithsonian because it’s purple and Hank liked rocks.
8. Twaüghthammer’s long-awaited first album, “Vamonos Pest,” receives a 7.2/10 from Pitchfork’s Ian Cohen in a review that uses the phrases “ambassadors of drudgecore,” “Asher Roth-esque,” and “pursuit of the über-Lacanian.”
9. A fifteen minute shot of Skyler smoking and looking surly.
10. The Albuquerque Journal is forced to print an embarrassing retraction after running the headline “Matt Damon Killed In Gunfight At Neo-Nazi Compound.”
11. Ted Beneke finally completes “Fabrications,” his debut poetry collection that he wrote by strategically arching his right eyebrow at someone repeatedly reading the alphabet.

Musicals may be the pinnacle of artistic ingenuity. Displaying a unique cross-section between drama, dance, and singing, musicals use songs to tap into human emotion in the most spectacular way. This is a list of the top five most climactic songs in musical theatre:
5.   “So Much Better” from “Legally Blonde”: While this musical may not have the same theatrical prestige as the others on the list, it has a special place in my heart. After her ex-boyfriend, Warner, proposes to another woman, Elle questions her decision to attend Harvard Law School until she she realizes she doesn’t need a man.
4.  “The Phantom of the Opera” from “The Phantom of the Opera”: It’s the theme song for a reason. The Phantom takes Christine to his gloomy lair, and the only way to describe the moment is intoxicating. The audience is led down the tunnel, not able to emerge until the final act of the musical.
3.  “Do You Hear the People Sing” from “Les Misérables”: After the death of General Lamarque, Enjolras and Marius leads a group of students in rebellion against the government. What makes the song so exciting is the characters’ passion and strength as they emote, marching towards what is most likely their death.
2. “And I Am Telling You I’m Not Going” from “Dreamgirls”: Whether it is Jennifer Holliday or Jennifer Hudson belting out this iconic song, the emotional devastation of a woman desperate for love and affection hits home every time. After being kicked out of the Dreams, she pleads with Curtis, her lover and manager, to stay by her side. The audience is left with the image of Effie reaching out but no one there to take her hand.
1. “Defying Gravity” from “Wicked”: When Elphaba discovers that the Wizard of Oz is a con man, it is safe to say that she doesn’t take it lying down. Forsaking the Wizard and deciding to become a vigilante, Elphaba soars in the sky declaring her independence, damning herself to be known as the Wicked Witch of the West despite her noble intentions.

15. “Angel on Fire” by Antony & The Johnsons
This mesmerizing and haunting song is terrible for running, unless it is a cold gray day and you want to become one with the atmosphere.
14. “Gale Song” by The Lumineers
Does a song from the lovelorn Gale’s perspective sound like prime running material to you? Surprise: it’s not.
13. “Lean” by The National
The National are certainly capable of rousing songs—see “Abel”—but “Lean” tends toward the sleepier side of their oeuvre and could charitably be called a good yoga song.
12. “Lights” by Phantogram
I keep forgetting that this is even on the soundtrack.
11. “Atlas” by Coldplay
Chris Martin’s soaring vocals are always a thing of wonder, but incessant replays have made “Atlas” a less-than-stellar running song for me. Objectively, “Atlas” is inspirational but nonrhythmic: middle-of-the-road running material.
10. “Mirror” by Ellie Goulding
The quietly experimental “Mirror” wakes up halfway through with “I was the girl who was on fire / only a bird could get much higher.”
9. “Capitol Letter” by Patti Smith
Thanks to a beautiful acoustic intro and Smith’s commanding voice, this song’s quieter tones can still work well for a run.
8. “Everybody Wants to Rule the World” by Lorde
Lorde’s cover of the iconic Tears for Fears song reimagines it as a revolutionary dirge. This creepy, unexpected rendition hits a perfect stride halfway through; if you’re fine with the slower beginning, the payoff is grand.
7. “Place for Us” by Mikky Ekko
Powerful lyrics—“Well, I’m not afraid to die here / but damned if I go on living a lie here”—are undermined by a slightly less catchy chorus, placing this song solidly in the middle of the pack.
6. “Elastic Heart” by Sia ft. The Weeknd & Diplo
Consistently rhythmic and spirited.
5. “We Remain” by Christina Aguilera
“We Remain” has grown on me. It’s unabashedly commercial: big pop for a big movie; contrary to my first impression, that’s not necessarily a bad thing. “So burn me with fire / drown me with rain,” Christina belts. Run, tributes, run!
4. “Shooting Arrows At the Sky” by Santigold
The song is every bit as powerful as its title implies. You’ll feel like a human arrow yourself, released from a bow and sprinting down the Charles.
3. “Devil May Cry” by The Weeknd
The Weeknd plays this song’s hook six times over, and each time it feels as fresh and angry as before.
2. “Silhouettes” by Of Monsters and Men
The Icelandic band has several other exciting running songs, like “From Finner” and “Your Bones.” “Silhouettes” joins them, starting slow and crescendoing to a perfect leg-pumping beat.
1. “Who We Are” by Imagine Dragons
The band behind the ecstatic hit “Radioactive” returns in this equally motivating song. “We were never welcome here / we were never welcome here at all,” they chant. Don’t worry, Imagine Dragons. You’re more than welcome to come along on a run.
—Staff writer Leanna B. Ehrlich is the outgoing books exec. Her favorite running songs include Foster the People’s “Warrant,” Eric Johnson’s “Cliffs of Dover,” and the entire Lord of the Rings score. When there’s no music to be had, a sunset will do.

Before you ask, the answer is yes, Tree is my real name. Right there on my birth certificate, passport, everything. Why, you wonder? I’ve got a few stories I pull out, depending on who’s asking. But you didn’t come here to read about me, so instead of my own story, here are the seven best trees from throughout popular culture.
 
7. The Giving Tree, “The Giving Tree”
This Shel Silverstein classic is divisive among critics of children’s literature. Is it a touching portrait of altruism or a despicable endorsement of subservience? Either way, the poor tree’s self-sacrifice in the name of love has become inextricable from the children’s literary canon.
 
6. The Whomping Willow, The Harry Potter Series
At first, I thought this tree was a little too mainstream a pick, but I didn’t want to bruise its pride; after all, did you see what it did to the Weasleys’ car?
 
5. Treebeard, the Lord of the Rings trilogy 
“Tree? I am no tree!” Face it, big guy—you’re a tree. Because who’s going to make a “Top 5 Ents” list any time soon? 
 
4. The Kite-Eating Tree, “Peanuts”
Not only is this a standout tree, but it’s also one of the most unrelenting, insidious villains in comics and pop culture at large. Lucy, another bane of poor Charlie Brown’s existence, even let him kick the football a couple times.
 
3. The tree that falls in the forest when nobody’s around to hear it
Does it make a sound? The world may never know. And that’s why this tree is a timeless classic.
 
2. “The Tree of Life”
It’s a nonsensical jumble of CGI dinosaurs, philosophical musings, and Sean Penn staring off into the distance, but it also features beautiful shots of sunlight through the trees. Like, a lot of them. And that’s good enough for me.
 
1. The many trees smoked during the making of Snoop Lion’s “Reincarnated”
It’s no secret that Snoop’s always worked in a weedy haze. Now “Reincarnated” from a lowly canine to a majestic prowler of the savannah, he’s embraced his inner Rasta and released an album of surprisingly enjoyable reggae jams with a mid-puff self-portrait on the cover. I don’t want to know what the studio smells like.

The Crimson Arts board presents its cinematic favorites of the year.
1. Gravity
"Gravity" is not your typical action movie. It excels because it is delicate: the film emphasizes the frailty of human life, the ironic isolation in the vastness of space, and the limits of human endurance. Noteworthy are the beautiful shots of Earth and the convincing depiction of the main character, Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock), as she fights for her life in zero gravity.
In what may be her most accomplished and serious performances since "Crash," Bullock carries the film both through both moments of terror and temporary reprieve, while the effortless lightness of the beautiful camera angles and visual architecture of the film belies its meticulous construction.
If any criticism can be made, it is that "Gravity" comes tantalizingly close to realism only to have this realism undercut by a few logical inconsistencies. For the most part, though, "Gravity" is simultaneously a serious artistic achievement and a joy to watch, soaring above other 2013 films in its nuance and style. —Ola Topczewska
2. 12 Years A Slave
 
"12 Years a Slave" is an excruciating film to watch. It’s a worry-your-lip, dig-your-nails-into-your-arm, squirm-in-your-seat sort of film. Which is exactly as it should be. This is director Steve McQueen’s specialty: to pick a subject so painful, so dehumanizing, that it cannot be treated but with his own aesthetically stunning flavor of brutality. As in McQueen’s prior films, Michael Fassbender is the core of the film’s intensity; he manages to keep his performance as the cruel slave owner Epps realistic despite the character’s insanity, and thus represents perhaps the most troubling part of the film. "12 Years a Slave" lingers, long after Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) escapes his bondage and the theater lights come back on. This is exactly what McQueen wants—his subject deserves this brand of haunting imagery, and his skillful direction ensures it will not leave the minds of his viewers easily. —Grace E. Huckins
3. Star Trek Into Darkness
 
This summer, the phasers of "Star Trek" were definitely set to stun. For fans of the franchise’s 2009 reboot, "Star Trek Into Darkness" was a necessary nod to one of the baddest villains in the history of the series and a welcome departure from its predecessor’s light-hearted tone. "Into Darkness" initiates this tonal shift without delay; the movie opens with a terrorist attack in London and a threat to the life of a Starfleet officer minutes afterward. Instead of watching Kirk take another joyride on the Enterprise, viewers now get to watch him make ethically complicated decisions, the results of which have profound implications for the other characters. Benedict Cumberbatch executes his portrayal of the ruthless Khan with chilling intensity, which helps to drive the film into a much more sophisticated (and darker) domain. —Charlotte D. Smith
3. Pacific Rim
Trailers for "Pacific Rim" promised a "Transformers"-like tale of mechanical warfare, so one could be forgiven for assuming the film would serve up action at the expense of relatability. Propelled by its irresistible sense of fun and lighthearted take on the action genre, however, "Pacific Rim" became one of the most surprising hits of the summer, proving these preconceptions wrong.
In this over-the-top yet consistently enjoyable film, humanity must fight for its existence against monsters called kaijus. To contain the assault, a pan-Pacific government resurrects the "Jaeger" program: gigantic robots, controlled by two mentally linked pilots, who just may have the strength to send the monsters back to hell. Led by convincingly stoic actors Charlie Hunnam, Rinko Kikuchi, and Idris Elba, this film is pure joy from start to finish. Just sit back, relax, and enjoy director Guillermo del Toro’s ride. —Leanna B. Ehrlich
3. The Great Gatsby
An adaptation of a classic novel is never an easy undertaking, and Baz Luhrmann rose to the challenge with his film adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s "The Great Gatsby." With its CGI cityscapes of an earlier New York City, realistic sets that recall the Prohibition era, masterful camerawork, and purposefully anachronistic soundtrack combining 1920s-era groove with modern-day rap and R&B, the film is a sensory explosion. "The Great Gatsby"—framed as a memoir narrated from the point of view of the protagonist, Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire), as he sits in a sanitorium—quickly draws the audience into the world of East Egg and West Egg, enticed by the mysterious Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio).
The best scene in the film comes at the end, as Gatsby, coming to terms with his own illusions, shatters both physically and emotionally when a bullet tears through his chest. The close-up shot of DiCaprio’s anguish is piercing—a sudden crash into the pool, capping the film with a bone-chilling note. In addition to the fantastic directing and camerawork, the supporting cast is equally captivating, and Luhrmann does a fantastic job exploring the depths of each character’s psyche. —Soyoung Kim
6. Fruitvale Station
In 2009, when 22-year-old Oscar Grant lost his life early on New Year’s Day at the hands of a Bay Area Rapid Transit Police officer, then-film student Ryan Coogler knew he had to respond. His first feature film, "Fruitvale Station," which was released this summer after stealing the show at Sundance, is an intimate chronicle of the last 24 hours of Grant’s life, an 85-minute portrait of a man who, despite dabbling in drug dealing and cheating on his girlfriend, was nonetheless loved by his struggling family. There’s little suspense—a real cell phone video of the tragedy kicks off the film—but no lack of power; the fictionalized Grant may be overly sympathetic, but embodied by rising star Michael B. Jordan, the young man is perfectly believable and heartbreakingly human. —Tree A. Palmedo
7. Blue Jasmine
A modern reimagining of the Tennessee Williams play "A Streetcar Named Desire," Woody Allen’s "Blue Jasmine" features an ensemble cast that highlights Cate Blanchett in one of the strongest performances of the year. Blanchett channels her previous stage experience as Blanche DuBois in the Brooklyn Academy of Music’s 2009 production of "Streetcar" as she plays Jeannette Francis, a formerly wealthy New York socialite who moves to San Francisco to rebuild her life with her sister. Jeannette struggles to reconcile her sister Ginger’s (Sally Hawkins) blue-collar existence with the once glamorous lifestyle she led alongside her husband Hal (Alec Baldwin), a cunning Wall Street businessman. Through Blanchett’s compelling depiction of Jasmine’s neurosis, Allen forges into new territory, exploring issues of contemporary class conflict in a post-recession society. —Alan R. Xie
8. Warm Bodies
 
"Warm Bodies" seemed like just another "Twilight": an absurd romance combined with a classic horror monster. However, the film manages to transform the traditional Romeo-and-Juliet storyline into a genuinely humorous "zomcom" (zombie romantic comedy). Instead of falling flat—the film’s plotline is certainly the corniest of the year—the zombie R’s self-deprecating internal monologue is, in fact, hilarious and helps the movie to embrace its ridiculous premise. It’s a hipster dream come true: an eclectic soundtrack, an absurd storyline with just enough irony, and self-aware zombies struggling with internal guilt. "Warm Bodies" doesn’t just ride the zombie wave of 2013—it gives the zombie movement a heart. —Devony B. Schmidt
8. The Spectacular Now
The story of "The Spectacular Now" is nothing new: popular boy falls for unpopular girl. It’s a plot that has either entertained or underwhelmed audiences for ages. But where this adaptation of Tim Tharp’s young adult novel succeeds is in the electric chemistry between the two leads, a result of their brilliant acting. Miles Teller plays hard-partying high school senior Sutter Keely with enough genuine charm and warmth that you can’t help but root for him. Shailene Woodley, a fantastically gifted actress (see: "The Descendants"), stars as the unconventionally attractive geek Aimee Finicky (she wears her hair in a ponytail! She doesn’t wear make-up! She reads!) The film also defies genre conventions by having the two deal with issues of drugs, sex, alcohol, and family without coming off as melodramatic or, worse, preachy. "The Spectacular Now" is poignant and effortlessly funny—a rare, relatable story of young love. —Aaron H. Aceves
8. Spring Breakers
It’s not at all surprising that Vanessa Hudgens and Selena Gomez would star in a raucous vacation comedy. It’s similarly unsurprising that Harmony Korine would make a film touching on drug use, murder, and alienation. What’s surprising is that "Spring Breakers" is both of those films. What’s shocking is that it’s one of the best films of 2013.
Korine’s earlier films were sustained experiments in discomfort; "Spring Breakers," though no less concerned with the seedier side of human life, is an unabashedly enjoyable picture. One can’t help but relish James Franco’s bizarre turn as lowlife Alien, the dazzlingly hazy cinematography, or the fact that this is the only American film in recent memory that pairs violent robbery with Britney Spears’s "Everytime." —Petey E. Menz

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Crimson Arts board discusses its favorite records of the year.
1. "Yeezus," Kanye West
Do you remember your first love? It was easy, it came naturally, and it didn’t take much thought. You fell into it—and most likely, you fell out of it. The loves that last, the ones that shape us, are the ones that challenge us. They force us to look hard at ourselves, to compromise, and to grow. "Yeezus" is just that sort of love—the type that refuses to debase itself with pandering attempts at showmanship or shiny packaging. Its every surface is jagged and honed to a glittering edge, an ostentatious provocation to any listener willing to take it on, and beyond that wholly unwelcoming approach lies an album dripping with lethal intent. West’s anguish of the "808s and Heartbreak" era and the grandeur of his "My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy" days are hardened and wielded here as sonic weapons against the complacent listeners of today. "Yeezus" is a dare, and for the bold, it is one so worth taking.—Alexander Tang
2. "The Bones of What You Believe," Chvrches
There are two ways to make big music. You can use dissonance and attitude (à la Sleigh Bells), or you can do the complete opposite. One might even call Chvrches’ instrumentation minimalist—"Bones" revolves around synthesizers, drum machine, and Lauren Mayberry’s vocals. But the sound universe occupied by the album seems to shatter every imaginable boundary—a glittering, cosmic world that occasionally sounds like Grimes, could be compared to Purity Ring, but ultimately finds its roots in traditional pop music. In fact, the album’s most memorable moment is also its poppiest—Mayberry quietly insists on "Tether," "I feel incapable of seeing the end / I feel incapable of saying it’s over," before her delicate a cappella suddenly gives way to a stunning deluge of synthesizers.—Se-Ho B. Kim
3. "Pure Heroine," Lorde
 
As an American, I understand the harsh reality of never being able to be royal, but that’s not the only reason why I love Lorde. She is not just a one-hit wonder; Lorde’s debut "Pure Heroine" is the album that just keeps on givin’. Her voice is angelic and chilling all at the same time: the hypnotic beat against the backdrop of her soulful hymns feel like a rallying cry in "Glory and Gore" as she challenges, "You could try and take us / But we’re the gladiators." From her disdain for the vacuousness of modern pop in "Team" ("I’m kind of over gettin’ told to throw my hands up in the air / So there") to her soft and smoky runs in "Tennis Court," Lorde is only that much more impressive considering that she’s only 17. She is wise beyond her years, with an album that is so self-aware and sultry that it knocks on the doors of pop powerhouses like Ellie Goulding while teaching a good lesson to pop stars who grind for dollars like Miley Cyrus. Lorde is making inspired pop music that can hit the club and your iPod while making you think twice about how we treat each other and—most importantly—ourselves.  —Lauren A. Rubin
4. "Random Access Memories," Daft Punk
Eight years after "Human After All," Daft Punk exploded back onto the dance music scene, though not in the way die-hard fans might have expected. "Random Access Memories" uncovered the smooth, seductive underbelly of the digitally inclined duo, proving that electronic music can have little to do with bleeps and bloops and everything to do with emotion and nostalgia. Between the joyful opener "Give Life Back To Music" and "Contact," a concluding track that begins thoughtful and builds to an anthem so intense it almost overwhelms, the French pair meditates on everything from the roots of electronica to the wistful thirst for alone time with someone who’s already taken. And, of course, they deliver the most exhilarated track of the summer in "Get Lucky." —Natalie T. Chang
5. "Modern Vampires of the City," Vampire Weekend
The polo-clad pop quartet finally got real. That’s not to say Vampire Weekend have gotten boring—they’re still churning out grade-A pop songs and sprinkling their lyrics with references to everything from the Old Testament to OutKast."But "Modern Vampires" sees the band opening up emotionally in a way they never have. On "Step," Ezra Koenig struggles to separate growing up from getting old; on "Ya Hey," he has a conversation with God; and on "Finger Back" he spits words so rapid-fire you might not even notice that he’s talking about sectarian violence. "Modern Vampires" tackles the Big Questions of the musicians’ generation—namely, how to find meaning in a youth-obsessed society drowning in nostalgia. Yet, as we’ve come to expect from a VW album, it’s also impossible to take off repeat. Rest assured, the sweater’s still on—but now the gloves are off. —Matthew J. Watson
6. "Overgrown," James Blake
 
James Blake’s "Overgrown" isn’t a masterpiece, unlike his soulfully devastating self-titled debut of 2011. That being said, it’s still a fantastic album—one of which the best moments are also its most bizarre. "Voyeur" is a good example: the idea of Blake repeating "And her mind was on me" over the looped sound of a cowbell and synths reminiscent of air-raid sirens for three minutes may seem unappealing, but it turns out to be pure chaotic magic. As someone who thinks it would be a crime against humanity if Blake never produces a hip-hop album, I applaud him for letting RZA spit on "Take A Fall For Me," even if the outcome is less than wu-tacular. Finally, to make "Overgrown" even better, replace the original "Life Round Here" in your iTunes Library with Chance the Rapper’s version. You won’t regret it. —Will Holub-Moorman
7. "AM," Arctic Monkeys
"AM" is a rock album, and an efficient one. The dark, paranoid release, the fifth by the Sheffield group, fuses decades of rock history—from the Black Sabbath-versus-Black Keys doom of opener "Do I Wanna Know?" to the piano stomp of "Snap Out Of It," the psychedelics of "Why’d You Only Call Me When You’re High?" to the balladry of "No.1 Party Anthem." Frontman Alex Turner’s brooding lyricism puts desire and desperation at the bitter heart of the album, but the Monkeys’ studied intensity never loses a Britpop spunk. Turner’s wordplay is sharp, with tongue-twisters like "Tracy Island, time-traveling diamond" and a Scorsese pun on "Knee Socks." In the era of the declining rock and roll band, "AM" is a rock record both youthful and traditional. —Austin Siegemund-Broka
8. "The 20/20 Experience," Justin Timberlake
 
First off, let’s all just wipe "The 20/20 Experience—2 of 2" from our memories. JT’s second album of 2013 turned out to be a lazy collection of tired, monotonous dance tunes, but that does not take anything away from his true triumph this year. On "The 20/20 Experience," Timberlake gracefully balances artistry with accessibility—from the lush, Marvin Gaye-indebted champagne anthem "Suit & Tie" to the galloping bongos and crisp horns of "Let the Groove Get In." The album retains plenty of the vintage JT sound, and there’s also a bevy of old-school R&B touches that complement Timberlake’s ever-able falsetto. Here’s hoping a follow-up—and a real one, please—comes some time before 2020. —Tree A. Palmedo
9. "Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeroes," Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeroes
 
Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros are back—with neo-hippie vibes radiating off their brows and bare toes tapping in time to chanted group choruses—and they’re ready to teach us all to love again. Critics largely panned the band’s self-titled album comparing their distinctly kitschy, clapping, love-is-all-around anthems unfavorably to classroom sing-a-longs. However, it is difficult to imagine anyone leading a group of six-years-olds in a rousing rendition of "Let’s Get High." The album is engineered to feel old and jangly—Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros seem dedicated to the premise that if a song sounds dusty enough, it will somehow become wise. It’s all in good (if oddly condescending) fun. —Sorrel L. Nielsen
10. "The Electric Lady," Janelle Monáe 
Janelle Monáe has returned at long last. Her second full-length album "The Electric Lady" is the follow-up to her critically acclaimed "The ArchAndroid" (2010), both of which elaborate the slightly Afro-futuristic and always dystopian saga inaugurated by her 2007 debut EP "Metropolis: The Chase Suite." Whereas Monáe’s exceedingly brilliant previous efforts explored genres from punk rock to hip-hop, electro-pop to folk, and jazz to classical (and everywhere in between), "The Electric Lady" stands apart as an extended exercise in rhythm and blues, soul, funk, and all their variations. Monáe’s kaleidoscopic vision recasts classic African-American popular music, helped by icons Prince and Erykah Badu and R&B newcomers Miguel, Solange, and Esperanza Spalding. "The Electric Lady" is Monáe’s most stylistically cohesive work yet, as beautiful and thrilling as it is ambitious. —Nicholas T. Rinehart

With this issue, the first Crimson Arts Year in Review, we hope to begin a successful tradition of putting students’ perspectives on arts and entertainment in the same room with those of our staff. The issue is a new project, but it is also the culmination of a year of bringing Crimson Arts back into alignment with The Crimson’s oldest values.
 
“I will not philosophize, I will be read”—so wrote the Crimson staff in the paper’s first ever editorial. That was published 131 years before the first edition of Crimson Arts was, but it’s a maxim we’ve tried to keep in mind. It’s easy for arts criticism to be dense, pretentious, or pseudo-intellectual; music, movies, books, and theater all inspire strong feelings, and all too often those feelings inspire florid prose, overblown metaphors, or hopelessly obscure references. Crimson Arts has been guilty of all of those things.
 
There’s nothing wrong with The Crimson’s arts journalism setting a high standard of writing and analysis, though. The problem is when that complexity is used to confuse, not clarify; to obscure conclusions (or a lack thereof), not to present them at their engaging fullest. We have remained committed this year to journalism and criticism that make the arts accessible and exciting. “The role of the critic is to mediate intelligently and stylishly between a work and its audience,” Daniel Mendelsohn wrote in The New Yorker in 2012. Well said, Danny, but there’s also the part that involves punny headlines.
That ethic has shaped our coverage choices as well as our writing, with one goal: to connect with our readership. It seems obvious, but it’s a goal that has sometimes been neglected in the past. With the Year in Review issue, we’ve made our most direct effort yet to engage with our readers, and we can’t wait to see how it goes over.

There comes a time in everyone’s life when they begin to discuss punk/glam-rock/emo band AFI in earnest. AFI (A Fire Inside) began in 1991 and have been making music for over 20 years. It only makes sense that their aesthetic has changed and evolved to where it is on their 2013 album, “Burials.” However, once we accept as the premise for our discussion that AFI is the best band that has ever been formed or recorded music—and will continue to be so until our globe is a blasted ice hunk hurling randomly through space—we can begin to investigate the highs and lows of the group’s career. We will come to find that the AFI of their first album, “Answer That and Stay Fashionable,” would be compelled to kick the asses of the AFI on “Burials.” Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the evidence: 
 
1. “Highschool Football Hero” v. “No Resurrection” 
“I wanna be a highschool football hero…. I wanna / try to drink my weight in beer-o.” v. “Why must you crush our glow? / Don't you know that heaven is slow? / Don't remake our heaven.” 
Nothing like old punks moaning about the “slowness” of “heaven” to get some smashed footballers riled up. 
 
2. “Cereal Wars” v. “Wild”
“Get up early in the morning, going to the store. / Post, Kellogg’s, General Mills? / It's the cereal war.” v. “True love won’t be remembered.”
So what if your love is forgotten? There are more important dramas being staged on aisle five. 
 
3. “I Want A Mohawk (But mom won’t let me get one)” v. “17 Crimes”
“I may be 10 years old but I still know what's up…. I may be in fourth grade, but I know what's going on.” v. “Let’s love like 17. / I’m in love with poisoning.”
In which a 10-year-old punk beats up a simpering 17-year-old who reads poetry and doesn’t know how to skate.
 
4. “Two of a Kind” v. “The Face Beneath the Waves” 
“Hangin' out and lingerin' around, cause you know where / I'll be found, and I don't know how you do it.”  v. “I will return to you / I will return again / I am part of you.”
If 20-year-old Davey Havok ran across “Burials”-era Davey in an alley, sneaking around and muttering these lyrics, he would punch him in the face. And then maybe take him out for vegan fries.
 
AFI for ever and ever. And ever.
—Sorrel L. Nielsen is the outgoing Music executive.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A common lament in our age of partisan intransigence is that issues of national import are left unaddressed because of the fickle political winds prevailing on the Potomac. Amid the aftermath of the government shutdown and the uproar over HealthCare.gov, however, progress appears possible on an issue that appeared dead: immigration reform. With establishment Republicans and their traditional allies behind the bill passed by the Senate in June with a bipartisan majority of 68-32 and President Obama calling on the House to act, our dysfunctional political system has managed to encourage some optimism. Yet despite the strong economic and moral arguments in favor of immigration reform, opposition from the ever-disruptive Tea Party and—more disturbingly—grassroots organizations with unsavory ties to a leader whose views have been described as white supremacist is threatening to empower a vocal minority and endanger a course of action clearly in the national interest.
The moral imperative for reform is clear. With over 11 million undocumented immigrants providing crucial labor to the American economy, particularly in agriculture, our society’s pursuit of a policy of family-disrupting deportations simply to enforce widely ignored, ill-thought-through laws is unconscionable. The status quo of immigration enforcement too often involves arresting the working parents of U.S. citizens and holding them for extended periods in horridly run private detention facilities before permanently separating them from their families. The Applied Research Center has found that almost 15,000 children are currently at risk of having their parents deported within five years; meanwhile, investigations by media organizations like the New York Times and PBS’s Frontline have found that solitary confinement and abusive treatment are both far too common in the prisons used to house those suspected of living in the country illegally. In short, enforcement measures disrupt life for an already marginalized group for little discernible gain. While the proposed immigration reform is not perfect in improving enforcement, it is certainly an improvement from the status quo.
Buttressing this moral case for reform is the economic one. As noted, immigrants are crucial to the agricultural industry, and the evidence from states that both rely on agriculture and have passed harsh immigration laws is clear. As economist Benjamin Powell noted, the year Georgia’s legislation came into effect, “farmers were about 40 percent short of the number of workers they needed to harvest [their] crop,” resulting in $140 million lost. These numbers effectively undermine two common and related arguments in favor of immigration crackdowns: that immigrants occupy jobs that Americans would otherwise hold and that they simply take from social programs without providing any economic boost. Immigrants are in fact doing work that is otherwise undone and in doing so providing a crucial economic service.
These practical and moral implications of the status quo have created a consensus in favor of immigration reform. The bill that the Senate passed in June is quite moderate, including a 13-year pathway to citizenship, tens of billions allocated to border security, and a reduction in the deficit, and has the support of business groups, who recently launched a major lobbying offensive in its favor, and establishment Republicans like Senator John McCain. Evangelical Christians have also been supportive of efforts to make the immigration system more humane, while on the libertarian front, Harvard Professor Jeffrey A. Miron has given the Senate bill his blessing, despite serious reservations over its enforcement measures.
Two forces, then, are working to hold up reform. Tea Party figures like Ted Cruz have marshaled typical arguments against reform, including criticism of its already stringent border security measures and repetition of the idea that amnesty would incentivize a new flood of undocumented migration—as if demand for labor weren’t incentive enough. Fortunately, stringent anti-reform sentiment is relatively small in the House—only 30 lawmakers are sure to vote no on any proposal.
More troubling, however, is the equally small but well organized group of grassroots organizations that spearheaded resistance to reform this summer. As Molly Ball noted in The Atlantic noted in August, these organizations—the largest of which are NumbersUSA, the Center for Immigration Studies, and the Federation for American Immigration Reform—are all tied to John Tanton, a figure who has been appropriately described as a white supremacist with a knack for making his causes mainstream. NumbersUSA, the biggest group, have been diligent in denying any racist motives, and the organization counts members of Congress among their supporters. But the type of rhetoric that gets bandied about by Tanton-tied groups at their rallies is revealing; at one, a Tea Party figure praised Americans’ “great DNA” and “breeding.”
The influence of NumbersUSA and its more extreme relatives is clearly just one facet of the opposition to immigration reform, but it accentuates the inanity of the debate as a whole. On one side is a compelling case uniting diverse interests around a moderate bill that significantly improves the U.S. immigration system. On the other is a small group of lawmakers deriving their entire external support from groups whose origins and rhetoric should give their supporters serious misgivings. Given the immense gains to be had from immigration reform, we’re in trouble if we cannot overcome the current level of opposition and pass meaningful legislation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In light of rising backlash against affirmative action and the recent Supreme Court decision on the matter, it is becoming clear that discourse on inequality in America is in a poor state. A program aimed at equalizing opportunity is too frequently misconstrued as unfair advantage or “reverse racism.”
I have had several friends tell me with no qualms that they thought it was “unfair” that “more qualified” members of (insert their own demographic) were “disadvantaged” by affirmative action policies that benefit “less qualified” women of color. Arguments against affirmative action range from “It hurts minorities because they receive a boost and are unable to keep up with the academic rigor” to, “It hurts minorities because they will be perceived as less qualified in the job market” to “Isn’t racism over?” (The last probably being closest to the real argument at hand, which is “This policy hurts me”).
First off, let’s be clear about one thing: The reason affirmative action even exists is because of a past that has obstructed the access of just about everyone but wealthy, white men to education opportunity. Affirmative action does not hurt non-beneficiaries. It is an attempt, however incomplete, to rectify pre-established power imbalances in society. Past systems of inequality do not just disappear because our laws no longer explicitly mandate them. Stereotypes of women and minorities already exist and continue to be perpetuated by popular media, dating etiquette, seemingly harmless jokes, and probably in every single New York Times piece on hookup culture (is it just me or are those published every other week?). To assume that race or affirmative action is the defining characteristic of one’s admission is naïve and arrogant.
Affirmative action is a policy that has opened up doors for women, working class men, and a variety of ethnic and racial minorities. The fact that most affirmative action debates generally focus on black-and-white arguments (literally and figuratively) speaks volumes about where we stand as a society in terms of racial progress. Even with regard to arguments for class-based affirmative action, no one argues that only women of a certain socio-economic status face obstacles to overcoming social barriers. The greatest philosophers, thinkers, inventors, and political leaders outlined by our selective history are for the most part white men, and this is not by chance or the innate characteristics of a demographic just as diverse as any other. Affirmative action is by no means a comprehensive solution to addressing racial or gender inequality, but it is an important element not because it gives “unfair” advantage to one demographic but because it takes away “unfair” advantage from another.
We have expanded our definition of what it means to be worthy of an education in America, but the metrics we use for measuring and understanding this have not adapted accordingly. People often have a terrible tendency of putting their own experiences and emotions at the center of all truth and standards of fairness. For this reason, many will continue to consider themselves disadvantaged by affirmative action or view it as an unfair policy. We view gender and racial inequality as distinct social problems that have no bearing on what we hold as a sacred and unbiased educational meritocracy.
Despite the weight of evidence showing that when all qualifications are the same, minorities and women are less likely to receive job offers due to stereotypes (often unconscious), we continue to dismiss inescapable subjective elements involved in achieving success. There are still concentrations of black Americans in poor neighborhoods due to past segregation policies, our education system is still tied to socioeconomic status, old money networks still allow historically favored demographics access to internships, job opportunities, and cultural awareness that enhances scholastic aptitude. It is easy for some to hear of affirmative action and feel like a victim. It is not easy to see how lack of access to nutritional food affects productive capacity or how struggling to pay the bills affects mental health, and it is not easy to see how preconceived notions of race and gender inhibit one’s abilities to succeed. Arguments for and against affirmative action would be better off considering these realities rather than continuing to focus on tired and misguided rhetoric about fairness.
There is nothing wrong with being "privileged," especially since we cannot control the circumstances we are born into. The problem is failing to recognize our privilege and abusing or denying that privilege to hold others back.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The year 2013 at Harvard might well be remembered as the year of tomato basil ravioli. Sam B. Clark ’15 and Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15, running on a simple but effective platform of more tomato basil ravioli soup and thicker toilet paper, eked out a victory in the Undergraduate Council presidential election. This alone is an unprecedented feat for a “joke” ticket. Their win and somewhat predictable subsequent resignation represents a clear vote of no confidence from the Harvard student body to the UC, an organization that has recently sought “relevance” to students. It is a powerful wakeup call, a signal that the UC must reconsider the way business is done if it wants to remain relevant in student life.
A root cause of student discontent is the perceived inefficacy of the UC. As highlighted in the recent UC presidential debate, candidates year after year promised to improve engagement between the Council and the student body but year after year have provided few tangible results toward these ends. As Mayopoulos said in the debate, such platitudes are mere “empty words.” Clark also questioned the effectiveness of simply “being firm” and “having more meetings” with administrators, an apparently prevalent mentality in the UC. This modus operandi lacks transparency and concrete progress that the student body can see, creating unfavorable impressions of the UC.
The Clark-Mayopoulos ticket significantly diverged from this approach. Besides their obvious humor, what distinguished Clark and Mayopoulos was their straightforward platform and their focus on engaging students. Their lack of UC experience paradoxically seemed to serve as a benefit, as people saw them not as detached, aspiring politicians, but rather as relatable peers. Instead of promising an extensive slate of vaguely achievable promises, Clark and Mayopoulos promoted small but tangible (both literally and figuratively) changes to soup options and toilet paper. These practical suggestions for campus life were widely recognized and supported among the student body. Students expressed excitement after Harvard University Dining Services, supposedly coincidentally, announced last week the introduction of weekly tomato basil ravioli soup.
Certainly, other factors contributed to the exceptional election result. Due to an error by the UC Election Commission, this year’s election was decided by a plurality voting systems rather than the ranking system that is normally used. But regardless of the electoral system in place, that Clark-Mayopoulos garnered more votes than any other ticket speaks volumes to students’ perceptions of the UC.
In the end, Clark-Mayopoulos’s success usefully highlighted problems with the UC at little real cost. Because the pair plans to resign, the UC will elect their replacements internally. Last week, we endorsed C.C. Gong ’15 and Sietse K. Goffard ’15, the only ticket that seems fit for the job. The close second-place ticket will most likely take office in the end. But the new administration will come to power amid a wave of student dissatisfaction. They campaigned on a slogan of “Go Forward”—now, they must go forward in a significant, new way, or they risk dragging the UC into permanent irrelevance.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Usually when I write these things, I don’t want to hear any noise. That’s mainly because I’m very into myself. So it’s nice to only hear my own voice as I write.
But this time around, I really, really didn’t want to hear anything. I had just returned from a long weekend at The Game and had to write that night. For the past few days, I had been around people all the time, shouted with them, and laughed with them. I also had a bit of headache after drinking a lot of “totally non-alcoholic drinks.” Like, I had a lot of “totally non-alcoholic drinks.” And beer.
At first it was alright. The room was completely quiet besides the slight ticking of a clock. I opened up my laptop and started typing. But then suddenly and subtly, the gentle notes of a classical piano began to glide around the room, dampened by the wall to my left. My gut reaction:
“Damnit, Harvard.”
I feel like everyone here is a maestro—and the rest of us make up a silent minority, since we can’t make any nice sounds. Still, the piano was soothing. And when it stopped, I made sure to give the kid a clap as he left the adjacent room, alone.
Nothing says “you’re back” like Beethoven. Hearing the notes felt like a transition—from thousands cheering on big men with a ball, to just me overhearing a student next door putting fingers to keys. I went from a type of “state school” feeling, back to the same old, really old, prestigious, liberal, artsy, liberal artsy Harvard. You’ll see the same contrast in any national broadcast of The Game or coverage of Harvard men’s basketball in the NCAA tournament, as sports commentators make jokes about Harvard’s athletics in relation to its academics. In effect, being a Harvard sports fan seems a little quirky or odd because of this contrast.
But there is something I realized in that room, after the piano subsided and my thoughts were alone. There isn’t really a reason for any contrast or quirkiness in Harvard sports and academics—at least, not in ways that should affect our ability to be “real” fans.
Since the beginning of sports, or at least since High School Musical 2 hit theaters, athleticism has been seen as against academics. You’ve got the dumb, big jocks and the smart, scrawny nerds. Despite many examples to the contrary, it still seems obviously true to so many. And that’s because it is.
Athletics is anti-academic in that it literally takes away time that could be spent studying. But that’s not really unique. A lot of things take time, like playing classical music in a practice room or writing for The Crimson, or writing for The Crimson about listening to classical music while listening to classical music coming from someone practicing in the other room. So why do sports, comparatively, get a bad rap? It’s hard to tell. Depending on involvement, these activities can take up the same amount of time. They all reward hard work. For music and athletics, there is proof that doing both can help you think. And while journalism does cross paths with academic subjects, it rarely does so in a meaningful way. For example, read this article. So sports don’t really seem all that bad
Still, discussion in the administration on issues like recruiting suggest that sports are seen as incompatible with our University’s prestigious academics, especially when compared to larger state schools where fandom is more popular. All year, it seems like Harvard tries really, really hard to let you know you are not at a big state school. For instance, it takes $60,000 of money away from your family every semester. It emphasizes “concentrations,” suggesting that you may have problems concentrating on your “social studies” homework. And it provides free snacks to students at night. Sure, it’s hard to tell sometimes whether you are going to a small, expensive private middle school or a small, expensive liberal arts college, but you sure as hell know you’re not going to a big school that probably has a great football team.
But these differences should have no bearing on how we choose to root for our teams. The rarity of Harvard’s en masse fandom could partly be a result of students’ heavy workload. But I also think part of it is because of this false contrast between academic and athletic culture. And that’s unfortunate, because when I rolled out of bed—which was the hard, dirty floor of a Yale dorm room—after a few hours of sleep and showed up to a huge tailgate before we slaughtered our rivals in the biggest game in one of the most iconic sports in our country, I didn’t feel like a quirky type of fan, rooting for an Ivy league school’s best shot at athletics. I just felt like a college kid rooting on his team. That shouldn’t change just because I may expect to hear Beethoven’s Fifth on returning to campus.
The talents each student brings to Harvard, whether athletic, academic, musical, lyrical, or otherwise, are part of a coexistence, not separate quirks. And until Harvard fans and those outside the Harvard community see that, the great communal bonding and plain fun of The Game may always be just that—part of one game.
Oh and, by the way, Yale sucks.

Harvard Square is gearing up to usher in the holiday season with a unique take on the Black Friday tradition. The Harvard Square Business Association is planning to use the days following Thanksgiving to promote local businesses and authors, as well as to benefit charitable causes.
The day after Thanksgiving, the Square will celebrate “Plaid Friday”—a national movement encouraging customers to shop locally, rather than participating in “big box” Black Friday, according to Cambridge Local First. With locally owned, independent businesses accounting for 75 percent of Square storefronts, the Harvard Square Business Association began promoting Plaid Friday several years ago, according to HSBA Executive Director Denise A. Jillson.
 
The Association’s website features 23 Square businesses planning to offer in-store discounts on Friday, but the list is not exhaustive.
For some stores, this year’s holiday shopping also offers an opportunity to promote charitable organizations. Black Ink, at 5 Brattle St., intends to donate 10 percent of its sales on Friday to the United Nations Food Programme, aiding in its efforts to bring relief to survivors in the typhoon-stricken Philippines. Susan L. Corcoran, the store’s owner, wrote in an email to The Crimson that last year, Black Ink donated a portion of its Plaid Friday sales to those affected by Hurricane Sandy.
“This year, the typhoon in the Philippines struck those who were already in need, so it was easy to see that was where our donation would go in 2013,” she wrote. “Just a drop in the bucket, but I’m glad to see even more good coming from the day that we begin to shop in celebration of our families and friends.”
Following Black Friday, the Harvard Book Store plans to participate in “Small Business Saturday” by promoting the Indies First movement, created by author Sherman Alexie, in which local writers will visit independent bookshops to act as booksellers for the day. The list of expected attendees at the Harvard Book Store includes University professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr., History and African and African American Studies professor Walter Johnson, folklore and mythology professor Maria Tatar, and Harvard Law School professor Randall L. Kennedy.
 
“We have 19 authors coming to us on Saturday who will be here at staggered periods of the day,” store manager Mark Lamphier said. “We also asked each of them to come up with a list of books they want to evangelize for, so they are all talking about books they love, as well as their own books.”
 
Although previous Black Fridays in Harvard Square have been characterized as “low-key” or as yielding “mixed results”, recent years have witnessed an upswing in the day’s turnout that storeowners said they expect to continue.
 
“We were in the same swamp of an economy as everybody else starting in the fall of 2008,” Lamphier said. “It’s definitely gotten better the last couple of years, and Black Friday is actually somewhat a bigger deal for us now than it used to be.”
 
Yet brick and mortar shops still face the challenge of competing with the Internet to attract in-store crowds. Jillson said that the amount of online holiday shopping has grown in recent years, but she said she believes that visiting the Square is worth bundling up and braving the cold.
 
“In order to really experience the spirit of the season and enjoy all the things that come with it—from the nip in the air to the hot chocolate to the decorations—you need to leave your laptop at home and come out and enjoy it,” Jillson said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In two separate incidents over the past month, two Harvard undergraduates were arrested and charged with assault and battery on a Harvard University Police Department officer, among other charges.
The most recent incident occurred early on Sunday, Nov. 10, when Benjamin Y. Zhou '15 was arrested in the stairwell of Winthrop B entryway and charged with assault and battery on an officer, disorderly conduct, and resisting arrest. The other incident took place just before midnight on Saturday, Oct. 26, when Jack Z. Li '17 was arrested outside of Currier House during the annual Heaven and Hell Halloween party for the same three charges as well as the charge of assault with a dangerous weapon, according to their case dockets.
HUPD—which has “primary jurisdiction” over nearly all crimes occurring on Harvard’s campus, according to its website—rarely arrests Harvard students. Among the seven total arrests made by HUPD in the past 60 days, those of Zhou and Li were the only ones of Harvard students, according to HUPD’s unofficial public logs. HUPD has made 26 total arrests year-to-date, according to spokesperson Steven G. Catalano.
According to Zhou’s case docket, he was arraigned for the three charges on Nov. 12 and has a pre-trial hearing scheduled for Dec. 6. Zhou, 20, declined repeated requests for comment on this story.
According to the police report submitted by HUPD Officer Michael Rea, Rea and his partner Officer Jason Flaherty encountered Zhou while responding to a noise complaint at Winthrop at about 2 a.m. Rea’s report states that after Zhou refused to cooperate with several of the officers’ requests, Zhou assaulted the officers while attempting to flee. It eventually took the assistance of another officer to subdue Zhou and transport him to HUPD’s headquarters, according to Rea’s report. In the process, Zhou’s chin was lacerated and his elbow abraded, according to a separate report filed by Sergeant Scott A. Simas.
Like Zhou, Li, 19, declined multiple requests for comment on this story. According to Li’s case docket, he was arraigned on Oct. 28, and his pretrial hearing is set for Dec. 17.
According to a police report submitted by HUPD Officer Wilmon Chipman, Chipman ordered Li to step out of the line outside the entrance of the Heaven and Hell party while responding to a complaint from a Securitas officer about Li’s behavior. Chipman’s report said Chipman smelled alcohol on Li’s breath. After Li refused to cooperate with several of Chipman’s instructions, Chipman was joined by HUPD officer Charles Marren and then warned Li that he was in danger of being arrested, according to Chipman’s report. Li then assaulted Marren, striking him several times and attempting to grab Marren’s gun from its holster, according to a separate report filed by Marren.
According to Marren’s report, Li was subsequently subdued, handcuffed, and transported to the Cambridge Police Department headquarters. Once there, he was charged and given a verbal trespass warning for all Harvard-owned and -operated buildings and instructed not to return to campus, according to Marren’s report. Li left campus on Oct. 29, his roommate Nicholas A. Tarantino '17 said in a phone interview.
The minimum penalty for assault and battery of a public official in the state of Massachusetts is 90 days imprisonment or a $500 dollar fine. The maximum penalty for the same crime is two and a half years imprisonment or a $5,000 fine.
The Harvard College Student Handbook explicitly prohibits students from engaging in “all physical conflicts, confrontations, and altercations unless their own safety or that of another is at extreme jeopardy,” cautioning that disregarding this rule will usually result in forced withdrawal from the College.
HUPD and the Administrative Board, which oversees disciplinary proceedings for College students, declined to comment on this story.

Despite finishing in eleventh place in the Nov. 5 Cambridge City Council Election, Kenneth E. Reeves ’72 outspent every other candidate, according to the Massachusetts Office of Campaign & Political Finance.
Reeves has served on the Council since 1990 and, when first selected by the Council as mayor in 1992, he became the first openly gay African American man to serve as mayor of an American city.
But in the Nov. 5 election that garnered 17,743 valid ballots, Reeves received 934 votes on the first count, the 10th highest of the first count, and was defeated on the 15th count, eliminating him from the nine-person council.
 
This year, Reeves was the only incumbent—out of the seven running—to raise more than $25,000 this year and lose. All except two of the victorious nine—Nadeem A. Mazen and Craig A. Kelley—raised more than $25,000. 
Although Massachusetts finance laws limit personal donations to $500 per election cycle, Reeves raised about $55,000 during 2013 alone.
Reeves did not respond for repeated requests for comment throughout the campaign and after the election.
Reeves also outspent every other City Council candidate. This year, expenditures by his campaign amounted to more than $63,000. Reeves spent almost $10,000 more than he raised during 2013.
 
The funds from Reeves were almost evenly split between two consultants, Luis E. Cotto and JoAnna Di Tullio. Cotto received $500 per week to organize the office, volunteers, and paid phone bankers, he explained over email. Di Tullio led the social media side of the Reeves campaign and strove to build an online presence through email newsletters and networking sites.
 
“As Ken's traditional voter base aged, he wanted to connect with younger voters,” Di Tullio wrote in an email. “Through activating his social media channels, sending out a monthly eNewsletter to over 800 subscribers and utilizing other online communications, we reached out to the younger Cambridge voter demographic.”

A perennial issue faced by Harvard Hillel reemerged in anticipation of the November 11 visit of Avraham Burg, a prominent Israeli author, politician, and activist. Burg, whose trip was co-sponsored by the Harvard College Palestinian Solidarity Committee and a number of Hillel-affiliated organizations, was restricted from speaking at Hillel due to policies of Hillel International that prohibit college affiliates from partnering with organizations that hold views on Israel that it deems to be in conflict with its mission.
Now, in response to these issues, the Harvard Hillel Steering Committee plans to unveil new event co-sponsorship policies.
In the past, Hillel-affiliated organizations have encountered obstacles when attempting to co-sponsor events with the Harvard College Palestinian Solidarity Committee, as its platform advocates for the boycott of, divestment from, and sanctions against Israel—a campaign commonly known as BDS. Hillel International, the umbrella organization for Jewish life on college campuses, restricts affiliated college Hillels from hosting any organization promoting BDS.
For this month’s event, Harvard Hillel groups scheduled the co-sponsored talk to take place in the Quincy House Junior Common Room instead of at Hillel in deference to Hillel International’s policies, according to Harvard Hillel Undergraduate President David F. Sackstein ’14. 
“[It] was agreed upon in advance that this wouldn't occur at Hillel, in compliance with these organizations' interpretation of Harvard Hillel's policy,” he said.
The national policy is designed to affirm Hillel International’s support for “perspectives in support of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state,” according to the organization’s website. Despite the umbrella organization’s rule, members of Hillel-affiliated groups said they have been able to collaborate constructively on these sensitive issues with the PSC.
At Harvard, the Hillel International policy has come under significant criticism in recent years, as many students perceive the policy as a hindrance to constructive discourse on campus, said Sara Kantor ’14, former Hillel president and current Harvard Students for Israel co-president. Kantor is also a Crimson arts columnist.
Echoing this sentiment, Sandra Y.L. Korn ’14, who serves as a board member on three Hillel-affiliated groups, said she believes this policy runs contrary to the goals of all groups involved.
“I think the idea that pro-Palestinian voices are not allowed to speak at the Hillel is a naked attack on free speech,” said Korn, who is also a Crimson editorial columnist.“[The policies] don’t reflect what most students at Harvard believe.”
In efforts to address these concerns, the Hillel Steering Committee created the Co-sponsorship Advisory Committee last year, which was tasked with developing a new policy that “promotes free speech to the best of [its] ability,” Sackstein said.
These new guidelines, while attempting to promote more free speech and streamline event co-sponsorship in the future, will still comply with Hillel International’s guidelines, Sackstein said. 
“We can't as an organization appear to support BDS, but we're open to dialogue, we're open to free speech,” Sackstein said. “We honestly feel that if we can't have these important conversations here at Harvard, we can't have them anywhere.”
Although new policies have been in the works for the course of the past year, this is the first time Harvard Hillel leadership has spoken publicly about their plans due to the sensitivity of the policy. 
Despite many varying views on the issue, Sackstein said he believes that the new policy will be beneficial for all parties involved. 
“We think it's something that both sides—people who are more traditionally supportive of Israel and people who are really hoping to have somewhat more open conversations—could get on board with,” he said. “We’ve been slowly trying to move towards something that embodies the real needs and desires of the entire community.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: Nov. 27, 2013
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Sara Kantor ’14 is a Crimson editorial columnist. In fact, she is a Crimson arts columnist.

Aided by strong performances across event groups, the Harvard men’s swimming and diving team (3-0, 3-0 Ivy) defeated Columbia (2-2, 1-2) at Uris Pool on Friday night, extending its perfect record. However, despite what the final score of 170-130 suggests, the win did not come easily.
The Lions put up impressive times in several races to edge out the Crimson, whose main focus had been on the Texas Invitational two weeks away.
“[The meet] was actually tougher than we expected,” co-captain Chris Satterthwaite said. “We have been doing a lot of really good work in the pool and in the weight room getting ready for our championship in Texas. A lot of races came down to the finish, and Columbia out-touched us in a couple of those.”
Fierce competition between the two teams produced a plethora of close events. In the 400-yard medley relay, Harvard’s “A” team of freshmen Jack Manchester and Eric Ronda, along with sophomores Jacob Luna and Satterthwaite staged a big comeback in the anchor leg, winning with a new pool record of 3:20.41 and barely beating the Lions’ “A” team time of 3:20.45. Columbia returned the favor later with freshman Terry Li (1:39.68) edging out Crimson junior Zach Walters (1:39.96) in the very last seconds of the 200 freestyle.
“Before we knew it, at about the halfway mark, we were only up by six points,”
Satterthwaite said. “[The margin] was a lot closer than what we were comfortable with, so the coaches, [co-captain] Oliver [Lee,] and I rallied the guys together … we made a push going into the second half of the meet, and ended up coming out on top.”
The freshmen continued to mark their presence on the team. Manchester, a backstroke specialist, raced in four events and picked up three victories—the 400 IM relay, 100 backstroke (50.41), and 200 backstroke (1:47.93). Classmate Cliff Goertemiller, a distance freestyle swimmer, put his expertise on display by claiming both the 1000 (9:20.84) and 500 (4:33.68) freestyle races.
Diver Michael Mosca continued his dominance on the board, winning both the one-meter and three-meter events. Mosca is undefeated in both events through meets against Dartmouth, Cornell, and Columbia.
The competition had its own share of unsung heroes as well, those who did not clinch individual victories but added points to Harvard’s total nevertheless. Junior Mike Gaudiani competed in three long-distance individual events: the 500 free, the 1000-yard free, and the 400 individual medley. Gaudiani scored decisive points for Harvard, coming in fourth in the 500-yard freestyle and second in the 1000-yard freestyle.
“[Gaudiani’s races] were the three toughest individual races offered,” Satterthwaite said. “It was very impressive for him to pull off that triple.”
With the second-half Crimson surge, a 1-3-4-5 finish in the 500 freestyle led by Goertemiller coupled with Harvard teams finishing 1-3-4 in the 200 freestyle relay sealed the Crimson win. The victorious 200 freestyle relay team of junior Griffin Schumacher, senior Danny Crigler, Lee, and Satterthwaite topped off the meet in style, shattering another Uris Pool record.
The team credits the coaching staff—which included some substantial turnover from last year—for its early-season success. For the 2013-2014 campaign, Kevin Tyrrell has been promoted to head coach, while Samantha Pitter has joined the Crimson as an assistant after five seasons at MIT.
“[Tyrrell and Pitter] are doing a really great job,” Satterthwaite said. “They are putting some new energy into the team and getting us excited about the season. All that is very much appreciated.”
Harvard has its sight now set on the Texas Invitational, which will bring many of the nation’s top swimming and diving programs together at the University of Texas from Dec. 5th to 7th. And while it is several months away, the team ultimately hopes to use it to avenge its loss at the Ivy League Championships last spring.
“We look good,” Satterthwaite said. “Our guys are swimming faster at this point in the season than they were last year…we are pleased with how the season has been going thus far, but our main goal of the season is to win Ivies, and especially to beat Princeton at Ivies. To prepare for that, we are definitely eager to swim in some of the more challenging meets like [the Texas Invitational].”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While the focus coming into the 130th rendition of The Game may have been on the seniors’ final collegiate matchup, it was a sophomore who stole the show at the Yale Bowl. By the end of Saturday afternoon, running back Paul Stanton had tied the Harvard record for total touchdowns in The Game, leading the Crimson to a share of the Ivy League title.
Finishing a career day with 27 carries for 118 yards and four catches for 40 yards, Stanton was involved in every Harvard end zone trip. All four came in a first-half romp that saw the Crimson go up 28-0 before the break.
“I think this might have been my first time ever having four [touchdowns],” Stanton said. “Maybe when I was younger [playing touch or flag football] I had games like that, but I never thought I would have that in a college football game.”
The running back began Harvard’s offensive onslaught with a 25-yard touchdown dash on the first drive and continued the momentum with two receiving scores of 21 and 18 yards, his first touchdown catches of the season. Coming into the contest, the running back had not even caught a pass in the two most recent games.
“That’s something I’ve really tried to work on,” Stanton said. “I wanted to catch some more passes this year, and coach [Tim Murphy] set up some great screen plays this week [that] we hadn’t even used [before].”
With Stanton firing on all cylinders, gaining yardage became substantially easier for the rest of the Crimson offense.
“Having [Stanton], with the ability to catch and run with [the ball], is another thing that the defense has to prepare for,” said senior tight end Cameron Brate. “We love it. The more the defense has to worry about, the better for us and our offense.”
Capping off a 13-play, 72-yard drive that ate five-and-a-half minutes of the game clock, Stanton stretched the lead to 28 with his second rushing score of the day, this time stretching past the goal line on a two-yard carry.
Even with the victory secure, Murphy kept his starters in until the waning seconds of the fourth quarter.
Determined to make sure the Bulldogs wouldn’t make up the deficit, Stanton put an extra nail in Yale’s coffin with a two-yard run on fourth-and-one with two minutes left.
“We wanted to come out strong after last week, [when] we let [Penn] come back, so we thought it was a big deal to start off strong,” Stanton said.
By the end of the day, the 5’9”, 190 pound back—who had drawn interest from the likes of Cornell, Princeton, Columbia, and Brown before committing to Harvard two years ago—was recognized by yet another Ivy League coach.
“He’s a good back. He’s been a good back all year long,” said Yale coach Tony Reno during the postgame interview. “He accelerates well, he gets to the hole fast…has good feet. He runs very hard, so he’s a tough kid to tackle. We didn’t tackle him nearly as well as we needed to in the first half.”
Opponents had a tough time tackling Stanton all season long. The Kenner, La. native, who clocked a 4.40 second 40-yard dash time at Harvard’s prospect camp during the recruiting process, finished his stellar campaign with 936 yards on the ground and 17 total touchdowns.
Coming into the fall season, Stanton wasn’t slated to be the only player in the backfield—he and sophomore Zach Boden were expected to carry the load together.
The two split the duties against San Diego in the opening game of the year, with Stanton gaining 64 yards on six touches and Boden 14 yards on eight carries.
However, when Boden went down with a knee injury, Stanton made the most of the opportunity, tallying a rushing touchdown in every game except against Dartmouth.
His consistency freed up the rest of the Harvard offense, as Crimson quarterbacks Connor Hempel and Michael Pruneau combined for eight touchdowns and only one interception in the four games Stanton ran for over 100 yards.
“It’s been an awesome experience to get this opportunity,” Stanton said. “I felt like I was very lucky to get [it], and I wanted to take full advantage of it.”
Now with a league co-championship under his belt, Stanton looks to keep up the momentum going into the offseason.
“Right after Thanksgiving break, we’re going to get back into the weight room, and we’ll be going for the Ivy League title next year,” Stanton said. “Hopefully [it won’t be] shared, and we’ll be able to win it outright.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
They may be a year older, but the Harvard men’s water polo sophomores are up to the same shenanigans as last time around. They are still easy to spot walking around campus.
Just look for the guys with the tans.
SOGO, or “Sun’s Out, Guns Out,” is a club founded by the five California natives of the team’s 2016 class.
“It shows our dedication to the tan nation,” attacker Blake Lee said.
In addition to being a goofy and close-knit group of athletes, the sophomores have also transformed the Crimson water polo program, leading it to an 18-14 finish this season, including an 11-1 mark in CWPA Northern division play.
“The things we are doing haven’t been done here since ’02,” coach Ted Minnis said. “These kids were barely born.”
Since the inception of the team in 2002, Harvard had never seen sustained success until the Class of 2016 came onto the scene. In the 2011 season—the year prior to the arrival of “the super seven”—the Crimson finished 10-20, with a 5-9 record in conference play.
Just this campaign, attackers Robbie Fluegge, Noah Harrison, Chris Miao, Austen Novis, Lee, and 2-meter Ben Zepfel have shot for 116 goals, passed for 63 assists, and tallied a total of 168 steals. Goalie Colin Woolway has stopped 192 shots.
“This year is remarkably different from any of the past seasons,” Woolway said. “It’s been special to be a part of it and to see the group that has struggled in the past now contend for a championship.”
This season, the sophomores led the Crimson to a No. 17 national ranking and its first-ever CWPA regular-season title. For their efforts, Zepfel earned first-team All-CWPA honors and Harrison made the second team.
Woolway has also taken on an increased role. Last year, he shared the goal with now-senior Jimmy Field, but was called upon this season to take the majority of the time in the net.
“I think [being named starter] has definitely helped me in terms of getting in more of a groove,” Woolway explained. “That being said, my relationship with Jimmy is great...He continues to drive me in practice, and we continue to push each other.”
With 192 of the team’s 248 saves on the season, Woolway has earned his spot between the poles. His efforts in goal have been rewarded with a handful of CWPA defensive player of the week awards throughout the season.
“Colin has done a great job,” Minnis said. “He came in and worked really hard last year, had a good off-season, and came in and earned the starting spot this year. I don’t think he’s looked back since.”
The contributions from the sophomores have aided the Crimson in what Woolway considers one of the best Octobers Harvard water polo has ever seen. Over the course of the month, the Crimson went 7-3, coming away with a big win against Brown that placed the team third in the Ivy League Championship tournament.
“It’s been special to be a part of [this team] and see a group that has struggled in the past be able to bring it together this year,” Woolway said.
The squad continued its success into November, reaching the CWPA Northern Division championship game against St. Francis on Nov. 10. The team ultimately fell, however, 12-4. This past weekend, the Crimson’s season came to a close with a sixth-place finish at the CWPA Championships.
“We’re a very young team,” Minnis said. “I think you saw that in the championship game against St. Francis. They are a very experienced, senior-junior heavy team and…we got a little rattled late in the game. But all that experience is going to help us down the road.”
Despite the finish, the team is optimistic about its future prospects, with the class of 2016 set to lead the way. The sophomores believe that they are integral to both the future success of the squad and its recruitment of more game-changing players.
“I think our role as the [Class of 2016] is to continue Ted’s goal in attracting more players,” Lee said. “Harvard isn’t really known for being a powerhouse on the east coast...We’re starting to solidify our role as a threat and as a contender to win the east every year.”

In an incredibly rare confluence of events, Hanukkah and Thanksgiving will collide this year. This overlap is causing much excitement for Jews nationwide. In NYC, the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade will include a giant dreidel balloon. Los Angeles is holding a Thanksgivukkah Festival, which will feature performances from the Moshav Band and, of course, the renowned Jewish rapper Kosha Dillz. Even Boston is getting in the spirit with some special Thanksgivukkah cheer on display at the state house!
In honor of the upcoming mega-holiday, Flyby has rounded up a few ways you can make this miraculous, literally once-in-a-lifetime combination of Thanksgivukkah as epic and festive as can be.MenurkeysThe most iconic symbol of each holiday—turkey and the menorah—come together to make the hybrid that is the menurkey: a menorah shaped like a turkey. The creators of the menurkey even created the iMenurkey App (one of the most innovative and useful apps the iPhone has ever seen) in which you can virtually light the menurkey yourself. The app promises to satisfy “all your mobile menorah needs,” and is well worth the $1.99 download cost. The menurkey itself seems pretty well-suited to your holiday travels, too. Decades from now, the menurkey may well be the sole relic of this historic day.Sweet potato latkesSolve the cooking quandary that this holiday mash-up presents with a Thanksgiving twist on the famous Hanukkah treats. Serve them with cranberry-apple sauce if you’re feeling fancy.Turkallah/ChallarkeyThe name is self-explanatory. If you have the patience and culinary/artistic ability to do so, braid your challah into the shape of a turkey and you’ll be sure to impress all of your guests.Thanksgivukkah apparelTo really get into the holiday spirit and simultaneously make a bold fashion statement, you can sport some one-of-a-kind Thanksgivukkah t-shirts. Modern Tribe came up with the uber-creative Thanksgivukkah t-shirt logo “8 Days of Light Liberty & Latkes.” Zazzle even sells Thanksgivukkah aprons and Thanksgivukkah bodysuits for babies. Be sure to place a rush order!
