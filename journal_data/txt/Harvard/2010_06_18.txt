After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Daniel G. Ennis, executive dean for administration at Harvard Medical  School, will be leaving the University to assume the post of senior vice  president for  finance and administration at Johns Hopkins University, the Medical  School announced today.
Richard G. Mills, dean for education and  global program  administration, will serve as interim executive dean for administration  when Ennis leaves on July 30.
Ennis, who graduated from Harvard  Business School and Harvard Kennedy School of Government, served as the  associate vice president for finance and financial  planning at Harvard prior to joining the Medical School in 2007.
Since then, Ennis has helped guide the school through "choppy financial  waters"  and created a financial plan for the years to come. Ennis  has contributed to long-term plans for renovations in the Medical  School Quadrangle and associated departmental reorganization.
 
"I know  that,  like me, many in the HMS community are indebted to Daniel for his  trusted friendship, his outstanding leadership and his many lasting  contributions to HMS," wrote Medical School Dean Jeffrey  S.  Flier in an e-mailed statement.

Caryn R. Dutton, a University of Wisconsin professor who  played a central role in plans to offer late-term abortions in Madison, will be joining the faculty of Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital.
 
Dutton will be leaving her post as assistant  professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Wisconsin  School of Public Health, where she helped to plan the Madison Surgery  Center's second-trimester abortion services. Though the plans were  approved last year, they were never implemented due to opposition from  anti-abortion protesters.
The University of Wisconsin told the Associated Press that the school still plans to offer the controversial procedure despite Dutton's departure.
Prior to the announcement, Dutton had performed abortions at Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, whose President and CEO Teri Huyck thanked Dutton "for providing Wisconsin women with compassionate health care" as the group's associate medical director, according to the AP.
Dutton declined a request for comment  on Tuesday. Medical School spokesperson Alyssa C. Kneller confirmed that  Dutton will be joining the faculty of the Medical School as an  instructor in September.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As part of an ongoing organizational review of the central administration, the functions of the Allston Development Group and the University Planning Office will be integrated into a new department of Capital Planning and Project Management, Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp announced today.
The University has begun an "accelerated, targeted, national search" for a vice president to lead the new organization, which will unify the campus planning, capital planning, and project management responsibilities of ADG and UPO. The new vice president will collaborate closely with Lapp and other units across campus planning and project management, according to Lapp.
"This does not represent a change in focus concerning our development work in Boston or Cambridge," Lapp wrote in a statement, adding that she will continue to oversee the progress in Allston directly as well as work on departments within the central administration. "These groups are all part and parcel of our integrated approach to property stewardship, leasing, greening, and campus development."
The creation of the Capital Planning and Project Management organization represents yet another move toward reorganizing the coordination and efficiency of University departments. The first step, Lapp said, was the April appointment of Lisa Hogarty to the newly refashioned position of Vice President for Campus Services.
"I believe that this new organizational structure will improve our capital planning functions upholding our standards of excellence and commitment to efficiency of delivery as we strive to respond to academic needs and opportunities, while doing so in a way that supports our surrounding communities and neighbors," Lapp wrote.
The news of the pending consolidation of University offices comes on the heels of Christopher M. Gordon's announcement earlier this month that he would resign from his post as chief operating officer of the Allston Development Group, due to the halt on construction of Harvard's Allston campus. 
University President Drew G. Faust announced in December that the University would be halting construction of its $1 billion Allston Science Complex, the centerpiece of Harvard's planned 50-year expansion into Allston, due to financial troubles.

Psychology professor Matthew K. Nock, whose work focuses on self-injury and suicidal behavior, has been granted tenure, the University announced last week.
A member of the faculty since 2003, Nock has garnered many national and University awards, including two Harvard teaching awards and two American Psychological Association awards for his scientific contributions to the academic community.
The psychologist, whose teaching repertoire at Harvard includes a course on self-destructive behaviors, said he chose to continue his work at Harvard largely due to quality of the student body, whose passion for research has made his time at the University "really exciting."
Nock’s research seeks to explain why people commit suicide and engage in non-suicidal self-injury, such as burning or cutting themselves. Studies have shown that non-suicidal self-injury is a psychological disorder that affects roughly 4 percent of American adults and perhaps as high as 21 percent of adolescents, according to the press release announcing Nock’s appointment.
“As people age they [learn]  healthier ways of coping with problems they are experiencing,” said Nock, adding that behaviors  like burning or cutting are generally viewed as a “maladaptive  way to regulate one’s emotions.”
Nock is currently serving as a co-Principal Investigator on a five-year U.S. Army study about American soldiers suffering from suicidal behavior.
“In some cases, more soldiers die by suicide than in combat, which is really concerning,” said Nock, adding that the rate of suicide in the army has “skyrocketed” in recent years.
Though the study has only just begun, Nock said that he hopes its findings will help prevent suicides in the Army and lead researchers to develop a better understanding of suicide in the general population.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The case of Eric Balderas '13, an undocumented student facing possible deportation to Mexico, has sparked conversation about his years spent living in the shadows and has brought to the fore the debate over proposed legislation that would grant citizenship to illegal immigrants.
In the past, Balderas used his Mexican passport as  sufficient identification to board domestic flights. But having lost his  passport that weekend, he tried to board a plane from his hometown of San Antonio, Texas to Boston last Monday  with his Mexican consulate card and Harvard identification instead—prompting the  attention of immigration officials who soon discovered Balderas’  undocumented status.
In the days following the news of his detainment and possible  deportation to Mexico, Balderas has publicized his support for legislation that he views as one of his few lifelines to remain in the  United States: the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors  Act, or the DREAM Act, which would potentially offer a six-year-long  conditional path toward U.S. citizenship.
Balderas’ supporters have been rallying behind the DREAM Act and  providing reasons he should be permitted to stay in the United States—but those who believe that Balderas should  be deported to Mexico have raised their voices as well.
BLIND TO CITIZENSHIP
Balderas’ recent uncovering as an illegal immigrant has provoked some to wonder how he has been able to live in the shadows for so long.
At Harvard, where 20 percent of the students are from outside the United States, a student’s nationality does not play a role in admissions decisions.
“There is no citizenship requirement at Harvard,” said Kevin Galvin, director of news and media relations. “The University admits qualified students from all around the globe, and we believe that the diversity of talent and experience which our students bring augments the teaching and educational experience at Harvard.”
University President Drew G. Faust has advocated for the DREAM Act, writing a letter to Mass. Rep. Michael E. Capuano in May 2009 and meeting with recently elected U.S. Senator Scott P. Brown in part to urge him to support the DREAM Act.
According to Shu Ohno, deputy director of communications for National Immigration Forum, no one is obligated to tell the government or even question anyone else about his or her legal status unless that individual is seeking employment.
After acceptance into an American college, international students generally apply for F-1 student visas to gain entry into the United States. But undocumented students who were accepted from within the United States—like Balderas—are not eligible for the student visa, which requires a permanent residence abroad and no intention to leave that residence.
Ohno said that Balderas would have had to return to Mexico and apply for a student visa, upon which he would be barred for 10 years by the U.S. government due to existing records of his illegal residence in the United States.
Even if Balderas were to fulfill the 10-year-miniumum bar, the chances of an actual return would be slim—as a result, Ohno, a proponent of the DREAM Act, said he believes that Balderas should be allowed to stay in the country.
“We’re taking one of our best and brightest in the country and potentially kicking him out of the country for no good reason,” Ohno said. “When you think about the loss to the family, community, to the university...throwing him out of the country—it’s irrational.”
‘RULE OF LAW’ 
But opponents of the DREAM Act contend that the legislation enables the government to reward those who have committed a crime by illegally entering the country or overextending their stay.
In that vein, the Federation for American Immigration Reform—a national organization that seeks to improve border security and stop illegal immigration—opposes the proposal, viewing it as a “classic example of a mixed message,” according to FAIR spokesman Ira H. Mehlman. The DREAM Act, he said, seems to tell illegal immigrant parents, “Don’t come here, but if you do, your kids will be rewarded.”
Balderas—who said he cannot remember ever not speaking English—was only 4-years-old when he immigrated to the United States from Mexico with his family to escape domestic violence. Balderas' supporters argue that undocumented youth like him did not have a say in choosing to break the law when crossing into the United States.
But Jim Gilchrist, founder and president of the immigration law enforcement advocacy group Minuteman Project, said that if the United States is to be governed by the rule of law, the rule of law must not exempt any individual.
With approximately 11 million illegal aliens in the country and 25 million legal residents who are unemployed, illegal immigration amnesty creates more competition for jobs, according to Roy H. Beck, president of Numbers USA, an immigration reduction group that is not anti-immigration, legal or illegal. In addition, granting amnesty to illegal immigrants encourages chain migration.
“There’s no question that [Balderas] and students like him are in a difficult situation, but it is a situation of his parents’ making,” Mehlman said. “When parents violate the immigration law, somehow society has to deal with the consequences.”
Though Beck said he believes that students like Balderas need a legal remedy for their undocumented status, he added that the remedy has to create as small a negative impact on the legal residents in the United States as possible—which the DREAM Act, as currently proposed, would not provide.
For one, Beck said, the amnesty would create incentives for more people to break the law, and people who did break the law—the parents who brought over their children—should not be able to benefit from the amnesty.
In the aftermath of Balderas’ detainment on Monday, friends and activists of immigration reform have rallied to his defense, highlighting the former valedictorian’s academic prowess and arguing that his deportation would stand a loss to American society—particularly given his interest in becoming a cancer researcher.
But Gilchrist said that there is “no carte blanche” for breaking the law—even for Balderas, who is “obviously a brilliant young man.”
“We can’t have one set of rules for smart people and one set of rules for stupid people,” Mehlman said.
As a consequence of the rule of law, Gilchrist said that Balderas must be repatriated and apply for re-entry at the appropriate time.
“Not to hold that position would be to say that the rule of law is meaningless.” Gilchrist said. “It’s a sorry story for Senor Balderas, but it’s a good story for the rule of law.”

While most high school students are assigned a list of books to read over the summer, undergraduates aren't required to do much at all during the summer months. Just in case you've been using the excuse of "But I don't know what to read!" to avoid any and all intellectual engagement, we here at Flyby asked some of Harvard's brightest minds for summer reading recommendations. Here's what they suggested.
Nancy M. Cline - Roy E. Larsen Librarian of Harvard College
Mountains Beyond Mountains: The Quest of Dr. Paul Farmer, a Man Who Would Cure the World, by J. Tracy Kidder '67
I would suggest Mountains Beyond Mountains by Tracy Kidder. It is now available in an inexpensive paperback edition, perfect for slipping into a backpack or beach tote and also in digital format (and also there are copies in several Harvard libraries!)
This is not a new book. I suggest it now because it is about the work of Paul Farmer and colleagues who worked with him to found Partners in Health, an organization that has grown to have an important impact on several areas of the world. What caused me to return to this book (after first reading it a few years ago) was the earthquake in Haiti. Reading about the extraordinary challenges that Farmer and his team faced in delivering health care and building community-based programs gave considerable insight to the problems that continue to complicate the recovery of Haiti. The story is compelling. It helps one become more attentive to the diverse aspects of different countries’ economic and social conditions, to perhaps better understand why aid sometimes does not work as intended, and to appreciate the generous and proud spirit that can survive amidst poverty.
Now, I’m about to start on Kidder’s more recent book, Strength in What Remains.
Paul E. Farmer - Maude and Lillian Presley Professor of Global Health and Social Medicine at Harvard Medical School; Head of the Department of Global Health and Social Medicine at Harvard Medical School
Blessed Unrest: How the Largest Movement in the World Came into Being and Why No One Saw It Coming, by Paul Hawken; Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, by Jane Austen and Seth Grahame-Smith
I'd encourage anyone to read Blessed Unrest by Paul Hawken. Those of us who think of ourselves as (or who have become, reluctantly) leaders of the social-justice movement could stand a reminder that we must also be humble participants in it—and that "our" movement is THE movement, that the fight for access to health care and education and justice and dignity is also the fight for a safer world and one that will sustain us. As Hawken says, "There is no question that the environmental movement is critical to our survival. Our house is literally burning, and it is only logical that environmentalists expect the social justice movement to get on the environmental bus. But it is the other way around; the only way we are going to put out the fire is to get on the social justice bus and heal our wounds, because in the end, there is only one bus."
And then for dessert, if you're so inclined—and if you share my aversion to Jane Austen—the nunchuk-laced send-up of regency England Pride and Prejudice and Zombies.
Niall C. D. Ferguson - Laurence A. Tisch Professor of History and Professor of Business Administration; William Ziegler Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School
The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, by Edward Gibbon
Undergraduate summers are the time for serious reading. I would urge students to read as much as they can of Edward Gibbon's The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, still the greatest work of historical writing in English. The combination of erudition and irony is exquisite. It is also an invaluable guide to the symptoms of imperial decline, which could come in handy in the years ahead.
Melissa Franklin - Mallinckrodt Professor of Physics
The Star Thrower, by Loren C. Eiseley
Eiseley wrote wonderful dreamy essays about science and nature which always start my mind wandering freely. He somehow combines the best of travel writing with the best of science writing. Any of his collections of essays are great, in case you can't find this one. I suggest this book... because he spends most of his time in these essays trying to bring the big picture into tiny fascinating details—perfect for the summer.
Howard E. Gardner '65 - The John H. and Elisabeth A. Hobbs Professor of Cognition and Education at the Harvard Graduate School of Education
Gandhi's Truth: On the Origins of Militant Nonviolence, by Erik H. Erikson
I consider Mahatma Gandhi to be the most remarkable and most important human being of the last millennium, and so I think students should know about him—and not just from the movie about him starring Ben Kingsley. Erik Erikson was my undergraduate tutor at Harvard in the early 1960s. He was a psychoanalyst with a deep understanding of youth who had a profound influence on me and many others in my cohort. By reading Gandhi's Truth, students will secure insights into two persons well worth knowing about...
Henry Louis Gates, Jr. - Alphonse Fletcher, Jr., University Professor
Their Eyes Were Watching God, by Zora Neale Hurston
My choice is Zora Neale Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God. For those many undergraduates who have read it already, read it again. It is the richest novel and bears numerous re-readings. For those who haven't read it yet, get a copy, and enjoy!
Daniel Gilbert - Professor of Psychology; Harvard College Professor
Connected: The Surprising Power of Our Social Networks and How They Shape Our Lives, by Nicholas A. Christakis and James H. Fowler '92
I am a big fan of Connected by Nicholas Christakis (on our faculty) and James Fowler. It is a brilliant and engaging description of the astounding ways in which we are shaped by our social networks.
N. Gregory Mankiw - Robert M. Beren Professor of Economics
Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance: An Inquiry into Values, by Robert M. Pirsig
It doesn't have much to do with Zen Buddhism or even motorcycle maintenance. Rather, it is a unique and deeply enjoyable novel laced with thought-provoking philosophical ruminations.
Helen Vendler - A. Kingsley Porter University Professor
The Bible
A book of the Bible (almost any one that is part of the cultural deposit of stories and lyrics—Genesis, Exodus, Ruth, Job, Psalms, one of the Gospels, Revelation). Because of the separation of church and state in the United States, there is no academic subject in which the Bible is taught to [undergraduates] in elementary or high school, and many remain unacquainted with it. It would be a pity to miss these books, drawn on so extensively by literature, the visual arts, and music.
