After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If pop culture today held a mirror up to itself, what would it see? A five second clip from the music video for “Sexy and I Know It”? Nicki Minaj’s head on Taylor Lautner’s body? Any amalgamation of various cultural sensations is bound to be jumbled and confusing. However, sometimes a cultural phenomenon comes along that gives us the opportunity to take a good, clear look at ourselves. This music video of Carly Rae Jensen’s “Call Me Maybe” does just that for today’s youth, and we see spontaneity, quirkiness, and lots of fun.
The viral video features Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez along with Ashley Tisdale, three of four leads in Big Time Rush, and other music and television stars such as Martin Johnson of Boys Like Girls singing and dancing along to Carly Rae Jepsen’s recent hit. What they have in store for us is three minutes of head bobbing, booty popping action. Its unscripted, carefree nature gives us a more intimate side of these celebrities that we can relate to.
But is the video really undirected and unscripted? What are the chances that these performers, whose ages range from 18 to 26 years old, met up just to have some fun and, oh, I don’t know, film a quick video that currently has twenty million hits on YouTube? Subtle hints in the video seem to suggest, however, that the making of the video was, in fact, largely spontaneous. One of the most obvious is that everything is flipped horizontally: letters on shirts and books are reflected and Dustin Belt’s guitar appears left-handed, implying that the video was probably shot with a laptop computer rather than with a camera. The video also only goes up to a resolution of 480p, unusual for a professionally produced music video. These clues make the video seem geniune as opposed to being a product of the pop industry.
Ultimately, the video was made for fun and mirrors the mentality of the young generation of America. When Ashley Tisdale and Justin Bieber make fools of themselves dancing to this song, they look just like me and my friends when we do the same—and being able to see into the lives of celebrities and realizing they might not be so different from us is very aluring to many watching at home. Celebrities and Youtube-watchers alike just want to have a good time—speaking of which, Selena, if you’re reading this, call me, maybe?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED March 12, 2012, at 10:01 p.m.
Facebook co-founder Christopher R. Hughes ’06 announced Friday that he had purchased a majority stake in The New Republic, a magazine owned and edited for 35 years by former Harvard lecturer Martin “Marty” H. Peretz.
Hughes will assume Peretz’s titles of publisher and editor-in-chief of the Washington-based magazine. The details of the purchase have not been made public.
In a letter published by the magazine on Friday, Hughes wrote that he hopes to maintain the legacy of The New Republic’s long-form journalism while increasing the predominantly print publication’s use of new technology.
“The web has introduced a competitive, and some might argue hostile, landscape for long, in-depth, resource-intensive journalism,” Hughes wrote. “Although the method of delivery of important ideas has undergone drastic change over the past 15 years, the hunger for them has not dissipated.
“In the next era of The New Republic, we will aggressively adapt to the newest information technologies without sacrificing our commitment to serious journalism,” he added.
Peretz praised Hughes as someone who argues well and who cares deeply about the future of the magazine.
Speaking about his successor’s commitment to academics, Peretz cited Hughes’ undergraduate history and literature thesis on the Algerian Revolution. Hughes’ coupling of entrepreneurial success and academic interest made him stand out from other suitors, Peretz said.
“His own background in Facebook and other matters reassures us that he will carry us into the new generation of what magazines are going to be,” Peretz said. “There has never been anybody really around The New Republic who knew about these things and was committed to integrating them into the life of the magazine.”
That know-how will undoubtedly be bolstered by Hughes’ personal fortune. The Facebook co-founder is estimated to be worth $700 million—a figure which will likely increase when the company led by his former Harvard roommate Mark Zuckerberg goes public in the coming months.
In an interview with the New York Times, Hughes said that he is not hoping to turn a profit from the magazine and is willing to spend at a time when many rival publications are struggling to make ends meet.
Peretz said it is likely Hughes will increase the size of the magazine’s staff immediately and expand its coverage.
Hughes, who served as the first Facebook spokesperson, left the company in 2007 to serve as the director of social media for then-Senator Barack Obama’s presidential campaign. Hughes most recently founded Jumo, a social networking site for nonprofit organizations.
Hughes’ ownership continues a long tradition of Harvard alumni at the magazine, whose outsized political influence has often dwarfed its circulation. At many points, it has resembled a Harvard club that served as the launching pad for promising political writers and editors coming out of the University.
The magazine was founded in 1914 by Herbert D. Croly, who attended Harvard in the 19th century and received an honorary degree, and Walter Lippmann, Class of 1910. Over the years, the New Republic has counted four more Harvard alumni as editor and many others as writers.
Peretz, who left his position as a House Master at Harvard after taking over as editor-in-chief in 1975, said that he will not retain any ownership in the company but will likely write for the magazine.
“I’ve done the magazine for 38 years, and I’m going to do what [Hughes] wants me to do,” Peretz said. “I’m now almost 73, so it’s a good time. It’s probably too late, even, to have done this.”
Peretz—one of the early head tutors of the social studies concentration—came under fire at Harvard in 2010 after writing a controversial blog post for The New Republic which included the statement “Muslim life is cheap.”
Protest by five student groups led to Peretz’s removal from the list of speakers at the Committee on Degrees in Social Studies’ 50th anniversary celebration.
Hughes could not be reached for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sometimes, it takes a little luck.
In double overtime—the first between Harvard and Yale since 1934—junior Conor Morrison fired a shot point blank at Bulldog goalie Nick Maricic, who apparently made the save and smothered the puck.
But sophomore Dan Ford saw something that no one else on the ice had. The puck had actually trickled out toward the left circle, and while everyone was crashing the net, Ford took a slapshot that easily hit the back of the net, propelling the Crimson to a 4-3 double overtime win.
It was only appropriate that it would come down to yet another overtime game Saturday night for the Harvard men’s hockey (11-9-11, 8-5-9 ECAC) team at a packed Bright Hockey Center.
It took two extra periods, but the Crimson was finally able to pull off its first overtime win on its 14th try, staving off elimination and setting up a do-or-die match Sunday night.
“This time of year, it comes down to making a play,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “We’re happy to live for another day, and it should be an entertaining game tomorrow.”
It looked as if the Crimson was going to wrap this one up during regulation, scoring three unanswered goals after the Bulldogs (16-15-3, 10-10-2) had scored two soft goals in the first period to go ahead, 2-0.
Yale had other plans. With an extra attacker, the Bulldogs knotted up the score at three with 27 seconds remaining in the game.
The home team had been the dominant, more physical team for most of the contest, outshooting Yale, 39-30, at that point and killing all nine Bulldogs power plays. But for the second straight night, the game proceeded into overtime.
“It’s kind of a heartbreaker to give up a goal with less than a minute left,” Ford said. “But we’re kind of used to it, and we knew we’d get back to playing the way we play, and we got the result we wanted at the end.”
The first overtime was a hard-fought affair, with Crimson sophomore goalie Raphael Girard coming up with four huge saves on a relentless power play—Yale’s 11th of the night—towards the end of the period.
Harvard ended the thriller 9:20 in the second overtime. Senior Colin Moore sent a pass from the right corner behind the net to Morrison, playing in only his second game since the season's opening weekend, and the junior one-timed the pass into Maricic. Ford found the puck and ended the game with a high shot amidst mass confusion surrounding the net.
Junior Danny Biega scored the first and third goals for the Crimson in the second and third periods, respectively, both slapshots from the point early on in the power play.
“Those [were] big-time shots by a guy who looked like he was going to refuse to let us lose tonight,” Donato said.
Senior Alex Killorn assisted on both, notching his 100th career point on the first Biega goal. Freshman and ECAC Rookie of the Year nominee Patrick McNally earned his second three-assist game of the season, assisting on the two Biega scores as well as junior Marshall Everson’s goal.
Everson scored early in a power play in the second period with a shot from the left circle after Harvard had solid control of the puck around the point.
“When we’ve had success with our power play, it’s really been [through] sharing the puck,” Donato said. “I think we had it moving around a little bit there.”
The Bulldogs opened the scoring 5:17 into the first period, as Colin Dueck netted his first goal of the season on a shot from the point that went through the five-hole. Chad Ziegler put Yale up by two at 16:36 in the first with a one-time wrist shot after a pass up from the left boards by Andrew Miller.
Overall, the Crimson outshot the Bulldogs, 53-51, and shut the visitors out on the power play, handing them an 0-for-11 night. Harvard’s power play was successful in three of nine attempts.
Girard had 48 saves and Maricic had 49 in the Crimson’s fourth longest playoff game in team history.
With the third straight game less than 24 hours away, there was little time to celebrate Saturday night’s victory against the defending ECAC champions.
“Obviously we’re really excited to play tomorrow,” Ford said. “[We’re] exhausted. It was a good moment for about 10 minutes, but now we’re trying to focus on tomorrow’s game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a bit anticlimactic after two straight overtime thrillers the previous two nights, but the Harvard men’s hockey team finally knocked off Yale. Coming back from a 1-0 series deficit to take the deciding Game 3 Sunday night, the Crimson defeated the Bulldogs, 8-2, in a dominant showing at the Bright Hockey Center.
The Crimson will move on to the ECAC Championship Weekend, where it will face Cornell in the semifinals on March 16 in Atlantic City, N.J. It will be the first time Harvard has made the ECAC semifinals since losing to Princeton in the championship game in 2008.
“We really felt, five-on-five, we carried the play for most of night,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “We had what it took to get it done, and we were confident being at home we were going to be able to finish the job tonight.”
After finishing the first period tied at one, Harvard broke open the game with an explosive four-goal second period, including senior Alex Killorn’s 50th score of his career.
“I definitely don’t want to retire that Harvard jersey for as long as I can,” Killorn said. “Tonight was the last chance for our seniors to play at the Bright Center, so it was definitely something special.”
Junior David Valek recorded a hat trick, scoring two in the second and one on the power play in the closing seconds. All three of Valek’s scores came on a different Bulldog goalie.
Sophomore goalie Raphael Girard continued his strong play for the Crimson, saving 39 shots in a game that quickly turned into a blowout.
“It was just one of those games where everything was going our way, and the puck kept going into the back of the net,” Killorn said.
Yale netted the first goal of the game 4:04 into the first. Nicholas Weberg kept the puck in along the boards and sent the puck bouncing up the left side of the ice. After it hit Clinton Bourbonais’ foot, Chad Ziegler gathered the puck and sent it into the back of net with a backhand.
Harvard responded about three minutes later on a goal by Killorn. Despite having two defenders all over him, he skated up the left side through the defense and dragged the puck across the net before sending it through Bulldogs goalie Nick Maricic’s five-hole to knot the score at one.
The second period was a completely different story. The Crimson pounced on the Bulldogs for four goals in the second frame, breaking open the contest and putting Harvard up, 5-1.
Junior Alex Fallstrom opened the scoring on a wraparound wrist shot 35 seconds into the period after Killorn initially sent the puck down to him by the right goal line.
The Crimson’s second goal of the period came after freshman Tommy O’Regan won the puck on the boards behind the net and sent it back up to junior Danny Biega. The blueliner then tapped it to junior David Valek, who fired a hard high wrist shot from center that made its way into the net.
Killorn was at it again for Harvard’s third goal of night. With the score, Killorn became the first player to tally 50 career goals for the Crimson since Tim Pettit ’04. Captain Ryan Grimshaw passed the puck up from the defensive zone to Killorn rushing up the right side, who then faked a pass to junior Marshall Everson before cutting back to the backhand, faking out Maricic and netting the goal.
Everson scored the last goal of the period on the rush after Killorn, streaking on the right side, found the open junior forward on the left.
Harvard showed no signs of slowing down in the third period and quickly dashed any Bulldog hopes of a comeback, as Valek scored just 1:50 into the final frame, burying a rebound from freshman Patrick McNally’s shot.
“We just wanted to keep going,” Killorn said. “At one point they beat us, 7-1, and I don’t think anyone on our team forgot about that by any means, so that was something that kind of fed us. We knew that it could be our last game, so every shift was so important.”
To seal the game, Moriarty capitalized on a rebound after Yale goalie Connor Wilson let Biega’s slapshot fall in front of an open net. Valek completed the hat trick with 19 seconds left in the game.
Yale was able to score its first power-play goal of the series on its 18th try after Antoine Laganiere capitalized on a five minute major by freshman Colin Blackwell.
Knocking off the defending ECAC champions, the Crimson will look to win its own title—its first since 2006—this weekend against Cornell in the semifinals and either Union or Colgate in the finals.
“I think we belong in Atlantic City,” Donato said. “We’re excited, [but] we’re not just happy to be there. We feel that we can make a run at the league championship."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While most Harvard students were finishing up classes and leaving for spring break on Friday, senior Leslie Rea and sophomores Alex Stanton and Schuyler Moore were already off campus at the NCAA Zone A Diving Championship meet in Buffalo, N.Y.
"That meet's really cool because [you] get to see people who are a lot better than you and just dive with a whole different group than we're used to during our regular season," Stanton said.
After qualifying for the meet during the competition season, the divers needed to take first in the one-meter or the three-meter to continue on to the NCAA Division I Championship meet. The task proved to be too tall for the Crimson divers.
"It's definitely not the best our team has done," Rea said. "But we had [Ivy League] championships two weeks ago, and that's what we train for the entire year. So being able to hold it out for two more weeks is a little rough, but I think for all that we practiced, we did well."
Stanton echoed Rea's sentiments, noting how much preparation went into the Ivy League meet, at which Harvard snatched a first-place victory.
"The two weeks after [the Ivy League meet] are just a hard time because after championships, we want to take a little bit of a break because we were working so hard towards it," Stanton said.  "We were practicing, just not as much as we wanted to, and [we were] just kind of exhausted from the whole season."
While Moore and Stanton—who hit the board on her third dive—finished the one-meter quarter final with scores of 181.55 and 194.9, respectively, Rea's 13th-place finish (240.4) earned her a spot in the finals, as the top 18 advanced to perform six more dives to add on to their preliminary scores. At the end of the day, Rea's consistency had moved her up two places to finish 11th with 480.3 points.
"Technically, the people who are the most consistent, they're the ones who should be on top winning," Rea said.  "But the people who have a good meet the first time and a bad meet the second time, those are the ones who will move down."
Harvard finished out the three-meter diving competition with Rea placing 21st in the quarterfinals with 241.2 points, followed by Stanton in 30th with 227.75 points.
"I'm extremely happy with how it went," Rea said.  "It ended on a really high note.  We were showing...that the Ivy League [belongs] there with the state schools."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
And the troubles continue for Jeremy Lin ’10 and his New York Knicks. The Knicks dropped their fifth game in eight days on Sunday afternoon, losing further ground in the competition for the Eastern Conference’s final playoff spot with a 106-94 loss to the Philadelphia 76ers.
Lin did not come out of the locker room strong, as he began the game shooting only one for five from the field. His play did not pick up from there—he finished 5 for 18 for the day, committing a game-high six turnovers along the way.
The Harvard alum suggested that his recent slump has to do with the adjustments that defenses are making to his style of play.
“I’m getting used to being like the primary, or top one, two, three things on the scouting report and seeing a lot of different people try to take away what I was comfortable with,” Lin said after the game. “I need to make sure I stay aggressive and I don’t change anything in terms of my approach. I can make better decisions, but I can’t change my approach.”
Sunday afternoon marked the fourth time in five games that Lin has shot worse than 50 percent from the field and the third time in that same time range that he has had at least five turnovers.
The point guard’s teammates were not much better though, and, once again, the Knicks were forced to attempt a wild fourth-quarter comeback. And, similar to previous games, this run proved futile.
Coach Mike D’Antoni chose an…interesting style for the final period, as he benched team superstars Carmelo Anthony and Amar’e Stoudemire for the entire twelve minutes. The outcome of this? Well, along with the loss, “Fire D’Antoni” chants were heard in Madison Square Garden for perhaps the first time since Linsanity began.
The Knicks’ schedule does not get any easier from here on out, as they play the leaders of the Eastern Conference, the Chicago Bulls, Monday night. Lin’s competition? None other than reigning MVP Derrick Rose.
In order for this deteriorating New York ball club to get back on track, something other than MSG’s angry yells are going to need to break through and hit the team hard. They need an unexpected player to check into the game and provide a spark. Where have we heard that one before?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard softball team is off to a strong start in spring break play after sweeping its first six games on the West Coast.
The Crimson (11-3) went undefeated in five contests in the Northridge Classic before traveling to Los Angeles and downing Utah State, 9-5, on Monday.
“These wins are huge for us, showing not only that we can beat big teams like Oregon and Utah State, but also that we have the consistency to come out strong six games in a row,” senior shortstop Jane Alexander said. “Our success this weekend took everyone on our team. With 21 people, we have pinch runners, pinch hitters, fresh legs in the field, and an overwhelming energy.”
Senior Rachel Brown lived up to her title as this week’s Ivy League Pitcher of the Week, allowing just two runs and striking out 30 batters in 22 2/3 innings pitched.
“Rachel was a force on the mound for us this last weekend,” said co-captain and first baseman Whitney Shaw. “She buckled down against some really strong teams...and gave us some wins that are crucial to achieving our preseason team goals. She was a rock out there this weekend and executed her job brilliantly.”
HARVARD 9, UTAH STATE 5
In its lone game in the City of Angels, Harvard extended its winning streak to six games with a victory over Utah State (8-14).
It was a solid day for the Crimson offense, as five different batters tallied at least two hits. Among those five was sophomore third baseman Kasey Lange, who went 3-for-3 with two RBI doubles and a single.
Sophomore hurler Laura Ricciardone fanned four in five innings to record the win. Brown came on in relief in the sixth and struck out five in under two innings of work.
HARVARD 3, MAINE 2
In its fifth game of the tournament, Harvard extended its winning streak to five games with a 3-2 win against Maine (5-16) on Sunday.
Both squads brought their pitching A-game, with neither being able to score until the fifth inning, when Crimson junior centerfielder Stephanie Regan ripped an RBI double. Harvard soon upped its lead to two runs, as Alexander’s single up the middle drove in Regan.
Freshman first baseman Adrienne Hume smacked an RBI double to earn Harvard one more run in the top of the sixth. The Black Bears responded with a two-run rally in the bottom of the inning but were unable to do any damage to overcome the one-run deficit in the seventh.
HARVARD 3, OREGON STATE 2
Day 3 of the Northridge Classic opened with a close 3-2 Crimson victory over Oregon State (21-7) on Sunday.
Harvard nabbed a one-run advantage in the first inning thanks to sophomore catcher Allison Scott’s RBI double. The Crimson then did not score again until the fifth inning, when Lange knocked a single past second base to drive home freshman centerfielder Andrea Del Conte.
The pressure was on for Harvard in the top of the sixth inning, as the Beavers drove in two runs to tie the score up at 2-2.  Up for its last licks, the Crimson secured its 3-2 victory as junior leftfielder Ashley Heritage crossed home plate on a wild pitch.
HARVARD 5, CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE 2
In its second game of the weekend against the Matadors (5-19), Harvard took an early one-run lead on Saturday and never looked back, ultimately grabbing a 5-2 victory to deny Cal State Northridge redemption for its opening loss.
After Regan scored on a throwing error in the top of the first, the Crimson tacked on three more runs in the second inning to put the Matadors in an early 4-0 hole.
Cal State Northridge tried to ignite comebacks in the third and seventh innings but were held to a lone run in each attempt thanks to the strong pitching of Ricciardone. Harvard plated in a run in the seventh inning as well, when freshman Camilla Gibson scored on Lange’s ground out.
HARVARD 2, CSU BAKERSFIELD 0
The Crimson began Day 2 of tournament play with a 2-0 win in a pitcher’s duel against CSU Bakersfield (7-13).
Both teams were kept scoreless until the fifth inning, when Regan singled up the middle to bring sophomore right fielder Shelbi Olson home. Harvard scored one last time in the sixth, as rookie outfielder Katherine Appelbe’s single knocked in freshman second baseman Katherine Lantz. Brown allowed just one hit in a complete game shutout.
HARVARD 3, CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE 0
In the Crimson’s tournament opener on Friday, Brown struck out a season-high 13 batters en route to a 3-0 Harvard win.
Alexander came home on a fielding error in the first inning, and Lange added to the Crimson lead with a solo homer in the fourth.
The final Harvard run came in during the bottom of the fifth, when Appelbe reached home on Alexander’s sacrifice fly.

Harvard Basketball has made it to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 1946. For those of you who just can't miss the opportunity to see the Crimson play in person, Flyby is here to provide you with travel plans.
First things first. Harvard will play Vanderbilt in Albuquerque, N.M. on Thursday, March 15, with tipoff scheduled for 2:40 p.m. Mountain Daylight Time (4:40 p.m. Eastern Standard Time). If victorious, the Crimson will play the winner of the Wisconsin vs. Montana contest on March 17. Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight games will be played in Boston on March 22 and 24.
Assuming you're flying, you're in the market for a departure on March 14 and a return on March 18. This affords you the opportunity to spend Saturday night either celebrating in the saloons of the Wild West or crying in your hotel room. A pessimist may want to purchase a one-way ticket now and buy a return after Thursday's game, but for those of you who are confident in Harvard's prowess or just don't mind spending a couple days touring Albuquerque (stay tuned for an upcoming Flyby post about things to do while there), a roundtrip ticket will do just fine.
According to priceline.com, the cheapest and most convenient outbound ticket leaves Boston at 4:50 p.m. on Wednesday, March 14 and arrives in Albuquerque at 10:50 p.m. after a layover in Dallas (American Airlines 1747/657), but only three seats remain! The least expensive return option leaves the desert sands of Albuquerque at 9:40 a.m. on March 18 and arrives in Boston after a layover in Phoenix at 7:27 a.m., just in time for Monday classes (US Airways 530/226). The optimal combination is currently $871.20 after taxes, which certainly isn't the cheapest option.
Alternatively, for those of you who prefer to take the scenic route, Greyhound offers a one-way ticket to Albuquerque for $217.80, if you make your purchase online. The bus leaves South Station at 1:00 a.m. Tuesday morning. Factoring in transfers in New York and St. Louis, you'll arrive at 6:35 a.m. on Thursday. Unfortunately, you're a little too late for Amtrak. The last train left this morning at 11:55 a.m.
You could also drive. Google Maps gives the distance of this ten-state tour as 2,260 miles, drivable in 1 day and 13 hours at a cool average of just over 61 mph.  Assuming the national average of $3.79 per gallon and fuel efficiency in a ZipCar Ford Focus of 35 miles per gallon, that comes to $490 for fuel roundtrip. Still not cheap, but if you find the right parking lot, hotel is optional.
Or, you could also just watch the game on TV.
