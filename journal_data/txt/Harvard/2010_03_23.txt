After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In “Terribly Happy,” Danish director Henrik Ruben Genz’s latest thriller, the residents of Skarrild, a small, despondent Danish village in southern Jutland, have discovered a foolproof way to eliminate their problems: plunge them into the mysterious town bog. As a voiceover in the film’s opening scene recounts, the bog first achieved fame when a cow, after being buried in the bog for months, reemerged and gave birth to a calf with two heads, one of a calf and the other human. The beast subsequently incited a plague of mad cow disease and took the lives of the town’s unborn children until it was finally submerged back into the bog. Unfortunately, the film’s shortcomings don’t vanish quite so readily. While “Terribly Happy” boasts an interesting premise and effective visual elements, its superficial characters render the film disappointingly mediocre.
The film begins promisingly, as baby-faced Copenhagen cop Robert Hansen (Jakob Cedergren) is relocated to the rural town. Immediately upon his arrival, Robert’s big-city customs provoke hostility from the locals. They resent everything about him—from the way he reprimands petty theft, to his preference of soda water over beer—and the plot seems to percolate with conflict. Compounding the rural-urban clash, Robert is soon sexually propositioned by a married woman, Ingelise (Lene Maria Christensen), who claims that her husband, Jorgen (Kim Bodnia), beats her. What ensues is a love-triangle ripe with violence and unexpected twists. As Robert learns to adapt to his surroundings and situation, he eventually finds himself inextricably mired in the more figurative bog of Skarrild’s crime, revenge, and complicity.
To its credit, “Terribly Happy” does feature striking cinematography and visual motifs which complement the movie’s larger themes. Early on, stark, desolate shots of the Danish countryside establish the harshness of life in Skarrild. Additionally, poignant portraits of Skarrild’s grim residents throughout the film evoke a melancholy commensurate to many of the disturbing plot points. And when Dorthe, Ingelise’s daughter, takes the baby carriage out for a walk, the creepy creaking of the wheels and the image of a solitary young girl, alone in the town’s dark streets, \foreshadow the strange and chilling events which come to dominate the movie’s storyline.
While these elements of “Terribly Happy” are effective, however, the shallow characters make the movie less than memorable. Robert, the protagonist, never once demonstrates self-reflection or divulges the motivations for his actions. It seems logical that as he increasingly reveals himself to be the opposite of the innocent cop he appears to be, he would simultaneously reveal the hidden personality traits which lead him to commit the atrocities he perpetrates during the film. But Robert completely maintains his superficial, ingenuous demeanor throughout the movie. This disconnect between his behavior and his bearing seems to leave Robert an empty shell, rendering the protagonist and the center of the film’s action unrelatable.
Other characters are woefully under-developed. Though complicated emotions certainly underscore her character’s actions, Ingelise remains fairly flat throughout the movie. At one point, she mentions to Robert how oppressive she considers rural life in Skarrild, but the passing comment is about as far as she goes in explaining herself. Her marriage to Jorgen seems rife with complexity, as they seem to share both true affection and animosity for each other. But the film never probes beyond the surface of their relationship. Again, this lack of depth and virtual impossibility of empathizing with a crucial character leaves the movie unsatisfying.
In the end, the film’s high points, such as its promising plotline and noteworthy visuals, are outweighed by the flimsiness of the principal characters. Like the land, the characters, and even the cows, “Terribly Happy” seems hopelessly mired, though in mediocrity rather than mud. Beyond the merits of a harrowing depiction of life in the Danish countryside, this merely passable film fails to achieve its full potential.

Dear Robert Pattinson fans: Allen Coulter’s “Remember Me” will probably disappoint you. The film is kind of a love story, yes, and Robert Pattinson is as delicious as ever. However, this film is mostly just brooding and grim, threaded with tension but marred by pretension. Ultimately, the poignant scenes scattered throughout cannot salvage the film’s disjointed nature and inconsistent pacing.
In “Remember Me,” two separate, ultimately intertwining familial threads dominate the story. Fast-forward ten years from the jarring opening sequence of her mother’s murder and Ally Craig (Emilie de Ravin) is a student at NYU, alongside the quintessential antihero, Tyler Hawkins played by Pattinson himself. He rebels against an aloof father (Pierce Brosnan) by living wholly without purpose, all the while fiercely protective of his sister Caroline (Ruby Jerins), which may or may not be due to their older brother’s suicide. One night, Tyler and his roommate Aidan (Tate Ellington) implicate themselves in a street fight, and a cop (Chris Cooper) throws the roommates into jail. After Tyler’s father bails them out, Aidan hatches a plan for Tyler to vindictively seduce then dump the cop’s daughter, Ally, who shares a class with Tyler. Predictably, Ally and Tyler fall in love, though the film thrusts a twist in its denouement.
“Remember Me” drips with melodrama. There is simply too much of the “poor rich boy” sentiment that reeks of a poorly executed homage to Salinger. At one point in the film, Aidan even accuses Tyler of being “nihilistic,” which is surprisingly accurate. The film’s “carpe diem” message is lost in its saturation of emotional fits and Tyler’s fixation on his brother’s suicide. Even the central theme is not entirely supported as the film’s resolution is ambiguous; Tyler is ultimately punished for his reconciliation with his father. This lack of clarity in a film that seemingly pushes so hard for it is frustrating and unfulfilling.
To be sure, there are unforgettable moments of poignancy in the film that punctuate its bathos. The opening sequence of Ally’s mother’s murder is particularly disturbing and salient; the camera directly looks into the barrel of the murderer’s gun, thereby allowing the spectator to vicariously anticipate the fatal shot. It is terrifying and horrific, ergo a clever and memorable way for Coulter to begin the film. Another heartbreaking shot is the pan across Lauren’s half-severed hair at a birthday party, the consequence of a pernicious schoolgirl prank. This trauma pierces through the narrative’s overall angst because of the sincerity of Lauren’s anguish. Both of these moments are acutely upsetting, though perhaps the most memorable and tear-jerking scene is the film’s last.
Pattinson plays a character not too different from the “Twilight” series’ Edward Cullen and shares the same trademarks—the bilious stare and the tossing of unkempt brunette locks. Though the vehement temper tantrums that Tyler throws might be out of character for Edward, the two share a dark, cool demeanor. Tyler is not immensely charming or sympathetic, and Pattinson’s acting is ultimately neither commendable nor totally deplorable. “Twilight” fans, though, will probably squeal with delight (or tremble with envy?) at Pattinson’s kissing and wet shirt scenes.
As for the other actors, Ravin is fresh and surprising. Her character is enchanting yet broken, and she manages to fully flesh out a believable performance. As an Irishman, Brosnan, however, fails to convince as a New Yorker, and his pseudo-New York accent is almost laughable. None of the performances—other than Ravine’s—are particularly outstanding, and it is disappointing to see such a lukewarm result from such a star-studded cast.
In the end, “Remember Me” doesn’t need its title to implore you to remember it; there are enough moments in the film that do it justice. Nevertheless, this is a film that is eventful but never gripping, emotional but rarely compelling. Though the Twi-hards will definitely catch it in theaters, for the rest the film-going audience, the twist at the end may or may not just be worth a matinee ticket.

It is not every biblical book that opens with God commanding his prophet to go marry a prostitute. But this is exactly what the prophet Hosea is told to do at the outset of his biblical career. “The Lord said to Hosea: ‘Go get yourself a wife of whoredom and children of whoredom; for the land will stray from the following of the Lord.’” Few readers of this story have ever taken it literally, especially given that in the ensuing fourteen chapters of the book, Hosea’s problematic marriage is used as an allegory for the relationship between God and the sinful Children of Israel. But consider, for a moment, if “Hosea” is not merely a metaphorical morality play, but rather did happen to a historical person, and a prophet of God no less. This prospect is essentially the premise of “The Prophet’s Wife.”
Attempting to flesh out the life of this peculiar prophet in a work of imaginative historical fiction is Milton Steinberg, formerly the rabbi of the Park Avenue Synagogue in New York City and a prolific author on Jewish thought. Much like its subject matter, the book is unusual. Though it was released to much fanfare this March, Steinberg died in 1950. “The Prophet’s Wife” is an unfinished manuscript, long preserved in boxes of papers and correspondence, and only now edited and presented to the public. The book has no ending, though not for lack of trying by numerous Jewish novelists—including Steinberg’s close friend, Herman Wouk—who were asked to provide one and failed. But at over 300 pages, “The Prophet’s Wife” doesn’t lack for thought-provoking content.
The title is something of a misnomer in that it doesn’t reflect which character the book actually follows. Though Steinberg gives his due to Gomer, the wayward wife of Hosea, the book takes place within the mind of Hosea himself. “The Prophet’s Wife” thus follows the prophet from a contemplative childhood, through his apprenticeship as a scribe, and into his troubled marriage and adulthood. Ironically, and most unfortunately, due to the book’s arrested development, the story never does get to Hosea’s actual prophetic career, aside from a brief glimpse afforded in the prologue.
In breathing literary life into Hosea, Steinberg asks several basic questions: What makes a person into a prophet? What character traits would one possess, and what sort of life would lead to such a calling? In Hosea’s case, the Bible is silent on his personal formation, allowing Steinberg a canvas upon which to freely project his own answers.
Like Steinberg’s only other work of fiction, “As a Driven Leaf”—in which he constructs a life for Elisha ben Abuyah, the Talmud’s own sage and heretic, out of short Talmudic stories about him and some healthy creative license—“The Prophet’s Wife” uses an intriguing traditional character as the starting point for a meditation on the religious experience. For the protagonist of “As a Driven Leaf,” the conundrum is whether faith is possible in a rational world. For Hosea in “The Prophet’s Wife,” the question is how to live that life of faith, once one has chosen it. In both books, Steinberg adeptly uses tradition to pose contemporary questions.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, this very modern novel has a fraught relationship with its ancient source material. On the one hand, the text of the story is rife with biblical allusions. Some are direct citations made by characters, some inform the book’s conversations in paraphrase, and still others are simply biblical phrases woven directly into the fabric of Steinberg’s narrative. The somewhat stilted wording of the Bible in English translation assimilates easily into Steinberg’s high register prose style, and in this manner, the milieu of the story pervades the storytelling.
Yet God does not speak in this retelling of the Bible. Hosea’s words and actions stem from his own personal inclinations. In the Bible, God orders him to marry Gomer; in Steinberg’s book, the marriage comes about naturally. Likewise, Steinberg’s Hosea preaches from experience, not divine ecstasy. This is the story as a modern writer—uncomfortable with the idea of a too personal God and drawn to a materialistic understanding of human affairs—would tell it. Thus, even as Steinberg draws upon the Bible for his inspiration, he distances himself from it. Through this lens, “The Prophet’s Wife” is one theologian’s attempt at rational rapprochement with the Bible, and in this case, the idea of inspired prophecy. It is a move from the original prophetic intonation of “thus spake the Lord” to “thus spake my heart.” There is a distinct tension between the old and the new.
It is rare today that a novel grapples with the several thousand years of Jewish history and heritage that preceded America, rather than only addressing the issues surrounding modern Jewish life. Mainstream Jewish authors such as Philip Roth or Jonathan Safran Foer are writing about Jews, but not so much about Judaism. Less common is the Chaim Potok or the Milton Steinberg who attempts to bring the vast Jewish past into dialogue with the Jewish present.
The singularity of Steinberg’s mode of writing helps explain the curious sight of many Jewish public and literary luminaries—Elie Wiesel, Cynthia Ozick and Harold Kushner among them—all suddenly seizing the coattails of this rather obscure rabbi now six decades deceased, and adorning “The Prophet’s Wife” with glowing blurbs, introductions and even back-of-the-book commentaries. If there is a lesson beyond the theological to be derived from “The Prophet’s Wife,” it is that this is a genre worth reviving. Steinberg never finished his book, but its publication reopens the door for others to write their own entries in his renewed tradition.

“Silk Parachute,” John McPhee’s latest anthology of essays, is already a relic. A slender addendum to McPhee’s two previous collections of personal essays and literary journalism, this book evokes a rapidly fading epoch in which compendia of previously published works (not to mention books in general) could still turn a profit. Indeed, “Silk Parachute” often feels as though it was rushed to press too quickly. The highlight of the book, “Spin Right and Shoot Left,” which examines the history and current state of lacrosse, was published in “The New Yorker” less than a year ago, and without the literal and intellectual heft of this piece, this anthology would be too slight to warrant the name.
This isn’t as much of a problem as it sounds; if these pieces are less ambitious than McPhee’s books, they succeed as especially substantial and elegant nonfiction. This collection provides an enticing introduction to a body of work that can be intimidating by virtue of its sheer volume and journalistic rigor.
The eponymous essay, “Silk Parachute,” opens the collection. Despite being McPhee’s most anthologized piece, it mainly excels at its style, and its content is not as intellectually rich or complex as the later pieces. It serves as an adequate introduction to the book and establishes an introspective tone that will stand out to readers more accustomed to McPhee’s journalistic mode.
Although it is pleasant to see a talented writer branch into new territory, exposition remains McPhee’s strength and thus his longer, more journalistic pieces are most rewarding. McPhee’s style is unique, but in a way that does not encroach upon the material. The worst narrative journalists are those that cannot overcome their fondness for their topics; the slightly better ones have trouble overcoming their fondness for their own voice. McPhee is able to avoid both of these pitfalls.
Compare the essays of “Silk Parachute” to those of McPhee’s “New Yorker” colleague, Malcolm Gladwell: although the writers share an interest in people, their processes are polar opposites. McPhee starts with a detailed discussion of a topic, be it “eccentric food” or Europe’s chalk country, and allows his topic to elucidate a truism about society with such finesse that it seems accidental. Rather than spend pages reveling in the significance of what he has found—like Gladwell—the most poignant insights are sown unassumingly amid expository passages, leaving the patient reader to experience the joy of discovery that McPhee must have felt during his research.
Because of this, McPhee’s journalism can be challenging. His writing has a crisp physicality and attention to detail: he is fond of lists, and he does not cut corners. It is easy to see how a younger writer, more enamored of punch and cleverness, might sigh at a passage like the following from “Under the Cloth;” “They cross the George Washington Bridge to New Jersey and go north on the Palisades Parkway to Rockefeller Lookout in Englewood Cliffs.” The cacophony of place names does nothing to move the essay along, and it might be argued that such attention to detail crosses the line into self-indulgence. However, this trademark specificity is what gives these pieces their grounding.
McPhee’s obsession with setting hints at the true significance of “Silk Parachute”: collected, these essays reveal not only a stunning attention to detail, but also the degree to which McPhee is steeped in the world in which he was raised—the intellectual scene of the American Northeast. When he writes that “Los Angeles might as well be Tokyo” in the East Coast-centered world of lacrosse, he could easily be talking about himself; his entire oeuvre could well be seen as an unsuccessful attempt to escape this cultural milieu. While he certainly managed to transcend the typical place and subject matter of the northeastern writer, he never quite shakes that intellectual sensibility, nor the envelope of privilege through which he perceives the worlds he describes.
But if champagne-making, nature photography and the U.S. Open are not the most daring of topics, McPhee deserves credit for writing about what he understands, and his depth of knowledge is unassailable. Moreover, he manages to tell very detailed stories without sacrificing any stylistic verve.
The most resonant piece in “Silk Parachute” can be easy to overlook. Near the end of the book, seemingly an afterthought to the fact-heavy pieces that precede it, “Checkpoints” explores the process of fact-checking at “The New Yorker.” The essay is a triumph of form, weaving together a broad swath of anecdotes and characters without feeling like what it is: a hodgepodge. But more importantly, it offers something unusual and valuable—a clean and frank description of the toil of writing about the world.
In “Checkpoints,” McPhee good-naturedly summarizes the unglamorous aspects of journalism: the deliberations about comma placement, the silly follow-up interviews, the tension between writer, editor, fact-checker and subject. It’s enough to deter many who, after the quiet delights of the preceding essays, might understandably wish to quit their day jobs and write for “The New Yorker.” But while it certainly obliterates any illusions that McPhee’s job is an easy one, it is also an affirmation of why his essays are worthwhile, both for the writer and the reader. Each piece demonstrates exceptional command of style and tells a penetrating story, and while the topics are occasionally obscure, they never feel unimportant.

John Banville is a calculating craftsman. The Irish novelist’s 1998 “The Book of Evidence” was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize and his 2005 novel “The Sea” won it. Critics have compared his dreamy, playful writing to that of Vladimir Nabokov and Virginia Woolf; Don DeLillo praised his work as “dangerous and clear-running.”
So if “The Infinities,” his twentieth novel, is somewhat disappointing, it should come as no surprise that Banville still chose the perfect title to describe his work. In this book, Banville smoothly brings together unbounded ideas and weaves them in mind-bending ways, much like a mathematician might with grand mathematical concepts. He opens new worlds and twists truths (if infinity encompasses everything, there can’t be more than one), but painted with such a broad brush, Banville’s novel comes across more theoretical than credible—an illusory exploration of reality and family too lofty to be moving.
The plot’s premise is fairly simple: Adam Godley, world-renowned Irish mathematician, is dying and his family has assembled at his country home to watch him go. It is no coincidence that Banville uses the name of Shakespeare’s magical forest for Godley’s estate—Arden— and the plot itself is soon complicated by the presence of the supernatural: Hermes, the Greek messenger of the gods, watches and narrates as the awfully-named Godleys eat, drink and live their mortal lives. Other gods also enjoy the human spectacle and occasionally intervene. As Adam lies immobile on his bed, Zeus seduces his daughter-in-law, Helena, disguised as her husband, also named Adam; the trickster god Pan meddles with the household as well.
On a structural level, this setup recalls the myth of Amphytryon, in which Zeus cuckolds an unsuspecting general by taking on his form. References to the myth run through the book—Helena is to play Amphytryon’s wife in an upcoming play and carries a ring with the character’s initial. This parallel story line adds texture to the book’s simple premise. As the Godley family flits and bickers, the gods too flirt with drama. “Oh, Dad,” Hermes frequently exclaims at Zeus’s escapades.
The unfolding plot becomes more and more complex. Godley’s mathematical work deals with parallel universes—and it turns out that the entire book takes place in one. Sweden, we learn, is always on the warpath; Godley’s own fame comes from his success in cold fusion, a process which only works in his world. One begins to wonder at the potential truth of the grandiose statements that Adam turns over while lying in a coma. “My equations spanned a multitude of universes yet they posited a single world of unity and ultimate order,” he recalls.
Banville has said that he wishes to give prose, “the kind of denseness and thickness poetry has.” Practically, this wish causes him to write in long, flowery sentences. He opens his novel with ornate description: “Of the things we fashioned for them that they might be comforted, dawn is the one that works. When darkness sifts from the air like fine soft soot and light spreads slowly out of the east then all but the most wretched of humankind rally.” His soft rhythm and languid flow serve to uphold a hazy atmosphere throughout.
Other stylistic choices work less well. Banville frequently expresses emotion through repetition and rhetorical questions, and the forcefulness soon gets tiresome. “But I ask—am I haughty? Do I bridle? A little, I suppose. A little,” reads one of Hermes’ interior monologues. Banville’s moves are well-considered—minds, after all, are noisy places—but it seems unlikely that his characters would really end all their thoughts with vigorous punctuation.
This choice especially hinders the female characters of the book. Where Adam Godley’s thoughts, even in his coma, develop with nuance, the women of the book come across one-sided. Petra, Adam’s melancholy daughter, spends much of the book defined by her stone-like name; her mother rarely acts unless to pour herself a drink. This may be a reflection of the confined place of women within the Godley household. Women, it seems, didn’t have much place in Adam’s math-filled mind. “One I drove to drown herself, the other I drove to drink,” Adam recalls of his wives. But even as such, Banville’s portrayals of his female characters feel flimsy, and almost lazy.
Such unconvincing renderings of human life permeate the book, and they ultimately thwart Banville’s loftier ideas. Where Banville’s concept of parallel universes is enticing, his portrayal of more-grounded daily actions are unsubstantial to the point where one wonders if one should trust him at all. Banville paints the heavenly realm with ease, but he describes sex as “a repeated toing and froing on the edge of a precipice beyond which can be glimpsed a dark-green distance in a reeking mist and something shining out at them, a pulsing point of light, peremptory and intense.” Without a strong foundation in the human realm, Banville’s more conceptual ideas don’t stick.

Based on the best-selling Swedish crime novel by Stieg Larsson, “The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo” has finally hit American theaters and has hit the ground running.
Following its initial release in Sweden last year, the film claimed three Guldbagge Awards (awarded by the Swedish Film Institute), including Best Actress and Best Film, and three other nominations in the European Film Awards and Amanda Awards in Norway.
Without a trace, sixteen-year-old Harriet Vanger vanishes from the island that houses her influential family. Her disappearance continues to haunt her family for forty years, so an old and distraught Henrik Vanger (Sven-Bertil Taube) calls the once-renowned journalist, Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nygvist), to investigate the decades-old mystery.
As he searches for the truth, he meets Lisbeth Salamander (Noomi Rapace), a dangerous girl that has been hacking into his computer since the day he lost a libel trial. The two team-up to solve the mystery surrounding the secretive Vanger family, and their combined efforts eventually lead them to the unsolved crimes of a serial killer.
From a formal standpoint, the film is a resounding success. The cinematography is beautiful—every scene is unsettlingly real, striking a balance between the familiar and the frightening. The lighting is appropriately stark, inspiring shadows of doubt concerning the characters’ suspicions, motivations, and secrets. The accompanying score by Jacob Grost is so in tune with the film that it alone could chill a listener to the bone.
Moreover, the focus on strong character development also seems to be the key to the film’s overall success, as it allows for some incredible performances. Rapace shines through in a performance that is brutal to watch and torturous to think about.
Her mysterious, violent, loner persona could easily get lost had the film solely focused on the twisting plot, and that is not a risk worth taking. It is her odd-girl approach that keeps the movie rolling and keeps the mystery unraveling.
The titlular character keeps the movie at a gratifying edge-of-your-seat intensity, to the point where her violently tattooing “I’m a sadist pig and a rapist,” across her guardian’s chest is satisfying.
In fact, every facet of this story touches a nerve. “The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo” dabbles with the horrors of mental instability, broken families, rape, religious fanaticism, and racism. And while the tale is fictional, it attempts to shed light on societal issues in Sweden that are often overlooked: violence against women, capitalist corruption, and anti-Semitism.
The film is not, however, completely flawless. At times, the movie  focuses so keenly on character development that it detracts somewhat from the story line. This development is essential to discerning why Lisbeth and Blomkvist, two extremely lost people, make the kind of desperate and dangerous decisions that they do. Larsson’s story is more eloquently written than the pared script. This ultimately is no fault of the movie, however, as that kind of story-telling simply cannot be delivered without several more hours of film.
The twisted tragedy of the morally bankrupt Vanger dynasty, a fallen and disgraced journalist, and a girl who has experienced every horror one could imagine is deeply engaging. Despite the slightly lacking plot development, “The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo” is a near triumph.

Although moving at times, “The Yellow Handkerchief” doesn’t ever quite do its soothing driving montages justice. This certainly speaks against the film, but it should be noted that the aforementioned montages are truly excellent, with Eef Barzelay’s thoughtful soundtrack adding color to beautifully serene, eerie shots of the protagonists barreling along forsaken southern roads in a faded blue convertible. These scenes provide the viewer with brief respites from the occasionally awkward tension of the film’s plot, which focuses on three loners who end up in the same car on a trip through Louisiana. Despite this awkwardness, the tension usually feels genuine, highlighting the honesty of the film’s love story.
In the first scene of “The Yellow Handkerchief,” the viewer is introduced to Brett Hanson (William Hurt), a middle-aged oilrig worker affecting a rougher Dr. Phil, recently released from prison and heading to the local convenience store for a beer. A minute or two later, he meets up with a heartbroken young woman (Kristen Stewart of “Twilight” fame) and an odd, lanky teenage boy from California (Eddie Redmayne) who is pursuing her. Chance unites the three in a single car crossing a river by ferry, and when the ferry’s return trip is cancelled due to a storm, they decide to drive on. Scenes of their road trip south are then interspersed with short flashbacks showing Brett romantically involved with a woman of around his age (Maria Bello).
These flashbacks are pretty obscure at first, but it’s easy to guess that they’ll eventually reveal why Brett was in jail. Knowing little about the movie’s characters that could render their aimless excursion very gripping, this curiosity regarding Brett’s past is about the only thing driving the plot forward at times. There’s no immediate answer among the flashbacks, though a love story begins to unfold in there, eventually emerging as the foremost narrative element of the film.
Although the bulk of the film’s character development occurs in these flashbacks, this love story, along with a second that emerges in the narrative foreground between the other strangers, is fairly well done. Both of these relationships range from extremely endearing at moments to nearly despicable at others, but this often makes them seem more realistic. Neither avoids predictability though, often as a result of the characters’ stereotypical natures; the beautiful young woman first thinks she’s too good for the strange Californian but later reconsiders upon seeing his more tender side. His tender side, by the way, is revealed to her through a photo diary he makes as a “science project” so researchers might later be able to “study abnormality first hand.” It can get a bit corny.
The truly redeeming aspect of this film is its cinematography. The film’s plot does not move too quickly, which allows for a lot of visual development—the beautiful, washed out scenes of a southern road trip really feel that way. The group’s random stops at deserted houses, churches, and gas stations are all very visually appealing. The visual style also gives the film a certain voyeuristic feel, which is enhanced by the limited character development—they all talk about their actions, and eventually Brett actually tells the others the full story which has been hinted at in the flashbacks, yet no one’s thoughts or motivations are ever revealed firsthand.
Though the film can be hokey at times, its strong visual appeal and soundtrack, paired with the honesty of the character interactions, prevent “The Yellow Handkerchief” from sliding into mediocrity.

“She’s Out of My League” opens with a close-up of Kirk Kettner’s (Jay Baruchel) face as he delivers a well-rehearsed speech to try to get his girlfriend back. As he speaks, the camera pans out to reveal a beautiful backdrop of a green meadow surrounded by trees, adding a certain amount of potence to Kirk’s otherwise pathetic speech. However, as the camera continues to pull back, it becomes evident that Kirk is not in some idyllic mountain location, but is instead simply sitting in front of a billboard at an airport.
Just as the camera reveals that Kirk is sitting on a cheap lawn-chair and not a log or a bench, a plane roars overhead, bringing home the point that this movie is not afraid of trading in subtlety for loud, obvious humor. In fact, the opening scene couldn’t fit the film itself more perfectly. Like Kirk’s billboard, the film sets audiences up for a promising scene, then pulls back to reveal the seams.
The premise of “She’s Out of My League” is an interesting one: a slight variation on the typical boy-meets-girl romantic comedy. But the plotline is a dud, selling out in the end for the formulaic happy ending everyone has seen before.
As the title suggests, the movie follows the underachieving, scrawny, self-conscious Kirk as he dates Molly (Alice Eve) who is everything he is not: successful, beautiful, and confident. Kirk skipped college; Molly has a law degree. Kirk comes from a working-class family; Molly’s background is more affluent.
Yet, for some reason Kirk and his friends cannot figure out, Molly likes him. She asks him on several dates, but neither he nor his friends believe that she could be romantically interested in him. Not even her ex-boyfriend, handsome hockey star Cam (Geoff Stults), even considers the possibility that Kirk is a competitor—he even confuses Kirk for a waiter when he runs into Molly and Kirk at a restaurant. Kirk’s self-confidence issues lead him to drive her away, but not before subjecting himself (and the audience) to a series of almost unbearably awkward situations.
As evident in the first scene, the film works well with its setting, using location to spark ironically amusing dialogue. The airport, where Kirk works as a TSA agent along with his friends, provides a humorous backdrop for their conversations about Kirk’s relationship with Molly; instead of moving the lines through his security check, as a TSA agent, Kirk spends much of his time at work chatting—offering an explanation as to why airport security lines are so long. In another scene, Kirk and his friends go around on an empty baggage carousel as they discuss Kirk’s latest mistake with Molly. The irony of these settings—strange for a heart-felt tête-à-tête—is enjoyable.
The supporting cast also provides humorous lines from time to time, especially Devon, played by Nate Torrence, who supplies the group of Kirk’s friends with naïve, child-like interjections which are so wrong for the situation that one can’t help but laugh. Molly’s friend Patty, played by Krysten Ritter, and Kirk’s friend Stainer (T.J. Miller) also have several comedic—albeit tense—stretches of dialogue.
For the most part, however, the movie is more uncomfortable than funny, though perhaps not in the way that the filmmakers intended. Cringing feels more appropriate than laughing when Kirk makes a fool of himself in front of Molly’s parents, or when he allows Devon to shave his testicles. The entire film circles around this urge to thrust Kirk into as many awkward situations as possible—which is funny at times, but mostly falls flat. With this goal at its center, the film lacks a cohesiveness which makes the ending seem rather like a hasty attempt to tie things together.
Overall, “She’s Out of My League” makes an admirable—if inconsistent—stab at an off-beat variation on the tired romantic comedy template.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Alice Eve and Krysten Ritter are two very busy women. Promoting their upcoming romantic comedy, “She’s Out of My League,” they have been making a whirlwind tour of America, stopping in Boston in late February to screen the movie and orchestrate some publicity.
The film tells the story of a geeky, goofy airport security guard named Kirk (Jay Baruchel) who meets and ends up dating a drop-dead gorgeous party-planner (Eve) who comes through his airport. Everyone around them tells them that it can’t work, because while Kirk is a “5” on the hotness-scale, Molly is a “10,” and two people of such diverging attractiveness could never make it work. Ritter plays Eve’s straight-talking, hostile best friend who is opposed to the relationship from the beginning.
Both Eve and Ritter are relatively seasoned at the entertainment gig. While Eve comes from a family of actors, Ritter was discovered in her teens at a mall. Most recently, Ritter has been in “Confessions of a Shopaholic” and “27 Dresses” but for Eve, this is one of her first major releases.
“This is the biggest promotional tour that we’ve done. It’s pretty full-on,” said Eve. “We get up really early in the morning, and we do the radio shows, whatever city we’re in. And then we do some TV, we do some stuff like this, and then we go, get on a plane and fly to the next city. We’ll go to a screening, do a Q&A, and then we have about three and a half, four hours off to sleep and start again.”
Both women also have a strong background in television. Ritter has been on several cable dramas including “Woke Up Dead” and “Breaking Bad.” Eve also started out acting in television.
“I think there is great material and great creative voices on cable television,” remarked Ritter. “Things can be true to what they start out as. ”
In keeping with the theme of the movie, Eve and Ritter have had to assign numerical values on the attraction-scale to fans left and right for the majority of the tour. “We’ve been doing it all day, every day, for our tour,” said Ritter. “People will be like, ‘Rate this guy!’”
“They make us rate people either as tens or ones and that’s it,” Ritter complained.
After the Boston screening, Ritter and Eve were asked to rate three fans randomly pulled from the audience. The one assigned the highest score by the girls would win a date with a Boston University cheerleader.
However, in the case of the Boston screening, the girls found a way around the strict number system. Even though they had to assign one of the boys a ‘1,’ they protested when he was deemed the loser. With a little bit of cajoling and some well-placed audience chants, they managed to score dates for all of the boys.
“We don’t like rating people. We didn’t believe any of them were like numbers. It’s just we have to do it,” said Eve. “But some people are a ten in the morning and a one in the evening, you know what I mean? Like, Jesus—we’re human, it changes!”
When asked if they’ve ever dated someone out of their league, both women—ever humble—immediately claimed that their significant others were hotter than they were.
“I’m dating someone who’s out of my league... Well, I don’t know. I think he’s better looking than I am, but, I’m a good time,” replied Ritter.
“I don’t know; I think you’re reaching but I think he’s reaching harder” Eve quipped.

It’s easy to assume that the relatively small, non-degree dance program at Harvard could never rival a professional dance company in prestige or caliber. But as the Harvard Dance Program’s upcoming recital, The Dancers’ Viewpointe 10, proves, the program actually provides some of its student dancers with opportunities of which many professionals only dream. The performance, which will run in the New College Theatre from March 26 to April 3, features an impressive repertoire by two of the dance world’s most acclaimed choreographers as well as members of Harvard faculty.
The main highlight of Viewpointe 10 will be a medley of works by Alvin Ailey, one of the twentieth century’s eminent ballet choreographers. According to Harvard assistant dance director Kristen I. Aune, the medley will feature works from all different points in Ailey’s career. Many of these choreographies are rarely performed, and they were hand-selected for Harvard dancers by Sylvia Waters of the Alvin Ailey Dance Company (AADC), Aune says.
“These pieces beautifully showcase our dancers’ talent,” she says. “And together, they’re truly representative of Ailey’s work.”
James C. Fuller ’10, one of the students dancing in the medley, says he is grateful for the chance to perform these rarely-staged Ailey pieces.
“Doing the work of Alvin Ailey has really made me a stronger dancer,” Fuller says. “The medley features a wide range of choreography, and all the pieces have different dynamics. It’s going to be very physical and energetic.”
Additionally, Demetia Hopkins and Tyrone Walker, two professional dancers from AADC’s younger company, Ailey II, will be performing alongside student dancers in the show.
Equally impressive, Viewpointe 10 also features the premiere of a new duet by the legendary Trey McIntyre, which was choreographed specifically for Harvard students.
Merritt A. Moore ’11, one of the dancers in this duet, flew to Boise, Idaho earlier this year to work with McIntyre. She says of her experience with the famed choreographer, “This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Even for professionals in the best dance companies, to have a top choreographer create a solo for you is so rare, and it’s been phenomenal.”
McIntyre had worked with other Harvard students in the past and, according to Aune, he was so impressed by their intelligence and professionalism that he took some time from running his own company, The Trey McIntyre Project, to create a brand-new piece for Moore and her partner in the duet, Kevin Shee ’11.
“[The piece is a] daring work of contemporary ballet featuring very organic, truthful movement. It definitely forces you to explore outside of the box and makes you feel vulnerable, but it’s so much more rewarding that way,” Moore says.
Also on the concert’s program are works by two members of the Harvard Dance Program’s own faculty. Harvard Dance Director Elizabeth W. Bergmann has re-staged her quartet “They Say We Travel the Same Road” for student dancers to perform in the upcoming production. Bergmann, a Julliard graduate who initiated the Viewpointe series ten years ago, said of the all-women ensemble: “[The piece] is about the idea that in life, while we may sometimes fight with the people around us, we ultimately support each other because we all travel the same road... It’s one of my stronger pieces, and it’s great to bring it back.”
Harvard jazz teacher Jodi L. Allen will also be presenting her own piece, entitled “Breathe.” According to Bergmann, Allen’s choreography is sure to be “a really physical, exciting addition to the Viewpointe show.”
As Aune expressed, Viewpointe 10 should give Harvard dance more visibility at the University. “The dance program at Harvard may be under the radar, simply because the Ivy League is known for doing other things,” Aune admits.
But with shows like this year’s Viewpointe, she adds that the program has a real chance to demonstrate its professional repertoire and veritable artistic achievements.
And in preparation for her roles in both the Ailey Medley and the McIntyre piece, Moore expressed a similar sentiment about the quality of Harvard’s dance program at large.
“The opportunities we’ve been fortunate enough to have are amazing. I just can’t get enough,” she says.

March 25-27
Loeb Experimental Theater
Directed by Jan Luksic ’11
Produced by Jan Luksic ’11 and Sonia C. Coman ’11
For those who strive for excellence, especially at an institution as competitive as Harvard, the fear of mediocrity looms.  This fear is at the center of the student-written play “Leah.” Grappling with questions of personal destiny, excellence, and regret, the production chronicles the misadventures of an ill-fated young woman trying desperately to be exceptional.
“But that’s just the starting point,” director Jan Luksic ’11 says. “The show itself is about the regrets of Leah. She’s just really deprived of something that she thinks she can get.”
Written by Sonia C. Coman ’11, the play is an absurdist drama that follows the life of Leah, the Old Testament character and first wife of Jacob, who lives life haunted by the possibility of being just average. Over the course of the show she struggles with her destiny by reliving important moments in her life. As she reflects on her past, Leah meets old versions of herself and watches them make the decisions that have brought her to where she is.
Originally inspired by the one-dimensional portrayal of the biblical lead, the play was first drafted while Coman was in high school in Romania.
“I was reading this passage about Leah [in the Bible]... and all of the sudden from outside I heard the sound of a circus van announcing the circus very loudly, and there was something in that juxtaposition that made me rethink what I was reading,” she says.
When asked about the moles that seem omnipresent in the show’s promotional material, Coman laughs and gestures to the giant papier-mâché mole she is in the middle of creating.
“The moles are a metaphor for mediocrity,” she says. “The idea was that moles have this underground life... although they don’t have a prescriptive path, they always know their way around, and this is a metaphor for people who choose the easy trajectory in life. Leah does not want to follow that path. She wants to do what she can do best, and that’s not easy.”

I am overprotective of the television shows I like, especially when it’s clear from their low production values and offbeat humor that they’re not their network’s biggest priority. Over the last six months, I’ve grown very fond of ABC’s “Modern Family.” So, when advertisements for NBC’s “Parenthood” began to saturate commercial breaks in February, I took it personally.
TV shows about families are easy to love, and hard to fall in love with. It’s not like the experience of watching a cop show, when we’re relatively willing to accept that it’s perfectly common for detectives to start shooting at people with little to no provocation—and, of course, never to fill out any paperwork.
We all have families and therefore specific ideas of how they talk, how they fight, how they sound and look. It’s not surprising, then, that we each have equally specific ideas of what we want from family shows: think of the different itches scratched by “Seventh Heaven,” “Tyler Perry’s House of Payne,” and “Arrested Development.”
But what, if any, is the difference between “Modern Family” and “Parenthood?” After all, you only need to watch a single ad for each to know that their fundamental plot similarity is striking: both series follow multiple generations of one family.
In fact, “Parenthood” would have premiered on the same night as “Modern Family”—September 23 of last year—if actress Maura Tierney’s breast cancer diagnosis hadn’t delayed its debut until March 2. Ed O’Neill and Craig T. Nelson, the shows’ respective patriarchs, even vaguely resemble one another. However, by straining to be emotionally hard-hitting, “Parenthood” falls flat.
The hour-long dramedy—executive produced by Ron Howard, who also worked on the aforementioned, ever-hallowed “Arrested Development”—is based on the eponymous 1989 film, directed by Howard and starring Steve Martin. This is NBC’s second attempt to adapt the movie for television.
The 1990 series, starring Ed Begley Jr. and Leonardo DiCaprio, lasted for only one season.
Unfortunately, the show’s problem is that it seems exactly as if it was adapted from a 20-year-old movie. From the father who engages in a heated argument with a Little League umpire to the girlfriend who wants a baby sooner than her boyfriend does, there’s a lot here that we’ve seen before, and more than once.
“Parenthood” is aware of its tropes, and clumsily tries to keep them fresh by adding a heavy-handed twist of “contemporary” complexity. Did I mention that the baseball-playing son may have Asperger Syndrome, and the unwilling boyfriend will soon discover he has a multiracial son with an ex-girlfriend?
By comparison, “Modern Family,” still isn’t wildly nontraditional, at least in terms of format. It’s by no means pitch-perfect—but it’s good, and solidly good.
“Modern Family” is a twenty-two minute mockumentary-style sitcom that follows three arms of the same family. There’s Jay (Ed O’Neill), remarried to a much younger Colombian beauty, Gloria (Sofía Vergara), with a sensitive preteen son; his daughter Claire (Julie Bowen), a stay-at-home mom with three kids and a well-meaning man-child husband, Phil (Ty Burrell); and his son Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson), a gay man who has just adopted a Vietnamese baby with his partner Cameron (Eric Stonestreet).
Phil and Cameron are, by leaps and bounds, the best parts of the show. Imagine Cameron, a large man in an elaborate clown costume and makeup, physically threatening the gas station bully who insulted Mitchell, or Phil gleefully joining his 10-year-old son for a treasure-hunting expedition under the house. It’s hardly standard sitcom fare—and, therefore, much funnier as the reheated material you’d expect to find on “Parenthood.”
In one sense, it’s an easier task for a quirky half-hour comedy like “Modern Family” to fulfill its potential than for “Parenthood,” a longer and more dramatic program with lofty ambitions.
And it’s important to note that “Parenthood” is a well-made show. I’d have to say that, in spite of its flaws, I really like it. The subplots are consistent (if unoriginal), the dialogue is snappy, and the show is downright cinematic in terms of visual appeal—the family’s Berkeley, California home slaps a relaxed hippie veneer on Nancy Meyers upper-middle-class opulence.
But it lacks the genius of “Modern Family,” which takes family problems for granted and decides that we’re ready to laugh at them.
“Parenthood” doesn’t allow its viewers this measure of maturity. Instead, it showcases single parenting and sibling rivalries as if it were the first time they had ever been broadcast on television.
It’s hard to shake the feeling that the show’s writers sat down and assembled a checklist of all the modern problems and controversies they could think of. The only thing “Parenthood” is missing is an openly gay character, which leads me to expect we’ll witness a dramatic uncloseting before season’s end.

Welsh National Opera’s (WNO) production of Richard Strauss and Hugo von Hofmannsthal’s “Ariadne auf Naxos” ran at the Boston Lyric Opera (BLO) from March 12-23 in its North American premiere. The production was worth shipping across the Atlantic. Funny and well-acted, it wryly reimagines Strauss’s and Hofmannsthal’s dialogue between the comic and the serious as a commentary on the state of contemporary opera—simultaneously providing an impressive showcase for virtuoso singing.
“Ariadne” lends itself easily to multiple layers of self-reference and interpretation. It consists of a Prologue and an Opera, the first framing the second. In the Prologue, a prodigiously young Composer (mezzo-soprano Edyta Kulczak) is about to see his first opera, the very serious “Ariadne auf Naxos,” performed at the court of a Viennese nobleman. However, at the nobleman’s behest, the order is given for the new opera to be combined with a troop of harlequins also slated to perform that evening. The second act, the Opera proper, presents the resulting blend.
With irreverent glee, the WNO production transforms the “harlequins” of the original opera into a sort of rock band, dressed up in leather, tour T-shirts, and faded jeans. The Composer and his cadre become manifestations of the typical “classical establishment”: all ties, fine clothing and preening. They stick faithfully to Strauss’s score—no insertions of guitars or anything like that—but the context makes it clear that they’re talking less about the relationship between the comic and the serious and more about that between the “popular” and the “classical.” The conceit plays out well, especially as the Composer falls in love with the leader of the troupe, Zerbinetta (the soprano Rachele Gilmore). Their duet, “Ein Augenblick ist wenig, ein Blick ist viel” (“A Moment is Nothing, But a Glance is Everything”), let the tremendous youthful zest of both characters flower. Bursting with energy and grace, the singing was entrancingly light but full-voiced. The Composer’s resistance to the idea of combining the opera with the clown act slackens just long enough to agree to the fusion of the two—a decision he immediately regrets.
The second act consists of the opera proper, the Composer’s “Ariadne auf Naxos.” The audience in the opera house implicitly becomes the audience in the house of the nobleman. The popular/classical concept of the Prologue seems to get dropped in the Opera; the harlequins stop being band members and become, somewhat disappointingly, actual harlequins (although one does wear sunglasses). The Opera itself could be substituted in any other production of “Ariadne auf Naxos” without much loss of continuity.
But the Opera works well enough on its own, which actually might in the end be healthier than forcing a particular production vision beyond its natural limits. Marjorie Owens’s stately, poised Ariadne provides a well-measured foil to Gilmore’s sprightly, impish Zerbinetta. The opera is, in effect, a showcase for the two very different types of sopranos—dramatic and coloratura—and each takes full advantage of the opportunity to have fun. Owens’s sturdy, firmly rooted rendition of the aria “Es gibt ein Reich” (“There is a Kingdom”) bolsters a part of the opera-within-an-opera that can tend to drag (which, to be fair, might simply have been the result of Strauss emulating the less-skilled idiom of a younger composer). It punches the same heights that Gilmore’s “Noch glaub’ ich dem einen ganz mich gehörend” (“I Still Believe I Belong to Someone”) does, by dancing around with ever more frenetic, outlandish stretches of virtuosity, the vocal equivalent of Dr. Seuss-like whimsy. She’s a delight just to watch, and even someone who never listens to classical vocal music couldn’t help but be amazed by the fact that a single human being can produce these sounds on her own.
The BLO, like all classical music institutions, is trying hard to find ways to engage new audiences, and particularly young audiences. Part of the allure of a lively, fun production like the WNO “Ariadne” is its ability to introduce opera to casual or first-time listeners without condescension or elitism.

If you want every idea you have about Lady Gaga to be challenged, watch her video for “Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say).” Though this 2009 single was never released in America, its video shows that the crazy party girl we know from “Bad Romance” actually has a weirdly girlish, domestic side. She also has a taste for fairly horrifying fake tan, but that’s beside the point. Somehow, in recent months Gaga seems to have forgotten everything normal about her, always pushing to be crazier than she has ever been before.
The latest product of Gaga’s shift in the craziness spectrum is the video for “Telephone,” which succeeds in surpassing even the imagery- and blood-strewn performance from the MTV Video Music Awards as the pinnacle of her avant-garde weirdness. There are sunglasses covered in cigarettes, poisoned honey, Quentin Tarantino references galore, and a scene where Gaga wears nothing but caution tape. This last feature seems a little unnecessary since, when someone is only wearing tape, most people will already have realized that she should probably be handled with caution.
“Telephone” is nine and a half minutes long, and every one of those minutes is packed with a healthy dose of good old-fashioned crazy. Though it’s meant to be a sequel to the “Paparazzi” video, “Telephone” feels more like a break from that phase of Gaga’s career than a continuation of it. No longer do songs need to play contiguously, videos don’t have to relate in any way to their song’s subject matter, and product placement can be as deliberately unsubtle as Gaga’s numerous outfits. At times it all gets a little too ridiculous (twinkie-sharing scene in the pussy wagon = awkward), and it’s still hard to tell why featured artist Beyoncé feels like she lives “in Grand Central Station,” but  Ms. Knowles’s acting chops and director Jonas Akerlund’s superb attention to detail help make it all thoroughly captivating.
Oh, and the video also gets around to dealing with that famous question of Gaga doubters—“I told you she didn’t have a dick,” says the prison officer who has just had Gaga’s distinctly female genitals shoved in her face. While Lady Gaga may not have a dick, as “Telephone” yet again shows, you can’t say she doesn’t have balls.

In the first scene of director Emmett Malloy’s White Stripes documentary, “Under Great White Northern Lights,” a confused fan stumbles up to the camera and asks, “Where’s the show, guys?” For a film about one of the most perplexingly idiosyncratic, mannered, and sincere bands going, this question perfectly summarizes the sentiments of the audience as they sit through 93 minutes of tour footage where the band members never quite reveal the pretense—or if there even is a pretense—behind their show of weirdness. Unfortunately, despite its musical strength, “Under Great White Northern Lights” provides little response to the fan’s question, opting instead for an unfocused, superficial look at the White Stripes.
No one but Jack White—who spends most of the film smiling like a satanic Cheshire cat—could dress mostly in red jump suits and walk around surrounded by bowler-hat-wearing, bag-pipe-playing roadies without seeming obviously fake. The Stripes’ utter commitment to their art is evident throughout the musical component of the documentary, where the White Stripes put on a series of impassioned concerts in diverse and bizarre venues. Jack and Meg begin each show, after brief bag pipe introductions, by marching straight onto stage (or lane, in the case of a concert at a bowling alley), picking up their instruments and playing without preplanned tempos or set lists. In one scene, the band takes the stage only to play one note before walking off. In another, they trade songs with Inuit elders, who nod off in time to the blues stylings of Jack. Throughout the film, the Stripes blaze through their 10-year catalogue, now rife with hits, accelerating and decelerating throughout every song and playing with an unhinged passion worthy of any classic rock or punk greats. The audio, also available in CD release, does an excellent, earsplitting job of capturing the fractured intensity of a White Stripes live show.
The film, however, does little more than present clips of these shows in relatively unexciting footage. Much of the film is shot in black and white, a treatment completely contrary to the White Stripes’ fervent belief that their music is spontaneous and immediate—not emulative and rooted in the past.  Additionally, the black and white filter seems like a post-production effect added to produce some sense of feigned authenticity. This, too, is completely contrary to the White Stripes’ own recording methods, which involve tape-recording with little to no post-production work. There exists a much-admired White Stripes aesthetic and style, and this film doesn’t capture it.
The best portions of the film are the impromptu gigs the Stripes play in out-of-the-way venues like buses, bowling alleys and elderly homes. Nothing suits the White Stripes’ spontaneity better than a surprise show, and these concerts are the most unique part of the tour. However, they receive less screen time than the stage shows, which, while aurally impressive, are not nearly as engaging in terms of narrative and filmmaking as their off-stage counterparts.
This lack of narrative focus is reflected in the film’s lack of an overarching conceptual theme. While Malloy flirts with several, his inability to construct one comprehensive thesis leaves the film unfulfilling and incoherent. Early on, it’s a straight-ahead concert film. Then, it’s a tribute to the band’s oddball stage mannerisms. Then, it begins to explore the intricate and fascinating relationship between Meg and Jack. One revelatory glimpse of the two, in which a sheepish Jack consoles Meg after driving her to tears with a piano ballad, suggests that this relationship is worthy of an entire film’s worth of material. This thread is abandoned, however, for nostalgic coverage of the White Stripes 10th anniversary concert, complete with a cheesy black-and-white freeze-frame of Jack and Meg waltzing at the end of the show. Any of these threads, if fully pursued, could have made an interesting movie, but Malloy’s attempt to encompass all of them results in a fractured and meaningless film, no more enjoyable than a series of White Stripes YouTube clips watched consecutively.
While the film serves as a reminder of how eccentrially vital the White Stripes are, it adds nothing new or unheard to their mythology. In one scene, Jack White addresses the accusation that everything about the band is contrived, saying, “People say it’s all premeditated, but it was premeditated 10 years ago.” In the intervening 10 years, nothing about the White Stripes’ premeditated style has changed. The film fails to prove its significance, coming off as more of a limp reminder than a revelatory take on the utterly fascinating world of the White Stripes.

If The Dillinger Escape Plan (TDEP) aren’t suffering from a florid case of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, they’re certainly playing the part well. Take “Farewell, Mona Lisa,” the lead single off the band’s fourth album, “Option Paralysis:” just as the song’s grindcore rendition of dial-up modem noise grows exhausting, the band breaks into a cascade of eerie acoustic guitar arpeggios. Then, after about 50 seconds of tranquility, they unleash a blinding squall of guitar riffage, while vocalist Greg Puciato changes his vocal style on almost a line-by-line basis.
TDEP have been around for almost 14 years—a minor miracle given the relentless energy their music demands. They play mathcore, a punk-metal hybrid that demands two things of its musicians: world-class time-keeping ability, and the belief that repeating a riff is risking stagnation. Not surprisingly, TDEP are virtuosi whose ability to maneuver odd time signatures at harrowing speeds is nonpareil. However, bands that work within a genre as schizophrenic as mathcore must be more than top-notch musicians. They must also be tasteful—too many blasts of guitar noise, time signature changes, abrupt genre switches, and monotonous shrieks, and the listeners may go running for their parents’ Simon and Garfunkel records. Thankfully, however, TDEP demonstrate such a tight command of their craft that “Option Paralysis” manages to be a captivating, and at times sublime listen.
Helping the band’s cause is a set of compelling performances from vocalist Puciato, who possesses a legion of voices. Sometimes, he sounds like Trent Reznor at his most pathetic, at others, like Living Colour’s Corey Glover at his most electric. Puciato’s unmelodic side has variety too—he yells, he whines, he screams, and he screeches. Either by luck or good taste, Puciato manages to avoid indulging in the atavistic grunting of death metal.
One need only listen to the band’s 1999 debut, “Calculating Infinity,” which was released before Puciato joined the group, to explore what TDEP would sound like without Puciato. Despite the occasional jazz guitar break, that genre classic is too relentless to invite end-to-end listens. Puciato’s versatility ensures that there’s no such problem with “Option Paralysis.” His diverse vocal styles encourage repeat listens in an attempt to discern the subtle differences.
Another important implication of Puciato’s presence is that TDEP have to write melodic, restrained music to accommodate him—it’s impolite to abuse your instrument’s noise-making ability while your vocalist is trying to sing. And as the album’s second single “Chinese Whispers” shows, they’ve become quite adept at integrating melody into mathcore. Throughout the track, TDEP use mellow breaks to release the tension built up during their aggressive sections. For instance, about half-way through the song, Puciato begins to scream atop an angular guitar riff and steady drumbeat. Then, as Puciato’s screams grow more desperate, the drums charge into double-time. Catharsis comes as the band transitions into a steadier and more ethereal chorus.
It’s this dynamic that gives “Option Paralysis” its explosiveness. However, this jolting technique also comes with a potential drawback—it can become, at times, exhausting.
Fortunately, the album’s intelligent track sequencing trivializes this would-be flaw. The record opens with the aforementioned “Farewell, Mona Lisa,” which clearly demonstrates the multiple styles TDEP have at their command. As the album continues, shorter, noisier songs are interspersed between their more melodic counterparts. For instance, after two particularly aggressive numbers, the band lines up the album’s centerpiece, a mathcore-lounge tune called “Widower.” The song begins with some jazzy piano playing that grows muddier as Puciato’s vocals crescendo, building into the song’s middle section, a paen to lost love animated by deft tribal drumming. Then, after the obligatory mathcore breakdown, the song heads into the album’s highpoint—when Puciato’s vocals and his bandmates’ guitarwork, which started in discord, resolve into a thunderous harmony. This ecstatic experience gives momentum to the next few tracks, its soaring melody energizing the heaviness around it. This energy continues through to closer, “Parasitic Twins,” a mood piece that ends the record on a mellow yet unnerving note.
One of the few flaws in the album is its overly-polished production. Long-time producer Steve Evetts captures the band with such clarity that they sound slightly clinical. With a more vicious production job, all 41 minutes of this album would have been a joy. Nonetheless, TDEP have succeeded in creating an album that is not just powerful on first listen, but deep and inspired enough to yield rewards upon further exploration. Though hyperactivity drives “Option Paralysis”, the record demands nothing less than full and unflinching attention.

Ludacris’s “Battle of the Sexes” has an ambitious title and premise that it does not live up to. When the album remembers to be a “battle” rather than an endless string of mildly memorable dance tunes and awkward sex songs, it presents a one-sided and misogynistic view of women affirmed by Ludacris and a host of male and female collaborators.
Ludacris’s strengths as a rapper have always been his unique Southern flow, his lyrical witticism, and his ability to create memorable dance songs that often start, revive, or climax parties. Some of his talents are clearly on display on “Battle of the Sexes;” his verbal syncopation and lyrical dexterity are especially evident on “How Low,” and “I Know You Got a Man.” On both tracks, Ludacris’s tongue skips over witty lyrics so quickly and skillfully that his self-congratulatory laughs and hoots seem well-deserved. The already-popular “How Low” is the standout party song on the album, its driving beats, thumping bass, and catchy chorus recreating the successful formula of his previous singles like “Get Back” and “Rollout.”
When the album strays from lighthearted party songs and into the territory of sex and relationships, it begins to falter. “Sex Room” and “Feelin’ So Sexy” are the two most awkward songs in that respect. “Sex Room,” a collaboration between Ludacris and Trey Songz, would be better if it was just by Songz. The sinuous melodies and the soulful, moaning lyrics of Songz’s chorus and verse make the song as sexy as it aspires to be, while Ludacris’s forcefully rapped verses stick out like a sore thumb. The most jarring line in the song—“Nipples hard as rocks / Lips as soft as cotton”—conjures up an incredibly unsexy vision of an aroused woman, only compounded by Ludacris’s extra emphasis on the word “rocks.” “Feelin’ So Sexy” feels like listening to other peoples’ phone sex, and Ludacris’s usually entertaining lyrical metaphors fail again when he says he’s going to make his girl “as wet as Niagara Falls,” a disturbing and decidedly unattractive thought.
The songs addressing relationships and the titular “Battle of the Sexes” are few and far between on the album. Perhaps this is because, for Ludacris, the words “sex” and “relationship” are effectively synonymous. The militant introductory song seems to promise a rap battle between Ludacris and female rappers addressing gender issues, but the album does not deliver. Perhaps “My Chick Bad” might be intended to be a shot in favor of women since it is somewhat complimentary to the fairer sex—“My chick bad / Better better than yours / Now your girl might be sick but my girl sicker / She rides that dick and she handles her liquor”—but it seems more like a celebration of Ludacris’s manhood than a tribute to women. The album includes a remix of “My Chick Bad,” which Ludacris christens, “The Pussy Rules the World Version.” Though the song features three female rappers—Diamond, Trina, and Eve—it still affirms women only in regard to their superior sex skills, clothes, and bodies.
“B.O.T.S. Radio” is the album’s ultimate, and most disappointing, exploration of the battle of the sexes. The song is set up like a radio show with rapped responses from Ludacris, Shawnna, and I-20 in response to caller complaints about their significant others. The music is sinister and aggressive and the song’s flow is very choppy. It could be intended as a tongue-in-cheek commentary on relationships, but the aggressiveness with which the rappers deliver their lines reveals a seriousness which makes the song all the more problematic. I-20’s verse about women is the most typically misogynistic, claiming that women at clubs prostitute themselves by wearing provocative clothing, giving him the right to feel them up. His lyrics do capture a particular male viewpoint, but neither Shawnna nor any of the other female rappers and singers on the album answer him, and the “battle” on the album feels distinctly one-sided.
“Battle of the Sexes” is not Ludacris’s best album, nor does it shed new light—or any light at all—on the battle of the sexes. When Ludacris focuses on innovative party songs and lighthearted wordplay he succeeds as a rapper, but when delving into real emotions, relationships, and meaningful discourse on male/female interactions and sex, he stumbles and ultimately falls, failing to produce work of the quality for which he is known.

She & Him are really catchy, but that is not necessarily a compliment. The indie-pop side project of actress Zooey Deschanel and musician M. Ward produce winsome and memorable tunes, but these tunes lack substance. The duo’s sophomore album, “Volume Two,” is a solid release, with pretty, bittersweet melodies, but the music breaks no emotional or musical barriers. Sticking to pathos with a smile, it offers very limited rewards.
As on their preceding “Volume One,” Deschanel sings, composes, and plays banjo and piano while Ward contributes production, backup vocals, and guitar playing. But listening to their music, the group sounds a lot more “She” than “Him,” Deschanel’s sound and outlook dominate the tracks.
“Volume Two” is chock full of pretty songs, but few of them truly stand out on their own. One exception is opening track “Thieves.” This cut sets the swingy, retro feel of the album, as Deschanel sings seemingly frivolous, yet insightful lyrics—”We two are makers, just made this mess / Two broken hearts don’t beat any less.” The sadness that comes through here marks one of the few moments of real emotion on the album.
Deschanel’s seeming inability to depict more than unhappiness, partially obscured by pluck, prevents most other tracks from conveying diverse or interesting emotions. One gets the sense that she only writes abstractly about problems people might have, as opposed to her actual experiences. “Me and You,” a melancholy yet slightly upbeat song featuring poignant strings and steel guitar picking is one such example. It takes the song’s narrator out of the picture, and focuses on an abstract subject, with Deschanel urging, “You’ve got to be kind to yourself.” Coming from a movie star with a successful musical career, this feels distinctly emotionally condescending.
Like Deschanel’s songwriting, Ward’s arrangements could have pushed themselves much further. The mixture of influences—doo-wop, Motown, old-school country music—makes the album feel fairly fresh, but it also inhibits it. Ward does not appear comfortable with any musical innovations, instead relying on decades-old standbys like harmonizing girlish voices and handclaps on “Home.”
One of the key features redeeming the complacency of most of the album is Deschanel’s voice, She & Him’s undoubted strength. Her vocals vary between soulful, childlike, and ethereal. Her voice adds enormously to the charm of otherwise run-of-the-mill songs. This is especially evident on the Ward and Deschanel duet “Ridin’ in My Car.” The song is typical She & Him: twangy harmonies deliver a bittersweet message of a lost summer love, matched with an upbeat poppy melody. But Ward’s voice fails to match Deschanel’s richness, and his parts are the low points of the song.
At times, however, complacency creeps even into Deschanel’s vocals. On “Gonna Get Along Without You Now,” Deschanel and her backup singers can’t even muster the requisite sass to convincingly pull off lyrics such as, “Uh-huh, mm-hmm / Gonna get along without you now.” Singing too sweetly, she fails to provide any edge to the track, and any possible feeling in it slips away.
Technically, there’s nothing wrong with “Volume Two;” Deschanel and Ward have produced a pretty, well-written record. But, as a second album, it could have gone a lot further. Their retro shtick works to an extent, but prevents them from reaching any musical or emotional heights. It’s light music at best, resolutely unwavering from its affect of bittersweet, upbeat melodies. She & Him’s vagueness ultimately fails to arouse any real feeling, leaving this album a disappointing failure.

For many, the words “natural history museum” may conjure up some fairly dry imagery: taxidermied beasts sitting tamely behind plate-glass windows, passive-aggressive signs warning patrons “please do not touch,” sterile exhibits scattered through maze-like hallways, and a gift shop by the exit to top it all off. Carlin E. Wing ’02 begs to differ with these preconceptions.
A graduate of the Visual and Environmental Studies (VES) department and a multi-disciplinary artist, Wing is currently organizing an event called Bizarre Animals at the Harvard Museum of Natural History. Using the building and its exhibits as their inspiration, Wing and a team of contemporary artists will take over the Museum on the night of March 26, installing the space with a variety of multi-media “art interventions.” Billed as a night that “will transform the Harvard Museum of Natural History into a laboratory, library, exploratorium, and stage,” Bizarre Animals promises to be an event where contemporary art, natural history, and strange beasts intermingle, reinvigorating the Museum and its exhibits.
Wing, who also currently serves as a Carpenter Center Fellow, conceived Bizarre Animals as an opportunity for artists to use the Museum itself as inspiration for projects. She invited several friends—including many fellow Harvard alumni—and gave them the freedom to propose projects based on whatever interested them about the Museum.
“The central aspect of it for me was to invite artists to come and each engage in the space in a different way,” Wing says. “Each person is taking what their creative practice is outside and bringing it into the space to create a special project.”
The open-ended, site-specific nature of the event has led to the development of a variety of projects. The team that created Bizarre Animals includes twelve artists in fields ranging from performance to poetry, sound design to video installation, and everything in between. Some of the projects that resulted are as delightfully odd as the exhibits that inspired them.
One alumnus—who refers to himself as Noah Feehan/AKA ’03—will install a video performance piece titled “Steak Filter.” The piece involves cooking a chunk of steak while displaying a live video feed of the meat on a monitor next to it. Feehan uses the steak’s conductive properties as a filter for the video signal. The meat itself is used to link the live video to the monitor, and it creates patterns of interference on the display, which gradually change as the meat cooks.
Beyond professionals and alumni like Feehan, some undergraduates will also have the chance to participate in the exhibit. Prior to the event, Wing and fellow VES alumna M. Elizabeth Glynn ’03 will conduct several cooperative workshops with undergraduates in which participants will discuss methods of documentation—a topic that has interested Wing since she studied photography as a student in VES. Her plan is to explore major questions about the relationship between performance, documentation, and their role in a museum environment. The seminars will culminate with the undergraduates deciding how to document Bizarre Animals.
Wing hopes these seminars will contribute to the open-ended nature of the project. “Maybe the students will decide that they are ahistorical and think we shouldn’t do anything. Maybe they’ll decide we should live stream it. Maybe they’ll decide we should just make sketches,” Wing says. “I’m just excited to have that conversation with them.”
Certain undergraduates will also have work on display during the event. Rebecca S. Lieberman ’10, a VES concentrator, will exhibit part of her thesis: a two-hour video installation that happens to dovetail with the themes of Bizarre Animals.
The video features a re-staging of an instructional taxidermy video, but Lieberman’s version replaces the dead whitetail deer from the original with a log of driftwood.  “Taxidermy is interesting in how the animal becomes a replica and a representation of itself,” Lieberman says. “In my particular video, I address the relationship between the process of taxidermy as a mode of representation and art and sculpture.” During the event, the video installation will play alongside an actual taxidermied deer, highlighting how her work comments on the “politics of display” inherent in taxidermy.
Lieberman notes that it has been encouraging to see alumni artists coming back to participate in the project. As a graduating senior hoping to pursue a career in the arts, Lieberman wants Bizarre Animals to raise awareness of the abundance of contemporary art that is created on Harvard’s campus and beyond.
“I hope that it will give people an opportunity to look at what young artists are making right now,” Lieberman says. “It’s important for people to see that there are artists in the Harvard community who make art, and there are alumni who go on and continue to make art.”
Bizarre Animals is certainly a unique event, but it looks as if it may not be the last of its kind. Wing credits much of the project’s success to the Museum of Natural History and its commitment to bringing all kinds of new, innovative programming to its patrons. Elisabeth Werby ’72, the Executive Director of the Museum of Natural History, expressed great excitement about these projects in an emailed statement.
“Good art—whether or not contemporary—can help people see the world in new ways,” she writes. “The Museum has a strong tradition of offering experiences at the nexus of art and science—from the exquisite models of botanical specimens, the Glass Flowers, to our recent photography exhibits. Bizarre Animals continues this tradition and takes it to a new level.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you want to read Harvard’s copy of Poul Gerhard’s “Pornography or Art,” you’ll have to ask permission. The Fine Arts Library limits access to this book, among others, to the “Cage”—which is, thankfully, not nearly as intimidating as it sounds. Should you ask, you’ll be escorted to the back of the library into a series of offices that most patrons never see. Fill out the appropriate form, and you’ll be seated at a long conference table to read. As you flip the pages, the avuncular man in the corner office will chat about what he’ll have for lunch.
In “Pornography or Art,” the precise Art Nouveau illustrations of Oscar Wilde compatriot Aubrey Beardsley are juxtaposed with rough-etched instructional diagrams from Japanese bridal books from the Middle Ages. The text that accompanies these images, in its unwaveringly academic tone, makes the artwork all the more shockingly graphic. It’s clearly not intended to titillate the reader, but one can see how it might nonetheless.
The book is part of a growing collection of explicit material housed by the Harvard College Library (HCL). Encouraged by Harvard’s tendency to avoid academic and scholastic censorship, a surprising range of erotic art has appeared on campus in libraries, classes and student publications. Some of this art implements explicit content to achieve a higher social or artistic purpose, and some encourages us to enjoy the explicit for its own sake.
DON’T JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER
Dan C. Hazen jokes that he’s worked for HCL forever—more precisely, twenty years. For the last six, he has served as Associate Librarian for Collection Development.
Harvard’s libraries maintain no special collections devoted exclusively to sex and sexuality. But, according to Hazen, “Explicit stuff? We’ve got a lot of it.” Search on HOLLIS for “Erotica” or “Pornography,” and you might be surprised by the results.
“We’ll have a representative sampling of that kind of material as we would of regular women’s magazines, sports publications—any realm of popular mass activity,” he said. However, he added, “[we’re not] dirty old men pushing pornography on innocent students.”
Responsibility for collection development is distributed among HCL’s bibliographers, each of whom is assigned to suggest new collection items from a specific part of the world. Hazen said, “[We take] pride in being able to ferret out both the mainstream and the fringes, presenting a full spectrum of what’s being said and thought and argued.” There are no particular rules by which bibliographers must abide, provided the material is legal. For proposed collection additions, price is more often an issue than objectionable content.
About fifteen years ago, a professor offered to donate a complete run of Penthouse Magazine to Widener Library. (Which professor? “I probably shouldn’t say,” Hazen laughed.) The collection was to be stored behind the desk in the Periodicals Room, requiring patron request for use. This ultimately didn’t work out, but only because, as Hazen put it, “The older women on staff were extraordinarily uncomfortable with the notion they’d have to be handing that stuff over.”
As scholarly interests have shifted toward legitimizing the study of sexuality and pornography, explicit literature has grown increasingly accepted in research library collections. In fact, Hazen said, the difficult question is more frequently where to store material, not whether to accept it in the first place. Pornography is typically housed in closed circulation areas—not for moral concerns, but because, in Hazen’s experience, “it disappears almost as fast as you put it on the shelf.” When the books and magazines themselves aren’t stolen, explicit images are often razor-bladed out of them.  But even restricted material is no more difficult to obtain than items stored in the Harvard Depository. Otherwise, it is simply contained within a controlled reading space—the Fine Arts Library Cage, for example.
Harvard takes a similarly laissez-faire stance regarding the content of students’ work. Julia A. Rooney ’11, a Visual and Environmental Studies (VES) concentrator, paints—and paints whatever she wants. “Most professors are completely, completely open to whatever you have to throw at them,” she said. “They’re artists themselves. Everything is fair game.”
Rooney has taken classes with people pursuing independent projects involving everything from nude photography to polemic political content. “I think it’s more about how the thing is dealt with than what exactly it is,” she said.
VAGINAS OF HARVARD
“Vaginas of the Harvard Community,” credited to Colette S. Perold ’11, is a collage of sixteen black-and-white photographs, laid out in a four-by-four grid. Half of the images depict vaginas and half other objects—a head of lettuce, an elongated flame—but even these, in context, take on a distinctly labial character. Now imagine this piece juxtaposed with “Expanding Consent,” a thoughtful, 8000-word interview with feminist activist Jaclyn Friedman, also by Perold. The two were sandwiched together in the same issue of H BOMB Magazine, a student publication explicitly focused on sexuality. Together the pieces seem sexy but smart, smart but sexy—just how H BOMB presents itself.
To co-editor-in-chief Christian L. Garland ’10, the magazine is anything but pornography, as some have labeled it. H BOMB takes itself very seriously, and we want students to as well,” he said. “I was really drawn to [H BOMB] because sex is something that is often not talked about in a thoughtful manner, at least at Harvard. I wanted to be part of that conversation.”
When it was founded in 2004, the magazine produced two issues and generated nationwide publicity. Resurrected in 2008—in what Garland calls a more “literary” form—the magazine has since published two more issues, with another to arrive in April. According to Garland, H BOMB enjoys freedom from editorial interference by the college: “Harvard has not tried and isn’t going to try to censor what we produce.”
As a relatively new publication, production costs have been an obstacle. To offset expenses, the current newsstand price is $10. The staff face further challenges in securing advertising from businesses reluctant to endorse explicit content, regardless of its artistic and intellectual quality.
And H BOMB strives to keep its quality high. It solicits all types of fiction, nonfiction, poetry, and artwork that reflect an interest in gender, sex, or sexuality. “The editorial board seeks out really cool and challenging material,” said Garland.
Nevertheless, he’s only mildly satisfied with the magazine’s reception on campus. “A lot of people appreciate it and are really passionate about it,” he said. “But a lot of people write it off as another iteration of smut produced by college kids.”
Garland added that the sexual politics of Harvard are complicated: “[The university has] pockets of really radical approach to sex and sexuality, but is also the site of incredibly reactionary and conservative thought.” Garland, who co-chairs Harvard College Queer Students and Allies (QSA), considers it the mission of H BOMB to combat this sexual shame. “The more people talk about sex,” he said, “the more comfortable they’ll be with it, and the healthier their sex will be.”
The theatrical equivalent of the “Vaginas of the Harvard Community” is, of course, “The Vagina Monologues.” The annual Harvard student production of the play is co-sponsored by the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (OSAPR) and the Women’s Center. This year’s show took place on February 11 in the Agassiz Theatre.
M. Amelia Muller ’11 is no stranger to Harvard theater. She appeared in the 2008 Freshman Musical, and in the last year, served as set designer for both “Big River” and “The Flies.” But this semester? “I wanted to do something that scared the crap out of me a little bit,” she said.
“The Vagina Monologues” is a series of—you guessed it—monologues, based on hundreds of interviews playwright Eve Ensler conducted with women of all ages and backgrounds. First performed in 1996, the play has garnered worldwide fame. The monologues unpack a cultural history of sex, rape, and female empowerment, with the universal catalyst being, naturally, the vagina.
In February, Muller gave voice to “The Little Coochie Snorcher That Could,” a multi-part monologue from the point of view of a victim of childhood sexual abuse. Muller played the 16-year-old version of this woman; three other actresses portrayed the same character at younger ages. Of these, Muller had the longest part, and she found it was anything but easy.
“I had to get comfortable with what I was talking about,” she said. But by opening night, Muller was ready. “It seemed totally natural to be up on stage talking about coochie snorchers.” She credits the support she received from the show’s audience and cast members, whom she now considers close friends.
To those who might be offended by “The Vagina Monologues,” Muller said, “in a lot of ways, that’s sort of the point. You have to be willing and open to be a bit shocked, and then think afterwards about why you were shocked. What the show reveals to you is all these different ways to appreciate your body, and what you’re capable of as a woman.”
Of all the monologues, “Coochie Snorcher” is especially controversial because it describes the teenager’s sexual awakening at the hands of a 24-year-old female neighbor—technically statutory rape. Not all respond well to it. Rachel L. Wagley ’11, Co-President of True Love Revolution—an undergraduate organization which promotes premarital abstinence on campus—expressed her group’s distaste for the production in an e-mail: “[This play] trivializes the legacy of women who have achieved great things with their intellect, dedication, and creativity by reducing them to the sexual. The Vagina Monologues glorifies perversion—including the rape of a 13-year-old child...” Wagley refers to an unrevised version of the script, where “Coochie Snorcher” was originally three years younger.
Muller would disagree. “When it comes down to it,” said Muller, “[the monologue] is about a girl learning that pleasure is natural, and understanding that her body is a good thing.”
Sarah A. Rankin, Director of the OSAPR, assesses openly sexual art based on its purpose or intent. “It’s not that the erotic is bad per se,” she said. “Who’s telling the story and how it’s being depicted is very important.”
A co-sponsor of the production for three years running, OSAPR provides the “The Vagina Monologues” student staff with funding, publicity, and a supportive organizational structure. Rankin acknowledged that “The Vagina Monologues”—the proceeds from which were donated to the Boston Area Rape Crisis Center and Haiti relief—is sexually graphic. “[But] the intent of the show is to give women a voice,” she said.
In conjunction with Women’s Week, OSAPR recently organized a screening of the documentary “The Price of Pleasure.” The film surveys the state of mainstream pornography, ultimately speculating that the problem with most erotic film is that it depicts sex, quite literally, through a single lens. Instead, Rankin suggests, we should be exposed to a plurality of sexuality and sexual experience.
“When I’ve heard sexuality experts talk about the erotic, it’s a critique of what’s happening, not that it is happening. They’re not saying ‘Let’s be puritanical and avoid all images of sexuality,’ but that we need more perspectives and more thoughtful discussion,” she said.
A BOY’S BEST FRIEND
For some artists, such thoughtful discussion is decidedly optional. When Matthew M. Di Pasquale ’09 was in middle school, his babysitter gave him a copy of Hustler. He found the nudity unpleasant at first, but nevertheless smelled opportunity. He began to buy issues for $20 from his babysitter, and then resell them to his classmates for $40. “I’ve been in the business for a while,” he joked.
Di Pasquale is the founder and editor-in-chief of Diamond Magazine. While not technically affiliated with Harvard, the publication is famous—or infamous—on campus. Very much in the tradition of men’s magazines like Playboy, Diamond contains editorial features on sex and dating as well as—the ‘money shot’—nude photographs of students. The Crimson’s own FlyByBlog has facetiously characterized Diamond as a reinvention of H BOMB including “all of the nudity without that stupid artsy shit.”
Funded largely by Di Pasquale himself, the first issue of Diamond was produced by a team of 15 students—mostly Di Pasquale’s high school friends who attended other colleges—and a photographer they found on Craigslist. In preparation for its September 2008 debut, Diamond advertised only through word of mouth, but coverage on blogs like Gawker and IvyGate quickly heightened the buzz. Di Pasquale estimates that the first issue, available for free online, was downloaded 10,000 times in the first three days. The second issue—which cost $9.99 to read beyond a free sample—sold over 100 copies.
Di Pasquale himself has achieved a certain measure of personal notoriety as the only model to pose nude in the magazine’s first issue. He doesn’t regret the decision, but admits he wasn’t fully prepared for the consequences. “Now I let models know from experience,” said Di Pasquale, “Your picture’s going to be on the internet and shit and you might get a lot of attention.”
Diamond seeks to recruit Ivy League models, though the staff have received an excess of submissions from students from other schools. They have also heard from Ivy League students “[who are] maybe not really beautiful or whatever.” Di Pasquale thinks this qualification is key to the magazine’s appeal—“[Readers think,] ‘Oh, my god, I can’t believe [an Ivy Leaguer] would do that.’ When people think Ivy League, they think of someone ready for a career in finance, pretty conservative.”
He doesn’t worry too much about the ideological implications of his product.  “[Diamond is] not really artsy, but I wouldn’t call it porn,” he said. “But who really cares?” Overall, Di Pasquale considers Harvard to be quite liberal in its acceptance of sex. And University censorship? Di Pasquale doesn’t think it’s a problem: “According to the First Amendment, they don’t limit speech and stuff.”
But maybe we’re not all the way there yet. “[Harvard should have] a wild sex show in the Agassiz Theater,” he suggested, “That would be the most badass fun ever.” It seems—if we can justify its scholastic purpose—the University might be up for the challenge.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For a potter, Miranda J. Thomas has an impressive range of clients. Her work has made its way to the White House and the Vatican. Together she and her husband direct ShackletonThomas, a Vermont-based company specializing in handmade furniture and ceramic goods. Born in New York to British parents, and raised in Italy and Australia, Thomas brings a global approach to a locally minded, artisanal trade. On Tuesday, March 23, she will conduct a workshop run by the Office for the Arts’ Ceramic Program.
The Harvard Crimson: What pottery techniques and insights do you plan to cover in your workshop?
Miranda J. Thomas: I normally teach techniques and the history of patterns. I talk about commemorative things that I do, and giving pottery as gifts. Since ancient times, pottery has been used as a libation vessel and as a form of paying tribute—people would present each other with golden vessels. It was something to treasure. Pottery became symbolic of that ceremony, only we don’t give golden vessels any more—instead we give bare bowls.
When you’re a potter you have to bear in mind that people want to send a message of peace or congratulations, or of being truly happy about something. It has been the potter’s role in history to convey that message. I’m not really interested in artistic expression in the sense of inventing something new every ten minutes—there are important points in people’s lives, and I want to commemorate them.
THC: How did you begin taking commissions from the White House and the UN? What is it like to work with such high-ranking clients?
MJT: It started off with a simple little dish. I remember hearing on the radio in 1999 that it was the longest America had been at peace, and thought it would be really cool to send a gift to Bill Clinton. It was a humble pot, made by American hands; it was sort of to say, “Thank you, and it’s up to you to keep the peace.” The next thing you know I got a letter back from Bill Clinton, that said, “Thank you so much for your kind words, all my regards....”
A few weeks later we sent out a card with a picture of a turquoise and gold piece on it, saying we were having an opening. We got a phone call from the White House saying that they wanted 16 turquoise and gold pots just like it, to give as gifts to Middle Eastern dignitaries in the next 24 hours. We didn’t have any so we sent other examples of symbolic pots in many different styles.
Three weeks later we got another call. They asked, “Is there any way you can do a very large carved porcelain bowl with a peace dove on it, and have it ready in 6 weeks? You must do it because it’s going to be President Clinton’s personal gift to the Pope.” I talked to my husband and said, “I think I have to do this,” and he agreed. I went down that afternoon and threw the bowls....
Years later, the UN Association of New York needed a gift for Kofi Annan to commemorate his ten years of service. I was asked to make a large white porcelain peace bowl with a ring of gold on it. The UN also wanted to do something to award Ban Ki Moon for his work on water conservation and relief around the world so I designed an aqua colored bowl with fish to symbolize water and was asked to present it to him.... Right now I am working on making gifts for different heads of state.
THC: How do you think craftsmanship fits into the context of a major university like Harvard? What role should artistic training play in education?
MJT: It’s absolutely imperative for human beings to make things, especially when you’re using your brain all the time. Some people can’t articulate through writing, so they learn to speak with their hands.
Right now we are going through a technological age, which is helping art because it’s so visual. We need to spend much more time increasing visual literacy, so that when you see a symbol you understand what it means. The younger generation is getting flooded with images, and they aren’t given the tools to understand them.
People have come to rely on machines and have lost confidence in what humans can do themselves. My husband and I believe so strongly in things that are handmade, but they’re on the verge of extinction. We’re trying to keep it alive—we’re the dirt-pitch rebels, the last of the line!
THC: To what extent do your designs reflect your multicultural background?
MJT: Every type of pot comes from a certain tradition. Using certain materials and symbols, you can instantly conjure up a particular culture. There’s turquoise for the Middle East, blue and white for Delft [from the Netherlands], the bottle green ware of France, the ironware of Japan and Korea. If you use those techniques they immediately evoke a culture, and if you mix them you create hybrids. You hope that people can pick up on it—that’s where an increase in visual literacy comes into play.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Eighteen months in the making and a year in the revealing, the much-anticipated report of the Committee to Review the Administrative board is finally in the open. The report, released by Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds on Mar. 10, consists of three parts: The first covers changes that have already been implemented by Dean Hammonds at her discretion, the second contains recommendations for changes to faculty rules that will require a vote of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences for implementation, and the third presents a set of issues for further “discussion and consideration.”
It is the third section, which provides recommendations for incorporating more student participation in the Ad Board process and increasing the role of the Resident Deans, that represents the most important and exciting change to the Ad Board system. Increasing student input would be a fundamentally positive development in reforming Harvard’s disciplinary process.
This is not to ignore the substantial and positive changes that Dean Hammonds has already taken steps to put in place. The College has done a good job of trying to make the Ad Board process more transparent and increasing support for students that appear before the board.
In particular, the change that requires the Secretary of the Ad Board to deliver disciplinary decisions to students instead of their resident deans addresses the difficult and awkward situation of having students’ resident deans act as both their advocates and judges. Under the new rules, personal advisors to students undergoing Ad Board review are also allowed expanded capacity to guide their advisees through  Ad Board procedures. In the interest of reducing student anxiety during personal appearances before the Ad Board, such appearances will now take place in front of a much smaller sub-committee of typically six or fewer members (as opposed to the entire Ad Board).
These changes are admirable efforts to make an inevitably uncomfortable situation somewhat less intimidating for students and to give students a better chance to adequately defend themselves and feel some sense of agency.
The proposed changes in the second section of the Ad Board report look promising as well. Providing disciplinary options besides two-term withdrawal in cases of academic dishonesty and introducing an official avenue of action that allows professors to deal with certain cases in-house (something many faculty members have apparently already been doing unofficially) will bring greater uniformity to the disciplinary process. Modification to the language in the Handbook for Students will bring transparency to the Ad Board and make students more knowledgeable about its procedures.
Given the sensible and encouraging reforms offered by the Ad Board report, it is a shame that it took so long for the report to be released. We hope that the College will go so far as to institute some form of student participation in the Ad Board process. While it is true that change is better late than never, we might point out that sooner, rather than later, is ideal.

Who is Desiree Rogers? Why do we all know her name?
Why does the name of this two-time queen of the Zulu Social Aid and Pleasure Club draw more hits on Google than that of Vice President Biden, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, or U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon? Who is this woman so notable as to be listed alongside Secretaries of State Hillary Clinton and Madeleine Albright on Wellesley’s “notable alumnae” webpage?
Until her resignation last Friday—the fallout of the notorious party-crashing of a White House gala by Tareq and Michaele Salahi—she was President Obama’s White House social secretary—the nation’s highest-ranking party planner.
It’s not as if the position of social secretary boasts any historical import—Rogers’ predecessor Amy Zantzinger wasn’t exactly a household name, and comparable oblivion likely awaits Rogers’ successor, Julianna Smoot. Rogers may be the first black social secretary, but it’s probably safe to say that, with the election of the first black president, African American children can aspire to higher callings than arranging tea parties for the First Lady.
And yet, in the wake of Rogers’ resignation announcement in February, the media has been wallowing in a prolonged and farcical state of grief and lamentation. The Washington Post’s Robin Givhan, for one, bewailed how “Rogers’s departure has the fashion industry practically in mourning. No one has expressed a whiff of excitement over her replacement, Julianna Smoot. Instead, there’s concern that Washington might end up in cultural retreat.”
Givhan’s Post colleagues Anne Kornblut and Krissah Thompson, likewise, absurdly injected race into the Rogers saga by noting how “…some of those who admired Rogers as a trailblazer said they were sorry to see the first African American social secretary also become the first high-level departure from Obama’s senior staff.”
But no pundit articulated a more appropriate response to this circus than blogosphere banshee Michelle Malkin, who wrote simply,“Three words: Boo-freaking-hoo.”
Three things and three things alone differentiate Rogers from social secretaries past: her race, her chic, and her bungling of the Salahis affair. None of these three traits justify the grossly excessive media coverage that she has received, and this ailment, this risibly misguided belief that ethnicity and fashion sense can render even the White House social secretary relevant, plagued not only the Washington media establishment but also Rogers herself.
Almost from the minute she stepped foot into the West Wing, Rogers began posing for magazines like Vogue and the Wall Street Journal magazine, antics one can hardly envision the dourer Zantzinger or Smoot emulating. An inside source told Politico that at one point, Rogers wondered why, as social secretary, she did not have her own driver. Eventually, David Axelrod had to warn Rogers to stop parading around in expensive clothes and talking up the “Obama brand” in the midst of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.
We are all quite used to the media trumpeting the trivial, be it Anna Nicole Smith or Chesley Sullenberger. But this latest obsession with a heretofore irrelevant and obscure White House staff position—the White House social secretary—is simply product of another vice: the delusion harbored by Washington media types that the trifling goings-on of their city matter to those who live beyond the Beltway. This media elite is easily distracted by bright, shiny objects, and the fact that anyone outside the White House has ever heard of Desiree Rogers is an indictment of the media’s skewed priorities.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If we were to play spot-the-difference between a depressed lady who chats to her cats and a ruthless Al-Qaeda terrorist, we’d be here for quite a while. The U.S. government’s most recent conquest in the war against terror seems more imbalanced than intimidating, and her image as a serious threat is difficult to take seriously. Similarly, the latest hacker to be caught—an autistic man in search of UFO evidence—hardly matches the profile of a high-level criminal mastermind. Were such individuals to be put on trial under normal circumstances, the code of the justice system would demand that their mental instabilities be taken into account. However, given that the victim in both these instances is the government, it seems highly unlikely that such protocol will be upheld. The overlap between insanity and criminality is multi-faceted and ill defined, but to argue that criminal mental impairment must be discounted under certain crimes is absurd. The insanity defense is a crucial aspect of all advanced legal systems, and it should not waver simply when the government is targeted.
The fear hyped around “Jihad Jane,” seems, frankly, overstated. While there is no doubt that the blonde intended to cause harm and committed a serious crime, she hardly seems a cause for great security concern. Legally named Colleen La Rose (“Jihad Jane” was a title created for a MySpace page), she was so inept that she advertised her terrorism skills on YouTube. LaRose suffered from depression and alcoholism, and even her intended victim, cartoonist Lars Vilks, joked about the woman “with this fantastic name,” who is “a bit low tech.” And despite adamant claims about her dedication to killing Vilks, the 46-year-old travelled to Sweden and returned to the U.S. without any attempt to commit the crime.
While LaRose appears to be an unhinged woman falsely raised to the status of a major terrorist, she is at least guilty of harmful intentions. However, Gary McKinnon, accused of “serious and deliberate damage,” seems to be simply a very good hacker who is foolish. The autistic, unemployed computer programmer hacked into U.S. military, intelligence, and government networks in order to look for evidence on UFOs, and left notes to demonstrate security weaknesses. While McKinnon’s actions caused harm, he clearly cannot be compared to a vindictive attacker attempting to damage U.S. information systems.
In fact, the U.S. government’s eagerness to imprison McKinnon seems to stem from embarrassment that an untrained hacker under the influence of cannabis could access high-security systems. Indeed, it is shameful that McKinnon apparently gained access by checking which system users still used the default “password” as their password. Few genuine threats to America have been caught in recent years, and it seems plausible that the excitement surrounding Jihad Jane and McKinnon is relief that someone can now finally be detained.
While the insanity defence is rarely used in full, it is absolutely essential that U.S. courts take “mitigating factors into account.” In order to correctly administer punishment, a legal system is moral required to consider the extent to which the defendant can be held responsible for their actions. A defendant may be acquitted if they acted  “under such defect of reason from disease of the mind” as to not realize why what they were doing was morally wrong.
Based on this legal practice, it would still be inconceivable that Jihad Jane will be acquitted. However, she is clearly mentally unstable, and it seems absurd to place LaRose’s punishment on the same level as those who have worked consistently toward terrorist ideology and attacks.
Conversely, it is entirely plausible to argue that McKinnon might be deemed not guilty. He has a mental disability, and it’s believed that were McKinnon tried in Britain, where the crime was partly committed, he would receive a non-custodial sentence, “since his actions were motivated by an undiagnosed disorder over which he had no control.” Furthermore, the 75-year sentence the U.S. has threatened seems particularly immoral, as someone with autism would suffer excessively in prison. According to Joel Sickler, head of the Justice Advocacy Group in Virginia, McKinnon would be “almost certainly be exposed to neglectful care,” as the U.S. Federal Bureau of Prisons “has a well-known and terrible track record of delivering on any type of health care required by an inmate, especially those with some form of mental impairment.”
The insanity defense is a necessary aspect of any legal system concerned with human rights. Neither McKinnon nor LaRose are the sinister threat that either is purported to be, and, while both have committed crimes, their blatant mental instabilities should affect their custodial sentence. A just legal system should be influenced only by the nature of the criminal, not the victim.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Against the strong wind of public opinion, Congressional Democrats passed a massive government takeover of health care in America on Sunday. This slap in the American people’s face is all the more egregious because of the opportunity the Democrats had to pass truly landmark, bipartisan legislation under allegedly “post-partisan” leadership from President Obama. Republicans and Democrats alike agree that health care is too expensive, and that, in the absence of reform, budgetary realities of Medicare and Medicaid will force harsh fiscal choices.
The opportunity for cost curve-bending reform was there: there were substantive changes on which Republicans would have voted “Aye.” Instead, the Democrats chose to pass along party lines a 2409-page bill, with an additional 153 pages of amendments, dictating from Washington how to operate 16 percent of the economy. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the bill calls for $938 billion in spending over the next decade. Where will the nearly $1 trillion in spending be funneled?
The bill’s central tenet is a law preventing insurers from denying coverage to individuals with pre-existing conditions. To do this, Democrats mandate that all Americans buy insurance in order to prevent people from gaming the system. This mandate in turn requires government subsidies for those who cannot afford coverage.  These three new regulations amount to what Paul Krugman calls the “three-legged stool” of reform.
But the overwhelming reason many Americans lack sufficient coverage is not pre-existing conditions, but rather the cost of health care, which the bill does little to correct. Moreover, even the “three-legged stool” appears unstable when you examine the details.
First, 16 million Americans will be added to the failing government-run Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program rolls. That is, half of the 32 million Americans that the bill’s proponents claim will be covered are dumped into a government-run program that America already cannot afford. While 87 percent of doctors reported accepting all or most new privately insured patients in 2008, only 53 percent of doctors reported accepting all or most new Medicaid patients, because Medicaid reimburses doctors below market rates.  What good is Medicaid coverage if a doctor refuses to see you because of it?
Meanwhile, the bill’s new subsidies are hardly targeted at the have-nots. A family of four making up to $88,200 annually—roughly $30,000 more than the 2008 median household income—will receive subsidies from the legislation. Democrats claim that these changes, plus other minor provisions (like allowing children to remain on their parents’ insurance until age 26 and limiting the amount that smokers can be charged relative to non-smokers for insurance) will reduce the deficit. With nearly $1 trillion in new spending, how could this possibly be true?
The answer: a combination of tax increases and fiscal smoke and mirrors. The legislation raises taxes by $569.2 billion and cuts funds from Medicare and Social Security. Democrats are also able to claim that the bill cuts the deficit because, while the insurance subsidies don’t start until 2014, many of the taxes kick in within months. In other words, the changes the bill makes to the health-care system itself will cost $938 billion, as estimated by the CBO, and to fund it, Democrats use taxes and accounting gimmicks. Not only could the new revenue sources have instead been used to fund better ends like healthcare vouchers or lowering the deficit, but they are also unrelated to the systemic causes of high health care costs (like moral hazard caused by the incentives of the current fee-for-service system and the lack of preventive care). The idea that the alleged deficit reduction comes from bending the cost curve in any meaningful way is breathtakingly disingenuous.
One example of the type of “savings” the bill offers is the “Doc Fix” provision. Under current law, Medicare payments to doctors are scheduled to be cut by 21 percent in April, and then continue to decline for the rest of the decade. While this cut is typically reversed by Congress before it occurs, the oft-quoted CBO analysis of the Democratic health care legislation assumes that the cut will proceed and adds the savings to the reform’s tally. Without the “Doc Fix,” the CBO concludes that the bill adds to the deficit over the next decade. We’ll believe that Democrats will cut Medicare payments when we see it. But even if they are serious, wouldn’t it make more sense to put these savings toward the $100 trillion unfunded liability in Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security than to compound the budgetary problem by forcing more Americans on to Medicaid?
That’s what makes this attempt at reform so disheartening. Democrats could have, with Republican support, enacted radical changes to the U.S. healthcare system that would reduce costs for American families. Instead, they put a costly, partisan band-aid on the gaping bullet wound of skyrocketing health care costs. This is not “change” we can, or should, believe in, and we can only “hope” that Republicans win back enough seats in November to repeal it.

When he entered Harvard, he had scored a two on the Calculus AP exam, failed a French placement test, and was unsure of the difference between derivative and partial derivative notation, but Steven Levitt ’89, author of New York Times best-seller Freakonomics, has come a long way from his undergraduate days.
Addressing a packed room of students and Cambridge locals at the Radcliffe Gymnasium last night, Levitt spoke about his path from opening week of his Harvard freshman year to becoming one of Time Magazine’s 100 People Who Shape Our World. He was the third of four speaker’s in the 2009-10 Dean’s Lecture Series, a program of the Radcliffe Institute’s Academic Engagement Programs.
“I’m not going to be too academic today; mostly, I’m just going to tell stories,” Levitt began.
During the speech, Levitt, who was awarded the 2004 John Bates Clark Medal as one of the most influential economists under the age of 40, cheekily thanked the institutional barriers in place to prevent students from failing out of college, and claimed his acceptance to MIT was a “complete and utter mistake.”
He “never dreamed [he’d] be an academic economist,” Levitt said.
The economist half-jokingly cited his father as inspiration for studying off-beat economic issues.
“I have no talent, you have no talent. If people like us are ever going to succeed in a profession, we have to find a topic that no body else in the world is willing to study, so you can be the best at it,” Levitt recalled his father telling him.
He took his father’s advice, going on to research topics such as sumo wrestling, cheating, and names people give their kids. He decided, he said, not only to concentrate in economics, but “breathe economics into everyday life.”
The talk concluded with a discussion of some of the topics covered in his books, including the inner-workings of a crack cocaine gang, alternative strategies for climate change, CIA and terrorism, and the business side of prostitution.
Levitt’s speech elicited diverse reactions from the audience. Diego Ibarra, a Ph.D. student at the Graduate School of Design, said he thought Levitt’s solutions for climate change presented moral problems because, he said, they would increase carbon emissions, which are the root cause of climate change.
Others said they thought the talk was inspirational. “It was great to hear how he thinks, to hear personal anecdotes, and what makes the man who comes up with such great economic discoveries tick,” said Samuel F. Himel ’12.

Certain blood cancers may be caused by the surrounding bone marrow in which blood is produced, according to recent findings from researchers at Harvard’s Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology department.
Led by principal investigator Dr. David T. Scadden of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute, the team of researchers has succeeded in refuting the common notion that cancer emerges from the mutations of a single cell.
“Cancer is thought to be a process by which a cell accumulates a series of genetic injuries in a multi-step process,” Scadden said. “Our model says that one of those steps can occur in a neighboring cell.”
By specifically altering genes in the progenitive bone cells of mice, the researchers were able to observe a profound disruption of blood formation.
The lead researcher, Dr. Marc Raaijmakers of Massachusetts General Hospital, noted the significance of such a disturbance.
“As a hematologist, [the disruption] reminded me of a disease seen in humans called myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), which tends to evolve into the blood cancer leukemia,” Raaijmakers said.
This discovery demonstrates that instead of arising through mutations primarily in the blood cells, as previously thought, cancer may be formed in support cells—the bone marrow.
“Stem cells maintain our tissues and get their signals from their environment,” Scadden said. “We just happened upon this finding that in fact abnormal signals can not just prevent stem cells from functioning normally, but can change the whole system.”
According to Raaijmakers, the medical community hopes that this research will help bring new therapies for those suffering from leukemia.
He also said that the results have the potential to be applied to other types of cancer.
The research team will now have to investigate the exact signals that occur between the bone and blood cells in order to figure out which are pertinent to the formation of leukemia.
Raaijmakers said that once these signals are known, they can be targeted and ideally prevented from coming to completion.
Researchers are already conducting follow-up research to continue and build upon this discovery. Because the model was conducted on mice, and thus has not yet been proven on humans, Scadden said the team of researchers is now “examining the cellular setting of patients with these human blood cancers.”

Three veteran administrators—two Harvard affiliates and a former member of Massachusetts state government—assumed positions in the top ranks of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ financial administration earlier this month. The appointments come as FAS looks to pare down its budget, which still rests $80 million in the red.
In an e-mail statement, FAS Dean of Administration and Finance Leslie A. Kirwan ’79 announced that interim Associate Dean for Finance Eric Kopstain and interim Associate Dean for Physical Resources and Planning Michael N. Lichten will now assume these positions full-time.
Kirwan also announced that Maryann Bradley, a former assistant secretary in Massachusetts’  Executive Office for Administration and Finance, will take on the position of FAS Associate Dean for Administrative Operations.
In their newly permanent positions, Kopstain, Lichten, and Bradley report directly to Kirwan, who wrote in the e-mail announcement that she was glad to “have recognized the talent and capabilities that exist in abundance within our FAS community, while also bringing in fresh perspectives from the public sector” in making these three appointments.
According to FAS Spokesperson Jeff A. Neal, there are no plans to replace the former positions of the new deans, leaving two administrative positions off the payroll.
Arriving from 20 years of public service, Bradley will take charge of FAS-wide initiatives as the school implements long term responses to the recent budget crisis, according to Kirwan.
“She brings a wealth of administrative and finance experience to her new role at the FAS,” Kirwan wrote, referring to Bradley’s work for the state.
Kopstain had been serving as a temporary replacement for former associate dean Deena Giancotti since November, when Giancotti left the position to work in the private sector.
Kopstain arrived at Harvard in 2005, following nearly two decades in budget administration at Dartmouth and Northwestern University. When Giancotti departed, Kopstain, who was then director of the budget, undertook her responsibilities in addition to his own.
Lichten came to Harvard in 1981 after a brief career as a publ0ic school English teacher. Upon arriving he worked on a program to make FAS more energy efficient and has since overseen building operations and maintenance, as well as environmental health and safety.
In his new post, Lichten is responsible for a budget that is “considerably” over $100 million, he said. Although “we’re not building any new buildings right now” because of the current financial situation, plans for future construction are in the works, Lichten said.
FAS Associate Dean Robert G. Doyle praised both of his colleagues who are stepping into their positions full-time.
“Eric [Kopstain]’s a really sharp guy,” Doyle said. “He takes the time to understand and to share the concerns of the operation.”
Doyle also said that his experience with Lichten dates back to 1986. From their work together on the University’s 350th anniversary, “It was clear that he was somebody who knew what he was doing,” Doyle said of Lichten.
University administrators provided little information on the searches to fill these three vacant positions, though information about the openings was posted online for applicants.
In their newly permanent positions, Kopstain, Lichten, and Bradley report directly to Kirwan, who wrote in the e-mail announcement that she was glad to “have recognized the talent and capabilities that exist in abundance within our FAS community, while also bringing in fresh perspectives from the public sector” in making these three appointments.
“They probably looked to see who else is interested [in the positions] and decided, ‘You know, we have the best candidates right here’,” Doyle said.

The Crimson Galeria—a complex of restaurants located at 57 JFK Street—is currently undergoing renovations to facilitate the addition of two new establishments: an Indian restaurant called Maharaja and a Korean steakhouse called Bull.
After recent closings in the Galeria, restauranteurs said they are eager to open new ventures in Harvard Square.
The new establishments will fill the spaces recently vacated by the Indian restaurant Bombay Club and the Japanese eatery Shilla. They are slated to open in late spring or early summer, according to Raj K. Dhanda, the owner of the Crimson Galeria.
“[The Galeria] is one of the extremely rare buildings in Cambridge,” Dhanda said, “It has five sit-down restaurants of very diverse cuisine. I think it’s a great destination.”
Bull—the Korean restaurant slated to open in the basement of the building—will feature grills at every table, where patrons’ orders will be cooked directly before them. The restaurant is the brainchild of Henry Kim, who said he believes the unusual format of his restaurant will appeal to local diners.
“Harvard Square people always want to try something new,” Kim said, “Our concept will fit really well in Harvard Square.”
The other restaurant scheduled to open this spring is an upscale Indian eatery called Maharaja. It will be on the second floor of the Galeria—the location which, for the last 18 years, was home to Bombay Club, a restaurant which moved to Boston’s South End district in October 2009.
Dhanda said he believes the fare served at Maharaja will improve upon Bombay Club’s food in both variety and quality.
This series of  turnovers began last year, when Kwanghyun Yoon moved his restaurant Shilla from the basement of the Galeria to the second floor.
Yoon—who managed Shilla for 13 years—opted to open a new restaurant called Shabu-Ya when space on the second floor became available.
Yoon said he moved to create a restaurant with more light and a modern design, as well as an expanded menu.
Shabu-Ya, a Japanese and Korean eatery which opened in November 2008, is now the only restaurant in Harvard Square to serve shabu-shabu—or “hot pot”—style cuisine.
Yoon said he was frustrated that another Korean restaurant would be coming to the Galeria, but remained confident in Shabu-Ya’s business prospects.
“Luckily, we have a good clientele here in Harvard Square,” Yoon said.

President of Estonia Toomas H. Ilves discussed the relationships between the EU and NATO, and between Estonia and the Soviet Union yesterday at the Harvard Kennedy School.
Widely acclaimed for the political freedom and economic development made possible in Estonia under his leadership, Ilves drew a large Estonian audience, including an Estonian woman who was over ninety-years old and too weak to climb to the fourth floor of Littauer Building, and who waited downstairs for the President until the seminar ended.
The lecture segment of the event focused on the relationship between NATO and the EU.
The real problem, according to Ilyes, is that NATO and the EU do not talk to each other, and if the lack of formal and legal communication continues, Europe will see little progress in the near future.
In comparing NATO and the EU to the left and right sides of the brain, respectively, Ilves said that the two must communicate with each other in order to function normally.
In addition, Ilves discussed the tensions between Russia and Estonia.
In response to a question about why history textbooks in Estonia portray the relationship with the Soviet Union in a negative light, Ilves said he doesn’t “think there’s anything wrong with hating the Soviet Union.”
He then drew a distinction between the Soviet Union and Russia by paralleling the differences between the two nations to the differences between Nazi Germany and the Federal Republic of Germany.
But according to Marshall I. Goldman, Senior Scholar in the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies, the present history textbooks in Estonia may cause animosity against the Soviet Union amongst the younger generation.
Another audience member presented an alternative viewpoint.
“When I was in school we still had Soviet textbooks...which taught that Estonians were all being liberated,” said Andres Sevtsuk, an Estoniain MIT graduate student at the seminar, but “I do think that history should be taught factually, and I don’t think there ought to be a deliberate distortion.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Vogue Editor-In-Chief Anna Wintour and fashion designer Michael Kors were among the prominent speakers from the fashion industry who spoke about eating disorder awareness at the 13th Annual Public Forum presented by the Harris Center at Massachusetts General Hospital.
The forum, titled “Health Matters: Weight and Wellness in the World of Fashion,” was held at the Harvard Business School and focused on the actions being taken by the fashion industry to reduce the high prevalence of eating disorders among models.
Wintour highlighted the progress that the fashion industry had made over the last few years, including setting minimum age requirements for models, banning alcohol and tobacco backstage at fashion shows, and limiting working hours for young models.
She further urged professionals in the industry to “identify young women who could be suffering from eating disorders” and said “we are all responsible for the models’ health”.
American fashion designer and Project Runway host Michael Kors also commented on the trend of using young models for runway shows.
“The age of models really has to become a priority,” he said. “We need to give these girls a chance to grow up.”
Kors further pledged to not use any models under the age of 16 in his shows, a promise the audience greeted with a large round of applause.
“Having this conversation in an open forum is a huge step in the right direction,” Kors said. “We have to assess models as individuals”.
Russian supermodel Natalia Vodianova was able to speak of her personal modeling experience to illustrate many of the issues Wintour and Kors had identified.
Vodianova, who first came to Paris at the age of 18 to pursue modeling, commented on the difficulties that many models face working at a young age in a foreign city.
“It is very hard to have a feeling of stability,” she said. “Anorexia is sometimes the only form of control these girls have”.
While the forum stressed advancement and increased sensitivity in the fashion industry, some attendees were more critical.
Harper Dangler, a resident of Cambridge, said he thought “it would take a while” before action was taken, primarily because “we don’t focus on prevention in this country and this is a disease that requires such action. This is not just a fashion issue.”
As the forum came to a close, Dr. Herzog, director and founder of the Harris Center, applauded the speakers. “The industry needs your inspiration and you’ve risen to the occasion,” he said.
Vodianova reflected similar sentiments.
“It’s in fashion now to be healthy,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hip-hop artist Kid Cudi will be performing at the College’s fifth annual Yardfest on April 18, the College Events Board and the Harvard Concert Commission announced yesterday.
Kid Cudi, the stage name for three-time Grammy nominee Scott R.S. Mescudi, is best known for his song “Day ‘n’ Nite,” which appeared first as a digital download and then on his 2009 debut album “Man on the Moon: The End of Day.”
“The CEB and the HCC both felt that Kid Cudi was an extremely mainstream artist that would meet as many of the musical tastes of the Harvard student population as possible in a singular artist,” said HCC director Synne D. Chapman ’11, who is also a Crimson magazine editor.
CEB vice-chair Stephen G. Anastos Jr. ’11 declined to comment on whether there will be a second performer at Yardfest;  for the past two years, the event featured two acts.
Cudi’s upcoming Harvard performance was confirmed at 2:50 pm yesterday by his agent’s assistant at William Morris Agency. The evening concert will take place in Tercentenary Theatre.
Last fall, the CEB conducted a poll asking students to vote on potential Yardfest artists and musical genres.
Kid Cudi was the second most popular artist and hip-hop was “by far the most requested genre,” according to Anastos.
“In years past, we received criticism for getting washed-up artists, but Cudi’s up-and-coming,” he added.
Singer-songwriter Sara Bareilles and electronic group Ratatat performed at Yardfest last year to 7,100 audience members, a record number.
Yesterday’s announcement follows a month of contract negotiations after Cudi, through booking agency Pretty Polly Productions, informally agreed on Feb. 17 to play at Harvard.
Kid Cudi will be performing at Babson College the night before Yardfest. He will also be performing at Miami University, Duke University, and Bucknell College throughout March and April.

CORRECTION: March 23, 2010
Due to an editing error, an earlier version of the Mar. 23 news article "Rapper Kid Cudi To Perform At Yardfest" incorrectly stated that last year's Yardfest was the first time the event featured two acts. In fact, Gavin DeGraw and Wu-Tang Clan performed at Yardfest in 2008, and Ratatat and Sarah Bareilles performed in 2009.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
(Part I of this story appeared on March 22, 2010.)
When the Administrative Board informed Anna earlier this spring that she would have to withdraw from Harvard for two semesters, she was wholly unprepared for the tumult and anxiety that accompanied the process of withdrawal—an experience she characterized as “being thrown to the wolves.”
She had been in the middle of shopping week when the Ad Board, the College’s primary disciplinary body, delivered the news of her punishment for charges of academic dishonesty last fall. Anna—whose name has been changed to protect her identity—had to leave campus, hunt for a job, and find a new way to afford her prescription medication, which had previously been covered by the University.
Anna is not alone. Jeff, another Harvard student who spoke on the condition of anonymity, had failed two classes and was subsequently forced to withdraw in what he called a “very traumatic process.”
Their stories provide a rare window into the often overlooked consequences of withdrawal from the College. Every year, an average of 70 Harvard students face a “requirement to withdraw”—the Ad Board’s most common response to cases of academic dishonesty and a relatively standard response to serious academic failures.
College administrators say that withdrawal offers students a valuable opportunity to take a step back to reflect on their life goals and time at Harvard. But students like Anna and Jeff point to an array of potential problems in the withdrawal process, such as the punishment’s lack of relevancy to the original infraction, the sudden loss of health services at the University, and the pervading sense of isolation it instills.
If the Faculty of Arts and Sciences approves the recommendations proposed by the Committee to Review the Ad Board, the College will have a greater array of intermediate disciplinary measures at its disposal—likely leading to a decrease in the number of students who are required to leave campus.
The Committee recommendations offer a welcome change for students and faculty who feel that withdrawal is too harsh a punishment for most incidents of academic dishonesty.
But some students hope that the College will consider further reform that provides greater support for students who ultimately must undergo the withdrawal process.
“I wouldn’t wish the turbulence of this experience on anyone else,” Anna says.
“MIXED MESSAGES”
Students and administrators tend to disagree about the merits and drawbacks of a requirement to withdraw.
College administrators say that students should not view the requirement to withdraw as a punishment, but as an opportunity to retreat from the frenzy of the Harvard scene and reflect on their misdemeanors and life goals.
“It’s really designed to be a break...from the academic treadmill,” says Secretary of the Ad Board John “Jay” L. Ellison.
During their time away, students must hold a full-time paid job for six consecutive months—a requirement intended to encourage “a consistent pattern of behavior and success” in students, Ellison says.
The required withdrawal is in line with the Ad Board’s principle of pedagogical discipline, in which disciplinary actions are ultimately meant to be educational, rather than punitive, according to Ellison.
“Just having time to actually think about what they want from an education...is pretty unequivocally valuable,” says Adams House Resident Dean Sharon L. Howell. “I wish everyone would take a term off and think about that.”
But some students contend that required withdrawal is a flawed disciplinary response, as well as an ineffective educational measure.
Though Jeff—the student who had to withdraw after failing two courses—agrees that his removal from campus gave him the chance to gain fresh perspectives, he nevertheless says that required withdrawal is a “fundamentally stupid” process.
“It seems like its the default response to anything the [Ad Board] sees,” Jeff says. “But there was just a real failure to engage with the causes of [the original problem].”
The prevalence of the required withdrawal response is indicative of a “disconnect” between the Board and other offices in the College, such as the Bureau of Study Council—which could have been a far more effective on-campus resource for his academic problems, Jeff says.
“My year off didn’t really make me want to [do work for my classes] any more than before,” he says. “It just made me realize that the consequences are so bad that I never want to not [do work] again.”
While he was on the Committee, former Undergraduate Council President Matthew L. Sundquist ’09 says he had heard many “mixed messages” about the quality of students’ required withdrawal experiences: “I would say most students found the process to be confusing,” he says.
The discrepancy between the Ad Board’s perceptions about the effectiveness of required withdrawal and the negative accounts of some students may be, in part, the result of the Board’s primary source of information.
The Board mainly receives feedback on the withdrawal process through personal statements that students are required to submit to be considered for readmission to the College. But these evaluations may not be entirely reliable.
“I wrote all this bullshit about how I realized what a luxury academic study was,” Jeff says of his readmission statement. “It was true to a certain extent...but I absolutely omitted everything I thought [the Ad Board] didn’t want to hear.”
Ellison admits that students may feel pressured to write what they believe will cast them in a positive light for readmission, a position echoed by Sundquist.
“When...the reason for writing the statement is to be readmitted to the College, I think you can sometimes suspect and conclude that [students] are willing to take a one-sided view of facts,” Sundquist says. “I would too, if I were writing that statement.”
A GREATER RANGE OF DISCIPLINARY MEASURES
Recommendations from the recently released Report from the Committee to Review the Ad Board propose that the Ad Board be given a wider array of disciplinary responses to cases of academic dishonesty—including actions less drastic than required withdrawal, such as a penalty to a student’s grade.
A major driving force behind the recommendation was the Committee’s realization that withdrawal may be an excessive response in many cases, Sundquist says.
The report, which only addresses academic dishonesty policy, will not affect cases of forced withdrawal due to poor academic performance, as in Jeff’s case.
Though the Committee agreed that a requirement to withdraw can prove beneficial for some students, they felt that withdrawal may not constitute an “appropriate” response to most cases of academic dishonesty, according to Committee member Donald H. Pfister, professor of systematic botany.
“We felt there could be an educational moment [in many academic dishonesty cases] that right now wasn’t being realized,” Sundquist says. “If there are more different responses, we think there will be a lot fewer required withdrawals.”
A LACK OF SUPPORT
Thought the Committee’s recommendations may address the issue of matching incidents of academic dishonesty with the appropriate disciplinary response, the proposals are not a panacea for many of the difficulties experienced by students who do have to withdraw.
Anna says that the lack of support from the College during her recent withdrawal has led her to feel “completely discarded” by Harvard.
Anna had been seeing mental health therapists and receiving prescription medication from University Health Services, and says that she did not realize she would lose her health insurance through Harvard until she had only two days left of coverage.
However, the loss of insurance is a state-mandated law, according to Ellison.
“Our UHS staff help find students providers in the area and try to make certain the transition is smooth,” he says.
But Anna says UHS did not have readily available information to help her find an alternative health plan, and she left campus without the medication that she considers “vital” to her well-being. As of now, Anna is still uninsured.
“I’ve spent the most of these past three weeks struggling with [drug] withdrawal symptoms,” she wrote in an e-mail to her resident dean in February. “It seemed that the University went from caring whether I was chronically depressed or had any intentions of hurting myself to not giving a damn what happened to me now that I was on my own.”
Anna, who also addressed her suicidal thoughts in the e-mail, says she never received a response from her resident dean.
Indeed, some students complain that withdrawal cuts them off too severely from the College’s resources and campus life itself.
Students required to withdraw are supposed to have limited contact with the College during their time away, as “part of the goal is separation and reevaluation for the student,” Ellison says. “We do let the student know that we have every intention of having him or her return to finish.”
Howell says she tries to have “regular check-ins” with students in her House who have been required to withdraw.
But the amount of student-dean communication varies from dean to dean.
Jeff says that his House’s resident dean post was a “revolving door position,” occupied by four different people in the span of his dealings with the Ad Board and his subsequent two-term withdrawal.
Jeff characterized his required withdrawal as a “very isolating” experience: “You lose your Harvard e-mail address, you are forbidden to set foot on campus, forbidden to participate in any extracurriculars,” he says.
The sense of alienation can continue even after students return to campus, Jeff says, since many students required to withdraw gradually lose touch with many of their old friends and acquaintances back on campus.
“You have some spiel [for your peers] about why you were gone for a year, and of course it doesn’t mention the Ad Board,” he says. “But there’s always a hint of comprehension [in their minds].”
Anna and Jeff say they hope to see the College seriously re-evaluate the requirement to withdraw to improve the process for students in the future.
“The College is not a charity, but they should at least have enough ethical awareness to be supportive for the students they are asking to leave,” Anna says.
Administrators agree that the withdrawal process is not without its weaknesses. Howell, for example, called the question of medical insurance “one of the most difficult” issues the Ad Board deals with.
“It’s being thought about,” she says. “There’s definitely a recognition by the College that [the rapid loss of medical insurance does not create] an ideal circumstance.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While Harvard wrestler J.P. O’Connor made history this weekend, becoming the first Crimson grappler to finish the season undefeated as he captured a national championship, another Ivy League school made some history of its own.
Cornell’s men’s basketball and women’s hockey teams are both playing the role of Cinderella in their respective NCAA tournaments—the first-ever wins on the national stage for both teams.
After dismantling Temple, 78-63, on Friday, the Big Red men’s hoops squad made a statement yesterday, earning an 87-69 win over Wisconsin to earn a trip to the Sweet 16.
Cornell’s first-round win was the first for an Ivy League school since Princeton won its tourney opener in 1998, and it is now the first Ancient Eight squad since Penn in 1979 to advance to the second weekend of play.
The Quakers made a run all the way to the Final Four that season.
The Big Red draws top-seeded Kentucky in its Sweet 16 matchup, a team that is on an offensive roll in the tournament so far. The Wildcats hit the century mark in a 100-71 win over East Tennessee State in the first round before beating up on Wake Forest, 90-60, in Round 2. But the squads will tangle in Syracuse, N.Y. on Thursday—just an hour away from Ithaca.
While the Cornell men were making waves in Jacksonville, Fla., the women’s hockey team made an impressive run of its own in the NCAA Frozen Four in Minneapolis, Minn.
After the ECAC auto-bid failed to deliver home-ice advantage to the Big Red, Cornell came to Cambridge on March 12 with a mission. And the Big Red proved that it’s well on its way to becoming the next Ivy powerhouse, routing Harvard, 6-2, in the quarterfinals.
Cornell then took out No. 1 Mercyhurst in a 3-2 overtime win in the national semifinals on Friday, earning a spot in the national championship game against Minnesota-Duluth yesterday.
The national title game was one for the ages, as the triple-overtime battle was the longest game in championship history. Big Red goaltender Amanda Mazzotta made a title-game-record 61 saves, but Bulldog forward Jessica Wong brought her team’s fifth national championship back to Duluth with 33 seconds remaining in the third overtime period.
Though its Cinderella run was stopped just short of the national crown, Cornell women’s hockey has a lot to look forward to—all three of its All-Americans return to Ithaca next year, as does Olympian Rebecca Johnston.
All in all, it was a good weekend to be a Big Red fan—and oh yeah, Cornell left the NCAA wrestling championships with an individual winner and a team runner-up prize too.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Athlete of the Week distinction is reserved for a Harvard competitor who excels in a given time frame, standing out among seven days’ worth of effort across all sports. But wrestling co-captain J.P. O’Connor has not limited his brilliance to periodic outbursts. The career wins leader in program history has been the definition of consistency, translating a record-setting freshman campaign into four years of sustained excellence, overcoming injuries and setbacks in the process. This week, O’Connor simply vaulted the last hurdle—adding a national championship title at 157 lbs. on Saturday after coming so close in previous years.
“I truly believed sophomore and junior year I could win it…so [losing back then] hurt a lot,” said O’Connor in his post-match press conference. “But I tried to turn it into a positive…This year I did a much better job of pushing [negative thoughts] away, just reminding myself that I’m the best guy in the country.”
With a 6-4 victory over No. 7 Chase Pami of Cal Poly in the finals of the NCAA wrestling championships, the Crimson senior capped a strong tournament run—in which he outscored opponents, 51-10—by earning the third national title in Harvard history and leaving little doubt about his No. 1 ranking. In addition, O’Connor (35-0) hangs up the Harvard singlet as the owner of the only undefeated season in program history, bolstering a 132-16 mark that ties the Oxford, N.Y. native with Jesse Jantzen ’04 (132-13) atop the program list.
“Jesse is a New York guy too…so his name has been in my mind for a long time now,” O’Connor said. “As great of a wrestler as he is, he’s an unbelievable guy too…I’m so happy to even be mentioned next to Jesse.”
Yet with all the accolades—add three All-American nods, two Ivy League Wrestler of the Year honors, and an EIWA championship to the list—O’Connor’s greatest accomplishment may be the mark that the co-captain leaves on Crimson wrestling as a mentor and a model of hard work.
“J.P. is a great leader,” said freshman Adam Hogue, O’Connor’s wrestling partner in practice. “We just kind of see him as another guy on the team, but at the same time everybody looks up to him.”
And this admiration for Harvard’s co-captain stems not just from his good nature, but also from his lead-by-example attitude on the mat.
“J.P. is very tenacious, always in your face,” Hogue added. “He’s as well conditioned as anybody else in the room and he doesn’t ever stop.”
This constantly running motor hasn’t just helped in college; it may have been the key to building O’Connor’s interest in wrestling from the outset—when the grappler’s 3rd-grade PE teacher noted the future star’s potential.
“I randomly got pushed into this sport by my primary school gym teacher—he was the varsity wrestling coach,” O’Connor explained. “He must have recognized that I was a tough little crab running around in PE class. He said, ‘Why don’t you come be [the wrestling team] manager?’”
Soon enough, the seven-year old O’Connor was smitten, and he embarked on a path that would conclude under the lights of the Qwest Center in Omaha, Neb., where over 15,000 fans—including his parents—witnessed perfection.
“I’m so fortunate to have the family that I do,” O’Connor said. “They traveled around with me all over the country [when I was younger], so I owe a lot to them.”
Co-captain Louis Caputo was also among those left marveling at O’Connor’s feat.
“Nothing could have made me feel better than watching him wrestle the best he’s ever wrestled,” Caputo said. “[O’Connor] deserves everything he gets and more. I was just thrilled.”
By tearing through a 33-man field that pitted him against Iowa’s Jake Kerr, No. 5 Steve Fittery of American University, and longtime nemesis Pami, O’Connor concluded his collegiate career at the top of his game. But the three-time All-American isn’t ready to hang up the singlet for good—not when it’s been over a year since his last defeat. Instead, O’Connor is prepared to take his effort to the next level on the international stage.
“I’d love to [keep wrestling],” he said. “I can’t think of anything better than representing the Unites States of America in a world championship or an Olympic championship, so I’m going to push and train while my body still allows me—at least through 2012.”
Any more time spent training does not bode well for O’Connor’s opponents. After four years of sustained brilliance, the Crimson superstar—at last a national champion—has shown no signs of slowing down.

Harvard has its crossover athletes. There’s Melanie Baskind, who plays both soccer and lacrosse; Cara Sprague, who competes in cross-country and skiing; and Nina Kucharczyk, a field hockey and lacrosse player.  But who knew that lurking within the ranks of the Crimson’s distinguished track and field team is a world-ranking jump roper.
If you search sophomore Christine Reed’s name on YouTube, you’ll find the pole-vaulter and heptathlete jumping at a dizzying speed to Lil Wayne’s “A Milli.” Her concentration and confidence makes the sport seem effortless.
But Reed’s jumping mastery shouldn’t belie the sport’s difficulty. The track and field star’s journey to achieve this level was a challenging one, filled with hectic schedules but also lifelong friendships.
“I met her back when she was in first grade,” said Reed’s jumping coach of 11 years Cindy Joy. “She was a very good athlete from the beginning, but I had no idea how successful she would go on to be.”
Reed was introduced to jumping rope in kindergarten. The American Heart Association branch from Santa Claire, Ca. advertised a jumping class at an assembly in her school. Reed and her closest five year-old friends pounced on the opportunity. Little did she know at the time that this newfound passion would take her to far reaches of the globe.
“I coached Christine right through her junior year of high school,” Joy fondly recalls. “We traveled so much together—to Australia, Belgium, and Canada [for the world championships]. We became very close. She’s every coach’s dream.”
Reed perfected her coordination as a jumper, but managing school and sports was a whole other balancing act. Beyond doing track and traveling internationally for jump rope, she was president of her high school class and an accomplished student.
“Jumping and doing track together was really hard on my body,” Reed acknowledged. “I even suffered a stress fracture in my foot.”
As demanding as Reed’s schedule was from elementary through high school, it instilled a level of maturity early on in her life that was absent in her peers.
“[Jumping] made me physically and mentally strong from a young age,” Reed said. “I was only 12 when I went to my first world championship in Belgium. It’s definitely taught me a lot about how to compete—especially the importance of creativity and innovation.”
But with such an exhausting array of activities and schoolwork, the trade-off between jumping rope and track was inevitable—one that Reed cites as the hardest decision of her life.
“I gave up competitive jumping to concentrate on track,” Reed explains. “It was really difficult for me.”
The emotional transition was not without rewards. Right where Reeds competitive jumping career ended, her collegiate track career took flight.
She ranks ninth all-time in Harvard’s record books in the heptathlon after last year’s 4,231-point performance.
Reed has also had a successful indoor season thus far. She placed third in the pentathlon at this year’s Heptagonal Championships.
Track and jumping haven’t been mutually exclusive for Reed, as many of the skills she gained from jumping have been instrumental to her success on the field.
“I’m her training partner, and I really think that jumping rope has spring-boarded her into a really hard worker,” observed Reed’s roommate and teammate, sophomore Nicole Silva. “She consistently pushes herself to do better, train harder. Jumping is definitely a key source of her motivation.”
Nine years of competitive jumping also crafted Reed into a fine leader, one who has learned first-hand the values of communication and cooperation.
“Chemistry with my fellow jumpers was really key, as far as collaborating routines went,” Reed notes. “That’s certainly carried over for me on the track and even beyond.”
Reed may enjoy jumping, but if there’s one thing that excites her more than strategically twirling a rope, it’s teaching her friends how to do it.
Indeed, when the Crimson’s track and field squad held its annual talent show at Texas Southern Relays over spring break, Reed and a few of her teammates lit up the stage with a jumping routine. Despite going up against formidable competition—a poetry session and a rendition of “Super Trooper” by the freshmen throwers—Reed and company came away with the top prize.
One might think that it would be intimidating to perform a jumping routine alongside a world-caliber competitor.
“Not at all,” Silva promptly dismisses. “There was this simple routine that our whole group did together, and then Christine and I transferred off into our wheel routine. She’s a phenomenal teacher. She made it really fun in an acrobatic sort of way.”
Although Reed won’t be making appearances on the competitive jumping circuit, she looks forward to staying involved with the sport in a new capacity. In addition to currently teaching a class at her home gym, she hopes to form a jumping team after college, coach, or serve as a competition judge. Given Reed’s work ethic and the respect she commands from friends and teammates alike, this goal is well within reach.
“Christine has always been extremely disciplined,” Joy emphasizes. “She’s never been one to cheat anybody out of giving them her full effort. That’s what made letting her go so hard for me.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A week-long break from classes is nearly guaranteed to lighten the mood of Harvard students. The fickle, Maryland winds that accompanied the Crimson sailing team’s during the three weekend regattas provided a welcome boost to the morale of the coed squad but only produced vexation for the women’s team.
“The wind was light,” junior Quincy Bock said, “and so were we.”
The coed squad gained some ground when it placed sixth at the Truxton Umsted Intersectional Regatta, but the women didn’t have quite the same success due to different conditions, as they placed 15th out of 18 teams at the St. Mary’s Women’s Intersectional Regatta. Meanwhile, back in Massachusetts, the freshmen held their own as the team took third at the Central Series BC Conference Regatta.
“We’d been practicing all week,” Bock said. “We were mentally and emotionally prepared for the regatta.”
TRUXTON UMSTED INTERSECTIONAL REGATTA
Though the coed squad is only in its third week of spring racing, the team was ready to knock off programs from different regions of the country.
“It’s probably the biggest regatta of the spring,” Bock said. “We were expecting there to be a lot of good teams.”
Among the tough competition,  Harvard’s sailors were able to prove their own mettle. Junior John Stokes was the most successful skipper of the weekend, leading the B boat to a second place finish. Stokes’s boat excelled out of a field of twenty, as it snatched two first-place and four top-four finishes on Sunday while racing with Bock.
“It was lucky for us that we had just practiced and that it was nice, light and choppy,” Bock said.
Bock’s switch to the B boat proved to be a good strategic move, as both the A and B lineups posted better finishes on Sunday than they had the day before. Switching with Bock to captain Alan Palmer’s A Boat was junior Meghan Wareham, helping the boat come in sixth place. The A boat took two third-place finishes on Saturday but landed outside the top ten for the majority of the day’s races. The following day Palmer and Wareham made the top ten in nearly every race, and notched one first-place and five top-five finishes. Rounding out the coeds’ finishers were junior Teddy Himler, who took fourth in the C division, and classmate Colin Santangelo, who finished 13th in the D Division.
ST. MARY’S WOMEN’S INTERSECTIONAL REGATTA
Maryland’s gentle winds weren’t quite as kind to the women’s team as they had been to the coeds, as the squad took 15th place at St. Mary’s College.
“Overall it was a pretty disappointing weekend for us,” sophomore Emily Lambert said. “It was really light wind. The conditions were really not ideal for sailing.”
Lambert skippered her A boat to 14th place, the higher of the two women’s team finishes. But despite the team’s disappointment, the weekend was not without bright spots, as Lambert and freshman Alma Lafler took second in the weekend’s third race.
The B boat, skippered by captain Liz Powers and crewed by sophomore Marie Appel, also notched a second-place finish in the sixth race. Powers and Appel were able to improve over the course of the weekend, moving from 16th and 17th place finishes in the early races to top 15 finishes in later ones.
“We definitely learned a lot about racing in light air,” Lambert said, “And dealing with frustration and getting back into the race despite being frustrated.”
CENTRAL SERIES BC CONFERENCE REGATTA
While their upperclassmen counterparts were racing against schools from all corners of the country, the Crimson freshmen took on more regional foes in the Central Series hosted by Boston College. Only the host school and the University of Vermont were able to top the rookies, who placed third out of 11 schools.
Just like their upperclassmen teammates, the B boat led the way as Sam Millham and Jin Zang took third in the division with 42 points.
Their A boat teammates, Ryan Byrne and Sarah McCuskee, also fared well on the waters, notching fourth place in the A division and scoring two first-place finishes in the process.

When asked if he had ever used Yéle money for personal benefits, Cultural Rhythms 2010 Artist of the Year Wyclef Jean tearfully replied, "absolutely not." Few doubt that Jean, Fugees star and Yéle Haiti Foundation founder, cares about the Haitian people, but many are raising questions about financial decisions made at the Yéle Haiti Foundation that have steered money towards Jean and his associates including, as Gawker reports, his rumored mistress, Zakiya Khatou-Chevassus.
The Smoking Gun, a Web site that posts legal documents online, reported that Jean and his business associates received $410,000 in payments from Yéle Haiti from 2005 to 2007. According to Yéle Haiti's tax returns, the charity paid out $31,200 in rent to Platinum Sound, a recording studio co-owned by Jean; $100,000 for the "musical performance services of Wyclef Jean at a benefit concert;" and $250,000 to Telemax, S.A., "a for-profit Haiti company in which Jean and Duplessis were said to 'own a controlling interest.'"
The controversy has extended beyond the blogosphere—The Washington Post reported on financial irregularities within Yéle Haiti's organization, quoting a former tax counsel to the Senate Finance Committee, who said, "it seems clear that a significant amount of the money that this charity raises go for costs other than providing benefits to Haitians in need."
Now, Gawker has reported that Yéle Haiti paid Zakiya Khatou-Chevassus, Jean's personal assistant and rumored mistress, $105,000 for "program development" as an independent contractor in 2008. Khatou-Chevassus' compensation represents one third of Yéle Haiti's 2008 budget for management and general expenses and three times the salary of Suzie Sylvain, Yéle Haiti's dedicated program director, according to Gawker.
While Jean has responded to some of the allegations in a YouTube video, many questions remain unanswered. Responding to the controversy surrounding Jean, Harvard Foundation Director S. Allen Counter said in an emailed statement, "Wyclef Jean was honored in December 2009, by the Nobel Concert Committee when he was asked to perform at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert inn Oslo. Two months later, on February 26, 2010, Jean was honored by the venerable NAACP for his humanitarian efforts over the years in his native Haiti... He accepted our invitation and visited Harvard College on February 27, 2010 as the 2010 Cultural Rhythms Artist of the Year, based on his nomination by students for his contributions to the performing arts and his humanitarian work with the people of Haiti over several years, but especially for his recent Haitian relief efforts in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake."
Cultural Rhythms afternoon co-director Kevin X. Liu ’11 and evening show co-director Miguel Garcia ’12 could not be reached for comment.

As The Crimson reported yesterday, Kid Cudi is coming to Harvard.  The three-time Grammy-nominated artist who produced the 2009 smash hit  “Day  'n' Nite” will  be the featured artist at this year’s Yardfest, the annual concert  put on by the College Events Board and the Harvard Concert Commission.  The hip-hop artist has toured with Lady Gaga and Asher Roth, and  has recorded songs with heavy-hitters like Snoop Dogg and Jay-Z.
Although most Harvard students  are certain to recognize the trip-hop influenced melody of “Day ‘n’  Nite,” the Mexican-African-Native-American Cleveland resident,  whose  birth name is Scott Mescudi, has a number of other tunes you should check out:
“Make  Her Say feat. Kanye   West & Common,” which includes a sample from Lady Gaga’s “Poker  Face”
“Pursuit   of Happiness feat.  MGMT & Ratatat,” which features one of last year’s featured  Yardfest artists, Ratatat.
Kid Cudi also has some mixtapes   and albums you should listen to. Cudi’s debut mixtape, “A Kid Named Cudi” can be downloaded legally and for  free online, and includes some fantastic songs, including “Down  & Out,” which  samples Outkasts’s “Chonkyfire.”  Kid Cudi’s first commercial album, “Man on the Moon: The End of  Day” peaked at number four on the Billboard 200, and includes many  of his most famous songs.
Get educated on Kid Cudi,  and then get excited Harvard—he is about to rock Yardfest all  day and nite.
