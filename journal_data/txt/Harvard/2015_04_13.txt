After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Creepy dudes are everywhere, man.”
Thus begins just one of comedian Aziz Ansari’s new stand-up routines, featured on his new special “Aziz Ansari: Live at Madison Square Garden.” It’s perhaps one of the most timely and relevant stand-up specials of this generation thus far—he touches on the issues of relationships, fear of missing out, being a second-generation immigrant, and even the meat industry, among other things.
And it’s surprisingly relatable. Of course it’s true that creepy men are on the Internet and are unfortunately willing to sexually harass women behind the virtual mask of anonymity. Aziz isn’t afraid to get explicit in his criticism: “If you’re a dude, never yell ‘Take it off’ unless a woman has placed a tarantula or scorpion on one of your shoulders.”
What about the fact that everyone under the age of 30 is terrible at making plans? Aziz has an explanation: “No one wants to commit to shit. ‘Cause they’re terrified that something better’s gonna come along. It is so rude—why do we do this?”
And why? Some of the more celebrated comedians of the present age—Louis C.K., Dave Chappelle, Amy Schumer, Jim Gaffigan—are either too old or simply fail to address the important issues of the current generation. This is a technology-enabled cohort who has learned to adapt from VHS tapes and CDs to iPhones and Facebook and Instagram, and yet our most famous comedians are still cracking jokes about airplane food, peanut allergies, and Hot Pockets.
It’s a bold foray into uncharted territory for Aziz, and it’s one that ultimately proves successful. “I’m the first generation in my family that was born in America,” he says to applause. Even outside of his widely loved character on the television show “Parks and Recreation,” Aziz is simply a relatable guy. “My dad’s a doctor, and he said when he first got here it was very hard, ’cause the head of the hospital was very racist and wouldn’t ever send him patients,” he shares. Given the current political climate, it’s not a surprising story.
It’s sometimes said that the best comedy finds unexpected insight in the most serious or tragic of circumstances—that the best comedy has the ability to illuminate new perspectives. For this generation, at least, Aziz is that comedian. He sees our technology-dependent hypocrisy and calls us out on it. “It used to not be like that,” he laments.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you look at the my.harvard.edu events calendar, which you’ve never looked at, you’ll find that there are about a thousand things going on at every hour. If you look at the new Undergraduate Council calendar app, which you’ve never looked at, you’ll find even more. And if you look at the Crimson opinion section, which you’ve never looked at happily, you’ll find one article every day telling you that you do too many of those things and that you should relax more.
A lot of people at this school think that students do too much. They think that students risk their mental health because they do so many things. They think that the Harvard community suffers because of this culture of doing a lot of things all the time.
But, to me, the discourse surrounding mental health on campus is too focused on quantity. Rather, it should be focused on quality.
Specifically, we need to realize that all the things we do here—from the academics to the extracurricular activities—don’t matter. Really. They don’t matter at all. The tests don’t matter. The internships don’t matter. The activities don’t matter. Nothing students do at this school matters.
Once we realize that, the pressure surrounding all the things we do on campus suddenly vanishes. All failures become inconsequential. And our mental health improves.
Of course I’m overstepping a bit. The things people do obviously matter to the people who do them, or else they wouldn’t be doing them. But if we ask whether the things people do really matter in a broader sense, the answer is often a resounding “no.”
Take our academics for example. We read. We write. We calculate. We experiment. And that’s all very useful for learning critical thinking skills that will help us pursue our goals and do all sorts of good things in the world later on. It matters in that sense.
But is anyone else going to be affected if you bomb a test? Will anyone care if you were able to derive an equation in physics that Newton derived a hundred years ago on a napkin for fun? Will anyone care what your ethnography of one charter school in Boston says about social inequality in the United States? The truth is that our educational triumphs and failures matter only to us and our educators. And that allows us to fail and learn in a constructed environment without any large consequences.
That seems obvious. But despite those widely accepted facts, some still place a lot of consequence and importance on their grades, as if their GPA will forever determine their lives. As a result, midterms and papers become gut-wrenching and stressful.
In reality, those feelings of importance, stress, and worry are completely artificial. Even if you do bomb your test, grade inflation elsewhere will more than make up for it. And for those students whose grades are really poor, you can take time off. People shift around their priorities and they improve. There are actually very few ways to wholly screw up. The system is constructed so that you can’t. That’s what makes it educational. And that’s a good thing. Those minor screw-ups along the way don’t really matter.
Outside of the academic realm, not much matters as well. Take internships: People place a lot of importance on applying to the best internships they can find as a way of packing their resume and refining their interests. But what if you don’t get your top choice for an internship? Or even your second choice? Or third? Or fourth? Or you don’t find any career-oriented jobs? Well, not much happens. You’d find a job scooping ice cream or you’d just chill at home. Then, you’d find another internship another summer or enter the workforce and work your way up through a job. You’ve got a Harvard degree. And that degree, combined with talent, means that you can do a lot of things, regardless of any missed internship opportunities.
The same goes for comping any prestigious organization with connections to a certain industry. In the long run, your degree and your talent will win out. For now, the missed “connections” and resume-padding don’t really matter.
The examples go on. Does it really matter, in the long run, how fast you can row a boat on a river somewhere? Does it really matter, in the long run, if you get a certain part in a play in the Loeb Ex (wherever or whatever that is)? Does it really matter, in the long run, whether your Crimson columns are good or complete crap?
At this point in our lives, we must recognize that we are still in a coddled, constructed environment. We are isolated from the world, and we have little impact on anything outside of these gates.
One day, what we do will matter. For now though, it doesn’t. And that’s a beautiful thing. Because stress is, largely, an artificial construction. The next test you bomb, the next internship you miss, and the next comp you fail: It doesn’t matter. And because of that, thankfully, you’ll know what to do when the stakes are higher.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two weeks ago, a group of Harvard College students launched Renegade, a magazine that seeks to provide an outlet for students of color on Harvard’s campus. This past week, the Crimson reported that several posters parodying the publication had been posted in Pforzheimer House. The House Masters subsequently issued a statement condemning the fake posters, while also indicating their intention to remove the satirical posters.
Sadly, these specific posters distract from the broader issue at hand. Renegade’s existence demonstrates a problem with the nature of our conversation on the ever-present and important issues of race, gender, and class.  If members of our Harvard community feel so alienated from it, we should and must all be horrified. Especially in light of recent events, including the ongoing national conversation about police violence, having an inclusive campus discussion is critical. As a community, there is no choice but to move forward in our quest to eradicate the scourges of racial injustice, gender-based discrimination, and classism. In this, Renegade represents a positive and potentially transformative force.
Unfortunately, the parody posters had a negative impact on this discussion.  Instead of helping to move the conversation forward, they made an already divisive issue more contentious. These posters seemed to mock the topics that are central to Renegade—issues about the sometimes uncomfortable realities concerning race and Harvard. These are too sensitive to satirize, but more importantly, they are too critical to mock.
Yet once the posters were up, the Pforzheimer House Masters’ choice to call for their removal was wrong. Just as mockery inhibits productive debate, so too does censorship; simply erasing abhorrent viewpoints does not solve the underlying problem. Threatening to remove the posters did not generate a productive, inclusive, and meaningful conversation on race. When opposing views are not permitted, the discussion simply stalls. If we disagree—as we do—with the content of these satirical posters, then the response should be to make this a teachable moment, to seize this opportunity to start a better dialogue.
Censorship should never be the answer. Running a publication requires openness to criticism. It should be expected that some would disagree; and that disagreement should serve as a basis for discussion. To say that satire of a magazine “personally hurt[s]” the writers is a dangerous precedent, even given the unquestionably sensitive issues at hand—the role of Harvard House Masters is not to determine what views are allowed. It is true that Renegade represents a more marginalized view than its critics; it is also true that the principle of free expression does not apply only to those in the margins.
On race, as with any issue, persuasion should trump censorship and discussion should trump accusation. This is a lesson that both the Pforzheimer House Masters and Renegade’s critics would do well to learn.  As our campus and our country navigate seemingly intractable divisions over skin color, socioeconomic status, and gender identity, it will be conversations and community that win the day, not thought policing or accusations of radicalism by one side and racism by the other.  To paraphrase a misattribution of Voltaire, we may disapprove of these posters, but we strongly defend their right to be posted.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Renegade, the new art and advocacy collective founded and run by Harvard students of color, dominated the campus dialogue as soon as they launched last week. With some students praising the group for providing a platform on which students of color can openly express themselves and others denouncing the magazine as divisive and offensive, the content, mission, and advertising campaign of Renegade were all heavily scrutinized.
However, regardless of which side of these debates you fall on, the very fact that Renegade’s launch caused such furor can help explain why so many students felt the need to found the magazine (and collective). If Harvard students of color attempting to speak their mind—and creating an advertising campaign designed to publicize this mission—can cause as much backlash as it has, it is pretty clear the student body at large has not been adequately exposed to their perspective.
Harvard students of color deserve a platform on which they can openly speak their minds about the issues that affect their lives without feeling as though they somehow need to filter their message or fit their prose into the style of one of Harvard’s older, more traditional and white-washed publications. Renegade can become that space.
Of course, as with the launch of any publication, some of Renegade’s individual content might not have been as effective as it could have been, and may even have led a segment of Harvard’s student body to become more actively antagonistic to the mission it puts forth. But that’s the point. Even if it’s still a little bit messy in some respects, Renegade has caused thousands of members of the Harvard community to read and have opinions on the work of students of color. And even if some of these reactions have been negative, the fact that there are reactions represents a mark of progress; Renegade, to use a cliché, has given a voice to the voiceless.
For this reason, getting caught up in the various micro-controversies surrounding the magazine’s launch (on specific articles, fake posters in Pforzheimer House, the ban of said posters, etc.) is beyond petty; in truth, it’s regressive. Ultimately, Renegade is about far more than the words that make up its digital pages, and its founding is just one step in the fight to radically alter the experience of Harvard’s students of color—an experience defined at least in part by the organizations and publications that dictate the campus discourse.
In this way, Renegade has proven the need to reexamine the identity of all of Harvard’s publications—from newspapers to literary magazines—that were founded by, and, in many cases, are still run by predominantly white students.
As Harvard’s most visible student publication, The Crimson needs to use Renegade’s launch as an opportunity to take a closer look at ourselves—to continue our mission of making The Crimson more diverse in staff and in content, to advocate for other campus publications to do the same, and to become a part of the renegade rather than just one of the countless reasons it came to exist.

Your editorial entitled “Title IX and University Administration” argues the importance of uniform Title IX procedures across “One Harvard."  Uniformity in some matters is good, but you do not say why it is needed for this one.
The reason the law faculty drafted its own procedures was the overwhelming sentiment in our faculty that the university’s Title IX procedures were so unfair as to be unacceptable.  At our meetings not a single faculty member spoke in defense of the university’s procedures. And, after all, procedure is what we do. If we had not been allowed to draft our own procedures a strong denunciation by the faculty would almost certainly have followed and would have made law suits by accused students a virtual certainty. (Indeed, early in the discussions twenty-eight of our colleagues did denounce the procedures in an op-ed in The Boston  Globe). Our HLS alternative procedures were overwhelmingly adopted by the law faculty.
The broader lesson relates to the university's governance structure and the absence of faculty participation in the creation of the central administration's standards. In spite of vague talk of review by “the schools” and reference to some unidentified “working groups,” the fact is that the university’s Title IX procedures were drafted without a single law professor's or assistant professor’s active participation. We have done the university a favor, and if the rest of the university takes up our procedures that would be all to the good.
Had there been a representative faculty senate, that senate could have insured faculty participation in the creation of these new regulatory standards.

The men and women who have been our guests at the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter–our nearest neighbors–have suffered a lot this winter.
Even as temperatures and spirits rise, it seems proper to pause and solemnly regard the winter past.
Last October, the shelter on Long Island, which housed several hundreds of people, was suddenly shut down. Other shelters, including ours, strained to accommodate the unusually vast need. Triage was even crueller than usual. Tempers flared, even in the gentlest souls. Mental health faltered. The colds and flus made their rounds.
It was a long winter.
There is something unfair about it all. It is unfair that every night we returned to our warm dorm rooms while they froze. It is unfair that even the laziest of us will be showered with bright opportunities for the future, while they work bloody hard to get out of homelessness and yet are treated as subhuman because they don't have addresses. It is unfair that when we make mistakes or get unlucky, it costs us little, while if they make mistakes or get unlucky, it costs them everything.
And God’s in His heaven.
The Christian says that God is good and powerful and all-knowing and cares about us. So why doesn't God eliminate unjust suffering? Why does he stand by silently? This problem has vexed Christian thinkers for as long as there has been Christianity.
Some have said that the existence of unjust suffering logically disproves the existence of the Christian God. It turns out to be surprisingly hard to make these charges stick. Then again, the logical solutions are not very satisfying either. Perhaps the problem of unjust suffering is just not a problem of logic. It is a different sort of problem, a first-personal, existential problem.
“What is all this suffering for?” It seems to me that this is the real question asked by the suffering heart, if it can move beyond sheer anger at God into something like a gentle melancholy.
“Does my suffering matter to God?” If only I could be sure that it were in aid of something, I might not even demand my suffering should be fair. I might even voluntarily choose to suffer, if some good would come of it in the long term for the world or for my children or for others whom I love.
But so much suffering seems completely pointless.
So we are back to the question: Why?
The book of Job, which is the Bible's most extended treatment of the problem of suffering, suggests that if God has morally sufficient reasons for permitting unjust suffering to occur, we may just be in the dark as to what those reasons are. There, God's answer to Job's complaint is, “Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth?”
But that's hardly an answer, is it?
Christianity does not solve the problem of unjust suffering. But Christianity does remain uniquely committed to the problem of suffering as a mystery of our life and existence, demanding our faith and our hope.
Here is the idea. Maybe suffering doesn't make sense because it's like one of those paintings that don't make sense.
As I write, I am looking at one of Paul Signac's pointillist paintings of the harbor at Marseille. I observe that there are a lot of mustard-yellow blobs in the middle of what is presumably the sea. Maybe they represent the sunlight on the waves or something. But then what are the lavender blobs supposed to be? And the red blobs are completely inexcusable. This sea, I think to myself, is full of blobs. It is all blobs and no sea. What an exceedingly defective painting.
Only, when you stand back, it actually looks rather good.
I like pointillist paintings because they capture the fragmentation of life, the sense that life is a drawer full of odd socks. Within the madness, within the ugliness, within the suffering, our hope may yet hang on the big picture, which we do not yet see.
In this same vein, think of how discord is used in a piece of music to tell a bigger story. In the end, somehow, the awful noise may yet resolve into an unexpected harmony. Musical people may be able to sense that a resolution is coming. Yet our location within the unfolding drama of the music is always in media res. No one can know ahead of time how the piece will end.
In the Christian story, sorrow will be “redeemed.” This is God's promise, no more and no less.
When we say in common English that a person has “redeemed” herself, we don't mean that she has erased the past. Rather, her earlier actions are recontextualized or reevaluated in light of her later ones. In the light of the whole story, even the memory of the past is transformed.
Christianity does not offer an answer to the problem of suffering, but it does offer two things. One is a present imperative, a call-to-arms, to imitate Jesus Christ in the terrible, beautiful, transformative mission of suffering for others' sake. The other is the future hope of seeing the winter of our suffering redeemed and transformed. It is the hope of spring.
Et gloria in excelsis Deo.

UPDATED: April 13, 2015, at 5:16 a.m.
Members and supporters of the activist group Divest Harvard began a planned blockade of three entrances to Massachusetts Hall on Sunday and were still rallying outside the building in protest of Harvard’s investment in fossil fuel companies late that evening.
At least 150 protesters had gathered in front of Mass. Hall by 8:50 p.m. on Sunday for a round of addresses and chants in front of the main entrance to the building, which houses the offices of top Harvard officials including University President Drew G. Faust. Some protesters held a long banner with the words “Heat Week,” the name for Divest Harvard’s planned week of protests, and blue neon signs that read “Divest from fossil fuels.” Others, carrying large backpacks, provisions, and tents, settled down near the entrances and pulled out their laptops, preparing for a long stay.
Around 9:15 p.m., Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana was seen near Mass. Hall speaking with protesters.
At the rally, climate activists, many of whom were accessorized in neon orange scarves, buttons, and headbands, sang protest songs in support of the students blocking the Mass. Hall doors. Protest leaders including environmental activist Bill E. McKibben ’82, the leader of the environmental group 350.org and a former Crimson president, and former Colorado Sen. Tim Wirth spoke to the crowd, encouraging the members to support the blockade throughout the week.
The protesters are demanding that Harvard divest its $35.9 billion endowment from fossil fuel companies. Divest Harvard organizers have said “hundreds” of activists are willing to be arrested in the effort.
“Climate change is moving quickly, and we need action now,” McKibben said in an interview after his brief address. “[The protest] is a chance for us to remind Harvard to do more than talk.”
The first round of protesters made their way to the entrances of the central office building at about 7:30 p.m., when the group’s co-coordinator, Talia K. Rothstein ’17, and three other members walked by Harvard University Police Department officers at the front door, exchanged some pleasantries, and leaned against the main entrance.
From the start of the blockade, protesters interacted civilly with a growing number of HUPD officers, who originally prevented residents of Mass. Hall, which houses some freshman bedrooms, from entering their dormitory. Shortly after the blockade began, a few students were kept from entering Mass. Hall dorm rooms for around 15 minutes, when freshman resident dean for Ivy Yard Michael C. Ranen arrived and cleared their entrances with HUPD officers.
“My residents need to be able to get in and out as needed anytime,” Ranen said to a group of officers and protesters in front of Mass. Hall A Entryway. A few minutes later, another student tried to enter the building and could not do so immediately. Ranen added in an interview that he will come back to Mass. Hall as needed to make sure that freshmen may come and go from their rooms as they please.
“The agreement is we’re going to co-share the space,” HUPD Sergeant Daniel Brown said to Divest Harvard members, who verbally agreed.
The day began long before the protesters took their posts at Mass. Hall. The group announced plans for “Heat Week” in February and made plans for the blockade public last week. On Sunday at 4 p.m., nearly 50 Divest Harvard members and affiliates, including members from 350.org, gathered at the First Parish in Cambridge to go over the plans for the week and guidelines for their civil disobedience, which included not using physical or verbal violence, carrying weapons, or destroying property.
The protesters were also briefed about interacting with the police and the risk of arrest. Lee D. Goldstein, a lawyer at the Massachusetts Defense Committee of the National Lawyer’s Guild, has said the guild will represent anyone who is arrested at the blockade.
Divest Harvard was founded in 2012 and has, in the last year, increasingly turned to tactics of civil disobedience. Last May, Divest Harvard member Brett A. Roche ’15 was arrested, but not charged, when he prevented a Harvard employee from entering Mass. Hall during a blockade of the building.

The Harvard Graduate School of Education has raised $145 million in its capital campaign, amounting to 58 percent of its goal of $250 million, according to Daphne Layton, the Ed School's senior associate dean for development and alumni relations.
This sum is comprised of more than 10,000 individual donor gifts and pledges, including a $5 million donation from the Walton Family Foundation in November 2014, Layton said. The Ed School has raised about $34 million since its campaign publicly launched in September last year.
In addition to financially supporting priorities like the Harvard Teacher Fellows program, which is designed to recruit Harvard undergraduates to teaching, and the Usable Knowledge project, which aims to make research more accessible, Layton said that a large portion of the money raised in the capital campaign will be distributed towards funding financial aid endowments, fellowships, and faculty chairs.
Over the past decade, Ed School alumni have contributed 80 to 90 percent of the total number of campaign donations, but their contributions have amounted to an average of 5 percent of the total funds raised, according to Layton. The reality that professionals in the education field have relatively modest salaries and donate within their means is an important consideration for campaign efforts, Layton said.
“It’s a very salient issue,” Layton said. “It’s a population that… on average, doesn’t have the same kind of profile in terms of wealth and assets as graduates from some of the other [Harvard] schools.”
However, alumni from other Harvard schools have made considerably large donations to the Ed School that have benefitted its campaign progress, and Layton said she attributed the notable contributions from Harvard non-GSE alumni to University President Drew G. Faust’s commonly-touted vision of “One Harvard.”
“‘Every tub on its own bottom’ is great in many ways,” said Layton, “but we could do more…to tip the balance a little bit back, to encourage donors from some of the wealthier schools to be thinking about other parts of Harvard.”
Layton said Harvard Business School alumni are particularly interested in donating to the Ed School due to increasing levels of collaboration between the schools, as well as the close relationship between Ed School Dean James E. Ryan and Business School Dean Nitin Nohria. In addition, Ralph M. James, the executive director of external relations at the Business School, co-chairs the Ed School’s capital campaign.
James wrote in an email that Business School alumni are compelled to donate to causes with strong leadership and clear purpose, and he called Ryan “an extraordinary leader.”
“I have seen it time and again in talking with HBS alumni—when they see an opportunity to make a difference, to do something that matters, they step up and do the best job they can,” James wrote. “HGSE is uniquely positioned to prepare the education innovators of the future and to deliver research that is relevant to practice so that all young people have access to education that works.”
However, the Ed School has faced some challenges in raising money for the campaign that are endemic to the field, Layton said. She pointed to current national tensions surrounding education reform, which have politicized views about teacher training at education schools and have resulted in a reluctance among potential donors.
“Many of the people who have a lot of money who care about education... have a worldview that ed schools by-and-large are not a part of the solution. They’re part of the problem,” Layton said. “We have to swim against that tide, and we have to kind of make the argument that we’re a different kind of school, we’re a very high-quality school, and also that we’re not affiliated with one ideology or another.”
The capital campaign has a University-wide public goal of raising $6.5 billion.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 13, 2015, at 1:24 a.m.
The Undergraduate Council at its general meeting on Sunday voted down a piece of legislation that would have allowed activist group Divest Harvard to publicize its “Heat Week” events scheduled for this week through the UC’s email list.
The act, which was proposed by Zachary W. Popp ’15, would have allowed Divest Harvard to send a “maximum of two emails” on Sunday, April 12 and Wednesday, April 15 over the Council’s “UC Pub” mail merge. The mail merge is currently received by all undergraduates.
According to it supporters, the act was not meant to be an endorsement of Divest Harvard or informative of the Council’s stance on the group’s mission or protest methods. Divest Harvard, which advocates for divesting Harvard's endowment from fossil fuels, blockaded administrative building Massachusetts Hall on Sunday evening and plans to continue the protest until Friday.
In October 2014, the UC passed legislation that collaborated with Divest Harvard, creating a “Divestment Task Force” amongst the UC, and advocated for a “set of action items in collaboration with the leaders of the Divest Harvard.” The legislation, sponsored by now-UC Vice President Dhruv P. Goyal ’16 and Chloe S. Maxmin ’15 of Divest Harvard, referenced the results of a fall 2012 UC referendum when 72 percent of undergraduates who voted on the referendum indicated that they would support “Harvard divesting its endowment from the fossil fuel industry.”
The emails, according to Winthrop House representative Daniel R. Levine ’17, would be primarily “informative” and would not contain opinionated information. Levine is a Crimson news writer.
“[The UC’s mail merge] is simply a venue to reach a larger part of the student body,” said Popp, a UC representative from Dudley House. “[The members of Divest Harvard] also want to find supporters that have interest in Divest Harvard, but don’t know much about it.”
Representatives responded by saying that Divest’s presence on the mail merge would be “implicit” support of the student group. Others opposed the act because they felt that this particular use of the mail merge would display unfair publicity preference to Divest Harvard, as opposed to other student groups with equally important events.
“I think it sets a dangerous precedent for us to open our pubbing list to any student group in theory,” Council parliamentarian Jacob R. Steinberg-Otter ’16 said.
“I believe in climate change. I support, in some ways, divestment, but I do not support the group Divest Harvard,” Student Initiatives Committee Chair Daniel V. Banks ’17 added. “I think they’re militant, and I don’t think we should be putting our name on a thing that sued the University.”
The act was voted down with 27 votes cast in opposition.
Also at the meeting, the Council passed an act to allocate $1,500 from the College’s “Bridging and Belonging” grant towards multiple events during reading period that aim to alleviate stress and increase overall student mental health. The “mental health event series” is targeted to reading period where “discourse surrounding campus mental health is perhaps most needed,” according to the legislation. The event series will include a movie screening, a community-wide study break, a student panel, and four community dinners.
The act was passed with unanimous consent, with an amendment that allowed the Council’s Student Initiatives Committee to purchase T-shirts, mugs, movie tickets, and gift cards to give away at the events. According to numerous representatives, the Bridging and Belonging Grant as well as the UC’s Finance Committee cannot fund gift items such as these.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following a campaign of more than two years that included demonstrations, a strike, and a boycott, workers at the Soldiers Field Road DoubleTree Hotel, a Hilton Hotels enterprise housed in a building owned by Harvard, have organized with the UNITE HERE! Local 26 union, according to workers and union representatives.
On Friday, an arbitrator verified with both union and hotel management that a majority of the hotel’s workers had voted in favor of unionization, according to Local 26 president Brian Lang.
Spokespeople for Hilton Hotels and Resorts did not respond to requests for comment over the weekend. Jeff Neal, a Harvard spokesperson, wrote that the University is “pleased that the two parties have agreed to a process that will determine the issue of unionization at the DoubleTree Hotel.”
Lang praised the outcome.
“Because of the courage of the workers, going on strike back in November, calling a boycott of their own hotel, with constant vigilance, they won,” he said.
The organization comes more than two years after DoubleTree workers petitioned hotel management in March of 2013 for the right to vote on unionization through a fair process vote, which the workers argued was more conducive to their work schedules.
Local 26 also represents Harvard dining hall workers, as well as Boston-area hotel staff.
“Our expectation is that the workers at the Harvard’s DoubleTree Hotel will get the same wage, benefits, and work-rules standard as every other hotel worker in our union,” Lang said.
Members of Local 26 and workers officially announced that they had successfully unionized on Saturday evening in the Lowell House Junior Common Room. Among the crowd who gathered for the announcement were members of Harvard's Student Labor Action Movement, which has organized numerous protests and demonstrations in support of the unionization movement since its outset.
“It’s been our role as students with a fair amount of privilege and security to call out Harvard and remind the university that they are ultimately responsible for what goes on at the hotel,” said Nina R. Wagner ’18, a member of SLAM who has been active in the DoubleTree movements and helped to organize a November protest that drew hundreds of demonstrators. “We’ve been helping them strengthen their voices in terms of asking for a union.”
Workers at the event said inclusion in the union would have a positive impact on their work environment.
“I feel amazing and everyone feels like we really got this done,” said Delmy A. Lemus, a DoubleTree worker. “We are finally going to get respect and be treated like humans at work.”
“Today is the most important day, after two years of working, because now we know we have more respect, we can talk to the managers,” said Victor Bernabe, who has worked at the DoubleTree for 11 years.

Promoting his new book “The Most Good You Can Do,” philosopher Peter A. D. Singer spoke about the philosophy behind effective altruism and ways to give to charity that would maximize the common good to a packed auditorium at the Science Center on Sunday.
Open to the public, the event was a part of Harvard’s first Effective Altruism Week, which runs from April 12 to 17, organized by Harvard College Effective Altruism and co-sponsored by the Harvard Philosophy Department.
Singer said people can create positive change in the world by effectively allocating their resources.
“People think the problem is so big that they can’t make a difference, I think that’s a mistake,” he said.
Introduced as “one of the most influential living philosophers in the most positive way” by Psychology professor Joshua D. Greene, Singer advocated for donating money to the most efficient charities working today.
“We only have a certain amount of funds, the real choice is what we have to do with those funds,” he said.
As an example of an ineffective donation, Singer criticised David Geffen’s recent gift of $100 million to New York’s Lincoln Center. He said the money would be more effectively spent, for example, preventing or curing blindness to most effectively improve the lives of others.
Harvard College Effective Altruism Co-President Angie Jo ’16 said the organization invited Singer to speak because of his status as prominent role in the movement of effective altruism.
“He has become famous for this notion that normal people can make more rigorous decisions to actually change the amount of good they do in the world,” she said.
Singer said that of the annual billions of individual donations made each year, most are poorly researched.
In order to address this lack of knowledge, he pointed to organizations such as GiveWell, a nonprofit that evaluates charities’ effectiveness per dollar spent. He said such evaluators should be the “first stop to go when looking for effective charities.”
He also held his former student Matt Wage, a Princeton math and philosophy major, as a model for effective altruism. Rather than attend Oxford for postgraduate study, Wage decided to work in New York City at an arbitrage-trading firm. After his first year of work, he donated over $100,000 to charity.
“I didn’t know about effective altruism before this event, but I’ve always questioned about how I can do good and to humanity overall, it was a good opportunity to think about this idea,” Kun-Woo R. Kim said after attending the event.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture is investigating the Harvard-run New England Primate Medical Research Center after six monkeys transferred to the Oregon Zoo last May died soon after arriving.
The investigation, reported on Friday by The Boston Globe, is the newest incident involving the primate center, which has also come under fire for more than a dozen other monkey deaths on its Southborough campus since 1999. The most recent inquiry involves the transport of nine cotton-top tamarin primates to Oregon in late May. Six of the animals died two days after arriving at the zoo.
Medical School spokesperson David Cameron declined to give an on-the-record statement, but provided in an email a general statement that he attributed to Harvard Medical School.
“We were deeply saddened to learn about the unfortunate event at the Oregon Zoo related to the cotton top tamarins,” it says. The statement went on to suggest that the animals had not died because of their treatment during the trip.
“The standard and safest method of transporting nonhuman primates in North America is through experienced ground carriers. The carrier is registered with the USDA, and it provided environmentally controlled, door-to-door transportation that met all USDA guidelines,” it continues. “In accordance with the Animal Welfare Act, the animals were observed every four hours during transit, and were provided fresh produce, water and food at intervals that met USDA regulations.”
Operated by the Medical School and affiliated with the National Institutes of Health, the New England Primate Medical Research Center once housed 2,000 monkeys. As it ramped down its efforts, 1,493 primates were scheduled to be sent from Harvard to other facilities by January 2015, according to documents released by the National Institutes of Health after a Freedom of Information Request made by the Harvard Law School Student Animal Legal Defense Fund and the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, which shared the documents with The Crimson. The center is set to shut down at the end of May.

The No. 63 Harvard women’s tennis team hosted its first two Ivy League matches of the 2015 campaign this weekend. But the friendly confines of the Beren Tennis Center provided the Crimson (7-9, 0-4 Ivy) with the same results as last weekend—consecutive 5-2 losses—this time to Penn (8-8, 1-4) and No. 53 Princeton (11-7, 5-0).
This is the first time in coach Traci Green’s eight-year tenure that the team has begun Ivy League play 0-4. In addition, after playing first singles in Harvard’s first two conference matches, freshman Nikki Kallenerg was unable to play this weekend due to injury. The Crimson’s seven Ivy League singles victories this season have come from five different players.
“Everyone’s been contributing,” freshman Ellen Jang-Milsten said. “There’s always someone else who’s ready to step up and have a good day. The team has been strong and very flexible, willing to do [its] part.”
PRINCETON 5, HARVARD 2
The Tigers remained undefeated in Ivy League play with their win on Sunday. The victory was the ninth consecutive for Princeton over Harvard.
The Crimson captured its first doubles point of the Ivy League season by taking two out of three from the Tigers. Junior Amy He and Jang-Milsten fell on court two, but the duo of sophomore Monica Lin and rookie Annika Ringblom prevailed, 8-6, as did sophomore June Lee and junior Amanda Lin, 8-5.
Despite the hot start, the team was only able to pick up one more victory on the day, getting outscored in singles action, 5-1. Ringblom picked up the only singles win of the day, winning 6-2, 6-3 at the second singles position. It was the freshman’s second victory of her Ivy League career.
“Princeton is tough,” Lee said. “We knew we had to bounce back from [Saturday]. We came out super pumped and energetic and won the doubles point. They have some tough players. We’re right there with all these schools, so we’re just looking to be resilient and stay positive and hopefully win our next three matches.”
Amanda Lin had the longest singles match of the day, falling 1-6, 6-4, 5-6 (3) to senior Katie Goepel. Monica Lin was the only other Crimson player to take her opponent to a third set. The sophomore fell to Princeton captain Lindsay Graff, the No. 119 player in the country, 0-6, 7-5, 1-6. Lee, Jang-Milsten, and He each fell in straight sets.
PENN 5, HARVARD 2
Harvard dropped its third 5-2 Ivy League match on Saturday afternoon. It was the first home conference match for the Crimson and the team’s first home outdoor match of the season.
After losing the all-important doubles point, Harvard’s top three players all fell to Quakers. Monica Lin, playing at the first singles position for the first time in her Crimson career, fell to Penn senior Agustina Sol Eskenazi, 0-6, 6-4, 3-6.
Then after dropping a first-set tiebreaker, Ringblom dropped the second singles match to sophomore Kana Daniel. Lee also fell in straight sets, 4-6, 0-6, to junior Sonya Latycheva. In the day’s closest match, Quaker freshman Ria Vaidya bested Harvard’s five-player, He, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4.
“I think it came down to making adjustments, having to deal with the wind, [and] who made better shot selections,” Lee said. “Everyone fought really, and that’s all we can really do.”
Jang-Milsten took the tiebreaker in her first set before cruising to a straight set victory over Lina Qostal. The victory was Jang-Milsten’s first in Ivy League action. Amanda Lin took a three-set victory from Penn senior Alexandra Ion. The West Chester, Ohio, native teamed up with Lee to pick up Harvard’s only doubles victory.
Monica Lin and Ringblom fell to Eskenazi and Latycheva, while Jang-Milsten and He were downed by Daniel and Vaidya.
“One thing we definitely need to work on is coming out more confident, being more aggressive in the beginning, and having a good start,” Lee said. “The other team will feel that [pressure].”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s volleyball team entered this weekend with a pair of possibilities—the chance of marring Penn State’s unblemished conference record on one day and solidifying a playoff position on the next with a win over St. Francis.
Despite displaying short stretches dominant performances, the Crimson (11-11, 5-5 EIVA) failed to achieve either objective, losing to the Nittany Lions (15-9, 9-0) and the Red Flash (6-17, 4-5) in two tightly contested matches.
ST. FRANCIS 3, HARVARD 1
Stop me if you’ve heard this one before: a cellar dweller and a potential title contender walk into a gym in the middle of Pennsylvania.
On paper, Saturday’s contest between second-to-last St. Francis and second-place Harvard may have sounded like a joke, but the Red Flash preempted any laughter, downing the Crimson 3-1 after initially going up, 2-0.
“Defensively [it was] probably not the best match,” co-captain Caleb Zimmick said. “Serving too. Those are a couple of things that were within our control and parts that we didn’t execute.”
The result complicated the EIVA playoff picture, as the four schools battling for the final three postseason spots are now within a one-game range.
On Saturday, St. Francis dominated on the defensive end, building a 14-9 block advantage.
Even so, Harvard mounted a comeback in the third frame when the Crimson fended off a pair of match points to claim the set, 28-26.
In the fourth game, the Red Flash returned the favor. After a seesawing sequence handed the visitors a 23-22 advantage, St. Francis won three consecutive points to take the contest.
The Red Flash built a 2-0 lead thanks largely to opposite Mike Marshman, who racked up 12 kills without committing an error on the afternoon. Nine of these finishes came in the first two sets, which St. Francis took, 25-23 and 25-22.
“Any team in our conference can beat any other team on any given day,” said junior outside hitter Branden Clemens. “We always need to make sure to play our hardest…. Every match counts toward making the conference playoffs.”
PENN STATE 3, HARVARD 2
Friday night, on the home court of league-leading Penn State, only seven points separated Harvard from a historic result.
Midway through the fourth set, the Crimson held an 18-13 lead, a 2-1 set advantage, and the opportunity to claim a win on the Nittany Lions’ home court for the first time ever.
But Penn State, winner of 16 straight EIVA championships and 17 straight conference matches, had no desire to halt the trend.
Thanks to a 12-3 run, the Nittany Lions salvaged the set, 25-21. Then, in the tiebreaking game, Penn State won eight of the first nine points en route to a 15-10 victory.
“We’re definitely disappointed as a whole,” Zimmick said. “There were certain points where we weren’t able to convert offensively, which was partly due to our inability and partly due to their defense.”
In the second and third sets, however, it was Harvard that pulled the decisive punches.
Clinging on to a 20-19 advantage in the second set, the Crimson put together a 5-1 streak to tie the game score at one-apiece. One frame later, Harvard repeated the trick, responding to a 22-21 deficit by winning five of the last seven points.
“They’re a great serving team, and we were handling their serves well,” Zimmick said. “Especially in the games we won, we did not allow them to get on any service runs.”
The first set consisted of a similar narrative, albeit with a different result. After the two teams battled to an 18-all deadlock, the Nittany Lions won five straight points and eventually took the frame, 25-20.
Throughout the night, Penn State’s Aaron Russell verified his All-American status by finishing with a game-high 26 kills and three service aces.
“We need to figure out how to close,” Clemens said. “It was very positive that we could hang with them and even take the lead…. Now we just need that last little push.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After an NCAA-best 32 goals this season, Jimmy Vesey finally got his hat trick.
The junior scoring specialist for the Harvard men’s ice hockey team signed autographs, posed for photos, and held babies before the Hobey Baker Award ceremony at Matthews Arena on Friday.
The festivities recognized Vesey as a member of the 2015 “Hobey Hat Trick”—one of three finalists for college hockey’s highest individual honor—alongside North Dakota junior goaltender Zane McIntyre and the evening’s eventual winner, Boston University freshman forward Jack Eichel.
The event also announced Vesey as a first team All-American selection—the Crimson’s first since Alex Killorn ’12 and Danny Biega ’13 in 2012 and its 29th all-time.
The honors capped an eventful month for the Charlestown native, who still has yet to score three goals in a single collegiate game.
He swept the ECAC Player of the Year and Player of the Tournament awards and scored twice in the conference final on March 21 to lead Harvard to its first ECAC title since 2006. That week he topped Eichel for the 63rd annual Walter Brown Award, given to the top American-born college ice hockey player in New England.
The next Friday, Vesey was Harvard’s lone goal-scorer in a 4-1 loss to Nebraska-Omaha in the first round of the NCAA tournament, finishing his season with five more goals than the next highest-scoring Division I player. Days later, Vesey announced his intention to return to Harvard for his senior year after speculation that he would leave to sign with the NHL’s Nashville Predators.
And just last Tuesday, USA Today reported that Vesey will play for Team USA at the International Ice Hockey Federation World Championship in Prague, Czech Republic, in the beginning of May.
On Friday, Vesey addressed the report, saying that he is waiting for approval from Harvard’s Administrative Board to take his exams in the Czech Republic. As a freshman, Vesey took his first semester exams in Ufa, Russia, where he helped Team USA to a gold medal in the World Junior Championships.
“It’s kind of still up in the air a bit,” Vesey said. “We need to hear back from [the Ad Board]...so I am hoping to get that confirmed. I think it will be a great experience.”
Nearly all of Vesey’s teammates sat in the arena stands during the event next to a strong contingent of Boston University fans, who cheered after the announcement of Eichel’s Hobey win.
Eichel, who paced the nation with 71 points this season, was the first freshman to accept the award since 1993. The Chelmsford, Mass., native led the Terriers to Saturday’s national final at TD Garden, where BU surrendered a late lead to fall to Providence, 4-3.
Among the first to congratulate Eichel on the award stage was Vesey, who would have been Harvard’s fourth Hobey Baker winner and first since Lane MacDonald ’88-89. Vesey is the Crimson’s first Hat Trick finalist—a designation started in 2013—and Harvard’s first top-10 finalist since 2005.
Eichel now faces a similar decision to the one Vesey faced two weeks ago. The freshman is expected to be a top-two pick in the upcoming NHL Entry Draft this June.
While many observers expect him to sign a professional contract this summer, Eichel sees value in the route that Vesey has chosen.
“Obviously, [Vesey] would have had an opportunity to go to Nashville and play right away, but he also has a chance to get a degree from Harvard,” Eichel said on Friday. “A lot of people have given me advice that I’m sure Jimmy got as well. There’s no rush to go anywhere. Enjoy yourself, and live in the moment.”
Vesey is enjoying himself but looking ahead. After Prague, he will set course for Tampa, Fla.—the site of the 2016 Frozen Four.
“I think we think as a team that we could have been at the Frozen Four this weekend, so we’re just going to try to come back bigger, stronger, and faster,” Vesey said. “We definitely hope to be in Tampa next spring.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After weeks of preparing for the NEISA Team Race Championship, the Harvard sailing team finished the weekend with a fifth place finish, falling short of a bid to nationals by one race. In addition, contingents competing at the Mystic Lake Team Race and Emily Wick Trophy took home fifth and 18th, respectively.
NEISA TEAM RACE CHAMPIONSHIP – FOWLE TROPHY
Coming off of a slew of second place finishes, the No. 9 Crimson fell short at the conference championship, sailing in FJs. Representing Harvard were freshman Kevin Coakley, sophomore Julia Lord, juniors Andrew Molerus, Jacob Bradt, Sydney Karnovsky, and Marek Zaleski, and seniors Brian Drumm, Michael Drumm, and Gram Slattery.
The 10-8 finish earned the host Crimson fifth place in the field of 12 teams.
The race schedule consisted of two rounds: the first with all 12 teams, with the top eight moving onto the second. In the first round, Harvard thrived, beating a slew of opponents, including No. 1 Yale.
However, the second round provided Harvard with less success as the team dropped five of its seven races.
The day’s top performance came from No. 3 Boston College, who was followed by No. 8 Roger Williams, Yale, and No. 5 Tufts. The pool proved to be filled with tough competition, as Connecticut College was the only team to enter the contest unranked.
Other perils came with the weather. Saturday brought gusts up to 25 knots, resulting in a broken shroud and some bent masts. Conversely, the next day saw light winds of 2-8 knots.
MYSTIC LAKE TEAM RACE
Another Crimson squad took the short trek to Tufts. Harvard finished fifth of 10 teams with a 3-5 record, sailing in larks.
One of the biggest challenges of the regatta proved to be the weather. Gusts on Saturday caused frequent capsizes and breakdowns.
“Our team thrived in the conditions,” freshman skipper Nick Sertl said. “We were the only team never to break a boat or to capsize.”
Coming into the regatta, the Crimson was determined to sail clean, consistent races. Sertl cited cohesive teamwork as a reason behind some of the team’s successful races.
“Strategically we wanted to stay focused and level-headed, starting every race without letting anything discouraging from the last one carry over,” freshman crew Ari Gross said.
One of Harvard’s key moments came against ranked opponent Roger Williams, who the team beat with boats coming in 1-2-6. Other successes came in the Crimson’s losses to BC and Brown, who placed 2nd and 4th, respectively. Despite losing the races, a Harvard boat crossed the line first in both cases.
The Crimson maintained the same lineup for the entirety of the weekend. The duos of Sertl and sophomore crew Nomin-Erdene Jagdagdorj, freshman skipper Dylan Farrell and Gross, and junior skipper Adam Brodheim and freshman crew Kirstin Anderson competed at the regatta.
Despite ending the weekend with a fifth place finish, the team is qualifying this regatta in other ways.
“Even though our win loss record wasn't great, there was definitely a lot to show for it,” Sertl said. “We were competitive in every race and were always making good plays.”
EMILY WICK TROPHY
An all-female contingent competed in the interconference regatta hosted by Coast Guard, racing in 420s and FJs. The squad finished in 18th, after dropping out of the B division races due to injuries.
The duo of freshman Taylor Ladd and junior Kristina Jakobson finished the A division races tied for 13th in 420s. Without a boat competing in the B division race, the team slipped to last place.
The pool of competition included teams from around the United States. The Crimson faced new competitors such as Wisconsin, Southern Florida, and Santa Clara. Ancient Eight rival Yale took first place for the third consecutive year.
The weather proved similar to that of the NEISA Championship, with gusts on Saturday and little to no wind on Sunday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
­The atmosphere felt like spring for the Harvard men’s and women’s heavyweight and lightweight crew teams as they raced on Saturday. Both men’s teams won their matches, while the women’s heavyweight team lost and the lightweight team came out on top.
The victory by the men’s heavyweight squad clinched another Stein Cup for the Crimson, while the Biglin Bowl and Knecht Cup were also won by Harvard. MEN’S CREW
It was another home win for the No. 4 men’s heavyweight team, which defeated No. 6 Brown and won its fifth-straight Stein Cup on Saturday. Overcoming a large head wind in the basin on the Charles, the Crimson bested the Bears in all five races.
The V8 team earned its 38th-straight victory—and 52 of the last 53 dual races—in its four-second win, finishing at 6:34.8. The JV team won by a wide margin, finishing its race in 6:26.41, while Brown came in over a minute later, crossing the finish line with a time of 7:34.4.
The freshman eight team, like the JV, finished with a sub-6:30 time, coming in at 6:29.2, nearly 10 seconds ahead of Brown’s freshmen eight team. The third and fourth varsity teams, along with the second freshman team, also posted victories in their races.
“It’s a pretty good day in the shed when every boat wins by open water, but we can always do better,” junior heavyweight Pat Dowling said. “I think Pat Lapage ‘12, who focuses on the lower boats, has done a really good job of creating more competition within the squad, bringing up the level of aggression in these boats. He’s the type of coach that guys really want to win for.”
The Biglin Bowl returned to the Charles, as the lightweight team hosted MIT and Dartmouth in its home opener. The Harvard team broke its split streak and earned a double win against the Big Green and the Engineers.
The varsity eight edged its cross-town rivals, spending much of the race neck-and-neck with MIT but finally nabbed the top spot with a time of 6:47.4. Dartmouth followed the two in open water.
The second, third, fourth varsity teams, and both novice teams had open water victories over their respective Big Green and Engineer opponents. WOMEN’S CREW
The No. 13 Radcliffe heavyweight crew dropped a close race against No. 4 Virginia, No. 8 Princeton, and Cornell on Lake Carnegie in Princeton, N.J. The team won against Cornell but was bested by UVA and Princeton.
The varsity eight lost the Class of 1975 Cup by just three seconds, coming in with a time of 6:57.6. This earned the team third place, behind the Cavaliers, which won the event and cup with a 6:54.5 split, and the Tigers, which crossed the finish line two seconds after the UVA boat.
The JV, third varsity, and varsity four A and B teams also placed third in their respective events. The second varsity team crossed the finish line eight seconds behind Princeton and 14 behind UVA. The varsity four C team, though losing to UVA by open water, came in second place.
The No. 2 lightweight team competed in the Knecht Cup for the first time in six years on Mercer Lake in West Windsor, N.J., and came away with the victory.
“We were really excited to use this weekend as an opportunity to get some more racing experience,” senior lightweight Taylor Garden said. “With some many different teams at this event, we were looking forward to the competitive racing.”
In the first round, the A team came in first place with a time of 6:38.54, finishing ahead of Princeton by two seconds. The B team finished fourth in its race at 6:49.21, five seconds behind first place finisher Boston University.
The two teams then went on to win their respective final races. The A team finished the Grand Final race in 6:49.14, just ahead of Princeton. The B team won the Petite Final with a time of 6:59.46.

­With both bragging rights and spots in the historic Harvard-Yale vs. Oxford-Cambridge meet on the line, the Harvard men’s and women’s track and field teams once again delivered over the rival Elis.
The women took home an eighth-consecutive victory over Yale with a score of 89.5 to 66.5, while the men captured their fifth-straight win over the Bulldogs, 99-62. The winner of each individual event was awarded the opportunity to compete versus the Ivy school’s British counterparts this summer, while the remaining slots will be at the coaches discretion.
“I thought the team competed well,” Crimson coach Jason Saretsky said. “It was good to come away with the double victory…it was great to see us take care of business.”Competing with strong winds throughout the day, the Crimson sprinters found the day to be a fruitful one.
On the women’s side, senior Danielle Barbian and co-captain Ashley Collinsworth placed first and seconds, respectively, in the 100 meter dash with times of 11.54 and 11.58. Collinsworth took home the 200 meter dash heat as well, clocking in at 24.37.
In the hurdles, sophomore Jackie Modesett took first in 100 meters with a time of 13.67, while junior Madison Hansen clocked in third at 14.59. Sophomore Jade Miller took home the 400 meter hurdles title with a 1:00.73 finish, over 11 seconds faster than her Yale counterpart.
The Harvard men exhibited their strength in the sprints as well, taking first through seventh in the 100 meter dash. Rookie Malcolm Johnson led the pack with a 10.50 finish, with junior David Gawlas and freshman Alexander Moore behind him at 10.82 and 10.83, respectively.
Rookie Matthew Hurst won the 200 meter heat with a time of 21.53, while co-captain Jarvis Harris posted a 14.23 mark to take home the 110 meter hurdles title. First-year Jay Hebert finished behind Jarvis with a personal best 14.47 finish, which was good enough for third.
The men also did damage in the relays, with Johnson, Hurst, Harris, and sophomore Efe Uwaifo teaming up to take the 4x100 relay title with a time of 41.63, the ninth-fastest time in Crimson history. In the 4x400 meter relay, Harris, Hurst, Moore, and Alex Kirby teamed up to claim the victory with a time of 3:30.59.
Harris, who took home three total first place accolades, was pleased with the results but believes there is still work to be done as the team looks towards the Outdoor Heptagonals in three weeks.
“I’m happy with the results…but they weren’t my best performances,” Harris said. “I’m happy, on one side, coming out with Harvard winning over Yale…there’s still improvement that can be made…we only have three meets until Heps, and we need to be at our best.”
On the women’s side, junior Christi Scott, Miller, junior Allison Morrison and Modesett teamed up in the 4x400 meter relay, finishing in first with a time of 3:45.00. The 4x100 meter team would be disqualified due to a botched handoff in the race.
In the distance portion, the women came through with strong performances as junior Paige Kouba took the 1,500 meter race with a time of 4:39.62, with sophomore Sarah Gillespie clocking in just behind her at 4:39.88. Senior Whitney Thornburg placed second in the 3,000 meter run with a time of 9:58.79, while classmate Molly Renfer took runner-up in the 800 meters with a time of 2:13.33.
On the men’s side, freshman Jonas Aranda took runner-up honors with a 1:55.11 finish in the 800 meter run. Senior Will Geiken took second in a close 5,000 meter race—clocking in at 14:48.52—just over a second behind Yale’s Kevin Dooney.
In the 1,500 meter race, senior Dan Milechman placed second with a time of 3:55.25, with junior Tom Purnell just behind him in fourth place, clocking at 3:56.23.
Though Saretsky was impressed by the solid performances all around, the coach believes there is still room for improvement.
“We’re getting there,” Saretsky said. “I still feel like we’ve got a lot of work to do, [and] don’t really feel like we’re firing on all cylinders, but we’re certainly heading in the right direction.”
The winning performances weren’t limited to the track, as the field athletes provided various personal records and top-10 Harvard records.
In the women’s high jump, sophomore Raegan Nizdil and senior Ann Giebelhaus tied for first with leaps of 1.65 meters, while Morrison claimed the long jump with a mark of 5.73 meters.
On the men’s side, Uwaifo claimed the long jump and triple jump with marks of 7.09 and 12.9 meters, respectively. In the high jump, junior Spencer Lemons’ 1.99 meter mark was good enough to take home the title.
The pole vault also proved to be successful for the Crimson, as sophomore Andrew Roney claimed a personal record with a 5.01 meter leap, the fourth-best finish in Harvard history. On the women’s side, rookie Marlena Sabatino earned a personal record and the program sixth-best height at 3.65 meters.
Sophomores Nikki Okwelogu and Julian Nunally took home a pair of victories in the shot put and discus. Okwelogu set a school record best in the outdoor shot put with a mark of 16.58 meters, continuing her indoor success.
In the javelin, Hannah Meyer and Richard Bradley took home their titles with marks of 47.14 and 55.16 meters, respectively.
In total, 24 of the Harvard entries qualified to the intercontinental competition in June, making sure the Crimson is well represented this summer in what will be the collegiate swan song for seniors such as Harris.
“I’m very pleased that the majority of this Harvard-Yale combined team will be my very own Harvard teammates,” Harris said. “For me, as a senior that makes my graduation and consummation of my collegiate career that much sweeter.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the score knotted at nine and under three minutes to play, Penn freshman midfielder Kevin McGeary completed his hat trick and gave the Quakers their first lead of the game.
That would be the only lead Penn (5-6, 2-3 Ivy) needed as the visiting Quakers held on for a 10-9 victory over the Harvard men’s lacrosse team (6-6, 1-3) on Saturday at Soldiers Field Lacrosse Stadium. Penn kept the Crimson scoreless for the final 10 minutes of the contest.
Harvard entered the matchup with the Quakers coming off back-to-back one-goal wins, including a victory over No. 8 Cornell that got the Crimson in the win column in Ivy League play. Just as it did against the Big Red, Harvard stormed out to an early lead on Saturday as a goal by senior long stick midfielder Brian Fischer gave the Crimson a 3-1 advantage.
Although Penn responded with a tally to pull within one at the end of the first quarter, sophomore faceoff specialist Austin Williams won the opening draw of the second frame and went straight to the cage, notching his second goal of the season to bring the lead back to two goals.
After a Quaker goal cut the lead back to one, scores by junior attackman Will Walker and freshman midfielder Sean Coleman, both assisted by junior attackman Devin Dwyer, closed out the half to give Harvard a 6-3 advantage at the break.
The second half, however, was an entirely different story for the Crimson. Although Harvard outshot Penn, only nine of its 22 second half shots were on net.
“Our inability to finish our possessions and finish our opportunities was the biggest difference-maker in the game,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said.
Senior goaltender John Lopes replaced junior starter Jimmy Sestilio in cage for the Quakers to start the third quarter, and he turned away five shots in the period to hold the Crimson to just one goal in the quarter.
“A lot of credit ought to go to Lopes,” junior goalkeeper Bryan Moore said. “[He] gave them the spark they needed in the second half.”
Moore himself has experience in the same situation, as his stellar second half relief play in early-season tilts with UMass and Quinnipiac sparked Harvard to victories and earned him the starting nod for the rest of the season.
Despite the lack of offense for the Crimson, the home squad still carried a 7-5 lead into the final 15 minutes after limiting Penn to just two goals in the third quarter. Senior midfielder Joe McCallion had both markers for the Quakers in the frame, increasing his team-leading total to 21 for the season.
In the opening minutes of the fourth quarter, the teams traded tallies to bring the score to 9-7 in favor of Harvard. However, the Penn defense again stifled the Crimson offense down the stretch, while the Quaker offense did just enough to pull ahead. McGeary led the charge down the stretch, scoring two of his three goals during the three-goal run to close the game.
“[The result] was frustrating. We couldn’t separate, we had the lead the whole game,” Wojcik said. “That, I think, was a flaw in the way we played.”
Saturday’s game was the third straight one-goal game and fifth of the season for Harvard. Additionally, three of the team’s league games have been decided by one goal, reflecting the parity that has existed in the Ancient Eight all season. Despite currently residing on the bottom of the league standings, the Crimson can sneak into the postseason Ivy League Tournament with wins over Princeton and Yale to end the year.
“Our next two contests are under our control,” Moore said. “We have confidence that we can beat anyone if we play Harvard lacrosse for 60 plus minutes, so that’s what our goal will be moving forward.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Shipping down to Providence for a four-game series with Brown to open Red Rolfe Division play this weekend, Harvard (16-15, 5-7 Ivy) took the middle two games against the Bears (8-20, 4-8) behind a 21-run outburst one day and strong pitching the next. But with Dartmouth sweeping Yale, the Crimson fell three games behind the seven-time defending division champion Big Green.
“Having a game tomorrow [against UMass] is actually pretty nice for us,” senior Jake McGuiggan said.“Obviously we didn’t want to finish this weekend with a loss, but I think it’s nice for us to get back at it tomorrow with the opportunity to play a night game at Fenway [for the Beanpot final] on the line.”
BROWN 8, HARVARD 7
Sunday’s second game was a back-and-forth affair with the hosts eventually coming out on top. A two-run home run by captain Ethan Ferreira in the top of the ninth proved not to be enough, as Brown reliever Reid Anderson was able to pick up the final two outs and secure the win.
Crimson senior Tanner Anderson was not at his best after having to finish Sunday’s first game, lasting just two and a third innings and giving up four earned runs. With the Bears up 4-2 after three innings, Harvard fought back to take a brief one-run lead.
But Brown tacked on four runs with two-run sixth and eighth innings off Harvard relievers Nick Scahill and T.J. Laurisch. Robert Henry had three hits for the hosts, while Noah Shulman drove in three runs.
HARVARD 3, BROWN 2
While both games Saturday were dominated by offense, Sunday’s first game was a pitchers’ duel. Junior Sean Poppen led the Crimson to the win, throwing six and a third innings, allowing two runs and striking out 10. The righty improved to 4-2 on the season.
After loading the bases in the bottom of the seventh, Poppen was replaced by Anderson. A Henry sac fly made it 3-2 but the righty was able to get Jake Levine to groundout to end the game. Senior Jack Colton drove in two runs, and freshman Connor Quinn had two hits for Harvard.
“With the Ivy League, you can lose one in a nail biter and then 30 minutes later, you’re battling again,” sophomore Matt Hink said.“It’s very important for our team to wipe it out of our mind and get ready to go 15 minutes later to warm up and prepare for the next game.”
HARVARD 21, BROWN 7
The Crimson offense exploded for 21 runs and 23 hits to give senior Matt Timoney his team-leading fifth win of the season. Harvard scored in every inning but the sixth. Hink led the way for the Crimson, going 5-for-5 with two doubles and four runs batted in.
“For me, that was for sure my best day at the plate as far as production went and [with] my approach,” Hink said. “I was really seeing it well and I thought my approach was much better than it has been and that also carried into today.”
The offense hit .451 on the afternoon to raise its Ivy League batting average to .362. Timoney surrendered five earned runs but struck out eight in his five and a third innings of work. The two-touchdown margin of victory was Harvard’s largest since 2006.
BROWN 9, HARVARD 6
The Bears scored eight runs in sophomore Nick Gruener’s first two innings of work to down the Crimson in Saturday’s first game. Brown was aided by three home runs off Gruener, who had only surrendered one long ball entering the day and had been dominant last weekend against Princeton.
Down 9-1 after four innings, the Harvard offense chipped away at the lead with five runs in the game’s final three innings. Ferreira, Colton, and senior Mike Martin hit home runs for the Crimson. Freshmen Garrett Rupp and Noah Zavolas were solid out of the bullpen, allowing just three hits in three innings of combined work.
“That first game was definitely a kick in the teeth for us,” McGuiggan said.“In between games, we just focused up and knew that we really needed to respond in a big way. Once the offense started to get going a little, it just built on that. That’s definitely the best offensive display we’ve shown.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
­Coming off back-to-back wins in California, the No. 20 Harvard women’s water polo team traveled to Princeton this weekend for a three-game slate against three separate conference opponents.
Entering the week ranked fourth in the CWPA Poll, the Crimson (17-10, 4-2 CWPA) managed to win its first contest against Notre Dame College but fell to Indiana and Michigan, two of the three teams that separate Harvard from the top of the rankings.
“We played pretty well,” junior attacker Charlotte Hendrix said. “We had a few breakdowns here and there which led to our losses. But I think overall we played two top-20 overall teams, and we now see we’re right there with them.”
MICHIGAN 12, HARVARD 9
Sophomore attacker Michelle Martinelli shined for the Crimson on Sunday, but it was not enough to take down No. 15 Michigan.
The second-year attacker recorded three assists to go along with a hat trick, but four third-quarter goals from the Wolverines (15-11, 6-1) pushed their two-goal lead at halftime to four.
“[Martinelli] had the right mindset,” Hendrix said. “Every shot she took was amazing, and it was very helpful [for the team].”
Junior attacker Yoshi Andersen and sophomores Melissa Balding and Lexi del Toro were all able to score in the first period to keep the Crimson within one headed into the second frame. Low scoring plagued the second quarter, with the teams combining for just three goals, enabling Michigan to enter the halfup by two.
Ejections held Harvard up throughout the game. The Crimson accumulated 21 penalties throughout the game, and the Wolverines capitalized on Harvard’s mistakes.
INDIANA 12, HARVARD 7
Despite only trailing No. 16 Indiana (17-11, 5-1) by one goal heading into the second half, the Crimson offense sputtered out of the locker room. The squad only managed to net three more tallies, while the Hoosiers cruised to victory with seven second-half goals.
Despite the offensive prowess that Indiana demonstrated throughout the contest, co-captain goalkeeper Ariel Dukes played well, notching 12 saves in the game to keep her team within striking distance for most of the day.
“Indiana obviously had great shooters,” Dukes said. “We weren’t able to pull it out.”
After scoring only one goal in the first frame, Harvard registered three in the following period, including one by Hendrix in the final seconds before halftime to send the Crimson into the intermission with momentum. But Harvard would fall short for the 13th consecutive time against the Hoosiers, bringing its three-game wining streak to a halt.
HARVARD 15, NOTRE DAME COLLEGE 1
The Crimson easily took care of business in the first game of its three-game road trip, storming out to an 11-goal lead in the first half to take down Notre Dame College (1-12) by double-digits. Martinelli led Harvard’s offensive explosion, notching a hat trick in the first half to propel her team to eight first-quarter goals.
“Sometimes when you play teams you know aren’t as good as you, you tend to play down to them,” Hendrix said. “We’ve been doing that over the course of the season, but we finally came out and played hard.”
Sophomore defender Zoe Osborne also stepped up for the Crimson, netting two second-quarter tallies. The Crimson took its foot off the pedal in the second half, netting only three goals. But its defensive effort left the Falcons unable to beat Dukes at all in the second half, allowing the Crimson to glide to a victory.
After starting off the season 13-5, the team has dropped five of its last nine, albeit often to ranked competition. Nonetheless, the team remains confident that it is poised to play well at the CWPA Eastern Championships later this month.
“We’re very excited,” Dukes said. “Now we have time to work on the things that you can work on before…postseason play.”
