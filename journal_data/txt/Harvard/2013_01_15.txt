After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Within  a small Massachusetts fishing village, three reunited friends struggle  to find happiness in Tom O’Brien’s new film “Fairhaven.”
 “Fairhaven” features O’Brien, who also wrote the film with co-star  Chris Messina, as Jon, a former high school football star who, like his  hero Tom Brady did in a real “60 Minutes” interview, questions whether  he really can have it all in life. Jon openly grapples with the  uneasiness this brings him and seeks understanding from others, from a  meditation coach to a therapist. He is not alone in his search—Dave  (Messina) feels similarly distraught and hides behind a façade of a  carefree life. However, having to return to Fairhaven for his father’s  funeral forces Dave to realize that he cannot run away from his  problems. Meanwhile, responsible, single father Sam (Rich Sommer) tries  to move on from his ex-wife Kate (Sarah Paulson). As he takes back the  part of himself he had lost in his love for Kate, Sam begins to find  happiness again in who he is. 
 
Sommer,  best known for his portrayal of Harry Crane on “Mad Men,” shared in an  interview how the film’s cast worked together to bring the screenplay to  life as a sincere, relatable story. 
 
The  Harvard Crimson: You’ve had a diverse array of roles in your acting  experience, most notably a part on “Mad Men.” How does playing Sam  compare?
 
Rich  Sommer: It's frankly my favorite performance of mine. We were able to  do with it what we wanted, and I was able to get out of Sam what I  haven't been able to do with other characters. I portrayed him how I  wanted to portray him.
 
THC: What was it like working with the other cast members of “Fairhaven”?
 
RS:  We were kind of isolated in this very small town in the middle of  winter. We luckily all hit it off so quickly; for a movie like this,  it's imperative. I feel this is an intimate movie, and you can only get  there if you are willing to be open with each other and trust each  other. 
 
THC:  Jon seems to remain stuck on Tom Brady’s question of whether there is  more to life.  What central questions does “Fairhaven” explore?
 
RS: Am I ever going to be happy, no matter what I do? These are three guys in different stages of asking that question.
 
THC: Do you see yourself in Sam?
 
RS:  Our characters became more like us. We were given the freedom by Tom.  Sam is as close to me as I've ever played in a character. I've never had  the creative liberty that Tom gave me. It was a lot of trust. It led to  a lot of conversations, and we always came to an amicable consensus.
 
THC: What message do you think viewers will take away from “Fairhaven”? 
 
RS:  It's a glimpse into a pretty accurate depiction of three high school  buddies. Hopefully people will be able to relate to the friendship.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Massachusetts court has dismissed the wrongful death suit filed against Harvard and three of its employees by the mother of Justin D. C. D. Cosby.
Cosby, a Cambridge resident, was fatally shot in 2009 in the basement of Kirkland House during a drug deal gone wrong. His mother B. Denise Cosby filed a wrongful death suit in May against the University, Lowell Co-House Masters Dorothy A. Austin and Diana L. Eck, and chemistry and chemical biology lecturer Ryan M. Spoering, who was resident dean of Lowell at the time of the shooting.
The lawsuit alleged that Harvard had acted negligently by allowing the man who eventually would be convicted of Justin Cosby’s murder to live in Lowell House for months, in violation of University rules. Harvard’s lawyers had argued that the University had no duty to protect Cosby.
In a ruling obtained by the Boston Globe, Middlesex Superior Court Judge Mitchell Kaplan sided with Harvard, dismissing the lawsuit against the University and its three employees.
“There is nothing inherent in knowingly or negligently allowing a Harvard student to permit her boyfriend to stay in her room such that a reasonable person would expect visitors to the University would be protected from the foreseeable deadly conduct of the room guest,” wrote Kaplan in the nine-page opinion.
Denise Cosby’s original complaint centered around a Harvard rule that requires students to speak with their House Master before hosting a non-Harvard guest for more than two nights.
Jabrai Jordan Copney, the man convicted of shooting Justin Cosby, resided on campus for months in the Lowell House dorm room of his girlfriend in violation of Harvard rules. The Harvard College Handbook for Students, which was cited in the complaint, states that “The hosts of repeated overnight guests who are not Harvard students must make their guests’ presence known to the Building Manager and security personnel due to safety considerations.”
The complaint alleged that Harvard was at fault because the three Lowell House officials either “knowingly allowed Copney, a nonstudent, to live in the Lowell House for an extended period of time, in contravention of Harvard’s rules, and allowed him to have unfettered access to the House and the rest of Harvard’s campus,” or “negligently failed to detect Copney’s continuing, unauthorized presence.”
Harvard in September submitted a legal filing saying the University could not be blamed for Cosby’s death. Harvard’s lead attorney Martin F. Murphy stressed that point when the two sides traded arguments in court during a hearing on Dec. 19.
“Particularly [when] the plaintiff has come onto the property in order to engage in dangerous activities, the law makes it clear that [Harvard] doesn’t have that duty of safety to [Cosby],” said Murphy in December.
During that same hearing, attorneys representing Cosby’s mother argued that the University had allowed a dangerous situation to develop by not enforcing its own policies regarding guests in Harvard dorms.
“The only reason this became a situation is because of [Harvard’s] negligence,” said Isaac H. Peres, the plaintiff’s lead attorney, at the time.
According to testimony from Copney’s murder trial, he and two other men cornered Justin Cosby in the basement of Kirkland’s J-entryway on May 18, 2009. Cosby sold marijuana to Harvard students and the group demanded that he hand over the drugs he had with him. When Cosby refused, Copney shot him, prosecutors and witnesses said.
In April 2011 Copney was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of Cosby. His two companions testified against Copney in exchange for lighter sentences and both pleaded guilty to manslaughter.

Days after internet activist Aaron Swartz's Jan. 11 suicide, The Huffington Post reports that during the 1990s, Swartz's prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen Heymann—who was, even then, a pioneer in policing the internet—tried to get Harvard's cooperation in monitoring the University's network usage without a court order. Heymann proposed that the University put an "electronic banner on its intranet telling users they were being monitored" and implying their consent. Harvard refused, HuffPo reports, citing "the privacy of its users."
Here's more from a 1996 issue of Network World:
"Harvard University was recently the undercover site for the Department of Justice's network surveillance of Julio Cesar Ardita, an Argentinian charged with breaking into the Navy's computers via the Internet. […]
But Harvard balked at [Heymann's] request [to put in place the electric banner]. 'We don't monitor the network, and we respect the privacy of our users,' said Franklin Steen, the Harvard network director. So the Justice Department got a 30-day court order, with extensions, and did the data tap to catch Ardita. The court order came with a gag rule to keep anyone from talking about it, which could tip off the suspect."
This revelation comes as MIT begins an internal inquiry into its role in Aaron Swartz's suicide. Swartz, who served as a fellow at Harvard's Safra Center for Ethics during the 2010-2011 academic year, faced decades in prison for allegedly downloading millions of academic articles from JSTOR via MIT's network, with the intent to distribute them. Though JSTOR encouraged Heymann to drop charges, MIT did not.
On Sunday, "hacktivist" collective Anonymous briefly took over two MIT websites and network through a denial-of-service attack. Their message, which appeared on two sites, stated that they "do not consign blame or responsibility on MIT for what has happened," but referred to this as "a time of soul-searching" for those within the MIT community.
