After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On January 26th, in a speech at the University of Michigan, President Obama announced a large number of reforms to college financial aid programs, specifically tying a college’s eligibility for funding to that college’s ability to keep tuition fees down. This would apply to programs such as Perkins loans, work-study jobs and supplemental grants for low-income students. However, his speech has stirred some controversy, as state-funded colleges have already had to cut significant costs as a result of previous fiscal reforms implemented by the Obama administration. Ultimately, Obama’s reforms are positive changes, considering that most schools are ill equipped to help their students deal with the ever-increasing cost of higher education.
Education in America is quite expensive compared to education in other countries. The United Kingdom, which has a higher education system on par with that of the United States in terms of quality, has a maximum cap on education tuition of £9000 (or USD $14,300). Obama’s reforms will significantly help to alleviate the serious financial burden of American higher education.  He specifically addresses the problem of interest rates on student loans, which can be as high as 25 percent for private student loans. Obama’s plan will make it easier for students graduating from high school to apply for and eventually pay for college and will improve the work-study program.  Obama is also introducing a new $1 billion Race to the Top competition and a $55 million “first in the world” competition to reward states for improving efficiency and keeping down costs. Obama also plans to increase Perkins loans, a federal program providing low interest loans to help needy students finance the costs of postsecondary education, from $1 billion to $8 billion. All these measures will provide greater accessibility to college and will go a long way to alleviating this serious problem.
Another aspect of Obama’s plans for higher education involves releasing net costs, graduation rates, and employment information. Given the significant difficulty of paying off student debt, this information is important for students to consider when deciding which colleges they want to apply to and which courses of study to pursue. While we can understand the usefulness of such information, it is imperative that the government ensure that schools, while making these statistics available, don’t use them to funnel students into particular majors or programs.  There is a temptation when dealing with this sort of information to portray a college education as simply a means to earn more money when in reality it is much more than that, and provides graduates of college with myriad lifelong benefits unrelated to a higher starting salary or career advancement; the government must be careful when dispersing this information to note that you can’t judge the value of a degree in dollars and cents.
Obama’s reforms are well intended and will have significant positive ramifications. They expand on his general proposals on education from his State of the Union speech and demonstrate his seriousness about tackling the vital issue of rising tuition and student loan rates.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I spent the bulk of last summer in Southern California working at a major aerospace defense contractor. Despite the weather, the mood was none too happy. Decades-old production runs had their ends in sight and new government money streams were either drying up or freezing depending on whom you asked. In the midst of the infamous 2011 debt-limit negotiations, everything and everyone was on the block.
But, there was one great white hope! The one tech to save them all! The word on the tip of everyone’s tongue: drones.
“Drones are the future!” We interns heard that often enough, and a quick look at the data shows it to be undeniably true. Soon, the Air Force will be training more drone crews than fighter and bomber pilots combined. The drone fleet has increased from 200 on September 11th to over 7,000 today and, in the face of major troop reductions, the Pentagon plans to spend $40 billion on 700 more medium and large drones over the next decade.
Numbers aside, the larger point probably isn’t news to anyone reading this column; drones have been all over the media lately. They—along with badass special forces—are meant to be the cornerstone of America’s Afghan policy and are breathing new life into defense contractors’ coffers.
Still, I’m a bit skeptical about the way the drone conversation is playing out. Of course, you can’t rightly argue that putting someone’s son in harm’s way is the best solution when a lifeless robot can do the same job. In most cases, avoiding endangering a life is worth a lot more than a job done—perhaps—a bit better. Imagine the geopolitical fallout if it had been a piloted spy plane that had “wandered” into Iran over J-Term and crashed. This and other benefits of drones are frequently touted by Washington and relayed by the press. However, the media isn’t putting into consideration their possible pitfalls. This week, I’d like to karthink about some of them.
The most popular argument is something akin to comparing pilots sitting in front of monitors and joysticks in the Nevada desert to Ender Wiggin from those books everyone read in middle school. Because he thought he was just playing a video game, Ender took heroic risks and unwittingly killed off an entire alien race. That does the real-life airmen a disservice. Their operations may lack in immediate danger, but they are still highly trained soldiers who understand and respond to the implications of their mission-specific choices as well as pilots ever have. This is not to minimize the importance of continuing to strive for zero collateral damage, but recent reports suggest that the ratio of civilian deaths from drone strikes is overblown.
Rather than go down that well-worn route, I wanted to consider the undeniable impact that drones will have on public awareness and on Washington’s policy and military decisions. I’m worried that drones are already allowing the government to fight too invisible a war, one that rages across the globe and affects only a very small number of the domestic population. As fewer troops rotate through war zones, fewer families and communities will be touched by their absence. It’s not difficult to imagine a situation where media attention and public concern begin to fade, and the important check those forces provide on government activity abroad vanishes in tow.
In such a scenario, the government will be able to take bigger operational risks with less fallout if things go south. As more, varied, and better drones become ever more useful substitutes for riskier methods of force projection, diplomacy could lose much of its attractiveness. War is usually considered in terms of blood and treasure, but the two don’t function in quite the same way; it’s a lot easier to spend cash, and lawmakers are pretty good at it. If technology one day makes human costs negligible, military action—and, in a good economy, even spending—becomes much easier to justify.
Not to get all 1984, but if the government is able to fight an invisible war a world away without much public resistance, what’s to stop war from becoming a perpetual phenomenon? In fact, that may be exactly what’s necessary to fight equally invisible terrorists. The war in Afghanistan is already the longest war in American history, and once the troops come home in 2014, it’ll undoubtedly still be raging in the skies.
Drones have admittedly been the most important addition to our arsenal in recent years. They will continue to save countless American lives with each bad guy they take out. But if soldiers are not at higher-than-average risk, their day-to-day operational outcomes are rarely newsworthy. How often do we read stories about routine Navy patrols or Army exercises, even when they’ve gone slightly awry? Unless the media keeps a steady and critical focus on military operations, war may be at risk of becoming something akin to a spectator sport—coverage materializing only when the military or Central Intelligence Agency feels like sharing something big.

John Maynard Keynes, the British economist widely considered the father of modern macroeconomics, wrote in 1935 that “the social object of skilled investment should be to defeat the dark forces of time and ignorance which envelop our future.”  His words of John Maynard Keynes may be equally relevant today. We have just emerged from one of the largest financial crises in our country’s history, where the “dark forces of time and ignorance,” as applied to financial instruments like mortgage-backed securities, contributed to the excessive financial leveraging that necessitated “Too Big to Fail” measures and a taxpayer bail-out of $85 billion for one company alone. As a result, the ethics of investment practices have since been the subject of increased scrutiny.
Despite the costly financial and ethical lessons learned since 2008, have we really changed the way we think about and make investment decisions?
By some measures, yes. At Harvard, at least, post-crisis resolutions have focused on reducing risk and exposure in our endowment portfolio. Such reduction has been accomplished through increasing in-house asset management, the appointment of a designated chief risk officer in 2009 to perform restructuring, and the sale of illiquid assets like private equity vehicles to facilitate immediate access to cash that could be used towards the purchase of sub-market priced securities.
Yet, one area in which Harvard has been conspicuously silent is whether its investment practices can and should be informed by fundamental social and environmental values. In its submission to the College Sustainability Report Card, Harvard received “A”s across the board, with the notable exception of one “C” in endowment transparency. So why doesn’t Harvard engage in responsible investing?
Responsible investing—also known as socially responsible investing, or SRI—is the practice of investing for the purpose of reaping not only financial returns, but also social benefits.  SRI can take many forms, including divestment from undesirable investments, community investing, and social screening, i.e. integration of environmental, social and governance concerns to inform investment choices.  The adoption of responsible investing has proliferated over the last two decades, rising from $639 billion in 1995 to $2.71 trillion in 2007, and major institutional investors such as CalPERS, with over $218 billion under management, have pledged to incorporate environmental, social, and governance criteria across all of its asset classes.
Persistent critiques of responsible investing brand it a violation of central tenets of Modern Portfolio Theory, or a breach of fiduciary duty because it constrains optimal portfolio. Thus, due to responsible investment’s added focus on social gains, many believe that portfolios engaging in RI strategies must make sacrifices in financial returns.
This assumption is false.
 
Recent research has demonstrated that responsible investing can provide market rate returns—and, sometimes, perform even better than conventional investing strategies. In the close to twenty years since its creation, the Domini 400 Social Index—an index of 400 largely U.S.-based companies that are filtered by social impact criteria—has always either matched or surpassed the performance of the S&P 500. Applied to Harvard’s own investing strategy, responsible investing is an opportunity to allow the university to represent its values in its investment choices without sacrificing the portfolio’s financial gains.
Harvard’s history shows a precedent of responsible investing. In 1972, under President Derek C. Bok’s leadership, Harvard created the Advisory Committee on Shareholder Responsibility and the Corporation Committee on Shareholder Responsibility to provide recommendations on how the school should cast its proxy votes. In that same year, Harvard also helped found the Investor Responsibility  Research Center under Institutional Shareholder Services, which researches corporate governance and social responsibility for institutional investors. Forty years ago, Harvard was in the vanguard of responsible investment.
But university leadership did not take action by themselves: students, alumni, and faculty played a crucial role in advocating for change. For example, during the 1980s, students and alumni protested Harvard’s investments in companies that operated in apartheid South Africa. As a result, Harvard Management Company partially divested. More recently, in 2005 and 2006, Harvard sold its stake in the PetroChina and Sinopec companies in response to student protests over links between these firms and genocide in Darfur.
In the wake of the most recent financial crisis and reflecting on the 40th anniversary of the ACSR and the IRRC, it is high time for Harvard to once again become a leader in the area of responsible investment. There are a number of options available to Harvard: it can enlarge the mandates of the ACSR and CCSR beyond proxy voting on directly held investments, establish a social choice fund to allow donors more control over how their gift is managed, create a time-delayed mechanism for transparency to allow more oversight from members of the University community, and start a new unit at the Harvard Management Company dedicated to the integration of RI principles across all asset classes.
 
Harvard should take steps to implement any or all of these measures as the HMC continues the process of restructuring; indeed, some—like creating a social choice fund—could be implemented fairly easily and quickly, in a matter of months rather than years. By taking action in these areas, Harvard can break new ground in the realm of responsible university endowment management and better protect itself from extra-financial risk factors that have proven so devastating in recent years. More importantly, though, Harvard has the opportunity to use RI to bring our investments, a key component of our global influence, in line with the values of the university.

A Destructive Mentality
To the editor:
“Fighting Apartheid with Equality” (Feb. 27, 2012) is the kind of article that reflects why the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has lasted so long and why the Palestinians have inflicted so much unnecessary suffering on themselves.
The authors, throwing around and misusing words like apartheid and equality, are simply reiterating the old goal of the Palestinians that has been at the root of the conflict from the outset: the desire to see the disappearance of the Jewish state.
The fact that Israel is still the only true democracy in the region; the fact that Israel has made numerous offers to the Palestinians that if accepted would have led to a Palestinian state; the fact that Arabs living in Israel have equal rights; the fact every international body has supported the right of the Jews to a state in their historic homeland—none of these things matter to the authors of this article.
It is, as is the “One-State Conference,” an assault on the very existence of a member state of the United Nations. That is bad enough. Even worse, it is this kind of mentality, the continued efforts to find a way to destroy Israel, if not by arms than by politics, which has prevented the Palestinians to make the fundamental transformation that will bring about a two-state solution. Only by finally accepting Israel’s legitimacy can the conflict end and the Palestinians achieve an independent state.
In other words, these writers, and indeed, all those behind this conference, are not only vile bashers of the Jewish people but they are also the worst enemies of the Palestinians themselves, the very people they claim to be helping.

The Blessings of Unpaid Internships
To the editor:
In Julian A. Lopez’s recent article, “The Bane of Unpaid Internships,” the author nostalgically recalls the days when internships were paid as a ‘relic of the past.’ Ah yes, recall when internships were paid, Tim Allen was funny, and Pogs were cool?
Internships have changed because times have changed. College students spend their summers working without pay because they choose unpaid internships over paying jobs. Hospitality services and merchandise are jobs that do not offer unpaid internships because they offer money for real hard work instead. If a student is willing to take an unpaid internship, their main motivation must therefore be more than monetary. Instead, they are probably looking to gain experience in a particular field. Yet this field of work, be it law or finance or entertainment, does not stand to gain much by hiring a twenty-something nobody for eighty-something days.
Consider the perspective on the opposite side of the application. You are looking at the application of some sophomoric sophomore who can offer two and a half months work, barely enough time to figure out how the copier works. For all the clubs, awards, and résumé regalia, all that glitters is not gold. Nothing, not even the hyped-up H-bomb of the applicant’s alma mater, matters compared to real world experience. What’s more, you have résumés of qualified full-time applicants with mouths to feed, debts to meet, and bills more serious than a monthly subscription to Netflix to pay. Simply put, there are worthier candidates out there and a college student’s sole competitive edge is an unpaid internship.
Companies must meet six very strict federal requirements to offer an unpaid internship. Not only must an internship not displace an employee but it also legally cannot provide any gain to the employer. Under current law, it is illegal for an unpaid intern to provide any useful service to a company. It is little wonder why companies flagrantly violate this law. It makes a mockery of itself. The federal restrictions are both costly and downright impractical. Of the companies that do not violate the law, many simply refuse to offer internships. The severity of these restrictions may explain why, as the author cites, unemployment among teenagers is 18 percent.
Internships may be without pay but they are not without profit. Interns get references, connections, mentors, exposure, and experiences for the perfect résumé and for the perfect cocktail party story. Unpaid internships are an asset to the economy and an investment in the future.
Sincerely,
Sarah Siskind ’14

Lin-Manuel Miranda is the Tony Award-winning composer, lyricist, and  star of the Broadway musical “In the Heights.” FM sat down with Miranda  to discuss his visit to Harvard, his career thus far, and his skills  with freestyle rap.
1. Fifteen Minutes: What did you discuss in your lecture on Feb. 28?
Lin-Manuel Miranda: I participated in this class [Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding 31: “American Musicals and American Culture”] last year. It was a very fun discussion. I talked a little bit about the development of an original musical, but I also talked a little about the history of musical theater and the form. I mean, what’s fun about the musical is it’s not one art form—it’s 12 art forms smashed together—and so the development of an original one is always a different route no matter what the show is.
2. FM: What do you hope students here can learn from you and your story?
LMM: That’s a great question. I think that what I have is the unique perspective of someone who has been through it. Like all of you, I went to college—I went to Wesleyan—and I actually wrote the first draft of “In the Heights” my sophomore year in school. I had the sort of dream-come-true situation of someone who wrote a show in school and actually got it up professionally, which does not happen often. So, I don’t feel that far removed from your experience. I feel like my perspective on it is much closer to you guys than it is to the other side.
3. FM: You worked as an English teacher at your old high school while working on “In the Heights.” What grades did you instruct and what are a couple of your favorite books that you taught?
LMM: I taught seventh grade English and one of my two favorite things to teach was “Things Fall Apart” by Chinua Achebe. It was amazing to watch seventh graders grasp it because there is some really tough stuff in it, but once they get their heads around it, it inspires a lot of amazing writing from them. The other one was “A Midsummer Night’s Dream.” The best way to teach any Shakespeare is to get up and do it because they’re plays—they’re not pieces of literature to be read—and so I’d make every kid in the class play a part every day, and we read through the whole play, and it was a lot of fun. So that’s always a real highlight.
4. FM: What was it like to perform your Alexander Hamilton rap for the President?
LMM: Oh, very boring—no, I’m kidding! It was really one of the highlights of my career just to be asked to perform at the White House, much less debut something new and have it be as well received as it has been.
FM: Are there any updates on the Alexander Hamilton mixtape?
LMM: Only that I’ve gotten a lot more of it written and I hope to complete the album sometime this year.
5. FM: Can you talk about “Bring It On: The Musical” and how you approached it?
LMM: The fun of that was that it was really conceived as an original dance musical—I worked with Andy Blankenbuehler on “In the Heights” as our choreographer, and he’s our choreographer slash director here, so we had a shorthand already. And then the other highlight was getting to work with Tom Kitt and Amanda Green; it’s not often that you get to work with other composers and lyricists on a project—usually it’s just me. I learned an enormous amount from this creative team and we’re really proud of the show and its effect on audiences, so I’m curious to see what the future life of it will bring.
6. FM: I read that you were working on an Adult Swim pilot with [your hip-hop improv group] Freestyle Love Supreme—what’s the deal with that?
LMM: The deal with that is that we have a really great script and we’re waiting for approval to shoot it. I wrote a spec song, and some of the other members have written some music for it, and so we’re just sort of waiting for the go ahead to film the pilot. But it’s been a joy to work on—these are guys I’ve literally known all of my twenties, and we all have tattoos together, so let’s try to make a TV show together!
FM: What’s the tattoo?
LMM: We all have variations on our microphone logo—I have one on my back.
7. FM: Were you worried that traditional Broadway audiences wouldn’t like “In the Heights”? It’s so different from most things on Broadway.
LMM: I was worried I wasn’t going to get my show on! The odds are so long against you in this business. But I was very lucky in that we had great creative team; we had producers who had done this kind of thing before. They were experienced in taking chances on young talent, from Jonathan Larson to Bobby Lopez to...everybody! I felt in good hands, and my goal was always just to write the best show possible and the rest would hopefully take care of itself.  At the end of the day, you could work eight years on a musical and it could run a day or two days or eight days, so you have to be proud of it. That’s the baseline rule: you have to be proud of your work, because whether it succeeds or fails you’re the one who has to live with it at the end of the day.
8. FM: Did the success of “In the Heights” change your opinion about what Broadway could handle?
LMM: No. I’m not someone who likes to think about Broadway in trends. I know that critics get paid a lot of money to be like “The British Invasion” or “The Ironic Invasion”—you know, they group things. But I’ve seen some very daring stuff on Broadway. I remember seeing “Bring in da Noise, Bring in da Funk” when I was 17 years old and I couldn’t believe what I was seeing—everything from that to “Next to Normal” a couple of years ago. I think there is always stuff that breaks through that someone is willing to spend money on to take it to that sacred bit of real estate on Broadway. Because that’s all it is, it’s real estate.
And there are a lot of amazing shows that don’t play Broadway. I think of “Hedwig and the Angry Inch” or “Tick, Tick...Boom!” or “The Last Five Years,” so it didn’t change my view. I was just really gratified that people embraced our show because it was my baby!
9. FM: You say that one of the biggest influences for “In the Heights” was “Fiddler on the Roof”—how does that work? The two seem so completely different.
LMM: Structurally. They’re similar in that they’re both musicals about a community and a community that is changing. Once we realized that we could learn an enormous amount from Fiddler, because you know that opening number of Fiddler is a masterpiece: it is “Here I am,” “Who are we?” and “How does this world work?” And Tevye takes you through the world—he’s like, “This is my family, these are my daughters, these are the other special people in our village, and then these are the outsiders in the village,” and that’s exactly the setup of the opening number of “In the Heights:” This is who I am; you meet my family first, and then you start meeting the concentric circles increasingly wide around. Their outside force is about the breaking down of tradition; for us, it’s a group of people who all come from different countries but live in this neighborhood. It’s still the same questions of: what traditions do we hang on to? What do we leave behind? What are we willing to sacrifice? And what are we not willing to sacrifice? So, in that sense it’s very spiritually linked to Fiddler in our heads.
10. FM: One of the big messages I get from listening to “In the Heights” is the importance of the values in the song “Paciencia y Fe” [“Patience and Faith”]—to what extent does this influence the way you approach real life?
LMM: That line came out of finding a phrase that would encapsulate Abuela Claudia’s worldview—this is a woman who plays the numbers everyday and then one day hits it. One, it sings really well, and then it became sort of—you know I wrote that song about 2004, it wasn’t in the original version—but it became our mantra for the writing of the show, which took a very long time but required a lot of patience and faith that we would eventually get it right. So, I don’t know—I think it’s pretty good words of wisdom to just sort of have in your back pocket.
11. FM: In “In the Heights,” Nina goes to Stanford and then drops out. Ignoring the fact that she eventually goes back, do you think she would have done better if she had gone to Harvard?
LMM: (Laughs.) Well she would have been closer to home, that’s for sure! It would probably interest you to know that in the Wesleyan version, she went to Yale. And for reasons of real estate and for reasons of people asking the very sensible question of “Why is she home for the first time in a year if she just lives an hour and a half away?” we threw her across the country. That’s really the main reason for picking Stanford. We wanted a really good school that she couldn’t check back in from—we wanted to really distance her from the community.
12. FM: What is your favorite flavor of piragua [a shaved ice drink]?
LMM: I go back and forth—I like tamarindo a lot, because it’s something they’ll never offer in slushy form; it’s like a unique-to-piragua experience. So, tamarindo is good, but if it’s really hot I just like a good lemon.
13. FM: What advice would you give to young and aspiring actors, playwrights, or people generally interested in pursuing theater?
LMM: When I was fighting to write a full-length musical, I really said, “What do I know? And what do I feel like I know how to say well?” That’s the only thing you can do, and if you find a vessel with which to do it, more power to you. Heights was not autobiographical, but was based on characters I felt like I knew in real life. It was fun writing through them, but there’s shortcut to that. If you just want to write a musical and you don’t know what it’s about, I think, first of all, pick a world you think sings or could benefit from singing, and then find a type of music as you’re writing that either meshes with that world or is so different from that world that it’s interesting. That’s about all the advice I can give you. That’s where I started.
14. FM: This is risky, but I’m going to ask it anyway: can you come up with a little two or three line freestyle about your trip to Harvard on the spot?
LMM: (Laughs.) Yeah, how about:
Going to Harvard despite the high cost /
I’m really very sorry your Patriots lost.
15. FM: Finally, I’m assuming since you’re from New York you know all about Jeremy Lin right now?
LMM: Yeah, it’s really fucked up my Google alerts—no, he’s awesome, he’s awesome. That’s a joke, but he’s awesome!
FM: So the question is: who has more street cred, Lin-Manuel or Jeremy Lin?
LMM: Oh, sports is always going to beat theater in street cred any day of the week. But he’s awesome. I’m really proud. It’s the first I’ve followed the Knicks since, like, Patrick Ewing days, so I’m really happy he’s breathed life into our team. So thanks, Harvard!

When I was 10 years old, my parents gently suggested that I pick up accordion as a hobby. It was an unusual request, maybe, but not wholly random: they had listened to accordion music growing up in China, where it’s still a commonly studied musical instrument, and they thought I’d enjoy a hobby that few others my age did as well. To that end, my dad found an old, German accordion on eBay and proudly acquired it for $60. That was how much it was worth, really, and the instrument itself was clearly on its last legs—the right-hand piano keys were yellowed and stiff, and the bellows huffed and wheezed as I practiced and played. I felt old just playing it, but for whatever reason, I liked the feel. It was different.
At first, I tried to learn to play by watching instructional videotapes my parents bought through the mail. This wasn’t very productive; most of the videos featured the same guy, looking middle-aged and lame, who played cheesy songs and asked me to repeat after him. I ditched this guy pretty quickly and my mom, resourceful as ever, placed an ad in the local Chinese newspaper to seek out somebody willing to teach a novice accordion student. We got a reply soon after from a lady named Mrs. Dai, teaching out of her home in Westfield an hour away.
We settled on a regular lesson time—Saturdays, from 5 to 6 p.m.—and I began to learn the repertoire of the classical accordion. I learned to play Polish polkas, Spanish tangos, and Hungarian folk melodies, and I learned to look like I knew what I was doing. I was Mrs. Dai’s only student, actually, and she took personal pride in teaching me to become a concert accordionist. My very first lesson with Mrs. Dai began with learning how to properly “wear” my accordion—how to take it out of the case, adjust the straps—which is more important than it sounds. As she told me, “It’s easy for people not to take you seriously when you play accordion. This is unfortunate, but you can earn their respect by approaching the instrument seriously.”
I studied accordion all through middle school, and the drive to my lesson each Saturday afternoon became a regular part of my life. Between the sixth and the ninth grades, Saturdays were never mine to have: some mornings I’d have swim meets, and most afternoons would be swallowed by Chinese school, followed by the hour-long commute up Route 22 to Mrs. Dai’s. For people who make fun of New Jersey, the view along Route 22 doesn’t dispel any prejudices about the apparently misnamed Garden State. Driving up the highway with my dad each week was like watching a documentary on strip malls—a muted tour through the kind of commuter malaise that lives a daily existence on endless asphalt trails.
It wasn’t altogether tiresome or boring, though. Every week, my dad and I would listen to the same National Public Radio programs: “Wait Wait...Don’t Tell Me!” on the way there and “A Prairie Home Companion” on the way back. My parents are avid NPR listeners—that is, they were way before it was cool with the Urban Outfitters-types—and, somehow, listening to NPR together was one of the few things that I could do with my parents and not feel lame in doing so. In fact, the hours spent driving past rows of dreary boutique stores and unappealingly-named restaurants like “Texas Weiner II” were some of the few times I’d see my dad laugh. I mean, really laugh—not like a parent’s polite chuckle at a kid’s middle school play because the little actors and actresses would feel stranded onstage if you didn’t, but the kind of laugh that happens because you can’t help but, it’s so funny.
My dad, a lab researcher whose personality might be euphemistically described as “reserved,” especially loved “A Prairie Home Companion.” He liked the recurring skits like “Guy Noir, Private Eye,” and laughed at most every joke, checking to make sure that I got it, too. I looked forward to our weekly drives through the heartland of New Jersey’s commuter territory, and I looked forward to sharing a laugh with my dad when Garrison Keillor would come on the air and talk about the happenings-around-town in Lake Wobegon.
I stopped playing accordion midway through the ninth grade when school started to really pick up, and my dad and I no longer went to see Mrs. Dai every Saturday afternoon. This also meant that we didn’t stop by at Wendy’s on the way home on Saturdays, and that I’d stop my habit of always ordering the same at the drive-thru: the spicy chicken sandwich, with a cup of floppy fries and a Sprite. We used to always share fries, and I’d always remember to ask for more ketchup at the drive-thru because that was one of my dad’s favorite recurring parts from “A Prairie Home Companion”: a PSA about ketchup and its value as a “natural mellowing agent”—funny jingle included. No matter how many times my dad heard Garrison Keillor extolling the virtues of ketchup, somehow, he’d find it funny and laugh, and I would, too.

Around 8 p.m. on a Friday, the basement of Adams D entryway is almost as eerie as the courtyard outside–the harsh lights above emphasizing the emptiness of the corridors. But a few moments after descending the stairs on the way to E entry, a warmer light from a room off the hallway attracts attention, and a scribbled-on blackboard comes into view: “The Molotov,” it reads, in bright colors and flowery script.
The blackboard is a menu, listing beverages and salads and advertising “explosive flavor” in faded colored chalk: eggplant and arugula, a soy cheese sandwich of the day, tomato bisque, and espresso with flavor shots.
Yellow paint covers the brick and cement walls reflects light through the small room. There is a mini kitchen in the corner, some cabinets underneath the counter, the wooden frame of what must have been more, and a tall white fridge. The ceiling hangs low overhead, a web of tangled piping. Three circular glass tables line the wall next to a longer wooden table; a sofa sits next to a TV on the other side of the room. Someone is working on the couch but only his legs, extended onto the low coffee table in front of him, are visible from behind the wall obscuring his face.
This is the Molotov Café—or what’s left of the student initiative that has been open intermittently over the past two decades. At times a buzzing center for Adams residents, the room today stands somewhat forgotten, save for the occasional groups who gather to watch sports games here, or those who go to study expecting the silence, the emptiness.
The small basement space has been shaped and remolded by students over the years, and its history as a student center extends well into the past even before its role as a café. The room was originally designated for storage space, until Peter M. Sellars ’80 decided to turn it into a theater during his sophomore year in the late ’70s, asking for $25 to make the necessary changes. “I thought he was kidding,” then-Adams House Master Robert J. Kiely said in an email.
But he cleared out the junk, painted it, and called it “Explosives B”—after a sign for a factory that he had found. The theater, showing weekly productions, sat around 30 people on mattresses on the floor, but soon became what Kiely describes as “one of the best, most popular little theaters on campus.” The small theater, described in a 1982 article in The Crimson as a “cramped little room under the pipes, with its black drapes and grilled slits of windows and 25 rickety wooden chairs at most,” hosted plays so successful that students trying to get in lined up on Plympton St. all the way to the Harvard Bookstore.
Later in the decade, the basement space was repainted black, filled with student-made furniture and artwork, and became a VCR room. Screening avant-garde films, the space was renamed the Explosives B Cabaret Telly Lounge & Cafe Gluttony Video Institute, an indication of Adams’ affiliation with creative and unconventional types. Finally, after various reincarnations and renamings, the room’s popularity faded for a couple years in the early ’90s.
MEET ME AT THE MOLOTOV
Explosives B attracted excitement again as the new Molotov Café in 1994 when Rita L. Berardino ’94, a former HoCo chair who wanted to keep her involvement in the House strong even during her final semester at the College, decided to start the business and reuse the space. In its first form, the café sold cookies at only 25 cents apiece, as well as coffee, tea, and hot chocolate for double that price. Berardino baked and brewed with the help of some friends; students worked simply out of interest and were not paid. In a 1994 Crimson article, Berardino described the effort as a “labor of love” born out of a need for the revival of such a social center within the House.
But the café never became a centrally organized effort, and different versions of the Molotov popped up here and there over the years to serve varying needs—it became a space for student gatherings, a spot to hold poetry readings and artistic performances, a hub where student playwrights frequently met. A few years back, a small group of friends re-opened the café for the last time, only concerned with making enough profit to purchase the supplies for their next night of business, and the Molotov officially stopped operating between 2008 and 2009. Its existence, however, has played a visible role in the history of Adams house as a relic of its artsy vibe and culture: One of the many paintings in the houses’ tunnels reads, “Meet me at the Molotov,” and over the years students have done just that, finding solace in the quirky space.
FINDING ITS LEGS
The café’s functioning was simply a matter of finding someone to take the initiative to restart it, according to Antone Martinho III ’13, the Adams HoCo Special Projects Chair, who is spearheading an effort to have the café officially up and running for good. After a HoCo effort last year to get more students to start using the space regularly, Martinho and the rest of HoCo, along with Adams House Allston Burr Resident Dean Sharon L. Howell and Adams Housemasters and staff, decided to make the idea that he explains “has been kicked around the house for the past couple years” a reality.
Right now, Martinho said, “people see it as the café that was, rather than the open space that is.” The new café will look to bring students together again in a fully functional center. “We’re trying to revive the same feeling [of the old Molotov] but to give it something new so that it has a new life,” said Joseph Brancale ’13, an Adams HoCo Chair.
But although the new café will draw on the success of its past, there’s not much of the original Molotov that Martinho plans to keep. The first thing he did when clearing out the space, he explained, was to remove the mannequin legs that hung from the ceiling and window, a mysterious leftover of one of the café’s reiterations.
“It’s not coming back as the Molotov,” said Martinho.  He hopes to turn the give the new space a “café-pub feel” that will appeal to a more general public, reshaping it from the prior niche café by repainting it, adding new décor, and even giving it a new name. Also unlike the original café, Martinho hopes to have café employees’ work subsidized through work-study or through the profits of the café itself, another means of ensuring its stability.
This revamped setting will offer an environment conducive to both socializing and quiet study as a community space:  “It will be halfway between the quiet of the library and full-on socializing,” Martinho explained. The space will initially sell drinks, small snacks, and pastries, and the team hopes to hold other events, like the House’s Carpe Noctum Stein Club in the space as well.This once again renamed café will restore the Molotov of old soon, he said. “Our tentative goal—don’t hold your breath, but try to hold us to it—is to open it by spring break.”

When he was a high school junior, Matthew J. Devino ’13 saw a documentary that showed beating human heart tissue, derived from human stem cells, in a petri dish. The image captivated him. Three years later, during his sopohomore year at Harvard, Devino made living human heart tissue himself using human RNA-induced pluripotent stem cells. “It was the fulfillment of a huge dream,” remembers Devino.
Devino graduated from high school in the spring of 2009, around the time that Harvard announced a new concentration in Human Developmental and Regenerative Biology that would allow students to pursue stem cell research during their undergraduate years. The HDRB concentration was the main reason why he chose to attend.
Harvard is at the center of the field of stem cell research. “You have a scale and a depth and breadth of expertise in one small geography that literally is unparalleled elsewhere,” says Brock C. Reeve, executive director of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute—a collaboration of Harvard-affiliated scientists and clinicians, and the largest of its kind.
In designing the concentration, particular attention was paid to the way stem cell research and its applications could best be taught to undergraduates. Recent years have witnessed new attention being given to the subject within disciplines ranging from ethics to the history of science.
FROM THE LAB TO THE CLASSROOM
Harvard Medical School professors David T. Scadden and Douglas A. Melton are the co-directors of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute, which they helped launch in 2004.Scadden explains that, with his background as a practicing physician and Melton’s as a molecular embryologist, their partnership combined two important components of the study of stem cells. “That spans the whole spectrum represented by our Harvard community,” says Scadden, proceeding to explain that the program aimed to help people work together to accelerate advances in the field.
In 2007, students from across the University were first able to take classes in a newly founded department, Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology. Scadden and Melton co-founded SCRB, as well as the HDRB concentration, which examines the science of stem cells as well as human development more generally. According to Harvard College Facebook, 54 sophomores enrolled in the concentration this year.
Scadden explains that HDRB emphasizes a different way of teaching science. “Science is often perceived as a set of facts learned by others,” says Scadden. “We thought [SCRB] was a great way to get people engaged in what are very real problems that they could relate to, with the new technology of stem cells and lots of opportunities for learning new things that are specific to it, and yet be teaching basic principles of biology.”
SCRB faculty members incorporate classroom learning, research, and clinical applications in their courses. Working in a lab is a requirement for HDRB concentrators.
A MULTIDISCIPLINARY APPROACH
Departments are also interested in approaching advancements in biotechnologies through an ethical lens. Widely referred to as bioethics, this sort of teaching encompasses two main methodologies: a broader philosophical approach and a more specific look at relevant case studies, a methodology called science and technology studies.
Undergraduates can explore the philosophical side of bioethics by taking Life Sciences 60: “Ethics, Biotechnology, and the Future of Human Nature,” a course taught by Melton and Michael J. Sandel, best known for his course Ethical Reasoning 22: “Justice” and leader of the Program in Ethics and Public Policy at the Harvard Stem Cell Institute. By combining Melton’s expertise as a scientist with Sandel’s political philosophy background, the course examines the ethical implications of scientific developments.
“Professor Melton presents the scientific background to current bioethics controversies, and I lead discussion of the ethical questions raised by new biotechnologies—including stem cell research, genetic engineering, and neuroethics,” writes Sandel in an email.
“We want students to understand the reasons for their moral assessments and encourage students to think through their own positions,” says Kerstin Haase, head Teaching Fellow of the course. Haase mentions performance-enhancing drugs and embryo screening as examples of the kinds of morally ambiguous topics the course addresses.
A smaller course called History of Science 253: “Bioethics, Law, and the Life Sciences,” taught by Sheila Jasanoff, provides an alternative approach to bioethics. Sandel and Melton’s class begins with the science and uses knowledge of that science to help students define their own moral views. Jasanoff’s course, a seminar offered jointly by the College and the Kennedy School, is grounded in science and technology studies. It consists of case studies that allow students to examine specific scientific and policy situations and then build theories from their observations.
“We are quite deficient as a society and as an establishment if we’re not also paying attention to how things work out in practice and on the whole,” Jasanoff says. Because of this, her work aims to “not just look at what people say bioethics is, [but] look at what people are doing when they perform bioethics.”
S. Alison Kraemer ’12 is taking Jasanoff’s course as well as Sandel and Melton’s. “With the Sandel class, I get to figure out how to morally reason my own ideas of right and wrong,” she says. “[Jasanoff] focuses on how institutions and bodies within society help make decisions that bring into question our way of deciding right and wrong.”
Jasanoff thinks that students are often unaware that there are two different approaches to understanding bioethics, both of them vital. “We don’t have a place where we can discuss what the differences in approaches are and why those differences matter and what training one should have in order to understand bioethics as a whole,” she says. “There is a deeper question about how we should think about ethics at the changing frontiers of science and technology writ large.”
BRIDGING THE GAP
Kraemer believes that all HDRB students should be interested in bioethics. “I don’t think you should go into the concentration being blind to them, and I don’t think anyone is,” she says.
Kraemer is taking a supervised research course that relates HDRB to the history of science and bioethics in order to study the ways in which public policy pressures have influenced the shift in focus from embryonic stem cells to non-embryonic stem cells. This type of interdisciplinary work reflects the way in which Harvard prepares undergraduates to grapple with the complexity of stem cell research from a variety of angles. From labs to clinics and discussions to lectures, Harvard continues to expand conceptions of what research can accomplish and how its implications can be examined in academic circles.

Seated at Grafton Street Pub & Grill with a child-size glass of Guinness in hand, Professor Harvey Claflin Mansfield ’53, Harvard’s soft-spoken firebrand, has no intention of upturning the reputation he has earned during the nearly five decades he has spent teaching at his alma mater.
Even today, within a month of his eightieth birthday, Mansfield still relishes the battles he has fought over the years. Facing off against feminists, liberals, the new left, any enforcer of the politically correct, easy graders, and fresh young minds, Mansfield hasn’t pulled any punches. He has been a vigorous opponent of the Ivory Tower’s conventional wisdom. He’s against race and gender-based affirmative action. He categorically opposes gender studies departments. He puts the Constitution on a pedestal. He thinks women, in general, should be expected to earn less than men. He wrote a book entitled “Manliness,” a defense of traditional gender roles. In 2008, he hosted “The Conference the Radcliffe Institute Didn’t Want to Host.” He’s an unyielding critic of grade inflation, earning the moniker Harvey “C-minus” Mansfield. He even opposed Harvard’s course evaluation tool.
You could call him a polemic. But then you might be missing the point.
“Sometimes I think if Harvard was just as conservative as it is liberal now, I wouldn’t be a conservative,” Mansfield reflects, eating a BLT with avocado and picking at greens instead of French fries—even the great arbiter of manliness must bow to the requirements of old age.
Harvey Mansfield entertaining the thought that he could be himself without being a conservative—this idea seems pretty far from any regular conception of the Mansfieldian Platonic ideal. The words “I wouldn’t be a conservative” come from the same person who minutes later labels himself a “conservative Republican with the emphasis on Republican rather than conservative—because I like to win.”
The passing mention is not a half-hearted apology for decades spent as Harvard’s head heretic. He is not apologizing. In fact, Harvey Mansfield is first and foremost a philosopher—a man who has spent his career thinking about big ideas, a man who only half-jokingly lists John Rawls among his chief rivals. The idea of a Mansfield without conservative values is, like everything he touches, more complicated than it seems—or maybe more complicated than he likes to let on. Perhaps after spending a lifetime studying Nietzsche and Machiavelli, he understands the joy of the aphorism, of the provocative remark.
“I believe that Harvey is a provocateur, but I do not believe that Harvey is a superficial provocateur or an insincere one,” says Sharon R. Krause, a left-leaning political science professor at Brown University and a former Harvard government department Ph.D. student advised and mentored by Mansfield. “I believe that the position he defends, he believes he has good grounds for. But, he sees the limits of beliefs or convictions—even convictions that he believes are sound.”
Mansfield might be a man driven by the primacy of his conservative values, but maybe it is the confrontation itself that has kept him fighting.
***
Mansfield was born March 21, 1932, in New Haven, Conn. He arrived at Harvard—the son of Harvey C. Mansfield Sr., a government professor at Columbia—in 1949. Almost without intention, but with plenty of passion, Mansfield immersed himself in the study of government—describing himself as a “grind.” As Mansfield, who went to a public high school, says he was a member of Harvard’s first class to have equal numbers of men from prep schools and public schools, he revels in his own brand of diversity.
After he graduated, he spent one year in England on a Fulbright scholarship and then two years as an enlisted man in the Army.
He received his Ph.D. from Harvard in government in 1961, taught at Berkeley for a couple of years, and then returned to Harvard as a lecturer. In 1969, he was appointed a full professor; he chaired the government department from 1973 to 1976. Today, he is the William R. Kenan Jr. Professor of Government.
During his time as an undergraduate, Mansfield was not yet a neo-conservative; he was a liberal. In a straw poll in the 1950s, he even voted for Adlai Stevenson.
Then, in the late 1950s, Mansfield recalls—employing a phrase coined by the neo-conservative thinker Irving Kristol—getting “mugged by reality.” His transformation came in two parts. First, Mansfield discovered Leo Strauss, a Jewish-German political philosopher who has had a sustained impact on Mansfield’s scholarship and worldview. Strauss’ views on history and the classics naturally translated into a conservative school of thought, Mansfield says. Second, the protests that erupted in America and on Harvard’s campus during the Vietnam War shaped his political perspective forever.
Paul A. Cantor ’66, an English professor at the University of Virginia who participated in a reading group led by Mansfield during his time at Harvard, says, “When you had these various forms of student protest and politics suddenly intruding on academics, you suddenly had to take political positions because the students were forcing you to. Those events I wouldn’t say politicized him as a teacher, but they made it necessary to make certain political positions.” Cantor recalls, “Students would barge into your class and try to stop you from teaching.”
Mansfield kept teaching.
“Many students refused to go to class after the American invasion of Cambodia, and Harvey Mansfield taught when many other faculty cancelled their classes,” says Nathan Tarcov, who received his government Ph.D. at Harvard under Mansfield’s mentorship.
***
Mansfield has kept teaching—and researching, and writing—for the past five decades, but he says he feels he has been passed over by the academic elite. He mentions, for one, that he’s never been honored by the American Political Science Association. “It doesn’t bother me a whole lot because it goes with the territory,” he says, referring to his conservative convictions and controversial stances.
“I think he has gotten less credit than he deserves...some of that is undoubtedly because of politics, some of it is because his work is difficult,” says William Kristol ’73, a preeminent Republican thinker and the founder of The Weekly Standard. “He hasn’t pulled his punches. I don’t just mean that in a political sense; I mean that in an intellectual sense.”
It’s not that he’s gone entirely unacknowledged, but that the plaudits have come almost exclusively from his fellow conservatives. He’s been to the White House five times: once under Gerald Ford, twice under George H.W. Bush, and twice under George W. Bush. In 2004, he won the National Humanities Medal, and in 2007, he served as the Jefferson Lecturer in the Humanities—“thanks to George W. Bush.”
Amidst academia’s quest for diversity, Mansfield believes that the most important kind—intellectual diversity—has been forgotten. He says he watched the primacy of Western civilization evaporate. The classics have fallen off the canon. Great books are no longer considered indispensable in liberal arts institutions. He sees a government department that has little interest in studying the military or the minutiae of the Constitution. And to make matters worse, faculty members are more and more willing to coddle their students.
Mansfield sees it as his mission to try to attract faculty members to Harvard who will question this “political correctness.” “One of the worst things about democracy is conformism,” he says.
“I get angry,” Mansfield says, breaking his calm and professorial speaking voice. He invokes his favorite foe, “feminists”—which he often applies as a catch-all term for his ideological opponents—and splutters: “They’re so intolerant.”
But conservative academics are routinely overlooked by the University—not on political grounds but because of their old school academic interests, he says. “If you’re from another point of view, you probably study different things.”
The problem transcends Harvard. Mansfield is routinely frustrated when his graduate students don’t get appointments at other universities, and he bristles at the suggestion that this is because of anything other than a bias against their approach. “It’s not just a feeling,” he declares. “It’s an observation.”
Mansfield wants Harvard to practice affirmative action for conservatives. “I think a certain kind of affirmative action—searching out, not quotas,” he says. “Looking out for people who are different from what we have.”
Now with a barer plate in front of him, Mansfield has hit his stride. He cites Commencement speakers as another example of Harvard’s prevailing liberal bias. Then he adds that Harvard Yard has only been shut down for two term-time speeches: Jesse Jackson and Al Gore ’69.
“Harvard never gave an honorary degree to Margaret Thatcher, the mightiest woman of our time,” he rails.
***
He may consider himself first and foremost a political philosopher, but he’s perhaps best known as an antagonist in an area in which he can claim no extensive pedigree: gender. He wrote the book “Manliness” in 2006 and made an appearance on “The Colbert Report” to promote it.
The book argues that men and women have inherent differences due to nature and social construction, and that they should remain different. He says it should be expected that women will earn less than men. He says that women will always be less focused on their careers than men: “I do think they will always be less single-minded,” he says. “They want a family in a way a man does not. I think most women think about being mothers, but a man doesn’t think about being a father until he is one.”
His book was slammed in a New York Times book review. It also received strident criticism in a piece written by Martha C. Nussbaum, a political philosopher at the University of Chicago, appearing in The New Republic entitled “Man Overboard.”
“To begin with, it is slipshod about facts—even the facts that lie at the heart of his argument. He repeatedly tells us that ‘all previous societies have been ruled by males,’ producing Margaret Thatcher as a sole recent exception,” writes Nussbaum in the article, proceeding to refute Mansfield’s claim by citing more than two dozen female leaders missing from his tabulation, including politicians in New Zealand, Turkey, India, France, and Canada.
But in typical Mansfield style, faced with a lengthy recitation of Nussbaum’s critique, he says, “No, I think it’s true: All previous societies have been ruled by men—and Elizabeth. I’ll add Queen Elizabeth to that,” he says. “That’s my concession.”
After some prodding that Nussbaum might be empirically correct, he says: “Those are recent, and they’re not significant.”
“I’ll stick with Margaret Thatcher,” he says.
In the piece’s conclusion, Nussbaum—an esteemed political philosopher who has won a number of mainstream academic awards and honors—writes that “Manliness” has a “lack of definitional clarity,” an “ideological enthusiasm,” and “a tendency to romanticize characters” in a way that makes the book “uncourageous, just when we badly need to think well about how to cultivate true courage.”
Again, asked to respond, he pauses and takes his time to collect his thoughts. “The last thing Martha Nussbaum wants is true courage,” he says, “because true courage would be exercised against her very politically correct position.”
“She’s a classical scholar and philosopher, and she paid no attention to my discussion of Plato and Aristotle in the last two chapters of the book,” he says.
Her piece does, in fact, address Plato and Aristotle. Whether it pays sufficient attention to his discussion is a question that seems unanswerable when faced with unyielding disagreement between two highly credentialed minds.
For her part, Nussbaum writes in the article that Mansfield might not be the patient philosopher but instead be a familiar character from Plato’s dialogues: the sophist. “Far from seeking truth, the sophist seeks to put on a good show. Far from wanting premises that are correct, the sophist seeks premises that his chosen audience will find believable.”
In “Manliness,” Mansfield did not attempt to grapple with homosexuality. He says that he testified on behalf of the “anti-gay” side in a Colorado court case, but that it’s not really his issue. “I don’t care that deeply,” he says about gay marriage. “Some things are bigger problems than others.”
Then, atypically, he acknowledges that social change has brought with it actual progress. He quietly mentions a gay classmate of his who committed suicide. “It’s good that we don’t treat gays in such a way that we used to,” he says.
***
Mansfield does not look like somebody obsessed with manliness. You might have to lean in to hear exactly what he’s saying. He never played varsity sports as an undergraduate. “I’m pretty small,” he says. He is a fan of football (he tries to go to every home game), hockey, and basketball (about Jeremy Lin ’10, he says, “I’m ruing the day that I never saw him play”).
He also played squash socially; Kristol recalls their time spent playing against each other: “He probably won more often than not.” These days, Mansfield makes sure to walk down the stairs from his fourth floor office in the Center for Government and International Studies to get exercise. He looks spry for almost 80, but he’ll need a hip replacement at the end of the spring semester.
Mansfield is going on leave during the 2012-2013 school year. He has no plans to retire, but he says he’s well aware that “senility can sneak up on you.”
Mansfield drives a gray Porsche Boxster, and an old Lexus when he’s going to get the groceries. He has been married three times. His first wife Margaret Dittson Mansfield, the mother of his three children, divorced him and later died in a 1989 automobile accident along with one of his children. He married Delba S. Winthrop, a professor at the Harvard Extension School, who died of cancer in 2006. He has since remarried again, this time to Anna Schmidt, whom he met in Munich during a research professorship there. “She’s the one who opened the taxi door for me,” he says, describing how the pair met.
At Crema Café, Schmidt—a 37-year-old with wavy hair, a fur coat, glasses, and too much energy for 9 a.m.—says her husband is not exactly what you would expect from the author of “Manliness.” When it comes to moving furniture around the house as they renovate the living room, she’s the one doing any heavy lifting. And in debates—which she typically instigates, rather than her more subdued husband—she says she can hold her own. She’s perhaps most critical of her husband not when he talks about feminism but when he spends too much time and energy watching sports.
He is a man who is skeptical of anyone who claims to know truth. “One thing that makes me angry is open and aggressive atheism,” he says. “Religion can be aggressive if it makes you think God is always on your side.”
Today, near 80, he calls himself “just only officially” a Christian. “I respect them,” he says. But: “In practice I don’t believe. In practice I’m one of those two,” he says, referring to atheism and agnosticism. “Philosophers as such are more likely to be skeptics.”
He is a dapper dresser, wearing a coat jacket, a brimmed hat, and a colorful striped tie—the kind that only old men seem to get away with. “He’s one of the best dressed people I know and he cares about it,” says Jerry Weinberger, a political science professor at Michigan State University and a former government department graduate student mentored by Mansfield. “He’s a gentleman. That’s what he is, in all the best meanings of that term.”
Mansfield is old, but he is not a political relic. He says that he is not against social safety net, for instance; he just thinks it is too big and encompasses too much of the middle class. “I’m not a fanatic,” he asserts.
He has picked a candidate for the 2012 Republican nomination. “I would support Romney as the best of what is being offered by the Republicans,” he says.
***
While Mansfield’s public persona is largely tied up in his political and social views, for many of his former students, those attitudes take a back seat to his qualities as a teacher.
“I remember to this day his first lecture: It was so witty,” says Kristol, who went on to get his government Ph.D. under Mansfield. He describes Mansfield’s lectures as “a very unusual combination of incredibly dense on the one hand and incredibly entertaining.” The lectures, Kristol says, were broadly apolitical, but Mansfield took to “taunting the students to break out of their complacence”—an attribute lauded by many of Mansfield’s former students.
“His seminars and lectures were always meticulously crafted; at least for me, they were always designed for and succeeded in prodding students to think through problems themselves. He expected you to learn. He expected you to stand on your own two intellectual feet,” Weinberger says.
Mansfield says that Harvard hasn’t given him a single award—except his 1993 Levenson Memorial Teaching Prize, from which he derives a healthy amount of pride. “Maybe I’m more of a teacher than most people are,” he says.
He tends to score above the average for the social sciences on the Q course evaluation tool, the same tool he once outspokenly opposed. The comments on his course Government 1061: “The History of Modern Political Philosophy” warn of a dense reading list—Machiavelli, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau—while at the same time offering whole-hearted endorsements.
One comment reads: “Be ready for a lot of reading, but if you are into deeper questions, you will really enjoy this course. It doesn’t focus on details, but talks about the bigger questions of life and politics, and focuses on philosophizing instead of memorizing.”
Mansfield teaches philosophical texts that are sometimes centuries old, and he tries to push students to consider the possibility that the claims in the texts are true. Unlike some philosophers who see a general march forward in intellectual thought, Mansfield pushes his students to consider the possibility that these ancient texts got it right—and that maybe it was in the time that followed that people went astray.
“He made these books speak for themselves. That’s a great gift. It’s in a way uncomfortable, because when these books speak for themselves, they shake you up,” Weinberger says. “Every book that I studied with him, we took it seriously like it had been written yesterday.”
His fellow professor in the government department Michael E. Rosen says the reason for Mansfield’s effectiveness as a teacher is obvious. “He’s someone who’s intensely engaged with individuals and text. You can tell this is someone who’s read with extraordinary care and loves what he’s reading,” he says.
Yet one would be remiss to describe Mansfield as a teacher without acknowledging his abilities as a performer. Mark Lilla, a professor at Columbia and former Harvard government graduate student mentored by Mansfield, fondly recalls his time spent in Mansfield’s class. “Political philosophy suddenly seemed urgent,” he wrote in an email. “And he was unbelievably droll. He liked making slightly racy or un-PC asides now and again, just for the fun of hearing the Harvard hiss return from the students (which meant they were awake).”
***
To truly understand Harvey C. Mansfield—a man whose solution to grade inflation at Harvard is to give students one grade, the one they deserve, and then another, the ironic grade, which goes to the Registrar—you have to realize that he tries to think outside history. Or, at least, he likes to pay a bit more deference to the old ways than the rest of us.
His is an uncommon voice at Harvard, broadly opposing the notion that progress is for the better. “Society always takes things for granted,” he says. “If one looks at modernity from the outside, one is not so impressed by the latest thing or the newest thing.”
Perhaps Mansfield stumbled into his role as provocateur by dint of his conservative worldview, but this script has become one that he acts out with both intellectual honesty and an understated self-awareness. No one will ever know for sure what Mansfield would be like at a conservative Harvard. In this world, however, he has become one of the most visible elements of intellectual life on campus. Some might say that his clamorous dissent has done more harm than good. On the other hand, even if his views lose out in the march of history, there’s something to be said for Mansfield dragging his heels and throwing intellectual barbs along the way. Maybe it means that progress comes with more honesty.
Mansfield recalls a time when the University of Chicago offered him a position on their faculty. Harvard’s government department chair at the time asked Mansfield not to leave, calling him the department’s balance. “I don’t count as diversity,” he scoffs. “I count as balance.”
But despite his frustrations, he has a deep affection for Harvard and his many friends among the faculty. “I love Harvard,” he says. “But I have my quarrels.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren hit the road this week in an effort to tap into the pocketbooks of wealthy Democrats around the country as her Senate campaign gains momentum nationwide.
Warren made pit stops at fundraisers in Philadelphia and Denver yesterday while en route to California, where she will spend several days fundraising and visiting family. She will hold a campaign event in San Diego Thursday before making the short trip north to Santa Monica for a high-profile fundraiser that evening at the home of entertainment attorney Skip Brittenham and actress Heather Thomas.
Democrats said that Warren’s stop in California is a sign of her candidacy’s growing prominence on the national political scene. The race in Massachusetts is one of the most important in the country this fall, and Warren’s bid has become something of a cause célèbre among Democratic activists, with 61 percent of campaign donations coming from outside of her home state.
“Anybody’s who’s a superstar they bring to California. That’s the bottom line,” Los Angeles Democratic Party Chairman Eric C. Bauman said. “California is always a key destination for major Democratic candidates from across the country as we have many very significant Democratic donors in our state.”
The fundraising trip to the West Coast this week is not the first of her campaign. Warren attended a fundraiser co-hosted by television producer Norman Lear and actress Barbara Streisand on her behalf in early November.
Warren has already raised nearly a million dollars in California—almost 20 percent of which is comprised of individual contributions—according to Federal Election Commission documents. Much of that support has come from Hollywood, where big names have lined up to donate and spread the campaign’s message. In addition to Streisand and Lear, the campaign has received donations from actor Danny DeVito, composer Hans Zimmer, and producer Jeffrey Katzenberg.
Though the City of Angels is typically a Democratic fundraising hotspot, Bauman said Warren is attracting more attention and support than usual.
“You have who she is as a person and what she stands for—which is very motivating to Democratic donors and activists,” Bauman said. “And on the other hand you have her as someone who has a very real possibility of taking away a Republican seat, and on top of that the seat she’s trying to take back is Teddy Kennedy’s.”
Warren’s campaign stops in the golden state have garnered criticism from some Republicans.
The Massachusetts Republican Party released an online video advertisement Wednesday painting Warren as Hollywood’s “It Girl.” The black and white newsreel-style ad highlighted Lear’s fundraiser—calling it Warren’s “debutante ball”—and suggested the consumer advocate was a hypocritical elitist for accepting money from wealthy donors.
Democrats have dismissed the advertisement as a political diversion.
“Tomorrow, Scott Brown will vote for an extreme bill he co-sponsored that will allow employers and insurance companies to deny women coverage for contraception, prenatal care and any other health care they need, so it’s no surprise that today, one of Wall Street’s favorite Senators is trying to change the subject,” Massachusetts Democratic Party Communications Director Kevin Franck wrote in a statement.
Sen. Scott Brown made his own two-day fundraising trip through Florida last week with Sen. Marco Rubio but has raised the majority of his money, 66 percent, within Massachusetts.

Two monkeys have died at the Harvard Medical School’s New England Primate Research Center in the past three months, resulting in the suspension of all new experiments at the Center indefinitely.
These most recent deaths boosted the total number of primates deaths in Harvard research facilities to five in the past 19 months, leading Dean of the Medical School Jeffrey S. Flier to halt experimentation at NEPRC.
A cotton-top tamarin monkey died Sunday at the NEPRC, the Boston Globe reported Wednesday. The cause of death is under investigation. According to the Boston Globe, the monkey did not have a water bottle in its cage, which may have been a factor in its death.
In December, a squirrel monkey died from dehydration at the NEPRC, located in Southborough. In response to the squirrel monkey’s death, the United States Department of Agriculture cited the Medical School in a Feb. 3 report for failing to adhere to the Animal Welfare Act.
The report states that an additional monkey was also dehydrated but responded to treatment and recovered.
In the report Paula S. Gladue, a veterinary medical officer inspector who conducted the Jan. 31 inspection, cites NEPRC for failing to ensure that the monkey’s water dispenser was functioning properly.
USDA spokesperson David Sacks wrote in an email to The Crimson that the recent primate deaths have put the Medical School on the USDA’s radar because the recent deaths are “not the norm” at research facilities. “We are very concerned with this string of monkey deaths,” Sacks wrote.
Sacks added that the USDA is currently conducting an investigation and will determine the penalty for the Medical School. A USDA citation can result in a warning letter to the offending institution or a fine of up to $10,000.
“These are indeed serious non-compliances at Harvard, and the university knows it needs to do a much better job of ensuring the welfare of its animals,” Sacks wrote. “We will continue to closely monitor their research facilities in the days and months ahead.”
Flier said that the animal deaths are “absolutely unacceptable, deeply regrettable and personally disturbing to me.” Flier also said he plans to implement a three-step plan to correct the failing protocol.
In addition to freezing new research on primates, Flier will create a team of veterinary staff and supervisors who will monitor animals and procedures more frequently.
Additionally, the Medical School is commissioning an independent review committee of outside experts to assess and advise the NEPRC’s corrective efforts.
In October of last year, NEPRC was cited by the USDA for multiple violations of the Animal Welfare Act—namely the Oct. 2011 death of a primate that died soon after escaping from its cage. The primate was then captured with a net by NEPRC staff, and died after undergoing an imaging procedure. At a separate research facility, a primate died in Feb. 2011 due to anesthesia overdose.
In June 2010, a primate was found dead in a cage after it allegedly went through a mechanical washer.

A new ranking system implemented by Medicare, aimed at identifying hospitals with patient safety risks, is generating complaints from the teaching hospitals affiliated with Harvard Medical School that these assessments provide inadequate representations of the quality of care.
The new system will cut the reimbursements that hospitals receive as incentive for them to improve their overall health care.
Gregg S. Meyer, senior vice president for quality and safety at the Massachusetts General Hospital and lecturer at the Medical School, was involved in the original research used to create the ranking system.
Meyer said that he believes that the system is not accurate enough to predict whether or not a hospital has health risks.
Meyer said that the question that the researchers asked while creating the system was whether or not they could use administrative data to generate hypotheses about patient problems.
He added that the system worked well for the purpose of self-improvement within individual hospitals, but that Medicare’s application is different.
“The analogy is that you put blinds on a person, ask them if there is a light on, and then when they say yes, you ask them to read fine print” Meyer said. “It doesn’t capture how patients are cured or how some hospitals work with more or less privileged patients.”
Kenneth E. F. Sands, senior vice president of health care quality at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and an associate professor at the Medical School, believes that changes should be made in how the system codes for information.
“Variability in how information is coded in hospitals can cause things to look like complications when they are not,” he said. “Take accidental punctures/lacerations. A clinician would think that requires major patient care or rehospitalization, while in reality it could be that a surgeon was working with XYZ artery and nicked the liver during the surgery. It did not lengthen the surgery or have adverse effects, but the coder will have to put accidental puncture/laceration.”
According to Sands, the implementation of the ranking system in its current form could result in two potential outcomes.
“One, there will be an inappropriate redistribution of reimbursement done by an inadequate ranking, and two, it risks damage to reputations of these hospitals,” he said.
Both Sands and Meyer agreed that the ranking system has the potential to stimulate improvement in hospital care, but that the current form is not optimal.
Meyer said that while he is still proud of the research, it was intended for use by individual hospitals for self-assessment purposes—not as a tool for the government to judge medical practices in hospitals.
“If you’re not doing well, you will be docked some pay,” Meyer said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first time, Harvard announced that it will engage residents in an open process to select a developer for Barry’s Corner at the Harvard-Allston Task Force meeting Wednesday night. This new, more inclusive strategy follows two years during which Harvard halted construction in Allston and tensions festered.
In addition to soliciting criteria from residents during Task Force meetings, the University will include two Task Force members on its seven-person selection committee, according to University associate vice president for public affairs and communications Kevin Casey.
The committee will compile a short list of developers, who will then undergo a final round of interviews. Harvard Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp is expected to announce the selected developer for the Barry’s Corner project on June 1.
Harvard has never before worked this closely with community members in the selection of a developer, Casey said.
“We have a goal to try and engage the community in some different ways than we have before and in some creative ways that may be uncharacteristic of Harvard,” Casey said.
This resumed development follows a two years of tension, during which Allston residents—uncertain that the University would restart construction—expressed dissatisfaction with Harvard.Many decried Harvard for breaking its promise to create a “main street” environment in Lower Allston, a goal which will be achieved in part by the Barry’s Corner development, according to the University.
Harvard halted development in Allston in Dec. 2009 after the financial crisis dealt a heavy blow to the University’s endowment.
While many community members expressed enthusiasm for the committee’s transparency and inclusiveness, others were skeptical of the University’s ability to successfully take account of residents’ interests and the interests of the University and developer.
“The effort to include the committee are really encouraging to me,” said Task Force member and Allston resident Bruce E. Houghton. “I really appreciate the thought and effort that [Harvard] put into this and the openness of the housing you’re going to build. I look forward to that sort of atmosphere of inclusiveness and participation in the future.”
In the past, Task Force members and other residents have said they have felt excluded from Harvard’s planning.
Several Task Force members said that some of the parameters Harvard has already set for the Barry’s Corner site—such as only offering units at market rate—have already put the University’s goals at odds with the hopes of Allston residents.
“I firmly believe that mixed-income housing makes for a healthier community,” said Task Force member Brent C. Whelan ’73. “I’m worried that the University’s criteria are not going to allow for this idea that is very important to a lot of us.”
Harvard officials said that the housing on Barry’s Corner may have some opportunity for mixed-income housing after the project is reviewed under the city of Boston’s Article 80.
Harvard also revealed the expected perimeter of the Barry’s Corner site. The University expects the site will be bound by Western Avenue, North Harvard Street, Soldier’s Field, and the Harvard Allston Education Portal.
This announcement was met with criticism from some Allston residents, who said that the site was smaller than they had expected.
Community members also worried that the density of the site might limit its potential.
“I think this is very under-whelming,” said Task Force member Harry E. Mattison. “Harvard’s not going to create a focus for North Allston activity in that one little corner.”
Amidst this skepticism, the University and the Boston Redevelopment Authority stressed the importance of open dialogue with the community.“We are starting a process.
If Harvard, developer, or community demands too much then the project could be unfeasible,” said Mahmood Malihi, an executive vice president of Leggat McCall Properties, the firm hired by Harvard to advise the University on its Allston planning.
“We’re hoping to draft a plan that is in line with Harvard’s goals and with the community’s goals.”

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: March 1
An earlier version of this article stated that the expected perimeters of the Barry’s Corner development project are Western Avenue, North Harvard Street, Soldier’s Field, and the Innovation Lab. In fact, the development will be bordered not by the Innovation Lab but by the Harvard Allston Education Portal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With departmental budget proposals for the 2013 fiscal year due earlier this month, many department administrators in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ smaller departments said that the funds available to them have not increased since the 2008 financial crisis.
“We’re not making radical cuts the way we were during the worst part of the financial crisis, but we’re also not reinstating things we cut,” said Julie A. Buckler, chair of the department of Slavic Languages and Literature. “We’re holding steady.”
Budget cuts over the last few years have proven effective in returning FAS to financial stability and the budget is on track to reach a “structural, long-term balance by the end of the current fiscal year,” Associate Dean for Finance Eric Kopstain wrote in an email.
Yet several department administrators said there is little indication that their departments will see the financial austerity relax in the near future.
“We’ve stayed flat, with the exception of payroll,” said another department administrator in the humanities, who wished to remain anonymous due to the confidential nature of departmental budgets. “This is the new normal.”
Janet Hatch, director of administration in the History department, said she is bracing her department for the continued challenges of a leaner operation.
“We still have to be careful, and careful going forward. There is no indication that things are going to suddenly get better in the future,” she said.
NAVIGATING HARD TIMES
Departments have seen their resources and faculty shrink since Dec. 2008, when Harvard’s endowment decreased in value by nearly 30 percent and FAS Dean Michael D. Smith predicted a decreased in value by nearly 30 percent and FAS Dean Michael D. Smith predicted a two-year, $220 million FAS deficit.
As the value of Harvard’s investments decreased, the 5 to 5.5 percent of the endowment that the University typically allocates for school budgets annually decreased as well.FAS, which relies on interest generated by the endowment for roughly half of its annual budget, saw the distribution it received from the University decrease by 12 percent in the 2010 fiscal year and then 8 percent in FY 2011.
According to one department administrator in the humanities, the period immediately following FAS’s fiscal downturn was marked by collaboration between department administrators and University Hall to determine the scope and scale of the cutbacks.
“I was extremely pleased by how the faculty, staff, and even students came together to help resolve projected shortfalls in our core budget. As a faculty, we spent a lot of time talking about the challenges confronting us and what we had to do to overcome them,” Smith said.
In the current academic year, FY 2012, the FAS deficit decreased to $16 million and distribution to FAS rose by 4 percent. But Smith acknowledged that certain needs remained unfulfilled across a variety of disciplines.
“Everybody feels the impacts of operating under more limited resources than in past years. I don’t think there is a department that doesn’t wish for a bigger budget,” Smith said.
TRIMMING THE FAT
Not all departments are facing the same constraints—for example, four new faculty searches have been authorized in the history department, in addition to another three in economics.But in several small departments, perennial problems such as the loss of faculty to other institutions and faculty retirement still have not been relieved by continued hiring.
For example, the Classics department has yet to receive an authorization for a new tenure-track position even though two junior faculty have left since the financial crisis.Increased oversight over department budgets has been a major result of the fiscal downturn, as department administrators and FAS deans work together to navigate the existing constraints.
One administrator, who also asked to remain anonymous due to the confidential nature of the budgeting process, said that her department was asked to justify each and every part of the budget when the financial crisis first hit.
Some departments have not been able to procure visiting faculty—usually an important resource when permanent hires cannot be made.Other areas of spending have fallen victim to hard times as well. According to Classics department administrator Teresa Wu, the number of department-sponsored lectures has also dropped.
The consequence of this new oversight is a tighter, more efficient allocation of resources, administrators said.“It’s made the faculty aware of what can reasonably be expected,” Hatch said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Lady Gaga and Oprah Winfrey made their way to Sanders Theater for the launch of the Born This Way Foundation, around half a dozen students braved the snow and cold in a demonstration for Their Day in the Yard, a group advocating for posthumous degrees for gay students expelled from Harvard in the 1920s.
Following the demonstration, the group marched through the yard to University President Drew G. Faust’s office to deliver a petition demanding that the University award the students honorary posthumous degrees. The petition has garnered around 5,400 signatures, 400 more than the group’s initial goal.
Their Day in the Yard was founded in June of 2010 by a Harvard student to urge the University to grant degrees to seven students expelled for being gay or perceived to be gay almost a century ago.
The students—two of whom committed suicide after their expulsion—were the targets of an investigation into gay activity at Harvard by a body that has come to be known as the “Secret Court” since a Crimson editor uncovered its existence in 2002.
“They actively discriminated, actively pursued,” said the founder of the group, who has consistently chosen to remain anonymous in the press. “It is the responsibility of current students to hold Harvard accountable for what it did.”
The Los Angeles Times reported on Tuesday that the University rejected the group’s request. A spokesman for the University told the Associated Press that Harvard typically grants posthumous degrees in rare instances in which the deceased student had met all the academic requirements before the degree could be conferred, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Members of Their Day in the Yard said they are now asking the University to grant honorary posthumous degrees because they are easier to award. The demonstration was heavily publicized through email list-servs and Facebook and received coverage on national news outlets.
However, most of the individuals huddled outside Sanders were there to catch a glimpse of Lady Gaga and Oprah Winfrey.
Jonas Wang ’12 was the only student from the College who attended as a supporter of the group.
“Because Harvard is opening doors to the Born This Way Foundation, it’s a great opportunity to point out what Harvard still has to do in terms of it’s own LGBTQ community,” Wang said.
Some of Lady Gaga’s fans ended up listening in as the group’s spokesperson, Kaia Stern, who is a lecturer at the Divinity School, delivered a speech on the activists’ cause, followed by a moment of silence for each of the expelled students.
“Let us remember the unspeakable suffering students experienced at the hands of the secret courts,” Stern said.
The group stressed that their presence was not intended as a protest of Lady Gaga’s foundation or the launch event, but rather was an effort to make her aware of their cause.
“This is not a protest; this is an awareness action,” Stern said. “We are here in solidarity with the Born This Way Foundation.”

Lady Gaga descended on the Harvard campus Wednesday to launch her Born This Way Foundation before a packed audience in Sanders Theatre.
The pop star’s visit caused a stir on campus as fans attempted to score tickets to the event or glimpse the star throughout the day.
Lady Gaga, who shared the stage with Oprah Winfrey, came to Harvard to promote her new youth empowerment organization that combats bullying in schools through grassroots and social media efforts.
By fostering safe school environments, Lady Gaga hopes to make bullying a thing of the past, she said, even if the process of enacting change is slow-going.
“It could be 50 years,” she said. “If I’m dead, I don’t give a shit. I just want it to happen.”
Though she is famous for her stage antics and eccentric outfits, Lady Gaga was uncharacteristically serious during the launch. She said that her role in the anti-bullying movement is “completely separate from the woman I am on stage.”
She wore a black floor length gown, short lace gloves, and a hat with a veil.
Oprah—who bellowed “Harvard” as she ascended to the stage—engaged Lady Gaga in a conversation about the importance of using a multi-strategy approach to end bullying.
A top-down approach of training parents and teachers to tackle bullying is not sufficient, Lady Gaga said.
“This is about changing the school environment,” she said, adding that she hopes it will become more acceptable for students to speak up when they witness harassment.
Lady Gaga also answered questions about her foundation posed by a panel which included author and speaker Deepak Chopra and U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen G. Sebelius.
The panel was moderated by Harvard Law School professor Charles J. Ogletree, who used a gavel to simulate a courtroom debate.Lady Gaga said that her hit song “Born This Way” inspired her to establish the eponymous foundation after her fans began a positive dialogue about the importance of overcoming insecurities following its release.
To ensure that the conversation continued, she felt it was necessary to create a permanent platform to discuss and research bullying issues, she said.
Lady Gaga was accompanied to the launch by her mother, Cynthia Germanotta. University President Drew G. Faust delivered a speech at the event welcoming Lady Gaga to Harvard.
On her part, Lady Gaga expressed enthusiasm at the opportunity to launch the event at Harvard.
“This might be one of the best days of my life,” she said.
Undergraduates shared Lady Gaga’s excitement about her appearance on campus.
A small group of students from College managed to snag tickets to the event through the Undergraduate Council’s raffle and a few less-publicized avenues.
Less fortunate fans waited outside of Memorial Hall during the launch and took photos in front of Lady Gaga’s “Born Brave” bus.
Lady Gaga said the bus will follow her throughout her tour, serving as a roving headquarters for people to become involved in the anti-bullying movement at each of her tour stops.
In honor of her visit, Greenhouse Cafe sold Lady Gaga cupcakes, complete with blonde hair and sunglasses.

Social media websites have had a transformative effect both on authoritarian regimes during the Arab Spring and on current American electoral politics, said journalists and technology advocates on Wednesday night in Kirkland House, the birthplace of Facebook.
Panelist Wael Nawara, journalist and co-founder of Egypt’s El Ghad Party, said Egyptians used Twitter and other websites to create a parallel political sphere that bypassed the country’s state-controlled media and facilitated revolution.
Nawara, who dictated Twitter messages to his son in Canada when the Egyptian government shut down internet access in January 2011, compared regimes attempting to censor social media to rising water in a dam.
"Either they can rise above, or collapse,” he said. “Once this happens, you can’t go back.”
Micah L. Sifry, co-founder of Personal Democracy Media, took a domestic perspective, noting that social media has played a major role in extending the Republican presidential primary by mobilizing sustained support for candidates like Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich.
He also argued that social media is helping to democratize politics, citing its centrality in the formation of movements like the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street.
“We’re just a few years into a huge cultural change that’s about as big as Gutenberg’s perfection of moveable type 500 years ago and the democratization of printing,” he said.
“Imagine—now we all have printing presses in our pockets, and they’re all connected to everybody else.”
Former NPR journalist and current IOP Fellow Farai Chideya emphasized social media’s ability to connect and mobilize people at a time when many feel disillusioned by conventional means of political involvement.
“Social media helped enable a physical movement where people put their bodies on the line and out into the street,” she said.
“Combining the energy of social media and face-to-face can do everything from win elections to topple governments.”
For Michael Shayan ’14 and Lily H. Ostrer ’14, organizers of the “Conversations with Kirkland” series, the event was an opportunity for students to rethink the possibilities of social media.
“For us, it’s really easy to see the role social media plays in our social lives and to not realize the role it can play in the political system internationally,” Ostrer said.
Shayan, who was live-tweeting the event, agreed.
“I think the reason social media is so powerful an inspiring is that it connects people to one another,” he said. “When people connect, there are so many potentialities and possibilities.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students shared difficult personal experiences during two youth summits planned in conjunction with the launch of Lady Gaga’s Born This Way Foundation on Wednesday.
The little monsters—as Lady Gaga’s fans are affectionately described—hailed from nearby colleges and public schools in the Boston and Cambridge area. They were invited to attend the event by Lady Gaga, Oprah, and the California Endowment—a health organization and early partner of the Born This Way Foundation.
The students participated in a summit hosted by the Graduate School of Education called “Preventing Bullying, Creating Caring Communities.”
They were encouraged to reflect on instances in which they acted as bullies or were the victims of bullying.
Lady Gaga made an unexpected appearance at the summit, where she stressed the importance of empowering students to make their communities safer and more accepting of difference.
Massachusetts Secretary of Education Paul Reville, Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino, and Cambridge Public School Superintendent Jeffrey M. Young attended the event and addressed the panel.
At a summit entitled, “Digital Advocacy Boot Camp,” students spent two hours discussing ways to share their stories and raise awareness by using popular sites such as Facebook and Twitter.President and CEO of the California Endowment, Robert K. Ross, first met with Lady Gaga and her mother about a year ago to discuss the burgeoning Born This Way Foundation.
“They were planning the foundation and they came to see us,” Ross said. “We bonded because the issues of youth voice and youth empowerment are critical to the future. Tomorrow is too late. Young people need to be leaders now.”
Ross said he believes that Lady Gaga’s support will help publicize their shared goals.
“Clearly she has a global brand and we wanted our young voices to be plugged into that powerful machine,” Ross said.
Many of the students that attended said that they felt the experience was meaningful and useful.
“I’m inspired to go back to my community,” said Christopher S. Covington, one of the student participants. “It recharged my soul into doing community work.”
Other attendees echoed his sentiments.“I thought it was genuine. The panelists were coming from different perspectives,” said Mark Tran, a youth community organizer for Building Healthy Communities in California.
A representative of Blue State Digital, a firm which advised the Born This Way Foundation, emphasized that the issues are often best communicated through storytelling.
During her launch, Lady Gaga stressed that it was up to the youth to make a difference. Teachers and adults can be helpful, but their efforts will not be as powerful as those spearheaded by students, she said.

Following two recent monkey deaths at Harvard Medical School’s New England Primate Research Center, the interim director of the research facility announced his resignation Thursday morning in an email to people associated with NEPRC.
Dean of the Medical School Jeffrey S. Flier wrote in an email that Medical School professor Frederick Wang had stepped down from his post as interim director to devote more time to his laboratory at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.
Wang was appointed interim director in September. Since then, the NEPRC has received multiple citations from the United States Department of Agriculture—most recently for the death of a cotton-top tamarin monkey on Sunday. The Boston Globe reported that the monkey’s cage did not contain a water bottle, which may have been a factor in the animal’s death.
In December, a squirrel monkey died from dehydration at the NEPRC.
These two deaths bring the total number of primate deaths in Harvard research facilities to five in the past 19 months.
Earlier this week, Flier announced that experimentation at the NEPRC would halt indefinitely until a corrective plan is set in place.
University President Drew G. Faust said in a statement on Thursday that she was “dismayed” to learn about the animals’ deaths.
“This situation is unacceptable,” Faust said. “When I was notified of developments at the primate center over the summer, I found them troubling and fully supported a thorough review of procedures and implementation of reforms.”
As a result of the deaths, Faust added, she has asked for weekly progress reports to monitor primate research and record any difficulties encountered.
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals recently sent a letter to the National Institute of Health demanding that the government agency cease funding research at the NEPRC.
Flier wrote in an email to the NEPRC community that he was “enormously grateful” for the contributions Wang made to the NEPRC during his six-month tenure.
He wrote that Wang “demonstrated superb leadership, establishing numerous procedures and practices to address issues that he personally identified to strengthen not just animal care, but also administration and management.” Flier wrote that he hopes to announce Wang’s successor soon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
February, known for its romantic holiday, did not show much love for former Harvard standout Jeremy Lin ’10, as the latest New York Knicks point guard faced several tough tests against both rookie and veteran opposition. But it did mark the beginning of a brand new romance between New York and Lin, who has taken the city—and the globe—by a storm with his out-of-nowhere and much-needed emergence at the point-guard position. Let's take a look back at the point guards who have had their try at stopping Linsanity and determine who got the best of whom:
Deron Williams (Nets, twice: Feb. 4 W, 99-92; Feb. 20 L 100-92)
Lin: 25 points, 7 assists, 10-19 FG, 1 TO
This was where it all started. Feeling his tenure coming to an abrupt close, Knicks coach Mike D’Antoni took a gamble against New Jersey and put in Lin, then the fourth-string point guard. The Harvard grad proceeded to run circles around a Nets defense that was completely unaware of Lin’s speed and passing ability. Lin outplayed All-Star Deron Williams, who scored 21 points and posted 11 assists, to help the Knicks avoid a third consecutive loss.
Lin: 21 points, 9 assists, 7-18 FG, 3 TO
Williams came into this matchup with a chip on his shoulder, and it showed. The Nets point guard put up a season-high 38 points against Lin and led his underachieving team to an unexpected win at Madison Square Garden.
Winner: Williams created Linsanity, but he also put down his own creation. But, as everyone has credited him with starting the newest NBA sensation, it seems like he will live with this forever. Lin takes this matchup…barely.
Devin Harris (Jazz, Feb. 6 W 99-88)
Lin: 28 points, 8 assists, 10-17 FG, 8 TO 
A former All-Star, Devin Harris has seen a dip in his stats ever since the 2008-09 season. This year’s campaign has been no different. Harris underperformed, as did his team, against Lin and the Knicks, recording only nine points and four assists. Lin was granted his first NBA start, and he certainly delivered.
Winner: This is a win for Lin, no doubt.
John Wall (Wizards, Feb. 8 W 107-93)
Lin: 23 points, 10 assists, 9-14 FG, 2 TO
In a supposed rematch of the 2010 Summer League game that put Lin on the map and helped him earn a spot on the Warriors roster, John Wall fared well, lighting up the Knicks for 29 points and six assists. But his solo performance was not enough to stop Linsanity, which racked up another win during that improbable week.
Winner: The two really went at it, but since Lin got the win without his two All-Star teammates and dunked on an inept Wizards team, the Taiwanese-American gets the win.
Derek Fisher (Lakers, Feb. 10 W 92-85)
Lin: 38 points, 7 assists, 13-23 FG, 6 TO
Under the bright lights of MSG, Lin proved to the world that he was no fleeting wonder. The second-year guard won his third game as a starter by not only hitting big three-pointers to keep the Lakers at bay but also outplaying probable future Hall-of-Famer Kobe Bryant. Derek Fisher showed that the years are weighing him down, failing to contain Lin.
Winner: Fisher should really retire and go fishing. It's clear his best days are behind him.
Ricky Rubio (Timberwolves, Feb. 11 W 100-98)
Lin: 20 points, 8 assists, 8-24 FG, 6 TO 
Ricky Rubio was not fazed by Linsanity, playing true to his passing game and suffocating Lin at times with some stifling defense. Rubio was primarily responsible for making Lin cough up the ball several times, especially in the second half, but Lin ultimately made up for it by hitting big free throws to close out his fourth game at the helm of the Knicks offense.
Winner: Rubio played a pretty passing game, but Lin outscored the Spaniard and was clutch down the stretch. This one goes to Lin.
Jose Calderon (Raptors, Feb. 14 W 90-87)
Lin: 27 points, 11 assists, 9-20 FG, 8 TO
Spanish point guard Jose Calderon put the team on his back, shooting at a high percentage to keep the Raptors in the game. But with a combination of rookie Iman Shumpert’s defense on Calderon in the second half and Lin’s late-game theatrics, the Knicks stole the game, and got the “W” on the road.
Winner: This one would have gone to Calderon had he continued his hot shooting in the second half and had Lin not hit the biggest game-winner of his young career. Lin takes this one by a hair.
Tyreke Evans (Kings, Feb. 15 W 100-85)
Lin: 10 points, 13 assists, 4-6 FG, 6 TO
Lin did not have to score much in order to be effective on the court against the Sacramento Kings. He focused on dishing the ball out to his teammates, and his supporting cast responded by giving Lin a then-career-high 13 assists. It also marked the first time (since that initial game against the Nets) that Lin did not score at least 20 points. Tyreke Evans scored 19 points in the losing effort, and the Kings never really gave the home team much trouble.
Winner: Sacramento looked like a D-League team and Evans couldn't get anything going. Lin's balanced game wins this one.
Greivis Vasquez (Hornets, Feb. 17 L 89-85)
Lin: 26 points, 5 assists, 8-18 FG, 9 TO
Everyone thought that the Linning streak would end with Dallas, not with the 6-23 New Orleans Hornets. But it did, thanks to Greivis Vasquez's 11 assists and Trevor Ariza’s team-high 25 points. The visiting Hornets came out with visibly more energy and the lackadaisical Knicks fell behind for much of the game. Even though Lin got his team within two points in the fourth, the Hornets defense staved off New York to sneak out of MSG with a win. What really hurt the Knicks were Lin’s nine turnovers, his highest total since becoming New York’s starter.
Winner: With Lin’s nine turnovers and the Hornerts’ win, Vasquez deserves the W here.
Jason Kidd (Mavericks, Feb. 19 W 104-97)
Lin: 28 points, 14 assists, 11-20 FG, 7 TO
Lin’s TO problem was already worrying fans, but it didn’t matter as long as the Knicks were winning. This was the case once again against the defending champions. On national TV, Lin and sidekick Steve Novak rallied the Knicks past the Mavericks, despite the fact that New York was down by 12 at the end of the third quarter and Lin had already lost the ball several times. But New York's newest star proved once again that he could hit big-time shots—including one over the seven-foot Dirk Nowitzki—and Novak showed off his marksmanship with four three-pointers in the fourth quarter. Jason Kidd was really nowhere to be found in this game.
Winner: This is a no-brainer: Lin for the win.
Jeff Teague (Hawks, Feb. 22 W 99-82)
Lin: 17 points, 9 assists, 6-11FG, 4 TO
Jeff Teague led an Atlanta Hawks team that was missing two key players, Joe Johnson and Al Horford, with 18 points. Unfortunately for the Hawks, that was probably their only bright spot of the night. New York blew out Atlanta for most of the game, and Lin had an easygoing time before facing the Miami Heat the next day.
Winner: The Knicks were winning by over 30 points midway through the first half—Lin was largely responsible for that. The answer to this one is pretty self-explanatory.
Mario Chalmers (Heat, Feb. 23 L 102-88)
Lin: 8 points, 3 assists, 1-11 FG, 8 TO
Lin looked like the Lin of old against last year’s Eastern Conference champs, the Miami Heat, scoring a measly eight points and turning the ball over eight times. Mario Chalmers, LeBron James, and Joel Anthony did a great job of containing Lin and making him nervous and visibly frustrated. Without a point guard, the New York Knicks quickly unraveled, never really finding an offensive rhythm, a fact that came to a head in the second half.
Winner: Though Chalmers did not have a pretty game offensively either, the Heat point guard did play an important role in his team's defensive scheme. He takes this one.
Next up: Kyrie Irving (Cavaliers, Feb. 29)
A Rookie of the Year front-runner, Kyrie Irving has made the Cleveland Cavaliers somewhat competitive this season, keeping the Cavs within striking distance of the playoffs. Irving is a quick and physical guard and will almost certainly give Lin trouble tonight.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 2008, Harvard women’s hockey team capped off the first-ever perfect run through the East Coast Athletic Conference in a championship game against St. Lawrence in a riveting overtime win in Canton, N.Y.
That night, the Saints persevered through regulation play and a disallowed Crimson goal to force overtime. Just as it appeared as though pressure and history were mounting to deny Harvard its shot at a coveted perfect season, the 5-foot-4 Caitlin Cahow ’08 proved big things do come in small packages. Her shot from the left side found the net and sent the Crimson home with a 3-2 victory, the ECAC title, and perfection.
This year, after sweeping Princeton in the first round of the ECAC playoffs, the No. 8 Harvard women’s hockey team will get a chance to move closer to yet another conference championship.
Thanks to sixth-seeded Quinnipiac’s surprise victory over third-seeded Clarkson, the Crimson will once face the No. 10 Saints, who hold the fifth seed.  The winner of the Friday game in Ithaca, N.Y., will advance to play against the survivor of the matchup between top-ranked Cornell and the Bobcats, in a potentially hostile championship game on Saturday.
St. Lawrence goaltender Carmen MacDonald set a new university record with her sixth shutout of the season last weekend, but the Saints’ defense will have to face a Harvard squad that fires 31.1 shots on net a game and scores an average of 3.68 goals.
At the other end of the ice, the Crimson’s junior goaltender Laura Bellamy, who has started all 31 games this season, will add another interesting dimension. She has continually to shut down opponents in ECAC play, and, in late January, Bellamy recorded three shutouts in as many games to put her team in position for a late winning streak.
Since then, Harvard has won 11 of its last 13 contests, including its last six in a row.
During the span dating back to Jan. 21, the Crimson has decimated its opponents, outscoring them by a combined 35 goals, 56-21.
Excluding the two losses in that period—both of which came in the Beanpot tournament—the No. 8 team in the country has won by an average of more than three and a half goals per game, giving Harvard indispensable experience on the ice.
“It feels like we’ve seen just about everything,” junior forward Jillian Dempsey said. “We should have faith and confidence in ourselves that we can pull it off now because we have done it before.”
The Crimson has also experienced head-to-head success against St. Lawrence. It easily managed two early-season victories over the Saints by scores of 7-1 and 6-1.
Both games featured special teams success as the Harvard power play unit went 6-of-12, and only one shorthanded goal was allowed for St. Lawrence squad in its 15 opportunities.
“We just have to go out there and do it again,” Dempsey said of beating the Saints. “We were all over them. We were buzzing. We were in their face. We were beating them to pucks and putting away rebounds. We were doing a lot of the little things that we pride ourselves on.”
But the Saints will be coming into this weekend’s game on a hot streak of their own. Since dropping a game to Harvard in November, No. 3 Cornell is the only ECAC opponent to which St. Lawrence has fell.
“They are a different team [now],” Dempsey said. “They have turned something on and found a few keys to getting success…. We don’t know what they have done differently, but they have skill, we have skill, and it’s just going to be a matter of who’s whole team shows up ready to work.”
With 20 points in the month of February alone, Dempsey has been a major contributor to the team’s recent success. She started the month by nearly matching an NCAA-record six goals in one game, but ended with five the Crimson’s dominant 10-1 victory over Princeton.
While impressive, Dempsey’s five-goal performance wouldn’t be her most important against the Tigers. The ease with which she finds the net came in crucial in another late season home matchup against the Princeton. In the series-clinching win, Dempsey scored all of Harvard’s three regulation goals giving sophomore defender Marissa Gedman the opportunity to score game-winner in overtime and send the Crimson into the ECAC semifinals.
The Crimson, which earned the tournament’s two seed going 17-4-1 in conference play, has met the Saints in three of the last five postseasons. For the first time since Harvard’s 26-0-0 run, one of these teams will get another shot at the title bout.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In Ivy men’s basketball, nearly anything is possible.
For Harvard—this season’s overwhelming preseason favorite—conference play could have served as a coronation, a mere formality on the way to the Crimson’s first NCAA tournament appearance since 1946.
Instead, four teams now enter the final weekend of the season with a shot at the league championship, and for the second consecutive year, a one-game playoff could determine the Ivy League’s representative at March Madness.
The Crimson (24-4, 10-2 Ivy) sits in first place by half a game but is tied with Penn (17-11, 9-2) in the loss column. Either team can earn an outright title with wins coupled with at least one stumble by the other.
If both teams sweep this weekend and the Quakers emerge victorious on Tuesday at Princeton, then Harvard and Penn will share the title and would face each other in an additional game to determine who receives the league’s automatic bid to the NCAA tournament.
But third-place Yale (19-7, 9-3) and fourth-place Princeton (16-11, 7-4) remain mathematically alive, and depending on losses by Harvard and/or Penn, they could force a playoff involving three or four squads.
Things did not have to be so complicated. On the penultimate weekend of the year, the Crimson had the opportunity to secure at least a share of the second Ancient Eight title in school history by sweeping visiting Princeton and Penn.
Last Friday, it took care of the first step, taking down the Tigers, 67-64, at Lavietes Pavilion.
But Player of the Year frontrunner Zack Rosen and the Quakers stunned Harvard a day later, 55-54, keeping alive their own chances of returning the league crown to Philadelphia for the first time since 2007.
Harvard still controls its own destiny. A pair of road wins this weekend would mean that it, at worst, will end up in a playoff. Statistically the most likely scenario is the Crimson becoming the sole Ivy champion, and even if it were to lose in the additional game, it would certainly enter the discussion for an at-large bid.
Standing in the way of any of these fates Friday and Saturday will be Columbia and Cornell—each beatable squads, yet ones that gave Harvard quite a test at home back in early February.
First up will be the sixth-place Lions (14-14, 3-9), who will be backed by a sold-out Levien Gymnasium crowd expecting to see another close contest after Columbia lost by only five—the second-smallest margin of victory of the Crimson’s 10 league wins—in the teams’ previous matchup, during which the visitors trailed by just two points with two minutes left.
Having adjusted to the loss of star Noruwa Agho to injury earlier in the year, sixth-place Columbia is led by guard Brian Barbour, who totaled 21 points and eight assists at Yale last Friday, when the Lions mounted a comeback but ultimately fell short, 75-67.
A day later the Lions were upset by a hot-shooting Bears squad that went 14 of 22 from beyond the arc to blow out the road team, 94-78.
Ranking second in the league in Ivy scoring and first in assists, Barbour did have 18 points and 10 assists at Brown for his first career double-double and the highest assist total for a Columbia player in eight years.
“I’m concerned because they’re similar in ways to what Penn can do, which is to spread you out and dribble drive,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “The kid Barbour is very, very good off the bounce. Instead of trying to run their plays, [they might say], ‘Let’s just open the floor up and see if we can drive it by them.’ That’s what I anticipate they’ll look to do.”
But Columbia has struggled defensively as of late. The Lions sit at or near the bottom of the league in forcing turnovers and opponent field goal percentage, and their opponents shoot over 40 percent from beyond the arc.
Luckily for Columbia, Harvard sits in sixth in three-point percentage in league play after going 6 of 27 from three against Princeton and Penn.
The Lions’ travel partner Cornell (11-15, 6-6) will take the final scheduled crack at the Crimson after having fallen in Cambridge a month ago, 71-60.
This time around, the fifth-place Big Red will have the support of a sold-out Newman Arena, as well as the pressure of an ESPN3.com broadcast, to help its attempt to eclipse last season’s conference win total.
By all accounts a dangerous team—it carrying home wins over Princeton and Yale—Cornell took care of business at Brown with a six-point victory before being blown out at Yale on Saturday by 31.
The Bulldogs held Cornell to 18 percent shooting from three-point range, a debilitating mark considering that the Big Red rank among the top teams in the country in the proportion of its field goal attempts that are three-pointers.
The Crimson defense will have to contend with veteran guard Chris Wroblewski, who totaled 34 points, 15 rebounds, and seven assists at Brown and Yale.
“[Barbour and Wroblewski] are good players; they’re going to score; they’re going to hit tough shots. My sole job is to make it as tough as possible,” junior guard Brandyn Curry said. “After having to guard players like Rosen, it makes it a little bit easier to guard other guards.”
Former walk-on Johnathan Gray is the team’s second leading scorer in conference play and was the only Big Red player to reach double-figures in the game at Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a weekend when the new hottest show in town—men’s basketball—suffered a devastating defeat, old faithful delivered a pair of clutch victories to clinch home-ice and a bye week in the ECAC playoffs.
The men’s hockey team (10-8-11, 8-5-9 ECAC) wrapped up its first regular season with a winning record since 2007-08, concluding a tumultuous campaign with a third-place conference finish. The 3-2 victory over Clarkson (15-15-6, 9-9-4) and the 4-1 win against St. Lawrence (14-17-3, 10-11-1) propelled the Crimson into the upper third of the ECAC and gave an injured team a much needed bye week to heal up and get ready to compete.
Just as Zack Rosen and Penn were breaking Harvard hearts in Lavietes, junior David Valek was leading the Crimson to victory at Bright  Hockey Center. Down 2-1 entering the third period against the Knights, Harvard needed at least a tie to secure a top-four seed and a bye. Valek delivered that and more, scoring two goals in the final frame to give him four for the weekend. Before this weekend he had only scored two goals all season. For his efforts Valek was named Inside College Hockey’s national player of the week.
In order to keep this strange season going, the Crimson will need similar offensive outbursts from an attack that, despite leading the nation in power play efficiency, is in the middle of the pack in overall production in the ECAC.
The favorites entering the playoffs are certainly top-seed No. 7 Union (20-7-7, 14-4-4) and No. 13 Cornell (15-7-7, 12-4-6), but there is a marked drop off thereafter, making a semi-final or even finals appearance—both of which will take place in Atlantic City—a realistic possibility for Harvard.
The quarterfinal draws will be decided this weekend, but the Crimson holds a 7-3-6 record against its possible quarterfinal opponents.
Two of those losses, against Princeton and the Saints, occurred before the winter break—a stretch of play Harvard has traditionally struggled with under current head coach Ted Donato ’91.
In many ways the fate of this team will be decided by the decision-making of Donato. In the past he has made mistakes that I have criticized in these pages. At the same time, many of his moves that at first seemed doomed to failure—such as a switch in goal with just a few games left in the season and the abandoning of a structured offense on the power play—have yielded inspired results, with sophomore Raphael Girard recording a .951 save percentage over the weekend and the power play succeeding like no other in Crimson history.
On a team that has demonstrated its high talent level—eight of the 28 players have been drafted by NHL teams—both the glory of victory and the blame of defeat will fall on the shoulders of the man at the helm.
Harvard boasts eight ECAC tournament championships in its history—the most recent coming in 2006—and 13 regular season championships. It’s a stretch to assume the Crimson can reach glory in the tournament this year (especially considering it’s a combined 0-2-2 against the Big Red and the Dutchmen), but you never know what to expect with this team. This is the same group of players who didn’t lose a conference game for more than a month before falling, 7-1, to rival Yale.
Though the conclusion to this season is certainly still in the balance, next year we might expect the Crimson to make some noise. Harvard is only losing two of its top offensive producers, and while leading scorer Alex Killorn and classmate Eric Kroshus are no slouches, Harvard has a talented core of young players who can be expected to improve and pick up the slack next season.
Junior defender Danny Biega will be leading a class that features bruiser Marshall Everson and speedster Alex Fallstrom.  A talented freshman class featuring Colin Blackwell, Patrick McNally and Tommy O’Regan will have a year of experience under its belt, and a new crop of rookies will be welcomed to Cambridge.
But I can guarantee that Donato and company aren’t thinking about next year, at least not yet. For now, their focus rests solely on next weekend’s quarterfinal showdown with a thus-far faceless opponent. There’s no way to accurately predict the future for the Crimson as this up-and-down season has proven. But when you’re conditioned to expect the unexpected, you know one thing for certain: we’ll be watching from the edge of our seats.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Before Wednesday night’s tipoff against the Cleveland Cavaliers, Knicks fans—and sports fans—around the world were curious to see how New York starting point guard Jeremy Lin ’10 would bounce back after a dismal 1-for-11 shooting performance against the Miami Heat before the All-Star Break. His shooting percentage proved to be only one of several issues for the second-year guard in his last game, as LeBron James and Co. highlighted Lin's propensity to lose the ball in high-pressure situations and forced him to commit eight turnovers on the night.
Well, for one night, Lin quieted the critics. The former Harvard standout delivered a balanced performance against Kyrie Irving and the Cavs, posting 19 points to go along with 13 assists and one turnover. The Knicks handily beat Cleveland, 120-103.
“Coming off the Miami game, the only thing I focused on was to make sure my approach was the same in terms of aggressiveness and to make sure I did a better job of taking care of the ball,” Lin said after the game.
The Harvard alum showed significant improvement in both aspects, but then again, he did it against the 13-21 Cavaliers. Nevertheless, the strong outing should restore some confidence in the young point guard, who recorded these solid numbers in only 33 minutes of play, helping the Knicks level their record at 18-18.
Backup Baron Davis fared well off the bench and dished out eight assists, proving that he is getting back into game form and capable of relieving Lin from having to play major minutes every night.
Cleveland’s Antawn Jamison had a game-high 23 points, and teammate Irving pitched in 22 points with seven assists. New York’s Carmelo Anthony scored a team-high 22 points, and Tyson Chandler contributed 13 points and grabbed 15 boards.
Though Lin played well, fellow former benchwarmer Steve Novak was critical in reversing a 12-point halftime deficit into a New York lead that ballooned as large as 20 points in the fourth quarter. Novak hit five threes in the second half en route to 17 points for the night. Madison Square Garden, which roars for Lin on a nightly basis, found a new darling in Novak, chanting “We Want Novak" in the fourth when the Cavs were making a small run to close the deficit.
Knicks coach Mike D’Antoni put Lin and a majority of the starters back in the game to keep Cleveland at bay, and in the final 1:30, Lin closed out his performance with two passes that led to dunks for his teammates, Amare Stoudemire and Iman Shumpert.
Fans certainly left MSG with their faiths restored in Linsanity. But as the NBA season keeps rolling, the challenges do not stop for the Knicks here: They face a stern test on Sunday when Lin makes his way back to Cambridge to face the Celtics at TD Garden.

Feb. 26 to March 3 marks National Eating Disorders Awareness Week. In honor of the week, Harvard students and fellow collaborators have organized events with simple, yet profound, aims: to share their personal stories, increase awareness of eating disorders, and enable those struggling with eating disorders to find outlets through affordable treatment and art.
"body of work" is a gallery of student artwork and additional pieces from visiting artist Judith Shaw. The exhibit, organized by Kristen L. Cronon '12 and Zuri A. Sullivan '12, will take place on Thursday from 8 p.m. - 10 p.m. in the SOCH gallery. It will feature a reception including talks from student artists and Shaw, whose work shares her experiences on her recovery from anorexia. The multimedia display will include art composed of unconventional materials such as corrugated cardboard and used eyeglasses, perched on wooden shipping crates instead of pedestals.
"There's a lot of dialogue about bodies and body image and sexuality circulating right now," Cronon said. She described the art in the show as depicting "messages related to the body and body vulnerability and recovery, recovery through creativity."
Another Harvard Square event recognizes National Eating Disorders Awareness Week, but focuses on raising awareness in another way—through froyo. On Saturday from 10 a.m. - 10 p.m., Pinkberry will donate 20 percent of all profits to Project HEAL, a non-profit co-founded by Kristina Saffran '14 that helps people with eating disorders afford treatment.

No need to actually watch the game—Dr. Ruth Westheimer has got it covered. The well-known sex therapist, now in her eighties, is decoding Jeremy Lin's recent accomplishments, and using his moves, and basketball in general, to give some pointers about sex.
Read on for a play by play:
On her twitter @AskDrRuth, Dr. Ruth suggested that Lin, beyond inspiring victory on the court, can inspire other things too, especially in bed. The "pick and roll" is a Lin-inspired position. Westheimer tweeted that "you do your own scoring while the Knicks are playing." Whether you go for two or three pointers is up to you.
Dr. Ruth also has a few words of advice for particularly speedy individuals. "Just remember there's no 24 second clock in your bedroom," Dr. Ruth tweeted, warning men of the dangers of "stopping and popping" too quickly.
While fond of giving her opinion on most of Lin's moves, she also leaves some things up to her readers. "Back door play?" she asked, adding, "You can figure that one out."
Her Linspiration is not limited to 140 characters. A few days ago, Dr. Ruth wrote a piece for the Daily Beast titled, "What Jeremy Lin, Basketball Teach Us About Sex".
In this, she offered these four pointers:
1. Warm-ups, whether induced by running around the court or foreplay, get the blood flowing and prevent break-up-causing dissatisfaction.
2. Active involvement of all partners is essential in order to "score repeatedly," as Dr. Ruth wrote.
3. Team spirit on the court means playing your best, and sometimes having sex, even when you don't feel like it.
4. Good communication is essential to keep balls from flying out into the audience.
"Sex, like basketball, is a team sport," Dr. Ruth wrote. "You have to learn to play together and if you do, you can score repeatedly." One sure way to get better at the game? Dr. Ruth would probably suggest practice, either with others or on your own.

1. Now you see it, now you don't. Ben & Jerry's has removed the fortune cookies from its limited-edition "Taste the Lin-Sanity" frozen yogurt flavor and replaced them with pieces of waffle cones. The chain released a statement, saying, "We offer a heartfelt apology if anyone was offended by our handmade Lin-Sanity flavor."
2. Jeremy Lin isn't the only Harvard grad to grace the NBA court. Joanna M. Zimmerman '10 is a cheerleader for the Washington Wizards. Zimmerman has said that she knew Lin as an undergrad and, on Feb. 8, the two crossed paths again at the Knicks-Wizards game.

So for all you law-minded kids out there, now there's a concrete number letting you know Harvard Law is #1. That is, if "Legally Blonde" didn't already have you convinced.

In this most recent ranking, HLS received a perfect score of 100 for its academic reputation, 93.8 percent for its employer reputation, and had an average of 35.4 citations per paper, resulting in a final score of 91.7.
The University of Oxford, the University of Cambridge, Yale University, and Stanford University rounded out the top five law programs.
