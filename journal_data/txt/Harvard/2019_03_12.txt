The new “Game of Thrones” trailer dropped on Tuesday — and, as expected, it broke the Internet. Fantasy-loving twenty-somethings screeched with joy in their basements. Thousands of devoted fans shook off the uneasy feeling one gets after realizing they are romantically and sexually rooting for two people who are aunt and nephew to get together. Innumerable one-off pieces dissecting each frame of the two-minute trailer popped up across the blogosphere.
But looming over this fervor is an obvious yet unspoken problem: Is anyone going to admit that they cannot see a single thing? Or did showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss initiate a global syndicate that brainwashed the masses into perceiving their failing computer screens as incandescent IMAX displays?
The new trailer is so dark that it is literally impossible to know what is going on, and anyone who says otherwise is flat-out lying. The only plausible explanation is that all information has been collectively gleaned from those cultural super-consumers on Buzzfeed and Reddit who pause on every frame and enhance the brightness before explaining its cryptic contents. “Game of Thrones” trailers have been consistently dark, but qualitatively speaking, this one reaches new levels of unviewable.
Take, for example, just the first 30 seconds. Is that Arya running in the tombs? No, it’s just Winterfell at night. No, there’s Tormund, maybe he’s pacing those quirky little tunnels inside the Wall. But is he indoors or is it nighttime? Ah, now some daylight. But is it early morning? Late dusk? Where is the sun?
Yes, I get it: Winter is Coming. Sunlight and humanity are being stamped out by the snowy fury of the White Walkers. Life in Westeros is solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short, or whatever. But seriously, there are other ways to indicate both metaphysical and meteorological impending doom than shooting an entire blockbuster series through the least dilated aperture ever witnessed by humankind. With a budget of over $90 million for the season, HBO couldn’t afford a few extra studio lights?
There are maybe three or four well-lit shots in the two-minute teaser. All of them involve dragons, Sansa Stark’s luminous face (what skincare voodoo are they on in the North?), or some combination of the two. Even in a drama awash with garish good/evil, dark/light symbolism, this editing is almost egregiously heavy-handed. Moral dichotomies can be conveyed in many variations of grayscale, not just third-grade shades of black and white. The simplicity of darkness as a signaling device for dramatic legitimacy is infuriating to the point of that it depreciates the show itself.
Plus, lots of Serious Dramas use gorgeous color to great effect. Vulture picked up on this unnecessary darkness of serious shows way back in 2016, citing “Breaking Bad” and “Mad Men” as dramas that actually plumbed the inky depths of the color wheel and still, magically, garnered critical acclaim.
But the epidemic of dimness has only worsened in the last few years, and “Game of Thrones” was always a major part of the problem. Based on this trailer, all hope is lost that the show has some brighter tricks up its sleeve in its final season.

In 2016, the Instagram food scene had taken off, with bloggers popping up right and left and racking up hundreds of thousands of followers. As these bloggers posted aesthetically pleasing shots of everything from avocado toast and donut ice cream sandwiches to galaxy cakes, the social media world grew obsessed with following and finding food trends. 2016 was an especially busy year for the social media food scene, and it saw the rise of everything from those Black Tap crazy milkshakes in New York City to the pillowy perfection of a Japanese cheesecake. While the list goes on and on, the following four 2016 food trends were the ones that grew fan bases so prominent that they’re ingrained in the 21st century food vocabulary.
4. Starbucks Pink Drink
You’ve heard about it. You’ve seen it. And you’ve probably tasted it. This pastel light pink drink from Starbucks took Instagram by storm, usurping the pumpkin spice latte from its reign as the basic eye-rolling drink to order. The pink drink is really just the Strawberry Açai Refresher with coconut milk instead of water, which produces the milky pink color of the drink. Haven’t seen it on the menu before? That’s because the drink is a secret menu item, which means you need to know about it beforehand and specifically ask the baristas for it. Who knew this innocent pink drink could be so mysterious?
3. Sweet Potato Toast
This food trend was a topic of controversy amongst Instagram users following health food bloggers, but nonetheless, two years later and bloggers are still posting about sweet potato toasts. To the health food bloggers out there: Isn’t toast bread? Nothing but carbs? No bread, no toast. Therefore, sweet potato toast? Pretty sure it’s just thinly sliced sweet potatoes with various spreads and toppings placed on top. Whatever the name is, this food trend was featured on every food blogger or nutritionists’ Instagram page, including fan favorites like @shutthekaleup and @rachaelsgoodeats.
2. Rolled Ice Cream
Rolled ice cream stores, from 10Below in New York City to Holy Roly in Los Angeles, opened all across the country starting in 2016, due to all of the attention the dessert was getting on social media. This unique form of ice cream came to the States from Thailand, where it still is one of the most popular street food items. This dessert went viral on Instagram as the unique look of the ice cream became an obsession amongst food bloggers and their followers.
1. Cauliflower
If you’ve never had Trader Joe’s cauliflower gnocchi from the frozen food section, you’re really missing out and need to stop by a store as soon as possible to get caught up on essential food happenings. 2016 marked the start of cauliflower as the base for dishes like pasta and pizza as restaurants and food bloggers figured out that the vegetable serves as a substitute for regular grains, making dishes healthier with less carbs in many cases. Parents especially love these cauliflower-based products as a way to sneak vegetables into their kids’ meals — and Millennials quickly caught on to this healthy alternative.

Five years after the release of his eponymous debut album, Hozier is back with his sophomore album, “Wasteland, Baby!” His self-titled album skyrocketed the artist’s career, sold out world tours, and earned him a grammy nomination for the hit single “Take Me To Church.” In “Wasteland, Baby!,” He blends his woodsy vocals with raw, instrumental tracks. He begins with the powerful single “Nina Cried Power,” which uses choral groups to add to the timbre of sound. Taking a new perspective on the intersection of folk, acoustic, and gospel, “Wasteland Baby!”is an evocative follow up to Hozier’s difficult-to-top debut.
“Nina Cried Power” is a fitting introduction to an album that seeks to build and improve on the Irish artist’s tried and true style. Hozier’s vocals emulate the feeling of being isolated from, then returning to society. The tracks on “Wasteland, Baby!” showcase a diverse array of musical elements. “Movement” features bells and an acapella-inspired sound, featuring hand claps and forgoing percussive instruments or a band until the climatic end. “To Make Noise (Sing)” confirms everything that Hozier’s first album led listeners to expect from him. His expansive musical knowledge compels him to juxtapose these themes on a bluesy album with dark tones . The number’s major chords make it stand out in its own right.
Like his debut, “Wasteland, Baby!” is grounded by societally relevant subjects and provocative lyrics. Rumored to be inspired by astrophysicist Katie Mack, “No Plan” explores the end of the universe. Hozier alludes to Mack herself in the lyrics: “Sit in and watch the sunlight fade / Honey, enjoy, it's gettin’ late / There's no plan, there's no hand on the rein / As Mack explained, there will be darkness again.” Circulating back to “Nina Cried Power," Hozier samples the vocals of renowned artists Nina Simone, Joni Mitchell, Billie Holliday, James Brown, and Mavis Staples in order to credit “the legacy of protest.” When writing “Nina Cried Power” Hozier worked with singer and artists who worked and marched with the Civil Rights Movement and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. These cameos add depth and urgency to the earthy single.
Hozier ends the album with the titular track “Wasteland, Baby!,” the most moving, raw, and emotional song of the album. Similar in style to his song “Like Real People Do,” “Wasteland, Baby!” is underscored by acoustic guitar and soft vocals that complement the song’s personal touch. With lyrics that compare the cycle of a love affair to an apocalyptic encounter, “Wasteland, Baby!” embodies the feelings of peace and serenity that the album at large evokes. Hozier displays diverse songs tied together by their shared intersections of folk, acoustic, and gospel sounds accompanied by thought-provoking lyrics. While “Wasteland, Baby!” may not be a huge departure from Hozier’s existing repertoire, it doesn’t need to be. It stays true to his style without sacrificing exploration, all the while cementing Hozier’s place in a genre all his own.

It is so early in the morning that the time doesn’t even matter. I’m in the bottom bunk, my sister is above me. Braver than I am, she has taken the top bunk, much closer to our crooked ceiling fan. I’m afraid that it will slice my head in two when I’m asleep, but I’m also afraid that it will slice her head in two when she is asleep. On most nights, I turn the fan off once she has gone to bed. Our father comes through the doorway and switches on the light, and ever since then, I will associate flying with the confusion of a harsh yellow light breaking my sleep. He wakes me without ceremony; he is worried we will miss our flight. As I sit in bed, still under the covers, my mother hands me the clothes I am to wear. I change and fall asleep again. Our father comes back through the door and tells me to repeat after him: “Namo arihantanam, namo siddhanam, namo aryanam, namo upadhyanam, nama loe sabba sahunam.” I repeat after him, too tired to giggle at these unfamiliar words. He tells me that this is a prayer we say before we fly so that we will be safe. On the car ride to the airport, I repeat the words incessantly — the words I can remember, at least — so that we may always be safe, one long prayer for all the journeys we will ever take.
As a child, my parents taught me many things: some magical (don’t make faces; if the winds change direction, your face will get stuck that way), some important (call your grandparents). But my family has never been religious. I was never asked to memorize prayers or to place my faith in rituals. At home, our religion was nothing more than my grandfather’s nightly retellings of the Ramayana, whispered into our ears. Our trips to temples, few and far between, felt like visiting distant relatives — people I had only vaguely heard of and never really known.
It is so early in the morning that the time doesn’t even matter. I’m in a car, sitting beside my father, driving to my great-grandmother’s funeral. My brother is too young to have come with us; my sister can’t afford to miss school. I’m either on the bank of a river, or in a big field, with a hand on a flaming stick that is held by my father and his father; we are setting the pyre alight. All around me, my family is weeping: loud, gasping sobs that will stay with me much longer than the hazy memories of my great-grandmother. As the sun rises, so does the sound of weeping.
Today, there is nothing more I can recall from that day other than the sinking feeling that, one day, it will be someone else on that pyre — a sibling, a parent, an uncle, a friend. Since that morning, at some age so young the age doesn’t even matter, I have only recited prayers in times of uncertainty: at uneasiness before flying, or a loud pop in the gulley behind my house. I have come to associate religion with a hopeless fear, a sinking desire to shrink everyone I love and keep them safe in my pocket. And, with time — with moving countries and a growing understanding that death is as likely as life — praying has become akin to sweeping bulging masses of anxiety under the rug, a futile rebellion against nature’s impenetrable logic.
Can faith be more than struggling to keep things from dying? Maybe, there is nothing in the world that we can separate from death. Maybe, faith is a crutch. Maybe, though, on more hopeful days, faith can be struggling to keep things alive — to offer our lives as incantations: memories that we craft into stories and breathe into the air, that we repeat to everyone in our proximity until they find new life in the present. This faith is a tradition of art — of the reproduction of lost things — that has existed for millennia, and extends beyond protesting everyday fears of life, to the political.
Edwidge Danticat, a Haitian author, writes of a quiet revolution under dictator François Duvalier’s watchful eye in 1960s Haiti. Then, dissenting citizens performed Greek classics, rewritten for Haiti’s political climate, hidden in living rooms and church basements. These small revolutions came when “not reading or writing was a survival mechanism” and honored those that had fallen to a totalitarian regime, reproducing their legacies in the consciousness of generations to come. Creating “memorial art,” as Danticat puts it, can be an act of protesting the suddenness with which things die — an act of faith that keeps things alive.
On hopeful days, faith in art-making is the religion I call my own; on others, religion is an open-ended question, known only through the fear of losing.
— Contributing writer Yash Kumbhat’s column, “Portrait of a Time” is a personal essay column that discusses representation of home and identity in art through narratives from a Kolkatan perspective.

We are in the wake of one of the year’s most-anticipated holidays, and we’ve got you covered with a special Arts Playlist. That’s right, this Sunday marked the beginning of another popular edition of the long-standing institution of “Daylight Savings Time” (DST). Here are five songs to help you adjust to losing an hour of sleep.
“This Time Tomorrow” by The Kinks
This classic off the 1970 album “Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One” dares to ask the always-relevant question of how the whole DST system works in the first place. As lead vocalist Ray Davies sings in the chorus, “This time tomorrow where will we be / This time tomorrow what will we see,” alluding to the confusion of having to switch your clocks before your phone could do it for you. Indeed, the whole concept of wondering about “this time tomorrow” the night before DST adds a whole new layer to the song. That, combined with verses about feeling out of time on a long flight, makes “This Time Tomorrow” the perfect song to listen to before time itself changes before your very eyes. The Kinks will leave you wondering whether this time tomorrow will be an hour earlier than usual, an hour later than normal, or the same time as yesterday, dooming us to a life of repetition.
“Time” by Hans Zimmer
Ever watch “Inception” and think, “Gosh, this would be a whole lot better without the acting!” Well, composer Hans Zimmer’s “Time” is the song for you. Yes, the backing track to about 30 percent of YouTube’s motivational videos fits perfectly with the theme of losing an hour of sleep. With its emotional crescendos and deafening acoustics, “Time” encapsulates the spirit of “Inception,” that Leonardo DiCaprio and Marion Cotillard are in your dreams to remind you to switch your clocks. In the end, when the realization that the clock will skip from 1:59 a.m. to 3:00 a.m. keeps you up late Saturday night, why not listen to this song on repeat for a few hours?
“Daylight Saving” by Seal
This song comes off of Seal’s ninth studio album, “7.” You may be thinking to yourself, maybe the album is seven tracks long? It’s 11. Maybe it was released on July 7? Try Nov. 6. At least it peaked at #7 in the Dutch charts, saving Seal from having to quickly explain that the album title is “7” because it’s his seventh album of original songs, and that nobody should read into it any further. With lines like “Because it’s been so dark so long / I can’t tell what’s going on” and “Daylight save me all my head like I’ve had enough,” Seal meditates on the ever-elusive logic behind trying to reclaim lost time. Sadly, it appears that Seal used the clickbaity-title “Daylight Saving” to turn a serious government action into a silly pun. Save us, Seal, from another one of your dastardly tricks.
“It’s Time” by Imagine Dragons
The first of Imagine Dragons’ hits also has the most connections to Daylight Savings Time. The deepest points to the misconceptions around the origin of switching clocks. Many readers may have learned that Benjamin Franklin proposed saving daylight in order to help farmers get the most out of their days, but farmers actually lobbied heavily against the idea in the first place. The Dragons point to this nuance in the pre-chorus, singing, “‘I don’t ever want to leaven this town / Cause after all / This city never sleeps at night.” Instead of blindly supporting the government’s ability to legislate time, the group instead argues that if the city-folk will be awake anyway, the needs of the farmers must come first. However, Imagine Dragons eventually succumbs to the perseverance of Daylight Savings Time in the chorus. “It’s time to begin, isn’t it?” Yes, Dan Reynolds, muse of the agricultural industry, it’s time.
“The Times They Are a-Changin’” by Bob Dylan
Bob Dylan’s classic serves as both a reminder that the times are literally changing and a call to arms to fight the clock switch. The former is made clear by the title: Time as you know it now will soon be different because the clocks will move forward by an hour. The latter, though, deserves a deeper dive. Although Dylan wrote “The Times” as a protest song, in this context, it applies solely to those fighting Daylight Savings Time. Dylan specifically aims the song toward these fanatics in the first verse, writing, “If your time to you is worth saving / Then you better start swimmin’ or you’ll sink like a stone / For the times they are a-changin’.” From there, the rest of the song delves into the inter-generational dynamics at play within the Daylight Savings/Standard Time dispute. Speaking to the “mother and fathers throughout the land,” Dylan proposes they not “criticize what you can’t understand” because “Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,” and will not simply stand by while humanity attempts to play God with time. The ideological camps have gathered, “The line it is drawn,” and “the order is rapidly fading,” all because “the times they are a-changin’.” While the country was able to avoid conflict in the 1960s, in today’s fractured political climate, Dylan’s diatribe against Daylight Savings Time is still worth listening to.

“Infinite Football” opens on typically bleak Romanian scenery: a grey ice-skating rink with no one on it, separated from the rest of the grassless and treeless landscape by a chain-link fence. Though it’s not immediately clear, the viewer is watching Corneliu Porumboiu, the film’s director, in conversation with Laurentiu Ginghina, the subject of the documentary, as Ginghina explains the origins of his ambition to revolutionize soccer. Much of the film is structured as a conversation between the two men, and this technique works well in exploring Ginghina’s obsession with changing the rules of soccer. At times, however, it limits what could be a more emotionally incisive documentary. After all, it’s set in post-communist Romania, a setting that makes Ginghina’s story more poignant given the similarities between his journey to reform soccer and the country’s journey to leave a 40-year regime in the past — a connection that could have made the film fuller and more electrifying to watch.
During the summer of 1986, Ginghina was playing soccer with friends when someone, aiming for the ball, kicked him in the shin instead. The fracture didn’t heal properly, ending his soccer career before it began and dashing his hopes of entering a forestry university. Both activities required running, something he could no longer do. The injury came back to plague him in adulthood: His tibia broke when he was miles away from home, leaving him with no choice but to limp the entire journey. The rest of the documentary chronicles his attempts to change the rules of soccer, including his ideas to remove the corners of the field to streamline the area of play, to restrict players’ motion in order to emphasize passing and reduce the chance of collisions, and to do away with offside — a penalty called when a player is closer to his or her opponent’s goal line than both the ball and the second-last opponent — altogether. Many are skeptical of his new ideas.
Porumboiu has chosen a simple and effective structure for the film, orienting the camera towards himself and Ginghina, or placing Ginghina squarely in the middle of the frame as he answers questions. Throughout the 70 minute film, the setting changes only a few times — shuffling between a skating rink, an industrial factory, Ginghina’s office, a gym, and the home of an old photographer. Though the focus of the film is not on the setting itself, but rather on Ginghina, the diversity of settings helps orient the viewer in Ginghina’s world and plays a large role in contextualizing Ginghina’s trajectory and in setting a fittingly somber tone for the film as a whole.
One of the most tragicomic scenes of the film takes place in Ginghina’s office, where he makes phone calls on a woman’s behalf, who, after the Romanian Revolution against the Communist Party in 1989, never saw the land she once owned rightfully returned to her from the government. The man accompanying her repeatedly thanks Ginghina for helping her, expressing his gratitude that he even let them into his office in the first place. To an American viewer acquainted with relatively effective and efficient civic institutions, this scene seems absurd: Processing forms and papers is his job. However, in Romania, where bureaucracy is needlessly complicated and bribery-dependent, citizens have come to expect that legal government help will take months, years, or never even arrive.
Porumboiu brings a unique insight to the documentary in drawing visual parallels between Ginghina’s ambitions and the future of Romanian modernization. Ginghina’s hope to make the game he loved so much as a child safer for the players who have the opportunity to do what he never could, seems to mirror Romania’s many attempts to move beyond forty-odd stifling years of Communism. Ginghina himself alludes to this tortured progress: In 1999, he says, Romania was accepted into the European Union, and things got better — until progress slowed to a crawl. Romanian citizens are used to bureaucrats trying things out, only for their ideas to hit a roadblock or cause new problems entirely. Against this backdrop of failed political ventures, watching others, including Porumboiu, express their skepticism that Ginghina can ever reform the game is painful, yet riveting. “Infinite Football” is thus a portrait of a man wrestling not only with the problem of his lifetime, but with a country struggling to move forward into the 21st century.
Ginghina’s and Romania’s difficulties are evident in the last scene, which is perhaps the most impactful of all. The film shot opens to a road lined with dilapidated and crumbling houses, presumably a few minutes before dawn, and the scene is predominantly colored a slate-tinged blue. The camera moves slowly, as if to mimic Ginghina’s limp, which he discussed in the beginning of the film. Ginghina explains the phasing out of violent language in the Bible, and, by analogy, hopes to steadily change the “violent” rules of soccer: “Football as utopia,” Porumboiu says. That’s what Ginghina seems to idealize for the future of the game. By the end, however, the viewer is no closer to knowing whether he will succeed, nor if the desolate Romanian landscape will ever change, but the blueness of the final scene will leave anyone hoping, rightly, that one of those two things might come true.

With Christmas already forgotten but Boston’s never-ending winter still looming, it seems like our music playlists are stuck somewhere between holiday carols and spring break bangers. Tropical house music and upbeat pop tracks remind us of summer days far ahead, leaving us grumbling and bitter as we trudge through slush on the way to 9 a.m. classes. We rarely stop to appreciate the winter weather around us, and what better way to change our mood than with music? Whether it’s during your walk to class, a mid-afternoon nap, or a study sesh in a library, listening to these songs will have you fully embracing the winter beauty around you.
“Sweater Weather” by The Neighborhood
Although it might invoke more feelings of fall than spring, this slightly dark indie track is perfect for brooding winter nights. And the lyrics “It’s too cold” are too relatable not to sing out loud.
“Plans” by Elephante (Ft.. Brandyn Burnette)
A steady feel-good song, this track will make you want to grab your best friends and run around campus making snow-angels and pelting each other with snowballs.
“Fire” by Anna Of the North
Dreaming of a fire to warm up beside? This song’s cheerful beat and smooth lyrics will warm you up. It simply makes you excited about life. Grab some friends, snuggle up in some blankets, and just listen.
“Me 2” by Lakey Inspired (Ft. Julian Avila)
With a slow yet catchy instrumental beat, this track leaves you in a daze. Take a stroll through the winter wonderland that is the Yard post-snowfall while listening to this song for just the right touch of magic.
“Sleepy Eyes” by Elohim and Whethan
Winter making you sleepy, so you’re yearning for your bed? With a hopeful electronic beat and soothing lyrics, this track is the perfect way to start your winter mornings with a burst of happiness.
“Falling for U” by Peachy! and mxmtoon
This sappy-sweet song about developing a crush on someone is just too relatable, and will have you feeling all cozy in no time. Bonus points if you listen to it snuggled up in your bed watching the snow fall.
“Winter” by Khalid
This song is the perfect balance of melancholy lyrics and catchy beat, and blasting it through your AirPods first thing in the morning will give you an energy in your step to get through any weather forecast Cambridge throws your way.
“Let It Go” By James Bay
For some reason, this song always makes me think of winter. It’s incredibly sad and puts you in a deep reflective mood, perfect for long winter afternoons.
“Spring Day” by BTS
While the lyrics are in Korean, this song’s beauty transcends language barriers, even for American listeners. It leaves you feeling emotional and sad in just the right way, with that glimmer of hope at the end that spring is on its way.
Listen to the playlist here.

The music video for Ariana Grande’s “break up with your girlfriend, i'm bored” from her new album “thank u, next” certainly complements the catchy, sassy tone of the song. The video flashes between Ariana Grande on a porch with a beautiful cityscape behind her at sunset and a full party set at a luxurious home with tall staircases and large glass windows, where each person is just an ambiguous body except for the three main subjects: Ariana, the sought-after boy, and his girlfriend.
The entire video appears to be focused on this one pretty boy. To compliment the lyrics “Ain’t used to feelin’ this way (Mmmm-mmm) I do not know what to say (Yeah Yeah),” Ariana presents longing looks as she broods over the fact that he is already taken. Contrastingly, the chorus of “Break up with your girlfriend (Girlfriend), yeah yeah, ‘cause I’m bored” removes the gravity of emotion from her lyrics, and makes it seem as though perhaps her longing looks are interchangeable with sighs of boredom.
Ariana goes about trying to “steal” this boy away from his girlfriend by seemingly paying more attention to the girlfriend than the boy. Despite the lyrics, “You could say I’m hatin’ if you want to, But I only hate on her ‘cause I want you,” the video displays numerous shots of Ariana and this boy’s girlfriend dancing together, hugging, and clips of both girls provocatively touching each other’s hair. The two women also have eerily similar features: their eyes, hair, and bone structure. On multiple occasions, it is almost difficult to tell them apart. Perhaps this is a nod to the interchangeability of the two women in the eyes of the pursued boy, or the fact that Ariana can easily imagine herself in the position of this other woman. The attention Ariana gives the girl rather than the boy seems like an interesting choice of narrative, perhaps foreshadowing what is to come.
Between the various shots of Ariana at sunset and scenes of her dancing together with the boy and his girlfriend, the video starts to become slightly repetitive. The steady pulse of the song makes the video feel predictable and unsurprising: a song about a somewhat bored celeb looking to spice up her life with the addition of a sexy, taken, love interest. The end of the video, however, brings a massive plot twist. Ariana rejoins the boy and his girlfriend in a swimming pool. She leans in, as if to finally make a definite move on him, then instead is pulled away by the girlfriend and the two women lean in to kiss one another. Though the video cuts off before any definite answers are given, it is pretty easy to imagine the following scene.
This surprising ending causes a questioning in the meaning of the entire song. Is Ariana asking this boy to break up with his girlfriend because she wants him or because she wants her? Is she actually referring to the girlfriend when she sings, “Then I realize she’s right there / and I’m at home like ‘Damn this ain’t fair?’” One must also wonder if Ariana is trying to make her audience question the implied sexuality of her song with this video, or if she is merely trying to emphasize the reality of her boredom — that she does not truly care about the specific boy or his girlfriend, she just wants to create more drama. Regardless, the plot twist saves the entire music video. The video ends with a bang. Despite being otherwise predictable and somewhat ordinary, the end leads to numerous conversations of confusion, excitement, and interest.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Karl Lagerfeld has been dressing for a funeral for 40 years. The German fashion designer headed Chanel, Fendi, and his own eponymous brand. But he is perhaps best known for his sepulchral look: black coats, white gloves, dark glasses, and soaring gothic collars.
On Feb. 19, Lagerfeld passed away at the age of 85. The designer’s death left behind a huge and complicated legacy — one that includes both groundbreaking art and shocking allegations of fatphobia, Islamophobia, racism, and sexism.
Lagerfeld became a fixture of the fashion world when he became the art director of Chanel in 1983. A decade prior, Coco Chanel had died, and Lagerfeld’s brand had fallen into a genteel disrepair. Many considered the aging fashion house close to death. The Wertheimer family, which owns Chanel, gave Lagerfeld a “carte-blanche” to reinvent the brand. Lagerfeld revolutionized Chanel’s ready-to-wear line, turning it into a luxury brand that could be sold in malls and outlets. Lagerfeld also redesigned the fashion house’s branding, adapting Coco Chanel’s personal seal into the brand’s iconic crossed-Cs logo.
But the rebirth of Chanel was not Lagerfeld’s only professional accomplishment. The designer also served as creative director of Fendi, a role in which he controversially expanded the brand’s fur line. He founded and grew his own eponymous brand, which he described as “intellectual sexy.” In his later years, he started a bookstore — 7L — and turned his red point Birman cat — Choupette — into an Instagram celebrity with more than 300,000 followers. Lagerfeld once said that he would marry Choupette, if it was legal; and some suspect the cat may be an heiress to the designer’s multi-million dollar fortune.
Lagerfeld’s international fame seemed to come out of nowhere. One day he was an obscure womenswear designer from Hamburg; the next he was leading Chanel and Fendi. Questions about his past rarely made it past his implacable dark glasses. Lagerfeld often effaced and mythologized his early years. At various times, he stated his birth year as 1933 and 1938; later, he said he was born in neither of those years. He sometimes claimed to be the child of “Elisabeth of Germany” and “Otto Ludwig Lagerfelt of Sweden.” Evidence from a birth announcement in the Hamburger Nachtricthen newspaper indicates he was born in 1933 to a middle-class family of milk importers and small-time politicians.
And Lagerfeld’s misrepresentations of his past pale in comparison to his other controversies. In 1994, Lagerfeld used a verse from the Qur’an in Chanel’s spring collection, prompting a boycott from the Indonesian Muslim Scholars council. In 2009, the designer supported his colleague Wolfgang Joop, who implied that Victoria’s Secret model Heidi Klum was too heavy for high fashion. But perhaps the most insidious of Lagerfeld’s controversies is his use of fur. In 2009, the designer called criticism of fur “childish” and was sharply rebuked by animal rights activists.
Karl Lagerfeld’s career has been many things — groundbreaking, eye-catching, and controversial. But it has been nothing if not impactful. Whatever you think of him, Lagerfeld represented a distinct period in the history of fashion — an era of emaciated models and decadent furs and designers who seem only a title away from becoming medieval Counts. Perhaps this era should die with Lagerfeld. But we should not forget the art it created or the constructive reforms it inspired in the fashion world.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Alfonso Cuarón’s Oscar-winning film “Roma” is a watershed moment for both the Mexican and international entertainment industry. Yalitza Aparicio’s rise to fame is a step toward the representation that Oaxacan people have been excluded from on the film screen, as she is the first indigenous woman to have been nominated for an Oscar. This is just one of the many firsts that she has accomplished: She was also one of the first indigenous women on Vogue Mexico’s cover. The entertainment industry will recognize her name for years to come because of her impact. Aparicio, a former educator in her town of Tlaxiaco, Oaxaca, did not even aspire to become an actress, yet the work she has done is nothing short of momentous for the indigenous people of Mexico.
Mexican society has a long history of dealing with colorism that is rooted in its colonial history. In the 1700s, Spain established an elaborate caste system in order to categorize the population and assert dominance and white supremacy in the New World. They assigned indigenous people to the bottom of the social ladder, with those having mixed blood or mestizo blood relegated somewhere in the middle. Hundreds of years later, the ramifications of this caste system still affect the indigenous people of Mexico. Spanish literacy rates are low among indigenous people, making it difficult for them to vote for their own representatives. There is de facto discrimination against indigenous people in Mexico, which is more apparent in the entertainment industry, where there is a lack of diversity in the skin tones and ethnic backgrounds of the celebrities and light-skinned people dominate magazine pages.
This is why Yalitza Aparicio is creating such a stir. There has been major backlash against Aparicio’s newfound fame: Celebrities in Mexico have been critical of her talent and her merit for the Oscar, one even going so far as to use an anti-indigenous racial slur. Despite the negativity that Aparicio has faced within Mexico’s own entertainment industry, Latina Americans are unifying behind Aparicio in support of the representation she is working toward, from a professor raving about the emotional impact Aparicio has made on her students to immigration activists raving about the welcome representation Aparicio brings to darker-skinned Latinas. They recognize the harmful stereotypes borne of anti-indigenous sentiment that have been passed down through generations.
Yalitza represents two important successes for both women and the indigenous people of Mexico. Many in Mexican society fail to recognize the extent of the domestic duties that fall upon the woman of the household, who also struggle with cultural expectations to be passive homemakers. Cleo, the domestic worker that Aparicio plays in “Roma,” is a beautiful portrayal of the overlooked feminine strength that “machismo,” an entrenched and historical ideal of proud masculinity, undermines. “Roma” recognizes the silent struggles of indigenous women who are domestic workers and forge connections with their employers’ families, but are never truly a part of them. Change is slow but underway; currently, there is a Congressional bill being proposed called the National Domestic Workers Bill of Rights Act, which caused Cuarón to make a public service announcement in support of basic job protections for domestic workers.
In a more general sense, films like “Roma” and stars like Yalitza Aparicio urge us to recognize those who work closely with us but often go unappreciated. No one does so more poignantly and subtly than Cuarón does in “Roma.” One scene depicts Cleo snuggled up with the kids whose parents she works for, giving the audience a sense of the intimacy that domestic workers develop with the families they work for. However, before she can settle in, Cleo, reminded of her place, must quickly respond to a request for tea.

Even as temperatures dropped and snow blanketed Harvard’s grounds, students, alumni, and Boston locals made the trek to the Barker Center to listen to Harvard professor Sarah E. Lewis and renowned photographer Tyler Mitchell speak about the intersection between visual arts and justice.
On March 3, co-chairs of the Black Arts Festival (BAF), Antonia L. Scott ’20 and Gabrielle S. Preston ’20 introduced Lewis and Mitchell, the first speakers in the weeklong series of events that made up the 2019 Black Arts Festival. For Scott and Preston, Mitchell — the 24-year-old photographer who made history as the first African American to shoot Beyoncé for the cover of Vogue — and Lewis — an esteemed scholar of race, contemporary art, and culture — provided insight into the ideas race and imagery.
According to Scott, Tyler and Lewis’s participation underscored a larger ideology that went beyond the opening event.
“BAF 2019 seeks to celebrate the artists, activists, and organizers that inspire us to see ourselves more clearly, imagine radical alternatives, and change our possibilities for the future, and Tyler Mitchell and Professor Lewis fit that description amazingly well,” Scott wrote in an email.
Throughout the night, Lewis and Mitchell traded off between discussions of the photography industry and the representation of race in fashion. Mitchell came prepared: He set up a minimalistic slideshow consisting of photographs that impacted him, and then of his own work. Lewis matched his efforts, offering analyses and commentaries on many of his photographs.
Kayla U. Evans ’19 said that she appreciated the speakers’ synergy. “I was really excited to get the chance to hear about his motivations, and also hear Sarah Lewis’s interpretation of everything that he does,” she said. “Him showing us a piece of art, sharing what he thought of it, and then hearing Sarah come back and give all of her rich history, and her ideas, and the angle she saw was really impressive.”
At one point, Lewis mentioned Mitchell’s frequent use of double portraits. Mitchell explained that the aspect of twinning allowed him to expand on his ideas of the human state and double consciousness.
“I like to oscillate within that scale of freedom and repression,” Mitchell said.
Mitchell also said that the conversation was eye-opening for both him and his audience. Leaning back in his seat, Mitchell smiled. “You almost, in a way, have picked up more about my work than I have,” he said. The crowd chuckled in response.
After the event, Lewis said that she appreciated the new “lens” that Mitchell brought to the ideas of representation and justice. “What his work allows us to understand is that we can inaugurate a new mode of seeing, in particular, African-American figures through the lens,” she said. “So I see Tyler Mitchell’s work as central to my understanding of representational justice.”
A Q&A session followed immediately after the talk, where audience members asked Mitchell how he maintained his sense of self and dealt with the challenges of being black in the fashion industry.
“You have to realize that… you’re just being firm in your beliefs so, for me that was first, not getting too misty-eyed at any opportunities that were coming my way, and being clear-sighted on what my values were, and holding onto those,” Mitchell said.
Preston wrote in an email that both the night’s speakers and its audience underscored the importance of the talk.
“The conversation that I heard, and the bright focus that I felt from the audience, which lasted as the talk stretched past its scheduled end time and even after, as the building closed for the night, tells me that people are hungry for events like this,” Preston wrote.

On March 5, “From the Mind’s Eye” — a black filmmakers screening offered by Kuumba’s Black Arts Festival — brought experimental films and community discourse to the Leverett Library Theater.
The evening started with screenings of experimental films by students and black filmmakers, followed by a community discussion on the work presented. The films included “Office Hours,” a comedic look at the life of a teaching fellow by Jasi Lampkin, and Frances Bodomo’s “Boneshaker,” which chronicled an African family lost in America traveling to a Louisiana church.
Kuumba aims to improve whatever spaces it enters with new and diverse voices, according to its website— and BAF co-chairs Antonia L. Scott ’20 and Gabrielle S. Preston ’20 said that “From the Mind’s Eye” is one way to give black artists a platform.
“We wanted to create a space where we can give models for how to envision the world, and change the way we see the world and ourselves through the medium of film,” Scott said.
Films that represent a diverse group of artists are important because, according to Scott, blackness itself is not monolithic. “I wanted to make sure we featured people of different genders and from different regions,” she said.
The 2019 Black Arts Festival is the 21st in Kuumba’s history, and some viewers said that they felt excited to attend the screening because of Kuumba’s legacy. “I love BAF,” Ruva Chigwedere ’21 said. “I didn’t want to miss out on this event. I wanted to support Kuumba because they are doing great work.”
Other audience members said that they were drawn to particular films at the event. “Boneshaker” caught the attention of Taylor D. Shirtliff-Hinds ’21. “Although I was confused by it, I was also very moved, and you could feel the silence in the room as everyone was taking it in,” she said. “I think it’s really powerful that films can have that effect on people, and cause them to sit and live in the moment even after the moment of experiencing the film has ended.”
When asked whether black artists had a duty to use their platforms to evoke social change, Preston said that black art shouldn’t be held to that standard — instead, it should be judged on its artistic merit.
“I’m firmly in the camp of: ‘Nothing I do is necessarily related to my blackness or unrelated to my blackness.’ That’s the most viable way to look at a lot of this work,” Preston said.
“Unless the artist has spoken to their goals for the work particularly, I tend to view everything with a critical lense,” Preston added. “Not only asking what this is doing politically or culturally, but appreciating the work for its full potential instead of boxing viewers into only seeing it from that one perspective.”

Chatter rose in anticipation for “Sing it, Sister!” — an open mic that was part of the Black Arts Festival (BAF) — to start. The event, located at the Queen’s Head Pub, was an opportunity for the Harvard community to come together to sing, speak, and rap about what was on their minds.
BAF co-chair Antonia L. Scott ’20 opened up the mic with an introduction to the evening. “Black women are marginalized in a particular way,” she said. “We are honoring the black femmes in our lives.”
Sign-ups for the mic occurred all night, and one at a time, students came on stage to share their work. Several students performed spoken word pieces, with topics ranging from feminism to the blossoming of the inner self.
One performance included two short spoken word poems about singleness and the various ways love can transcend traditional romantic labels. Another poem, a rendition of Adele’s “Someone like You,” provoked a standing ovation from the crowd. Each performer was met with loud applause from the audience.
Along with the Black Arts Festival, the Harvard Women’s Center co-sponsored “Sing it, Sister!”
“I am really excited to see all the amazing talent of black women and femmes and the Women’s Center mission of celebrating achievement and being intersectional,” Mirielle E. Wright ’21, an intern at the Harvard Women’s Center, said.
For some students, the open mic night was an opportunity to step on stage for the first time.
“It is my first time ever performing in front of everyone, and I am pretty excited and kind of nervous,” Peace N. Madubuonwu ’19 said.
Madubuonwu premiered an original rap that she had written, with subjects ranging from overcoming adversity to having confidence in one’s capabilities.
In addition to featuring undergraduate voices, the open mic also stretched beyond the College student body. Azmera Hammouri-Davis, a graduate student at the Divinity School, said that she “loves celebrating the Black Arts.”
Davis’s act included both spoken word from Audre Lorde’s “Sister Outsider” and a musical rendition of James Bay’s “Let It Go.”
“Poetry has been a part of my passion for several years,” she said.

On March 7, “Drag as a Black Imaginary Space” — the second-to-last installation of the 2019 Black Arts Festival — brought a discussion of queerness, race, and drag to the Phillips Brooks House.
The event was moderated by gender studies scholar Omise’eke Tinsley, a visiting professor from the University of Texas, Austin who taught a famed “Beyoncé Feminism, Rihanna Womanism” course last semester. The panel consisted of five drag queens of color from the greater Boston area: Civil Lie Zation (also known as Maiyan when not in drag), Nadya Plaything, Qya Cristál, Severity Stone, and Anya Nuttz. The event, organized by Black Arts Festival co-chairs Antonia L. Scott ’20 and Gabrielle S. Preston ’20, attracted approximately 30 people.
With Tinsley leading the discussions, the topics ranged from the nuances of the Boston drag community to race relations in drag, and from the destruction of queer spaces in Boston to the panelists’ most memorable performances. About halfway through the event, Tinsley opened up the discussion to questions from the audience. Students asked about the intersection of drag and “transness,” how drag functions as an outlet through which performers can “play with race,” and reactions received from family members.
Many of the audience’s questions focused on the balance between using performance to educate cisgender, straight, white audiences on queerness and race and maintaining agency over their art. The panelists responded with an even deeper look at gender identity, cultural appropriation, safe spaces, family, and self-acceptance.
When asked what she wanted people to take away from the discussion, Scott said that she hoped audience members would feel more conscious of how they reflected their various identities.
“Something that I’m glad that the panelists talked about was how it’s good to be conscious of the ways that you present yourself and how read yourself in multiple walks of life,” Scott said.
In addition to exploring themes of fashion and identity, panelists also examined the ways that gentrification has restricted Boston’s queer community and has led to a destruction of safe spaces for BGLTQ individuals.
“I heard a lot about the way that gentrification is pushing out queer performers — and if we don’t support queer performers, who will?” Tinsley said.
Preston mentioned feeling especially impressed by the performer’s “incredible resilience.”
“It’s so hard to even sometimes begin to talk about blackness and gender and transness and survival and resilience,” Preston said. “It’s so hard to be an artist when you have all that on your shoulders.”

In a 1982 interview, Audre Lorde described how black female writers derive the greatest insights from following their feelings rather than from accepting education imposed on them. “Our feelings are our most genuine paths to knowledge,” Lorde said. On March 6, poet Nabila Lovelace discussed and advocated this philosophy as part of “Black Writers Workshop x Winter Tangerine,” an hour-long workshop she led in Farkas Hall. The session also included a world-building exercise, reflections on the writing process, a reading of a Lucille Clifton poem, and a group of student writers gathered together to participate.
The collaboration between the Black Arts Festival and Winter Tangerine magazine, whose stated mission is to give voice to “traditionally uncentered communities,” arose from a feeling — specifically, Gabby S. Preston ’20’s emotional reaction to a Winter Tangerine workshop last summer. Preston felt “really moved” by the event, became determined to bring the organization into dialogue with Harvard students, and asked Winter Tangerine founder Yasmin Belkhyr on the spot for a collaboration. Preston, Scott, and Belkhyr brought Preston’s hope to fruition.
For one of the exercises Lovelace led, the pile of books — borrowed from Lamont Library’s Woodberry Poetry Room — provided words to be culled and reconfigured into fresh phrases. Another exercise centered around world building.
“There is nothing too small for the writing. There is nothing too small to make up a world of,” Lovelace said.
Zindzi L. Hammond-Hanson ’19, who attended the workshop, said that she appreciated Lovelace’s advice. “Hearing our guest, at the end, talk about taking a page out of Audre Lorde’s book — about starting from feelings versus ideas, and having the courage to let yourself be led by the most inner parts of you outwards through writing — that was great,” Hammond-Hanson said.
Preston hoped the workshop could open up paths for student writers in a way that Preston feels many spaces in Harvard do not.
“If you’re not on The Advocate, or if you’re not in these spaces that are institutionally telling you you’re an artist, it can be hard,” Preston said. “It can be hard to be here and write and and do that in ways that are artistically important to you without that sort of outside validation. I wanted to bring some validation, and some creative space, and some of the love that Winter Tangerine represents to me, to campus.”

It only takes a few pages for “Run Away” to inform the reader that the word “beige” is a little outdated: “The politically correct term is ‘earth tones.’” Such a detail appears incidental to the plot, but it’s exactly the kind of quip that regularly resurfaces throughout the latest novel from New York Times bestseller Harlan Coben. Unfortunately, sometimes these quips are grouped in lengthy paragraphs that seem like they’re trying too hard to be something they’re not. Coben repeatedly plays with the idea of inserting cultural critiques into a thriller — trying to make an otherwise decently plotted thriller into a work of affected prose — only to fail at both endeavors. The many digressions and awkward phrasing demand better editorial attention, both to bring attention back to plot and to minimize poorly phrased rhetorical devices.
Simon Greene — Wall Street bigshot, father of three, devoted husband to Ingrid, generic thriller protagonist — has been searching for his drug-addled eldest daughter Paige for a while now. What begins as an altercation between him and Paige’s equally drug-addicted boyfriend Aaron turns into a wild-goose chase starring him, his wife, and Elena Ramirez, a private investigator whose own search intersects with theirs when Aaron is found dead. Add in genetic testing, a weird cult reminiscent of “The Handmaid’s Tale,” and multiple chapters from the point of view of Ash and Dee Dee, two characters whose roles are only made clear toward the end of the novel, and you’ve got a thriller with enough moving parts to theoretically keep things interesting.
The issue is, however, that Coben could not seem to decide what exactly he wanted this novel to be. Should it be a tightly wound edge-of-your-seat thriller that wraps up all its loose ends? Or a work with prose so moving it will make you cry at its profundity? In playing with both ways of writing, Coben ends up writing neither novel, making it difficult to truly sink into the action or appreciate the moments of supposed “insight” that comes, strangely enough, not from Simon himself, but from the omniscient narrator who occasionally uses Simon as a mouthpiece for his own tangential opinions he feels must be inserted into the action.
One excerpt dives deep into the necessity of money: “Pooh-pooh it all you want. Money may not buy happiness, but...well, nonsense. Money, pretty much more than anything else you might be able to control, can conjure up and elevate that elusive ideal we call happiness.” This kind of phrase resurfaces many, many times throughout the novel, chopping up the action in disdain of continuity. Readers looking for a thriller paced at a fast clip should look elsewhere. To make such shifts even more jarring and out-of-place is Coben’s inability to decide which voice should tell the story. Third person? Second person? Many of these tangents address the reader in second person before transitioning back to the actual plot — which, thankfully, is told in third. By the end of the novel, it’s easy enough to ignore these inconsistencies, yet that’s precisely the problem: The reader shouldn’t have to — especially not in a thriller that purportedly relies on a fast pace to carry the story along.
Other “highlights” include philosophical reminiscence on the physical manifestation of a gun on one’s hip; contemplation of Death “battling Life” in Hollywood movies; and describing sex in the most generic way possible — “she missed the way he looked at her when he was inside her, as if she were the only woman on God’s green earth” — as though the reader has yet to discover these revelations. Coben also lists a dozen adjectives in a row in an attempt at profundity, and, particularly jarring to the millennial reader, incorrectly identifies a simple quote as “a meme.”
All of these details, seemingly dropped in with no apparent purpose or foresight, distract from the pacing of the novel. If anything, they are so clumsily executed that the reader is left wondering why they are there, other than the author’s desire to insert his own editorializing into the novel. It’s a shame that the attempts at what Coben perceives as “literariness” weren’t edited out: The reader might have been able to engage with the actual “mystery” part of the novel.
But of course, since the author’s attention was divided in two ways, the plot itself also leaves something to be desired. The end reveal is much more compressed than it should have been, and Simon, our main character, somehow figures out everything on his own at the perfect times. Paige’s reappearance is the ultimate deus ex machina, and the way Coben charts the passage of time is clumsy, like he didn’t know how to keep the story chugging along.
The failure of “Run Away” to deliver at the level of prose could, perhaps, be forgiven, depending on the demands of the reader. But the failure to construct a thriller that does not rely on seemingly random reveals is a great deal less excusable. Adding in a cult for the special effects is a nice touch, but haphazardly throwing together cults, drugs, and genetic testing does not make a thriller.

From March 3 to March 8, the Kuumba Singers' Black Arts Festival held events from panel talks to writing workshops to film screenings. The Festival, titled "Envision" in 2019, offered Harvard students a "celebration of creativity in the black community." Here's some of what the Festival included.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Acclaimed South Korean writer and director Park Chan-wook visited the Harvard Film Archives on March 5 for a conversation with Professors Carter Eckert and Alexander Zahlten of Harvard’s East Asian Languages and Civilizations Department.
Park’s visit coincides with a course taught by Eckert and Zahlten titled “Frames in Time: Korean Cinema as History and Filmmaking.” Two of Park’s films headline the syllabus and were shown at the Harvard Film Archives the weekend leading up to his visit. “Joint Security Area” (2000) is a mystery film that centers on a shooting in the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea, while “The Handmaiden” (2016) is a psychological thriller about how social concerns complicate a love affair in colonial Korea. Park’s filmography also includes “Oldboy,” his 2003 noir action film, and the science fiction picture “Snowpiercer,” among others. Park spoke in Korean throughout the conversation as a translator rendered his responses into English.
After Eckert and Zahlten began the conversation by projecting a montage of iconic scenes from Park’s filmography, Park revisited his early career and recalled his budding passion for film. Two films that resonated with him at a young age were “Vertigo" by American director Alfred Hitchcock and “Hwanyeo '82” (which translates into “Woman of Fire ’82”) by Korean director Ki-Young Kim. "Although I think these two films are very different, the common thread between the two films, to me, is those films have very surreal qualities about them. They depict those objects that are very familiar to us, but it taught me that depending on the perspective of the filmmaker you can present these as very unfamiliar,” Park said.
Jeehae Park, a fellow at Harvard Medical School, said she appreciated Park's use of humor to anchor his films’ emotional cores. “I really liked when he explained how he introduced humor and the effect of it,” she said. “I recognized those from his movies, but I didn’t know how he directed or what kind of effect he tried to make out of those, so it was cool to hear that.”
Park also remarked on the sociopolitical factors that shaped his signature filmmaking style. Growing up as part of the “386 Generation” — a generation of South Koreans born in the 1960s, who went to college in the 1980s, and played a tremendous role in the democratization of their country — Park recalled the protests in which he participated in college. “I came across a lot of teargas. Of course in those days, if you were a student, you took part,” he said. “It is imagining the impending violence that is the most scary. The violence in my films is more about fear of imminent violence.”
While the South Korean struggle for democratization molded part of Park's directorial identity, many of his recent films can be read as social commentaries on more modern issues. When asked how “The Handmaiden” dealt with same-sex romance, Park said, “It is a genre film so the point is not for audience members to say, ‘They're two women — they shouldn’t do that,’ but ‘This woman should swindle the other lady out of money!’” referring to the drastically different socioeconomic backgrounds of the lovers in the film. “It is a big budget film. There were people who were not without concern that we were spending that much money in same-sex romance,” he said. “I was prepared for backlash, but no — it was completely accepted by the public.”
Audience member Reverend G. Stewart Barns, Episcopal Chaplain emeritus and Consultant to Harvard University Health Services, said he was impressed by Park's sincerity. “I was so struck by his honesty, his integrity, his sense of history, his sense of current political movements. And of course in the Handmaiden, his handling of same sex marriages into the texture of his movies. He's really extraordinarily articulate,” he said.
Eckert and Zahlten asked Park about the importance of dealing with conventional narratives, to which he responded that he relished turning tropes on their head. “I take immense joy in misleading the audience, for the audience to find the narrative take a turn into something unexpected — to be surprised,” he said. The very premise of "The Handmaiden," Park explained, is conventional in South Korean cinema: A wealthy Japanese household in the colonial era hires a young Korean handmaiden. But the film quickly devolves into something different — the Handmaiden falls in love with the mistress of the Japanese household she's trying to defraud. Park's unexpected twists in the plot allowed him to explore same-sex relations in a unique light.
Audience member Jacob A. Heberle ’22, who has seen many of Park’s films, said he appreciates Park's particular filmmaking techniques. “He sticks to his own rules,” Heberle said. “He really makes the films the products that he wants, the story he wants to tell, and the message he wants to impart on his audience. For example, he finds a lot of unique ways to put in his own little touch, like adding in dark humor and subverting audience expectations. He likes to play around with film conventions and I think that’s a sign of a great filmmaker.”

Streaming giant Netflix likes to keep its 139 million subscribers happy by keeping its stockpile of movie selections fresh. Every month, a handful of TV shows and movies leave the streaming site, but this outflow is matched by an influx of new ones. Here are three particularly welcome additions — oldies but goodies — and two notable mentions coming to Netflix this month.
“Apollo 13” (March 1)
Ron Howard’s 1995 film is a thrilling tale of human survival in the vacuum of space. It captures the sequence of events leading up to the failure of the titular spaceflight mission to the moon. The story is told as a parallel between the ramping tensions in the cockpit as the astronauts address a stream of technical problems, and the pragmatic resilience of problem solvers at NASA Headquarters. The film also balances powerful performances from its central cast of astronauts, which includes Tom Hanks and Kevin Bacon. While its depictions of space may not be as awe-inspiring as films released in recent memory (no doubt in part due to technical limitations 20 years ago) — such as the expansive sense of infinity in Alfonso Cuarón’s “Gravity" and the haunting beauty of Damien Chazelle’s “First Man” come to mind — “Apollo 13” is still a poignant portrayal of resilience in the face of diminishing odds and is worth a watch.
“The Hurt Locker” (March 1)
“The Hurt Locker” is an exhilarating military thriller that tells the story of a battered U.S. soldier (Jeremy Renner) in Explosive Ordnance Disposal (the process of deeming explosive devices safe) who deals with the harsh realities of the Iraq War as well as the difficulties of adjusting to mundane civilian life. Many memorable moments transpire when the soldiers find themselves forced into action. Director Kathryn Bigelow handles tension in these scenarios impressively, with her visceral cinematography and shaky camera movements that immerse the viewer entirely in the hammering pace of the adrenaline-laced action. While not done to the scale of a full-blown war epic popularized by Spielberg’s “Saving Private Ryan,” “The Hurt Locker” more than holds its own merit with its smaller scale. The film is uncompromising in forcing the audience to confront completely immersive, brutal, and morbid images, but the violence is not simply gratuitous.
“Kung Fu Hustle” (March 15)
A hysterical comedy with a ridiculous plot that matches its ridiculous fun, Stephen Chow’s unique, Cantonese take on a gangster film is hard to forget. Chow also stars as the film’s lead, Sing, a down on his luck aspiring gangster, who, together with his helpless sidekick Bone (Lam Chi-Chung), traverses a bleak Shanghai in an attempt to find a neighborhood where they can belong as gangsters. Some plot points are convoluted and the premise is absurd, but the film is acutely self-aware. Featuring well-choreographed martial arts scenes (which Chow also plays for laughs), an iconic climax, and a guaranteed two hours of nonstop laughter, “Kung Fu Hustle” deserves a few rewatches.
Notable Mentions:
“Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon” (March 1)
Ang Lee enlivens his sprawling masterpiece with luscious cinematography, expertly crafted fight scenes, and powerhouse performances. The story follows a seasoned warrior Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat) as he leaves his highly coveted, legendary sword, the "Green Destiny,” with his lover Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh). Lee’s film mixes emotionally resonant storytelling with twists that will keep any audience engaged and sets that look like they were plucked out of time from the Qing Dynasty.
“Saving Mr. Banks” (March 1)
"Saving Mr. Banks" is a feel-good, if perhaps sensationalized, drama of Walt Disney convincing P.L. Travers to hand over the rights for "Mary Poppins." With a narrative that flips back and forth between Travers’ childhood and her present struggle with Disney, there are moments that feel uneven in its tone and pacing. But with bankable performances from its two stars, Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson, nostalgic music, and an unmistakably fantastical "Disney" atmosphere, “Saving Mr Banks” is hard not to enjoy.

The last rays of the setting sun filtered into the Art Wing of the Smith Campus Center on March 7, creating a natural spotlight for hip-hop artist J.I.D and his management team, Since the 80s. Invited by student group No Label, the critically acclaimed rapper and his managers, Barry Johnson and Zekiel Nicholson, spoke about their experiences breaking into the rap industry.
Since the 80s and J.I.D are the most recent in a string of artists and producers, including Travis Scott, that No Label (founded by Marcelo P. Hanta-Davis ’20 and Miles W. Weddle ’20) welcomed to campus this year. It is the self-described goal of Since the 80s to bridge the hip-hop sounds of the 80s with contemporary artists of today. Johnson and Nicholson highlighted their close relationships with artists such as 21 Savage and EarthGang and the importance of creating a vision that both they and their artists desire and can achieve.
Moderator Makeda V. Daniel ’19, a member of No Label, began by asking about the team’s motivations and creative process. J.I.D — sporting a camo jacket, Adidas joggers, and Yeezy sneakers — chimed in.
“I do something, and I don’t stop at it. I don’t sleep, I sit in my room for hours. When I get it right, then it’s over,” he said. The artist added that he is extremely passionate about music and obsessive in his work ethic.
J.I.D then compared the team’s creative process to sculpting: He starts with an idea and together he, Johnson, and Nicholson chip away at it until they find the right medium. The trio traded jokes and laughed, trying to find the right words to describe the “tug-of-war” aspect of their process. Johnson summarized their response.
“Our goal is to find something realistic,” he said.
An Atlanta native, J.I.D initially dreamed of playing for the NFL. He attended Hampton University on a football scholarship, but dropped out to pursue music at the encouragement of his friends. Asked about leaving football behind, J.I.D shrugged and attributed his confidence to enter the rap scene to his support system.
“They really just believed in me,” he said. “We wanted to be the biggest in the game. They had the same mindset as me, and we wanted to be successful.”
The trio’s journey came with obstacles. J.I.D and Since the 80s recalled the struggle of promoting the artist’s first album, “The Never Story.” For months, Johnson and Nicholson asked every artist and producer in the hip-hop industry to give J.I.D’s album a listen, but nobody cared.
“We have to go and do stuff. If you don’t do it for yourself, it don’t get done,” J.I.D said.
Johnson joked at the beginning of the panel that all three were psychopaths, and he circled back to the idea to underscore their dedication to their dreams. “The dream is crazy,” Johnson said. “All of us up here [in the panel] are probably the craziest people in this room.”
During the Q&A session, Johnson recounted one of their efforts to promote J.I.D. Seven people squeezed into a six-person Chevy, packed with all their luggage as they drove cross-country, opening concerts for free. The men slept on friends’ floors, eating ramen daily and struggling to keep moving forward. Even after two positively received albums, J.I.D and Since the 80s refused to claim success. “To say I’m successful now is to limit myself,” Nicholson said. “It’s more about being happy with what you’re doing.”
After the event, Daniel explained the purpose of No Label. “[We] wanted to create experiences for artists in the community and students who were just interested and passionate about conversations in music,” Daniel said. “[They are] able to be in the same room with artists that have already sort of ‘made it’ in this idea of success, whatever it may be.”
“I thought it was really good, I thought it was really insightful,” said Alexander E. Arlos, a Boston University student, about the event. “[My friend and I are] doing something very similar to what they’re talking about right now. We’re trying to make music, so getting his advice was really helpful to me and I got a lot from it.”
Hueston M. Brathwaite, a Boston resident and aspiring artist, also attended the event to learn and network. “Just being able to meet potential new artists that I could possibly work with later on, was amazing, and to see that I have so many things in common with homeboy, was really cool,” he said.

Boston Ballet’s new show “Full on Forsythe” showcases the most recent works of American choreographer and innovative genius William Forsythe. After a long career in Europe, Forsythe created a piece for Boston Ballet called “Playlist (EP),” the first work he has choreographed for a North American company in almost 30 years. The show, which runs March 7 through March 17, also includes last year’s experimental “Pas/Parts” and “Blake Works I.” Due to its magnificent group of dancers and sublime choreography, Boston Ballet’s “Full on Forsythe” is a triumphant delight that celebrates both Forsythe’s innovations and its performers’ intensive energy.
With its spectacular ’80s voguing-inspired movements, “Playlist (EP)” is easily the most exciting work on the program. It is no easy task to choreograph to both Barry White’s sultry and fun “Sha La La Means I Love You” and Lion Babe and Jax Jones’ club track “Impossible” and still call it classical ballet, but Forsythe has accomplished this feat. “Playlist (EP)” is marked by chasses, glissades, and fanning arms that merge into a endless array of swinging, conga-like hips. At times, the performance feels like a scene from “Paris is Burning.”
The ’80s influence brings a much needed and unexpected freshness to the art form. On some level, it instantiates a sense of humor because ballet stands in such contrast to the wild movements of disco. Yet it also demonstrates that there are unexpected similarities to be found between pop dancing and classical ballet. A number of chugging movements and flowing arms, for example, recall “Phlegmatic” from Balanchine’s “Four Temperaments.” And Kathleen Breen Combes’ tongue-in-cheek, Michael Jackson-like shift onto the tops of her toes is, in essence, a simple bend while balancing on the pointe shoes’ block.
Forsythe has always been known to push the boundaries of choreography with dances full of chaotic formations and movement, which eventually converge into recognizable motifs and ordered canons. “Pas/Parts,” as Boston Ballet demonstrates, is no exception. The work comprises a series of 20 quickly-paced divertissements including solos, duets, trios, quartets, and ensemble movements for 14 dancers. The steps are at their heart classical, but oddly-angled, inverted arms and turned-in knees speak to its contemporary influence. Dancers move fluidly between each style, such that at times it becomes difficult to differentiate between them, lending modernity and effortlessness to the work.
“Pas/Parts” is set to a maximalist, dissonant soundtrack, including reversed shrieks, mambo music, and even Mongolian throat singing, that ingrains a steady heartbeat in the work. Eventually, the once-jarring sounds become monotonous and appear to fade into the background, allowing the viewer to focus on the dancing. Of particular note is “11,” a syncopated duet between female dancers Ji Young Chae and Seo Hye Han, who dance with sensuousness and strength. “16,” led by the epic Misa Kuranaga and Patric Palkens, is also remarkable due to the partners’ intense interconnected movements, moving flawlessly as two parts of one whole.
The “Blake Works I” sequence, a delicate mix of classical and modern dance set to seven James Blake electronic songs, was also incredibly refreshing. The piece’s most stunning performances are set to the synth-heavy “Two Men Down” and the heartbreaking “The Colour in Anything.”
In “Two Men Down,” seven male dancers are eventually joined by all the women of the piece. In this fast-paced and footwork-heavy piece, rapid arm movements melt into slow extensions. What begins as chaos — male dancers stagger across the stage haphazardly, moving feverishly in offbeat fashion — quickly turns into a series of canons and then one final, synchronized mass of dancers performing an allegro. Derek Dunn’s dancing here is particularly fabulous, as he makes his splendid leaps and bouncing turns blend together into one movement. The dancers on the whole expertly handle the progression from chaos to order as they anchor the wild movements with phenomenal levels of control.
In “The Colour in Anything,” the wildly talented Chyrstyn Fentroy and Roddy Doble take on the role of lovers caught in some sort of miscommunication. Their movements are initially synchronized, but become separated in the form of a lag. Fentroy’s grace and Doble’s strong stage presence make the performance particularly convincing. Though there is no explicit story to this dance, their combined energy and longing looks seem to form one.
Overall, the nuanced performances and Forsythe’s tremendously innovative choreography form the heart of this fantastic show. With his perfectly fused hybridizations of ballet and ’80s culture, Forsythe has really outdone himself. One only hopes that this new choreography leads to many more new works.

Critic Hilton Als and novelist Claire Messud talked cultural monoliths, a Barbadian family heritage, and the gravity of the human condition at the Mahindra Humanities Center on March 4. Als’s speech revolved around the humanity that characterizes his work — from “Personal History” essays in the New Yorker to his Artist’s Institute one man show.
Claire Messud began the evening by enumerating Als’s many merits: his Pulitzer Prize for criticism after years at The New Yorker and the Village Voice, his books “The Women” and “White Girls,” and the art exhibit on James Baldwin he recently curated at David Zwirner in New York City.
“As Ezra Pound would have had it,” Messud said, “‘he makes it new.’”
Messud noted that Als will soon relinquish his position as theater critic to be a critic-at-large for the New Yorker, at which point Als chimed in from the audience to say that he won’t have to go out five nights a week anymore.
When Als took the stage, he first paid tribute to his inspirations among the audience: Jamaica Kincaid, to whom he wrote a fan letter after reading “Wingless” and later befriended, and Anna Kohler, an actress who features in one of Als’s first theater pieces.
After paying his respects, Als proceeded to read an excerpt from his novel on Richard Pryor. The novel examines a close relationship between Pryor and a reporter. Their lives are connected by parallels, and they share past ordeals and trauma. The themes set the premise for much of the rest of Messud and Als’s discussion.
After moving from the podium to the neighboring table to begin his conversation with Messud, Als continued to read the next couple of pages of the Pryor novel. Messud insisted that Als continue — Als was reluctant because, he said, he likes to leave the readers wanting less.
In his reading of the novel, Als addressed the difficulty of encapsulating reality and the truth of imagination at once in a form of writing. As for his latest novel, he said, “It’s made up and it’s not made up at the same time.” Pryor is anti-hip-hop, anti-Miles Davis, anti-Toni Morrison — Als wrote that Pryor has his own brand of radicalism. “How can you smash the black patriarchy when it is you, and there is so little of it in the world?” he read from the novel.
Als also spoke of love and of being the extramarital interest of someone married, akin to the reporter’s situation in the piece on Pryor. He explains that when you’re the third person, there is an element of heightened unreality that makes you more desirable — you’re not the one at home who forgot the Bounty. Being the third person also never satisfies — Als writes of the reporter’s insatiable yearning for something more of his relationship with Pryor, which, he later says to Messud, is something he has experienced.
On the other hand, now that Als is in love within a more conventional relationship, he said he doesn’t want to go out five nights a week (at least as a theater critic) anymore. He doesn’t have to go out into the world to see what the world is doing — it’s at home. “Did you get the toilet paper?” — Als said this frustration with a loved one is an endearing reality.
Als offered several insights into the experience of a writer, many of which he had alluded to in his reading. He said of his novel on Pryor that he “wanted to play a joke on nonfiction narrative” — why pretend that the writer is not there? The facts in journalism are always affected by the sensibilities of the journalist, Als remarked. He added that, as Tillie Olsen said, you can call your writing whatever you like — short fiction, a memoir, or a novel — but the labels are futile because regardless, you are writing about memory.
Those memories lay bare human realities, like as Als said, that nothing prevents people from yearning for love — even cruelty. He returned to an image he read aloud earlier where Pryor’s father punches him in the chest, and Pryor’s heart in his chest curls around his father’s fist. When learning about Pryor’s relationship with his father, Als realized that it mirrored the memory of his own father.
Als additionally spoke of the fortifying experience of reading about other people’s loneliness and finding within it your own.
Carissa Rodriguez, an artist in the audience and a visiting lecturer at Harvard, met Als in New York when she was 19. When asked what part of the talk resonated with her the most, Rodriguez cited Als’s generosity in sharing about himself and his experiences.
“He’s my deepest inspiration,” she said.
Student and former Crimson columnist Minahil A. Khan ’19 also said that she appreciated Als’s openness.
“It was so honest and genuine — the entire conversation,” Khan said. “It didn’t feel like there was an entire, not just room — more like stadium — full of people here. He would show his own confusion.”

The general public prefers when it can to think in teams. To keep an account of every person or idea is difficult, so as a matter of convenience it helps to put them into groups whose members all share certain traits: New Yorkers walk quickly, Republicans dislike the welfare state, scholastic theologians are highly technical. This is in no way an illegitimate impulse, for usually issues have sides on each of which the participants are agreed on a few basic points, vary though they may in the details.
The defining features of these teams can vary in specificity, as do the levels of the biological hierarchy from domain to species. What Southerners, for instance, have in common is much broader than what the West Coast Straussians have. In discerning what the teams in a given argument are, the trick is to cast a net of the correct size.
Now, analyzing the so-called culture wars is just such a task, and right understanding hinges on identifying what is in dispute and who are disputing it. One of the battles is about the purpose of higher education, whether it should solely train the mind how to think or whether it should also impart moral cultivation.
On the one side we can put English professor Harold Bloom of Yale, a literary critic who maintains that reading great literature is for attaining “cognitive power,” “rhetorical power,” and “a real capacity for apprehending otherness,” but not for refining one’s standards of ethical behavior. On the other side we might put, modestly, me, who thinks that a work such as “Hamlet” is meaningless if one fails to recognize that its moral tensions are also one’s own, not merely a set of premises the reader must accept temporarily in order to comprehend the play.
Bloom’s position is nonetheless thoughtful, and a controversy between his team and mine would be quite interesting because they are distinguished at this fairly specific level, since both agree that there exists in the first place such a thing as great literature, which we should read, in contradistinction to bad literature, which we should not. It would be impossible to debate the fruits of reading Shakespeare if one of the combatants did not understand why they were discussing Shakespeare and not, say, E. L. James.
But if you glance up from this proposed argument, you will find that the real world will not suffer it to take place. In the real world, Bloom and I are counted on the same team.
This cannot be, you say; this is manifestly absurd from the foregoing. I agree with you. Many thousands of people, however, do not agree with you, and these are the members of the other team, which stages a dispute at a broader level. They do not care about Bloom and my disagreement about the value of great literature, for they object to the very idea of “great literature,” which they find to be a self-serving figment of the patriarchy.
Bloom, calling people so persuaded the School of Resentment, gets called a conservative and is placed on my roster for disbelieving that aesthetic merit is a bourgeois preoccupation. A vast spectrum of literary opinion which should be arguing within itself becomes compressed into an undifferentiated line because the campus left, perennially bereft of good taste, tries to make up for this defect by denying that good taste exists. This is, one can imagine, a depressing state of affairs, not only because arguing with the School of Resentment is exceedingly boring but because it obscures my disagreement with Bloom, which is both more interesting and more important.
The problem recurs in every area of intellectual life. Jordan B. Peterson, a swashbuckling Gnostic who in a better world would be a conservative’s sworn enemy, is classed with me as an upholder of patriarcho-fascism. Psychology professor Steven Pinker, atheist libertarian, argues that test scores should determine admission to Harvard, and that puts him on my side, notwithstanding meritocracy’s history as a dirty word in conservative circles. The most glaring disagreements are crowded out; the thinking cannot debate each other because we are indiscriminately besieged by the unthinking, the unthinkable, the thoughtless, the thankless.
I didn’t pick these teams. I hate these teams. A civilization in which I rose every morning to do battle with Bloom would at least be fun, but there’s no chance of having one until the campus barbarians are domesticated.

Last month, Nicholas Zuckerman, the Arizona man who threatened to bomb Harvard’s first-ever black Commencement in 2017, pleaded guilty to charges related to the threats, and now faces 12-18 months in prison.
While online threats sometimes go unexamined, we believe that the decisive action of law enforcement in this case constitutes a valuable expression of institutional support for students of color and reaffirms our commitment to a safe community. Zuckerman’s threat against black Commencement only underscores the need for this and other events on Harvard’s campus that are designed to celebrate communities of students from marginalized backgrounds who face challenges both on their paths to Harvard and their journeys through it.
Originally organized by black students across Harvard’s graduate schools, black Commencement brings together black students from all parts of the University to celebrate their accomplishments, acknowledge the challenges faced by students of color on a historically white-dominated campus, and foster a sense of support and belonging. To that end, we believe identity-focused academic celebrations such as Black Convocation, Lavender Graduation, and Latinx Convocation play a vital role in reinforcing our continuous striving toward making Harvard a place where people from all backgrounds feel welcomed, valued, and safe.
The threats from Zuckerman indisputably engender terror among those targeted. We must not shy away from labelling this threat for what it is: an act of terror. Threats like these can bring out others who have similar toxic beliefs, and risk normalizing racist views. Zuckerman may not have executed his threats, but the very nature of a threat gives it destructive power nevertheless.
Zuckerman’s guilty plea offers a chance to reflect on the environment the University fosters for students from marginalized groups. We believe that while such threats take place, the University must offer greater support for cultural resources and affinity groups so that minority students feel more safe and included. Complaints that culturally-focused events constitute forms of reverse racism fuel violent ideologies like Zuckerman’s, and those who make them only discredit the specific challenges faced by marginalized communities in doing so. This mindset must not prevail. The Harvard community must be sensitive to the unique challenges faced by minority groups and work diligently to create a home for those communities within its campus.
That increased institutional support should extend to events like black Commencement as well. Black Commencement has been organized by graduate students, and Black Convocation is organized by the Black Students Association, but the University should play a more active role in these events by supporting the organizational efforts of these groups. They may possibly do this by assuming liability for risks of potential threats from the events’ student organizers. More institutional support must not mean that the University should take a paternalistic approach to the design of these events, and we hope that the administration will find ways to help facilitate these events without inhibiting the ability of student organizers to create events that they feel are authentically their own.
We also extend our gratitude to the Harvard University Police Department and federal authorities for addressing Zuckerman’s threats, so that the 2017 black Commencement proceeded as a beautiful and meaningful event for people of color in the Harvard community. We hope that this event and others like it become established as new Harvard traditions for many years to come.

The Committee on Student Life, a secretive body that lacks even a web page, is considering seizing control of the admissions process for extracurricular groups. This proposal has the support of Undergraduate Council President Sruthi Palaniappan ’20. Comping did not even appear on Palaniappan’s 31-point platform, but the administration has been toying with overseeing the College’s “comp” process for some time. As far back as 2017, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana’s sanctions Implementation Committee suggested that “the practices and culture of comping should be examined … [by the] Committee on Student Life.” Last summer, Khurana appointed Kate Colleran to oversee “policy implementation, assessment, and engagement culture” for student organizations.
Students have every principled and practical reason to oppose this administrative power grab. Harvard claims that its mission is to “educate the citizens and citizen-leaders for our society.” But the administration often treats students like children. Our student body includes the U.S. Youth Poet Laureate and entrepreneurs bringing the fight against cancer to the poorest countries in the world. But still, we are denied opportunities if our deans do not approve of our social groups. We must secure tutor permission to have friends over on a Friday night. This proposed policy of evaluating comps takes Harvard’s paternalism to a new and dangerous level. In the name of inclusivity, UC Vice President Julia M. Huesa ’20 said the College may reserve the right to determine whether each comp process is “adding value or contributing to the experience or the educational mission of the College.”
Let us be clear about what that means. The Committee of Student Life and not the debate team would determine how to select debaters. The Committee of Student Life and not theater groups would have the final say on what constitutes an appropriate audition. The Committee of Student Life and not literary magazines would decide the way to pick good writers. All 500-plus student groups would potentially subject every detail of their comp to scrutiny by an unaccountable committee. I need hardly elaborate on the message that sends about Harvard’s trust in its students.
I carry no water for arbitrary exclusivity. I am a member of zero organizations on campus. I was cut by the Fly Club and have been rejected by almost every extracurricular to which I applied. But we should honestly face the practical consequences of this attempt to foster inclusion by fiat. The Crimson Key Society, famous for its social comp, could cease to exist immediately. These groups may not be missed. But other groups — groups which enrich thousands of student experiences — may soon follow. The Asian American Brotherhood, which has an intense and selective comp, builds community among mostly Asian-American men. The Harvard College Consulting Group has a notably low acceptance rate as it selects members it can depend on while working with real-world clients. Eleganza selects attractive models after a competitive audition, while bringing the diverse student body together and raising thousands for charity. Under the proposed audit policy, these groups may disappear in their current form. If the impacts on student life prove devastating, perhaps Khurana will again suggest we read Chaucer.
If Palaniappan and Huesa want to fight exclusivity, they should clean their own stables first. The UC chooses its members by vote — the ultimate popularity contest. Two-thirds of first-years who ran for the UC last fall were not elected and were therefore excluded from any participation in student government. With elections just weeks into the year, first-years with experience running for office had an “unfair” advantage. Ending the UC’s exclusivity would be easy: Replace it with a Student Assembly, allowing any undergraduate to attend its sessions and vote. Abolish the presidency and pick a communal, rotating executive by lottery. Doing so would give many more people the chance to lead the student body, regardless of arbitrary social status. By advocating these changes, Palaniappan and Huesa would make a powerful statement against exclusivity. But if they are unwilling to accept more inclusive standards themselves, they should not ask administrators to impose those standards on others.
In his installation address, University President Lawrence S. Bacow bravely said that “we must strive to model the behavior we would hope to see elsewhere.” He also said that we “scour the world for students… prepared to demonstrate brilliance… [on] performance stages, and out in the community.” Surely, it is not modelling pluralism and tolerance to condescendingly micromanage student groups trying to demonstrate brilliance on performing stages and in the community. Surely, when he goes home to Michigan, Bacow does not want to have to explain to the people of Pontiac why Harvard students cannot be trusted to run theater auditions on their own. Surely, when we welcome German Chancellor Angela Merkel to speak to our common values at Commencement, Bacow should be able to look her in the eye and tell her than we are upholding those values in Harvard Yard.
The University recently launched the Inclusion and Belonging Pulse Survey, telling us that “your experience matters.” If Bacow truly believes that our experience matters, he will stop University Hall from meddling with extracurriculars, the heart of undergraduate student life.

The Economics Department is working to create more entry-level courses focused on the applications — as opposed to theory — of economics in an effort to attract more freshmen and sophomores, according to Department Chair Jeremy C. Stein.
The department currently has one main introductory course that is a prerequisite to upper-level courses — Economics 10: “Principles of Economics.” Ec10 focuses very heavily on theory, which may discourage some students from taking the class or pursuing economics more broadly, Stein said. To combat this issue, the department has already created one application-heavy introductory course — Professor Raj Chetty’s Economics 1152: “Using Big Data to Solve Economic and Social Problems” — and hopes to introduce more like it.
Both Stein and Economics Director of Undergraduate Studies Jeffrey A. Miron said some students have not found Ec10’s theory-first approach particularly interesting.
“To some students, ec10 (and 1010a, 1010b, 1123) are the ‘spinach’ while electives and applications are the ‘dessert.’ So it’s reasonable to allow the option of getting a taste of dessert first,” Miron wrote in an email.
Freshmen interested in issues beyond economic theory, like income inequality or health care, have a harder time getting a flavor of such topics early on in their college career because they must start with Ec10 before taking other electives, according to Stein. The smaller range of course options early on may turn some people off from the field, he added.
“For juniors and seniors, we have a wide variety of offerings — lots of topics and many terrific faculty. But for freshmen and sophomores the pipe is narrower,” Stein said. “And so maybe they conclude, 'this is not for me, this is for people who want to be business majors.'”
Chetty’s course, targeted at freshmen and sophomores, aims to address this issue by showing the applications of “big data” and how it can be used to understand and solve current pressing socioeconomic issues.
“Raj wanted to be able to teach his course to freshmen and sophomores and so we did two things,” Stein said. “First off, there is no prerequisite for his course. And second — and this is new — even though there is no prerequisite, the course still counts towards the major. The goal in both cases being to increase accessibility.”
Alexandra Norris ’21, a student in Chetty’s course, said she finds “Big Data” particularly appealing because of its focus on policy. She added that it has “enhanced” her interest in economics.
“I enjoy how Chetty presents issues in class by first examining the issue, then looking for causation, and finally using the findings to devise programs or interventions that may improve people’s lives,” she said. “This course focuses on solutions to issues, allowing me to think about how what I learn can be applied to help people.”
Stein said the curriculum change that Chetty’s course is spearheading “may have broader implications” for future courses.
“We will be considering additional courses that imitate Chetty’s in not imposing an Ec10 requirement,” Miron said.
Though the department is not currently making structural changes to existing courses, freshman seminars taught by Economics professors can also count as electives towards the concentration, according to Miron.

In an effort to make safe sex practices more widespread across campus, Sexual Health Awareness and Relationship Communication Educators are piloting a “SHARC Kit” program through which College students can receive supplies like condoms anonymously.
The program — which is currently underway in Currier and Leverett Houses — allows students to fill out a Google form and request to receive a kit through the College mailing system, according to SHARC Co-Director Brandi Moore ’19. The group eventually plans to expand the program.
“It allows students who don't feel comfortable necessarily going in a dining hall to pick up safer sex supplies — or going into one of the offices on campus to get that — to kind of just have a really discrete way to have safer sex supplies with a fair amount of ease,” Moore said. “So that's something awesome and we hope to roll it out to other houses because it's been very, very popular, which is really exciting.”
SHARC will also continue to provide safe sex supplies for students during their office hours in dining halls on campus. Currently, students can see SHARC counselors from 9-10:30 p.m. in Currier Dining Hall on Sundays, Kirkland House Dining Hall on Mondays, Leverett House Dining Hall on Tuesdays, and Quincy House Dining Hall on Thursdays.
Before becoming a peer educator group in 2017, SHARC was a peer-counseling organization. The organization changed its status following the results of a sexual health survey released in 2016. The group shifted its focus to “actually engage in more active outreach” and have the ability to set up events with students, according to Moore.
Moore said the group wants students to know that SHARC does more than hand out safe sex supplies, though. She said that while the organization is currently viewed as the “condom group” on campus, organization members want to change that perception.
“We also want them to know that we also focus on relationships, and kind of relationship education, how to properly communicate your needs, wants, and non-negotiables, things like that,” Moore said.
Since 2014, SHARC has offered its workshop “Sexual Health 101” to student groups across campus. The workshop focuses on using different types of sex supplies, getting sexually transmitted infections testing on campus, and asking for consent, according to Moore.
“This is basically a workshop that covers the basics of sexual education, because we recognize, especially at Harvard where a lot of people are coming either internationally or out of state, we don't have the same sex ed backgrounds,” Brandi said. “There are some people who had abstinence-only education if they had any at all, and there are other people who probably got a really comprehensive sexual education prior to coming to college.”

A maroon BMW struck the front of The Harvard Crimson building at 14 Plympton St. on Monday evening, damaging the entrance. The driver sustained minor injuries, and no one else was injured.
The car was driven by Jonah Naghi, who said he was in Cambridge to host an event at Harvard Hillel. Naghi did not recall the name of the event when asked after the fact. He said he was driving his mother’s vehicle at the time of the crash, which he had borrowed to get to work.
Naghi said he was originally parallel parked on the other side of Plympton Street, but after seeing that he was on the edge of the white line, he “wanted to get a little closer in.” While turning his car to adjust, he said he accidentally drove the vehicle into the front door of The Crimson.
“I mean, it all happened so fast, but I believe after I felt I was going a little too fast, I switched my foot to the brake, but then it just kept going,” Naghi said. “The brake wasn’t working, and then I bumped into the door.”
Sihak Lee ’20-’21, who witnessed the accident, said he had been helping Naghi guide his car into the parking spot and that Naghi was correcting his position when the crash occurred.
“I was standing next to him, and I told him that he needed to pull his car out to the car in front of him, so that his wheels are parallel,” Lee said. “And when he was trying to do that, he approached the front car really quickly, halted for a second, and then resumed to swerve into the building.”
“It was kind of like a movie scene just happening in front of my eyes,” Lee added. “I did try to coach him, but that part I didn't tell him to do.”
Naghi said he did not intentionally drive the car into the building.
“I wasn’t under the influence,” he said. “It was just an accident.”
“I don’t drive that often, as you can probably tell,” Naghi added.
Harvard Crimson President Kristine E. Guillaume ’20 was at the building at the time of the incident and spoke with the driver and police officers on the scene.
“I am grateful that everyone is safe and no Crimson editors or passersby were harmed in the incident this evening,” Guillaume wrote in an emailed statement. “We are handling the situation accordingly.”
Both Harvard University Police Department and Cambridge Police Department responded to the accident. HUPD declined to comment on the incident, referring to the Cambridge Police Department for comment.
CPD also declined to comment, referring to HUPD for comment.

The Athletics Department and Harvard University Health Services' Counseling and Mental Health Services have collaborated to launch a program for student athletes that primarily focuses on mental health screening, education, and care through workshops for students and coaches.
The new initiative, dubbed the "Crimson Mind and Body Performance Program," debuted at the beginning of last semester in response to survey data collected over the previous few athletic seasons. The program provides mental health services specifically tailored to College students on varsity sports teams.
Two licensed clinical social workers spend half of their time working with student-athletes and coaches through the program, according to Brant Berkstresser, the associate director of athletics for student-athlete health and performance. Their main responsibilities include meeting with student athletes individually and holding workshops for them, as well as coaches.
In the past, some student-athletes turned to their coaches for support, but the new system promises to streamline resources and give athletes easier access to mental health professionals, according to Women's Soccer Head Coach Chris Hamblin.
“The coaches aren't licensed clinicians...we deal with a lot of different situations and then trying to support us to athletes as best we can,” he said. “We don't have the tool kit to be able to really be able to navigate some of these challenging struggles that students face.”
Some students said they think the program is necessary because of the stigma that some athletes face in seeking mental health support.
“There’s a lot of access available but I think there’s a lot of negative stigma surrounding mental health and I think it’s kind of looked upon as a weakness,” Meghan C. Tveit ’20, a women’s soccer player, said.
Darryl Lemus, one of the licensed clinical social workers who works with the new program, said he thinks some athletes might not feel comfortable admitting that they need mental health counseling.
“I think a persona about image that most people have of what a student athlete is like this tough, thick-skinned person and nothing really bothers them,” he said.
Plans to launch the Crimson Mind and Body program started in the spring of 2018, when members of the Student Athlete Advisory Council raised the idea with Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise during meeting, according to council co-president Claire C. Rushin ’19.
Berkstresser, who collaborated with council members to shape the program’s logistics during summer 2018, said a series of surveys given to student-athletes in the years before 2018 had made clear that it would be helpful to increase athlete-specific mental health programming.
The student workshops offered through the program are discussion-based, and student-athletes help choose their programming, according to College spokesperson Aaron M. Goldman wrote. Recent topics have included concerns about eating and nutrition, according to Lemus and Melissa Nauman, another licensed clinical social worker who staffs the program.
Though most of their time is spent with students, Nauman and Lemus said they believe their interactions with coaches are valuable too.
“The coaches and the trainers have...played huge roles in helping to connect the student athletes to services, which I think is really like a special thing that's come from this,” Nauman said.
The social workers and some athletes and coaches said that, while the program is still evolving, it has increased conversation about student-athletes’ mental health and educated coaches about how to support their players.
“Communication and education has been great and we just didn't have that before,” Jennifer Weiss, head coach of the women’s volleyball team, said.
One of the most helpful elements of the program is the meetings that Nauman and Lemus held with each team at the beginning of the school year, Rushin said.
“That was one way that it became a resource that everyone knew,” she said.
Though the program has made progress, there is still more work to be done because some athletes still do not feel comfortable asking for support, Rushin said.
“Until we can start to break down the barriers that keeps getting athletes from seeking out help, we haven't done our job,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A questionnaire sent to college and university presidents around the country in January showed that only four in 10 surveyed are confident Harvard will win its current admissions lawsuit, according to findings published Friday.
Inside Higher Ed conducted the annual survey with analytics group Gallup. The results aggregated the opinions of 784 college and university presidents on topics ranging from the admissions suit and affirmative action to Title IX regulations.
The admissions lawsuit, brought by anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions, alleges that Harvard admissions policies unfairly discriminate against Asian-American applicants. Harvard has rejected these allegations and has argued its race-conscious admissions policies are necessary to achieve diversity in its student body. The outcome of the suit — which could be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court — may shape the fate of affirmative action at private colleges and universities nationwide.
Only 37 percent of surveyed presidents said they strongly agree or agree that they are “confident in Harvard’s defense of itself and the principles of affirmative action.” Sixty-two percent, however, agreed that colleges and universities should continue to account for race in their admissions processes. A majority of those surveyed — 57 percent — disagreed with a statement asking whether their institution is planning for a possible end to affirmative action.
Slightly over half also said private colleges like Harvard should continue to consider legacy status — whether an applicant has a family member who is an alumnus — when deciding whether to admit applicants.
Over the course of the admissions lawsuit trial, documents submitted as evidence made public previously unknown parts of Harvard’s secretive admissions process, including details about Harvard’s treatment of donors’ children and the contents of a handbook used to train incoming admissions officers. Despite the newly revealed information, surveyed presidents overwhelmingly thought the college admissions process remains opaque to most people.
Nearly eight in 10 believe “the public does not understand the concept of holistic admissions, by which applications are considered individually rather than deciding on admissions primarily based on a scale of grades and test scores.”
College spokesperson Rachael Dane supported Harvard’s trial arguments in an emailed statement, writing that the College’s admissions process is not discriminatory.
“Harvard College is committed to expanding opportunity, to excellence, and to creating the diverse community essential to fulfilling its mission of educating engaged citizens and leaders. Harvard’s admissions policies do not discriminate against any applicant from any group,” Dane wrote.
The survey also asked the presidents about a series of other topics related to higher education. Nearly half of those surveyed said they disagreed with recently released Department of Education guidelines seeking to reshape Title IX procedures at colleges and universities. Title IX is a federal law that prohibits sex-based discrimination at universities that receive federal funding, like Harvard.
A slightly higher number of respondents this year believed that “perceptions of colleges as intolerant of conservative political views are accurate,” rising from 32 percent in 2018 to 37 percent in 2019. At the same time, the number of respondents who indicated that they had concerns about Republican lawmakers' “increasing skepticism about higher education” dropped by 11 percentage points.
In January, Gallup invited 3,667 presidents to take the survey. The 784 that did so represented 436 public institutions, 320 private institutions, and 28 for-profit institutions.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an email that University President Lawrence S. Bacow did not take the survey.

Incoming and current faculty members at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences are now required to report their involvement in promoting diversity and inclusion, which could then affect the assignment of faculty bonuses, Dean of SEAS Francis J. Doyle III said in a February interview.
Administrators implemented the requirement this academic year in accordance with a number of other diversity initiatives. Prospective faculty members must now provide a “diversity, inclusion, and belonging statement” as a part of their application, according to Doyle.
“I have found this to be a very important thing that we want to use in our recruiting to, again, set the tone that we value this — we think it’s a priority,” Doyle said.
SEAS has also implemented a requirement that current faculty members report any efforts they are undertaking to promote diversity, inclusion, and belonging. Such efforts could range from modifying course curricula to mentoring student affinity groups. Doyle said that while he does factor other aspects of faculty members’ job performance when assigning bonuses, he considers this information a “priority” in his decision.
“This is the way, in the University setting, that I can indicate the importance of this and reward accordingly when our faculty are invested deeply in that area,” Doyle said.
The diversity statement is one of a number of new initiatives created in the wake of an April 2018 climate survey that found more than a quarter of respondents have experienced harassment or discrimination at some point during their time at SEAS. Alexis J. Stokes, director of diversity, inclusion, and belonging at SEAS, said that requiring incoming and current faculty to report their commitment to diversity serves as a consistent means of monitoring their involvement in fostering an inclusive environment.
“It’s on both ends — as you’re entering the community, and then once you are part of the community, we’re still asking you to report on the things you’re doing,” Stokes said.
Though other divisions within the Faculty of Arts and Sciences do not currently require a diversity statement, the school is currently looking to learn from SEAS’s example, according to FAS Dean Claudine Gay.
“In addition to SEAS, I know of a couple of other universities that are moving in similar directions,” Gay said. “From the perspective of the FAS, we’re looking at these experiments in the hopes of learning from them and seeing what makes sense for the FAS in terms of our own hiring practices.”
“Certainly one of the many things that we hope the faculty who come here do is find ways to advance inclusion and belonging, because as we know, that is one of the priorities for the FAS and for the University more generally,” Gay added.
Like Doyle, Gay said a number of considerations are taken into account when assigning faculty bonuses at the end of the year, and efforts to promote diversity and inclusion can intersect with each of those considerations.
“When we think about bonuses or acknowledging or rewarding faculty who have had an exceptional year, we look at the full complement of expectations we have for faculty,” Gay said. “Throughout, frankly, all those domains, we think about questions around how this person contributes to our institutional commitment to advance equity, inclusion, and belonging.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Crimson’s early-season success has been the outcome of intense preparation and high team chemistry, something rare for a squad where a third of the members are first-years. However, Harvard’s strong freshman class was able to quickly adjust to college play, bonding with the rest of their teammates and stepping up in crucial games.
First-year goaltender Zoe Banks has consistently shown impressive performances since the first weekend of play. Banks, a Palo Alto, CA. native, comes from the same high school as the Crimson’s senior keeper and co-captain, Sam Acker. Faced with the challenge of stepping up against difficult opponents in her first season, Banks was able to hold her own and contribute to Harvard’s historic 9-0 start to the 2019 campaign.
Banks’ impressive start for the Crimson, however, took a mutual effort, as each member of the squad contributed to the chemistry of the team and the enthusiasm surrounding the start of the season.
Choosing the Right Fit
As a high school athlete, Banks was a member of the USA national youth team as well as the captain of her high school’s water polo squad, leading them to four consecutive league championships.
The college recruitment process is a strenuous time for any athlete, and choosing the right program to commit to is an always an extremely difficult decision. This stress was no different for Banks, who committed to Harvard in her second semester of senior year.
“My process lasted a bit longer,” said Banks, who acknowledged that most other commits make their decisions by the start of senior year. “But I think I knew the whole time that I really wanted to come here because this wasn’t like any other Division I club.”
The combination of a highly-competitive water polo program and an institution that offered Banks both an excellent education and the freedom to study whatever she wanted drove her to Harvard over the other schools that she was deciding between.
Adjusting to a New Level of Play
Making the jump from high school, Banks had to adapt to the faster pace of the game and the athleticism of the competition quickly.
“My coaches have been great in helping me improve my technique a lot in order for me to be better prepared for those shots,” Banks said.
Immediately, Banks showed that her preparation had paid off. In the first weekend of competition, she recorded seven saves and an assist, helping the Crimson start their regular season out strong. Banks also played a big part in the Crimson’s first shutout in program history, recording five saves against LaSalle in a 17-0 victory on February 3rd.
A week later, the first-year received Division I Defensive Player of the Week honors by the Collegiate Water Polo Association for her 38 combined saves, five assists, and five steals throughout two days of competition. Those saves helped propel Harvard to its best start in program history at 9-0.
Competing in high-pressure games early on in the season has been a challenge for a player so new to the collegiate scene. However, Banks credits the environment created by the leaders of the team as her ability to stay focused throughout the win streak and continue performing at her best inside the pool.
Building Chemistry Early On
The Crimson’s great chemistry has been a decisive factor in their dominant start in 2019. Senior attacker Kristen Hong gave credit to the freshman class as a big reason for the team’s early success. However, the team’s ability to gel so quickly across all class levels is the most impressive part about Harvard’s current position.
Starting their pre-season in Miami, the squad was given an opportunity to grow closer by spending every day with each other both in and out of the pool.
“Coming off of a fall season where we were not playing a lot to that where we spent everyday together brought us to get to know each other pretty well,” Banks said.
Although chemistry among the entire team took some time to develop, it seems as if the freshman class created a bond much earlier on and were able to build off of their connection.
Coming into her first year for the Crimson, Banks was familiar with both Grace Thawley and Borden Wahl through the Olympic Development program, where they first met before they even began high school. As for Evan and Inde, the chemistry between them and the rest of the freshmen was set upon the start, as the first-years found a connection right away.
“I think we have a strong connection between our whole class and I think it makes it a lot easier when times are tough,” Banks said. “We can always look at each other and say ‘we got this’ and it’s nice to have that connection in an out of the pool.”
This optimistic perspective has led Harvard to a 12-2 start on the season, and the Crimson hope to build off their tremendous start against a difficult second-half slate. However, the team’s bond and talent-level should hopefully carry Harvard a long way into the postseason.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
They’ve been raving about him all year, and once again, sophomore goalie Kyle Mullin got it done.
Mullin not only recorded a collegiate career high 20 saves, but his presence in goal was essential in Harvard’s 9-8 win over the Providence Friars (2-4) on Saturday. Despite being outshot 47-33, three of which came for the Friars in the final 15 seconds, the Crimson was able to hold on to a much needed win and move to 2-3 on the year heading into conference play.
Harvard (2-3) was at an immediate disadvantage going into the game, as the team was without senior defenseman and tricaptain Spencer Daniel, junior attackman and tricaptain Kyle Anderson, junior attackman and top goal scorer Ryan Graff, and junior defenseman David Strupp, who were all out with injuries. In addition, Providence (2-4, 0-0 Big East) was looking to make up for a tough 17-16 loss against Sacred Heart in their previous game, and are led by senior attackman Brendan Kearns, who was recently selected 60th overall in the Major League Lacrosse draft by the New York Lizards.
The high intensity first quarter ended with a 5-3 lead for the Crimson. Junior midfielder Nigel Andrews led the early attack for Harvard, netting two of the five goals. “I thought that we played some of our best lacrosse of the season at moments throughout the game, both on the defensive and offensive side of the ball,” said Andrews. “What we need to work on is being able to consistently play that well throughout the whole game. If we can figure that out we can play with anyone in the country.”
Consistency has been a focal point for the team this season, as the Crimson have let a few games slip away from them. A Feb. 23 home game against UMass saw a slight lack of concentration on the Harvard end lead to three goals in a matter of minutes for UMass that ultimately lead to a loss, and the next game against Holy Cross on Feb. 26 saw the Crimson lose a 10-3 lead and eventually fall 11-10 in double overtime.
Despite the tough losses, the team has been committed to staying focused and not letting some unfortunate games early in the year impact the entire rest of the season. Already up 5-3 at the end of the first quarter against Providence, the Crimson was determined to see this game all the way through until its end.
Harvard kept up the tough pace in the second quarter, outscoring the Friars 2-0 to go into halftime up 7-3. One of the two goals was scored by freshman attacker Austin Madronic, who has proved an incredible addition to the team this season. Heading into the game, Madronic had been named Ivy League Rookie of the Week, his second time receiving this honor in the first three weeks of his collegiate career.
The third quarter followed the same pattern as the second. Harvard’s phenomenal defense was able to shut out the Friars in back-to-back quarters, and sophomore midfielder Kyle Massimilian continued to win valuable faceoffs for the Crimson. Goals from sophomore attackman Myles Hamm and sophomore midfielder Kyle Salvatore (his third of the day) gave Harvard a 9-3 lead heading into the final quarter.
Whereas most would see this as a comfortable lead, the Crimson know that the game is not over until the final whistle blows. 50 seconds into the fourth quarter, Providence netted a goal which ended an incredible 36 minute and 16 second shutout run by Harvard. The goal was the first for the Friars since there was 5:26 left in the first quarter, but it would not be their last.
Providence picked up the pace in a major way, as the team gave its all in a comeback effort. Sure enough, with only 5:16 to go, the Friars had nearly come all the way back and found themselves down 9-8. “Providence really started to come alive in the fourth quarter and make a run,” said Mullin. “They were pushing the gas on offense and scoring goals.”
The game was following a similar script that the Crimson was used to, but this time, the team was set on writing a different ending.
With 48 seconds left in the game, Providence called a timeout after launching four shots in the previous minute, two of which Mullin saved, and one that deflected off the post. Mullin had been big all game, but the Crimson needed him just one last time.
Following the timeout, the Friars came back onto the field, and, in the final 15 seconds rattled off three consecutive shots, none of which were able to find the back net. The incredible saves gave Harvard its second win of the season and a great deal of momentum heading into Ivy League play.
The team was very aware of the situation they were in and how important it was to close the game out strongly. “Before Providence, we’ve had two games where we had a lead and the other team came back late,” said Mullin, speaking of the UMass and Holy Cross games. “The last minute of the fourth quarter on Saturday was a situation we had been in before, and we were confident that we were gonna make the stop. Thankfully, we did and were able to get our first win at home.”
It will be a while until the team returns home for a matchup with Albany on March 27, but Kyle Mullin and the Crimson will be plenty busy until then, with games against Brown, Boston University, and Dartmouth to fill the void in the meantime.

Every year around Housing Day, PAFs, proctors, and the College at large trip over themselves to tell freshmen exactly what to expect and what to do. But for upperclassmen, it’s not as clear how you should go about Housing Day, from dorm-storming to skipping classes. So, we put together some advice for those of us on the other end of that fateful Thursday. If you’re going to pretend to love Harvard for one day a year, you should go hard, right?
Listen to HoCo
We know, it sounds like the most boring tip in the world, but each house does actually have its own procedure on the morning of Housing Day. Your HoCo should have a plan in place, so be sure to know what’s happening when. That way you won’t wake up earlier than you need to...or, worse, stumble into the dining hall after everyone’s already gone. Which brings us to...
You Don’t Actually Need to Wake Up That Early
If you want to grab breakfast and hang out with the growing crowd, then you can be up at 6 a.m., or whatever floats your boat. But realistically, even if your house is super aggressive about being the first to Harvard Yard, don’t expect to leave on time. Nothing is stopping you from just rolling out of bed and joining the dorm-stormers.
Dress Practically
The only reason you might want to be on time to breakfast is to make sure you get a t-shirt in a size you prefer. If your HoCo is good about sizing in their orders, this shouldn’t be an issue, but if you’d rather be safe then go for it. And don’t wear something you particularly like to storm dorms. Mud and/or snow is almost guaranteed to get all over your footwear (and possibly your pants!) as you cavort around the Yard, and you do not want to be the sucker in white sneakers.
To Alcohol or Not to Alcohol?
Maybe we’re all really freshmen at heart, because while they debate whether or not to River Run, we’re deciding if pregaming on a Wednesday night is the smart thing to do. Some people truly think they should stay up all night, which sounds terrifying to us, but you do have spring break to sleep it off…
Overall we’re on the fence about whether or not alcohol actually improves the Housing Day experience. Yeah, it would be funny to go to your morning classes plastered, but the dorm-storming itself is a messy business of running up and down cramped staircases. You decide if you want to be sober for that or not.
It’s Not About You!
As nice as it is to see that some houses really can manage to muster up spirit for one day, the most important thing to keep in mind is that Housing Day is about the freshmen, not you. Dorm-storming is fun for us, but it can be really overwhelming to have a crowd of questionably sober upperclassmen rushing into your suite. Enjoy yourself, but be conscious of how freaked out the people in the suite are, and consider dialling it back every now and then.
We know that housing is not that deep, and the vast majority of people grow to really love where they live. Freshmen don’t necessarily know how true that is. So if you’re in an “unpopular” house, take a moment to reassure the incoming class. And if you’re in a “popular” house, feel free to wild out...but don’t take it out on frosh who get an “unpopular” one. Your personality can be more than just hating on the Quad, you know.
Extenuating Circumstances
In general we are very pro-skip-your-classes for such an occasion. But there are certain circumstances that mean even house pride should be put aside. If you have a midterm, for the love of all that is good, go to your midterm. Seniors, if you’re turning in your thesis the night before Housing Day, don’t put off your work. Housing Day is really fun, but it will come another year for most of us.
Whether you’re new to Housing Day as an upperclassman or not, the prospect of a quarter of the college finding out where they’ll spend the next three years deserves celebration. This housing day, have a blast with your house and Harvard spirit, and make it a day that the freshmen will remember.

Lowell House is every freshman’s dream — newly renovated, a sweet community, and a source of all the funky traditions you could ever ask for. The House’s unofficial mascot is Bacchus, the Roman god of festivities, which is wholly appropriate considering the fact that any first-years lucky enough to get sorted into Lowell will be celebrating all year long. If you’re looking to find out more about the teas, speeches, and other perks that make Lowell great, we’ve got the inside scoop for you!
The days of swing housing are over! The centrally located and beautifully updated space will house all Lowellians beginning this fall. Lowell’s new house will host 415 lucky students, which is up from the 370 previously in swing housing. We got the low(ell) down on what living in the new house will be like (spoiler alert: it’s a dream come true!). One of Lowell’s current HoCo Chairs, Carrington L. Walsh ’20, informed us that Lowell’s new house will have several large suites, with most housing five or more students.
Lowellians will also have access to two courtyards and a whole host of amenities. Some of the luxuries Lowellians can look forward to in the new house include a number of music practice rooms, a yoga studio, basketball court, a “maker space” outfitted with a 3D-printer, a party lounge, and a movie screening room, to name just a few. New Lowell residents will get the privilege of moving into a completely new space and being the first to explore all the nooks and crannies of the new buildings.
Lowell’s new space might be the most visible feature of the house, but the community is what makes Lowell truly special. Even during swing housing, Lowellians tend to gather together and make any space feel cozy. A quick trip to the Lowtel perfectly captures the essence of Lowell House. At virtually any time of day (or night!), students in the house can be found hanging out, playing ping pong, collaborating on psets, or just catching up in the dhall and lobby. We’re certain Lowellians will appreciate their new digs this fall, and the spirit of the Lowell community that kept the house close during swing will make sophomores instantly feel at home. Akash Bagaria ’21, a sophomore living in the Lowtel, — the building that houses the dining hall — affirmed the oft-repeated line that Lowell’s community is everything to its residents. When asked to compare Lowell to a TV show, Bagaria said, “Lowell is The Office, for sure. Not only because I’m a huge fan of The Office…but also because there’s quite the assortment of characters in Lowell…and I’ve gotten to meet those people through the various steins and teas that have been arranged on a weekly basis.” If you’re not sold on Lowell by the chance to live life in everyone’s favorite Netflix binge series, we don’t know what to tell you.
House spirit is easy to spot if you spend any length of time at Lowell. From their notoriously goofy House-wide email list to the Lowell speeches series, students in the House seem to truly love being a part of the Lowell family. One particularly visible quirk is the rubber duck. What started as a prank on a tutor has escalated into a joke across the entire house, and now little rubber ducks can be found in almost “any Lowell building in swing,” according to Walsh (fun fact: if you look closely, there are a few watching over the Lowtel dhall). While Lowellians themselves are the source of the house’s beloved inside jokes, the end of swing housing signals the return of one of Lowell’s wackiest traditions, the Lowell Bellringer Society. Trained by Russian monks, this group of Lowellians is a mysterious society dedicated to the proper care and ringing of the house’s beloved bells, an audible reminder of the residents’ dedication to Lowell’s unique culture.
While Lowell is all about fun and games, they also know how to throw a good party. Future Lowellians can look forward to breaking in the new space with Glowell, Yule Ball, and Bacchanalia, which take place in October, December, and May, respectively. Events at Lowell are hardly an occasional occurrence, though. Lowell’s Thursday Teas are an iconic part of House culture, drawing students from all classes to enjoy conversation, treats, and tea together near the end of the weekly grind. The Lowtel has hosted teas during swing housing, but the event traditionally takes place in a Faculty Dean’s residence. The teas also feature Tea Fairies, including Walsh. Tea Fairy duties are just as magical as the name implies: they make “the most delicious homemade baked goods,” according to former HoCo chair Juliana R. Rodriguez ’19, who jokes that her tea attendance is better than her class attendance. The company and beverages are warm, and the built-in time to decompress from the stress of school draws crowds from all around campus.
First-years sorted into Lowell can look forward to joining a community that endures beyond graduation. Rodriguez says that Lowell’s “vibrant” Senior Common Room is a lesser-known but incredibly important feature of the House’s spirit. Alumni of Lowell House (which include icons like Matt Damon and Natalie Portman) tend to affiliate with the House’s Senior Common Room and remain active members of House life in events like High Table, in which Lowell seniors get the opportunity for a wholesome meal and reflection on their time at Harvard with members of the Senior Common Room. The students and staff also duke it out over Trivia Night, a semesterly head-to-head battle between the Junior and Senior Common Rooms — a competition Walsh describes as “very heated and very fun.” For those less familiar with the ins and outs of Lowell life, the Junior Common Room is both a room in the new house as well as a community made up of all undergraduates living in or affiliated with Lowell. The Senior Common Room, like the JCR, will occupy a space in the new house, and is a network of alumni, tutors, administrators, and Harvard community members that choose to affiliate with the house. Together, both groups make life in the house the perfect combination of quirky, wholesome, and genuine for those lucky enough to call Lowell home.
Just in case you haven’t heard enough about Lowell, we asked the current and former Lowell HoCo chairs some hard-hitting questions about the house.
We know all the first-years are excited for Lowell because it’s a shiny new house, but what else do you think potential Lowellians should know about the House?
CW: It’s the spirit of Lowell that makes Lowell, not just the house.
JR: Like, we love the new building and we’re excited to move back into the House...
CW: ...but there’s so much more to it than just a building!
If you could describe Lowell in two words, what would it be? 
CW: Accessible bougieness, that’s exactly what Lowell is!
Anything else you want first-years to know about Lowell?
CW: Lowell your expectations! Bust down Lowelliana! No, but seriously — Get Lowell!

Adams House radiates both class and convenience, from its walls covered with real gold to its muraled underground tunnel system. The lucky group of freshmen sorted into Adams will receive a cigar and a rose upon joining this storied group of tea-drinkers. Adams House and its community are worth (literal) gold, and they’re willing to bet their cigars on it!
As Adams House Committee co-chair Victoria “Tori” S. Tong ’20 puts it, “It’s a good-lookin’ house!” Adams currently houses around 450 residents in Randolph Hall, Westmorly Court, Russell Hall, Claverly Hall, and Apthorp House, with the latter housing the beloved faculty deans, Judy S. Palfrey ’67 and John “Sean” G. Palfrey ’67.
To the starry-eyed first-years who have heard different rumors about the renovations for next year: No need to fear! The housing situation literally couldn’t be better. Most sophomores are normally placed into Claverly Hall, a stout building on the corner of Linden and Bow street. As this will be renovated first, however, sophomores are being moved into either Fairfax Hall above Gnomon Copy, Hampden Hall above the Harvard Bookstore, or into the Inn that currently houses Lowell residents.
Sophomores are likely to receive n+1 housing, some of which come with kitchens in case you get tired of the gorgeous dining hall. As if this weren’t enough, the swing housing is still close enough to Adams to leave for that 8:00 p.m. meeting at 7:55. Most juniors and seniors live in Randolph Hall, Westmorly Court, or Russell Hall. With quality singles and common rooms so spacious that HoCo co-chair Caroline S. Kristof ’20 has an organ in hers, Adams is nothing short of comfortable. Comfort doesn’t come at the cost of elegance, though — one look around Adams and it’s no wonder that the house once served as a luxurious housing alternative for wealthy Harvard men in the late 19th century.
If you’re looking for some fresh air, head to a hammock on the green and luscious Randolph courtyard; if you’re searching for some inspiration, step into the underground tunnels decorated by Harvard students who enjoy quoting Robert Frost, Class of 1899, writing zany bucket lists, or painting murals. Whether you’re warming up with friends near the fireplace in FDR’s suite or printing something with the 3D printer in the art space, there’s something for everyone in Adams.
What do the Adams resident dean, social chair, security guard, and everyday Adams residents have in common? They all stopped by to say hello during our interview with the HoCo chairs! “Interrupted” isn’t the right way describe it; they all greeted us with an warm and welcoming enthusiasm that would make anyone feel at home.
The classic Adams event is its weekly stein called Carpe Noctem. People gather together every Thursday night in the stylish lower common room for food, music, and a good time. As Tong puts it, “There isn’t a single person in Adams who doesn't know what [Carpe] is.” With themes like “Pong Carpe,” where residents (and better-skilled deans) sign up for a good old-fashioned game of beer pong and "Chocoholica”, during which people eat everything and anything encrusted with chocolate, Carpe helps establish a great sense of community among Adams residents.
The House is dressed with plenty of other traditions as well, including Drag Night, Fireside Chats, and shows in the Pool Theatre. They recently held one formal in the courtyard with lanterns and a homemade dance floor constructed by the students themselves, and another formal in their elegant library (obviously the Harvard grind never stops). Since plenty of students from other houses stop by Adams to meet at a convenient location, the house is always bustling with people and serves as a reliable hub for busy upperclassmen.
With so many common rooms sprinkled throughout the house and luscious spaces for performing, psetting, or partying, the community is wholesome and welcoming of everyone. Don’t let its elegant style and fruit-infused water intimidate you — there’s definitely a home to be found here.
If you’re still not convinced, we caught up with the HoCo chairs to get a very serious inside scoop on Adams.
What dessert or candy would Adams be? 
CK: Something boujee but fruity and nice — like chocolate covered strawberries. Does that count?
What Harry Potter house would Adams house be sorted into?
VT: I’m tempted to say Gryffindor because of the red and gold, but imagine a combination of Gryffindor — great and courageous with a really strong community — and the lovely kindness of Hufflepuff.

Quincy’s residents swear that you could live almost your entire life in Quincy and not miss a thing. The central location of this house means that your friends will always be willing to catch a meal with you (or you’ll see them cutting through the courtyard on the way to the river). Whether you’re into art, sports, or other pursuits, Quincy House will accept you into its social Quommunity with open arms.
Quincy House is divided into New Quincy and Stone Hall, which is slightly confusing since the latter was recently renovated in 2014. Sophomores usually get hallway doubles in Stone Hall, but some blocking groups can end up in New Quincy. Although only a few lucky sophomores get hallway singles, by junior and senior year, anyone who wants a single can get one, and all the floors have common rooms. Many rooms have a great view of the Quincy courtyard.
While many rooms in Quincy have parties over the weekends, one well-known party suite is the balcony suite on the 3rd floor of New Quincy, which ironically overlooks the library. Every semester, the students in this room host a house-wide party which can get crazy; Fall 2018’s party was lab-themed, and in addition to mad scientists, past schemes have involved bringing in sand for a Baywatch party.
Quincy House is known for its lovely Qube library, which is replete with cushy chairs, lots of stuffed animals, and a huge window with a view of the House courtyard. Other study spaces include the Junior Common Room (where pianists commonly practice), the classrooms in the basement of Stone Hall (which have wrap-around tables), and the dhall (where you can hide behind the Christmas trees during fall semester reading period). For the more relaxed periods of the day, many Penguins like to let their hair down outside the House in the Quincy Quammock, the tables in the courtyard, or simply the dhall. Quincy also boasts its own grille, and according to resident Kaiwen Li ’21 who works there, “It’s a great chance to get to meet people.” Quincy also has a pottery studio in the basement next to the gym, and two students run classes there.
The faculty deans, Lee and Deborah J. Gehrke, have a penthouse suite on the top floor of New Quincy. “They do these open houses where they'll have 900 cupcakes, very different flavors, and at the beginning of the year they do a Sophomore Barbecue Cookout up there,” said HoCo co-chair Sierra M. Moore ‘20. Their dog, Ripley, however, is apparently the real ‘Quincy Queen.’ "She goes to all our IMs and she'll come running through the dhall, and she's just absolutely so sweet. It's always a toss-up whether she's going to notice you or not,” Moore says with a laugh.
Quincy House made history this past year by winning the Straus Cup. “Quincy is really special when it comes to IMs...so many different types of people will actually go play,” Moore says.
Quincy’s defining community aspect is its homey vibe. “People are very outgoing, generally. So when they see someone they know, it's not just a good quick, ‘hey what's up’ and they're already past you. You know, it's sort of like, go stop and talk,” says Moore.
Quincy is also known for its delicious meals and the Harvard University Dining Services staff has a close bond with students. Greg, a HUDS employee, will remind you what you forgot to grab that morning when you’re rushing to class, and Maria makes a mean grilled cheese sandwich. “Sometimes I go to the other houses, but our house is here,” says Ana Braga, who has worked for HUDS in Quincy House for 18 years.
Still curious about what it’s like to live in Quincy? The HoCo chair filled us in.
What are some misconceptions people have about Quincy? 
SM: I think people say, ‘oh, Quincy thinks they are a great house,’ and we are a great house, so misconception confirmed!
Could you tell me about the dhall mural?
SM: No one really knows what is up with the mural. We have a lot of funky art around Quincy...We recognize that it's a little weird-looking but we like it, but only Quincy people can say that it's weird...I'm very protective of our ugly, cute things.
Why did you decide to run for HoCo?
SM: I really wanted all these different events in Quincy that I felt would make it even better...I wanted even more people to find what I had found in Quincy.
