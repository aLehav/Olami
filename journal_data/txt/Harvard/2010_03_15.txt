After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UNC-Duke. Auburn-Alabama. Kentucky-Louisville.
Oftentimes the best rivalries are between intrastate competitors, especially when both teams are among the nation’s elite.
Such will be the case tomorrow afternoon when the No. 12 Harvard men’s lacrosse team takes on No. 18 Massachusetts at 1 pm at Garber Field in Amherst.
“It’s definitely a rivalry within the state,” sophomore attackman Jeff Cohen said. “They’re also one of the top teams in the country, and we’re trying to climb the ladder to be one of the top teams in the country as well.”
In its second game against a nationally-ranked opponent this season, the Crimson will be looking to build on its 9-7 victory against Holy Cross last Saturday.
To win, Harvard’s defense will have to contain a high-powered Minutemen offense that has averaged 14.5 goals per game on the year and has outshot opponents 168-130 on the season.
“I think our D will really have to step it up this week,” senior defenseman Billy Geist said.
In net trying to stop the Massachusetts attack will either be freshman Harry Krieger or sophomore Christian Coates.
Coates picked up the win against Canisus in the season opener, giving up just four goals in 45 minutes of playing time, but he struggled in allowing 13 goals in a loss against No. 14 Georgetown his next time out. Head coach John Tillman gave Krieger his first career start against the Crusaders, and he gave up seven goals and earned the victory.
Cohen said the starter will be determined by practice performance this week, but no matter who’s in net, the team will be ready to go.
“We’re confident in either of them,” he said.
Whoever is in goal will be focused on stopping the Minutemen’s best weapon, senior midfielder Bobby Hayes, a 2010 Preseason All-New England selection who already has 11 goals on the year.
Joining him on the attack will be junior Ryan Hantverk, who has nine goals, and sophomore Art Kell, who has eight.
Harvard, meanwhile, will hope for another strong game from junior attackman Dean Gibbons, who had four goals against Holy Cross, giving him a team-best ten on the season. Cohen is second on the team with eight.
If Harvard is going to keep up with Massachusetts’ high scoring offense, it will likely need to amass more than the nine goals it managed against the Crusaders. That means the rest of the attack—junior Matt Hull, sophomores Kevin Vaughn and Dan McDermott, and a group of freshman—will need to bring their best efforts.
“I think it would definitely be good to hit the double-digit goal mark,” Cohen said. “But we have confidence in our defense and our goalie that if we do score nine on a certain day, they’ll pick us up.”
One thing the Harvard offense will especially focus on tomorrow is getting off to a fast start. The Crimson trailed Holy Cross, 4-1, last weekend before pulling ahead. The team also fell behind, 13-8, against the Hoyas, before mounting a furious rally but eventually falling, 13-12.
“Coming out of the gates quick is something we’ve focused on,” Geist said. “I’m pretty confident we’ll do that this weekend.”
The offense will try to do so against inexperienced Minutemen goalie Tim McCormack, who will be starting just his fifth career game and first against a ranked opponent. The sophomore has defeated Albany, Sacred Heart, and Hartford but lost to Yale, and he owns a .379 save percentage on the season.
“I played against [McCormack] in high school,” Cohen said. “He’s a really good player. Maybe the fact that this will be one of his first big-game starts could be an issue, but I wouldn’t bank on it. He’ll come to play.”
One of Harvard’s biggest strengths this season has been its ability to cause turnovers, forcing 23.7 per game. However, they will have a tough time maintaining that average against a Massachusetts team that has averaged only 14.25 giveaways per contest.
“If we can get one or two extra possessions in a game, in a one-goal game that could translate to a win for us,” Cohen said.
Last season, the Minutemen forced 14 Harvard giveaways in handing the Crimson its worst loss of the season, 7-3. In that matchup, each team was ranked one spot higher than it is now—Harvard came in at No. 11, and Massachusetts was No. 17. Hayes and Kell each had a goal in that game, and the Crimson was unable to do much scoring against Minutemen senior goalie Doc Schneider despite outshooting Massachusetts 39-21.
That defeat has fueled Harvard, especially the team’s seniors, who want to improve their record to 2-2 against their interstate rivals. Retribution is something that will certainly be on the minds of the entire team.
“All week, coach has been harping on us that last year they came into our home stadium and bullied us around a little bit,” Cohen said. “So that’s definitely on the back of our minds.”
“It was our toughest loss last year,” Geist added. “A pretty emotional loss for a lot of guys. So we’re definitely excited about this weekend, and hopefully we can win it back.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tied in the third set at 5-5 with the match in the balance, junior Aba Omodele-Lucien shrugged off the pressure, winning his match, 7-5, to lift Harvard men’s tennis (7-4) to a 4-3 victory over St. John’s (2-6) on Friday at the Murr Center.
“I don’t think we were prepared for St. John’s to be playing as well as they did,” Omodele-Lucien said. “Last time we played them, it was a little easier. So, we started on our heels, which is always the wrong thing to do. They caught a lot of us off guard.”
The Crimson started the match on a strong note by picking up the doubles point with all three teams defeated their Red Storm opponents.
But the singles matches proved much tougher to win.
“We started off slow in singles,” Omodele-Lucien said. “It was hard to rebound and luckily we could.”
Freshman Josh Tchan was the first to finish at singles. He won in two sets, 6-3, 6-4, at the No. 4 slot.
Tchan’s efficient victory, though, was followed up by two Harvard losses.
At the No. 6 position, sophomore Davis Mangham dropped both sets, 6-4, to his St. John’s opponent.
Christo Schultz finished his match soon after with a three-set loss. Despite a strong second frame, the freshman could not carry his momentum into the third set, and he lost in the No. 5 slot, 1-6, 6-3, 3-6.
“St. John’s coming out as strong as they did in singles because of their results against the other Ivies was surprising,” Crimson coach Dave Fish explained. “To all of a sudden be in a dog fight with them was unexpected for us.”
Whereas Harvard recently beat Brown, Princeton, and Columbia en route to an ECAC Indoor Championship title, the Red Storm lost to Ivy League teams Cornell, Dartmouth, and Princeton.
Following Schultz’s loss, attention then turned to the first three courts, each featuring close battles.
The crowd watched intently as sophomore Alistair Felton played a drawn-out third set. Down 3-5, Felton made an impressive turnaround and picked up the next game, conceding only one point. But from there the sophomore faltered, ultimately losing, 6-4, 3-6, 4-6, in the No. 3 slot.
At the same time on the first court, junior Alexei Chijoff-Evans picked up a three-set victory for Harvard, 6-4, 4-6, 6-2. The win at the No. 1 spot meant the match was tied at three apiece.
With the game riding on his shoulders, Omodele-Lucien didn’t think twice about the pressure.
“You have to tell yourself that you can’t worry about the result,” Omodele-Lucien explained. “If you worry about the result you won’t perform well. The most important thing in a tight situation like that is to play your game well and focus on each shot rather than the score.”
Up 6-5 against St. John’s Milo Hauk, Omodele-Lucien lived up to his words. After dropping the first point, he countered with two solid serves to capture the upper hand at 30-15. An unforced error gave him a bigger lead at 40-15.
Then, a double fault gave the Red Storm a point to make the score 40-30. In the next exchange, Omodele-Lucien’s opponent lobbed a shot into the back corner to knot the score at deuce. Yet, Omodele-Lucien held on and captured the next two points for a 4-6, 6-1, 7-5 victory.
“To see Aba come in with such a big win after losing the first set to a guy whose game style was a nightmare for Aba’s game was great for us,” Fish said.
Fish also made note of the team’s impressive efforts despite the inevitable mid-semester fatigue.
“Our guys were pretty exhausted from exams week, and they were really just running on fumes yesterday [against Radford],” Fish said. “I think they came out and showed a lot of guts and a lot of team spirit when they didn’t have a lot to run on.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After an impressive sweep of Princeton last weekend in the first round of ECAC playoffs, the Harvard men’s hockey team (9-20-3, 7-11-3 ECAC) dropped the first game of a three-game quarterfinal series to No. 9 Cornell (18-8-4, 13-5-3 ECAC) on Friday night. The Big Red used the energy of its fans, the talent of its freshmen, and the effectiveness of its power play in a dominant 5-1 win over the Crimson at Lynah Rink.
Freshmen Nick D’Agostino and Riley Nash each scored a pair of goals to lead Cornell while junior Pier-Olivier Michaud scored the lone goal for Harvard off of an assist from freshmen teammates Conor Morrison and Danny Beiga in the loss. Mike Devin, Patrick Kennedy, Blake Gallagher and Tyler Roeszler tallied assists for the Big Red, and senior Colin Greening recorded the first goal of the game only 4: 35 into the opening period.
“I think [Friday night’s game] was a great disappointment for our team,” captain Alex Biega said, “but the good thing about best of three series is we have another shot on Saturday.”
Cornell has the opportunity to close the series Saturday night and move to the ECAC semifinals with a second win over the Crimson. The Big Red is now 3-0 against Harvard this season, winning 6-3 and 3-0 in November and February respectively in addition to the victory Friday night.
Despite the disparity of the score, Cornell only had a 29-27 shot advantage over the Crimson. Harvard goaltender Kyle Richter had 21 saves on the game before being substituted by replacement netminder, junior Ryan Carroll who made three saves in the final ten minutes of the game. On the other end of the ice, the Big Red’s Ben Scrivens made 26 saves in keeping the Crimson offense at bay. Scrivens, a senior, was recently unanimously named to the All-Ivy League first team after leading the Ancient Eight with a 2.43 goals-against average, a .921 save percentage, and a 6-4 Ivy record.
“[Cornell] doesn’t give up anything defensively,” Biega said. “We need to focus on making their best players play in their defensive zone and capitalize on our own opportunities.”
Greening put Cornell on the scoreboard early in the first period, but Harvard was quick to respond, recording its sole goal only five minutes later. D’Agostino put the Big Red in the lead for good with his score to close the first period, finishing a rebound off of a shot from teammate Mike Devin.
The freshman scored again in the second off of a 3-on-2 break with Gallagher and Roeszler who overwhelmed the Crimson defense.
Fellow freshman, Nash, took over in the third period, recording the two final goals of the game, off of a shot into the left corner of the goal and a rebound respectively, making the score 5-1.
The rivalry between Cornell and Harvard was alive and evident through the tide of Big Red fans, who opened the game by characteristically throwing dead fish at the Harvard lineup. The fans, as much as the players themselves, controlled the momentum of the game.
“We can’t let the crowd get us off our game,” Richter said, following the loss. “Their crowd always give them a definitely home-ice advantage…and it plays a bit of a factor in our game.”
Looking forward to Saturday night’s game, the Crimson believes it has great room for improvement and still has a shot at pulling the upset.
“If we can play a full 60-minute game and limit their offensive zone, I think we can find success [Saturday night].”
After a 5-1 opening loss, the only way Harvard can really go is up.

Many of us Harvard students weren’t exactly known as the  popular kids in high school. But it seems that as a university, we’re  doing pretty well on the popularity scale. Still, we're not yet king.
U.S.  News and World Report released its rankings of the  Most Popular Colleges earlier this month. Harvard was named the second  most popular university, trailing Brigham Young University for the top  slot.
The rankings are based on schools’ yields—the percentage of accepted  students who choose to attend. Harvard’s yield last year was 76 percent;  BYU’s was 78 percent.
The Deseret News cited BYU's  affiliation with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints as the  major factor in its popularity: the school draws students who want to  participate in Mormon culture in college and who are attracted by the  discounted tuition of $2,145 per semester for church members. BYU  students quoted in the article said that they wouldn't want to attend  Harvard—one said the tough academics would have made her "feel so insecure" about herself, and another said BYU extracurriculars are clearly better because he hasn't "seen Harvard on ESPN."
Curious about whom we did beat? Even with its  sunny weather, Stanford University was ranked third, with a yield of 71  percent. The rest of the top five was filled by University of Nebraska-Lincoln at fourth, and Yale University at fifth. Another institution with a religious draw, Yeshiva University, came in at sixth.
