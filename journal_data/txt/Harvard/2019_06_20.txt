This review contains spoilers for the second season premiere of “Big Little Lies.”
“What have they done?” asks the title of the premiere of “Big Little Lies”’s hotly anticipated second season. It’s a rhetorical, moralizing question as much as it is a literal one. After all, two years after the first season, we’re in need of a recap.
The Monterey Five (as they have come to be locally known) find themselves in the aftermath of Perry’s (Alexander Skarsgård) grisly death by staircase tumble — and at the center of the greatest gossip to hit Monterey’s elementary school carpool. Reeling in the post traumatic stress is Celeste (Nicole Kidman), whose abuse at the hands of her late husband doesn’t negate her feelings of culpability, nor the genuine affection that once existed at the heart of her former marriage. “Even in death, his message lives on: That you’re to blame,” her therapist Dr. Amanda Reisman (Robin Weigert) says trenchantly. “You’re always to blame.”
Yes, even if Perry is dead, his corpse casts a large shadow over an otherwise sunny Monterey. He looms large in Celeste’s ominous dreams, a persistent figure of power whose toxic influence leeches into her life, even after the threat has been eliminated.
And if it’s not one thing, it’s a mother: Mary Louise (Meryl Streep), Celeste’s mother-in-law, comes to town after her son’s death under the pretext of caring for her grandchildren — with the not-so-inconspicuous ulterior motive of investigating what exactly transpired that fateful night. And no, she doesn’t buy Madeline’s (Reese Witherspoon) police testimony insistence that Perry tripped and fell down the stairs, probably because she finds “little people to be untrustworthy.” It’s just one in a series of unwieldy lines in the script, uttered capably by the heavily lauded actress.
Madeline, meanwhile, has her own battles to fight, namely dealing with her daughter Abigail (Kathryn Newton), who’s back on her Gen-Z progressive bullshit, trying to save the world by foregoing a liberal arts college education in favor of working for a charitable start-up. Ah, the age-old battle of socially-minded teenage idealism against parental adherence to convention. Abigail’s grand plans clearly do not comport with Madeline’s staunch insistence that Abigail grow up to be a dutiful coastal elite: “I don’t care about fucking homeless people!” she shrieks.
In the juggling act of the show’s second season, Streep is just one new element in the mix, which seems desperate to ratify the fact of its own existence. English director Andrea Arnold, who has taken the reins this season from Jean-Marc Vallée, is another. If Arnold’s “Fish Tank” — a piercing, lovely arthouse drama about a British latchkey kid — is any indication, then the second season of “Big Little Lies” is clearly eyeing next year’s Golden Globes, which it unequivocally swept last year. Add star power like Streep in the mix, and the future looks bright.
Still, lightning rarely strikes twice. Despite its Avengers-like assembly of Hollywood’s best and brightest — a line-up so exciting, the show’s promotional material cleverly bills their last names in an enigmatic crossword mnemonic — “Big Little Lies” has yet to justify its second season, beyond wanting to strike it rich with another surefire success.
Some obvious problems remain unsolved. There’s the question of whether truth will out — that Bonnie Carlson (Zoe Kravitz) had a heavier hand in Perry’s death than, say, gravity. Unresolved tensions between Madeline and her second husband, Ed (a wonderfully muted, refreshingly dramatic Adam Scott) remain, especially after that torrid affair with the local theater director.
Still, the 2017 finale of Season One felt (at least spiritually) complete. Those beautiful shots of Reese Witherspoon and Laura Dern on the beach! Nicole Kidman’s bangs fluttering gently in the wind! The monster was vanquished, the princess rescued from the tower. At least judging by last week’s premiere, there hasn’t been enough concrete narrative indication that the show needed another season. If “Big Little Lies” wants enough momentum to sustain another season, it’ll need another few elements in the juggling act.

This review contains spoilers for the second episode of “Big Little Lies” season two.
Remember how last week’s Season Two premiere of “Big Little Lies” didn’t have enough going on? Well, it seems in retrospect like the show was just getting its bearings. “Tell-Tale Heart,” the second episode in the season, effectively quashes all fears that Season Two will run out of steam. Plenty is rotten in Monterey, where another mother has joined the mix: Bonnie’s mother Elizabeth Howard (Crystal Fox), who’s been tipped off by Bonnie’s husband Nathan (James Tupper) that something’s amiss with her daughter. First Mary Louise, now Elizabeth… Is this town just one festering cesspool of mommy issues?
Conventional wisdom, however antiquated, dictates that mothers usually have a sixth sense about their kids. But in “Tell-Tale Heart,” it seems like Elizabeth literally has a sixth sense, showing up on the scene to call Nathan out for his dearth of emotional intelligence (deservedly), as well as to dispense random, foreboding bits of wisdom like “I have been having visions lately… I see lots of water, and somebody’s drowning.” She also shows up in the middle of the night to deposit what looks like half a chicken wing, a feather, and a crystal at Bonnie and Nathan’s bedside. Not to mention, she reminds Bonnie ominously of “what happened last time.” Last time… Bonnie murdered someone? Casual!
Gratifying Elizabeth’s vision of death by water would mean paying off a frustratingly obvious bit of foreshadowing, especially for a show that’s managed to plant subtle clues and circle back to them organically. Consider Jane’s recurring visions of confronting her anonymous rapist, only to finally realize in last season’s finale that the rapist — and by extension, Ziggy’s father — was actually Perry. An excellent reveal, made only more excellent by the weeks’ worth of suspenseful build-up.
“Tell-Tale Heart” returns to this plotline in the most gut-wrenching way: After Madeline’s daughter Chloe (Darby Camp) lets slip that Max and Josh (Nicholas and Cameron Crovetti) are Ziggy’s (Iain Armitage) brothers, Jane finds herself tasked with the impossible job of sensitively conveying to her son that he is the product of sexual assault. The resulting conversation between mother and son is a tender reminder that “Big Little Lies” excels in these small, human moments — ones that don’t require flashy plot devices. A brief scene toward the end of the episode sees Celeste and Jane uniting their sons in a fragmented, but touching union by two women who turn their suffering into love. If anything good could be borne out of Perry’s violence, it’s this makeshift family.
Still, Celeste’s post-Perry life is far from normal, as “Tell-Tale Heart” zeroes in on the ever-present reality of post-traumatic stress. Celeste continues to grapple with her flashbacks in therapy — a particularly harrowing imagining of Madeline in her place sparks a visceral reaction — while also contending with Mary Louise’s increasingly probing questions about the circumstances of Perry’s death, as well as her threat to go to the police in search of answers.
Elsewhere, families are unhappy in their own ways. While Chloe leaks the secret about Ziggy’s father, her older sister Abigail accidentally reveals her mother’s affair in front of Ed (Adam Scott), whose frustration about being left in the dark in their marriage has built to the breaking point. Season Two is proving to be a breakout moment for Scott’s character, who thus far has been a supportive background presence in the Mackenzie household, but not much more. “Tell-Tale Heart” allows Scott to flex dramatic muscles that have been missing in his previous comedic roles.
Even so, it’d be hard to unequivocally award Adam Scott performance of the week, especially with Laura Dern around. Ed’s muted anger pales in comparison to Renata’s fully-fledged outburst at the news that her husband Gordon (Jeffrey Nordling) bet and lost their substantial wealth — including the ranch! — in a stock-shorting scheme. “I will not not be rich,” she hisses at the police station, punctuating each succinct syllable with a forceful jab at the glass wall separating them. It’s the line of the week, and for good reason: Laura Dern knows how to throw a tantrum.
So, what’s next for the Monterey Five? It’s probably a safe bet that scriptwriter David E. Kelley will substantiate Elizabeth’s visions of drowning, however predictable they might be. There’s also the likely possibility that Mary Louise’s threat to go to the police will result in a full-on custody battle for Max and Josh, especially with their mother’s Ambien-fueled car crash. Meanwhile it remains to be seen whether Madeleine and Ed — or Renata and Gordon, for that matter — will last the season. Like the show’s recurring title card shot, it seems like more than a few marriages are on the rocks.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
HEBRON, PALESTINE — It’s an hour before sunset during the last week of Ramadan. We’re walking through the shop-lined alleys of the old town. 
 The little boys who man the candy stalls —riled up by the thought of iftar, so close — are neglecting their duties, throwing loose gummies, straying away, chatting. The traffic and the volume of the city has started to cook with anticipation. People are packing up, shutting down, rushing to head home.
In these alleys, cut like canyons between ancient buildings, it might as well be dusk already. The tarps and fencing Palestinians have rigged — to protect from rocks and other detritus thrown down by Israeli settlers on the floors above — also block the evening light. On the streets above, though, guarded by soldiers too young to really look the part – one licking a popsicle as he fingers his gun — the sun slants through, ready to sink down like a golden round of pita into a bowl of hummus.
We’re hungry too — two American tourists who are fasting partly because when in Rome and partly because it just doesn’t feel right to do otherwise. Even though we snuck water from time to time, because it was upwards of 100 degrees and we were constantly on the move, the lack of food leaves us with stomach pangs. My stomach really does hurt — right in the upper left corner, hot and sharp — but I can’t tell if it is the hunger or a sense of shame. So many have stopped us, asked us where we’re from, and when we respond America, have shaken their heads: “Americans are good people, but your country is very bad for us Palestinians.” I can’t help but feel this darkness in my national being. I appreciate the distinction, but it also feels sort of thin — the difference made up by nothing more than an “n.”
I heard recently that the gut is the second brain, and I believe it. All through my teenage years, my stomach used to ache from anxiety. I sometimes wouldn’t eat: hunger and anxiety turning on each other, riling each other up just below my rib cage. Here again, in Hebron, my hunger pangs and pangs of something else — an anxious guilt — seem to be one and the same. I’m not going to lie though: I eat the evening meal without thinking. Maybe I should be slower and more cautious, but the food really just tastes so good, and I really am just so hungry.
All my love and thanks to Mo’min and his friends, Islam, and everyone else who treated us so well in Hebron and the West Bank.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Current vice president of Panama Isabel Saint Malo and former United States Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) are among a group of six professionals heading to Harvard this fall as Institute of Politics resident fellows, the IOP announced Thursday morning.
Along with Saint Malo and Flake, the fall 2019 class of fellows includes Black Votes Matter Fund co-founder LaTosha Brown, president of the Atlantic Bob Cohn, former White House Social Secretary Deesha Dyer, and CNN political commentator Alice Stewart. Each fellow will lead a study group, hold office hours, and mentor undergraduate student liaisons while living near Harvard’s campus for the semester.
IOP Fellows and Study Groups student co-chair Elijah C. DeVaughn Jr. ’21 said the diverse group of fellows was selected with a “holistic” curriculum in mind.
“We wanted to have some fellows that talked about international issues while also having fellows that talked about domestic issues,” DeVaughn said. “We too wanted a fellow that was kind of more on the comms side, the press side, provided we have an election coming up.”
Saint Malo, who concludes her term as vice president on July 1, plans to focus her study group on international issues, according to De’vaughn. He said that Saint Malo is interested in a variety of topics, including trade wars with China and U.S.-Russia relations.
“We haven’t had an international figurehead in a long time, especially one from the executive branch,” said Katherine A. Krolicki ‘20, who co-chairs the IOP Fellows and Study Groups with DeVaughn. “I think that’s going to be a really great experience.”
Flake, who visited the IOP in March to speak about bipartisan collaboration, is the only U.S. elected official among the fall residential fellows. Stewart, however, also has political experience — she served as communications director for U.S. Senator Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) during his 2016 presidential campaign.
DeVaughn said the IOP sought to have fellows with a wide range of backgrounds.
“We’re really trying to push the boundaries as to what it means to be a fellow at Harvard’s Institute of Politics,” DeVaughn said.
Dyer, for one, has followed a nontraditional path in public service. After dropping out of college and then returning to community college, she worked her way up from a White House internship to the role of social secretary in the Obama administration.
On Wednesday, Dyer launched the Black Girl 44, a scholarship for black female college students interning in Washington, D.C. The scholarship is funded by other black women who worked in the Obama White House. Dyer’s study group, entitled “Imposter to Impact,” is slated to address some of the barriers that she herself faced and aims to address with this new scholarship fund.
In addition to leading their study groups, fellows will participate in IOP programming and be available to the broader Harvard community through office hours and other events.
IOP Director Mark D. Gearan ’78 said that it is a priority for fellows to embed themselves in the University during their time as fellows.
“They come to campus and they really want to immerse themselves,” Gearan said in an interview. “To really take advantage of it, some of them audit classes, some of them attend other lectures, but also through the six student liaisons — they really move them around campus so that so many people can have access to them.”
Gearan added that, in turn, the IOP seeks to draw the broader Harvard community to the resident fellows.
“Our hope is that we do it as expansively and inclusively as possible so that they really reach various parts of campus,” he said.
