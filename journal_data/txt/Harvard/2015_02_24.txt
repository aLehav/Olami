“I don’t really like giving too much away, and that’s why all the blurbs are short and sweet,” director Garrett C. Allen ’16 says of “Stranger,” which opens in the Loeb Ex this Friday. “I think the audience should be very open when they come in.” At a rehearsal last week, Allen enthusiastically observed lead characters Linda (Elizabeth K. Leimkuhler ’15) and Hush (Dylan J. Peterson ’17) as they interacted in a particularly emotional scene. “That’s the action and energy we need,” he said. Because “Stranger” takes place inside the limited world of an airplane, this energy—according to Allen—is what will keep the play moving and the audience captivated.
The play’s synopsis is simple: Two strangers, who meet by chance on a flight across the United States, expose pieces of their past through their conversation. Hush has just been released from prison, where he became extremely religious. While flying across the country to start a new life, he meets a woman who also has a complicated past. The play examines the relationship that develops between the two over the course of a single conversation. “The play really deals with human interaction and a lot of issues of power and coping with things that have happened in our past and how we can’t really escape that,” Allen says.
Leimkuhler says that this common theme is what draws the audience into the performance. “It’s interesting to put something on a stage that the audience can perceive as relatable,” Leimkuhler says, “[even with] how wild some of the events are.”
“Stranger” runs from Feb. 27 until March 7. The four-person cast also includes Juliana N. Sass ’17 and Cole V. Edick ’17 in various supporting roles. Producers include Scout K. O'Beirne '15 and Emily E. Bergquist ’18.
Allen believes that “Stranger” will be well received by audiences. It’s “really exciting, really intense, and really psychological… Just be ready,” Allen says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the typical student, the thought of balancing a full course load with a rigorous international concert schedule may seem impossible. Then again, Karen E. Christianson '17 is not a typical student. The world-renowned organist’s talents have earned her both immense praise and invitations to perform at a number of esteemed venues, including the Notre Dame, Salzburg Cathedral, and Westminster Abbey, where she is currently the youngest soloist ever to play. This week, Christianson sat down with The Crimson to discuss her musical beginnings and aspirations.
The Harvard Crimson: How did you first become involved with the organ?
Karen E. Christianson: I’d been playing piano for a year before I started organ. I picked up the organ when I was 7 because my dad plays, and he got a tiny one for our house so he could practice. I saw the builders putting it together, piece by piece, and I saw my dad playing with his feet, which was…the coolest thing in the world as a 7-year-old. From there I asked my dad to start teaching me, and after a year, he realized that I needed a real teacher. I ended up studying with Alan Morrison at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia.
THC: Did you ever consider taking a year off to pursue music?
KC: School is my number one priority. I had considered going to music school, but I didn’t actually end up applying—I decided that wasn’t the route I wanted to take yet. I wanted to come to a place like Harvard where I could explore my interests in other disciplines and music and still keep up the organ, because there’s such a vibrant organ community here, more so than other schools.
THC: Do you think the skills you’ve picked up from playing the organ have helped you in other aspects of your life?
KC: Absolutely. A lot of what comes with playing the organ—playing any musical instrument, really—is that there’s a lot of dedication and a lot of practice hours that go into it. You have to be really committed to getting the finished product you want. It’s a lot about having a vision. You have this piece in front of you, and then you have to decide to spend this amount of hours studying it, and then you put in the time to learn the notes. And what’s more than just learning the notes is creating your own interpretation of the piece, because everyone plays it differently, depending on their own experience. A lot of my organ teachers have influences on the way that I play, and it’s kind of interesting to put together different views and kind of formulate my own interpretation.


THC: You’re the youngest person to ever play at Westminster Abbey, and the first woman to play at Eton. Do you ever feel pressured to continue on that trajectory?
KC: I think…there is pressure. Especially because there are other young organists studying really intensely at conservatories and learning a bunch of new repertoire that I don’t necessarily have enough time to devote to as they do, because that’s what they study—that’s what it says on their diploma when they graduate. Obviously I’ve had to adjust my concert and practice schedule since being here because things are more intense. But I think that I can still do it. I definitely want to continue on that trajectory because I just…love sharing music and my passion with other people.
THC: Is that what you would say is the most fulfilling part of playing the instrument?
KC: I think as I’ve gotten older, the most fulfilling part has changed for me. When I was younger, it was more the power you feel when you sit down at the organ and it’s like, “Oh, I’m making all this noise.” But now, I’ve started to realize the impact the music can have on people—seeing how music can lift people’s spirits and make people happy. The most fulfilling part is when you play a concert and then someone comes up at the end and says, “That made my day so much better. Thank you for playing for us.”
THC: How do you see yourself continuing with organ after college?
KC: I’m not really sure what I’m going to do in terms of career path. That’s why I’m exploring my interests while I still can. There may come a time when I have to decide whether I’m going to continue with science as a career. I love science research, especially biochemistry, and I know that I still want to continue performing as much as I can—it’s just a matter of if I’ll play professionally or kind of have two careers. But no matter what, I’ll still play organ.

Local performing arts non-profit World Music/CRASHarts presented Boston-based contemporary dance company Urbanity Dance’s first full program at the Institute of Contemporary Art on Feb. 20. The show’s five pieces offered an exploration of elemental forces—of light, gravity, and energy itself—while remaining rooted in human emotion, engaging with both the audience and the performance space around it.
A central idea of the show was the theme of light. “The title of the show, ‘Bend,’ refers to light—how we manipulate and see light—and that is the thread connecting [the pieces],” says Alex Lorditch, Urbanity’s chief of staff. For instance, “They fell,” the inaugural Boston performance of a collaboration between Urbanity’s founder and director, Betsi Graves, composer Ryan Edwards, and artist Jeremy Stewart, explored the interaction between light and the human body. Stewart placed an infrared camera over the stage that followed the dancers, who appeared at times to spread pools of light around their feet, at times to sweep away or magnetically attract dark particles of shadow. “The piece really became a duet between me and the lighting designer,” company dancer Brian Washburn said in a Q&A after the show.
In a similar vein, “Photo Box D,” choreographed by Andy Noble, began in darkness, with a dancer pointing a tiny flashlight at herself and illuminating short passages of motion. Floodlights in rectangular boxes then blazed into life at the back of the stage, drawing blinks and gasps from surprised spectators, who suddenly found themselves, rather than the performers, in the spotlight. The dancers moved into and out of the pools of light created by the light boxes in an attempt to draw awareness to unseen portions of the dance. The interplay between dancers and light raised a question that Lorditch describes as: “If we don’t see something happen, does it happen?”
Several other pieces addressed the physicality of dance itself and its struggle against or transcendence of weight and gravity. In “hi how r u? can u enable me 2 enable u again? k thx bye,” choreographed by Graves, dancers repeatedly built and disassembled a pyramid of their bodies. The dancers began by attempting to sit upon the shoulders of the smallest of the ensemble, who then slipped out from underneath them, until the larger male dancers sat down to form the base of the pyramid. “Ocellus,” a 1972 quartet by the American modern dance company Pilobolus, continued this exploration of weight and power: the slow, acrobatic movements of the dance, sometimes bordering on contortion, demonstrated the athleticism of control and gradual motion.
Standing in contrast to these two pieces was “(r)evolve,” choreographed by dancer Jaclyn Walsh of contemporary dance company Keigwin + Company. Where “hi how r u?” and “Ocellus” engaged with gravity, emphasizing the force required for the dancers to lift their bodies into handstands or to support other dancers on their backs, “(r)evolve” explored the bounds of the normal laws of motion. At one point, the dancers even used turning boards, plastic strips that reduce the friction between a dancer’s foot and the floor, to enable them to spin faster.
For Urbanity, the ICA itself also served as an important part of the performance. “A Boston dance group is rarely asked to perform at the ICA, and it’s a huge deal and a huge honor to be representing Boston dance,” Lorditch says. Urbanity’s performance engaged with their venue and the various genres of art housed within it in novel ways: for instance, “Photo Box D” examined the process and aesthetics of photography. “The whole conceit of [“Photo Box D”] is that all the lighting is photography equipment,” says Eleanor Regan, the company’s development director. During the piece, camera-like flashes transformed the movements of the dancers, visible to the audience for only a second at a time, into a series of still photographs. Extending the show’s conversation with other art forms, dancers in the second Graves piece became human architecture as they constructed their pyramids, and in the Pilobolus piece, dancers resembled slowly moving statues, stone or clay come to life.
But for all its academic exploration of light, movement, and space, the performance closed on a lighthearted note. As the show drew to an end, the company offered a tribute to its home city: beaming dancers leapt onto the stage to take their bows dressed in scarves, earmuffs, and woolly hats, set to the tune of the Beatles’ “Here Comes the Sun.”

Growing up and becoming an individual isn’t easy. In contrast, watching 17 poised and powerful young women sing a selection of musical theater songs celebrating those experiences was not only easy on the ears but a true delight. More than just girl power, “Getting the Girl: A Musical Revue,” which staged two back-to-back performances at the Leverett Old Library Theater on Feb. 20, spoke to the challenges of finding one’s own path, tapping into one’s creative energy, and taking charge of one’s life.
Setbacks, bruises, disappointments, missed opportunities, and worse have the potential to drag one down, but, as the music throughout “Getting the Girl” reminded the audience, each person has the choice to do something about it. “Just because you find that life's not fair, it / Doesn't mean that you just have to grin and bear it! / … / And if it's not right! / You have to put it right!” affirmed lines from “Naughty,” a song from “Matilda,” performed by Julia E. Belanoff ’18,  Zoey A. Bergstrom ’15, Madison M. Dildine ’16, and Joule P. Voelz ’17 (an active Crimson blog editor). The show’s songs were chosen because they feature women not merely pining after men; indeed, the show’s Facebook page characterized its message as “I am not someone’s someone.” The music, performed expertly, provided support, guidance, and tough love.
Although loosely structured, the production’s plot centered around the creation of a poem. Cast members gave each other directives that were lighthearted and yet reflective of the troubling thoughts that run through many girls’ minds. “Praise something that you would like to change about your body,” and “Apologize for something that you’re not sorry for” were two such suggestions. Without much dialogue, the performers were free to use their body language to convey their closeness and sisterhood. Equally importantly, the sparse dialogue allowed them to move quickly and effortlessly from song to song.
Soloists Elise M. Baranouski ’15 and Taylor K. Phillips ’15 brought the house down with their renditions of “My Strongest Suit” from “Aida” and “Don’t Rain on My Parade” from “Funny Girl,” respectively. Baranouski added spunk and flair to her performance with hair flips and upbeat dance moves, while Phillips’ soaring voice earned her uproarious applause. But it was when the cast came together that the voices mingled into something spectacular. “Where there was nothing let there be something, something made by me / There's things waiting for me to invent them / There's worlds waiting for me to explore / I am an echo of the eternal cry of / Let there be!” the entire company sang in a chills-inducing version of “The Spark of Creation” from “Children of Eden.”
When not onstage, the cast nestled together in an assortment of comfy lounge chairs and looked up affectionately at whomever was performing. The “Getting the Girl” singers made this space their own, although some arrangements worked more successfully than others. In their rendition of “Reflection” from Disney’s Mulan, Brenna K. McDuffie ’15 and Taylor L. Vandick ’16 walked into the center aisle and faced each other. Although this arrangement added visual interest to the revue, the theater’s setup made the performance difficult to see, while the poor acoustics of the space made the song challenging to hear.
With classics from “A Chorus Line” and “Hello Dolly,”  as well as a showstopping original song, “Shine,” by Elizabeth P. Kantor ’18, the revue’s setlist was ideal for musical theater fans. The sassy, reflective, and endearing show imparted a message that hit close to home: Be you, and be true; the rest will fall into place.

Sequels kill cult comedies. This is a well-established fact: “Back to the Future 2,” all the Ace Ventura sequels, and the “Hangover Part II”, among others. Much of the humor in cult films emerges from the synthesis of a thousand disparate elements, a synthesis that cannot even really be fully understood, much less replicated consistently. “Hot Tub Time Machine 2” completely fails to capture the spark of its predecessor, and its raunchy, frat-boy humor grows vile upon realization of the film’s complete lack of depth.
It is difficult to penetrate fully the abject failure of “Hot Tub Time Machine 2” without first understanding what makes the original so acceptable. “Hot Tub Time Machine” is a raunchy bro comedy about bachelor-in-perpetuity Adam Yates (John Cusack) and his friends: washed-up party animal Lou Dorchen (Rob Corddry) and mild-mannered, dog-spa grunt Nick Webber (Craig Robinson). The trio decides to take a visit to a ski-lodge they frequented in their youth, bringing Adam’s 20-something, illegitimate nephew Jacob (Clark Duke) along for the ride. The gang engages in a variety of amusing hijinks and misadventures and ultimately achieves self-discovery in the process. The film finishes with all its loose ends neatly tied up.
And then the sequel occurs. And somehow, it manages to be more phallocentric than Sylvester Stallone’s entire post-Rocky career—the entire plot is about penises. The characters are jolted out of their idyllic lives by the arrival of a mysterious assassin who shows up at Lou’s mansion and shoots him in the penis. The gang gets into the titular hot tub time machine to go to the future to stop the event from ever happening. In the future, Jacob has made a fortune by inventing a device called the DickPad. Nick has become something of an artistic joke, known primarily for the “Webber Shuffle,” a dance which consists of him tottering from foot to foot while “grabbing dicks off a tree.” The gang makes contact with Adam’s yuppie son, played by a now heavily typecast Adam Scott. Enlisting Adam, Jr., the group continues its penis-related escapades, most of which have little to do with actually discovering Lou’s murderer.
The film’s mistakes are many and glaring. First, the character of Adam Yates, Sr., is sorely missed. His absence forces once-co-stars Lou and Jacob into the protagonist slot. Unfortunately, neither of the characters, as sketched, has the emotional depth necessary to serve as the focal personality in the film. Remorseless party-animal Lou Dorchen is fine in small doses—say, as a foil to a more well-rounded Adam Yates—but as a protagonist he’s intolerable, abrasive, and shallow. Jacob proves himself to be little better, vacillating between downtrodden and submissive in the present to little more than an intensely douchey Lou clone in the future. The original film succeeded largely on the strength of the likeability of its competent cast; here, however, that same supporting cast is stretched too thin—forced to serve more complex roles without commensurate gains in character complexity.
The setting of the film, too, is lacking. The kitschy 80’s ski resort of the original film exuded plenty of charm. This film’s future, however, does not. It is sparsely populated with poorly executed futuristic clichés—Lou's reconciliation with a sentient, obnoxious, self-driving smart car serves as a large plot point—and, on the whole, is largely indistinguishable from the present. Jacob even comments on the how the future doesn’t feel that different from the “past”—a move that could come off as witty if it did not seem like an apology. The movie falls prey to this too often—it tries to be self-deprecating, but its efforts only highlight the clumsiness that characterizes it.
“Hot Tub Time Machine 2” attempts, like its predecessor, to tie everything up by the end of the film. The killer is found and then circumvented, Lou and Jacob discover the “true meaning of family,” and Nick solves his marital issues. The deeply unsatisfying final scene, however, has all the characters revert to asinine displays of the same pre-temporal-voyage-nonsense that precipitated the assassination in the first place. By the end of the film, the viewer has watched a tight-knit band of more-or-less unsympathetic caricatures dither about in a bland future, only to have their problems solved by happenstance. Any small, stunted beginnings of character growth are stamped out, and the gang returns to daily life, unchanged by the ordeal. The film is as circular as the flow of water in a grimy motel Jacuzzi and just about as likely to make you regret the way in which you have spent your last hour and a half.

Trying to appraise “I Am Radar,” Reif Larsen’s splendid second novel, in terms of plot is an exercise in futility. At first the novel may seem to be a globetrotting epic about art and science. Larsen describes the incredibly intimate lives of struggling families around the globe, ranging from white, suburban New Jerseyans learning to deal with their strange baby (the titular Radar) to Serbians being torn apart by the ethnic war that rages around them. He stutter-steps between disconnected places and timelines until he at last pulls all the strings together for the book’s grand reveal. But such a description is misleading as to what really matters in the novel. Far more than events, it is the people inhabiting its pages and the relationships they make and break that drive the book’s strong aesthetic power.
The book is divided into five sections that seem unrelated but are all part of a grand larger picture. Larsen flows between Radar’s birth and the lives of his parents before he arrived in their lives, a Serbian family in the war-torn Balkans (Radar’s paternal homeland), and Radar’s awkward early adulthood and his introduction to Kirkenesferda, a mysterious puppet troupe and band of Scandanavian scientists. There are also scenes in Indochina and the Congo. Kirkenesferda is the glue tying together these disparate parts of the novel. Through the troupe, Larsen explores the relationship between the observer and the observed and between art and the world. They give bold and innovative performances on quantum entanglement, nuclear fission, and other kinds of scientific theater, and they perform in the most horribly war-torn pockets of the globe, but their performances are mostly audience-less. Kirkenesferda is interesting and enigmatic, and it is only too bad that Larsen does not develop them more.
What truly lights up the pages of “I Am Radar” is Larsen’s delicate touch when it comes to character. Larsen’s depiction of the Serbian father Danilo, who desperately seeks to bond with his son as their family and world fall apart, is a typical example of this touch: “‘Every tradition is meant to be broken,’ said Danilo, though he was not sure—nor would he ever be—if such a thing was true.” Danilo’s difficulty in leaving “tradition” behind reflects Larsen’s talent for showing how children repeat and repeat the sins of their parents as they struggle to tear free of their past. Whether it is Danilo, or Charlene—Radar’s neuroticly destructive but well-meaning mother—or any other member of his diverse cast, Larsen’s portrayal of the human is spot on. Reasoned or cryptic, the novel’s cast pops off the page and drags the reader into their gritty lives. Even when the reality of the story strains the limits of credulity, the book remains grounded by the simple fact that the characters feel remarkably, and at times painfully, real.
What grounds “I Am Radar,” in other words, is that it is about children growing up. It is about parents struggling to understand and accept that tradition is, as it is put so eloquently by one of Larsen’s characters, “shitty rules made by shitty people.” But Larsen also shows that tradition can be hard to shrug off completely, since throughout the novel the past stretches out pallid hands to control the present. And it is not just tradition that pulls the strings in “I Am Radar”—whether people are struggling to control themselves, parents to control their children, or puppeteers to control their puppets, this theme of control echoes throughout the novel. When Larsen stays within the literal, this theme is engaging and drives many of the subplots that reside within the sections. When he goes outside of his characters and strives to make a grander metaphorical point about the nature of the world and puppetry, the result is unconvincing at best. “My dear, the mask cannot be the player, and the player cannot be the mask,” says a Kerkenesferda actor to Radar’s mother—here, it is not hard to groan inwardly at Larsen’s vague attempt to make a point.
In general the writing is at times incredibly self-aware, which leads to some charming moments and skillful displays of Larsen’s wordsmithing. Once a character quips to another, “Why do you need the author when you have the book?” The novel is littered with pictures and diagrams, for example, and from time to time it will refer to a fictional novel, “Spesielle Partikler,” that records much of the same story that Larsen himself is telling. By the end of the book, when the plot has moved past the contents of “Spesielle Partikler,” it also begins to refer back to itself. Most of the time these metafictional touches are immersive and interesting, although it can drift into the realm of sounding a little high and mighty in a book that is at its core driven not by the point it is trying to make, but by the relationships held within.
And then it ends, all too suddenly and prematurely. In sharp contrast to the middle sections about the Balkans and Cambodia, where Larsen does his best character work, the novel peters off into a quiet and disappointing finale. By this point it has managed to pick up all the pieces and set a blistering pace through the jungles of Africa as readers barrel towards the last page and Kirkenesferda’s last performance. The rushed, botched ending casts a harsh spotlight on the rest of the book because, for all the beauty of Larsen’s characters, they are left woefully adrift, many of their destinations or fate completely unknown. “I am Radar” quite simply feels 50 pages too short, as if Larsen had cut the novel off with an uncertain hand-wave.
Despite its pitfalls, this book is certainly still worth reading. Larsen crafts an evocative and distinctly weird world out of evidently extensive research. His writing drips with creativity; the characters are deep and engaging. In the shortest summation that can be mustered: “I Am Radar” is a journey that far surpasses its destination.

As whispers about the 2016 presidential nominees build to a crescendo, it’s only a matter of time before we’ve solidified our candidates for the next election. During the final stages of a presidency whose promise of hope continues to dwindle, Americans have already started to look to potential nominees to rejuvenate their trust in the power of the POTUS. But with a number of recognizable names swirling around the political stratosphere, 2016 already portends to be an uncomfortable dose of déjà vu. With Hillary Clinton and yet another Bush being cited as top contenders alongside familiar names such as Christie, Biden, Perry, and Santorum, the 2016 election appears to be a second go-round for past hopefuls, lacking in fresh faces or opinions.
What I fear most for 2016, however, isn’t the recycling of candidates. It’s the recycling of cheap party politics. As exciting as an upcoming presidential election can be, there is nothing more irksome than when concrete issues are overshadowed by the same banal banter, the same left-right divide that turns candidates into caricatures.
This is, quite often, the byproduct of partisanship. Securing right-wing voters means pitting oneself against the left, and vice versa. Senator Ted Cruz has already theorized that the 2016 presidential seat will go to a Democrat if the GOP selects a moderate candidate, and he might be right on the mark.
The need for a far-right candidate to offset the GOP’s strong liberal opponents represents a fundamental flaw in our governmental system: Candidates must often represent the extremes of their party in order to secure voter turnout in their favor. More troublesome still is the fact that this polarization shifts the focus away from the candidate, so that party identification becomes more important than individual policy. Candidates become Democrats or Republicans first, and presidential nominees second.
As a general voter, and especially as someone with a complicated political identity, it’s enough to make me disenchanted by our nation’s entire political system. That is, until I remember why candidates are stretching themselves thin trying to appeal to their target demographics. At the end of the day, basic supply and demand tells us that our position as voters is the most favorable, the most powerful, because we have what every politician wants: a vote. Instead of pointing the finger at what the political climate seems to be saying about our government, then, perhaps it’s time to consider what the political climate says about our priorities as voters.
Unfortunately, our priorities aren’t where they should be, especially when it comes to young voters. With a meager 41.2 percent youth voter turnout in the last presidential election, it’s clear that Americans aged 18-29 are dissuaded by the bureaucracy of modern politics. In a statement to USA TODAY, John Della Volpe, the polling director for the IOP, explains why: “Unfortunately what we've seen over the last several years is our young people have believed that politics doesn't have the tangible results that they wish that it did. So therefore they are less likely to be participating.”
As one of the young people to whom Della Volpe refers, I empathize with the frustration over the attacks flying from either side and the Washington egos that prevent real change from happening. When the 2016 election comes around, it will be even easier to feel jaded by what we read online or see on television.
In those times, however, we must remain hopeful that while presidential candidates may not be able to transcend the shackles of partisanship, perhaps we as voters can. Of course, doing so requires that we take our votes seriously. It requires that we demand the kind of candidate we can be proud of even in the absence of that candidate among the current slate. Most importantly, it requires that we show up to vote. After all, just because the 2016 presidential election may be a repeat performance doesn’t mean our participation at the polls should be too.

Nothing could make the case for Harvard’s divesting from fossil fuels now more forcefully and eloquently than this winter’s Boston weather. Granted, nobody knows with 100 percent certainty that global climate change caused the many weeks of snowfall and frigid temperatures. However, even those who formerly scoffed have to admit that something very strange and ominous is happening to weather patterns around the world. Climate change is no longer a problem we can pass along to our children and grandchildren; it is here now.
For anyone who wishes to understand the connection between Boston’s Snowmadeggon and global warming, I refer them to an article in the Washington Post entitled “What the massive snowfall in Boston tells us about global warming.” It has to do with warmer than usual waters in the Atlantic off New England.
The freakish New England winter has already caused billions of dollars in lost productivity, transportation shutdowns, traffic accidents, hospitalizations, snow removal, and building damage from collapsed roofs. Harvard University itself must bear some of these costs. How many more catastrophic weather events must we endure before we find the courage to act?
Two recent scientific studies underscore the urgency of divesting now. The Washington Post recently published an article entitled, “The rate of sea-level rise is ‘far worse than previously thought,’ study says.” CNN also released a news feature entitled “Risk of American 'megadroughts' for decades, NASA warns.”  Both provide a preview of the perilous climate changes caused by mankind’s unchecked bad habits.
The new chairman of the Senate’s Environment and Public Works Committee is Republican James Inhofe of Oklahoma. Inhofe has declared climate change to be the greatest hoax played on mankind.  With control of both houses in Congress, Republican climate skeptics like Inhofe will do all they can to undermine any attempts to deal with climate change for as long as they are in power.
The world counts on the U.S. to take the lead on this, the most important challenge of the 21st century.  President Obama has made bold moves to reach out to China and India in order to end the impasse between developed and developing nations on climate change strategies. With his leadership, we have taken some significant strides in addressing this issue. But he cannot do it alone and he has less than two years left in office. The forces arrayed against him are formidable. And governments—whether federal, state or local—cannot drive these changes without help from our institutions of higher learning with their intellectual and moral leadership aligned with their endowment portfolios.
Harvard is in a unique position, as the most prestigious university in the world, to lead the divestment movement. How will we explain to our children and grandchildren that, when there was still time to save the planet, we elected to do nothing? Not to decide is to decide.
Once Harvard divests from fossil fuels, many other universities and institutions will follow. How will we feel 10, 20, 50 years from now when they write the history of this era? Will Harvard be seen as a leader or a follower? Global climate change affects every person on the planet and will determine how habitable our world is for centuries. Is this cause any less important than South African apartheid, tobacco use, or discrimination against gay men and women in the military, all issues on which Harvard has taken an institutional stand in the past? At the time, those seemed like tough decisions, too. In hindsight, they appear obvious. Will we stand on the right side of history this time? What does your conscience say?
I urge you to visit the website of Divest Harvard and sign the petition, if you haven’t already. With enough pressure, I have confidence that President Faust and the Harvard Corporation will do the right thing—very soon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Inmates caused a riot last Friday at the Willacy County Correctional Center, a private federal prison in South Texas, by using pipes as weapons and starting fires in three of the prison’s 10 housing units. No prison staff or contract employees were harmed, and inmates after the event have been cooperative. Willacy County Correctional Center serves as a Criminal Alien Requirement prison—in short, a facility exclusively for illegal immigrants, who often have only committed immigration-related crimes. The American Civil Liberties Union has found that inmates in CAR prisons are “subjected to shocking abuse.”
Though we do not necessarily agree with the use of riots as a method of calling attention to issues of prisoner rights, we certainly do believe that these issues deserve more attention. This is especially true given that prisoners themselves are often stripped of rights they would otherwise use to make their voices heard. Additionally, we do not condone the privatization of any aspect of the criminal justice system; the rights and wellbeing of prisoners are particularly susceptible to being trampled in private prisons.
Private prisons are teeming with incidents of rape, rat infestations, and malnourishment. They often lack supervision and have less comprehensive security requirements than equivalent institutions run by the Federal Bureau of Prisons. CAR prisons’ immigrant detainees also have access to fewer education, work, medical care, emergency care, and drug treatment resources than prisons operated by BOP.
These are issues that too often are ignored by the general public. Given these conditions and the corresponding lack of attention, prisoners often have few methods other than riots or outside investigations to express discontent—the former might appear especially appealing when the latter fail to effect reforms. There can be no doubt that the voices of these prisoners deserve to be heard when their rights are being compromised, regardless of the means.
Moreover, private prisons benefit from their inmates’ displeasure as overcrowding their facilities helps bring in a profit. Between 1990 and 2009, inmate populations in prisons grew 17 times their size, in step with drastic rises in revenues for major private-prison firms; by 2009, revenue for the largest firm had reached $1.7 billion.
The deportable community is especially susceptible to this exploitation. As the most rapidly growing constituency of inmates in America, illegal immigrants have been particularly lucrative for the private prisons. In fact, the richest of these private prison firms even announced that “leniency in conviction or parole standards” would hurt its business model. This perhaps explains why inmates at Willacy County Correctional Center describe the prison as having “severely crowded and squalid living conditions.”
Though private prison firms claim that they are a more cost-efficient alternative to state-run prisons, data does not support this conviction; in fact, private prisons may actually be more expensive. In short, there is no real need for private prisons, and the relatively unregulated nature and undisputedly appalling conditions of these facilities is a further strike against the privatization of the criminal justice system.
We do not condone prison riots, but the events in Texas have called to attention that the nature of private prisons and the conditions to which they subject their inmate population, most notably illegal immigrants, are abhorrent and must be addressed.

Former Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 will speak at Harvard’s 364th Commencement on May 28, the University announced on Monday.
Patrick will address graduates and their families during the Afternoon Exercises of Commencement, which will take place in Tercentenary Theatre in Harvard Yard. The first African American to serve as governor of the Commonwealth, Patrick was first elected in 2006 and led the state for two terms, choosing not to seek re-election in 2014. Patrick now serves as a visiting fellow at MIT.
“Deval Patrick is an extraordinarily distinguished alumnus, a deeply dedicated public servant, and an inspiring embodiment of the American dream,” University President Drew G. Faust said in a statement. “We greatly look forward to welcoming him home to Harvard on Commencement Day.”
During his governorship, Patrick was known for education initiatives such as winning a federal Race to the Top education grant, implementing the state’s 2006 health care reform program, enacted by his predecessor Mitt Romney, and revamping the state’s transportation system, which created the Massachusetts Department of Transportation. During his tenure, he handled several crises, including the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing and subsequent manhunt for the suspects.
Prior to his governorship, Patrick worked as an attorney at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, was a partner at Boston law firm Hill & Barlow, and served as assistant attorney general for civil rights under President Bill Clinton. Patrick studied at both the College and Harvard Law School, where he was president of the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau.
Patrick has delivered remarks at Harvard several times in the past, promoting careers in public service at the Kennedy School of Government and talking with students at study groups in the Institute of Politics.
Recent Commencement speakers include former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg and media mogul Oprah Winfrey.

UPDATED: February 23, 2015, at 9:25 p.m.
The Harvard University Police Department is working to address an “uptick in package thefts” as it observes an increase in reports of missing items, particularly at graduate apartment-style housing, according to HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano.
“We are constantly looking for any sort of trends or hotspots in criminal behavior, and it appears over the last several months, and probably going out almost a year, that there’s been an uptick in package thefts,” Catalano said in an interview earlier this month.
Brigid O’Rourke, a University spokesperson, added in an email that Cambridge and the Boston area more broadly have “experienced increases in misdeliveries and package thefts” as online shopping has increased in recent years. “Harvard’s campus services has been monitoring a similar increase in the rate of misdeliveries and thefts of packages delivered directly by the [United States Postal Service] and other delivery services to residents in Harvard-owned apartment buildings,” she wrote.
According to Catalano, items recently reported missing have ranged in value, but many have been expensive or high-end. According to HUPD police logs, on Feb. 2, an officer was dispatched to take a report of a stolen package containing a Loro Piana jacket valued at $5,540 at McArthur Hall in Allston. On Feb. 18, packages collectively containing just under $1,000 worth of goods were reportedly stolen at Soldiers Field Park Apartments, also in Allston.
“[Thieves] are looking for pricy garments or things of high value,” Catalano said. Still, he added, “we’ve had everything stolen.”
Notably, a majority of these thefts have occurred at graduate apartment-style housing, he said. Mail processing and distribution is handled differently at Harvard-owned apartments than at undergraduate housing.
To address the issue, HUPD is in communication with Harvard Real Estate Services property management staff, according to Catalano.
“We are trying to work with University officials to eliminate the opportunity for that theft by securing the packages either at a secure location or have some sort of monitor so that we can remove these packages out of the lobbies of buildings, which are becoming an attractive target for theft,” Catalano said.
Although the majority of missing packages are from graduate student housing, missing packages are a concern among undergraduates as well. Winnie Wu ’16, a Lowell House resident, said she lost a package earlier this semester before she picked it up.
Still, according to Leverett House building manager Paul J. Hegarty, in his House—the largest among the upperclassman dorms—only two to three packages had gone missing this year as of mid-last week.

Harvard Dorm Crew has begun using a new cleaning fluid safe enough to drink yet powerful enough to clean in some undergraduate residencies.
The cleaning fluids, manufactured by EcoLogic Solutions, are 99.9 percent water. Instead of containing typical chemicals that can be harmful when ingested, the products are largely composed of saltwater that has undergone electrolysis to give it strong detergent and disinfectant properties.
Dorm Crew and Facilities Maintenance Office personnel alike have begun to utilize the chemicals in some locations in the Houses and in the Yard as part of a pilot program launched last December.
The Electrical Chemical Activation products that Harvard has begun using are as effective as or more effective than traditional cleaning products and have been previously used in industrial roles, according to EcoLogic spokesperson Jake Robertson.
“Efficacy is one of our top priorities because if the products aren’t effective they wouldn’t be competitive with the more traditional offerings,” he said. “[These products are] currently being used in Amtrak facilities to wipe diesel sludge off their cars.”
According to EcoLogic’s website, purchasers of their technology can simply install an EcoLogic machine on site, which allows them to continuously produce more cleaning product by combining a few basic ingredients and allowing the machine to perform the necessary electrolysis.
Harvard’s EcoLogic machine is located in the basement of Straus Hall, where the fluid is produced.
EcoLogic Solutions, founded by CEO Anselm Doering in his apartment in 2005, has grown into a company that now produces over 100 cleaning products, all of which are “green,” according to the company’s website.
Prior to the introduction of the new products, Dorm Crew captains were afforded the opportunity to meet with a representative from EcoLogic to discuss the benefits of the new products and instructions for best use.
Paul L. Belmonte ’10, a Dorm Crew supervisor, stressed the importance of sustainability in the cleaning efforts of Dorm Crew and the Facilities Maintenance Office.
“FMO has been Green Seal certified since 2011, a prestigious certification in the cleaning industry which means, in a nutshell, that we uphold sustainable cleaning practices that are friendly to the environment and human health,” Belmonte said.
Belmonte also explained that the national cleaning industry is moving towards more sustainable practices in general.
“The cleaning industry has been trending green for several years, which means we’ve had an increasingly wide variety of green cleaning products to look at,” he said.
The use of the EcoLogic chemicals across College residences will depend upon the results of the current trial period, Belmonte said.
Robertson, the EcoLogic spokesperson, expressed hope that partnership with Harvard could help accelerate the expansion of EcoLogic’s new sustainable products.
“If we’re able to show that this technology works for Harvard, it could be the tipping point for other universities using it,” he said. “We’re hoping to make it work and incite change, starting in Harvard Yard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Winthrop House and Currier House will be providing students with free off-site storage for this summer due to construction projects that will limit storage space traditionally offered on-site.
Winthrop has arranged free limited off-site storage for the next three summers due to construction in preparation for House renewal in 2016-2017, Building Manager Britta Wierich wrote in an email to Winthrop affiliates this month.
Harvard will be doing “extensive” advanced construction work—such as replacing windows and chimneys—and thus will be unable to offer on-site summer storage this year. In past years, Winthrop has offered summer storage for students in its basement and attics.
Winthrop House Committee Co-Chair Marlee A. Ehrlich ’16 characterized both her response and the general student response to the announcement as mostly positive. She said that because summer storage had been “a concern in other houses,” some Winthrop students were relieved and excited that free summer storage had been arranged for them.
“I’m glad [administrators] are thinking of us,” Ehrlich said. The details of the arrangements had not been shared with Winthrop residents, she added.
Students in Quincy House’s recently renovated Stone Hall expressed frustration last spring over the lack of free on-campus summer storage.
Currier will also offer its residents free off-site storage this summer for similar reasons.
As the House expands its gym into what is currently a store room, it will offer its residents space at the Quadrangle Recreational Athletic Center to house their furniture for at least the next two years, Currier building manager Manuel J. Casillas wrote in an email to Currier this month.
According to Currier House Administrator Patricia G. Pepper, both House administrators and House Committee members were involved in the decision. In addition to the renovation of the gym—which is unrelated to House renewal—Currier has also recently created a “relaxation room” stocked with comfortable chairs, similar to that in Pforzheimer House, for its students.
Neither House has announced whether free off-site storage will be offered past the next several years.

In the wake of winter weather that shut down University operations on three separate days this semester, some Harvard Square businesses have experienced a downturn in sales and customer traffic this season. Business owners pointed to recent MBTA service suspensions as well as parking and travel bans as factors inhibiting employees and customers from travelling to the Square.
“Businesses have reported that it has been very difficult these last few weeks with the snow,” said Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association.
Donez J. Cardullo, co-owner of Cardullo’s Gourmet Shoppe, echoed Jillson’s sentiment.
“We’ve had days where we’ve just had zeros on the books, so we are definitely behind business-wise this year,” Cardullo said.
Restaurant Flat Patties reported a similar decline, with its earnings down 10 to 12 percent compared to those of the same period last year, according to Thomas J. Brush, the owner of Flat Patties and Felipe’s.
Concerned for their employees’ safety while traveling to work with MBTA service suspended, some local businesses closed, resulting in an above average number of closings this season.
“Historically, Cardullo’s does not close,” Cardullo said. “But with the fact that the T keeps closing and that’s how my staff gets to work, it is impossible for me to stay open.”
In addition, Mary D. Taylor, owner of Salt & Olive, said the parking ban, which ended last week, discouraged customers from travelling to and patronizing the Square.
“People are just not venturing out as much,” Taylor said. “The parking situation is a definite hindrance... Since the garages are totally full, if there are no metered spaces, there is no way to get traffic into the Square.”
However, for the few local stores and restaurants that did remain open leading up to the storms, winter storms marked a short-term bump in profits as customers stocked up on supplies.
“When there is a big storm being predicted, we [get] a lot of people coming in to buy beer, wine, cheese, and crackers—items to hunker down with,” Cardullo said.
Brush indicated that on the days with the worst weather, finding ways to bring in employees has resulted in high traffic.
“Even when the T was shut down, we picked up our employees and brought them in to stay open,” Brush said. “There were so few options out there on those days, and you still have a fairly large population of students and people living in or around the square, so there was a steady stream of business, practically non-stop.”
However, although small bumps in business preceding a storm have been beneficial, the winter weather has mostly had a negative impact, Cardullo said.
Business owners say they are hopeful that the worst of winter weather has passed.
“A lot of people have cabin fever. Business will absolutely come back,” Taylor said. “Once it gets over 20 degrees, people will be happy to go outside again.”

Quorum, a startup founded by Harvard undergraduates Alexander A. Wirth ’15 and Jonathan A. Marks ’15, has gained national attention for combining a congressional database with a set of analytical tools in order to evaluate actions of individual members of Congress.
According to Marks, Quorum is built to answer one main question. “Can we algorithmically or computationally identify the ways that people are working together in Congress and use this information to design better legislative strategies?” he said.
Quorum’s name comes from the word for the minimum number of legislators required to be present before business can legally be conducted, Marks said.
Wirth and Marks first met during a Harvard First-Year Outdoor Program trip prior to their freshman year and eventually became blockmates. They came up with the idea for a tool that would allow those involved in formulating policy to easily track the actions and relationships among members of Congress in their dorm room in Mather House.
Wirth and Marks further developed their start-up in ES95r: “Startup R & D,” taught by lecturer Paul B. Bottino, who is also the executive director of Technology and Entrepreneurship Center at Harvard. According to Marks, Bottino’s guidance in the class and his continued mentorship has been extremely important to the growth of Quorum.
In addition to support from Harvard faculty, Quorum has received financial support from other Harvard resources as well. The cofounders were able to hire four additional full-time employees for the duration of the summer of 2014 after winning the McKinley Family Grant for Innovation and Leadership in Social Enterprise of the 2014 Harvard Innovation Challenge and receiving the Institute of Politics’ Gov 2.0 grant.
Quorum officially launched last month to the public. Wirth and Marks continue to work with the Harvard Innovation Lab to develop media contacts and relationships with future clients, Marks said.
Steven M. Kekacs ’16 joined the Quorum staff as a full-time employee over the summer and said that the season was a critical period of time for the company’s development. “We had nothing at the beginning of the summer, and then we just built these features, built this product from the ground up,” he said.

UPDATED: February 24, 2015, at 3:29 a.m.
After University President Drew G. Faust referred the discussion of news that researchers had photographed thousands of students last year without their knowledge to an electronic oversight committee, that body is discussing the broad implications related to privacy and expects to report back to her by the end of the term.
At last November’s meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Computer Science professor and now Interim Dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Harry R. Lewis ’68 asked a question on behalf of two of his colleagues who he said had claimed that their spring 2014 classes were secretly photographed. Vice Provost for Advances in Learning Peter K. Bol confirmed that he authorized the study and later informed thousands of students that they were photographed.
“The committee has not been charged with investigating or reporting on the attendance study,” the chair of the group, Harvard Law School professor John C. P. Goldberg, wrote in an email last month. He added that the “study served as a springboard for general discussions among committee members about privacy interests that may be at stake when classrooms are observed.”
Goldberg’s committee was formed after a recommendation from a task force convened in the wake of revelations that College administrators had secretly searched the email accounts of resident deans after the Government 1310 cheating scandal of 2012.
The Goldberg committee met in October and December to discuss general policy implications of the attendance study, rather than retrospectively investigating the incident, and will continue to meet in the spring, Goldberg said.
The committee is charged with reporting back to Faust about the ways Harvard has been overseeing the implementation of its electronic information policy, according to Goldberg. Faust said some report will be made available to the wider public after the committee presents its findings to her.
Faust said that while members of the committee decided the attendance study did not explicitly fall under the purview of the group’s charter, she hopes to learn more about how the University can keep up with what she described as a changing state of privacy.
“I guess we began to understand in the context of the email controversy that with all the things one can do with cameras and computers and so forth, privacy is so much in transformation [and] that we would be facing real scrutiny of ourselves about how to handle these issues,” Faust said.
Other members of the committee include English professor Amanda Claybaugh, Harvard Business School’s Executive Dean for Administration Angela Q. Crispi, the School of Public Health’s Executive Dean for Administration Michael Kan, Computer Science professor Greg Morrisett, and Harvard Medical School professor Barbara J. McNeil.

UPDATED: February 24, 2015, at 12:23 a.m.
BOSTON—Entering Monday, Jerry York had yet to finish last at the annual Beanpot Tournament over the course of his 21-year tenure as head coach of the Boston College men’s ice hockey team.
On the other end of the spectrum, Harvard took the ice on Monday having brought up the rear in 11 of the 20 latest iterations of the annual tournament. In the consolation game of a Beanpot that has been anything but traditional, history held serve, as the No. 9/10 Eagles (19-10-3, 10-6-1 Hockey East) skated away with a 3-2 come-from-behind victory at TD Garden.
After heavy snow postponed the second round of the tournament from Feb. 9, Monday’s contest marked the latest Beanpot game to be played since 1978. So naturally, BC took control of the game with a storm of its own.
After generating just 10 shots on target in the first two periods, the Eagles came alive with 17 in the final frame and overtime. Following an equalizer from sophomore forward Matthew Gaudreau midway through the third period that tied the game at two, BC sent the No. 16/15 Crimson (14-10-3, 10-7-3 ECAC) packing 1:16 into the extra frame.
Looking to make something happen behind the Harvard net, Eagle senior forward Destry Straight spotted sophomore forward Ryan Fitzgerald alone by the left pipe. After being denied by the post on his first attempt, Fitzgerald collected his own rebound and forced a shot past junior goaltender Steve Michalek to hand the Crimson its second overtime loss of the tournament.
“I really didn’t have any issue with our effort,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “I thought we played very well and had plenty of chances, [but we] needed to be able to score to put them away…. [The Eagles] hung in there, they made the big saves when they had to, and obviously they were able to get the game-winner.”
For the Crimson, it was as though Groundhog Day had been postponed as far into February as the game itself. The contest followed practically the same script as Harvard’s Beanpot opener—a 4-3 overtime loss to Boston University—beginning with a pair of goals for sophomore forwards Alex Kerfoot and Sean Malone in the second period.
After BC was whistled for boarding, one of seven Eagles’ penalties on the night, Kerfoot took advantage. Creeping up the slot upon receiving a pass from junior defenseman Desmond Bergin, the forward utilized some skillful stick work to avoid his defender and ripped a shot over BC goaltender Thatcher Demko’s right blocker to even the score.
“Harvard played with the puck an awful lot early, [and] part of it was because we took a lot of undisciplined penalties,” York said. “Our penalty killers play a lot of five-on-five shifts, so they were just worn down by those situations.”
Less than two minutes later, Malone gave his side its first lead of the evening, batting a pass from junior forward Jimmy Vesey out of the air and into the back of the net. With the score, the Crimson finished with as many goals (two) in the middle frame as the Eagles did shots.
But the similarities between the two contests did not end there, as Harvard watched its lead vanish midway through the third period. When BC junior defenseman Teddy Doherty rocketed a shot on net, for a brief moment it appeared as though the Crimson might go off-script, as sophomore defenseman Victor Newell came up with the stop of the game, covering for a scrambling Michalek in the heart of the crease.
But following the shot block, the puck made its way back to the point, where Eagles sophomore defenseman Steve Santini fired it right back at the junior netminder. Michalek made the initial save, but Doherty got his stick on the rebound, enabling the puck to make its way to Gaudreau, who tapped home the equalizer.
Michalek, who won the Eberly Award for recording the highest save percentage of the tournament, stopped 24 of the 27 shots that came his way on the night, bringing his Beanpot save total on the year to 87. But for the second time in as many tries, the junior found himself on the losing end of the contest.
Although neither side was playing for a trophy, the consolation matchup carried significant postseason implications. The loss dropped Harvard into a tie for 17th in the Pairwise rankings, creating a major obstacle for the team in its quest for an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament.
“I think our players understood the importance of the game with the Pairwise,” Donato said. “We had already played Boston College earlier in the season, but obviously they’re a team that’s amongst the teams under consideration, as are we.”
“[The contest] has a huge impact,” York added. “This [was] a big jockey-positioning game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past weekend, Harvard freshman Geordie Enoch entered the pool with just six collegiate swim meets under her belt and exited an Ancient Eight champion.
The Crimson hosted this year’s Ivy League Championship meet, where the freshman sensation earned a first place finish in the 200 individual medley, despite re-aggravating a quadricep injury in the preliminary round of the race on the meet’s first day.
Unphased, she continued to take first in the 400 IM and third third in the 200breaststroke. In addition, Enoch chipped in to help the Crimson earn two third-place finishes in relay events, the 200 and 800 freestyle relays. The performance earned the Odenton, Md. native the title of High Point Swimmer of the Meet.
Enoch earned the Crimson its first gold medal of the night in the 200 IM. Her preliminary time of 2:00.90 was the fastest of all qualifying times for the event, and she proceeded to best that mark with a finish of 2:00.66 in the final race.
“I tried to remember that all of my teammates were behind me,” Enoch said. “That gives you a certain confidence, and you don’t have some of those doubts that you have going into the morning race.”
On Friday, Enoch showed her grit by fighting through injury to claim first place in the 400 medley, besting the next closest competitor, Yale’s Sydney Hirschi, by nearly a full second.
She also improved on her preliminary time for the event by over three seconds, the greatest difference of any swimmer who finished amongthe top eight.
Despite Enoch’s fast times and high finishes, the efforts from the Harvard team was not enough to claim the Frank Keefe Trophy for the second consecutive year.
The title would in fact return to the Princeton Tigers, who tallied 1423 points over the weekend, just enough to beat out the Crimson, who scored 1401.5 points of its own to finish in second.
Yale rounded out the top three by finishing third, replicating its finish in the HYP meet last month. Enoch shined in that meet as well, winning in the 200 IM with a time of 2:04.10.
And while every race proved to be close competition, Enoch earned top-three placements during all three of the meet’s days.
“[The meet] can be emotionally taxing by the end of the third day,” said Harvard coach Stephanie Wriede Morawski ’92. “It is an exhausting event—three days is a long meet.”
Enoch did all that she could for the Crimson, including setting personal bests in both the 200 and 400 individual medleys. She also set another personal record in the 200 breaststroke.
“[Geordie] has a big presence on the team that everyone recognizes,” junior Danielle Lee said of her teammate. “She’s definitely gained a lot of confidence and has learned to race at her best. We help her, we support her, we push her up, and she does the same for us.”
Enoch is part of a freshman class that had shown great promise for the future of the Crimson swimming team in their first seasons. Fellow rookie Kristina Li took second behind Lee in the 100 yard backstroke while freshman Gabby Sims finished tenth in the 50 free and fifth in the 100 free, posting two personal records at the meet.
As the team moves forward, Lee said that there is little doubt that Enoch will play a crucial role for the Crimson in the coming years.
Enoch, who was a two-time All-American in the 200 IM in high school (setting school and league records in the event), has stood out all year long, roaring out of the gates during a standout freshman season.
Enoch started the year by finishing second with Li in a 200 medley relay, winning her first IM meet the next week in Harvard’s 215-85 win over Columbia. Two weeks later, she concluded her first semester by making the event finals at the Texas Invitational.
“We’re awestruck every time she’s in the water,” Lee said. “Coming out of high school, it can be hard to start at this level. She’s definitely coming into her own.”

For the most part Harvard house listservs are pretty tame. Aside from publicizing open houses or tracking the movements of a neighborhood Turkey, emails lists aren’t usually interesting or personal.
However, over the past month students have used Quincy Open to lodge highly entertaining complaints about everything from loud music to incessant ball bouncing. Is this too lowbrow for a house-wide email list or is this exactly why these lists exist in the first place? We’ve listed some choice messages below to help you decide.
Email Thread 1: Subject Line: please turn music off in dhall?  
Message: I can't figure out which laptop it's coming from, or else I would have walked up to your table and asked politely, but I think someone might not have their earphones in?
I'd appreciate it if you could please turn your music off or at least the volume down. I understand we don't have class tomorrow (editors note: this was the night before a snowday) but a lot of us are trying to use this time to catch up on work/work on their thesis.
Thanks!
Email Thread 2: Subject Line: bouncing ball
Currently fourth floor new quincy, someone above is bouncing a ball constantly like once per second. Please stop? I can't fall asleep.
Re: bouncing ball
On a similar note, third floor new quincy, there's been lots of door banging (hard to tell if it's above or on the same floor). Please be consciousness when closing, especially in the evening.
Thanks a bunch.
Re: bouncing ball
This morning someone on the 6th floor (facing Dewolfe street) someone was bouncing the ball at 8 am this morning - and does it a bunch during the day.
PLEASE STOP.
The Master and Quincy Community above you and on the side of you.
(this one was signed by Co-Master of Quincy House Deborah Gehrke)
Email Thread  3: Subject Line: TOO MUCH SOAP!
too much detergent in washer 16 of stone hall! I'm worried about your clothes.

But you’ll be thankful for these classes once the midterms roll around -- yes, it’s midterm season already! Aren’t you glad you used all those long weekends and snow days for studying?
IN THE ATMOSPHERE
Sick of the cold? Well that’s too bad. Today we will be experiencing frigid highs of 19 degrees and chilly lows of 13 degrees. At least it’s not snowing, right? Until this weekend, that is.

ON FLYBY
1) 8 Simple Steps to Achieve SnapFame: Having trouble getting yourself on the Harvard Campus Story? Take our advice!
IN THE NEWS
1) Deval Patrick Named 2015 Commencement Speaker: “Former Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 will speak at Harvard’s 364th Commencement on May 28, the University announced on Monday.”
2) Harvard Makes Final Touches on Sexual Assault Climate Survey: “After January pre-testing, Harvard is making final touches on its sexual assault climate survey and—given that similar surveys have historically drawn lackluster response rates—plans to heavily publicize it before rolling it out in April.”
3) Melting Snow Prompts Writing Center to Relocate Offices: “After a series of winter storms, water damage to the Barker Center basement caused by melting ice and snow has prompted the Harvard College Writing Center to relocate its offices temporarily.”
4) Asian American Students Discuss Intersectionality at Conference: “The Harvard-Radcliffe Asian American Association hosted the East Coast Asian American Student Union annual conference this weekend, the largest Asian American student conference in the United States with over 1,200 students participating this year.”
IN THE ARTS
1) ‘Fifty Shades’ Monochromatic: “If ‘Fifty Shades of Grey’ were only half its current length, it might actually be a decent laugh for people who are good at entertaining themselves. Unfortunately, the film as it is right now is for the most part two hours of boredom with unbelievable characters and a repetitive, predictable plot. More painful than anything that the characters have done in this film is the thought that it is only the first movie of a trilogy.”
2) Hear Me Out: ‘The Blacker the Berry’: ““The Blacker the Berry,” then, is not only a well-composed track dealing with a significant societal ill—it is also uniquely intelligent. If this and “i” are an accurate representation of the album to come, Lamar’s third release may even surpass the considerable success of “good kid, m.A.A.d. city.”

Heads up, Class of 2016– Junior Parents' Weekend is just a few days away! While it’s always nice to spend time with family (and have a nice meal paid for, obviously), this parent's weekend won’t be quite as easy to get through as when you were a freshman. After all, you’re a junior in college now, which means you’re expected to have your life together...well, at least a little. Here are a couple of tips to help you impress Mom and Dad.
1. Clean Your Room  You might be 21 now, but the empty handle of Rubinoff and scattered beer cans in your common room trashcan need to go. But let’s be honest– besides taking out the trash, does anyone have time to clean up for real? You’ll probably end up kicking as much of your stuff under your bed/into your closet the hour before they arrive on campus and then avoiding your dorm like the plague, anyway.
2. Do LaundryEven if you’ve still got a few pairs of clean socks left. Because nothing says “You pay $60k a year for me to skip all of my lectures” like the overwhelming odor of dirty clothes and apathy that’s taken over your bedroom. And no, just emptying an entire bottle of Febreeze into the air doesn’t count.
3. Have Something to Say About Your Summer/FutureAnd if you don’t, then just mumble something obscure but impressive-sounding enough that they can brag to your relatives about it. People on campus may be freaking out about interview season, but try and not let the stress of not knowing (slash not hearing back about funding yet...I’m looking at you, OCS) get in the way of enjoying your parents’ company.
4. Have Plans For ThemParents loooove events. It’s just a fact. If you have stuff for them to do once they’re on campus, they’ll love you for it. (Especially if those things are super “Harvard,” because they’re still incredibly proud of you and want to feel like they’re a part of it.) Anyway, you’re probably already being inundated with Facebook invites to improv shows, a capella jams, very important famous people giving speeches, and networking events, so you might as well suggest a few of the more interesting ones.

For 30 years, the Harvard Foundation has been inviting artists to preside over Cultural Rhythms, a series of student performances celebrating the diversity of Harvard’s student body. To honor her work in television, film, and philanthropy, Cultural Rhythms named Eva Longoria its 2015 Artist of the Year. Although a sudden blizzard cut Longoria’s visit short, the atmosphere inside Sanders Theater on Feb. 21 proved so warm and welcoming that several gracious people were willing to answer this Roving Reporter’s questions.
Robert Rush ’18, audience member
Roving Reporter: Suppose I say to you: I don’t think Eva Longoria is all that attractive. Am I (a) blind or (b) lying?
Robert: I would say (c), you’re lying to yourself. She’s a very beautiful woman. But [it’s] more than her…looks[.] I think that when you’ve accomplished so much, especially…in positions where you’re not really represented [or] usually marginalized—for her to have the influence that she’s had in terms of TV and philanthropy, and [to be] a spokesperson for not only her race but for where she came from…shows a deeper level of beauty.
Abdurezak Shemsu ’18, audience member
RR: Who should be next year’s Artist of the Year?
Abdurezak: A lot of names pop up, but I don’t know what would make them Artist of the Year.
RR: Maybe they just pull names out of a hat?
Abdurezak: They pull names out of a hat? Kevin Hart.
Nworah B. Ayogu ’10, Adams House resident tutor, audience member
RR: Have you been to Cultural Rhythms before?
Nworah: I have—I think six times? Seven.
RR: What’s different this time?
Nworah: The groups are…amazing every year, but there’s just a slightly higher level of energy.… I think even within the groups, they’re that much more diverse. [Mariachi Veritas] was amazing, [like] that [soloist] from Kentucky who switches from Spanish to his thick Kentucky accent in a couple minutes.
RR: A lot of people came to see their friends perform. Did you know anyone up there?
Nworah: I actually have a bunch of my students from Adams House whom I’ve seen in different acts. I’m there cheering for them, screaming my head off and being extremely proud and really amazed at just how talented they all are.
Devika P. Gupta, parent, audience member
RR: Why did you decide to come to Cultural Rhythms?
Devika: My daughter’s one of the organizers. But I also wanted to come because it’s just so representative of diversity, and that’s awesome.
RR: What’s your favorite thing you’ve seen so far?
Devika: I loved the hip-hop. Then I saw the mariachi band. Especially when you see children from different cultures performing the art of another culture, my heart is overcome. It’s incredible.
Amanda P. Flores ’18, audience member
RR: Who should be the 2016 Artist of the Year?
Amanda: Salvador Dali.
Ciara L. Adkins ’16, performer, KeyChange
RR: So it’s snowing outside, howling winds, zero degrees–part of you must have wanted to camp out in your room instead of going to practice.
Ciara: It’s cold and everything, but then I tell myself what great friends I’ve made and how much I enjoy the music.… I would never stay in my room versus hang out with KeyChange.
Thomas R. Lively ’18, performer, Taekwondo Club
RR: Do you ever look out at the audience and think, “Wow, how many people would be watching if I tripped and fell right now?”
Thomas: Yeah, about three hours before the show I start thinking about that, and I never stop.
Govind S. Bindra ’18, performer, Bhangra
RR: Do you guys rehearse with the other acts?
Govind: Bhangra rehearses only with the other Bhangra members. It’s kind of hard to coordinate with the other groups…as much as we would love to do that.
RR: How frustrated are you that Ms. Longoria got Artist of the Year instead of you?
Govind: You know, I’m going to have to give it to Ms. Longoria. She’s an amazing human being. I think she definitely deserved it, with her work and humanitarian efforts. I’ll give it to her this time.
