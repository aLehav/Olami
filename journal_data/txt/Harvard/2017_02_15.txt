After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The most concise summary of Viet Thanh Nguyen’s excellent new short story collection, “The Refugees,” is offered by one of its narrators: “[W]hile some people are haunted by the dead, others are haunted by the living.” In “The Refugees,” memories are tactile and the shadows of interrupted lives ever-present; even the smallest details in Nguyen’s stories are imbued with the bittersweetness of unspoken what-might-have-beens. As he did in the Pulitzer Prize-winning “The Sympathizer”—itself also a story of the Vietnamese diaspora—Nguyen conveys the trauma and lingering melancholy of displacement in a way that feels deeply honest yet still wonderfully imaginative.
Memory is the defining theme of “The Refugees.” Sometimes the memories are painfully physical: In “Black-Eyed Women,” the ghost of the narrator’s long-dead brother shows up on her doorstep, still wearing the clothes in which he boarded a rickety refugee vessel. The connection between memories and ghosts is repeated several times; dead or missing loved ones flit endlessly on the peripheries of Nguyen’s characters’ lives, occasionally stepping forward into the light. In “I’d Love You to Want Me,” an aging professor with dementia begins to believe that his wife is a former lover named Yen, his accidental disclosures tracing the outlines of a life previously hidden. The reader—as well as the professor’s wife—knows Yen only through the professor’s offhand comments about her, but as the world recedes from him she alone remains. The story is an understatedly devastating reflection on duty, regret, and the power of the unspoken, ideas that underpin much of “The Refugees.”
Nguyen, once a refugee himself, considers the Vietnamese diaspora through a wide lens. His stories’ protagonists include a black American veteran and a Mexican American transplant recipient in L.A. His characters experience exodus and its aftermath in a range of ways: some are transfixed by the traumas they witness, while others find unexpected opportunity, even liberation. “The Other Man” is the story of Liem, a young man who leaves Saigon in the chaos of the Vietnam War’s last days and winds up in San Francisco, where he finds tolerance and even acceptance as a gay man. And yet even Liem feels torn between two worlds, and profoundly guilty because of it: In Vietnam, his family is struggling through re-education, land confiscation, heavy censorship, and repression. In each of the stories that make up “The Refugees,” there are whispers of lives left unlived, simultaneously very distant and omnipresent, trajectories that only shocking changes in fate could have disrupted.
Nguyen’s characters are all aware of this tension. In “Fatherland,” Mr. Ly returns from a five-year stint in a New Economic Zone to find that his wife, after discovering his infidelity, has disappeared to America with his three children; his response is to remarry, have three more children, and name them after the first ones. The children in Vietnam grow up hearing sporadic news of their namesake half-siblings’ successes in America and eventually realize that their father would rather be there—that he feels he was deprived of the life that should have been his. Nguyen has a remarkable eye for detail that allows him to cast every image with real emotional force, from Mr. Ly’s carefully laminated stack of photographs in the living room to the way his shirt, a size too small, strains shabbily across his stomach. Whether in Vietnam or in America, many of the characters in “The Refugees” share the forlornness particular to those subjected first to great tragedy and then to the banality of colorless lives.
That tragedy looms large throughout “The Refugees”: Although none of the stories deal directly with the war, and only a few with the brutality of the boat journey, the scattered glimpses of the traumas suffered by the Vietnamese—refugees and non-refugees alike—are all the more devastating as a result. In these scenes, Nguyen’s writing is lyrical and searingly evocative without slipping into voyeurism or sensationalism; the protagonist of “Black-Eyed Women” speaks of seeing “the smoldering tip of God’s cigarette, poised in the heavens the moment before it was pressed against my skin.” Like Nguyen’s ghosts, the tragedy of the war is always there in the background, coming in and out of focus but never abating—take for example a young taxi driver in Ho Chi Minh City who cannot bring himself to call it that, despite the fact that the city was renamed before he was even born. Even in the stories set most closely to the present day, and even for characters who do not remember the war, past losses murmur.
Memory, in Nguyen’s telling, is the material of the bonds connecting not only past and present but also homeland and foreign, life lived and the life that was once possible, and all the fragments of a divided and contradictory identity. But, like continental plates floating away from one another, those fragments of identity drift constantly farther apart; the generation that stood with one foot in each land is no longer the majority of the diaspora, and Nguyen recognizes the challenges that will result. In “Fatherland,” Mr. Ly’s eldest daughter returns to Vietnam, where she feels alienated not only from the father who is a stranger to her but also from the country she does not recognize. “Can you love someone you don’t remember? Can you love someone you don’t know?” she asks. The searching, candid way in which “The Refugees” examines that question makes it an essential read for anyone seeking to understand the immigrant experience, while Nguyen’s writing—as polished and powerful as it was in “The Sympathizer”—confirms the author’s place among today’s most compelling literary voices.

President Trump’s executive order on Jan. 27, which proposed legislation severely restricting the movement of Muslim immigrants and Syrian refugees into the United States, moved Ariana L. Chaivaranon ’18 to action.
“After the Executive Order came out, I couldn’t sleep, and I was really anxious to start making work. I was frustrated that it felt like the arts community on campus wasn’t being very responsive or mobile,” Chaivaranon said.  “I thought it would be good to get the conversation rolling in terms of what you need to be thinking about if you’re going to be making work like this and some different approaches you can bring to making politically influenced work.”
Chaivaranon, a painter herself, decided to organize an “Art for Human Rights Teach-In” at The Signet Society on Feb.11. The event’s stated goals included discussing possible courses of action for artists both within Harvard and in the broader contemporary political climate, connecting opportunities for interventionist art with interested participants, and generating ideas and momentum for future interventions.
Amelia Spinney, a teaching fellow in Harvard’s VES department, offered a wheat-pasting demonstration. The technique is particularly relevant for artistic intervention due to its common use for adhering paper material to walls. JR, for example, is a well-known French photographer who uses wheat-pasting to post black-and-white photos, sometimes politically-charged, in public sites.
Spinney commented on a recent surge in the production of art dealing with politics. “I think that a lot of people are realizing that they themselves as individuals care about politics all of a sudden, in a way that maybe they did not on an individual level before,” she said. “Art is so personal and so intimate, and I think that that’s why we’re seeing this creative awakening right now.”
Chaivaranon also expressed the sense of duty that she sees for artists working today. “I think as a mechanism of culture, art is inherently entangled in the sociopolitical issues and dramas of the time and that artists have a mandate to be—I don’t want to say ‘political’ with the work, because I think that word has a lot of strong connotations, but relevant work does speak to some kind of issue within the contemporary cultural sphere,” she said. “And right now it feels like politics is everywhere in America and in the broader international context as well, and so I think that it’s up to artists to be making work that engages these really pressing questions.”
Both Spinney and Chaivaranon spoke to the specific advantages that the visual arts have as a political medium. “I think it can be a powerful way to respond to politics just like it’s a powerful way to respond to almost anything. I think of art almost as a language in its own right, like a whole other way of communicating in a powerful way,” Spinney said.
Chaivaranon solicited Harvard professors, teaching fellows, art historians, museum staff, and other members of the local arts community for the Teach-In. In addition to Spinney, speakers at the event included Keith Hartwig, a student at the Graduate School of Design who works on art and architecture promoting civic participation and dialogue, Tania Bruguera, a Cuban dissident and performance and installation artist, Sean Palfrey ’67, Adams House Faculty Dean and photographer, and Cécile Guédon, a lecturer in Harvard’s Department of Comparative Literature.
Speakers offered different ideas, discussion points, and specific projects for audience members to become more politically engaged with local and wider arts scene. “I think people should express their art in all sorts of ways and allow it to infiltrate all corners of their life,” Palfrey said, after speaking at the Teach-In. “People should express their basic values in their lives and advocate for things that are important to them. If art and values overlap, celebrate the combination!”
Chaivaranon commented on the importance and possible advantages of engaging with forms of interventionist art right on Harvard’s campus. “I think as Harvard students we have a lot of privilege, in that sometimes it’s easier to get heard here than it is for other people who don’t have the same kind of platform,” she said. “I think that this site is a good place to start in terms of making work that can send a message about the way that students feel about these kinds of issues. I don’t want to speak for all students, but I think it’s important to publicly voice discontent when you feel that.”
Audience members at the Teach-In shared enthusiastic feedback from the event. “Ariana did a great job organizing the Signet Teach-In and bringing wonderful, passionate artists from around the community,” Charlie S. Krumholz ’18, who attended the event, said in an email. “The Teach-In provided a special opportunity to transform passions, ideas, and solidarity into real change. As a Harvard Art Museums Student Guide and painter, I left inspired by the Teach-In with a few of my own ideas, and am sure others felt similarly.”
Chaivaranon herself felt that the afternoon proved a step in the right direction. “I think the event was really successful in getting people thinking and getting a start,” she said. “But I think the important thing is that it is just a start, and the momentum and energy generated at this event needs to be channelled effectively into actual interventions and productions. This is really about generating a sustained trajectory of resistance and keeping up the energy with this kind of production.”

Nothing builds perseverance faster than pushing a speed sled loaded with nearly twice your body weight. Nothing molds your attitude towards your fellow man quite like carrying him a few hundred yards on your back. Nothing disciplines you as firmly as being up to see the sunrise more days out of the week than not. Adversity is instrumental in instructing courage and perseverance, but what we do when nothing is on the line and no one is watching is equally as important in shaping character. Choices matter, and character is nothing more than choices.
Who would claim otherwise? We definitely recognize instances of good and bad character. That said, how much do we really care about the roots and creation of this character? Assessing character briefly became a matter of utmost national importance (or non-importance, perhaps) in this election season, but woefully little attention is paid to the act of building character. In a society that generally prefers quantification, action items, assessment and evaluation, creating character is seen as a moving target and vague abstraction better left alone. Treating character in this way, however, is exceptionally dangerous to a self-governing society.
As Lawrence Reed, President of the Foundation for Economic Education, argues, liberty demands high character. If we are to self-govern, we must govern ourselves. In other words, if we are to effectively operate a system in which authority and power are vested in elected representatives, then elected and electors alike must strive to reflect the highest caliber of character. As our Founding Fathers understood, freedom itself is preserved by the good character of all. Washington bid farewell to young America with the injunction that “virtue or morality is a necessary spring of popular government.”
Yet the building of character seems to be a non-priority to the institution that should be doing the most for it: the modern university. Historically, the stated missions of universities have sought, in so many words, to produce principled leaders of sound moral fiber. Florida State University compiled a list of current, explicitly character-driven university mission statements, and the list’s brevity is concerning. Character is no small task, and there is more room for failure than success.
Perhaps some part of failure comes in the form of collectivism. Don’t get me wrong; it is well and good that universities and their organizations seek to promote community and inclusion. A few of these groups are very deliberate in building character and molding leaders, and are explicitly committed to individual growth. Athletic communities are built upon the idea that better people make better athletes, religious organizations seek to deepen personal connections to faith, and volunteering and community service groups rely upon individuals with upstanding character to do the work they do.
Unfortunately, campus rhetoric is often oriented completely differently. Many groups arrange themselves according to a label game in which they understand who a student is by looking at their ethnicity, race, socioeconomic background, religion, sexuality, etc., ad nauseam. We play along, habitually placing ourselves in the taxonomy with sentences that start, “As a [insert income status] [insert sexuality] [insert gender identity] [insert ethnicity] from [insert geographical location], I feel…” I don’t deny that some of these things can significantly influence our worldview or that our backgrounds can have a huge impact on our lives. But deep within those labels are our choices.
Membership in a particular group in the identity taxonomy is not at all an accurate measure of who an individual is. Few people would deny this, but few are willing to delve deeper than the labels to examine choices within them. After all, collective identity markers are categorical variables, easy to examine with statistics and address with policies. Of course the modern university, with the unenviable task of trying to please a student body that is never pleased, would also orient their rhetoric and actions along concrete and tangible variables to try to keep as many students as happy as they can.
This might leave us in a logically untenable position, holding that the university is in the wrong for failing to develop character, yet conceding that it cannot in fact do so. So what the institution ultimately cannot do, we must do ourselves. Collegiate groups that aim to build character can lead a student to the waters of truth, but we choose whether to scoop it up in our hands and drink.
Character is not created by external circumstance. Circumstances can reveal and inform character, but only individual choices create it. We demand a great deal from our universities, but we should also demand a great deal from ourselves beyond academic achievement, resume-building, networking: beyond success. For if we obtain all these things without developing strong character, then we have obtained nothing.
A coach or drill sergeant can motivate, threaten, and inspire you, sometimes all in the same sentence, but only you can move that sled or finish those push-ups. You may be instructed in the pursuit of truth, and educated in the fundamentals of leadership, but your actions remain in your hands alone.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past Saturday, Yale University President Peter Salovey announced that Yale University would rename Calhoun College—one of its 12 undergraduate residential colleges, which are analogous to Harvard’s houses—after the groundbreaking computer scientist Grace Murray Hopper, who studied at Yale in the 1930s. This overturns the decision made by Salovey in April of last year that Yale would not change the name of the college, which was met with student outcry, and to which we objected at the time.
We commend Yale on the care with which the change was contemplated and subsequently announced. It is evident the decision was not taken lightly; in August, Salovey formed a “Committee to Establish Principles on Renaming”,  and thereafter another committee to apply the principles established by the committee to the intricacies of Calhoun College. This second committee eventually led to the recently announced decision by Salovey and Yale’s board of trustees. Moreover, an alternate namesake was already determined at the time of the announcement, so that students did not have to undergo a confusing period  of uncertainty—an uncertainty that Harvard students are all too familiar with after the nearly three month lag between the renunciation of  “house master” and adoption of  “faculty dean”.  Peer institutions would do well to pay heed to the way this sensitive decision was made.
Even though we agree with this decision, we do not endorse wholesale revisionism by universities, nor do we believe institutions should do themselves and their students a disservice by effacing a less than agreeable past. Renaming is an inherently ad hoc process, and universities must take into account the particularities of any situation in arriving at decisions. That said, Yale has made the correct decision in renaming Calhoun College after Grace Murray Hopper.
As bears repetition, John C. Calhoun was an avid anti-abolitionist and secessionist, as well as an advocate of the constitutionally dubious policy of nullification. In the eloquent words of Salovey,  “John C. Calhoun’s legacy as a white supremacist and a national leader who passionately promoted slavery as a ‘positive good’ fundamentally conflicts with Yale’s mission and values”. This in itself should disqualify him from being the namesake of a college that is intended to serve as a cornerstone of students’ identity at Yale.
By contrast, Grace Murray Hopper was a trailblazing pioneer and brilliant scientist to whom modern programmers are still indebted. After receiving a master’s degree from Yale in 1930 and a Ph.D. four years thereafter, Hopper served in the Navy during World War II, subsequently creating the first computer compiler in 1952 and contributing to the development of the programming language COBOL. Hopper’s illustrious achievements eventually earned the moniker “Amazing Grace”.
It is beyond debate that Hopper is a more deserving namesake than Calhoun. By virtue of Yale’s willingness to scrutinize its previous decisions, we hope current Yale students—and those 100 years hence—will be able to take pride in being members of Hopper College.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Alleged Ponzi schemer and “Pharma Bro” Martin Shkreli might have less than 6 months of freedom left. In between appearing before a Congressional committee to testify about price-gouging consumers of life-saving drugs and attending his own trial for securities fraud, he is set to spend some of that time delivering a talk about investment strategies to eager undergrads here at Harvard.
Shkreli’s Harvard connections are slight. He has a B.A. from Baruch College and worked at “Mad Money” Jim Cramer’s ’77 hedge fund. He soon went off on his own, starting hedge funds premised on short selling biotech stocks. Most notoriously, he served as the CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, where he purchased the rights to daraprim, a drug used by AIDS and cancer patients to fight parasitic infections, and jacked up its price from $13.50 to $750 per pill, an astronomical 44-fold increase.
So what brings him to Harvard? Shkreli accepted a misguided invitation from Harvard Financial Analysts Club to discuss “his experience in financial investing.” In their desperation to hold a big event, the club has only succeeded in hosting someone antithetical to their mission. HFAC’s publicity stunt aims to capitalize on the notoriety of Shkreli’s name. Shkreli’s attention-seeking, it turns out, is rivaled only by HFAC’s.
In an industry that chemist and Science blogger Derek Lowe argues tends to shirk attention to avoid press scrutiny of lax regulation, Shkreli has succeeded in making news. For instance, just as his pharmaceutical scandal was gaining national attention, he bought an unheard, vintage Wu-Tang Clan record for $2 million. For Shkreli, it seems that that old maxim is true: all press is good press.
This is not to say that I oppose Shkreli’s presence at Harvard per se. A free exchange of ideas on campus is healthy for any discourse, even (perhaps especially) ones that broach topics or opinions that offend us. Free discourse guarantees him the same right to speak that it does student protesters to protest him. I am not opposed to speakers who challenge our views being given a forum here; plenty of speakers do that. I’m opposed to this particular speaker being given this particular forum.
HFAC claims to provide “the Harvard student body with sound financial education programs and real-world investment experience.” What the club is really doing by inviting a man known for little more than allegedly swindling investors and price gouging AIDS patients is offering a lesson in deception.
In an interview last Tuesday with The Crimson, Shkreli said, “I am here to give a speech about investing. It’s not going to be controversial.” If HFAC were truly interested in presenting a figure with investing experience, they could do better than invite a man recently charged with securities fraud. They could find someone better than a caricature of corporate greed, the arrogant “Pharma Bro.” This invitation only serves to contribute to the false stereotype that Wall Street is a haven for the crooked.
Moreover, as HFAC notes on its Facebook page for the event, Shkreli will not field questions about his pending court case or his outsize personal life, the two things that actually make his story intriguing today. What’s left looks to be some crude compilation of stock tips from a disgraced trader. If Shkreli shares personal investment strategies, attendees are probably better off doing the opposite.
Students are smart enough to know what’s going on here. They aren't foolish.  Undergrads are not attending the event expecting to be taught the principles of ethical investing. They know that Mr. Shkreli is not an icon or an idol, but, because we are captivated by notoriety far more than expertise, we are drawn to him nevertheless.
To a large degree, HFAC has already gotten what it wants. The event has made the pages of papers like the Boston Globe and the New York Post and networks like ABC and Fox News. Hundreds of students are set to show up. Shkreli, always the attention-seeker, is probably happy to draw such a large crowd.
The real tragedy of the night will be how casually HFAC abandons its integrity. As the group sacrifices its mission to make news, perhaps they will take some comfort in knowing that crowds of students will be there to watch.

Out with the yogurt, in with the juice: Pinkberry has vacated its Harvard Square location to make way for Pressed Juicery, a California-based cold-pressed juice bar.
Pinkberry, an international franchise, originally opened its 1380 Mass. Ave. location in April 2011.
Pressed Juicery, which operates numerous locations on the West Coast, plans to move into the Square in late spring 2017. Pressed Juicery CEO and co-founder Hayden Slater said the company has been eyeing a Harvard Square location since March. The Square branch will be the chain’s third Boston-area location.
“There’s no question that Harvard Square is an integral part of Cambridge, and we’re very excited about the mix of like-minded businesses and overall accessibility and visibility in this location,” Slater wrote in an emailed statement. “We’re excited to add a healthy, convenient and affordable option for busy commuters, students and everyone in between.”
Slater wrote that Pressed’s cold-pressed juices will start at $6.50.
Pinkberry’s closure follows the shuttering of Yogurtland, another Square frozen yogurt chain that closed in 2015 just two years after it opened.
In January, Denise A. Jillson, Executive Director of the Harvard Square Business Association, called Pinkberry’s closure an example of how national and international chains—despite local concerns—do not always out-compete independent businesses.
“Pinkberry is a national account, it's frozen yogurt, and again, when they first came, they were knocking it right out of the park,” Jillson said. “And then, the novelty went away, and now they're going to be replaced. But BerryLine's still here.”
Juliana C. Rogoff ’20 said she was unconcerned by Pinkberry’s departure.
“The only real frozen yogurt [in Cambridge] is at BerryLine. I have lived here my entire life, all right, and there was no fro-yo until BerryLine,” Rogoff said. “It is so annoying whenever someone’s like ‘Hey, do you want to get fro-yo?’ and you say ‘Yes,’ then they’re like ‘Meet me at Pinkberry’. That is not fro-yo, and it angers me.”
Pinkberry did not respond to requests for comment.
Henna Hundal ’19, on the other hand, said she was disappointed about Pinkberry’s closure. Hundal would often buy fresh fruit cups at Pinkberry, an offering she worries about finding elsewhere.
“The good thing is that at Pinkberry you could go and specifically request a fruit cup,” Hundal said. “I find that it’s really hard to come by mangos and blueberries and raspberries in the Square, and that was a really convenient option for me to grab a cup and go.”
Pressed Juicery will be the Square's second specialty juice store, joining Liquiteria, which opened in 2015. The store will offer a variety of juices as well as a soft-serve treat made from fruits, vegetables, and nuts.
“When our doors open, we welcome everyone to come in, sample as many products as they like and ask questions,” Slater wrote. “Our hope is to become a resource and convenient option for anyone looking to incorporate nutritious products into their routines.”
Alexandra M. Dobbins ’20, said she was never a big Pinkberry fan, but is excited that Pressed Juicery is coming to Harvard Square.
“I was never overwhelmed by Pinkberry, especially because it is so expensive, but when I heard you say ‘pressed juices’ I absolutely jumped at that,” Dobbins said. “I think it will add a nice, new kind of hip vibe to the Square.”

Twenty-six members of the Undergraduate Council, including UC President Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 and Vice President Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18, signed a letter admonishing Datamatch’s restrictive gender choices.
Datamatch, a matchmaking algorithm created by the Harvard Computer Society for Valentine’s Day, forced students to choose “male” or “female” without offering options for genderqueer or gender non-conforming students. The algorithm’s website this year, however, allowed students to elaborate on their gender identity in a text box, but only after selecting one of the two genders provided.
Javier Cuan-Martinez ’18, co-President of HCS, apologized at the UC’s general meeting on Sunday, telling representatives that HCS regretted offending students.
“I, on behalf of the Harvard Computer Society and on Datamatch, take full responsibility for the exclusion that we have created on campus,” Cuan-Martinez said at the meeting.
Adams House representative and the UC’s BGLTQ+ Caucus Chair Nicholas P. Whittaker ’19 presented a letter further criticizing the Computer Society and what he characterized as an exclusive algorithm.
“I’m proposing an undersigned letter, a statement of support with the gender non-conforming and gender queer community after Datamatch implicitly excluded them from the experience,” Whittaker said on Sunday. “The idea of it being romantic does not necessitate the idea that it be stuck upon strict gender bearings.”
Whittaker also suggested to Cuan-Martinez that Datamatch eliminate all references to gender and become a strictly platonic service.
On Tuesday, Whittaker sent the letter to Adams House and emphasized that the UC as a body did not sign the letter, but rather individual members.
The letter, while empathetic to HCS, implored the group to improve Datamatch’s gender options going forward.
“We acknowledge that the Datamatch team has put in a great deal of work to crafting this event, and we understand that there are technical difficulties which have, in part, led to this situation,” the letter reads. “However, we believe that the values of this College are important enough to merit full attention, and urge Datamatch to take the necessary steps to ensure that this never happens again.”
According to the letter, the UC plans to work with Datamatch’s team going forward to ensure a more inclusive platform.
“It is our job to ensure that Datamatch remains accountable, and we promise to make sure that Datamatch 2018 includes all identities,” it reads.
The UC partly funds food provided to students participating in Datamatch from several Harvard Square establishments. While the Council has yet to vote on subsidizing Datamatch year, Whittaker said future funding may cease if Datamatch doesn’t abide by the letter’s demands.
“I do intend to push that next year Datamatch won’t receive funding if they don't improve,” Whittaker said Tuesday. “I've been in talks with the [UC’s] Student Initiatives Committee as to making that a reality, perhaps attaching it as a requirement to their funding for this year.”
This year, 4,924 Harvard undergraduates signed in to Datamatch.

Weeks after the Harvard Management Company announced its intent to lay off nearly half of its 230-person staff, three of the firm’s investment managers will leave the company to form their own hedge funds, according to Bloomberg.
Two of the three managers, Michele Toscani and Graig Fantuzzi, will partner to create a new firm while the third, Sanjiv Bhatia, will form his own. All three are portfolio managers at HMC. Toscani and Fantuzzi both manage fixed income assets, while Bhatia focuses on “emerging market stocks.”
HMC spokesperson Emily Guadagnoli declined to comment on the departure of the three managers.
The managers’ departure comes on the heels of an announcement in late January that the firm is overhauling its unique investment strategy and closing the bulk of its internal investment teams. In his January message, HMC’s new CEO N. P. Narvekar outlined a five-year plan to improve the University's lagging endowment returns.
In fiscal year 2016,  Harvard posted a negative 2 percent return on its investments. The returns, coupled with other financial flows like the $1.7 billion HMC allocated to Harvard’s annual operating budget in FY 2016, dropped the value of the endowment by approximately $2 billion.
Other staffers at HMC are expected to form new funds after they leave the firm. According to Narvekar, HMC’s successful real estate team will spin off to form a its own fund and possibly continue to manage Harvard’s real estate assets. According to experts, in many cases, the University would pay more for external managers than it does for its internal managers, but some predict that the real estate team might strike a deal with Harvard that mitigates the cost.

Like many Harvard faculty members, History and Literature lecturer Timothy P. McCarthy ’93 lines the walls of his office with towering stacks of books. But propped up against the window of his closet-sized Quincy House office is something more unusual: a sign touting UNITE HERE Local 26, the union that represents Harvard’s dining hall workers.
When the workers engaged in a three week-long strike in October, McCarthy was holding that sign on the picket lines. He’s been agitating for social justice causes since he first arrived at Harvard as an undergraduate in 1989.
As both a citizen and a scholar—he co-teaches “Culture and Belief 49: American Protest Literature from Tom Paine to Tupac”—activism has been a part of McCarthy’s “whole adult life,” he said. But McCarthy said this puts him in the minority among his colleagues.
“I always laugh whenever there’s kind of a caricature of Harvard as a kind of hotbed of faculty radicalism, you know the Kremlin on the Charles, and Harvard is filled with all of these radical insurgent revolutionary thinkers who don’t respect authority and the status quo and institutions and so on,” he said.
McCarthy laughed. “That has not been my experience.”
While Harvard faculty may not be the radical cohort some imagine, McCarthy and other professors say they have noticed growing activist engagement among the faculty. Recently, faculty members have been involved in advocating for undocumented students and other marginalized groups following the election of President Donald Trump.
“I have definitely noticed recently in the last year or so a growing chorus of critique and activism among a broader range of faculty members, which I welcome with open arms,” McCarthy said.
While many of Harvard’s professors still prefer the lectern over the loudspeaker, in the age of Trump, a growing number of faculty members are signing petitions and joining protests.
'The Usual Suspects'
For John Stauffer, an English and African and African-American Studies professor who teaches “Culture and Belief 49” with McCarthy, activism is more of an intellectual pursuit.
“I’m not on the front lines in a walk,” he said. “I’m more interested in analyzing and understanding what leads to a position.” Stauffer said he believes that many of his colleagues feel the same way.
McCarthy said a small cohort of professors are regularly inclined to protest, though. He calls them “the usual suspects.”
For that small group, protests are a way to push for change at an institution that tends to tread cautiously on political issues.
One of the “usual suspects” is Kennedy School lecturer Richard Parker, who has advocated for Harvard’s divestment from fossil fuels and against the manufacture of Harvard-brand goods by sweatshops. Parker said he believes activism has influenced Harvard’s history in a positive way.
“Go look at the way in which modern Harvard was created, which was out of the so-called Unitarian revolt of the beginning of the 19th century or look at the protests that swept through Harvard in the 1930s over public policy issues or in the 1960s, the 1970s and they’ve all had an impact on the University,” he said.
Parker said he is not worried about consequences for speaking out against the administration’s policies. McCarthy echoed this, although with a caveat.
“I’ve never felt that an explicit encouragement to remain silent from anyone here at Harvard and no one’s ever written to me and said to me and said you can’t say this,” he said.  “I would say that there are certain people here who are probably not happy with the fact that I sometimes will be vocal about things in the world including certain policies that Harvard has implemented or certain positions that Harvard has taken or not taken.”
McCarthy said he had once had a dean question whether the outspoken professor must speak at “every rally.”
“I said I wouldn’t have to if more people would,” he said.
Indeed, a small minority of faculty have often been the most involved in activism, and unsurprisingly—according to Organismic and Evolutionary Biology Department chair Elena M. Kramer— most come from the Social Sciences and Arts and Humanities divisions.
It is frequently non-STEM professors who take to the microphone at Faculty meetings to critique administrative policies, draft petitions, or discuss heated political issues in the classroom. Kramer attributed the varying levels of activism to “different cultures in those departments” and geographic distance from undergraduates.
“Those departments are more integrated into the Yard and the College,” Kramer said in an interview from her office in the Biology Labs, one of the northernmost sectors of campus. “Because of that, they have a closer connection and investment in the undergraduate College.”
Dean of FAS Michael D. Smith, a current professor in SEAS, agreed that the topics discussed in STEM field usually aren’t accompanied with fierce political debate.
“I’ve learned a lot from listening to my students over time,” Smith said. “Engineering is not all that political sometimes, but it can be.”
'A Different World'
While political activism among Harvard’s faculty has historically been muted, movements and events including the dining workers’ strike, the January Women’s March, and Trump’s executive order on immigration have lit a fire in many faculty who have previously remained silent.
“More people are engaged, more people are involved,” Parker said. “It is not the case that 50 percent of the faculty or something are willing to march, I don’t think even 20 percent might march, but for sure more active than the past.”
Activism among faculty members takes different forms. Petitions and letters remain efficient and common methods of protest for faculty members on a variety of topics from campus issues like the protection of undocumented students and the dining workers strike to Trump’s executive order.
“I’ve signed many petitions in the past months. I’ve been a huge petition-signer. I’m a huge fan of petitions and it's also just logistically easy,” Stauffer said.
Sometimes, though, faculty members engage in more overt methods of activism on and off campus. Suzanne P. Blier, an Art and Architecture and African and African American studies professor, can be found alongside Cambridge residents at weekly City Council meetings, fighting to preserve historical structures like the Out of Town News Kiosk and Abbot Building, which houses the world’s Only Curious George Store.
“I came to this in part through last year’s primary. I had not been that active politically before then,” Blier said of her political efforts. “I, like many others, came to realize that all politics is local.”
Following Trump’s executive order on immigration, Economics department chair David I. Laibson ’88 encouraged his students to attend a Copley Square protest if they felt strongly about the issue.
While more faculty members continue to step outside of Harvard’s halls to engage in controversial political debates, administrators have remained comparatively less vocal in their response to national issues.
Following Trump’s executive order, Smith emailed Faculty to “reinforce a deep commitment to our unique community of scholars.”
“I think reasonable parties can disagree on values and we should have those debates and universities look to be a place where freedom of expression and those sorts of debates can take place," Smith said. “But when it’s directly is impacting our mission that’s one of the things we definitely feel we can say.”
Smith, as well as University President Drew G. Faust and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana issued statements following Trump’s recent immigration ban. For Parker, this is a sign of Trump’s impact on activism at Harvard.
“When you have the president of the University and the dean of the Kennedy School both issuing public statements, expressing concern about rejection of the truth and the integrity of university values, that’s a different world from the election of Obama or even George W. Bush or Ronald Reagan,” he said.
Activism Meets Academics
In some Harvard classrooms, real-world activism has seeped into the curriculum, reshaping the role of professors from one of an educator to a mentor in activism.
In the heat of the dining workers strike, McCarthy participated with his students in a “walk-out” to support the striking workers. Students were not required to walk out and Stauffer stayed behind to teach those who chose not to.
“I’m mindful of the fact that not everyone around here agrees with me or has the same world view or lives by the same values and that we are a diverse community that has to respect each other, because of and for those differences.” McCarthy said.
Blier, a co-author of the petition to protect undocumented students, said she believes professors should encourage their students to get involved in politics.
“It’s really important as professors, for those who are interested in this piece, to get students involved,” she said. “I have strongly encouraged my students, particularly graduate students, to get involved in national and international issues related to our fields.”
Smith said that while activist professors are entitled to their personal opinions, they should be careful of how they present themselves in the classroom.
“When we walk into the classroom, we’re objective about the materials we’re presenting,” he said. “We need to be open to differing opinions in the classroom.”
But for McCarthy, the age of Trump demands that the longstanding separation between activism and academics be reconsidered.
“I think we have to resist the kinds of compartmentalizations that academics are so famous for,” McCarthy said. “We have to think more interdisciplinarily, more intersectionally, more comprehensively about just what we’re up against and what we can do to help address the injustices that are rising before us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A team of researchers led by Professors Michael J. Aziz and Roy G. Gordon of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences has developed an exceptionally long-lasting “redox flow” battery that has the potential to radically improve energy storage.
Eugene Beh ’09, a postdoctoral fellow who worked on the project, said that if the battery ran continuously, it would take six years to lose 50 percent of its capacity.
Unlike solid lithium ion batteries in laptops and other everyday appliances, redox flow batteries harness energy from chemical reactants dissolved in liquid. Aziz and Gordon’s new design, which uses water as a solvent, is longer-lasting and safer than previously designed redox flow batteries.
Gordon said the rise of wind and solar energy has elevated the importance of energy storage capacity. Redox flow batteries, he said, have much higher capacities than lithium batteries.
“The electricity that’s coming through the grid has a very short shelf life—less than a second—so it actually has to be balanced between the generation and the use,” Gordon said.
Beh said that at “99.9989 percent per cycle,” the battery’s “retention rate” outperformed other lithium and flow batteries.
Gordon said his team at SEAS had previously developed scalable redox flow batteries using strong acids and bases as solvents instead of water, but these solvents heighten the risks of the batteries.
“We think reducing the hazard is a really important part of planning for any new technology, particularly one that is intended for large-scale use,” said Gordon.
Gordon said many existing redox flow batteries currently on the market dissolve reactants in vanadium, an element that exists in very limited quantities, and cannot be mass produced.
Beh  said the use of water as a solvent constituted a breakthrough in flow battery design because water is nonflammable and has a high heat capacity, which greatly reduces the life cycle of other batteries. Additionally, because water is easily accessible and inexpensive, the team’s new flow battery can be produced for public use at a reduced cost.
Rebecca L. Gracia ’18, a Mechanical Engineering concentrator who worked on Aziz and Gordon’s team, said being involved with the project was “a really great learning experience.”
“I honestly wouldn’t have ever expected to be this young and be a part of a published scientific paper for renewable energy, so it’s really rewarding,” Gracia said.
Though  Gordon said the team had been speaking to “start-up companies” and “large companies already in this business,” commercialization of the battery is still a work in progress.
“We’re hoping that it will be a key enabler for companies to actually make large batteries along these lines,” Gordon said. “I’m optimistic because this is a technology that is really needed.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Experts spoke about the intersection of public infrastructure and labor at a Law School panel Tuesday, emphasizing the need to invest more federal dollars in infrastructure projects.
The event, called “Infrastructure: Labor, Social, Political, and Economic issues,” was sponsored by both the Harvard Trade Union and the Labor and Worklife Program and featured a panel of four speakers, all with backgrounds in infrastructure policy.
Panelists said many public works projects in the United States are in decline, and that infrastructure spending peaked many decades ago. Brent Brooker, secretary-treasurer of pro-union group North America’s Building Trades Unions, said that at least 60,000 bridges across the country are “structurally deficient.” Brooker also criticized conditions of many American highways, which he said have been neglected by the government and are often congested, leading to wasted automobile fuel.
Larry W. Beeferman, director of the Pensions and Capital Stewardship Project at the Law School, began the event by describing intersections between labor and infrastructure policy. Beeferman said that before the United States invests more in infrastructure, it should consider whether or not the projects will create well-paying jobs with good working conditions that will benefit labor unions.
Towards the end of the event, panelist Kevin DeGood, who organizes infrastructure policy proposals at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, said that for most Americans, investing in infrastructure is not seen as worthwhile.
DeGood said he hopes to change citizens’ minds about the power of infrastructure, and show that many projects are “a historical legacy.”
“You inherited facilities that other people had the courage to build,” he said.
DeGood added that he thinks prospects for progress in infrastructure investments and labor unions will be slim President Donald Trump’s administration. Throughout his campaign, Trump was critical of unions, once confronting a union leader on Twitter and implying that unions often weaken American businesses. In December, Trump nominated restaurant mogul Andrew Puzder, a vocal opponent of unions, to head the U.S. Department of Labor.
“This administration and the Republican Congress are extremely hostile to the labor movement,” DeGood said. “It’s probably the largest political target in their minds, so they will do absolutely everything they can do diminish the capacity and strength of their unions.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 15, 2017 at 8:39 p.m.
Supermarket conglomerate Stop & Shop has proposed constructing up to 1,000 housing units about a mile away from Harvard’s science and engineering complex in Allston, prompting concerns from residents about potential demographic changes in the neighborhood.
Stop & Shop submitted a letter of intent to the Boston Planning and Development Agency Feb. 10 detailing its plans to redevelop the existing Stop & Shop retail center at 60 Everett Street. This multiple-phase project would be one of the largest housing developments in Boston, and the BPDA will review the proposal.
Located off of the Massachusetts Turnpike in Allston-Brighton, Stop & Shop has owned the plot for almost 20 years. The supermarket chain’s preliminary filing demonstrates an interest in developing the neighborhood.
The intent letter outlined guiding principles for the construction plans, referring specifically to a set of recommendations from 2012 that neighborhood residents, local officials and city planners created.  The study recommended creating open spaces, constructing taller buildings along the Mass. Pike, and building a mix of residential, commercial, and cultural institutions.
In addition to “a new state-of-the-art grocery store,” the initial stage of construction will include approximately 360 residential units, parking, and a 25,000 square foot public open space.
Later stages would include building up to 650 additional residential units, as well as more commercial and office space. To support these developments, the plans also include new vehicular, bicycle, pedestrian travel paths.
According to Stop & Shop, their development plans would align with Boston Mayor Martin Walsh’s Boston 2030 goals, which includes the construction of 53,000 new housing units.
Some Allston residents, though, said they are concerned about developments like the Stop & Shop construction could affect the neighborhood.
Residents said they would like to see more owner-occupied housing in Allston-Brighton.
“If this is built for rental units, then this project will not permit people to grow roots in the neighborhood,” said Brighton resident Eva Webster. “Allston is not a revolving door.”
A 2015 US Census report showed that only 17.5 percent of housing units in Allston-Brighton were occupied by owners, as opposed to renters.
Allston resident Elizabeth Breadon said she believes that Harvard’s science and engineering complex, which is also under construction, will influence who lives in Allston in the future.
“The building of the Harvard engineering complex will bring the demand for housing for sure,” she said. “But at the same time, I’d like to see housing for families for people who will be working there—it’s not going to be all single twenty-year-olds.”
In the letter of intent, Guy Stutz, vice president of real estate at Stop & Shop, wrote that Stop & Shop will work with residents during the development.
“In the coming months, Stop & Shop looks forward to continue working with key stakeholders, abutters, the community, City officials and staff to review the plans for the Project, which aims to serve as a gathering place for the Allston community,” Stutz wrote.
The submission of the letter initiates the BPDA’s Large Project Review, an intensive process that considers how large-scale developments will fit into the “existing urban fabric” of a neighborhood.
Despite some concerns, Breadon and Webster said they are excited about the potential neighborhood benefits.
“We definitely look forward to the more green space as part of this project,” Webster said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the weekend, the Harvard men’s and women’s fencing teams traveled to Philadelphia to compete in the Ivy League Round Robins, the annual tournament that determines team championships for the Ancient Eight schools.
Neither of the Crimson squads returned to Cambridge with an Ivy title, however. That result marked a special disappointment for the women’s team, which earned a share of last year’s title after a 5-1 performance.
Women’s Fencing
In 2016, the Harvard women’s fencing squad finished in a three-way tie for the league title. That result seemed to bode well for 2017, but this year’s trip to Penn’s Tse Ping & Cheng Cheung Ling Sports Center hardly yielded the same success.
Instead, the Ivy Round Robins ended in disappointment for the No. 7 Crimson, who completed the two-day event with a team record of 3-3, alone at the middle of the seven-school field.
“We had hopes to repeat the awesome performance we had last year,” Yamin said. “The Ivy League is such a competitive group...composed of Olympians, national champions, [and] world team members…. The first day didn’t have a great start, and it was tough to gain the momentum back.”
Early Saturday competition saw Harvard dig into a quick 0-2 team record hole, with defeats at the hands of eventual champion Princeton, by a 17-10 count, and the third-place finisher Quakers, by a 15-12 tally.
The Tigers, which swept away the Ivy competition with a 6-0 team record over the weekend, beat their Crimson counterparts across all three weapons, and even the Harvard saber group led by co-captain Adrienee Jarocki fell by a 5-4 count. Over the Crimson’s other five matches, the saber group had a winning record in each of them.
Similar to previous years, Jarocki dominated her Ivy League opponents, finishing with 15 bout victories, which was the third most across all weapons for both men and women. Her plus-44 touch indicator was at the top of the women’s saber pack as well.
“Even though the overall result wasn’t what we wanted, we had a lot of strong individual performances...such as Adrienne’s,” Yamin said.
Freshman Marta Lasota and sophomore Gabby Tartakovsky finished tied for fourth and eighth with 13 and 11 bout victories, respectively, in women’s saber.
Beyond the saber trio, Harvard had mixed results, with the epee squad posting a team record below .500. However, after the first two defeats on Saturday, the Crimson completed the tournament with three victories against one loss to climb back to an even record.
Men’s Fencing
Coming off a fourth-place finish at the Ivy Round Robins in 2016, Harvard had high expectations for success this winter, but the team found itself trending backwards, posting a 1-4 team record and a fifth-place result.
However, looking deeper into the results reveals a team that came within a few bouts of challenging Columbia, Penn, and Princeton at the top of the pack.
Losses to the Tigers, Lions, and Yale each came by 14-13 bout scores, with the Crimson’s saber and foil trios emerging with winning records all three times, despite the team losses. The epee group, however, struggled in the three nail-biter defeats, posting 2-7 records each time.
“Had we flipped those [three 14-13 defeats], we would have won a share of the Ivy League title,” junior co-captain Eric Zhao said. “We were right, right in the thick of things…. Beyond that, this was a great experience…. We’re a really young team, and this puts us in a really good position for next year.”
From the individual perspective, Harvard sophomore Eli Dershwitz and freshman George Haglund took the top spots in their respective saber and foil pools. Dershwitz posted a plus-44 touch indicator and a 14-1 record, while Haglund rode a plus-25 touch indicator to a 12-3 mark.
“I have faith that anyone on our team can perform on any given weekend, and this was the weekend for George,” Zhao said. “He showed a lot of maturity that some might not have expected but I certainly did…. He kept his nerve in really close situations and bouts to give him first in his weapon.”

By this point, we’re sure you’ve tried to erase that one conversation you had last semester. You know that conversation. The one where you and your roommates talked about how much better next semester would be. How you made promises to lose weight and get organized over break. How you would finally do a voluntary juice cleanse—not one caused by the lack of options in the dhall.
But, alas, here you are. It’s February, and an abnormal sleep schedule isn’t the only thing you gained over break. But don’t worry! This month (even if it’s almost over) is where you really begin. This is the month where you start on your journey to become an Instagram honey in case Harvard falls through. Here are Flyby’s tips on how (to pretend) to be better than you were last semester.
Stop complaining about your life (at least publically)
Last semester you would’ve spent all of dinner whining about the food. Not this year. Now, all you let out is a soft sigh and pick at your food. After about ten minutes of this, you can quietly bus your tray and head to Jefe’s like everyone else.
Work out (or at least wear workout clothes)
After you start working out, you’ll realize that your body is the same as it was last year. But what you’ll come to realize is that you’d much rather be seen as someone who works out than to actually go through the pain of physical activity. So stock up on those workout leggings, sweatbands, and an assortment of Nike gear. This is the year of pretending to be fitter than you actually are.
Always consult your planner
We all know that you’ve technically had a planner since seventh grade. But buying a planner at the beginning of the year and using it for a week doesn’t count. This semester, whenever someone wants to grab a meal, go over a p-set, or really anything at all, make sure to check your planner first. And we’re not talking about that little calendar app that’s already on your phone; we mean a physical planner. Like, with a cover that makes you seem like a real-life adult. Like, with pages that you can dramatically flip through. It doesn’t even matter whether or not you actually have real events in your planner. What matters is that people think you do. (You can keep a list of your favorite daily snacks in there for all we care.)
Make new friends
The friends you have are great. They helped you through last semester, and you’re ready to tackle this semester together, blah blah blah. But that’s not the point. Remember how over break you spent an exorbitant amount of time on Instagram, wondering how fifteen-year-olds got triple the amount of likes your post garner? This is where new friends come in. Given the student population, Harvard has a surprisingly high proportion of students who are “casually into photography.” Befriend one of them. Nothing helps you step up your Insta game like a camera good enough to cover about 90% of your many flaws.
Convince your parents you’re a lifestyle blogger
We hope these tips put you on the path to a better you. And if not, make sure to check out our brand new blog GuysIPromiseIveChangedThisTime.wordpress.com for more fun tips for a great semester and year!
