After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At some point in my first semester at Harvard, during that first trial-run of freshman fall, I made my friends write down the reasons I should go on living. I used to buy Hi-Chews from H mart, and each one I ate was a last reserve against the thought of dying. Each row of candy kept me breathing. When it was finished, at least I’d made it a minute further into life.
My depression centered on how unbearable I had found solitude to be. I could not live with myself, so toward the end I always had a friend with me physically or on the line. I knew they cared, as deeply as anyone can care, but they felt so far away. I felt so far away.
I write this because I want to normalize depression. I want depression, anxiety, or any mental health condition, to be destigmatized. I wouldn’t even refer to these as mental illnesses, because I think everyone is on a spectrum of vulnerability to these things, especially at this age. A considerable portion of the population is affected — especially at Harvard. I think that if we stopped other-ing mental health struggles as illnesses, we would care more about each other. All throughout my teenage years, I was so afraid of seeing myself as struggling that I resisted getting help. I did not believe that I could be categorized as mentally ill.
I hope every person who goes through some kind of mental health difficulty has the support of someone around them and at least has or knows the possibility of seeking help. It is incredibly difficult here to care about those around you. Everyone slips into apathy. I am guilty of it. To stay alive, I realized you had to be selfish enough to take care of yourself, or selfless enough to live for the people you knew — whichever way of thinking works for you.
It is awful also to be thinking of what your depression will cost you in your future while you are still in the deep rut of it. Much of the ordeal of a mental health leave is how to explain yourself to people, particularly if you live in East Asia, a region that is guilty of mental health stigmatization. My grandmother and many of my family friends still believe that I took a term off only to intern. Of course, most people did not believe this was all there was to the story. The concept of a gap year or gap term was foreign to them, especially since I took one in the middle of a semester.
My parents and I got into many arguments as to what to tell people. I wanted to tell the truth. To think of all the ways I had to go about covering my depression made me depressed. My family would worry about how I was ever going to get a corporate or finance job if people knew: “Why do you refuse our protection?”
To that I willed myself to be truthful, because I don’t care. I hope it will remain this way. I hope I will not regret that I have not kept this a secret.
Sometimes, to that, or to nothing in particular, I wanted to go out and get down on all fours and scream into the grass. I want to do what the cold stars looking on see animals do on the earth. But then as the months went by, without really even knowing how, the days got lighter; my body became lighter on my mind. Perhaps it was the procedures and therapies — never mind if they were placebos. Life was no longer unbearable for no reason. Suddenly I believed in joy again.
What I am grateful for is that, because of my depression, I do not take normalcy for granted. When I came back to complete freshman fall, the sight of Harvard Yard did not kill me. It did not shock or anger me or sweep a melancholy so deep it cut, as I’d feared. I felt calm. This year, I felt as though I loved my solitude again, at least most of the time. Sometimes the loneliness comes and swallows me whole. But most of the time, when I pass the pho restaurant in Chinatown where I’d sat with my despair a little over a year ago, I am half-light. I am completely in my being.
Moments like that — moments of normalcy — they begin to constitute most of your life, in light of the before. You are so glad for this earth. You feel dumb in your apathy and your incredible luck.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is almost impossible to escape news of Harvard University’s pilot “Pulse Survey,” from the University-wide email from University President Lawrence S. Bacow to the blue and red signs blanketing the campus, which proclaim: “Not everyone feels included. Let’s find out why.” “Make Harvard better.” “Your experience matters.”
These surveys come as part of a years-long effort by the Presidential Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging to promote “diversity and inclusion” on campus.
Yet they also come as a slap in the face. The University has dragged its feet in confronting institutional failings regarding the prevention of sexual assault and other forms of violence, harassment, and intimidation on campus. In February, I joined over 70 fellow students, graduate and undergraduate, from the Government Department and elsewhere in calling for an external review of how 36 years of allegations against Government Professor Emeritus Jorge I. Dominguez went uninvestigated and unaddressed. A neutral, third-party investigation of the institutional failings throughout his career would go a long way towards restoring student trust in the University, and show stronger commitment to student inclusion than internal surveys.
An independent investigation would provide the students, faculty, and staff in the Government Department and across Harvard with a clear sense of went wrong from 1979 until at least 2015, what has changed since, and how those changes will prevent these kinds of abuses in the future.
The most recent allegation in 2015 is particularly alarming as it comes after the University supposedly revamped its Title IX policies and procedures following a civil rights investigation by the Department of Education.
More than just the chance to take a quick survey, an external review would certainly make us feel that our concerns are being included in University policy, and that the experiences of survivors of sexual assault matter. It would undoubtedly make Harvard a better place.
Graduate students, faculty, and survivors have therefore requested an external review time and again over the past year. But Bacow and other members of the administration have yet to respond. A “positive response” in private has been accompanied by public silence, with suggestions that the Title IX investigation against Dominguez must conclude before the University considers an external review.
There is no clear reason why this must be the case. Regardless of what comes of the inquiry into Dominguez’s conduct, the allegations against him should have triggered an investigation long before the story surfaced in the Chronicle of Higher Education.
To be clear, a question on the “Pulse Survey” that explicitly asks about the University’s handling of cases of sexual assault is not an acceptable alternative.
The University hardly needs more evidence to justify a thorough review of how it addresses cases of sexual assault and harassment by those in positions of authority.
Let’s assume for a moment that public opinion on campus should have any role in how seriously Harvard takes these protections. Even if the “Pulse Survey” can quantify the level of (dis)satisfaction with how Harvard deals with sexual misconduct, how many members of the community have to be unhappy for the University to act? Is there any point at which the administration will feel compelled to act?
The Crimson Editorial Board has noted the troubling tendency of the University to turn to surveys again and again to give a semblance of inclusion rather than taking concrete action.
The University administration appears happy to ask us for our views so long as it does not have to inconvenience itself in responding to our criticisms.
Public opinion beyond Cambridge seems to count for much more, as threats to the University’s reputation seem to prompt effective and efficient action. Even after decades of incidents that were overlooked, it took not one but two articles in the Chronicle for the University to place Dominguez on leave.
Of course, there is nothing inherently wrong with finding out where problems lie or “taking the pulse” of students, faculty and staff. The task force has done yeoman’s work in identifying the many areas where Harvard can improve in building a true sense of community here on campus, and the results of their work and these surveys can only help inform University policies in the future.
Yet surveys alone cannot and will not allay the concerns and mistrust of many on campus towards the administration unless coupled with change that goes beyond “fine-tuning” administrative procedures and admitting a need for “better communication.”
If the University invites somebody other than itself to be the judge of whether it adequately protects against sexual assault, harassment, or discrimination on campus, it can be a model for other institutions of higher learning that have harbored their own dark secrets and rumors for too long.
Clearly the financial costs of an independent investigation are not the problem, given the resources required to roll out the present public relations effort and maintain the necessary infrastructure for regular polling.
In the meantime, when you get to the survey’s open-ended question, call for an external review.

As a nonprofit institution, Harvard is tax exempt on multiple levels. But for a city like Boston — whose land is shared by the government and nonprofits — such tax exemption poses a significant problem for municipal finance As a result, in 2011, the city instituted the ‘Payment In Lieu Of Taxes’ or ‘PILOT’ program, which calls for some nonprofits that own property valued at more than $15 million to contribute 25 percent of the standard property tax rate both monetarily and through community contributions. For the seventh consecutive year, the University has failed to reach that 25 percent marker, this past year contributing only 79 percent — $9.8 million — of the city’s request.
We are not critical of the University in so far as it failed to reach the city’s requested dollar amount. Our concern lies in the idea that this shortcoming is indicative of a larger unwillingness on the part of the University to meaningfully give back to a community, to which it owes much of its institutional success, and to trust its determination of its own needs. As such, we call on Harvard to assess in a self-critical and honest manner the impact it has had on its municipal community and how it can go about being and becoming the best neighbor it can be.
It’s worth noting that the figures proposed by Boston are based on property values set in 2011. Harvard’s assets have increased significantly since then. Fixed assets alone, within which category property value resides, had risen by 2017 nearly two billion dollars since the 2011 audit, and many argue that assessments of nonprofit assets are often grossly underestimated. As such, even if it were to meet the current ask of the city, Harvard would be offering well below what might be considered even minimally just given its holdings.
But that’s not the main issue here. Though these PILOT figures represent a significant and voluntary contribution, we do not believe that they accurately or fully account for Harvard’s responsibility to the Cambridge and Boston communities. As we have opined in past, the University and its students play a significant role in changing the city’s landscape, driving up rents, and making it more difficult for residents to maintain a high and fulfilling quality of life. The University should be conscious of this impact, as it thinks about the degree to which it gives back to the community directly and through contributions to municipal government.
In light of this, Harvard should attempt to assess fairly and honestly its impact on the local communities and it should recognize and honor its ethical obligation to be said good neighbor.
The lack of fulfillment of the PILOT request in full is troubling because it represents an unwillingness on the part of the University to believe local governance in terms of how much the University actually owes. When the city has already reduced its expectations and when it allows for half of the expected contribution to be fulfilled by a valuation of services rendered as opposed to direct monetary contribution, failure to meet what can only be understood as a very low bar represents the shirking of a much larger responsibility to the community — not to mention the University has now done so all seven years PILOT has existed.
In the seventh anniversary of the reformed program, it’s time for the University to reassess its relationship with the program, considering how it can be a more positive and giving leader in the Boston community.

The healthcare investment firm Deerfield Management has committed $100 million as part of a new alliance with Harvard science researchers aimed at promoting drug innovation.
As part of the deal, Deerfield will form a private company called Lab1636 — owned solely by its affiliates — to support Harvard researchers’ projects in “various stages of drug discovery and development,” according to a press release. The University’s Office of Technology Development coordinated the new partnership.
“We envision the Harvard-Deerfield collaboration as a powerful means to fuel translational research across the University, enabling promising innovations to advance beyond their laboratory roots,” University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 said in the release.
Deerfield has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into drug research at prominent universities around the country, including Northwestern University and Vanderbilt University. The hedge fund also previously pledged more than $50 million to the Broad Institute — a Harvard-MIT research collaboration — to advance “therapeutic research projects,” according to the Institute’s website.
In recent years, Deerfield has found itself in hot water following criminal convictions against two former partners and allegations that the firm’s policies around the use of confidential information were too lenient.
The firm agreed to pay $4.6 million in 2017 to settle claims from the Securities and Exchange Commission that it failed to maintain policies to prevent misuse of private or confidential information, but the firm did not admit wrongdoing. The following year, two partners at Deerfield each received a 36-month sentence for insider trading. The men obtained confidential information about changes to Medicare reimbursement rates from an employee at the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which they then used to participate in trades for Deerfield.
OTD spokesperson Caroline Perry declined to comment on the controversy or whether it had any impact on Harvard’s decision to join the partnership, pointing to the company’s existing funding arrangements with other universities.
“Harvard OTD enters into research agreements with corporate partners who express a commitment to advancing science by supporting research initiated by Harvard faculty,” Perry wrote in an emailed statement. “Our R&D alliance with Deerfield will focus on advancing biomedical innovations toward the development of new therapeutics.”
James E. Flynn, managing partner at Deerfield, called the University an “outstanding partner” in the press release announcing the collaboration.
“The University’s outstanding science, breadth of technologies, and mix of esteemed junior and senior faculty constitute a fertile environment for the continuous generation of novel insights,” he said. “This, in combination with its experience advancing potential therapeutics, makes it the perfect place to establish an impactful translational partnership.”
A joint advisory committee will decide which projects Lab1636 takes on, according to the press release.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Upperclassmen waving banners and sporting House apparel — from face paint to full-body house mascot costumes — congregated in Harvard Yard to welcome freshmen to their new residences Thursday morning.
Harvard’s annual Housing Day informs freshmen living in the Yard of their placement into one of Harvard’s 12 residential houses for upperclassmen for the coming three years.
Many of the upperclassmen “dorm-stormers” awoke early to get breakfast with their Houses, dress in House gear, and blast music before making their way to the Yard. With the crash of a gong at 8:30 a.m., House Committee chairs emerged from University Hall with letters informing freshmen of their new Houses. Then, excited groups of students charged into freshman dorm rooms to deliver the news.
As freshmen poured out of their dorms to share their House placement with friends, their reactions ranged from ecstatic to relieved to devastated.
Blockmates Alex P. Grayson ’22 and Melody M. Wang ’22 said they were thrilled to be assigned to live in Lowell House next year.
“We were in disbelief,” Wang said. “It was like a dream, honestly.”
Wang attributed her enthusiasm to Lowell’s soon-to-be-completed renovation, its high percentage of singles, and its convenient location in Harvard Square.
Mckayley S. Green ’22, who was places in Dunster House for next year, said she was worried about being assigned to one of the three Houses in Radcliffe Quadrangle, which some freshman fear for their distance from the Yard.
“The people that came to the room were chanting ‘Currier’ as they came up the stairs, so we were all a little bit freaked out. But when they came in, we found out they were all Dunster, and we were really relieved,” she said.
Though some students said they were hoping not to be placed in a Quad House, Currier HoCo co-chair Austin J. Lentsch ’20 said he thinks the Quad’s sense of community speaks for itself.
“Even when someone has a midterm later that morning, when they still want to wake up at 6 a.m. to go out and dorm storm," he said. "That’s how you know you have a community that you’re excited to welcome people into."
Madison L. Fabber ’22, a freshman who was placed into Pforzheimer House in the Quad, said that she had been hoping to be placed in one of the Houses there.
“I was like, 'maybe if the guinea pigs like me, they’ll put in a good word?'” Fabber said, describing how she and an upperclassman friend had played with Pforzheimer House's guinea pigs before Housing Day.
House Committee co-chairs from a number of Houses praised the turnout and energy of upperclassmen and freshmen alike.
All 12 Houses hosted events Thursday evening for freshmen to get to know their new Houses and meet current students, tutors, and faculty deans. Leverett House organized a carnival-themed event, complete with cotton candy and an obstacle course, and Lowell threw a party and dinner in addition to weekly Thursday evening tea, according to Leverett HoCo co-chair Rick Li ’21 and Lowell HoCo co-chair Jungyeon Park ’20, respectively.
Lentsch said Currier’s evening activities play an important role in getting incoming students excited about Quad life.
“Sometimes people have their initial knee-jerk reactions and automatically expect a certain thing, but in general that all goes away by the evening, and everyone comes out to the House,” Lentsch said.
Park said Lowell House administrators were enthusiastically involved in Housing Day festivities. Economics Professor David I. Laibson ’88, who will begin his tenure as one of the Lowell faculty deans next academic year, participated in dorm-storming along with students, Park said. Park also said she was surprised to see Lowell Resident Dean Caitlin M. Casey, who is currently on maternity leave, back on campus welcoming new Lowell students.
“Our resident dean gave birth to her daughter on Saturday, like, literally 4 days ago,” Park said. “And Caitlyn shows up with her 4-day-old daughter in Annenberg. It was the most precious thing.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Student Agencies will help launch the HOPP app — a “direct-to-dorm” snack and drink delivery service — on Harvard’s campus during the week following spring break.
Dev — HSA’s web and mobile software development program — built the phone application after being approached with the idea by a client, HSA President James N. Swingos ’20 said. The client was a team of a “dad and his son.”
During HOPP’s initial launch period on campus, Harvard students will be able to order select items from a fulfillment center, according to Nicholas W. Bunn ’19, CEO of Studio 67, HSA’s on-campus marketing agency and the group in charge of HOPP’s rollout. In the app’s early phase, items will be sold at 10 percent off retail price and with no delivery fee.
Bunn said the client approached HSA asking the group to launch the idea on Harvard’s campus as a “beta-test” to gather data for an eventual pitch to investors.
Swingos said the father and son pair who had the idea, are “direct manufacturers” for some of the products that will be sold through HOPP and reached out to HSA “through a connection in our alumni base.”
“They came to us and were like, ‘We want to launch a direct-to-dorm delivery service for some of the products that we make,’” Swingos said.
He said the father-son team also wanted to debut the delivery service “for some products that are close partners” of what they make.
Though Bunn said he recognizes HOPP is similar to some other food delivery apps, he said he believes HOPP’s ability to directly deliver to Harvard dorm rooms — by employing Harvard students as couriers — will give it a competitive edge.
“The added benefit to this over a lot of others is that it’s delivered right to your door because it’s delivered through our student body,” Bunn said. “You’re just going to basically get a knock at your door, open it up, and it’ll be right there.”
He said that two or three students will be staffed at the fulfillment center at any given time and will deliver the products as quickly as they can travel to customers' dorm rooms.
“If you’re living in the Quad, they’re going to have to wait for the next shuttle so that may take a little longer,” Bunn said. “But if you’re in a river house or in the Yard, it should be no more than 30 minutes in the sense that they just basically have to get the order, put it into one of the bags, and walk it right there.”
HSA will publicize HOPP with an initial email notifying Harvard students of the app followed by a promotional event run by Studio 67, according to Bunn.
Bunn said he thinks one of the highlights of the event will feature a sampling of products from Cold Brewtus — a cold brew company based in Burlington, Vt. Along with coffee, HOPP plans to stock kombucha, Spindrift sparkling water, potato chips, cookies, popcorn, and protein bars, according to Bunn.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University negotiators are now considering the full set of economic proposals outlined by Harvard’s graduate student union for its first contract — including issues such as wages and benefits — according to University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain.
Harvard’s negotiators received the last of Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers’ economic proposals during a bargaining session Feb. 22. Before then, only some proposals were offered, and University negotiators tabled conversations while awaiting the full set. Harvard negotiators will now start preparations for a counter-proposal, Swain wrote in an emailed statement.
Swain described the union’s economic proposals’ fiscal impact on the University as “significant” and said that Harvard is analyzing the total financial impact of those proposals on all of its schools.
Evan C. MacKay ’19, a HGSU-UAW bargaining committee member, wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard’s $39.2 billion endowment means the University should offer union members more benefits.
“There is no reason that student workers at the wealthiest university in the world should struggle to make ends meet,” he wrote.
Ashley B. Gripper, another HGSU-UAW bargaining committee member, wrote in an emailed statement that the union has made its proposals with “guidance” from its members.
“We hope that the university will promptly respond to our economic proposals and that we will be able to work together productively to ensure that all student workers can afford to study, work, and live at Harvard,” she wrote.
Swain wrote that the University wanted to consider the economic proposals as a package before offering counter-proposals.
“From the beginning of negotiations, the University has communicated its intent to consider proposals that have economic impact collectively, rather than one by one,” he wrote. “We know that proposals around benefits and compensation can be complex but are critical aspects of a management-labor contract, and that they take time to formulate and negotiate.”
William A. Herbert, who directs the National Center for the Study of Collective Bargaining in Higher Education and the Professions at Hunter College at the City University of New York, said that tabling economic proposals until the total financial impact can be considered is fairly common in contract negotiations.
“In order to be able to determine what the overall costs are for the entire package would necessitate hearing them to examine them altogether, because…one of the primary issues in collective bargaining is going to be costs,” he said.
“The nature of negotiations are that there may be some costs that could be modified based on the total costs in things like health insurance, for example, where it could be that the original cost proposed actually can be less by examining another type of insurance,” he added.
In the interim, negotiators have exchanged counter-proposals on issues that do pertain to wages and benefits, such as a neutral third-party grievance procedures, and health and safety protections. They have come to tentative agreements on four proposals on issues including accessibility to employment records and resources for professional development.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the first Monday of every month, defendants and their lawyers file into Judge Roanne Sragow’s courtroom in Harvard Square’s First Parish Church. She wears the same robe there as she does behind the bench in Cambridge District Court, but at the church she sits behind a plastic table on a folding chair.
This nontraditional setting, however, does not make her work there any less important to those who come before her.
Sragow is the presiding judge for the Cambridge District Homeless Court, which offers these monthly sessions to adjudicate on misdemeanor and non-violent felony charges, as well as outstanding warrants, against people experiencing homelessness in the Cambridge area. The court does not sentence the defendants but instead recommends resources for rehabilitation and sometimes requires them to check back in on their progress over the course of multiple hearings.
The court’s most recent session — on March 4 — almost didn’t happen. After heavy snowfall the night before, Sragow and the defendants’ lawyers were worried the people standing trial that day might not make it. But after a two-hour postponement, 14 of the 25 cases on the docket were heard.
Among those who went before the court that day were defendants Cheryl A. Tucker and John A. Chute, alongside their lawyer, Michael C. Hicks, and a team of 12 Harvard Law School students who assist on the cases.
Tucker and Chute were each charged with different crimes, but their defense team, local law enforcement, and Sragow agree that the Homeless Court provides the two of them — and other defendants who appear before the court — opportunities unavailable in the traditional District Court setting.
Though less than 0.5 percent of Cambridge’s population was homeless in 2015 — the last year for which statistics are available — homeless individuals accounted for nearly 16 percent of Cambridge arrests that year, according to Cambridge Police Department data.
Hicks, who represents almost all defendants who go before the Homeless Court, said that most of his clients — like many people experiencing homelessness who enter the criminal justice system — commit crimes out of necessity.
“A lot of them are committing crimes because they’re homeless,” Hicks said. “Most people that have access to housing, monetary abilities, medical care, food, clothing, don’t commit crimes.”
Chute, who was before the court this month for charges of breaking and entering a motor vehicle, said that resources for people experiencing homelessness can be hard to come by, driving people to resort to actions they would not otherwise undertake.
“People keep committing crime because they’re broke,” he said. “They don’t have money, they don’t have resources, and they don’t know what else to do.”
But addiction also complicates many defendants’ situations. In Chute’s case, he said he has been under the influence of drugs or alcohol during each of his arrests.
Chute, who is 39 years old, first came in contact with the criminal justice system at age 14 for distributing marijuana in John F. Kennedy Park, he said. As a teenager, he started abusing alcohol, which led him to other drugs including cocaine and heroin.
In 2013, he was arrested for robbing a bank and consequently served two years in a maximum security prison in Walpole, Mass. The robbery was the result of an opioid addiction, Chute said. He was medically prescribed opioids after sustaining an injury while working as a carpenter, but eventually the doctor stopped prescribing the pills.
“When I got cut off from my medication, it just became too expensive buying on the street so I turned to heroin, which was a cheaper alternative,” he said. “I needed the money. I was broke and no matter what I did we just never had enough money because of the drugs.”
Law School student Libby S. Bova, who oversees the law students affiliated with the Homeless Court and works with Chute on his case, said that crimes of necessity — such as shoplifting or trespassing — are the result of failed support systems for vulnerable populations.
“We’ve criminalized that behavior, but in some cases if you’re starving or if you really need food or water or you need basic necessities like toilet paper and you’re stealing them from CVS, you can talk about that as a crime,” she said. “But, you can also talk about that as a failure of society to ensure that people of all walks of life regardless of if you have an income or a home have basic necessities.”
Tucker, who also went before Sragow in the most recent session, was arrested as a direct result of substance abuse; her charge was for drinking in public.
Tucker — who is now 49 — was first arrested when she was 29 years old for possession of heroin. Though she did not go to prison for her first arrest, she said she has served a total of 16 years in prison for crimes “primarily done because of drugs” or as “a means to get drugs.”
Bova said that many of the people who come before the court for these kinds of crimes do so because they do not have other places to go.
“They’re just in a situation where they don’t have a lot of options of where else to do that activity, or it’s kind of a side consequence of their status that if you don’t have a home where you could do the things people do day-to-day, all of the sudden when it’s happening on the street it’s a public disturbance or disorderly conduct,” she said.
Many cities across the country have variations on Cambridge’s Homeless Court, and the Harvard Square session is one of two located in the state of Massachusetts.
The Cambridge Police Department and the Middlesex County District Attorney’s office created the Homeless Court in 2016 to provide health and social services to Cambridge’s homeless population, according to Middlesex District Attorney Marian T. Ryan. In 2017, the Homeless Court moved from Central Square to Harvard Square.
Sragow said that Cambridge District Court — where homeless individuals’ cases were previously tried alongside all other cases that came before the body — moved to Medford, Mass. nine years ago because of asbestos in its original building.
The court was unable to provide assistance to homeless defendants after its move to Medford because they were not showing up for their court hearings, according to Ryan.
“It was clear that we have a large population of folks who are homeless in Cambridge who often came into contact with the criminal justice system who weren’t really getting those cases resolved,” Ryan said.
The Medford location is not near public transit and takes just under an hour to reach from Harvard Square and Central Square — where much of the city’s homeless population resides — using a combination of both transit and walking. Because the cases could not be resolved without the defendants present, the court was unable to offer medical and mental health care, and other resources, according to Ryan.
Sragow estimated that the default rate — the proportion of defendants who do not show up for their hearings — among homeless individuals in District Court was more than 75 percent. In the Homeless Court, the default rate is negligible, she said.
The Homeless Court brings together representatives from an array of social and health services; Cambridge police, Harvard University police, and MIT police; and the law student defense team.
The multidisciplinary group convenes prior to each court session to discuss each case on the docket. The group works to determine what it believes is the best course of action for each defendant, according to Sragow.
Compared to his experiences in District Court, Chute said the Homeless Court presents distinct advantages for his particular situation.
“It’s a lot better for somebody like me because they’re more geared towards trying to find you help and resolve the problems that led you to be arrested and led you into the court,” he said.
If he had gone through District Court, Chute said he’d likely be “locked up” right now.
“I’d be sitting in Middleton doing absolutely nothing, getting in trouble, no recovery,” Chute said of the jail where he might be held if awaiting District Court trial. “I’d be sitting there and I’d be faced with all of the same problems when I get out.”
Sragow said that the Homeless Court is designed to help the individuals experiencing homelessness who come before it — not to punish them.
“We are looking to rehabilitate — get people back on their feet — rather than be punitive,” she said.
The Homeless Court’s various affiliates match defendants with social services in Cambridge and help them attain resources in an attempt to remedy the issues that brought them before the court in the first place.
To rehabilitate defendants, Hicks and the Law School students meet with the defendants individually to ascertain what services they need.
“Our perspective as students is to follow clients into whatever needs they might have,” Bova said. “We want to understand what goals they might have and help them work towards that while simultaneously working towards a positive resolution in the criminal case.”
Some rehabilitative pathways include alcohol and drug treatment, assistance in procuring government benefits, and finding employment. The students may also help their clients obtain a Massachusetts identification card, which is often a prerequisite to qualify for benefits or apply for jobs.
“I’ve been able to get my ID, social security, I’m looking for a job, I’m going to AA, I have a sponsor, I’m meeting new people and making new friends, staying sober,” Chute said. “All types of good stuff.”
The Homeless Court, however, faces challenges with recidivism as defendants cycle in and out of the system.
Cambridge Police officer Eric R. Helberg, who oversees CPD’s Homeless Outreach Program, said that recidivism is particularly high among those who struggle with addiction. Cambridge does not track recidivism rates in the Homeless Court.
Tucker has faced this challenge throughout her years in the criminal justice system.
“I was working my ass off to stay clean and sober because it took me like 20 years to get out of the system or being on parole or probation or anything with the courts, and here we go all over again,” she said.
She said that for others, though, the Homeless Court can feel like “a slap on the wrist” and isn’t sufficient to deter some offenders.
Sragow, however, said that if a defendant returns to the Homeless Court enough times, she can return them to District Court.
“We don’t give them a pass,” she said.
Similarly to Tucker, Chute has relapsed before. His first appearance before the Homeless Court was resolved in August 2018. But after staying sober and finding a job at Otto’s Pizza, he had a drink and ultimately became unemployed. In February, he wound up back in the Homeless Court with his breaking and entering charges — the same charge he faced in August.
“I am fearful because I’ve tried to stay sober many times in my life and I’ve failed a bunch of times. So yeah I am nervous about it,” he said.
“I’m really grateful that I’m not in jail. I’m getting a chance to do this again and I don’t take it lightly,” he added.
At the March 4 hearing, both Tucker and Chute provided updates on their rehabilitation progress and received encouragement for their efforts.
Despite anecdotal trends, Helberg still said he does not believe high recidivism rates discredit the court’s work.
“We take our successes individually,” he said. “Rather than trying to say we’ve got 25 or 50 [percent] success rate, if we can get one homeless individual into long term rehab and get them housed, that’s a huge success.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two more wins until March Madness.
As many students prepare to depart campus for spring break — relishing in communal pride with Housing Day still fresh on their minds — the Harvard men’s basketball team will have its season on the line this weekend.
A mere 130 miles south of Cambridge, John J. Lee Amphitheater in New Haven, Conn., hosts this year’s rendition of Ivy Madness — the third-ever win-or-go-home tournament in Ancient Eight history. The Crimson play No. 4-seeded Penn at 12:30 ET on ESPNU, with the winner challenging middle-ranked Yale or Princeton on Selection Sunday at noon on ESPN2.
Harvard fought through three overtime nail-biters and four other conference bouts decided by six points or less to claim its seventh Ivy League regular-season title, clinching the No.1 seed in the four-team tourney. First-team All-Ivy guard Bryce Aiken solidified his return back to dominance after missing the hardwood for almost a full calendar year, pacing the Ivy League in conference scoring at 22.2 points per game over 13 outings. Not to mention the numerous clutch shots he flushed against the likes of Columbia, Penn, Yale, and Columbia again to flip games at risk of L’s into W’s.
The Player of the Year honors, however, went instead to the pride of the Bulldogs — junior wing Miye Oni. The potential NBA draftee has marveled scouts with his versatile playmaking and scoring abilities that have helped him average a third-best 17.4 points per game this season, as well as 6.4 rebounds/game and 3.6 assists/game.
Intra-team sentiment around Lavietes Pavilion obviously leaned toward the man in Crimson (“I thought [Aiken] should have got Player of the Year, but that's just me,” Noah Kirkwood said), but it will be the final products of this weekend that truly matter.
If the Crimson can knock off the Quakers for its third straight win over last season’s Ivy representatives, Harvard will most likely face Yale unless a recently embattled Princeton side can somehow muster an upset.
Amongst all three opponents, Aiken has averaged about 22.8 points per game. Coming off two straight weekends with strong Saturday bounce-back performances, the Randolph, N.J., native can put Harvard in prime position to a tourney berth if he maintains his next-level finishing acuity across two days.
“I thought [Bryce Aiken] had an amazing year,” Amaker said. “We don’t win our league if he’s not anything less than spectacular, and I thought it was that and then some with how he was playing. I was disappointed for him, but we have other good players in our league. Oni was an outstanding player all year as well, so I get it, and I’m biased, but I thought that our guy was outstanding all year for us.”
It has not simply been the Bryce show, however. Ivy League Rookie of the Year Noah Kirkwood broke the Crimson record with seven weekly Rookie of the Week honors, ranking him ahead of previous torch-bearers Siyani Chambers ‘17 and Dan Clemente ‘01. Scoring at a clip of 10.8 points per game in conference play, the first-year Ottawa native has threatened from the perimeter as well as inside with his slashing abilities. Despite his plethora of awards, Kirkwood believed that even more could have been accomplished.
“And if I’m being honest, I felt like I underachieved some of the things I was hoping to do in terms of what my expectations personally were,” Kirkwood said. “...Just getting my assists up or getting guys more involved. I felt I could have done a little better this regular season.”
Although his scoring totals have dropped slightly compared to last season, junior Chris Lewis’ efficiency has continued to hover around the 60 percent mark. Opponents have experimented with the double-team on the Harvard big, forcing kick-outs and some giveaways. But the return of Bryce Aiken has not diminished Lewis’ continued importance inside, especially defensively where the Eliot man is near 2 blocks/game on the season.
With All-Ivy first-teamer AJ Brodeur — who torched the Crimson with 24 points at the Palestra the last go-around — being Lewis’ main defensive responsibility, the Crimson may also need to turn to bench reinforcements to assist in the tall endeavor of limiting the Penn man. Both junior Henry Welsh and freshman Mason Forbes provided relief against Columbia’s Patrick Tapé on Saturday, and Amaker hinted that the same may be the case this upcoming Saturday.
“We are probably gonna have to use different people, he's been that good of a player all year,” Amaker said. “We didn't play you know well against him especially down there at their place, I would imagine that, with Lewis and Henry and Mason, whoever, we could have a variety of different people that could guard him.”
Penn’s top scoring weapons, who have consisted of an overwhelming majority of the team’s offensive output, remain juniors Devon Goodman and AJ Brodeur. The Crimson will have one less complementary player to worry about, however, as freshman Michael Wang will be out with knee issues. Wang had a particularly impressive nine-point first frame against Harvard at the Palestra, but the Quakers will have to look elsewhere — such as wings Antonio Woods, Jake Silpe, and Bryce Washington — for offensive firepower.
“Penn has historically been just a disciplined team, we see that as far as their rotations on defense, them always make an extra pass and making the right plays on offense,” junior guard Christian Juzang said. “...I think whoever wins the small battles is probably gonna come out on top.”
Two other factors defensively for the Crimson? Underclassmen Danilo Djuricic and Kale Catchings, both who have come away in recent games with multiple fast-break dunks after swiping away passes. The two have seemingly fed off each others’ pugnacity inside, offering some strong finishes at the rim while demonstrating the capability to shoot from deep.
Harvard previously beat Penn in overtime off of a thrilling finish, which included a now-signature Bryce Aiken last-second triple. It fell by just six in its follow-up game at Lavietes Pavilion in what was a 59-53 defensive tug-of-war.
John J. Lee Amphitheater, with no Yale uniforms on the court, shall be a peculiar sight on Saturday. But with Penn squeezing by in the tournament with a do-or-die win over Brown to complement three straight wins to close the season, it will be top-ranked Harvard who may face some added pressure.
Not so for Christian Juzang, however.
“I'm more so excited than feeling pressure,” Juzang said. “That's my thing. I'm excited. We got an opportunity to stay alive in this thing and an opportunity to keep our postseason going. So for me, it's just excited to get back to work this week, and to have another weekend alive.”

Whenever anybody drops by Cambridge to visit us, we are faced with a dilemma: do we flex on them as hard as possible or go the humble route? Do we go on typical Harvard tourist activities or drag them to only niche hole-in-the-walls? Ah, the trials of living on such a tour-able campus.
For the ‘Salt of the Earth’
If your visitor is all about the small things, take them on a stroll along the Charles River. The views from the Weeks footbridge are sure to be a reminder of the sheer scale of the Harvard community. Grab some HUDS oats for any ducks and geese you may see swimming along (avoid dumping them on the crew team). Bonus points if you drop some wisdom about how the sights remind you “to stop and enjoy the journey once in a while before it’s all gone.”
For the ‘Pseudo-Intellectual’
If your friend is convinced that Harvard is a temple to wisdom and innovation, maybe avoid Lamont and the realities of college life. Go to Widener instead where the grandeur of the Loker Reading Room and Harry Widener’s study with its Gutenberg Bible are sure to impress. If that’s not enough, swing by the stacks and show them floor after floor of books that encompass all of human history. Maybe leave out the other thing students do in the stacks.
For the ‘Goldman-Sachs Interns’
If your guest is more interested in Harvard’s endowment than our classes, opt to take them to the Harvard Art Museums where all you need to sound fancy is to talk about the “brushwork” and say those few words you remember from French 10. Casually drop alumni names like FDR and JFK. Finish it off with brunch at Henrietta’s Table. Just don’t mention you’re paying with Crimson Cash.
For the ‘Party Animal’
Let’s be real — social life at Harvard is a struggle. This option is rather niche, but if your person is interested in living out a scene from “Spring Breakers,” a final club is probably your best shot. If you’re less inclined, however, you could go the Quad and crash a couple of parties there. Hit up the common party spaces like the Aquarium or the Igloo. Make sure you get there early though; if the ambulances are there before you, you’re probably out of luck.
It’s ultimately up to you to figure out what your visitor is looking for in Cambridge, but fortunately, Harvard’s got a wide range of options for all kinds of people. If none of these are calling to you, maybe just take them to grab a burrito from Jefe’s at midnight and then watch Netflix together in your common room. It won’t be amazing, but at least it’ll be realistic.
