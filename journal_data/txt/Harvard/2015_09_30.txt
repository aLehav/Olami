After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One has to wonder how many canisters of fog juice Chromeo used up during their set. The duo was so wreathed in the fog that the icy white spotlights ended up diffusing throughout the stage, casting the entire space in an icy-white glow. The entire tableau bordered on tasteless.
But then, that’s kind of the point. Electro-funk duo Chromeo’s Boston Calling performance was so unabashedly kitschy that, at some point during the set, it rolled back over into the territory of unambiguously cool. From their trademark Rockette-legged keyboards to their matching sunglasses to their gloriously awkward names, David “Dave 1” Macklovitch and Patrick “P-Thugg” Gemayel pursued their tacky aesthetic with so much zeal that even the most embittered concert-goer would find himself hard-pressed not to jam along.
The set started off with a slightly extended rendition of the song “Intro,” from Chromeo’s 2007 sophomore effort, “Fancy Footwork.” Though a slightly narcissistic choice of opener, the performance did rouse the relatively sedate Boston Calling crowd into an enthusiastic chant of “Chrom-eee-oooh….ooh, ooh,” à la “The Wizard of Oz.” The duo then launched into their 2009 hit “Night by Night,” drawing cheers from the crowd. Dave 1, microphone in hand, jumped off the stage to sing with the front-row concertgoers, dancing along the edge of the glow-stick swinging crowd.
Throughout the set, Dave 1 and P-Thugg had an absolutely commanding stage presence, playing up their contrasts to great theatrical effect. The lanky Dave 1, dressed in a retro leather-jacket-and-torn-skinny-jeans ensemble, strutted around the stage with a loose, self-assured energy, while the stocky P-Thugg, ensconced behind his keyboard, served as a striking counterweight to Dave 1’s borderline manic stage demeanor.
The duo followed Night-by-Night with “Somethingood,” off their 2014 album “White Women.” In one of the most stirring moments of the set, P Thugg emerged from behind his keyboard with an electric bass and proceded to jam out back to back with Dave 1, a move that would have been tacky and grating were it not for its sheer earnestness; the duo were enjoying themselves immensely, and their enthusiasm spilled over into the crowd.
Chromeo followed up “Somethingood” with “Over Your Shoulder,” another song from “White Women.” The groovy, relatively low-key number provided a temporary lull in the set, priming the crowd for uptempo track “Sexy Socialite,” also from White Women. During this number, the band committed one of its only aesthetic slip-ups: P-Thugg left his post to jump down and jam with the front-row concertgoers. When juxtaposed with the crowd, P-Thugg’s unruffled cool quickly collapsed down to a certain stiffness, and the tableau, as shown on the venue’s gigantic screens, was awkward.

Alt-J’s Boston Calling’s performance was a delight to listen to—the band performed many of its biggest hits with energy and style. But the sense of hipster-esque remove that characterizes so much of Alt-J’s oeuvre was, on some level, incompatible with that ideal music festival high-energy climax. Alt-J refuses to be poppy—their complex, atmospheric compositions are intended to be bona-fide soundscapes. Their music does not have danceability in mind as a key metric. In the end, Alt-J’s Saturday night set served, for the most part, as a decrescendo to the evening—magnificent, technically stunning, and musically innovative, but a decrescendo nonetheless.
Appropriately, Alt-J started off its set with the song “Intro,” off their debut album “An Awesome Wave,” and the crowd roared as its delicate, rolling melody gave way to an intense, slightly brooding synthline. The band followed with “Every Other Freckle,” a hit off its recent sophomore offering, “This is All Yours.” The warbling, hypnotic number segued into somber, folk-rock lament “Something Good,” off “An Awesome Wave,” which, with its mellow, resigned tone, created something of a lull in the crowd’s energy.
The band followed up with “Left Hand Free,” the highest-charting song off “This is All Yours.” The twangy, southern-rock piece, which Alt-J itself described as “the least Alt-J song ever,” revitalized the audience and drew resounding cheers from the glow stick-equipped crowd. With its catchy, distinctive riff and repetitive lyrics, the number marked a peak in the crowd’s energy.
It’s somewhat telling that “Left Hand Free,” a song very different from Alt-J’s usual offerings, elicited such a visceral response from the crowd. Alt-J’s dominant image is somewhat at odds with the aesthetics of a concert, and this was shown by the band’s feel onstage. Alt-J’s stage presence throughout the festival mirrored the overall tone of their music—slightly impersonal and detached. The band’s frequent use of vocal harmonies over a single voice, combined with the detachment of its overall sound, effectively denied lead singer Joe Newman true frontman status, impairing his function as a focal point for the crowd.
The band’s lightshow further enhanced the group’s slightly distant vibe, with the group often strongly backlit, the members reduced to silhouettes against a complex backdrop of lights. Alt-J’s onscreen presence furthered this impression; extensive editing effectively rendered the band members faceless amidst beautifully colored, quasi-hypnotic background visuals. All this was entirely consistent with their image, but not especially conducive to that sense of personal engagement and in the moment-ness that is so often a main draw of the concert setting.
After “Left Hand Free,” the band played a sequence of tracks from “An Awesome Wave,” including “Bloodflood”, “Dissolve Me”, “Matilda”, “Interlude 2”, and “Tessellate.” After that fugue, and a piece called “The Gospel of John Hurt” from their newer album, Alt-J launched into their cover of Bill Withers’ “Lovely Day,” previously seen as a bonus track on “This is All Yours”. The group’s rich, warbling sound imbued Withers’ R&B hit with a newfound emotional ambiguity, though it didn’t particularly enrapture the crowd.
Alt-J followed up with a few more songs off “This is All Yours” before ending the set with “Fitzpleasure,” a heavy, rhythmic, resonant hit off their debut album. But the crowd, no doubt expecting to hear “Breezeblocks,” their biggest hit to date, demanded an encore. Alt-J obliged, and played three more numbers before (finally!) launching into a spirited performance of “Breezeblocks.” Airy yet intense, alternating between a rhythmic throb and a rolling melodic flow, this final track allowed both the band and the crowd to attain a previously unreached level of energy as the song slowly crescendoed to its syncopated climax.
Alt-J’s image isn’t that of a concert band, and though that dissonance didn’t go unnoticed, the group’s undeniable musical chops made their set strong, though not quite historic.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Festival closing act Alabama Shakes proved itself to be a veritable force of nature late Sunday evening, taking the stage at Boston Calling as a historic supermoon eclipse combination reached its peak in the sky above. It was undoubtedly the most eventful set of the entire weekend, starting with lead singer and guitarist Brittany Howard howling at the blood moon overhead and continuing through surprise highlights such as an impromptu marriage proposal, facilitated by Howard, during the performance.
Alabama Shakes remained on stage for almost an hour and a half, performing songs from both of its albums: “Boys & Girls” and this year’s “Sound & Color.” The group’s soulful rock sound made them a perfect closing act for the festival’s diverse earlier lineup, and their distinct Southern charm was undeniable. This was especially the case due to frontwoman Howard, who maintained a constant level of intensity throughout—in one case, playing on even when a string on her guitar snapped mid song. During the occasional guitar solo, she unhesitantly delivered a world-class performance that left some concertgoers riveted while others clapped and whooped with adulation.
The Alabaman quintet was joined onstage by additional instrumentalists and backup singers who rounded out the group’s sound, almost transforming City Hall Plaza into an intimate nightclub lounge. Although the band deliberately omitted “Hold On”—arguably their biggest single—from the performance, they played other hits such as “Don’t Wanna Fight” to great success. Hundreds of hands pumped along to the funky guitar riffs of that song, following along with Howard as she sang over and over, “I don’t wanna fight no more.”
Repetition is a strong factor in the band’s music, and in the group’s performance of “Joe,” a heartwrenching song from the bonus track edition of “Sound & Color,” Howard used it to great effect. About the eponymous Joe she laments, “I still ain’t got what I want.” Another standout performance, of their newest single “Gimme All Your Love,” culminated in a lengthy guitar solo by Howard followed by echoing choruses of the song’s title.

How would Harvard be different if the Women’s Center occupied the Porcellian building?
Perhaps if the Harvard Foundation lived in the Owl?
A queer house in the Spee?
After Brianna J. Suslovic and I wrote “Dismantle Final Clubs Now” last April, I heard many people defend final clubs. At Harvard, our reflex is to defend. We regard threats to our institution as threats to our legitimacy as people, and as achievers, and our sense of self-worth comes under attack. We (myself included) find ourselves taking an unproductive, reactionary posture.
But what if you take all that away for a moment? The inertia, the aura of inevitability that surrounds final clubs on campus? What if we dismissed the heated and petty arguments about them and asked one simple question:
What could happen if final clubs went away?
A picture begins to paint itself when we loosen the strings that hold together our imagination about the future of Harvard. The Owl is quite a large building—perfect for a collaborative, intersectional place. The Women’s Center moves from its cozy Canaday hideaway to proclaim intersectional feminisms in that stately building on Holyoke Street. The vestiges of a long and dominating history come down, with little fanfare and mostly excitement. The Center is expanded, and includes classrooms for Women, Gender, and Sexuality courses. Vibrant discussions and debates about feminisms abound. The Center becomes a campus priority, both symbolically and physically moving from a basement to the core of campus. Once a bastion of aggressive masculinity, the Owl serves those it worked so hard to exclude for so long.
Such a moment—the replacement of the Owl with the Women’s Center—existed first in my mind, and I suspect in the minds of not a few others. But it did not permeate our campus’s collective imagination about what is possible. That is now changing. With questions, we have reached a tipping point. In the near distance we see two options: the status quo, domination of campus social spaces by exclusivity, or a bright, actively inclusive future. What is viewed as possible on this campus in terms of productive social spaces and forging a new reality has swelled. A moment is here.
The Spee decided to invite women to join. Some claim that the club "joins" the "21st Century." While I agree that accepting women into final clubs is certainly a productive step toward something, I don’t see multi-gender final clubs as inclusive. This small, long overdue step does not herald openness. It merely assimilates people of non-male genders into an organization that positions itself as “fun” by excluding.
The history of final clubs gives us no reason to believe that acceptance of women will change their overall dominating nature. The clubs’ extraordinary funding, influence, and the position of economic dominance held by club alums should offer plenty of reason to question the clubs’ commitment to social porousness they seem so eager to espouse in light of recent criticism.
Certainly Harvard itself is exclusive. However, comparisons between the exclusivity of Harvard and that of the clubs ignore Harvard’s purported commitment to creating education opportunity and improvement of society. Whether Harvard follows through on that promise is a debate for another day. The point stands that the clubs have made no such commitment or promise. They are mum on issues and oppressions of grave importance.
The clubs are profoundly dangerous spaces for many on this campus. Transformed, the buildings would become safer, allowing for debate and improvement. The clubs have an interest in maintaining their dominant position and history, and thus will never take active steps to create real, meaningful inclusion. This point resonates especially when one considers the fact that archaic alumni boards govern the clubs. Inclusion is not high on their list of priorities.
President Faust and Dean Khurana have staked out a very encouraging position, that “'nothing' is off the table” with reference to the final club situation. Legal experts believe dismantling the clubs is within Harvard’s immense power. Now that the conversation is swirling nationally and the pressure is on, I extend a challenge to President Faust and Dean Khurana: Do it. Dismantle them, and do it now. The clubs have survived thanks to inertia and apathy. Now that a political and historical moment has arisen that makes it feasible and defensible for Harvard to get rid of the clubs for good, President Faust and Dean Khurana must take advantage of it and eliminate this embarrassment as soon as possible. To do anything else would be negligence to Harvard College’s mission: to responsibly educate future leaders.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students of the College don't have to wait for faculty dinner to dine with their professors anymore. Beginning this semester, the Office of Undergraduate Education will fund small groups of students to dine with faculty members at certain restaurants in Harvard Square as part of a pilot program called Classroom to Table. Though the College would do well to publicize this initiative more aggressively, it deserves credit for launching a well-conceived attempt to provide students and faculty with more informal opportunities for interaction.
Harvard receives a good deal of criticism for failing to foster strong student-faculty relationships, especially in comparison to smaller liberal arts institutions. Given the size of many courses, the busyness of the faculty, and the relative rarity of opportunities for interaction, undergraduates often have a difficult time getting to know their professors beyond the classroom and office hours.
This situation presents obvious drawbacks. Students’ experience in college is often shaped by their relationships with faculty. Informal meetings with professors can enrich students’ academic experience and can make the academic environment of a classroom less intimidating and more open to discussions. In addition, student-faculty interactions help develop stronger mentorship relationships.
Both students and faculty seem to want more opportunities to talk outside of the classroom and to develop more lasting relationships. The tradition of faculty dinners, perhaps the best existing institution to promote student faculty interactions, has elicited praise from professors and undergraduates. Moreover, the Classroom to Table program itself is the result of faculty and student proposals, like one presented by Eliot senior Sharon Zhou '15 and supported by her House Master, Douglas A. Melton.
Clearly, the demand exists for more non-academic settings in which students and faculty members can interact, and Classroom to Table may provide just such a forum. If the current, test stage of the program is to serve as an effective pilot, however, the College must do a better job publicizing it to students. Aside from one email to students signed by Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay Harris on September 3, communication has been lacking. Given the need for some coordination on the part of program participants, the Office of Undergraduate Education should send more reminders as the semester progresses and students begin to feel more comfortable with their professors.
A healthy faculty-student relationship is at the heart of the academic community that the College seeks to foster, and Classroom to Table is a positive step towards providing that relationship with every opportunity to develop. With better publicity and a little effort from professors and undergraduates, it has the potential to become become a beloved institution and the source of many rewarding moments.

"A Vote of Confidence"
To the Editor:
We write to say that we disagree strongly with the Crimson’s April 4 staff editorial, “To Rebuild Trust, Hammonds Must Resign.”
Those of us who work closely with Dean Evelynn M. Hammonds admire her as a colleague in the academy, as a faculty colleague, and as Dean of the College. We have seen her grapple with countless issues on behalf of both students and faculty.
Those of us who are House Masters have been intimately involved in the difficulties of balancing transparency with privacy and confidentiality. We know that as the school year began in September, there was an unprecedented level of anxiety amongst our students and their families as the Ad Board began to adjudicate, as fairly and individually as possible, the cases associated with the cheating scandal. Students were on edge. Resident deans were on overdrive. And eyes across the country were on Harvard.
We were all alarmed at the possibility that the confidentiality of this much-scrutinized process could be compromised when an Ad Board email appeared in the press. Preserving the privacy of students was critical to the process. As the cases unfolded, we believe that foremost in the mind of Dean Hammonds was the confidentiality of the deliberations concerning the students. It is difficult to deal with situations that are without precedent, but the Office of the General Counsel was engaged at each step.
President Drew G. Faust made clear at the April 2 meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences that, upon her review, she found no consistent policy across the University on email privacy and that there are two conflicting policies in FAS.  She announced the launch of a University-wide task force on email policy and a legal review of this particular case in which many of the critical junctures involved confidential discussions.  In doing so, she set a positive course for the future.
We disagree with the Crimson’s unsubstantiated allegations about confidential matters currently under investigation. We believe that Dean Hammonds’ apology and explanation was generous, heartfelt, honest, and exemplary. Let it be an instructive lesson for all of us in dealing with complex issues.
We affirm our confidence in the leadership and the integrity of Dean Hammonds. This is a time to come together, show respect, and have thoughtful dialogue about such difficult matters.
The below signatories are all faculty and/or House Masters at Harvard. Asterisks denote House Masters:
Emmanuel Akyeampong, Ali Asani, Dorothy Austin*, Robert Bates, Robin Bernstein, Vincent Brown, Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham, Homi Bhabha, Suzanne Blier, Lawrence Bobo, Glenda Carpio, Luis Fernandez Cifuentes, Jean Comaroff, John Comaroff, Diana Eck*, Caroline Elkins, Henry Louis Gates, Jr., Virginie Greene, Jennifer Hochschild, Biodun Jeyifo, Michele Lamont, Christie McDonald*, Ingrid Monson, Marcyliena Morgan, John Mugane, Jacob Olupona, Stephanie Robinson*, Michael Rosengarten*, Tommie Shelby, Kay Shelemay, Jim Sidanius, Doris Sommer, Ronald Sullivan*, and David R.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s a brisk day in March 2008, and I’m going door-to-door in Pennsylvania clamoring for prospective voters to support Senator Barack Obama. I have done extensive research, know the nitty-gritty of each candidate’s policies, and relentlessly—perhaps even petulantly—insist that the people I encounter come aboard the campaign.
The thing is: I’m 12-years-old, have a voice the pitch of Mariah Carey’s 5th octave, and am being followed by my mother, who, I insist to the Pennsylvanians, is only there as my means of transportation.
It isn’t the campaign slogans that lure me in. It isn’t Obama’s foreign policy or plans for climate change either. No, my almost primal support for the Senator is not based on concrete policy; it’s centered around the idea that Obama genuinely cares about the well-being of all Americans—that he became a politician to make the world a better place.
I root for Obama like I root for the Knicks, and just as my mood fluctuates with Knicks wins and losses, I become emotionally attached to every piece of legislation the President advocates for during his first term in office. When he wins legislative battles, I win. When he loses, I’m devastated.
Fast-forward a few years.
President Obama’s second term is almost over. I’m 19-years-old now, a sophomore in college. In the last year, I’ve stopped writing about politics, fallen slightly out of touch with the day’s most contentious issues, and haven’t even officially registered to vote. “Yes, we can” has become “Sure, I might as well.”
My 12-year-old self would be wildly confused.
It’s hard to pinpoint an exact moment when my mindset changed. But, as Hemingway might say, “gradually, then suddenly,” I became apathetic to the whole politics thing. Sure, I’ve had moments of genuine pride in the political system—when the President signed the Affordable Care Act, repealed “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” ended the Iraq War, etc.—but now it comes from a much more cerebral place.
Change is slow. Intransigence is real. Legislation has earmarks. It’s harder to look at politicians with blind optimism at 19 than it is at 12.
It’s not like I don’t discuss the hot button issues at the dinner table. And it’s not like Obama’s speech on race in Selma last year didn’t give me goose bumps. But at some point, I decided that politics were inherently corrupt—that even positive legislative developments only happen for nefarious, self-aggrandizing reasons. I went from believing in The West Wing’s version of government to House of Cards’ and I definitely wasn’t going to knock on doors in Pennsylvania this fall.
But then I saw John Boehner step down as Speaker of the House and my whole worldview spun on its axis: I started believing in politics again.
Now, if you’d have told me in 2010 that John “Hell No You Can’t!” Boehner would reinvigorate my hope in the political system, I would have laughed in your face. Boehner was the symbol for the Republican Party’s resurgence—an orange villain less tasteful than Snooki and scarier than any jack-o’-lantern.
But watching Boehner’s press conference this week—in which he sacrificed his personal political standing in an attempt to salvage his party—gave me the same warm feelings I got in 2008. Because regardless of whether or not I share his point of view, I recognize that Boehner has spent the past 25 years serving our country the way he thinks is best—“[fighting for] smaller, less costly, more accountable government.” And however misguided his policies may be, I admire his relentless dedication to making this country a better place.
Some will say that pressure was already mounting for him to resign, and it was probably inevitable that he would leave office soon one way or another. But it doesn’t matter how we got here: This week, Boehner put political ideology aside, and made a decision that helped save the very government he’s fought for so long to shrink.
Of course, this doesn’t give me the same kind of hope I had at 12-years-old. And it shouldn’t. I know now that sweeping change is rare, and politics, more often than not, is about creating incremental progress, not radical reform.
But Boehner reminded me that while many politicians may be craven and opportunistic—and the political system might not be all that I thought it was in 2008—few things beat politics when it works. And even if I might just be setting myself up for disappointment, I’m ready to become emotionally invested again.
After all, even after a lifetime of losing, I still tell myself this will be the Knicks’ year.

The thing about feeling incredibly empowered by an animated children’s television show the summer after your freshman year of college is that you feel like you’ve been waiting forever it to happen. You remember the way you felt in elementary school, identifying with all the quirky young white kids, often white boys who were the main characters of all your favorite shows. Watching “Foster’s Home for Imaginary Friends,” watching “The Powerpuff Girls,” watching Cartoon Network when you weren’t supposed to, feeling almost there, almost like you’d found the kind of normal you could finally vibe with, then realizing no, maybe almost, but not quite.
Basically, I have a lot of feelings about "Steven Universe." "Steven Universe" is a show about semi-mythical beings (it’s confusing, it’s a children’s show so they spend ten episodes on fluffy filler and one episode explaining the actual science fiction of the show) who derive their powers from gems that are kind of lodged in their physical beings. They’re basically contained in the gems, and from there have the power to create humanoid forms. It’s kind of like “Orange is the New Black,” where the main character is a sort of boring white person and a cast of amazing characters of color branch out from their normalizing center, for the ad-execs, or whatever. There’s a character who is probably non-binary. One character exists as a fusion between two female identified characters who are in a relationship with each other. Anyway, it’s on Cartoon Network.
I spent my whole childhood waiting for the show. I stopped feeling empowered by being a “nerd” because nerds didn’t look like me, nerds weren’t awkward black girls with rectangle glasses and crocs. Nerds didn’t have the kind of problems my family had, didn’t think through the turmoil I did, didn’t get me. So I couldn’t get them, and so I watched my brother see superhero movies (and of course, he couldn’t get into them either), and so we sat at home and played Super Smash Bros. and went to school and tried to relate to the other kids who played Super Smash Bros, and failed miserably. (Granted, I was awful at SSB, but I was also like seven, so give me a break.)
The thing about being in high school and feeling incredibly enlivened by white pop punk bands is that you can yell along to the songs in your parents’ car, but at the end of the day, you aren’t worried about the things that they’re worried about. You aren’t worried about getting the girl, well, you are, but mostly you’re worried about whether or not getting the girl will ruin your relationship with your family, or whether getting the girl will put you in real, actual danger. And you can sing really loud, but you still don’t sound like the lead singer of The Wonder Years, and it still doesn’t feel like he could possibly get that.
It’s like how all your friends are mad hyped about Bernie Sanders, and you wish you could feel that excited about Bernie Sanders, but you can never be too sure that the things you care about care about you.
But this time, maybe the thing actually is for you. And maybe you identify so strongly with so many characters that you start to feel silly. And maybe you watch for a day straight, and you’re screaming and crying. And it’s a kids show, so it’s silly, but the last time you felt like you could relate to a show like this it was “Glee,” and everyone was problematic as hell, or it was “Pretty Little Liars” and the writing and production quality not only left absolutely everything to be desired but also left all the queer women sad or dead. And so it’s silly, and in no way is it perfect, but maybe it’s yours. Maybe this time you’re not just pretending. Maybe you sing the theme song on the way to class and the trees and the bricks and the stained glass start to feel like home. And all the brown people, all the queer people, even the ones you don’t get along with, even the ones who you’re intimidated by, even the one’s you don’t know and who don’t care to know you, are here to save the day. To save their own days, and everyone else’s. And today you get to be the superhero. You get to “save the world and then go out for pizza.” You get to geek out, alone in your bedroom, not worried about whether or not the fandom will look at you funny. Because you’re a crystal gem. Because you know what it feels to be shattered. Because you’re a long, long way from home. Because you didn’t get the girl. Because this place is so unfamiliar. Because it all hurts, all the time. But it doesn’t matter. Because you always find a way.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some students reacted strongly to the news that Al’s Harvard Square Cafe and the Harvard Square location of the Clover Food Lab would be among the several businesses vacating the Smith Campus Center over the next few months.
During their years in the Square, both Al’s and Clover have become popular local institutions, and their forthcoming departure because of planned renovations to the Smith Campus Center caused a stir among some students. 

For Sarah S. Fellman ’18, the news that Clover was one of many stores slated to close by early 2016 came as a surprise.
“I am so, so sad that Clover’s closing,” Fellman said.
A vegan herself, she praised the wide selection of fresh, vegetarian options, including her personal favorite item on the rotating menu, the chickpea fritter sandwich.
Fellman also cited Clover as an ideal place for meetings. “It’s got a great location close to everything,” she said. “Plus, I can even bring my non-vegan and non-vegetarian friends with me.”
However, not all students’ memories of Clover were as fond.
“I walked into Clover, and as someone who is from Los Angeles, I assumed they would have healthy and nutritious options, but was sadly met with nothing,” Jack H. Stone ’19 said. “It was all unhealthy vegan fare meant for the cheap Massachusetts palate.”
Albert B. Corvah ’18, a Crimson business associated, said he lamented the imminent loss of Al’s as a convenient lunch option that served impressively sized sandwiches. Corvah, who typically goes by “Al,” said he likes to joke that he shares a name with his favorite sandwich place in the Square.
“It was pretty disheartening,” Corvah said of the impending closure of Al’s. “I had an emotional connection with Al’s.”
Corvah, whose go-to sandwich at Al’s was the hot chicken parmesan sub, recalled his first time at Al’s, when he was just a senior in high school.
“I remember taking a picture of [Al’s] when I came here during Visitas. Everyone was thinking that I had started my own restaurant,” he said.
It is still unclear which, if any, of these Harvard Square institutions will return to the renovated Smith Campus Center when construction concludes in 2018 or what the businesses will do in the interim.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While the federal government last week concluded that Princeton does not discriminate against Asian and Asian-American applicants in its admissions process, experts caution that Harvard—currently facing similar charges in a separate lawsuit—is still not guaranteed a win.
Last November, the anti-affirmative action group Project on Fair Representation filed a lawsuit alleging that Harvard’s admissions processes set illegal quotas on students of Asian descent and “target percentages” for underrepresented minorities. The lawsuit, which targets the College’s use of race-based affirmative action, is in its discovery period as both parties gather evidence to use in court.  
The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights found that Princeton’s admissions policies are consistent with prior U.S. Supreme Court rulings, concluding an investigation that began in 2006 and was expanded in 2008. Investigators also concluded that Princeton had not created a quota system to limit Asian-American applicants.
“The OCR is saying that there are a lot of smart kids that aren’t getting in, and Asians are just a part of that group,” said Parke P. Muth, a former associate dean of admissions at the University of Virginia. “So right now racial discrimination is not a compelling argument.”
Edward Blum, the man behind the lawsuit against Harvard and another ongoing affirmative action case about the University of Texas at Austin, wrote in an email that he was not aware of the Princeton OCR report, but that it “has no bearing on this lawsuit.”
But David Mainiero, the director of college counseling at InGenius Prep, was more confident that the Princeton verdict would set a precedent for Harvard.
“The elite schools that they’re talking about are very careful about their admissions practices,” Mainiero said. “The charge of an explicit form of discrimination probably isn’t well-founded, at least by the letter of the law.”
Muth, however, also warned that Harvard’s fate would depend on the return of Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin—the high-profile lawsuit alleging that a white woman was denied admission to the school because of her race—to the Supreme Court. A ruling in favor of Fisher, the other case backed by Blum, has the potential to end affirmative action programs at colleges across the country.
“In the Princeton case, they’re using race as a factor in admissions because it is still legal to do so,” Muth said. “If the Supreme Court rules differently, that would change the dynamics of these kinds of cases.”
Harvard has filed a motion to delay the lawsuit against it until a verdict is reached on the Fisher case.
The lawsuit is one of several recent challenges to Harvard and its use of affirmative action, a policy that administrators maintain is critical for fostering campus diversity but faces mounting scrutiny. For her part, University President Drew G. Faust promised a “vigorous defense” of Harvard’s admissions practices earlier this month, pledging that Harvard would “speak frequently and forcefully about the importance of diversity in the months to come.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Yearbook Publications has organized make-up photo sittings for seniors who missed earlier sessions in an attempt to maximize the number of students pictured in the publication, distributed yearly during senior week programming.
The Yearbook is currently missing the photos of 600 seniors, including members of Quad Houses, whose sitting dates started on Monday and last through Oct. 2. 
Yearbook president Dennis Lee ’16 said that he “sincerely hopes” with the additional sittings, all seniors will have the chance to be pictured in the yearbook, even if they were unable to attend their original sitting.
For seniors who opt out of in-person sittings, Harvard Yearbook also offers the option to submit personal photos for a fee of $50, though only “a couple” students have pursued that option so far, according to Lee.
That fee, which exceeds the in-person fee of just $10, is a result of differences among studios, said Lee. The studio that the Yearbook contracts through might have to make adjustments to student-submitted photos in order to make details like background color consistent throughout the yearbook.
Still, some seniors said they were unaware of the exact rationale for the greater cost for submitting photos.
Will G. Tobias ’16, who has already had his photo taken, said, “I’m not 100 percent sure why it costs more money to take your own picture, but I’m sure they have a good reason for it.”
Yearbook Publications is notifying seniors of the added sessions over email and with posters, joining the several rounds of publicity the group has sent out since last spring.
Despite these efforts, several seniors said they were unaware of the make-up sittings.
Those who have gone through the sitting process, however, said that they enjoyed their sittings. Leah C. Singer ’16 said she appreciated the number of stylistic options offered, and Elizabeth F. Jacobson ’16 said she enjoyed the opportunity to dress up for her photo.
Make-up photo sittings will take place at the Yearbook Office at 2 Brattle Sq.

UPDATED: October 6, 2015, at 3:37 a.m.
During Pope Francis’s historic visit to the United States, more than 50 undergraduates to travel to Philadelphia this past weekend and catch a glimpse of the leader of the Catholic Church.
Several students said that the trip, an initiative of the Harvard-Radcliffe Catholic Student Association, provided a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to witness the pontiff in action.
“I wanted to see the leader of my faith, and it felt like it would be an opportunity to get to know God,” Bryant W. Huggins ’19 said.
AnnMarie C. Healy ’16, the co-president of the Catholic Student Association, said that she had already seen the Pope this past summer while studying abroad, but felt that the Pope being in the U.S. was an important moment in its own right.
“It was such a historical moment since it may be the only time this Pope comes to America in my lifetime,” Healy said. “It was also important for me to be able to represent Harvard and to show that there is a Catholic presence on campus. We do exist, and we’re vibrant and interested in growing in our faith.”
Others noted the sense of togetherness that arose due to the common experiences participants shared during the trip.
“It was really cool to be with a bunch of people my age who were similarly moved by seeing the Pope,” Cecilia Laguarda ’17 said. “We were like a bunch of teenage girls at a One Direction concert because it was really exciting for us to hear the Pope speak.”
Father Mark W. Murphy, who serves as the undergraduate chaplain of the Harvard Catholic Center, said that Pope Francis’ openness has earned him popularity and the nickname of “the People’s Pope.”
“When people think of God, they want to focus on God’s message of mercy, compassion, and dialogue. The Pope embodies that. He’s a uniter,” Murphy said.
Emily Click, assistant dean for ministry studies and field education at the Divinity School, was similarly moved by Pope Francis when she saw him during his visit at the White House.
“What was very striking to see was the degree to which he combined strength and humility. To see him arrive in a tiny black Fiat showed his strength in embodying his principles and having humility with a purpose,” Click said.
She added that she plans to follow up on the trip by leading a session with Divinity School professor Francis X. Clooney for their faculty in which they will reflect on the Pope’s American tour. In addition, she will feature Pope Francis as a case study in a leadership course she instructs at the Divinity School, HDS 2925: “Administration and Leadership.”
Father Murphy said that he hopes to have a meal for all the participants in which they will be able to reflect on their time in Philadelphia. For its part, the Catholic Student Association plans to have a speaker come in at some point this semester who will talk about the theme of family that Pope Francis highlighted in Philadelphia, according to Healy.
“I hope this trip impacted people's’ lives in a positive way and that they want to become more faithful because of it,” Healy said.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: October 6, 2015
An earlier version of this article and the caption of an accompanying photograph incorrectly stated that two Divinity School faculty members accompanied a group of undergraduates to see the Pope in Philadelphia. In fact, the two faculty members saw Pope Francis on two separate trips, to New York and Washington, D.C., respectively.

Echoing the criticisms leveled by top College administrators against Harvard’s final clubs, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said the all-male social organizations are “not consistent with the mission of the College.”
In an interview last Friday, Fitzsimmons reiterated comments made earlier this year by University President Drew G. Faust censuring the unrecognized clubs. While Faust also expressed concern over the potential for sexual assault and alcohol use to occur on the male final clubs’ off-campus properties, Fitzsimmons centered his criticisms on what he said are issues with how accessible the clubs are to women and students from different socioeconomic backgrounds.
“It is unfortunate that only half of our students would be eligible for these clubs, based on gender, and that there’s also an economic background issue,” he said. “Both of those kinds of things are certainly not part of what we consider the Harvard mission to be.”
Fitzsimmons’ comments are the latest in a conversation about the social clubs that has recently intensified both on campus and beyond. Earlier this month, the Spee Club became the first of Harvard’s eight all-male final clubs to invite both men and women to participate in the punch process after more than 150 years, drawing praise, skepticism, and nationwide media attention.
Leading the campus dialogue is Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, a vocal critic of what he has termed “exclusivity” in all spheres of undergraduate life. While Khurana has declined to say whether he was involved in the Spee’s decision to go co-ed, Fitzsimmons mentioned Khurana’s outspokenness as a catalyst for discussion of the clubs in the Admissions department.
Harvard severed ties with its all-male final clubs in 1984, and the College still does not officially recognize the five all-female final clubs, five fraternities, and four sororities that Harvard students now may join. This uncertain relationship—with meetings between administrators and final club leaders largely occurring out of the public eye—can be difficult for admissions officers to explain to potential applicants, according to Fitzsimmons.
“They don’t understand the difference between frats, sororities, and final clubs, because frats and sororities are more ubiquitous across the country,” he said in the interview, which Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Rachael Dane also attended. “Many people are thinking of the two as equivalent, which they’re not.”
Fitzsimmons said he has heard concerns from applicants about final clubs, their gender-based membership restrictions, and their socioeconomic makeup, but added that most applicants “are quite well informed about what goes on at colleges.”
“Certainly both President Faust and Dean Khurana have discussed the final clubs in depth even in the past week. Those are questions that came up,” Fitzsimmons said. “We describe [them], try to give people a realistic description of what they are. ... They are not consistent with the mission of the College, and so we’re very straightforward about that.”

In the weeks after the College rolled out its first honor code, undergraduate members of the Honor Council—the student-faculty body tasked with enforcing the policy—are adjusting their schedules as the Council hears its first slate of academic integrity cases.
The Honor Council, which is charged with reviewing undergraduate cheating cases, launched this fall along with the College’s new honor code, a product of years of planning expedited by the Government 1310 cheating scandal, Harvard’s largest in recent memory. The Council consists of three separate teams of eight people who will alternate hearing cases. 
While Honor Council Secretary Brett Flehinger declined to comment on whether the Honor Council or one of its three subgroups has already started hearing cases at meetings, Maria P. Devlin, a Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Ph.D. candidate who serves on the Council, said two of the three teams have heard cases.
For some students on the Council, the time commitment so far has prompted them to reevaluate their schedules, but they said the work has not proved too unmanageable. Already, many student members have stayed for additional periods of time on campus—after final exams last spring and before the start of this semester—to conduct training, while others worked as interns this summer for the Council.
Throughout the term, the teams will alternately convene in four-hour weekly blocks on Mondays, according to Devlin. The Honor Council as a whole will also convene periodically for additional training and “calibration,” Flehinger said.
“On average, I probably spend five hours a week, perhaps five to eight hours a week on the Honor Council, so it’s a significant time commitment,” said Jonathan G. Jeffrey ’16, a member of the Council. “I have found my involvement to be very manageable.”
In an email, undergraduate Council member Nathaniel R. F. Bernstein ’17 characterized serving on the Honor Council as a “substantial time commitment.” Bernstein wrote that the obligation affected how he organized his schedule this semester, but added that he believes the Council’s work merits a large time commitment.
Devlin also said the work was a large commitment but said leaders on the Honor Council have been cautious to ensure that the positions do not amount to an “undue burden.”
“Getting an education and being in the classroom is their primary commitment," Flehinger said of the Honor Council members.
Beyond hearing academic integrity cases, the Honor Council, as stipulated in its procedures, will host occasional town halls to “to explain its work and describe matters that have given rise to inquiry by the Honor Council.”
Flehinger said the Council members are planning an upcoming event centered on teaching expectations, and the panel will include faculty as well as undergraduate members of the Honor Council.

As Congress and Americans debate the future of Planned Parenthood and its federal funding, some Harvard students and area residents weighed in, donning pink and canvassing in Harvard Square in support of the organization on Tuesday night.
Planned Parenthood, which among many other women’s health services provides abortions, has come under fire in recent months after videos surfaced purporting to show organization officials discussing the sale of aborted fetal tissue for a profit, which is illegal.
Planned Parenthood officials have denied the practice, maintaining that the video was heavily edited to mislead, the group continues to face criticism, with Republicans in Congress threatening to pull its federal funding.
On Tuesday, Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards testified before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and supporters of the group wore pink clothing and posted on social media as part of a national “Pink Out Day” campaign.
At Harvard, students joined in, on Facebook and in person. Following efforts to collect signatures of support for the group, campaign participants—who hailed from Harvard, Wellesley, Brandeis, and the Cambridge area—gathered in Adams House for a presentation by Planned Parenthood patients and speakers who argued for protecting the non-profit healthcare provider. The Harvard College Democrats and Planned Parenthood Advocacy Fund of Massachusetts organized the two-part event. 
“With all the negative publicity surrounding Planned Parenthood, we thought it was really important to show our support and to show that this is really important to a lot of people in that all the plans to defund it would really negatively impact a whole community of people,” said Susan X. Wang ’17, vice president of the Harvard College Democrats.
Kanisha Hans, a speaker, said the organization provided her access to reproductive health resources as a young adult. She was enthusiastic about Tuesday’s turnout.
“It’s very reassuring to see such a big crowd like this, especially seeing so many young people,” Hans said.
Jacob R. Carrel ’16, president of the Harvard College Democrats, argued that it is unfortunate that Planned Parenthood could lose resources because of the political battle playing out in Washington. He and others involved with the event stressed that the organization provides services beyond abortion and other means of birth control.
Brianna J. Suslovic ’16, a Crimson columnist who also spoke at the event, argued that it is necessary to maintain both a cultural and political conversation in legislatures and among the public on the issue.
“I think that upon leaving this event the challenge is to keep people motivated and to keep people talking,” Suslovic said.

A team of researchers from Harvard have developed a breakthrough in battery technology that they say can store renewable energy in a non-toxic, non-flammable, safe, and low cost way.
Batteries of this nature are paired with the collection of renewable resources “to store massive amounts of energy sources from solar and wind so that we can reuse it when the sun goes away, or the wind stops blowing," according to Kaixiang Lin, a member of the research team and a Harvard graduate student. 
Many members of the research team believe that the development of a cost-effective, environmentally friendly flow battery can have significant implications in the energy and resource issues the future.
"This is the greatest problem facing humanity this century," said Professor Michael J. Aziz, the project’s principal investigator. "Any efforts to mitigate this problem could be very well appreciated."
According to Qing Chen, a postdoctoral fellow in Materials Science and Mechanical Engineering who is also a member of the research team, the improved battery is already on par with its less green alternatives, but the team plans on continuing to improve its efficiency.
With the ability to store energy, people will not need constant access to a power grid, which cuts down on cost, and allows for local production of energy, said Lin.
According to Aziz, one-fifth of the world’s population does not have access to electrical grids on a day-to-day basis. This technology could revolutionize their energy accessibility, while remaining eco-friendly.
The team’s principal goal is to make alternative renewable sources less expensive than non-renewable energy, explained Roy G. Gordon, one of the lead researchers of the battery’s chemistry and a professor of chemistry and materials science at Harvard. "Then we'll have a real stampede to clean energy sources, when it is actually less expensive.”
In three years, the research team hopes to have fully developed a commercially ready battery suitable for single family homes.
They have sufficient funding for now, but after the spring of 2017, Aziz said he is unsure who will provide capital. They will seek funding to sustain research through at least 2020.

As far as football goes, hardly anything of note happened after 9:50 remained in the third quarter of Saturday’s matchup between Harvard and Brown.
By that point, the Crimson had built a 46-0 lead off three passing touchdowns, two rushing touchdowns, one fumble-recovery touchdown, one high-snap safety, and one blocked-punt safety.
There was more action in the press box than on the field as statisticians scrambled to find the last time that the Crimson had scored so many points or recorded so many safeties against the Bears.
Between the lines, the game continued apace. Brown stuck with backup quarterback Kyle Moreno, and the junior put together a quietly torrid performance: 20-of-31 overall and 307 yards, more than twice the 151 yards that Harvard senior quarterback Scott Hosch recorded.
The deficit shrank, too. A 46-0 gap became a 53-27 finale, salvaging some pride for the Bears fans that would make the long, cold trip back to Providence.
Some stuff did happen after 9:50 in the third quarter, but unless you play fantasy football with Ivy League players, and unless you have Crimson freshman running back Noah Reimers on your roster (60 rush yards, two touchdowns), the last quarter and a half of Harvard-Brown competition said precious little about the quality of the two teams.
It was not nail-biting football. It was, however, great entertainment.
In a predetermined blowout, especially on a cold evening, the rules of spectatorship change. The on-field action no longer rivets the crowd, so it is permissible for eyes to wander to the injured cornerback with his crutches, the defensive coach with his headset, and the shivering fans with their blankets and scarves.
Among other things, one notices that marching bands play an active role throughout football games—this isn’t just a halftime-and-go-home show for them. Even through the chills of the fourth quarter, the Harvard band remained in place, leading cheers and feigning ignorance of the six-touchdown margin.
The Brown band attempted the same act, although to a lesser degree of success. Across the field, several drummers idly tapped their sticks and looked glum.
Was the tapping an attempt to stay warm? Was it sarcastic applause? Or was it a mental tic brought on by watching score after inexplicable score?
Only a smattering of fans had stuck around to wager guesses. An exodus had occurred between the halves as fair-weather college students realized that a concrete bowl in New England might not be the most comfortable place to spend a late September night.
That, and certain lucky students received tickets to Boston Calling at the end of the second quarter. Vouchers validated and blowout underway, Crimson fans could return to the warmth of their rooms, winners on both counts.
Meanwhile the referees stayed the course. Dressed in long sleeves, they continued to dictate order until the final whistle.
During one kickoff, a center referee tripped, fell to the ground, and came up hobbling, but he decided to stay in the game. There was 20:40 left at that point.
None of these oddities would have drawn attention if Harvard and Brown had been locked in a one-score battle. As it was, the Crimson’s two-and-a-half quarters of total dominance distracted fans from watching football.
The situation will not always be this way.
Harvard may have appeared unbeatable at points on Saturday, but the Crimson was helped by a series of charitable bounces and Bears errors.
You don’t line up for a fourth and 51, as Brown did three minutes into the third quarter, without a smidgen of bad luck and worse play.
Soon, and perhaps very soon, a Saturday will come when Harvard stares uncertainty in the face, and fans have to lock into every snap because the larger result hinges on it.
But two weekends have come and gone, and the Crimson has never trailed. Through these 120 minutes, Harvard has given spectators a rare luxury: the freedom to observe a football game as something other than a football game.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fresh off their most successful seasons of the last decade, the Harvard men’s and women’s ice hockey teams will enter 2015-2016 ranked among the top 10 squads in the nation.
According to U.S. College Hockey Online’s preseason rankings released Monday, the Crimson icemen will open the year ranked No. 8 in the country. Meanwhile, less than a year removed from a national championship game, the women’s team nabbed the No. 4 spot in last week’s USCHO and USA Hockey Magazine polls.
Earning the top two spots in the women’s rankings were Harvard’s two 2015 Frozen Four opponents—Minnesota and Boston College. The Gophers, the defending champions following their 4-1 title-clinching win over the Crimson, received all 34 first-place votes between the two polls. The Eagles took second after suffering just three losses last season, two of which were to Harvard—one in the Beanpot championship and another in the NCAA semifinals.
This year, the Crimson will have a chance to compete for a title closer to home as the Frozen Four moves to New England. And with co-captain defenseman Michelle Picard, senior goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer, and its three leading scorers all returning in 2015, Harvard has the makings of a team built to make another national run.
With nine of 12 first-place votes in the ECAC coaches’ preseason poll, the Crimson also has been tabbed as the favorite to earn the conference crown. But with three other teams from the ECAC cracking USCHO’s top 10, Harvard’s path back to the NCAA tournament will be far from a cakewalk.
Right on the Crimson’s heels is No. 5 Clarkson, who stole a share of the regular season ECAC title with a 1-0 win over Harvard on the season’s final day. Trailing close behind is No. 7 Quinnipiac, who fell to Harvard by a score of 2-1 on three separate occasions, and No. 10 Cornell, whom the Crimson defeated in the ECAC title game, 7-3.
For a team that has won at least 20 games in four straight seasons, a conference championship was hardly a surprise. The same could not be said, however, for the other squad that calls the Bright Center home.
Last season, ECAC media members tabbed Harvard’s men’s team to finish 10th in the conference. But defying expectations, the Crimson climbed to No. 1 overall in the Pairwise rankings midway through the season and then rebounded from a sluggish second half to capture its ninth ECAC tournament crown in program history.
Harvard will no longer be flying under the radar. With senior forward Jimmy Vesey and its four other leading goal scorers returning, the Crimson is expected to boast one of the nation’s most potent attacks. Vesey, who was voed co-captain this offseason, scored a Division I-best 32 goals last year and has been named to College Hockey News’s preseason All-America team.
The majority of the question marks surrounding the squad lie in the defensive zone after having lost blue-line scoring threat Patrick McNally, co-captain Max Everson, and starting netminder Steve Michalek to graduation.
Nonetheless, the USCHO panel gave Harvard a vote of confidence with a No. 8 ranking. With one first-place vote, the Crimson is among a record-10 teams to receive a first-place vote in a USCHO preseason poll.
Harvard was one of five ECAC teams to crack the top 20, along with No. 12 Yale, No. 18 Quinnipiac, No. 19 St. Lawrence, and No. 20 Colgate. Last week, the Crimson topped the ECAC coaches’ preseason poll, while the Bulldogs earned the top spot in the media poll.
The pair of Ancient Eight rivals battled six times last season, with Yale sweeping the regular season series, 3-0. But in the ECAC tournament quarterfinals, Harvard erased a decade-long losing streak in New Haven en route to a 2-1 series win.
The Crimson then advanced to Lake Placid, where the team defeated Quinnipiac and Colgate for the conference crown.
In 2016, Harvard will also square off against No. 1 Boston College and No. 3 Boston University. The Crimson dethroned the then-No. 1 Terriers last November before falling to BU in double-overtime in the first round of the Beanpot. This year, Harvard will open the Beanpot against the Eagles, with whom the Crimson split its two contests last year.

As exciting and wonderful as HUDS always is, sometimes, it’s nice to take a break from fresh asparagus toast and venture into Harvard Square. It can be hard to imagine, but there are actually other things to do here besides go to Felipe’s rooftop bar on a Friday night. For those who crave flavor, here’s a PSA that benefits you: Maharaja, the Indian restaurant that’s been closed from a fire in 2014, recently reopened above Staples.
For those less aware of the history of the restaurant, it was once a well-functioning place that enjoyed the business of both hungry students stopping in after buying school supplies and of everyone else who didn’t want to go to the other Indian restaurants in the Square, Tanjore or Chutney’s. Then Maharaja’s kitchen had a fire, and the restaurant shut down. The only clue left for disheartened customers was a paper sign that said, “We’ll be back soon!” We despaired.
But now, the restaurant is open again for lunch and dinner every day of the week- we highly recommend the lunch buffet because when you have the choice between unlimited food and limited food, you always choose the former. Welcome back, Maharaja.
