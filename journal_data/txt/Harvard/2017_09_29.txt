After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was more than a little strange to see James Franco playing a lead role in a much-anticipated HBO drama. We all know how spectacular HBO dramas can be, and we all know how much of a goofball James Franco can be. So going into the pilot of “The Deuce,” a show about the shady underground world of prostitution in 1970s New York, I was a bit nervous. As always, HBO proved me wrong. The pilot was the start of something great: It was an 84-minute episode filled with clever dialogue, intriguing storylines, and charismatic and engaging characters. However, some of my reservations proved justified. Franco is not the best lead man HBO has ever chosen, and this role may be a bit of a stretch for him.
“The Deuce” introduced many compelling storylines in the pilot, along with some foreshadowing of how they will interact. The main storyline is that of the descent into desperation of our protagonist, the good-hearted and hard-working Vincent Martino (Franco). He works two jobs, his wife cheats on him, and he gets threatened by his identical twin brother’s creditors. It seems that these desperate circumstances will be the motivating factor when Franco’s Vincent turns towards New York’s darker side. Although his parts are well written, Franco isn’t the best dramatic actor. In the pilot's opening sequence, Vincent is mugged and bashed over the head with a gun—his feeble pleas for help were the first indication of Franco’s lack of dramatic ability. Considering how promising the show seems, Franco just doesn’t live up to the abilities of other leading men in television dramas of the past decade. He is no Bryan Cranston, Jon Hamm, or Damian Lewis.
Another storyline we caught a glimpse of is the shady underground world of prostitution. The portrayal of New York’s darker underbelly was both disturbing and enchanting. Maggie Gyllenhaal portrays Candy—a prostitute who refuses to have a pimp. Candy is a fiercely independent woman in a world filled with pimps who abuse and assert their dominance over their workers. Gyllenhaal creates a believable and cohesive character. We are also introduced to Abby (Margarita Levieva), an NYU student who is sharp and quick on her toes, who ends up at Vinnie’s bar—along with various pimps she meets along the way—and immediately strikes up a connection with him.
With these and many more interconnections, the show has a wonderful assortment of ideas and plotlines to draw from in the future. The interweaving of multiple stories creates a richer, more fantastical world than would be possible with just one storyline. Moving forward, this world should only get better.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The light was dark, so I twisted a moth
between my fingers, and its wings
fell like shreds of paper. A pulp
lay underneath: dense, beating,
unmistakably the heart. It gushed so heavy
I thought it was sobbing, but it was
only drawing one last gust of breath,
chambers swelling and quieting
above the warm heft of my thumb.

The summer was humid and thick,
thousands of moths congregating
under the belly of a lamppost. In streets
and bars, men played Mahjong
or smoked until the room curled gray.
Their children slept upstairs,
cocoons among rolls of blankets.
I always wondered if they’d grow
to be butterflies, vast and tall, dribbling
hoops or masquerading down
blonde halls grinning and gold.

But for now, the cocoon is a house,
a series of nesting dolls, one
only breaking into another. The adults
spew cards from their fingers,
and Mandarin rolls from their tongues
like a toy sword: playful,
sparring. The room bubbles shining,
laughter a roaring brook
tremoring through this low part
of the valley, and they collapse
breathless against their seats.

Yet tomorrow is a new world,
and they’ll wake with heads low,
flowers sunken with dew. A vein
of football and the office
water cooler and thousands of small
unheard things rushing through,
refusing the tongue. Some will fall
silent and meek, eclipsing
themselves into a small night, enough
for one, an eyeball of light
rolling its own dance until dawn.
Thousands of songs and phrases
from the motherland breaking loud,
a terrain of memory sprouting
within an ashen, steeled face. A butterfly
of the dusk and dust.

Salman Rushdie, a writer long celebrated for his masterful command of magical realism, has notably kept his latest novel, “The Golden House,” well within the realm of the real. Rushdie’s style change is due in no small part to the fact that this most recent work deals with the decline of early Obama-era optimism and the rise of bitter sectarianism and vitriol, culminating in the election of President Donald Trump—a series of events so tumultuous that a simple retelling of the past eight years feels surreal enough.
And so Rushdie begins his retelling on the day of Obama’s inauguration, when an unreasonably wealthy and mysterious family moves to Greenwich Village and reinvents itself. As with the rest of his oeuvre, in “The Golden House,” Rushdie relies heavily on myth and allusion to flesh out his characters and create dramatic tension. The patriarch Nero Golden is a man of grandiose stylings, hiding a dark past; his eldest, Petronius, is a garrulous agoraphobe who struggles with his anxieties; the middle son, Apuleius, wrestles with the intersection between art and politics; and the youngest son, Dionysus, faces a bitter and damaging conflict with his own identity.
Rushdie speaks through René, an aspiring filmmaker who views the mystique and spectacle of his newly arrived neighbors as inspiration for his upcoming film. By embedding himself in the lives of the Goldens, René embarks on an eight-year-long journey familiar to many Americans who lived through the Obama years; a journey in which online and real life echo chambers breed sectarian resentment and bigotry; a process where the very idea of identity, whether that be sexual, gender-based, or racial, gets caught in a vicious game of tug-of-war between an increasingly social justice-oriented left and an increasingly reactionary right; a period of time where previously untouchable conceptions like truth become politicized.
This journey, of course, culminates with the election of “the Joker,” a character who surprisingly plays only a minor role. The brilliance of Rushdie is that he portrays Trump as not a disease but as a symptom. Rushdie makes clear that Trump was not a tragedy that befell an undeserving America but in fact a direct reflection of the way Americans interact with themselves and the world. “We are so divided, so hostile to one another, so driven by sanctimony and scorn, so lost in cynicism, that we call our pomposity idealism, so disenchanted with our rulers, so willing to jeer at the institutions of our state, that the very word goodness has been emptied of meaning,” says the narrator.
A bleak resignation, this sentiment is also a call to action, as a way to rid ourselves of not just Trump, but the modes of living which made Trump possible. In the final pages of the book, Rushdie speaks straight to the reader that in the midst of “whatever manufactroversy, whatever horror or stupidity or ugliness or disgrace … our little lives are perhaps as much as we are able to comprehend.” In the face of a frightening new political reality, we must not only confront the regime but begin to confront ourselves.
The failure of the novel ultimately comes from the breadth of content it tries to cover. Within “The Golden House,” Rushdie attempts to capture the cultural, political, and social zeitgeist of the Obama years too broadly, stretching each aspect too thin, and the result is a novel that would have been better off addressing fewer issues in a more focused manner. Additionally, Rushdie’s allusions occasionally lose their beneficial properties and become either too varied or too obscure. At one point in the novel, Rushdie describes a garden as “the setting for a Japanese ghost story, Ugetsu, perhaps, or Kwaidan.” “The Golden House” has important things to say about the current state of politics and culture in America, but they can get lost in a sea of references to Greco-Roman mythology, European and Asian mysticism, film history, and East Asian folktales.
Ultimately, “The Golden House” is a project of great ambition and scale, and one that, for the most part, lives up to that ambition. The decline of the Golden household represents an impressive microcosm of the larger events that shaped American society over the past eight years. In the end, Rushdie gets his dramatic voyeuristic masterwork, as does René: One tracks the tragic exploits of a group of estranged family members, gradually insulating themselves over petty differences, and the other makes a film about the Golden House.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When it comes to instructions that may one day determine whether you’ll live or die, you must ensure that your entire unit understands their equipment. As such, Army training often caters to the lowest common denominator. The guidelines on an MRE (Meal Ready to Eat) advise one to lean the heater on a “rock or something,” the business end of a Claymore mine reads “Front Toward Enemy”, and the AT4 (an anti-tank weapon) is adorned with a childlike illustration of a soldier captioned “fire like this.” As it turns out, these illustrations and guidelines that I had until recently considered comical were designed for fools like me.
During our first day of summer field training, my squad was made weapons squad. For the uninitiated among you, a weapons squad is responsible for the maintenance, operation, and transportation of their platoon’s machine guns. The M240B, the machine gun that was soon to become my friend, is a large, bulky weapon than proves rather uncomfortable to carry regardless of how you hold it. Your typical weapons squad is comprised of your platoon’s most experienced enlisted soldiers, not some random square from Harvard. Nevertheless, the powers that be love laughing at my expense, and so after an hour-long weapons familiarization course, I found myself holding a machine gun for the first two days of field missions.
However, the M240B is a crew-served weapon, meaning I had two wonderful accomplices to share in my suffering. The first was a salty gentleman from Tennessee who had already deployed to Afghanistan twice. His 27-year-old mind was not pleased with having to spend 32 days training with college kids, and he boasted a tendency to ruthlessly roast those he deemed annoying. My second accomplice was a young cadet from Virginia Tech, who—despite his polite nature—had a pair of crazed eyes that made me uncomfortable. All in all, I feared incurring their wrath and hoped to avoid disaster for as long as possible. Less than 24 hours later, I failed.
I am not the most relatable cadet; I have a habit of sadistically laughing at my own misery, which unnerves my peers. I am also prone to rambling, which—unsurprisingly—mixes poorly with sleep-deprived, dehydrated cadets. However, I decided to spare my gun team and do the impossible: remain silent for the entirety of our first mission. Oddly enough, the day I kept quiet, the universe decided to get loud on my behalf.
As our team neared our objective, the opposing force opened fire on our forward element (for clarification, we were firing blanks). Immediately, my compatriot from Tennessee sprang into action and bolted towards the sound of gunfire. I—in all my wisdom—stared at him blankly before realizing that, as the one with the machine gun, I needed to follow him; after all, he was the one carrying our ammunition. I stood up, ran-face first into a tree, gathered my senses, and followed my ammo bearer into the Kentucky underbrush.
When we had finally reached a decent position from which to suppress our cadet adversaries, my ammo bearer handed me our first belt of ammunition (I had foolishly forgotten to have a starter belt ready). As I opened the feed tray and prepared to load our weapon, my ammo bearer gave me a look of absolute horror. “Brass to grass,” he yelled, “Brass to grass!” I had no idea what he meant; I saw neither grass nor brass nearby. Dumbfounded, I stared right back at him, taking my eyes off the enemy as they neared our position. In frustration, he loaded and snatched the machine gun and commenced firing himself. Only then it struck me that I had almost loaded the belt upside down, the Army equivalent of sticking a fork in a toaster. “Brass to grass” was a mnemonic device, my ammo bearer’s frustrated attempt to help me recall that the yellow side of the belt faces the ground when loading.
And so there I sat, completely useless, waiting around as someone else did my job. I felt ashamed and frustrated. “You had one job,” I thought to myself. Moreover, my squad knew that I attended Harvard, and I feared the inevitable torrent of snarky comments to follow. And yet, those comments never came. Once the exercise had ended, my ammo bearer took the time to pull me aside and answered my questions regarding our weapon system. A few missions later, my inexperience gave way to comfort, and although I was by no means an expert gunner by that point, I would walk with pride (and exhaustion) whenever I carried the M240B.
Cadets and students alike tend to mistake inexperience and ignorance for incompetence. I’ve seen cadets mock their peers for otherwise minor mishaps. Likewise, I’ve witnessed entire classrooms spend an eternity tearing a single student’s comment to pieces, each speaker eager to make their peer’s folly known. My ammo bearer had every right to mock me; had he not stopped me, I would have likely injured myself and broken our incredibly expensive weapon in the process. And yet, he did something else entirely; he taught me how to properly handle my gear.
It’s easy to laugh at seemingly stupid people. Doing so makes us feel smarter and secure as we confirm to ourselves that we’re not the village idiot. However, what I ask is that you do something harder and far less entertaining: give the alleged fools in your life the benefit of the doubt. Teach them. Mentor them. Help them. And just maybe, they’ll one day return the favor and help you keep your “brass to the grass.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We, the undersigned students of Harvard University, write to condemn Harvard’s complicity in Education Secretary Betsy DeVos’s destructive policies and her attacks on survivors, students, and public education.
Last Friday, the Department of Education released a Dear Colleague Letter that withdrew critical Title IX guidance on campus sexual violence. This letter was the result of meetings with so-called “men’s rights activists,” who have dismissed sexual violence, endorsed victim-blaming tactics, and opposed protections for LGBTQ+ people. It was signed by Candice Jackson, head of the Department’s Office for Civil Rights, who claimed that 90 percent of campus sexual assault accusations are false. This unsubstantiated narrative of false accusations merely serves to silence survivors and invalidate their experiences.
In interim guidance, the Department has allowed schools to revert from the preponderance of the evidence standard to a “clear and convincing” standard. This is problematic because it fails to allow all parties a level playing field. It advocates an interim measures process under which the burden to seek accommodations rests on survivors. In addition, it withdraws school accountability for 60-day investigations, allowing drawn-out processes that are often re-traumatizing and unfair to all parties involved. These measures are unjust to survivors.
On Harvard’s campus, the far reach of rape culture is well-documented. According to survey data, 19.9 percent of women, 5.2 percent of men, and 27.5 percent of trans and gender nonconforming students at Harvard reported experiencing sexual assault during their time in college, and offenders include faculty members. Yet unlike many other schools, Harvard has failed to publicly affirm that improvements to our policy made under the 2011 guidance and Title IX investigation against the University—including the adoption of the preponderance of the evidence standard—will not be rolled back. It has failed to commit to continue improving the policy, regardless of federal standards. And it has failed to commit its significant influence to ensure that survivors’ rights are maintained in new Title IX rules and regulations. This makes Harvard complicit in DeVos’s agenda to silence survivors.
The Harvard administration’s failure to protect survivors also extends to graduate student workers. Harvard continues to block efforts to hold a new and fair student union election as recently ordered by the Regional Director of the National Labor Relations Board, choosing instead to file an appeal to the Trump NLRB that threatens the foundations of fair union elections across the country. A union contract allows for the establishment of a neutral process completely removed from the University’s bureaucracy to handle sexual harassment complaints. The recent complaints filed to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission against a faculty member at University of Rochester continue to highlight why such alternative measures are required. Given the uncertainty at the national level, the Harvard administration should be standing with its student workers rather than actively thwarting efforts to establish more robust protections against sexual assault and other forms of discrimination on our campus.
In addition to the recent Title IX reversals, Secretary DeVos’s agenda advocates scaling back federal regulations and returning public education in the United States to de facto segregation, a phenomenon already occurring under the guise of “school choice.” Harvard’s invitation for Secretary DeVos to give the keynote at a pro-school choice conference, which fails to include any critics of this stance on education policy, legitimizes her opinion as the most salient solution for issues in public education. We believe that Secretary DeVos is unqualified to lead “A Conversation on Empowering Parents” as her policies are yet another example of how the education of Black, Latinx, and other marginalized communities are unaccountably placed in the hands of private entities. Additionally, because research shows that school vouchers effectively subsidize segregation and disproportionately serve white middle class students, we question whose parents her initiatives supposedly “empower.”
In rolling back restrictions for for-profit colleges and hiring former for-profit college officials, Secretary DeVos legitimizes the dangerous and unchecked systems that for-profit colleges use to further disenfranchise vulnerable populations. Secretary DeVos recently attempted to simplify the narrative of victims of for-profit college defraudment to just wanting free money in order to promote her agenda. Secretary DeVos’s poor understanding of predatory lending relates to her inexperience with school loans, another federal program that stands to lose protections As an elite institution, Harvard should be deeply concerned at the Secretary’s efforts to enable an elite few to profit from higher education. We urge our fellow students and the greater Harvard community to question our complicity in this administration’s wielding of white supremacy and toxic toppling of public education.
We, the undersigned, support students and survivors in all communities. In lieu of our University, we chose to stand in opposition to the leadership of the Department of Education and the plundering policies for which it stands.

Over the years, Harvard presidential search committees have had to actively work to ensure that students have an input in their secretive selection process. During the search in 2000 that selected Lawrence H. Summers as University President, there was no formalized way for incorporating student voices in the process. When the search committee reconvened in 2006 to select Summers’s successor, the question of student input was reopened. In reaction, the presidential search committee announced that they would be working with a student advisory committee to bring a student perspective to the selection process. Their precedent has had a lasting impact, given that 18 students representing all 12 of Harvard’s schools have been selected to advise the ongoing search.
Some critics have worried about the influence that student advisory committees have as mere advisors to the presidential search committee. Some have gone as far as to suggest that students should serve directly on the search committee. While student advisory committees are not a foolproof way of ensuring student input, we believe it would be misguided for students to serve directly on the search committee itself.
Students will inevitably be influenced by the policies that the next leader of Harvard takes, but they do not have the administrative knowledge required to choose an appropriate successor to current University President Drew G. Faust. Undergraduates especially are not trained in higher education administration or other general forms of management. Many of the members chosen to serve on the presidential committee have worked at universities and in management positions themselves, bringing knowledge and experience that students simply do not possess before entering the workforce.
In addition, members of the Harvard Corporation and the Board of Overseers, the University’s highest and second-highest governing body, respectively, are better positioned to bring a clearer look at the issues that Harvard will face in its future. While students’ experiences should be a critical consideration, the individual chosen to lead this University will also be tasked with issues of fundraising, overseeing the expansion into Allston, and national lobbying efforts that transcend the experience of any student.
That said, student input in selecting the next leader is essential. We wholeheartedly support the appointment of the student advisory committee and we hope that their perspectives carry significant weight in the search. We hope that the input given by advisory committees is actually taken into account—after all, given the secrecy of the process, student concerns could be ignored and few would be the wiser. To that end, we hope that increased transparency will ensure student voices are being heard and their suggestions implemented. The President of Harvard University should serve students, and although having them directly choose the President is not essential, hearing their voices is.

The College is currently reviewing proposals to add a gender-neutral housing option for freshman, according to Director of BGLTQ Student Life Sheehan D. Scarborough ’07.
Speaking at an event Thursday at the Democracy Center, Scarborough said the Freshman Dean’s Office is currently “moving forward with proposals” and will “incorporate the suggestions that students have been making” to the College on gender-neutral freshman housing.
Since 2014, rising sophomores, juniors, and seniors have been able to request gender-neutral living arrangements in the upperclassman Houses. Because the College assigns first-year roommates, however, freshmen seeking gender-neutral housing must contact the BGLTQ Office and the FDO individually to "find what's best," a freshman yard resident dean said last year.
A subsequent joint statement issued by the FDO and the BGLTQ Office did not specify when the change in policy would occur.
“Students and staff from the FDO and the Office of BGLTQ Student Life are currently exploring options for expanding gender-inclusive housing to the first year class,” the statement read.
Also at Thursday's panel, Jessica R. Fournier ’17, Lily M. Velona ’18, Helene Lovett ’20, and Ming Li Wu ’21 discussed gender identity at Harvard and spoke about challenges stemming from the current housing policy, as well as other relevant policies at the College.
Panelists said that despite administrative efforts aimed at supporting students of all gender identities, there is still progress to be made.
“No University documents that have my gender have my gender correctly,” Velona said.  “[During] any trip to any bureaucratic office, especially as someone who is lucky to pass [as female] really easily, it’s just never brought up.”
Lovett mentioned that on-campus housing in particular presents a set of challenges for students who do not identify as male or female.
“You basically have to out yourself on the first form you fill in coming to college. It forces us to have this weird, personal, invasive meeting with the Freshman Dean’s Office… hopefully we’ll make progress on that soon,” Lovett said.
Scarborough also spoke about the pace of change on BGLTQ issues at the College and his excitement about recent progress.
“It’s interesting seeing how long things can take, especially at an institution as old and as centralized at Harvard. When you get that moment when something seems to be changing, you kind of hold on to it,” Scarborough said.
The panelists emphasized the importance of being sensitive to pronouns and other gender-specific language.
“Gendered language is such a part of everyday life. To use someone’s pronouns is a way of acknowledging them as a person,” Fournier said.
Wu also spoke about the process of exploring gender identity.
“Some days I feel more feminine, some days I feel more masculine. Some days I want to wear clothes more traditionally associated with men, and some I don’t,” Wu said. “Everyone goes through this, for some people it’s just bigger changes. I’m at a place right now where I’m okay with my identity changing, cause I think that’s just a natural part of life—your identity will fluctuate, you’re not a static person.”

University President Drew G. Faust’s Chief of Staff Lars P. K. Madsen submitted evidence earlier this month supporting a legal challenge to President Donald Trump’s decision to end a program protecting undocumented youth.
Attorneys General from 15 states and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit in a New York district court on Sept. 6, arguing that the Trump administration’s move to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program was unconstitutional and would harm their respective states. DACA, put in place by former President Barack Obama in 2012, provides work authorizations and temporary protected status to qualifying undocumented youth. Trump announced Sept. 5 that he would end the program after a six-month delay.
The lawsuit cites Madsen’s four-page declaration to make the case that ending DACA will hurt  Massachusetts, one of the states that brought the suit.
“Rescinding DACA will harm the ability of Massachusetts colleges and universities,including public universities, to satisfy their educational missions and prepare Massachusetts residents for the workforce,” it argues. “The nation’s leading private universities—many of which are located in Massachusetts will suffer similar harms if DACA is rescinded.”
More than 50 Harvard students are DACA recipients, according to Madsen’s declaration. DACA allows students to work on campus and between terms, travel outside of the United States, and frees them from fear of deportation, Madsen wrote.
“In the absence of a legislative response, discontinuance of DACA will withdraw important work and travel opportunities from DACA students and reintroduce fear and uncertainty into their lives, with real follow-on effects for their education,” he wrote. “In keeping with its central mission — to teach, to advance and promote learning: ‘all good literature, arts and sciences’ for the benefit of all — Harvard therefore stands against the elimination of the DACA program.”
The suit calls on the court to invalidate parts of the Department of Homeland Security memo ending DACA and asks the court to prohibit the federal government from sharing DACA recipients’ information with immigration enforcement authorities.
This is not the first time Harvard has backed legal action against Trump policies. The University and the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Law Clinic submitted several amicus briefs against Trump’s travel ban earlier this year, similarly arguing that those restrictions imperiled the University’s educational mission.
“We’ve just been looking for the ways we can engage with the legal actions undertaken to push back against these measures,” Faust said in an interview Wednesday.
Faust, a vocal DACA supporter, swiftly denounced Trump’s decision to end the program after his announcement and called for a legislative solution. Faust has lobbied Congress to pass laws protecting undocumented youth for years. S, and since Trump’s election, she has sent two letters imploring him to preserve the DACA program. The University has also hired a fellow for undocumented students, brought lawyers to campus to provide legal counsel, and circulated memos providing guidance to students.
Under the Department of Homeland Security guidelines, current DACA recipients whose documents expire on or before March 5 can apply for renewal before Oct. 5.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Hurricane Maria crashed into Puerto Rico on the morning of Sept. 20, Agustin A. Rodriguez Lopez ’19 could only group together with other Puerto Rican students on campus and wait.
Whipping the island with 150 mph winds and flooding the streets, the hurricane knocked out 80 percent of the island’s power transmission lines and cut off students’ hopes of communicating with family members. A Category 4 hurricane, Maria made landfall as the strongest storm to hit Puerto Rico in 80 years. The storm has already caused billions of dollars in damages and left the island in disarray as islanders attempt to rebuild.
“You almost feel powerless because for the first few hours you can’t do anything,” Rodriguez Lopez said. “Even though there is a big Puerto Rican community here, it can also feel completely isolating knowing you can’t reach your family.”
Rafael G. Escalera ’19 said that he has been texting his family in Puerto Rico constantly in the past week. He said that the storm winds were strong enough to rip storm shutters from his family’s apartment and cause supply shortages after the storm, leading to long lines at the gas station and grocery store.
“It’s just desperation. It’s incredibly frustrating if you look at the pictures on the internet and you recognize the places,” Escalera said. “This is where I bike. This is where I used to drive through to get to school. This is where my friend’s house is. Suddenly it doesn’t have a roof on it, and the street in front of it is like a river.”
Hurricane Maria came on the heels of Hurricane Irma, which left 1 million people in the region without electricity. Rodrigo E. Cordova ’19 said that his family regained power on September 19, but lost it when Maria made landfall the next day. That night, Cordova frantically texted Puerto Rican students at Harvard to finds strategies for communicating back home, all while trying to finish his homework.
“Late at night on Wednesday, we were all just freaking out to see if we can contact anyone,” Cordova said. “At that point we were not doing anything and we started to text each other. Every conversation started with ‘What have you heard?’ and ‘Is your family ok?’ We were trying to rally around each other and be with each other.”
After Hurricane Maria made landfall, the island’s struggled to distribute aid effectively. To prevent looting during the crisis, Puerto Rico governor Ricardo Rossello issued a strict dusk-to-dawn curfew. Norman R. Storer '19 said that his parents described the atmosphere as akin to a war zone, with fuel distributed in military convoys and the National Guard patrolling gas stations with assault rifles.
As Puerto Rican residents rebuild, many have criticized the federal government for being slow to respond to the disaster.
“People on the island feel kind of forgotten,” Rodriguez Lopez said. “As frustrating it may be to see the lack of impetus in Congress and the federal government to approve potentially life saving emergency funding, it's not unsurprising.”
Students on campus have now turned their focus to fundraising for disaster relief. According to Rodriguez Lopez, La Organización de Puertorriqueños, a student group at Harvard, is trying to organize a donation drive this week. College students across the nation, including Harvard, have started a GoFundMe to raise money for victims of the storm, which has raised over $120,000 as of Thursday night.
“People are dying because they are not getting resources on time,” Cordova said. “It’s been hard the last couple weeks; we’re trying to do everything we can to make it better and any help students can provide would be immensely appreciated.”
Monica E. Reichard ’19, an inactive Crimson News editor, said that her family was without electricity and water as of Tuesday night. While Reichard has been distributing fundraising information to Harvard undergraduates, she said she is worried about the rebuilding and aftermath of the hurricane.
“I think it’s kind of a humanitarian crisis at best right now,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Kaju Tofu House, a Harvard Square favorite serving spicy Korean fare, closed its doors to student dismay Wednesday evening.
The restaurant posted a sign on its door announcing that Sept. 27 would be its last day in business, as well as a map directing customers to its planned upcoming location in Boston’s Kenmore Square.
Students reacted with shock and sadness as they wondered where in the Square they would be able to fill their cravings for spicy tofu stew or Korean bulgogi.
Michael L. He ’18 said he coincidentally went to Kaju—which he said he has frequented every two or three weeks since freshman year—Wednesday evening, the restaurant’s last day.
“Yesterday I had a sudden urge to eat Kaju and I went with a friend, and on the door it said that it was moving to Kenmore Square starting after that night,” he said. “I was honestly very shocked because Kaju always has really great business, so I didn’t think it would ever decide to move.”
Apurva Kanneganti ’20 said she was similarly disappointed to find out Kaju was closing, especially since she didn’t have time to go there for a last meal.
“I was very shocked and unhappy, simply because it was really sudden,” she said. “I didn’t even have a chance really to go and eat there before they closed.”
The restaurant was located on the second floor of Crimson Galeria, the pedestrian mall at 57 JFK St. In early July, Wagamama, a Japanese noodle chain, closed its doors one floor down from Kaju to focus efforts on its other Boston outlets. Raj K. Dhanda, owner of Crimson Galeria, declined to comment.
Hannah Shen ’19 said that as an Eliot House resident, she often went across the street to Kaju when she didn’t want to eat in the dining hall.
“I used to go to Kaju all the time,” Shen said. “It’s one of my favorite restaurants in the Square. I love their food and I enjoy eating there by myself and also with friends.”
Both Kanneganti and He said they patronized Kaju for its unique spicy food.
“I really just loved that they have actually spicy tofu silk,” Kanneganti said. “I would always get the extra spicy. Kaju was the one reason my spice tolerance remained high here.”
Shen said she may go to the new Kenmore Square location to celebrate birthdays or special occasions, but will miss having Kaju around.
“It’s sad because I like the waiters and waitresses there,” she added. “They probably don’t know me but I’ll miss seeing them around.”

The School of Engineering and Applied Sciences has hired six new faculty members, the largest addition to the school’s faculty since SEAS hired a “bumper crop” of eight professors in 2015.
Bolstered by a record-breaking gift and rapidly growing undergraduate enrollment, SEAS has sought to expand its faculty in recent years. Ahead of the school’s move to a $1 billion campus in Allston, however, space constraints at its current accommodations have at times hampered growth.
“The dean authorizes a series of searches for new faculty based on where we have the highest needs in terms of supporting teaching of courses and in terms of complementing research programs of faculty already here,” said SEAS spokesperson Paul Karoff.
Assistant Professor of Electrical Engineering Flavio P. Clamon—a new hire who previously worked at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center—said he hopes to encourage his engineering students to consider the social impact of their work.
“It’s more important now than ever they are a part of this debate, and informed about the impact of their work,” Clamon said.
Clamon is joined by new faculty hires Minlan Yu, Boris Kozinsky, Prineha Narang,  Susan A. Murphy, and Samir Mitragotri.
Yu, a computer scientist, said she is coming to Harvard will enable her to pursue “richer collaboration” with Harvard’s Computer Science faculty and with researchers in industry and at other schools in the Boston.
Kozinsky—now an Associate Professor of Computational Materials Science—said he is looking forward to sharing his experiences in industrial research with students. While he is excited to collaborate with “fantastic experimentalists and theorists” at Harvard, he said, he hopes to remain close to “practically-relevant technological problems.”
Narang, also an Associate Professor of Computational Materials Science, said she was drawn to SEAS’s “wonderful no-department way of operation.” SEAS describes its organization as non-departmental, instead using broadly-constituted “teaching areas” to classify professors.
Last academic year, SEAS had 943 concentrators, which accounts for 19 percent of college undergraduates. By comparison, there were 291 undergraduate concentrators in SEAS in the 2007-2008 academic year.
Former Microsoft CEO Steven A. Ballmer ’77 increased the school’s hiring capacity with a large donation in Nov. 2014 to fund 12 computer science professorships. SEAS has so far named five faculty chairs as a result of this gift, according to Karoff.
While Ballmer’s gift and hedge fund magnate John A. Paulson’s record-setting $450 million gift in 2015 have increased the school’s financial capacity to hire, space constraints remain a factor in hiring decisions.
“It may in some cases introduce a bias towards towards theoreticians over experimentalists, but several of this year’s new hires are experimental scientists,” Karoff said. “The biggest factor is where we need to strengthen our cadre of faculty.”
In the fall 2020, much of SEAS will relocate to the new complex in Allston.
“We’ll have a little relief from the space constraint when Allston opens in 2020, but until then, we have to be creative with our real estate,” Karoff said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An increasingly global economy doesn’t have to mean the collapse of social institutions within countries, Kennedy School professor and economist Dani Rodrik ’79 argued in a talk held by the Safra Center for Ethics Thursday evening.
Introducing Rodrik, Danielle S. Allen—a Government professor and the director of the Safra Center— emphasized how Rodrik is particularly keen on asking both political and economic questions.
In his lecture, Rodrik outlined the hypothetical tension between economic globalization and democracy using a thought experiment involving two businessmen, one of whom out-competed the other. Rodrik then offered five potential reasons for the businessman’s success.
In one hypothetical, the imaginary businessman brought Bangladeshi workers to the United States—but treated them in a way consistent with Bangladeshi, rather than U.S., labor regulations. Rodrik sought to illustrate how global trade can undermine domestic social norms: while Americans do not bat an eye at buying goods from Bangladesh, he said, they would be outraged if mistreated workers lived in the United States.
“If we are making decisions over these things, it should be decisions that are made openly, and discussed and deliberated,” Rodrik said. “It should be in this form that we are discussing these conditions about what are the gains from trade versus what does it do to our own institutions.”
Rodrik argued that there should be limits to economic globalization, advocating for a “globalization without globalism” that preserves social contracts within countries.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Education Secretary Betsy DeVos’s appearance at the Harvard Kennedy School Thursday met vocal protest from hundreds of demonstrators gathered outside—and silent disapproval from students indoors, many of them hoisting banners made from bedsheets.
DeVos visited campus to talk with students and invited guests in a forum titled “A conversation on empowering parents” hosted by the Institute of Politics. During the hour-long event, the President Donald Trump appointee gave a brief talk and answered questions from the roughly 100 attendees, most of them Harvard students.
She faced repeated interruptions. With shouts from the hundreds-strong crowd outside—“Education is a right, not just for the rich and white!”—echoing in the brightly lit John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum, protesters in the audience periodically stood and silently unveiled large posters.
“WHITE SUPREMACIST,” read one, drawn in red paint on white linen. “OUR STUDENTS ARE NOT 4 SALE,” read another.
DeVos fought to keep the attention of the room. Kennedy School Academic Dean Archon Fung introduced DeVos, calling her a “special guest” and warning the room he would ask Harvard police to “escort from the forum” anyone who prevented DeVos from speaking.
In remarks that lasted for roughly 20 minutes, DeVos argued for “school choice,” a movement she champions that seeks to develop alternatives to public schools. She steered clear of her recent, controversial decision to rescind Obama-era Title IX guidelines that stipulated that schools must use a lower standard of proof when judging whether an accused student is guilty of sexual assault.
“Our children are 100 percent of our future, they deserve 100 percent of our effort,” she said. “The biggest barrier to education is lack of ability to choose.”
Afterwards, audience members queued behind microphones placed around the room to ask question.
Harvard Republican Club President Kent Haeffner ’18 asked about the proper role of the federal government in educational policymaking. Someone else asked what DeVos thought her “greatest accomplishments” were in office to date.
As attendees watched the students unroll posters, scattered audience members began to press and lampoon the secretary.
After one questioner said, “I’m going to assume you have good intentions,” someone in the room quipped, “That’s a stretch,” prompting many to break into cheers, applause, and whistles.
Then—as roughly two dozen police looked on, patrolling the forum in full gear—the questions became more pointed.
One woman, who said she works as an educator, stood and told DeVos the Trump administration has been removing “tools” from the “tool box” of ways teachers can protect students’ safety. She specifically referenced DeVos’s move to rescind the Obama-era Title IX guidelines, as well as the secretary’s June decision to rewrite the rules outlining bathroom access for transgender students.
She asked DeVos for a path forward that ensures students keep “safe in school.”
DeVos replied that the “whole legal history” on the transgender bathroom is “very complicated.”
“Let’s just say that, with respect to any student that feels unsafe or discriminated against in their school, that is the last thing we want,” she said. “[And] campus sexual assault is not an issue that we’re going to be sweeping under the rug—I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, one sexual assault is one too many.”
Outside, surrounded by police with dogs, demonstrators continued to chant. Harvard students and Bostonians took turns addressing the crowd behind a large microphone. At one point, mayoral candidate Tito Jackson stopped by and urged DeVos to “go right back to Washington.”
At 7 p.m. exactly, Fung started wrapping up the discussion.
“I’ve been to a lot of forums,” he said. “At this forum, there has been the most strongly held and widely held set of views that I have experienced… Conversations like we’ve just had are very, very difficult.”
“I think we did a reasonable and good job of allowing this exchange,” Fung added.
DeVos rose from her seat, smiled, and began walking out. As she exited, the protesters—silent throughout the event—pointed at the secretary and unanimously started chanting.
“What does white supremacy look like?” they shouted. “That’s what white supremacy looks like!”
Thursday’s protest marked the second time in two weeks that the Institute of Politics has courted controversy and drawn protest with its invited speakers. On Sept. 15, the Kennedy School rescinded an invitation for Chelsea Manning to serve as a visiting fellow at the Institute after top current and former CIA officials denounced the decision.

Juniors Adam Scott and Wes Ogsbury dance on the football field. Scott, a 5’7” wide receiver for Harvard, sometimes lines up across from Ogsbury, a 5’11” cornerback, at practice. Scott cuts one way, and Ogsbury follows. Movement and response.
The more serious dancing, however, takes place without pads. The nimble duo has performed routines across campus—beneath Leverett Library, on Weeks Footbridge, in front of Widener Library, and in the Harvard Square T station. They’re ridiculously skilled, fluid and fast. A third teammate, junior cornerback Tyler Gray, records with a camera.
These dance sessions pop up on YouTube under an itching-to-go-viral tagline: “Harvard Hits.” The name, Scott explains, is a multilayered pun. A “hit” is something that’s “cool, it’s dope.” But “hits” is also a kind of dance that involves jabs on hard beats. And then there’s the football connotation.
“From the outside world, to many people, Harvard is just a place that’s boring,” Scott said. “This is a platform to show people that Harvard is not only a place of high academic standards but also for hits.”
Scott and Ogsbury are smooth operators. They toy with gravity and time. Limbs become liquid. Air becomes solid. When asked to name the better dancer, Gray gave a sly smile. “No comment,” he said.
And the videos—well, they’re fun to watch. Scott and Ogsbury strut in front of the camera, typically in the middle of broad daylight. Pedestrians walk past. The dancers swivel their feet, roll their shoulders, and thrust their hips.
The scene exudes energy and charisma. Afternoon sunlight fills the screen. These videos belong to hip-hop culture, and you can feel the joy.
Dance, race, and music. Music, race, and dance. The three weave together in complex ways. And Harvard football, a program that loves both playlists and dance moves, is home to many identities.
There are Southern conservatives, Northern liberals, and many players who fit in neither category. More to the point, there are stone-cut defensive ends who listen to alternative rock and lithe wide receivers who blast gospel songs.
The Crimson has struck an impromptu agreement about locker room music. Mostly, it’s first-come, first-served, but Tuesday marks an exception. That day, country lovers take over the AUX as part of “Texas Tuesday.” Clearly, the playlist caters to a certain identity—often white, Southern, and conservative. But categories aren’t so simple. Scott, for example, is a Christian from Denton, Texas, but he prefers hip-hop.
“When they play country in the locker room, we don’t get mad,” Scott said. “We’re a team, so we have to respect that.”
A focus on unity pervades the program’s approach to issues of race and identity. Last week, NFL stadiums became arenas for activism when scores of players knelt down, locked arms, or vacated the sidelines during the national anthem. These protests sparked debates that reached Cambridge, Mass.
On Tuesday, Harvard coach Tim Murphy had a conversation with his team about the many protests. He slammed “neo-Nazis and white supremacists” but emphasized the importance of seeking internal agreement.
“We have a lot of guys from a lot of different backgrounds and with different views,” Gray said. “Even if we don’t agree on something...we try to make it unified. We don’t want any look of division in the team because it’s not [the case].”
Harvard Hits fits into this notion. Scott first learned to dance in church; his mom later signed him up for hip-hop lessons. In part, he and Ogsbury got the idea for the videos after people suggested that the pair looked like Ayo and Teo, a well-known dancing tandem. In this way, Harvard Hits reflects Scott—his background and personality.
“Harvard Hits is also a platform for minority students,” Scott said. “Before I came, I didn’t really know if I was going to have a space at Harvard. This is basically showing that there is a space for you and hip-hop dancing. You’re going to be accepted.”
Yet Scott and Ogsbury have tried to open Harvard Hits to broader communities. On the defensive back’s suggestion, the pair filmed a dance for “Closer” by The Chainsmokers, reasoning that the song would appeal to a different crowd.
So far, Harvard Hits has generated modest interest, with the most popular video topping 1,000 views. Cameraman Gray sees a potential for rapid growth.
“We’re waiting on one video to go viral,”  Gray said, smiling again. “I think that it’ll blow up pretty soon.”

The Harvard football seniors have absorbed many hits—tackles, blocks, and collisions with the ground. Nothing compares to the emotional pounding.
On Nov. 11, 2016, these seniors—then juniors—traveled to Penn in hopes of avenging a 2015 loss and earning a fourth-straight league championship. The Quakers quashed that dream with a two-minute drill and a 27-14 victory.
Sometimes noise deafens. At that post-game press conference, amid the smell of sweat, silence deafened. Soon-to-graduate defensive linemen James Duberg ’16 and Langston Ward ’16 stared from behind a table. Memories of the last three hours played on the back wall.
That Penn setback, however, ranked as only the third-most difficult experience that 2017 seniors have endured.
The next weekend, the Crimson dropped The Game—not just any version of The Game but a one-score home loss that would have given Harvard an Ivy four-peat and extended a nine-game win streak over Yale. The Bulldogs, by the way, owned a 2-7 record and started a rookie quarterback.
The upset set off weeks of second-guessing. The reckoning still hasn’t ended—and won’t until Nov. 18, 2017, when the two teams meet again.
“We didn’t play with the emotion that’s so typical of a Harvard team—and a Harvard-Yale game in particular,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “Those things really bugged me.”
But the Penn and Yale heartbreaks seem trivial compared to the real-life tragedy that unfolded on Sept. 16. In a game against Rhode Island, defensive back Ben Abercrombie rammed into a wide receiver and suffered a major cervical injury. As of Wednesday, the freshman remains in a Rhode Island hospital, paralyzed below the neck. His prognosis is uncertain.
Crimson seniors shoulder these events. They shoulder the pain along with the normal burdens of Harvard football—the early-morning workouts, the long bus rides, the inevitable injuries, the relentless academics, the fatigue, the sense of isolation, the cold, the wind, the sniping of lesser opponents, the rivalry of better ones, the internal expectations, and the private doubts.
People talk about “swirling emotions,” but that phrase is wrong. Emotions aren’t nearly so nimble. They don’t swirl. They tumble and tug, like a stone boulder. It takes a strong person to stay upright—and stronger still to convert that grinding, rolling, kinetic energy into something lighter.
“It’s not just emotion on Saturdays,” captain Luke Hutton said after an exhausting win over Brown—exhausting because of Abercrombie’s absence. “It’s emotion throughout the week and in game-planning. It’s emotion put into execution throughout the week. You don’t just win a game based on emotion. You win a game because you outwork the other person. You put emotion towards a game plan.”
This season, the game plan is resurgence. The Crimson hopes to overcome a season-opening defeat to the Rams and regain the Ancient Eight crown.
Harvard’s strength lies in its defense. The senior Hutton leads a linebacker corps that, although thin, boasts experienced first-stringers. The same holds for the secondary, where junior Wes Ogsbury and seniors Tanner Lee, Tim Haehl, and Raishaun McGhee project as long-term starters. The depth chart clouds when considering defensive linemen, but junior D.J. Bailey remains a constant. Last season, he terrorized opponents for seven sacks. He, Hutton, and McGhee all landed on the All-Ivy second team and returned this season.
The Crimson defense has proven inconsistent, however. Against Brown, Harvard looked otherworldly, shutting out the offense through three quarters—at which point Murphy yanked the starters. In 15 minutes, the Bears scored 26 points and racked up 232 passing yards.
Against Rhode Island, the Crimson shut out the Rams in the second half. But wide receivers snuck behind cornerbacks for catches of 51, 39, 33, and 41 yards.
“You’ve got to play great defense,” Murphy said. “And you’ve got to have an offense that’s capable of capitalizing on the opportunities that come their way.”
Meanwhile, Joe Viviano and Jake Smith are battling at the quarterback position. The two share few similarities. Viviano, a fifth-year senior from Berwyn, Pa., started all last year. He’s a 6’4” cannon with spry mobility but sometimes struggles with accuracy.
Smith seems much smaller—smaller even than his 6’0” listing on the Harvard roster. At Ithaca High School in Michigan, the quarterback set school rushing records with 1,772 rushing yards and 34 touchdowns. Now a true freshman, Smith makes quick decisions and has a delicate touch. But again, he is a true freshman.
Last week marked the first public competition between the pair. Smith started against Brown and finished five-of-seven for 72 yards. Viviano looked even sharper. He entered in the second quarter, immediately led a 98-yard drive, and totaled 150 passing yards on 11-of-13 throwing.
Murphy alone will make the final determination, likely in the next two weeks. He’s not revealing his cards.
“My goal is to have three quality quarterbacks in the program by mid-year,” Murphy said. “I think we’re on course to do that…. Right now, it’s a very good competition.”
Whoever wins the quarterback competition will inherit dangerous playmakers. Junior wide receiver Justice Shelton-Mosley has landed on the All-Ivy first team for two years in a row. The Sacramento, Calif., native also returns punts and kicks.
Blockmate Adam Scott, a fellow junior and wide receiver, is even faster than Shelton-Mosley. After missing the first five games of the season, Scott racked up 321 yards and three scores in 2016.
If the pass game ever breaks down, the Crimson can hand off the ball to junior Charlie Booker III, a monster truck disguised as a man. In two weekends, the rusher has rumbled for 216 yards at a clip of 8.3 yards per go.
Look at these studs alone, and Harvard’s success seems as sure as sunrise. Look at the rest of the Ancient Eight, and clouds begin to gather.
In August, media pundits projected Princeton to finish tied with the Crimson atop the Ivy League. Like Harvard, the Tigers oscillate between two quarterbacks when healthy. In 2016, senior John Lovett headlined as the Ancient Eight Offensive Player of the Year. He accounted for 31 touchdowns a year ago, which was more than five of the other seven Ivy squads scored all season.
However, an unspecified offseason injury will keep Lovett out until the middle of the season, which means that fellow quarterback Chad Kanoff will lead the offense. Last year, the then-junior merely landed on the All-Ivy second team. He’s a traditional passer with two seasons of starting experience.
The road extends beyond Princeton, N.J., though. The Quakers won a share of last year’s crown, largely thanks to the triumph over the Crimson. Penn returns all-world wide receiver Justin Watson. The senior Watson averaged 111.5 receiving yards per contest last year. He is, quite frankly, the most talented player that the Ivy League has seen in several years.
Even Yale and Dartmouth will threaten Harvard. Both teams have started 2-0, with the Bulldogs averaging 52.5 points and the Big Green holding opponents to an average of 16.5.
Brown, Columbia, and Cornell project as cellar-dwellers. Still, all teams have competitive potential, even the Lions. With Al Bagnoli as coach of Columbia, the Lions are continuing their trek up Mount Pride. The Crimson can expect a tough game in November.
As Murphy emphasizes, the quality of a football team hinges on uncontrollable factors—practice injuries and rainy turnovers, not to mention the sheer randomness that hovers over every snap.
“Our relative depth is a concern,” Murphy said. “You’ve got to stay healthy. We’ve got 12 freshmen making a road trip, and it’s only game three.”
Even so, talent matters, experience matters, and discipline matters. The 2017 Harvard team ranks well in all categories. Football plays barely last longer than this sentence, but make no mistake—the sport requires endurance. Crimson seniors know that.
They’ve withstood so much. They’ve continued. And they still have so much to accomplish.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Is that a freshman playing?” could be heard multiple times on the sidelines of the Harvard men’s soccer team’s home opener on Sept. 1, as several of the team’s newest members either started or were substituted into the game. It has been clear from the start of the season that Harvard (1-5-1) has a talented set of freshmen—one of the strongest classes in program history.
This strength can be attributed, in part, to the atypical pre-college experiences of some of the players. While many student athletes dream of playing for professional or national teams after graduation, midfielder/forward Paolo Belloni-Urso and midfielder Cornelius Bencsik have already done so.
Belloni-Urso has had quite the international soccer career, playing for clubs in three countries.
“Overall, I’ve gotten different experiences in different ways of playing because I’ve played on...different teams,” Belloni-Urso said. “So I’ve learned from playing in different countries and with different people, their perspectives.”
Prior to his arrival at Harvard, the midfielder played for youth clubs in his native Honduras before moving to Florida. During his time there, Belloni-Urso attracted interest from the national level. In 2013, he was invited to the U.S. U14 national team’s training camp.
Bellon-Urso then caught the eye of Genoa F.C., a club in Italy’s Serie A league, where he would spend the next few years playing on the youth team. He captained the U16 and U17 teams, and helped his team win four Serie A national championships.
Bellon-Urso was named to the Honduran U17 team before making the American U18 team, for which he played in the Slovakia Cup earlier this year.
While his now-teammate was in Slovakia, Bencsik was about 1,000 miles away making a name for himself in Norway’s professional league. The midfielder began to notice he had natural talent at a young age.
“I was always playing soccer by myself and with friends, all day, every day,” Bencsik said. “I figured out I was pretty good when I was around 10 or 11 years old.”
He joined his hometown of Brumunddal’s youth team, where he garnered enough attention to be offered a spot on the youth team at Stabaek. In 2013, he moved away from home to play for Stabaek and attend the Norwegian College of Elite Sport.
During his three years with Stabaek, the Norwegian, known to his teammates as “Coco,” helped his team win Junior Interkrets Oslo/Akershus four years in a row and take second place in the Norwegian Cup.
At age 17, Bencsik was called up to the senior A team, and made his Tippeligaen (now Eliteserien) debut in the team’s match against Aalesund. The next year, though, Bencsik made the B team, and decided to play for Asker. After a few months there, he joined A team, for which he has played for the past year.
It might be surprising that both players can be seen on the Harvard pitch now, and are not continuing on the international professional circuit. At one point, Belloni-Urso was thought to be following in the footsteps of former Genoa and current A.S. Roma player Stephan El Shaarawy, who also began his career playing for Genoa’s youth team. Belloni-Urso had a bit of a change of heart, though, during the past season with Genoa.
“In Genoa, a lot of my teammates didn’t go to school, and being in that environment, I realized that it wasn’t what I wanted—it wasn’t the person I wanted to become,” Belloni-Urso said.
Belloni-Urso declined an invitation to play for Honduras’ U20 team at the U20 World Cup and decided to join Harvard’s team instead.
Bencsik, who was also performing well in the classroom, started to consider other options as well. An opportunity came knocking in the form of a Facebook message from Harvard coach Pieter Lehrer.
“I just decided to go for it because I could go to Harvard, which is an excellent academic school, and play soccer at the same time,” Bencsik said.
The Honduran remains a member of the Genoa squad, while the Norwegian is a free agent. But for now, their focus is on adjusting to collegiate play, something which both acknowledge is quite different from what they are used to.
“The environment around is really good, with the professionalism around the team, and the environment within the team is really good.” Bencsik said.
“Coming here to Harvard, and seeing new ideas and new ways of playing...it’s just a combination of learning different styles and trying to adapt to what the best one is,” Belloni-Urso added. “Playing with a different background and, of course, with people from different nationalities, everyone brings their own perspective and we just work on trying to condense everything into one style of player, one idea in order for the team to benefit.”
It’s almost midway through the season now, and the duo has adapted well. Both players have scored their first goals for Harvard, and Belloni-Urso was named Ivy League Rookie of the Week. They will surely be using their respective experiences to make the most of their Crimson careers for the next four years, both on and off the field.

The start of the season for Harvard men’s soccer has been disappointing.
Winless at home and playing with sparse crowd support, the team has all of the individual talent but has struggled to find its form. The Crimson (1-5-1) has not pieced together consistent performances, often controlling the point of attack, but a few minutes later backing down under siege. For its flashes of brilliance, Harvard has failed to find the back of the net very often.
“I think approaching the Ivy Leagues, we just need to make sure that we are working hard and working together for 90 minutes, and we’ll get the results that we want,” co-captain Justin Crichlow said.
But the Crimson’s season is far from lost.
When Ivy League competition commences this weekend in New Haven, Harvard will hit a reset switch on its season. After securing a winning conference record for each of the past four seasons, the Crimson will look to finally lock up its first Ivy League championship since 2009 and grant fifth-year coach Pieter Lehrer the first NCAA Tournament appearance of his tenure.
The team’s previous results will not matter if the Crimson is able to come out on top of the Ivy League. Harvard has tried to use this non-conference slate to become more cohesive and discover its weaknesses.
“We have a lot of room to improve,” said freshman midfielder/forward Paolo Belloni-Urso. “I think that once the Ivy League starts, we’ll be good enough to get a good start, and actually start getting the results we want. So we’re kind of using these first games to get better, to understand ourselves as a team, and also to create a style of play that we can all prosper in.”
With a very young team—the team’s top four goal and points leaders are all underclassmen—growing pains should be expected. The Crimson has only scored four goals in seven games and opponents have been outscoring the team by more than a goal on average. The key going forward will be for the whole team to come together, although it may find leadership from unconventional sources.
“As a player myself, I’m trying to have a bigger impact on the team, and also in a way to have other players, my other teammates, have bigger impacts themselves. So trying to be a leader on the field as well as off the field,” Belloni said.
This may seem strange from an athlete who has only been on the team for a couple months, but this mentality is all part of the team’s emphasis on “collective leadership” and the willingness to take contributions from any source.
“Second half of the season, we are definitely looking for players to just step up and become leaders on the team,” Crichlow said. “We’re a very young team so we need guys to take leadership, not just for themselves, but also for the guys around them.”
This openness to younger leadership will help bring continuity to the team far into the future. But for now, Harvard will be looking to win through any means.
The Crimson begins its Ancient Eight schedule with a duel against Yale in enemy territory. The game will mark the unofficial transition from summer competition to fall football. As the weather gets colder, the play will become feistier.
“The Ivy League games are always fought with a lot of grit,” Crichlow said. “Every team fights tooth and nail to beat us and it’s typically a lot more physical.”
This first game against Yale will serve to set the tone as the team goes down the stretch, both form-wise and emotionally.
“Yale’s the first Ivy League team that we are looking to and they always play their best game against us,” Crichlow said. “I think that it is the Harvard-Yale tradition that fires them up, and it fires us up, too.”
The game against the Bulldogs could let loose the winning bug and bring the rest of the league to attention. As the Crimson looks to reclaim the elusive Ivy title, it must confront three-time defending champion Dartmouth in a key late October home contest. Harvard won last year by scoring the only goal of the game in Hanover, but both teams have very different rosters than the ones they jogged out a season ago. If the Crimson doesn’t step up between now and then, the game could be about nothing but pride.
Once conference play starts, the team will play an Ivy League team every weekend, which is a significant departure from early in the season when it was common to play every three or four days. The Ancient Eight schedule gives Harvard the opportunity to set up specific schemes and make tactical changes during the week.
“With three games in a week, it’s grueling during the week, but it actually makes us fit and ready to play 90 minutes, 120 minutes if we need to go play overtime,” Crichlow said.
The team has the necessary tools for success. The big question over the coming month will be how well the players can assemble them into a winning unit.

Harvard football players pile onto a charter bus, getting settled in after a hard-fought win. Before long, not even the bus driver can implore the group to quiet down, as the team’s raucous celebration completely drowns out his voice.
All of a sudden, a group breaks out into song: the members of Protein Shake, a rock band from the 2015 team, used to provide some of the entertainment for the long journey back to Cambridge. Now the current offensive linemen carry on the tradition.
“Some of the great offensive line group we had together at one time, all those NFLers, the guys like Adam Redmond, [Anthony] Fabiano, Cole Toner, Ben Braunecker, those guys used to sing,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “You could tell they had practiced, and it was just so soothing, so calming, so entertaining. You have to have sort of a quirky sense of pride to do it, and a sense of humor, but at the same time they were really good.”
“We have some guys this year that like to sing on the bus,” senior halfback Ryan Antonellis added. “They’re not as good, but there are definitely some characters on the O-line. Guys that like to sing and yell, and, for better or worse, they just kind of do it.”
These are just a few snippets from a typical return trip for the Crimson football team. Typical in the sense that, since 2013, Harvard has only suffered three road defeats.
Adding to the win column is generally thought to be more difficult as the visiting team. Crimson football, either by chance or by some rare gift to win on the road, has broken this pattern in recent years. From 2013 to 2015, Harvard did not suffer a single loss as the away squad.
“Having a special sort of sense of pride in being ‘road warriors’ is a big thing with us,” Murphy said. “We know it’s harder. We know it’s relatively hostile territory. And we know that statistically speaking, it’s harder to do so we embrace that challenge.”
Road experiences for the Crimson are not always so positive, however. One of the games that slipped away was the 2012 loss at Princeton, in which the Tigers posted 29 unanswered points in the fourth quarter to take their first lead of the contest with 13 seconds remaining.
Defeats on road trips take on an added feeling of pensiveness and frustration, as the team has the entire journey back home to reflect on what could have been. Murphy offered just one word to describe the atmosphere among the players and coaches following a defeat: silence.
A recent road trip that ended poorly in more ways than one was Harvard’s opening week venture down to the University of Rhode Island. Not only did the Crimson have to swallow an unexpected defeat, but freshman cornerback Ben Abercrombie also suffered a serious neck injury.
“Rhode Island was definitely the quietest bus I’ve ever taken home, just with what happened with Ben and the loss,” Antonellis said. “No one said a word on the way home. It was really solemn.”
More often than not, however, the team does not have to worry about dealing with these negative postgame emotions.
“Honestly, I haven’t lost many road games, so usually [the trips are] fun from what I remember,” said senior defensive back Tim Haehl. “We usually throw on a funny movie or something.”
These trips, especially on the return path, allow the team to let loose and relax after a grueling week of practice, film review, and game action.
Though traveling with teammates serves as an excellent tool to spur team bonding, some players find more comfort at the friendly confines of Harvard Stadium. From Eliot House, the walk over to the Stadium is no more than five minutes at a leisurely pace. From the distant Quad, Allston is still just a short bike ride away.
Five times a year, the team has the luxury of playing at the historic field just a short distance from the players’ dorms. They do not have to plan their entire weekends around an elaborate travel schedule. They do not have to miss Friday classes. They do not have to venture into enemy territory, where a legion of opposing players waits to greet the Crimson’s smaller travel roster.
Five other times, however, the team has to hit the road. Some destinations are an hour or two away, such as non-conference opponents Holy Cross or Rhode Island. Others are much more distant. For example, in 2013, the Crimson took off for California to take on the University of San Diego.
Compared to other Harvard athletic programs with more games on their schedules, the football team’s travel commitment is relatively light. However, it can still be a challenge to balance the weekend schedule with academic commitments.
For Harvard students, classwork never sleeps, and it is very common for professors to require students to turn in assignments on Mondays. This leaves precious little time over the weekend for players to be fully invested in both their athletic and academic obligations.
“You expect to do a lot of work on the bus, catch up on sleep, listen to music, but we always end up watching movies and getting closer as a team,” Antonellis said.
Meals, like the other aspects of the trip, are finely tuned. Players will eat just before departing, and they are provided snacks on the road prepared by the training staff. As soon as they get off the bus or plane, get settled, and finish team meetings, they will have another meal at the hotel.
“When we go to a place like Georgetown, we’re going to be staying in a really nice hotel, and the catering services are amazing there,” Antonellis said. “The food’s definitely way better than HUDS. We always get steak dinners and stuff.”
Unlike the meals, however, not everything always goes according to plan. Antonellis would tell you of a freshman year mishap in which two fellow rookies missed the bus and were left behind. The bus, like everything else around the program, runs on Murphy time: it leaves ten minutes before it is scheduled to depart, and it waits for no straggler.
Haehl cites the cramped visitors’ locker rooms as one distinct negative of being away from the familiar Dillon Field House.
“You have to get taped,” Haehl said. “You have to get all your stuff on. And you’re standing in a four square-foot area with three other guys, and all of your lockers are just boxed in.”
For all the highs and the lows of a football season, all the triumphs and the struggles, all the positives and the negatives, one thing the team can agree on is that victorious road trips are an unmatched experience.
“There’s nothing more fun, and more family-like, and more palpable than a happy bus with a long way to go home,” Murphy remarked.

Following last season’s 12-8 record, which featured an undefeated 7-0 record against Ivy league opponents, the Harvard field hockey team enters the 2017 campaign looking to build on its Ivy League dominance from a season ago.
The team returns 16 members from last season’s Ancient Eight title squad, including sophomore midfielder Bente van Vlijmen. A year after leading the team with eight goals, van Vlijmen has picked up where she left off—scoring four times already to start the season.
Despite the team’s success over the past several seasons, it strives to maintain a sense of humility, treating each game as important as the next and never taking any victory for granted. These sentiments are echoed by team captains Ellie Cookson and Hannah Wellington.
“We never really want to get ahead of ourselves,” Wellington said. “I think that’s what makes us such a great team—the fact that we’re so grounded. Every game is the first step to the bigger prize.”
Coach Tjerk van Herwaarden welcomes seven new freshmen to the roster for this season. On defense, Hannah Pearce, Amy Brooke and Sage Nye join a group known for its fortitude. At midfield, Tessel Huibregtsen and Kolbe Keating join their captains as strong two-way players. In the forward spots, Natalie Sicher and Mimi Tarrant look to provide firepower to Harvard’s already loaded attack. Tarrant, a freshman from Warwickshire, England, has gotten her career off to a great start, scoring four goals and contributing two assists in the team’s opening games.
Van Herwaarden enters his sixth season with the Crimson and seeks to maintain his sustained level of success. Prior to joining the Crimson, he served on the coaching staff at Maryland, where he helped lead the Terrapins to five national championships in seven seasons.
Since moving to Cambridge, he has spearheaded turning Harvard’s field hockey program into a perennial Ivy League contender. The Crimson has posted winning seasons every year since 2013, van Herwaarden’s second year with the team. Most notably, he is the only current coach in the country to win titles in NCAA Division I, USA Field Hockey Women’s High Performance, and the USAFH Men’s National Championship. Despite his decorated resume, van Herwaarden remains humble, a quality which he has instilled into his team.
“Our method is clear,” van Herwaarden said. “We want to take it game by game and approach each game and prepare for whoever the opponent is. The most important game is always the next one.”
After opening the season against a series of non-conference opponents, including then-No. 13 Stanford and No. 2 Connecticut, the Crimson turned its attention to conference play as it took to New Haven this past weekend to face off against Yale. Coming into the weekend’s matchup, Harvard holds a 10-game win streak against Ivy League opponents that dates back to 2015. Against the Bulldogs, the Crimson has won its last five matchups. Coming into this season, the team is hopeful about its chances, but knows that another Ancient Eight title is no guarantee.
“We’re feeling great about Ivy League play,” senior goalkeeper Olivia Startup said. “The Ivy League always plays host to our most exciting games. Really, we’re just looking to play each game as it comes and not look too far forward into the season.”
Last season, Harvard’s biggest threat to the title was Princeton, who finished with a 5-2 record. The Tigers once again look to be the Crimson’s biggest threat, as it returns 18 members from last year’s squad. Harvard and Princeton will face off on October 21 at Berylson Field.
In addition to continuing its success in the Ivy league, the team hopes to improve its performance in the NCAA Tournament after an underwhelming performance last season. After making the tournament, the team lost to No. 3 Syracuse, 5-1, in the first round. While the team may have beaten Princeton in the Ivies, the Crimson had to watch its rival make it all the way to the semifinals before being eliminated by eventual champion Delaware.
“This year we, as always, are shooting to win the Ivies; it’s definitely a great goal for us,” Wellington said. “After that, we would definitely love to get into playoffs and see how far we could advance. I think we don’t have any direct goals per se, but we’re focused on the big pictures while taking it step by step.”

Winning the Ivy League Championship with a loss under one’s belt is difficult—but not impossible.
Over the weekend, the Harvard women’s soccer team (6-4, 0-1 Ivy League) dropped a tough conference opener to Penn, 1-0, and now faces an uphill battle on the path to defending its 2016 league crown.
“We just didn’t get the result we wanted,” senior co-captain Caroline Chagares said of the opening loss. “We know all these Ivy League games are going to be really tough.”
Just how rare is winning the Ancient Eight title with at least one defeat? It occurred fairly recently, actually—the 2014 version of the Crimson went 5-1-1 in conference play and finished atop the leaderboard by virtue of the rest of the league beating up on one another.
That squad was an outlier, however. Dating back to 2011, every other champion had to go undefeated in Ivy League play in order to claim the crown.
That narrative alone, however, tells nothing of the whole story—one loss does not write off a team. After all, making a comeback in the standings it still entirely possible.
“Chances are, nobody’s going to win all the games in the Ivy League this year,” senior co-captain Marie Becker said. “The league has gotten so competitive over the past few years.”
There are six more games to go, and it’s a simple math problem to see how Harvard can make up the ground. Three points for a win, one for a tie, and zero for a loss. Winning out can give the Crimson an even higher game-point total (18) than it had last year (17) when it captured the title.
“There was some disappointment after the loss on Saturday, but we mentally bounce back really well afterwards,” Becker said. “Now we have to make the best out of the situation and stay positive.”
Harvard hasn’t lost twice in a row this season, which is a good sign for a team looking to rebound. Of course, moving forward, the Crimson will need some luck, some help from the competition, and a lot more goals.
All year long, Harvard has been a defensive juggernaut, anchoring a veteran backline with a pair of platooning goalies that can make spectacular saves. Junior Danielle Etzel and sophomore Kat Hess have logged almost identical times between the pipes this season. The former has played 464:57 in net, while the latter has spent 454:43 there.
The problem, however, has been generating offense. The struggles of the attack become apparent when the Crimson starts playing from behind. When its opponent scores first, Harvard is 0-4 this season.
Junior midfielder Leah Mohammadi and freshman forward Murphy Agnew lead the team’s attack. Mohammadi has posted nine points on four goals and an assist, while the rookie Agnew has chipped in seven points on two goals and three assists.
Four other Crimson players have scored a goal. A good mix of rookies and veterans—three freshmen and five upperclassmen—have posted at least one point.
“Our mindset now is, we have to attack,” Becker said. “Now we’ve really got to go all in.”
A more aggressive approach to the game could pay dividends against Harvard’s second Ivy opponent of the year, Yale, which it takes on in New Haven on Saturday.
“We know that we’re going to go into the game strong, and we know Yale’s a good opponent,” Chagares said. “We’re looking forward to the opportunity to play them.”
The Bulldogs are 0-3-1 in their last four contests after starting the season 6-0. Yale likewise lost its Ivy opener in shutout fashion, downed by Princeton, 2-0, and will be vying with the Crimson to get on the conference board.
The Tigers, for their part, look like a formidable squad, having risen to No. 7 in the RPI national Division I polls compiled on Sept. 24. The jump was sizable after Princeton was ranked 16th at the time it played Yale.
No. 7 Princeton is 8-1 and already 1-0 in conference play.
According to the RPI rankings, the second- and third-best teams in the Ivy League are Yale (85th) and Brown (87th), respectively, with the Crimson sitting at fourth (109th) in the polls.
Despite the trek ahead, there are positives that Harvard can look to.
“The more time passes, the closer the team has gotten, and I’m just amazed by the team chemistry this year,” Becker said. “Every time we practice, every time we see each other, it’s just getting better and better.”
Even if it doesn’t pull off a comeback, the Crimson veterans will be fighting hard next to a promising bunch of freshman forwards.
As for historical precedent, there was a stretch between 2007 and 2010 in which the Ivy League champion always had at least one game in the loss column.
So one can’t rule it out quite yet.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard football has matched up against Georgetown each of the last three seasons. In each contest, the Crimson took sizable halftime leads—all of them at least 17 points.
In 2014, it was a patented Harvard road win, 34-3, featuring 558 yards of total offense for the Crimson. The next season, an unfair 45-0 knockout. Last year, a closer, but not too close, 31-17 victory.
Recently, the Hoyas have not fared too well either in the nation’s capital or up north in Boston.
That being said, any Division I team can win on any given Saturday, and Georgetown will attempt to do just that this week at RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C.
“I certainly have respect that they’re a well-coached team,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “You can see that in all phases. I certainly respect that they have some really outstanding athletes, especially on the defensive side of the ball, especially on their defensive line and their secondary.”
So far, the Hoyas’ defense has shown the flashes of brilliance that Murphy mentions, at least in its first two games. Before conceding 35 points to Columbia, Georgetown allowed 10 and 14 points in their first two showings, respectively.
Defending against the run appears to be the Hoyas’ hallmark—in the first two weeks, opponents Campbell and Marist only mustered 118 combined rushing yards.
The Crimson’s ball carriers will face a tall task on Saturday. However, Murphy can turn to a multitude of versatile backs to combat differing defensive schemes. Junior Charlie Booker is the primary man out of the backfield, but junior Noah Reimers, sophomore Lavance Northington, and freshman Aaron Shampklin all provide consistent support.
Though Georgetown has proven itself much more on the defensive side of the ball, senior defensive back Tim Haehl cautions against underestimating the Hoyas’ offense.
“They always have a few up and down seasons, and we’ve done really well with them the past three years,” Haehl said. “But they’ve got a really talented wide receiver [Michael Dereus], and then their quarterback [Tim Barnes] has been pretty good the last two years.”
Dereus, a sophomore from Hyde Park, Mass., has racked up 312 yards in just three games this season. His 22.3 yards-per-catch and three touchdowns both lead the Hoyas. As for Barnes, the veteran struggled against Harvard in 2016, only completing six out of 16 pass attempts. He began as the starter this season, but last game he split time with junior Clay Norris.
Georgetown is not the only team with its quarterback spot up in the air, however. Harvard freshman Jake Smith started against Brown, only to be replaced by senior Joe Viviano in the second quarter, and only to return in the fourth.
Each signal caller saw positive results last week, and Murphy is keeping his options open for the near future.
“We’re happy with our quarterback situation,” Murphy said. “Right now it’s a very good competition between a freshman and a fifth-year senior, but we expect either guy could help us win football games.”
For Ivy League teams, it is tough to divide the season into individual parts. Since non-league games can occur as late as Week 5, teams have to alternate between non-conference contests and games against fellow Ancient Eight schools, the latter of which are infinitely more important because of their playoff implications.
“Going into the week I was thinking, ‘it’s an out-of-league game, it’s not as big of a deal,’” senior halfback Ryan Antonellis said. “But once we get to Sunday and we start getting prepped and our team gets in the mindset of playing for Ben, it’s easy to really get motivated and come out firing against Georgetown or whoever we’re playing.”
For some Crimson athletes, this game serves as not only a road trip to Washington but also as a homecoming. Antonellis, of Burke, Va., grew up a half hour from Georgetown and was recruited by the Hoyas.
“I definitely considered going there…,” Antonellis said. “I do know some players on the team, and I’m going to have some family and friends down at that game. It’s at RFK stadium, so kind of a cool venue to play at. It’s just going to be a little more of an emotional game for me than would be Lafayette or something like that.”
From 2011 to 2016, Harvard held a winning streak of 16 games versus opponents outside the Ivy League. Following a close loss to Holy Cross last season and a season-opening loss two weeks ago against Rhode Island, the Crimson’s non-conference dominance can finally be questioned.
This weekend, Harvard has a chance to begin anew with a victory over Georgetown.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

The Harvard men’s soccer team aims to open its 2017 Ivy League schedule with a win, as it travels to New Haven on Saturday to take on Yale. As history shows, the game could potentially be a high-scoring affair, as the last two matchups between the schools have produced a total of 10 goals between them.
The past, however, may not be comparable to today.
The Crimson (1-5-1) has had a slow start to its season, as it has only scored three times all season and is currently in the midst of a 3-game losing skid. Similarly, the beginning of the season hasn't been kind to Yale, as the Bulldogs sit at 3-4 and have struggled to score, having only scored six goals over seven games.
This all adds up to the fact that both teams will be looking for a much-needed win to start this season’s Ivy League schedule.
Harvard’s last run out was on Tuesday, when they faced off against Vermont at home.  Despite keeping a clean sheet for the first half, the Crimson couldn’t keep the Catamounts out forever, conceding two second half goals and eventually falling 2-0.
On Saturday, Harvard will be looking to increase its production up top. Despite its lackluster attacking record so far, the Crimson is looking to put its past behind it, and the team is making some changes on and off of the field in hopes of doing just that.
In addition, the team has been doing its homework ahead of the soccer edition of The Game.
“We’ve been reviewing what Yale does well and what they don’t do well,” senior midfielder Christian Sady said. “We’re definitely continuing to work on our attacking, we’ve struggled a little to score goals, but we’re not discouraged by that. I don’t think our last few results are indicative of where we’re at. We’re confident going into this game.”
Getting the first win against an Ivy League opponent isn’t the only thing on the line on Saturday, as both teams take lots of pride in their yearly matchup. The rivalry dates back to 1853, when the boat clubs of the two schools faced off in a race for the first time.
This was not only the first time the two schools competed against one another, but it was also the first time two American schools competed against one another in athletics altogether.  Thus, there is over a century and a half of history behind the feelings heading into this game.
In order to get the team into a practical mindset, however, senior defender and co-captain Eric Gylling is treating it as just another day at the office.
“We always try to approach it as if it were any other game,” Gylling said. “The guys always feel a little bit of tension, it’s the start of Ivy League play, and so the stakes sort of go up a little bit, but we approach it the same way we approach anything.”
The Crimson has had lots of success when facing Yale in the past few years, as the last time the Bulldogs defeated Harvard was in 2013, when the latter fell 2-1 in a close game in New Haven.
Saturday’s game will be the 104th meeting between the two storied institutions, with the Crimson having the edge in the series, 53-38-12.
Last year’s matchup ended in a thrilling 3-3 tie after double overtime, with the Crimson coming back from a 2-0 deficit by scoring 3 unanswered goals, only to concede a heartbreaking goal in the last 4 minutes of regulation. Neither side was able to break the deadlock in overtime, and thus the teams had to share the points on the day.
Two years ago, Harvard won 3-1, so spectators can expect a wide-open goal fest if the past two years are anything to go by.
The Crimson will need its top goal scorers, freshman midfielder/forward Paolo Belloni-Urso and sophomore forward Philip Hausen, along with Sady, freshman midfielder Cornelius Bencsik and others, to find the offensive rhythm that has thus far eluded them and start producing tallies on the scoreboard.
On the other side of the field, the defense, led by senior goalie Kyle Parks, and co-captains Gylling and Justin Crichlow, will be looking to shut down a Bulldog offense led by Kyle Kenagy and John Leisman, especially on set pieces. Their job might be made slightly easier by the fact that only four Yale players have recorded a goal this season.
After previous years’ success in the League, all eyes will be on the Crimson as it hopes to turn its season around.

We’ve all heard that we should aspire to take 10,000 steps per day in the name of our health. But let’s face it—when we encounter the all-too-familiar pile of psets, discussion papers, and textbook readings, our personal health crawls lower and lower down our list of priorities. Try this routine out for a day, and you’ll be fit in no time.

Have breakfast at Zinneken's: ~851 steps
What better way to celebrate your newfound health than a decadent plate of Belgian waffles smothered in syrup and dusted with powdered sugar? Never mind the calories, because the steps you took to get to the place totally cancel out the caloric intake.
Take your homework to Cabot: ~887 steps
Psetting doesn’t have to be a sedentary affair—head over to Cabot library in the Science Center to stretch your legs (and your brain) and watch the step count tick up.
Get Felipe’s for lunch: ~633 steps
That pset really got your appetite going, and you have been walking a lot today. You’ve probably entered a calorie deficit at this point. You deserve a nice, warm burrito. And maybe even a sopapilla.
Go back to Cabot: ~633 steps
A Pset calls.
Head to the Mac: ~747 steps
By now, you’re feeling like a true healthy person. Heck, you could probably even down an entire bottle of green juice. A workout at the Mac will be a nice break from your pset and a considerable contribution to your steadily improving health...
Hang a left on Bow St. and go to Insomnia Cookies instead: ~47 steps
...but you did take a lot of steps today, so do you really even need to work out? Insomnia is so close by, and you’ve been craving a snickerdoodle all day. Indulge, my friend, indulge. You’ll walk it all off by the end of the day.
Walk around the Yard: ~626 steps
While you get your steps in, count the number of tourists that touch the John Harvard statue and debate whether or not to warn them of the major health risks associated with the infamous practice.
Grab dinner at Pinocchio’s: ~561 steps
During your walk, you spotted some tourists in the yard with a Pinocchio’s Pizza box. Pinocchio’s is a godsend to Harvard Square, and you deserve a heaping slice (or two).
Late-night run (to J.P. Licks): ~462 steps
Lace up those tennis shoes and go for a light jog down Mass. Ave. to J.P. Licks. Logic says that since you ran there, you can have all the ice cream you want without worrying about compromising your health.
Total Step Count: ~5,447 steps
You know, getting 10,000 steps in a day isn’t all that important. The most significant factor of health is happiness. And what could make you happier (and thus, healthier) than a waffle cone at midnight?
