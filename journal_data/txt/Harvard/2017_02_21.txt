Boston’s Institute of Contemporary Art debuted a trio of new exhibitions this Valentine’s Day. Flanking the space devoted to the museum’s newest acquisitions are “Ashes” by Steve McQueen and the 2017 James and Audrey Foster Prize winners. These latter two exhibitions explore ideas of mourning, raw scenes, and the material substance of art.
While the eclecticism of a new acquisitions show—usually a mix of gifts and art specifically purchased by the accessions team—can pose curatorial difficulties for any museum, the ICA put up a solid effort in creating a survey indicative of the museum’s current direction and priorities. There was no lack of diversity, with artists of different genders, races, sexualities, and nationalities included in the gallery.
Just as prominent as issues of identity, the question of materiality seemed to inform much of the work on display. Sarah Sze’s 2001 multimedia work “Hidden Relief” was a clear standout. Built into the corner of the gallery, the various mechanical, found, and pseudo-organic forms—some of the Q-tips emerging from the corner almost resemble a sort of sea flora—created the sense of a great number of smaller sculptures built within its mass, in an effort that appears both meticulously executed and still under construction.
The short film “Ashes” by Steve McQueen—director of “12 Years a Slave,” which won the Academy Award for Best Motion Picture in 2014—in theory requires a multi-projector installation with two soundtracks, and the seamlessness of the final experience demonstrates the ICA staff’s superior attention to detail. Projected on both sides of a single screen, a viewer entering entering the exhibit from its left hand side sees footage of a young fisherman, Ashes, perched on the prow of a boat above crystal-blue waters. Entering from the right, on the other hand, reveals a video demonstrating the process of making the funerary monument for the same fisherman. Curators have taken care to exclude all ambient light and sound from the exhibition space. There is no wall or curtain alongside the screen to allow the soundtracks from both sides to intermingle, but in the sheer darkness of the room each side takes on an air of singular interiority. Blurring the line between life and death, “Ashes” evokes a haunting sense of personal loss.

Harvard faculty feature prominently among winners of the Foster Prize, awarded to Boston artists who have had greater exposure beyond the city than within it. Professor Lucien Castaing-Taylor and Véréna Paravel of Harvard’s Sensory Ethnography Lab, in addition to visiting VES lecturer Jennifer Bornstein, all contributed work. Here, the simplest yet most effective curatorial detail was the use of bean bag chairs in the installation of Castaing-Taylor and Paravel’s film “Leviathan” (2012). For a viewer watching a film shot with GoPro cameras on an industrial fishing vessel—where the shots crash in and out of the water, glide through fish guts, and soar in the air—the cradle of the bean bag chairs provides a literal immersion to match the aquatic weightlessness of the film. With Lucy Kim’s harrowing casts of the body, Bornstein’s encaustic rubbings made of her late father’s belongings, and Sonia Almeida’s biomorphic paintings, the Foster Prize exhibition presents a collection of contemporary art with a sense of ritual and sensation that feels almost archaic. As each of the three exhibits reveals in one way or another, contemporary art reflects a sense of history, personal or otherwise.

Boston Symphony Orchestra’s Andris Nelsons conducted Gunther Schuller’s “Seven Studies on Themes of Paul Klee,” Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s “Piano Concerto No. 22 in E-flat, K.482,” and Ludwig van Beethoven’s “Symphony No. 3 in E-flat, Opus 55, Eroica,” to enthusiastic applause and standing ovations on Feb. 17. In a packed Symphony Hall, musical virtuosity brought to life an enthralling blend of Modernism and Classical tradition.
The performance began with a rousing rendition of Schuller's “Seven Studies on Themes of Paul Klee,” a musical work of “thirdstream,” a genre of Schuller’s own invention falling halfway between classical and jazz. Based on Swiss modernist painter Paul Klee's Expressionist and Cubist paintings, Schuller’s synesthetic symphony contained seven distinct movements, each corresponding to a separate painting.
Nelsons led the orchestra through the twists and turns of the 23-minute piece, fraught with dissonant chords and tension. In “Antique Harmonies,” brass and woodwind evoked the repeated cadences of Klee’s patterned, blockish artistic style. “Abstract Trio,” during which only three instruments played at a time, mimicked the three, defined, abstract figures in Klee’s painting. And in the seventh and final movement, “Pastorale,” a striking oboe melody cut through layers of strings.
If “Seven Studies on Themes of Paul Klee” was a lesson in imitation, Mozart’s “Piano Concerto No. 22 in E-flat” was one in intricacy. Featured pianist Emanuel Ax deftly navigated the rapid call-and-response trills and fanfares of the allegro movement, as well as the andante’s mournful, melodic turns in C-minor. The symphony concluded with the third movement, an allegro in B-flat, a finale characterized by its formality and musical logic.
The performance culminated with Beethoven’s sweeping, magnificent Symphony No. 3, “Eroica.” Though he first dedicated his third symphony to French military leader Napoleon Bonaparte as a symbol of revolution, Beethoven later renamed the 51-minute symphony “Sinfonia eroica” after Bonaparte ambitiously declared himself to be emperor in a power grab that the composer deplored.
Nelsons swept through an energetic rendition of the “Allegro con brio,” a complex, introductory movement punctured by harmonically tense C-sharp chords. The symphony proceeded to “Marcia funebre: Adagio assai,” a methodical, solemn funeral march in C-minor. This seriousness and gravitas contrasted starkly with the following movement, a dynamic, spirited “Scherzo” interspersed with hunting calls by the horn section.
Nelsons concluded Beethoven’s “Eroica” with the grand “Finale: Allegro molto.” The twelve-minute tour de force demanded great rigor from the strings, whose bows bobbed rapidly through the quick tempo of Beethoven’s forceful “Finale.” Its joyful grandeur and dynamism dovetailed elegantly with its celebratory flourishes, a riveting conclusion met with a well-deserved standing ovation.

After Leo McGann received the Kennedy Center American College Theatre Festival’s National Partners of the American Theater Playwriting Award for “The Honey Trap,” director Adam Kassim had high expectations to live up to with the play’s debut production at the Boston Playwright’s Theatre. He did not disappoint. The emotional delivery of the leading actors, impressive staging, and engaging sound design combined to create a memorable performance.
An Irish tragedy, “The Honey Trap” revisits twisted events that transpired in 1979 when present-day Boston student Emily (Grace Georgiadis) interviews veteran Dave (Barlow Adamson) for an oral history project. He recalls the night that he and fellow British soldier Bobby spent at a pub in Belfast while off-duty. Dave unwittingly escaped death by returning to the barracks, but not before convincing his friend Bobby to go home with Irish girls Lisa (Maggie Markham) and Kirsty (Sarah Whelan), undercover IRA conspirators. Years later, when guilt-ridden Dave uses Emily’s project to locate one of the women, whose real name is Sonia, the past is suddenly not as distant as Dave believed.“The play explores this relationship of the past and present through memory, guilt, recrimination, and retribution,” writer McGann said.
Professionals Barlow Adamson and Maureen Keiller star as Dave and Sonia, respectively, and their extensive experience showed. The college students who portrayed the remaining characters lacked some of Adamson and Keiller’s ease of delivery and overall believability. Yet while the younger actors did not quite possess sufficient experience to reach the standard set by their seniors, their performance was nothing to dismiss. The natural camaraderie between young Dave (Conrad Sundqvist-Olmos) and Bobby (Ben Swimmer) was especially impressive, as were the thick Geordie accents they maintained for most of the play.
Though the opening cacophony of garbled voices and clashing music that filled the theater grated on the ears, its appropriateness soon became apparent amidst the ensuing pain and confusion of the narrative. Overall, sound design by J. Jumbelic proved integral to the performance. As Dave and Emily dredged up more details from the past, auditory cues helped draw connections to the present that the audience might otherwise have missed. For example, when Sonia repeats a phrase that she spoke as “Lisa” years ago, Jumbelic superimposes her echoing younger voice over it, creating a chilling effect that replicates what Dave is undoubtedly feeling.
“The Honey Trap” did not allow the inherent limitations of a stage or live performance to hinder its delivery but rather ingeniously used such features to its advantage. Scenic designer Jeffrey Petersen’s tri-level set successfully enabled the portrayal of various times and locations in an intimate black box theater. At times, scenes from the past and present simultaneously unfolded, giving the illusion of a triggered memory playing out in characters’ heads. Petersen’s attention to detail was also impressive: He includes graffitied walls and a shattered window to prevent audience members from forgetting the violence of the Troubles, even in present scenes. The broken glass also corresponded to the image seen on the play’s program, an ominous reminder of its dark subject.
Kassim took advantage of the set design to give the late Bobby a haunting omnipresence throughout Dave’s adult life, especially as thoughts of forgiveness and revenge warred within him. While Dave stood on the main stage, Bobby loomed above him on the set’s upper tiers or lurked on the outskirts of the stage floor. In addition, the characters’ younger selves sometimes played out Dave’s past experiences as he described them to Emily. Initially, the visual representation of his statements convinced theatergoers of their accuracy, but as he suddenly reveals at the end of Act I, Dave may not be as innocent as he seems.
Due to Dave and Sonia’s unreliable accounts of what exactly happened on that night in 1979, the audience was left guessing about the actual circumstances surrounding Bobby’s murder until the dramatic final scene revealed the shocking truth. This mix between history lesson and murder mystery incorporated a fascinating plot, skilled actors, and smart production decisions to make “The Honey Trap” a truly thrilling theatrical experience.
“The Honey Trap” is at the Boston Playwright’s Theater Feb. 16-26.

The central premise of famed Chinese director Zhang Yimou’s “The Great Wall” is that the titular structure was built to protect China from hordes of rapacious flesh-eating lizard-horse-cows called taotie (spelled “tao tei” in the subtitles possibly as a result of incorrect Romanization). According to the film, these beasts exist as a reminder of the dangers of human greed, and the great irony is that the movie is itself an example of the disaster that arises when the desire to sell movie tickets to white audiences overshadows artistic integrity and social responsibility.
When poster and trailer for “The Great Wall” were released last fall, numerous Asian-American actors and activists condemned the casting of Matt Damon, a white man, as the lead in a film set in ancient China. “We have to stop perpetuating the racist myth that [only a] white man can save the world,” tweeted Constance Wu leading actress in “Fresh Off the Boat.” Damon defended his casting, asking audiences to watch the film before judging it. “I think you are undermining your own credibility when you attack something without seeing it,” he stated at the New York Comic-Con shortly after the backlash began. Now that the film has been released, however, it seems fair to say that the criticism was more than justified.
In the interest of diplomacy, it should be acknowledged that “The Great Wall” is not a film entirely without merit. Its $150 million budget—the largest of any film shot entirely in China—was used successfully to create a visual spectacle. The cinematographic beauty of certain scenes is striking; that is, until mediocre CGI and an inundation of excessively painterly backdrops leave the film looking something like a cross between a video game and a Windows desktop background. But The film’s visual excess is the least of its problems.
The plot is so predictable that spoiler alerts seem superfluous: Special White Man William (Damon) and his friend Tobar (Pedro Pascal) are European mercenaries captured by an elite Chinese army. When monsters attack, Special White Man William dazzles the Chinese with his archery skills and slow-motion fight sequences. Special White Man William saves the life of a hairless whimpering boy-child of a soldier (Luhan). Special White Man William impresses a female commander, who teaches him about trust and honor. It is not difficult to guess who saves China from the taotie in the end.
It’s true that the film has a Chinese director and an almost entirely Chinese cast, and that it was released in China months before it premiered in the United States. However, Damon’s very Caucasian William is indisputably the hero of the story, while most of the Chinese cast is dehumanized as an anonymous though well-choreographed mass (appropriately called “The Nameless Order”) whose sole purpose is to exist as a stage set for the White Man’s moral and emotional journey. The only Chinese character to receive substantial individual screen time is Commander Lin Mae (Tian Jing), a pretty-faced trope virtually indistinguishable from the heroines of countless other martial arts films (think Tigress from “Kung Fu Panda.”) “The Great Wall” does not depict cultural reciprocity or cross-cultural understanding because its only real character is the Special White Man.
Perhaps the fact that this film was a largely Chinese production makes its clichéd tone-deafness all the more disturbing. It is disappointing that even a Chinese director takes for granted that the White Man has the face that audiences are meant to root for and sympathize with. White Man William shoots his arrow, and the yellow men stand and clap for him; in his presence, the yellow warrior women are reduced to simpering anime girls, for they are unused to the White Man’s rugged white masculinity. This film teaches lessons so insidiously ubiquitous in the media we consume that it is easy to become inured to them: The White Man must always be the main character, and all others serve merely to further his story. The White Man is a Real Man; yellow boys are scared, small, faceless. The fact that “The Great Wall” is a Chinese film does not render it innocent of perpetuating racist stereotypes. On the contrary, the film’s Eurocentric narrative suggests that the influence of colonialism is still very much present in modern China.
Filmmakers have the right, of course, to create what they see fit without taking notions of “political correctness” into account. Creating deeply harmful, socially irresponsible art is their prerogative. But even so, is a lazy smattering of colonialist tropes really art? How about 103 minutes of pandering to a white audience? Ultimately, “The Great Wall” shows the audience little more than profit-driven greed strong enough to summon taotie from the depths of the earth.

Big Sean’s 14-song album, “I Decided,” was released on Apple Music, Spotify, and most other music platforms on Feb. 5. The album features several collaborative acts including Jeremih, Eminem, TWENTY88, The Dream, Migos, and Starrah. While Big Sean garners plenty of A-list artists, he notably enlists Michigan’s Flint Chozen Choir for his track “Bigger Than Me.” Throughout most of his album, Big Sean treats his listeners to a survey of his inner troubles and the lessons he has learned by overcoming them.
While Big Sean’s success on the airwaves remains undoubted with tracks such as “Blessings” and “I Don’t Fuck With You,” Big Sean turns confidently toward reflection in “I Decided,” largely on his rise in the music industry. Big Sean’s career needs “No Favors,” and he knows it—it’s the title of the album’s fourth track. As the album’s name suggests, Big Sean has decided that he has become a success and can now only look down from the heights of his career. His boastful persona complements his grateful lyrics: He thanks everyone from his mother to God.
The album begins with a one-minute intro track that sets the retrospective tone and perfectly blends into “Lights,” a track that only uses a light melody and Jeremih’s voice as the beat for Big Sean’s. Because of that simplicity, Big Sean speaks directly to his audience and leads them through his career’s winding path, serving as the light that illuminates the way. On this winding path, Big Sean admits that he has taken some wrong turns. In “Halfway Off the Balcony,” he realizes that a good life is about relationships and not about the superficial. “Bounce Back” adresses Big Sean’s ability to recover from taking a wrong turn by getting back onto the correct path. He acknowledges that his rise to success has been difficult, but he perseveres through it all. In “Sacrifices,” Big Sean explains how every turn he made through the music industry forced him to leave behind free time, friendships, and even romantic relationships, all for the sake of becoming the success he is now. Together, these tracks poignantly mark the milestones that Big Sean has reached in his music career.
Clearly maturing as both an artist and as a person, Big Sean acknowledges that his influence can make a real impact on world issues such as Flint’s water crisis. On his last track, “Bigger Than Me”, Big Sean features the Flint Chozen Choir to aid his home state creatively. Feeling a sense of duty, Big Sean’s foundation also made a contribution of $100,000 for the crisis. On a Jan. 24 appearance on “The Daily Show With Trevor Noah,” Big Sean explained: "It's not even close to being over. That situation wasn't a natural disaster. It's something that should've been prevented and could've been prevented, so it's just disgusting to think about the damages that these families and even kids have to go through with the lead poisoning." As for the track itself, the resonantly collective voice of the choir gives it an ethereal sound that satisfyingly concludes the album and its concept.
While the concept of “I Decided” is honorable, Big Sean moves off message on “Moves” (“You gotta move / She make that back move / She made her titties move / I make the city move”), detracting from the full impact of the album. Additionally, the lack of variability in Big Sean’s cadence and the spliced sounds that are used as a beat make the track feel mediocre at best, and boring at worst. As a whole, however, the album proclaims that Big Sean is not afraid to explore his retrospective persona, despite the pressure for successful rappers to appear insensitive and hard. Big Sean moves in the right direction with this album by separating himself from the herd.

Two women sit peacefully on a rock along the edge of an ocean. Turn your head to the left, then to the right, and become immersed in the vastness of the ocean alongside them, which seems to stretch into infinity. Rotating completely for a full 360-degree perspective, the sound of the two women talking becomes quieter, while the sound of waves crashing against the rock grows in volume. It’s like you’re immersed entirely in this world, completely engaged by and fully present in the scene—except the rock beneath your feet is actually just the concrete floor of the Carpenter Center, transformed by Daniel A. Citron ’16 for his senior thesis.
Virtual reality is a burgeoning medium combining art and technology to create an experience unprecedented in the immersion it offers. The relatively recent technology, which is beginning to take hold at Harvard, allows users to enter a 360-degree computer-generated or video-created environment, typically by wearing a headset. While science fiction writers have speculated about the possibilities of such totalizing illusions since the early 20th century, practical virtual reality has developed quickly over the past couple years. With the 2014 purchase of virtual reality company Oculus by Facebook, as well as efforts within large tech companies such as Google, HTC, and Samsung, virtual reality began to enter the public eye.
“You’re building an entire world where people want to spend time and have experiences,” explains Citron.
Ruth S. Lingford, Citron’s thesis adviser and the director of undergraduate studies for the Visual and Environmental Studies department, describes virtual reality as an all-encompassing illusion. “Virtual reality is kind of the same feeling of almost letting go of yourself and just being immersed in someone else’s dream,” Lingford says.
In that sense, virtual reality might be seen as a logical progression in the development of art and technology. With photography, then film, and now the projection of images in a 360-degree space, art has gained the potential to mimic life ever more closely—and some students at Harvard are exploring this possibility.
“With every new technology medium, there is always this fear it’s going to destroy the last one,” says Citron, who was the first student in the VES department to work extensively in virtual reality. He explains that people are often skeptical about new art and technology media. For example, many in the early years of film thought that movies might destroy theater. “But I think history has shown us that hasn’t happened. Each of these storytelling mediums tends to succeed in ways that the other mediums don’t. The advantages you get of telling a story in a fully immersive 3D environment are very different than advantages you get in film.”
From Citron’s senior thesis project to the virtual reality studio officially opening at the Harvard Innovation Labs this Thursday, there is a growing, if decentralized, interest in this technology at Harvard.
While the new technology creates opportunities for students and professors at Harvard, it also comes with many challenges, particularly given that no clear leaders of virtual reality development have emerged in the hardware and software industries.
Moreover, the unique advantages that Citron points out—the ability to create a space that tells different stories than those that can be told through film—are challenges just the same. Connor Doyle ’19, an avid virtual reality proponent and creator who founded the student group Convrgency: Harvard College Virtual Reality, says that an inherent issue with virtual reality is determining when and why to use it.
“The fundamental question that not enough people are asking right now [is], ‘Why am I doing this in VR? Why should I be doing this in 360?’ A lot of people think by placing a camera in the middle of the room and blocking action around the camera, that is a VR experience,” says Doyle. Doyle compared the 360-degree camera used in virtual reality to a person. To create a compelling virtual reality or 360-degree experience, the camera probably shouldn’t just be standing in the middle of a room, he says. Instead, for Doyle, the movement and action directed around that “person” or camera in the space is what can make virtual reality particularly compelling.
Another issue that creators of virtual reality must consider is the limits of humans’ visual field. Even with the assistance of peripheral vision, humans have only a 180-degree visual field. A viewer cannot digest the entire space at once. Citron and Doyle agree there isn’t one answer to this issue. Citron, who now works as a virtual reality designer for Google, often uses sound to direct a user’s focus.
On a more logistical level, however, the industry of virtual reality faces another significant challenge: limited accessibility, both on the consumption and creation sides. These challenges are ones several students interested in virtual reality at Harvard have seen.
In terms of hardware necessary for virtual reality consumption, headsets have often proven to be expensive as well as clunky. The virtual reality industry has grown more accessible to consumers through cheaper options such as Google Cardboard, but with the cheaper devices comes reduced functionality.
In terms of hardware for production of 360-degree videography, there are several cheaper options available now such as Ricoh Theta, which allow for entry-level virtual reality producers to get a head start. But it’s a science that hasn’t yet been perfected: A 360-degree camera works by stitching together different frames, sometimes causing distortion. And the quality of many 360-degree cameras, particularly the amateur-grade ones, is limited. Even high-quality video can become fairly pixelated in virtual reality.
Carol Dysinger, a professor at New York University—one of the few universities that have classes teaching production-side virtual reality—has noticed this barrier with video quality. “A student [in one of my classes] made some work that got into a fairly big festival, but they couldn’t show it because the video wasn’t high enough resolution,” she explains.
These limitations have proven to be a barrier at Harvard in particular, affecting the work of student groups like Convrgency. Doyle uses his own headset for virtual reality demos, and he purposefully crafted the student group to be one primarily based on critical discussion rather than pure creation, largely due to hardware shortages. “At Convrgency, we don’t even have a room,” Doyle explains—let alone several thousand dollars for headsets.
To provide resources that allow for innovation by removing some of these initial barriers, the Harvard Innovation Labs (i-lab) recently opened a virtual reality studio space, which will have its official opening this Thursday.
“If we can help make those connections and bring people together, that’s what we want to do,” says Jodi Goldstein, Managing Director of the i-lab. “Building upon that we decided that so much of what we do is providing resources and access to innovators. If you’re looking to innovate in [virtual reality] you actually need the equipment to do that. Why not build out a lab?”
While virtual reality as a concept may seem exciting to many people, these limitations lead some at Harvard to wonder if perhaps virtual reality more a technological novelty than an art form.
“Everyone I demo to is super excited about it and wants to think about it,” Doyle says. “Usually, I’m going to be honest with you—usually, people after that never email me again.”
Doyle speculates that this lack of sustained interest could in part be due to a lack of quality content in virtual reality. He says that there is only so much you can show a person in virtual reality at present and that seeking out further “good” virtual reality can be a difficult task. “And I think part of it, again, is [the] limitation of resources,” Doyle explains.
Others say that the novelty appeal of virtual reality may in fact be the cause of this lack of quality content. “The thing I’ve worried about ... is the feeling of being in love with the technology and just being obsessed with what the thing can do,” says Lingford. Lingford refers to it as the “siren call” of the technology’s potential, which can often distract from more artistic work. She says that Citron was an example of someone doing the exact opposite: exploring potential in the new medium while staying focused on what he wanted from the technology, rather than what the technology wanted from him.
Lingford admitted that some colleagues had been skeptical about her approval of a virtual reality thesis. But by the time Citron’s thesis was complete, those with doubts had completely changed their minds, she says.
“It is kind of magical and wonderful what this medium can do, and it’s important to keep critical of the work,” she adds. “So that’s maybe a problem for the medium. It could get aesthetically weak by a lack of critique.”
Despite the challenges in the industry, students and faculty across Harvard continue to explore virtual reality.
Goldstein, the i-lab Managing Director, lists off name after name of students and affiliates at Harvard who are working on  virtual reality projects. She says that many of the students and affiliates don’t know anyone else working in virtual reality at Harvard. This isolation may be due in part to virtual reality’s close relation to several disciplines, from filmmaking to computer science. “Industries that are seemingly unrelated are coming together,” Goldstein says.
To help remedy this disconnect, the i-lab stepped in to create the AR/VR Studio—a space that provides resources and guidance in virtual reality and augmented reality. After a one-day AR/VR-focused event hosted by the i-lab last fall that attracted 1,200 registrants, Goldstein and her team came to the realization that there needed to be a central space for virtual reality innovation. “There is a lot of demand and a lot going on but it’s all happening separately,” she says. The i-lab aspires to create a space that brings those interested in virtual reality together and provide them equipment. The i-lab also officially sponsors the Harvard AR/VR Student Alliance, a student organization that includes both graduates and undergraduates.
Seven College students are on the board of Convrgence. Twelve are on the board of Dreamporte, an organization working to bring virtual reality into local classrooms. Still others have created their own virtual reality startups.
Though no academic classes related to virtual reality exist, students have persisted in finding ways to explore the emerging medium.
“There is definitely an appetite [for virtual reality] on campus,” says Doyle.
Virtual reality at Harvard isn’t being explored just for storytelling. While much of the mainstream, like Citron’s, revolves around the world of entertainment—art, video, animation, and gaming—applications extend beyond this purpose. Some student startups have worked to push the boundaries of virtual reality.
Alex Wendland ’19, who is currently taking time off from Harvard, founded Luminopia during his freshman year along with two other students. Luminopia is a company aiming to use virtual reality to treat amblyopia, or lazy eye. The current common treatment for lazy eye is to use eye patches.
“Healthcare normally feels medical. It feels sterile, not comfortable and approachable,” says Wendland, whose startup was a part of the venture incubation program at the i-lab. “With virtual reality, you’re able to leverage consumer design trends and art oriented features in order to make it much more comfortable.”
Wendland says he believes that virtual reality will be most applicable in the medical field and offer a variety of potential purposes—many of which are currently being developed—such as stroke rehabilitation or practicing surgeries.
Matthew R. McGill ’17 is currently working to bring virtual reality to classroom education, mainly in middle school, both as after-school programs as well as during the school day. He is a co-founder of Dreamporte, a startup that also was a part of the venture incubation program at the i-lab. Dreamporte’s mission is twofold: first, they are helping schools find physical resources to bring virtual reality hardware to the classroom, and second, they provide teachers with virtual reality lesson recommendations.
McGill said the biggest pushback from schools is the lack of concrete evidence about whether virtual reality technology actually raises test scores—and therefore whether the new technology merits budgeting and fundraising. McGill has seen firsthand, though, the impact of virtual reality on student learning.
“There’s definitely an upward trend that I see [in students]. In that first part [of the classroom lesson] where I’m trying to give them a little bit of a lesson and teach them, they seem more eager to answer my questions and gain something from what they see, once they start to realize how fun and how interesting the videos can be,” McGill says, who has taught virtual reality in the classroom as a part of Dreamporte. “As the semester goes on, they’re getting so much more enthusiastic and we have great discussions after we watch the video.”
Lingford said that the VES department would “absolutely, absolutely” consider adding courses related to the virtual reality medium.
Because it is such a new medium, only a few schools across the nation have introduced academic courses about the creation of content in virtual reality. New York University is one of the schools that currently offer classes. Professors Sarah Rothberg and Carol Dysinger, both of whom teach a graduate course called “Directing Virtual Reality,” say that the main challenges keeping virtual reality from being taught in the classroom are a lack of experienced professors and the cost of hardware.
Rothberg and Dysinger also note that NYU didn’t simply come knocking on their door asking for someone to teach a virtual reality class. They proposed and developed it themselves, though administrators encouraged cross-school collaboration in classes, Dysinger says.
At Harvard, Lingford is excited. She has started looking into Tilt Brush, an app to create animations in a 360-degree space. Yet she says that the department will have to wait and see where the technology goes before making an investment in virtual reality and 360-degree technology.
“You can do the thinking through any medium. There’s nothing that special about pencils, and you can certainly do a senior thesis at Harvard using pencils,” Lingford says. “It’s about thinking. And certainly [virtual reality] can be used for that.”
Students like Citron and Doyle express their hope that despite the current challenges, students at Harvard can continue to explore virtual reality, whether inside or outside the classroom. Goldstein says that she hopes that the AR/VR Studio at the i-lab will mitigate some of these challenges.
“For a platform that is predicated upon cross-discipline innovation, Harvard should really be a leader,” Goldstein says. “My hope is more and more collaborations occur, and more and more innovations occur, that maybe we haven’t even imagined yet. We can talk about things that already exist, but what about what we haven’t even thought about yet? It’s the unknown that’s most exciting. We don’t even know what we don’t know.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Let’s do the Time Warp again!” sang Dr. Frank N. Furter’s celebratory servants as a lost couple entered their castle. “The Rocky Horror Picture Show” premiered at Adams Pool Theater on Feb. 17, taking the audience back to 1975, the year that saw the release of the unparalleled cult classic. The show is a science fiction Frankenstein musical to which audiences can laugh and sing along.
Directors Julia E. Belanoff ’18 and Patric C. Verrone ’18, who also played the leading role of cross-dressing castle owner Dr. Frank N. Furter, created an adaptation that hews closely to the original: Throughout the whole show, the actual movie runs in the background, with the onstage actors lip-synching and imitating their onscreen counterparts.
Of course, it would not be “Rocky Horror” if it did not engage the audience. Both staff and cast made sure that this was the case: Upon entering the theater, every guest received a party horn to celebrate the birth of Rocky, a newspaper to shield their head from the rain that poured down on Janet, and a rubber glove to snap just like Dr. Frank N. Furter did in the show. Before the play began, the storyteller (Julius Wade ’20) entered the stage and gave a humorous warm-up that set the peculiar mood for what was to come. Furthermore, the storyteller encouraged the audience to heckle (Brad routinely elicited “asshole” calls while Janet was called a “slut”), sing along, and dance as they wished. Conveniently, everyone received dancing lessons before the beginning of the musical—after all, it was just a jump to the left and a step to the ri-i-iiight.
The most memorable elements of “The Rocky Horror Picture Show” were undoubtedly its songs. There was a lot of earworm potential there: “Over at the Frankenstein Place,” “The Time Warp,” “Damn it, Janet,” just to name a few. These catchy and well-known tunes alone made attending the show worth it. For the most part, the actors and actresses delivered skillful and very humorous musical performances. Unfortunately, however, the background film audio remained unmuted during dialogue scenes, causing a slightly irritating reverberation. For those who have watched the movie, Verrone’s embodiment of Dr. Frank N. Furter may have seemed a bit underwhelming compared to Tim Curry’s unique take on the role, but overall Verrone executed the demanding role well.
The minimalistic set design worked beautifully—a door, a wall, and a couch were all that was needed to bring Dr. Frank N. Furter’s castle to life. The actors made efficient use of the pool’s limited space, entering the theater through multiple entrances. The costumes were also immaculate: sometimes flashy, always true to the 70s. Coats, skirts, and suits paired with high heels, stockings, and corsets, resembling the scantily clad actors in the film.
“The Rocky Horror Picture Show” at Adams Pool Theater is just the right show to understand past generations’ obsession with a seemingly senseless flick. It carries on the legacy of the musical-turned-film (turned musical).The audience could sense the passion that both cast and staff have put into bringing this musical on stage as well as their willingness to share this feeling with the spectator (admission was free). The strengths of the show undoubtedly overrode its small imperfections. All in all, “The Rocky Horror Picture Show” took its audience on a bizarre yet amusing trip that is best enjoyed like the original movie: slightly inebriated with a couple of good friends.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“He is a man buried alive; to be dug out in the slow round of years; and in the meantime dead to everything but torturing anxieties and horrible despair.”
—Charles Dickens,“American Notes”, 1842
This past Sunday—Feb. 19, 2017—marked the one-year anniversary of Albert Woodfox’s release from prison; he was the last member of the Angola 3 to be released from Louisiana’s infamous Angola prison. Woodfox, who will be speaking at Harvard next month, “walked through the gates of hell into freedom.”
He has been free for 366 days. He spent the prior 15,695 days in solitary confinement. Those forty-three years marked the longest that any man had ever spent in such conditions.
Woodfox and other Angola 3 members Robert King and Herman Wallace were held in solitary confinement for a combined total of more than a hundred years. The reason for their unfathomably long stay in solitary can be traced to a very simple explanation: They were political prisoners, held in solitary for decades to discourage others from organizing with the Black Panthers. In 1972, a year after the three started the first recognized chapter of the Black Panther Party on prison grounds, a prison guard was killed; prison officials had no suspects. So, the three political agitators became the obvious fall-men, convicted in a mockery of a trial.
Woodfox, King, and Wallace were not deterred, however. They refused to give up teaching, organizing, and learning with their fellow prisoners, even after decades of solitary. Woodfox knew that his values and principles would keep him alive and sane: “I know how many times they offered that if I gave up my party they’d let me out of solitary. Each time I told them, get out of my face.”
The six-by-nine foot solitary box is smaller than the typical horse stable. Inmates in solitary spend 23 hours per day in these cells. Between 80 and 120 thousand Americans on any given day are, as Shaka Senghor described, “squeezed into a coffin,” treated as “dead to everyone in the general prison population.”
The public has no control over solitary confinement’s frequent and discriminatory application. Solitary confinement is not a sentence handed down by a judge or jury; it is a classification that prisons are allowed to unilaterally impose on inmates, for “walking too slowly” or too fast – it can be imposed on inmates “for talking too much”. Just ask Woodfox and his fellow Angola Black Panthers.
To this day, black and Hispanic prisoners are held in solitary at immensely disproportionate rates. Black and Hispanic prisoners constitute 60 percent of all arrests, but 95 percent of those held in solitary confinement.
Three hundred and fifty thousand of those held in our jails and prisons have serious mental illnesses, more than ten times the number held in our country’s mental institutions. Of those in the general prison population, it is estimated that one-third to one-half of prisoners in solitary confinement suffer from mental illness. The implications of this are stunning: We have, for all intents and purposes, eschewed real mental health treatment altogether. Instead, we are inflicting upon vast swaths of our mentally ill population a punishment that is universally regarded by health professionals as detrimental to mental health. It is the healthcare principle of "out of sight, out of mind."
In “Hell is a Very Small Place: Voices from Solitary Confinement”, Judith Vazquez described the feeling of solitary as tantamount to being buried alive; she resorted to scraping at the rubber seal on her window frame for any small amount of fresh air: “I needed some air … I believe it took about six months of scraping and bleeding before I finally made a tiny little hole.” The hole was big enough for just one nostril.
“It gave me a sense of being human again,” Vasquez writes.
In his own words, Woodfox, like Judith and countless others, has known “more pain and suffering than any human being should be asked to suffer.” Solitary confinement is a punishment that completely outstrips our ability to comprehend it. Virtually anyone would struggle with a few hours of solitary. Woodfox gave 360,985 hours of his life to it.
Just last week, the New Yorker reported on the devastating loss of Lonnie Hamilton. Like Kalief Browder and countless others before him, Lonnie found the effects of solitary confinement too much to bear. He took his own life.
The work of ending this barbaric torture has never been more urgent. It is a punishment, as Alexis de Tocqueville and Gustave Beaumont described in their 1833 treatise on US penitentiaries,“beyond the strength of man; it destroys the criminal without intermission and without pity; it does not reform, it kills.”
Albert Woodfox and Robert King are coming to Harvard on March 8th. They have dedicated their post-incarceration lives to fighting for “the abolishment of solitary confinement and freedom for political prisoners.” “I choose to use my anger  as a means for changing things,” Woodfox said after his release.
“Everybody has fear,” Woodfox continued. “Fear is the soul telling the body that it’s in danger. Some people overcome that fear. I overcame it by having a cause.”
We hope you will join us.

Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith’s statement that graduate student admissions will be cut by 4.4 percent this year is concerning. These reductions, attributed primarily to $2 billion worth of losses in endowment value, evidences the urgency of financial security to the University’s functioning and goals. As a hint of the necessary gravity behind this move, smaller graduate admissions classes could have an impact further down the road on the undergraduate experience. The implications include the possibility of a smaller available pool of teaching fellows for courses, inciting worries among graduate students wary of potentially larger workloads and responsibilities to account for their reduced numbers. In general, the reduced range of perspective that will result from fewer such students is lamentable.
This situation serves as a reminder that Harvard’s educational mission cannot operate separately from its basic financial needs. Indeed, the latter is essential to pursuing the former. We are optimistic that the recent changes at Harvard Management Company, which include bringing its investment practices more in line with those of peer institutions, will help restore financial security and budgetary normalcy. The student body would do well to take note: Despite having the largest endowment of any university, Harvard’s money is not endless, and limits require trade-offs.
We are hopeful that Harvard’s endowment will not underperform indefinitely, and for the time being, we commend FAS for adapting to the current situation appropriately. Stubbornly attempting to maintain graduate admissions numbers could exacerbate problems down the road. Despite the unfortunate need to cut some deserving applicants, Smith’s remark about ensuring as “outstanding a student experience as possible” for current students demonstrates the administration’s commitment to honoring prior promises.
Indeed, despite its financial struggles, the University has sought to continue business as usual. Harvard’s recently announced pledge to adhere to the scheduled timeline of the Lowell House renewal through additional debt is another example of the University’s commitment to its students. Similarly, Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris told The Crimson that section sizes would not grow as a result of the budget cuts.
The University’s response to these financial problems displays a careful consideration for the balance between current and future students. While this situation is certainly a regrettable one, we must recognize that Harvard’s wealth of resources does not obviate the need for making difficult decisions. We are glad that the administration has chosen a responsible path, and hope that they continue to be flexible until Harvard’s budgetary situation improves.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Quick pro tip: Do not question the presence of hand grenades and fishbowls in the absence of both war and fish on Bourbon St. Well, the absence of war might be an overstatement, and surely the Mississippi is being exhumed of crawfish at an alarming rate (and somebody should do something about that)—but the New Orleans experience is incomplete without a night well spent in the presence of jazz, oddly-named drinks, and a conversation with the locals. They, at first glance, may simply blend in with the New Orleans backdrop, but give them a chance to peel the night off their backs and they may prove themselves a different person.
The last part is a hidden treasure that the flashy brochures keep hidden beneath the centerfold. The French Market, Café du Monde—all of these sights screamed tourist. Walk into the streets and take a picture of impromptu street performers, try the King Cake, hope to find a baby Jesus. Leave the city with photos and a full stomach but you’re still the same; tasted the city but haven’t found the baby Jesus just yet.
The baby Jesus, oddly enough, came while I was spreading Thinset and laying tile a little ways outside of the city. Over J-term, I volunteered with a group of other students through Harvard’s Habitat for Humanity chapter and worked on two houses. From tiling and grouting to painting and caulking, some of us were painfully out of our element. But what we lacked in construction expertise we compensated for in dedication to learning the task and laughter (one more than the other).  Before we knew it, the five days on the worksite had passed, and our goodbyes loomed large on the cement-trimmed horizon.
Yet as one of the last days came to a close, the construction supervisor wandered over to chat with a group of us. He sat on the bathtub as we fitted a tile around the base of the toilet. “You know, I didn’t know what to make of y’all when you first came here, being from Harvard and all. I thought you would be pretentious—but then I just realized that y’all were just people.”
I laughed, and was going to agree with him, but stopped myself because the stereotype that Harvard students are pretentious isn’t completely outlandish. This much is true; we are people. We watch Netflix and go out on Friday nights and freak out before tests and make mistakes and regret bad choices and almost cut off our fingers with circle saws (which totally isn’t a personal anecdote). We are fallible—this is undeniably true. Yet, to say just this, to dismiss his initial premise regarding how we present ourselves to the world would be unfair to not only him but to ourselves as well.
Coming to school here, I had the exact same reservations as he did. Suddenly I was catapulted from diverse, run-of-the-mill New Jersey public schools to the most prestigious school I could imagine. People back home associate me with this name brand, but I hadn’t reconciled myself with this image. This prestige was a flashy brochure; I saw the sights through someone else’s camera lens and was scared to call them mine. The castle-like ambiance of Annenberg, the infamous John Harvard statue—all of these sights screamed tourist. Walk through the Yard and see people from all over the world in awe at the school you take for granted; try the Veritaffle. Leave the Yard with photos and a full stomach, but this time I was worried that I would change, that I would become this stereotypical nose-upturned snob that we Harvard students appear to be from the outside.
During my time here, I have found these people. Those who look down on others due to socioeconomic status, high school aristocracy, perceived academic adeptness, breadth of extracurriculars or more—they do exist. They are just as valid a representation of Harvard is as the 12 self-selected students and I that volunteered to build houses over winter break. We are two sides of the same brochure; it is the reader’s choice, however, to look beneath the centerfold.
So instead of simply laughing away his initial expectations, I agreed with them. I told him his impressions were unfortunately true in some respects. Yet, I also thanked him for seeing our dimensionality, and for giving us a chance to break ourselves out of the elitist box the Harvard name places you in, the box that family, friends, and strangers have expected you to find a home in.
We said our goodbyes, left the town that night, and went back to New Orleans. The city was alive with lights, fluorescent neon trimming Bourbon St. for blocks as people weaved in and out of a thousand bars, heading in a million different directions. I wondered how much of my first impression of these strangers represented truly who they were, sans hand grenades and fishbowls and the unflattering light of a Saturday night out on the town. But I didn’t dwell on this thought too long. I simply took a few photos and walked away, stomach a bit emptier than I expected.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 21, 2017 at 4:00 p.m. 
More than 1.4 million emails—some divulging Harvard students’ grades, financial aid information, and at least one individual's Social Security number—sent over Harvard Computer Society email lists were open to the public until Monday.
Teaching fellows, resident tutors, College administrators, and thousands of undergraduates have used the email list service—which the student group made private Monday—for years. Emails sent over HCS lists contained the membership of certain BGLTQ undergraduate groups, bank account numbers for some student organizations, advance copies of a final exam, and answer keys to problem sets.
At times, teaching fellows used the lists to discuss students’ grades—a move some legal experts say may violate the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, a federal law designed to protect students’ privacy.
While only Harvard affiliates could access the directory of the email lists, the emails themselves were open to the public.
Over two dozen students who manage HCS lists said they never realized their emails were public. All College administrators who used the lists—including Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana—were also unaware their messages were public, according to Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane.
HCS made the lists private after The Crimson contacted the organization last week. Jason T. Goodman ’18, the co-president of HCS, said he knew some email lists were public but was unaware of the scope of the issue.
“We occasionally received requests to make lists private from alumni that had inadvertently created public—made information public, but I would say infrequently,” Goodman said. “We didn’t think it was likely to be a common issue.”
Anyone with a Harvard email address could set up an email list through HCS. The default setting for HCS list archives was public, meaning users’ emails remained publicly available unless list owners specified otherwise.
“We assumed that, in the majority of cases, people had configured their lists correctly,” Goodman said.
Of the roughly 7,000 email lists logged in HCS’s online index, the vast majority—more than 5,500—had publicly accessible archives, according to a Crimson analysis of the lists. In an effort to protect students’ privacy, The Crimson delayed publication of this story until HCS gave all list administrators the opportunity to make their archived emails private.
James H. Waldo, the Chief Technology Officer of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences who serves as the HCS faculty adviser, also said he was unaware that the majority of HCS’s email lists were public. He said he tends to have “a pretty loose connection with the Harvard Computing Society,” and that he played no role in setting up the group’s email list services.
Waldo said the default archive setting should have been private.
“The responsibility for determining whether the default is appropriate goes both to the people who are setting up the service and the people who are using the service,” he said. “The groups that knew that they were going to have people signing up who would want to have their identities not made public should have been aware of the ability to make their email list private when they signed up.”
Many HCS list users said they were surprised and concerned to learn their emails were publicly available. In particular, former Queer Resource Center staffer Marshall Craig ’16 said he was alarmed that the internal correspondence and membership of campus BGLTQ groups, including the Resource Center, had been discoverable by anyone with Internet access.
“Because it was managed by HCS, our understanding was that this was private—we were never given any indication to the contrary, and were never aware of any security concerns,” he said. “We feel strongly that identifying as BGLTQ is a personal decision, and concerned essentially that people will be outed against their will.”
Berkeley Brown ’18, the former chair of the Undergraduate Council’s Student Life Committee who previously maintained an HCS list for the body, said she was shocked to hear the majority of archived HCS emails were publicly available.
"Oh my god, yeah, every organization on campus I feel like uses the HCS lists, so, wow,” she said. “I can definitely see how it would be concerning for some groups, for sure.”
HCS took steps over the weekend to secure private information on its email server, first restricting access to the archives of all existing lists whose membership is private. HCS also sent emails to every single list administrator Saturday evening reminding them of their list’s privacy setting.
The group is additionally working to update the list creation process to “emphasize” the fact that the default setting for HCS email archives is public, according to Goodman. He added HCS will “reevaluate their default values” going forward. In the meantime, HCS temporarily disabled the email list directory Monday, Goodman wrote in an emailed statement.
Harvard sent its own messages to inform College affiliates who manage HCS email lists that their emails were public. Last week, the Freshman Dean’s Office and tutors from Adams, Pforzheimer, and Kirkland Houses made their archives private.
Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair wrote in an emailed statement Sunday that her office was working to ensure student privacy.
“OSL stands ready to assist any recognized student organization that has been impacted by this issue,” she wrote.
Current and former teaching fellows who relied on the lists for communication—including staff for Societies of the World 24: “Global Health Challenges: Complexities of Evidence-Based Policy,” a class offered this semester—also made their internal communications private last week.
In addition to SW 24 TFs, instructors for at least three other Harvard courses—Science of the Physical Universe 27: “Science and Cooking: From Haute Cuisine to Soft Matter Science,” Computer Science 51: “Introduction to Computer Science II,” and Economics 10a: “Principles of Economics”—left sensitive course information public.
Former CS 51 teaching fellow Randy J. Miller ’13 said he did not know he had inadvertently exposed private course information. He said he alone—and not other CS 51 affiliates or HCS staffers—was to blame.
“This was a long time ago, but I assume this is probably entirely my fault and not that of CS 51 because I was just doing this kind of thing on my own,” Miller said.
Jacob H. Rooksby, an associate dean at Duquesne University School of Law who specializes in intellectual property law as it relates to higher education, said the public dissemination of students’ academic information, though unintentional, “pretty clearly” constitutes a violation of FERPA.
Marc S. Rotenberg ’82, the president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center who has testified before Congress about online privacy issues, agreed with Rooksby.
"There are likely several privacy claims against the university if confidential student information was improperly disclosed,” Rotenberg wrote in an emailed statement.
Rooksby added that, if the Department of Education were to find Harvard in violation of FERPA, penalties resulting from either private claims or federal action would likely be insignificant.
“To me, there’s no private course of action,” he said. “The one and only possible penalty is that the Department of Education might remove federal funding, but that’s not going to happen—it has never happened in the history of FERPA.”
“At most, they would investigate and see if the practice had a pattern of repeatedly occurring. If so, they would write up a letter asking Harvard to rectify the situation, and give them time to do so,” Rooksby added.
Dane wrote in an emailed statement Monday that the University had “no comment” on the potential FERPA violation.
Waldo said teaching fellows should have “known better” than to send sensitive information over email lists run by students and thus not required to meet University information security standards.
Still, he said he thought the teaching fellows’ behavior, which he called “unwise,” did not merit a FERPA investigation.
“FERPA is really for systematic violations that are intentional of the right to privacy of the students. As far as I can tell, it does not outlaw being careless or stupid,” Waldo said.

UPDATED: February 21, 2017 at 4:51 p.m.
 Viola Davis, a two-time Emmy and Tony-winning actress, was named the 2017 Artist of the Year by the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations on Friday afternoon.
Davis earned two Primetime Emmy awards for her work in the television series “How to Get Away with Murder” and Tony Awards for her roles in “King Hedley II” and “Fences.” She also received critical acclaim for her acting in films such as “The Help” and “Doubt," and won a Golden Globe last month for her "Fences" performance.
“This year, Viola Davis really stood out to everybody, as her contributions, personality, and recognitions have been just stellar,” Cengiz Cemaloğlu ’18, a Foundation intern, wrote in an email. “We felt like this was the right time, the right place, and the right recognition for her efforts.”
Previous recipients of the Artist of the Year award include Lucy Liu, Eva Longoria, LL Cool J, John Legend, and Shakira.
University President Drew G. Faust will present an arts medal to Davis at a ceremony in Sanders Theatre on March 4 during the Foundation's annual Cultural Rhythms festival. The Harvard Foundation annually selects a “distinguished artist” to receive the Foundation’s artist medal for the award.
Cultural Rhythms highlights performances and food from student cultural organizations. This year, Harvard Bhangra Dance Company and the Asian American Dance Troupe are among the many student groups performing during the weeklong event.
Olutoyin Demuren ’18, an intern for the Foundation, wrote in an email that Cultural Rhythms began over 30 years ago to “celebrate the diversity of Harvard.”
“Cultural Rhythms provided space for the recognition and celebration of cultural performing groups and prominent artists of color who had been historically excluded from the main stage and the mainstream,” Demuren wrote.
Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair and Assistant Dean of Student Life Alexander R. Miller will attend a town hall at the festival's conclusion to discuss issues of diversity on campus. The town hall forum is one in a series of dialogue events throughout the week which will include topics on feminism, ethnic studies, and cultural affinity groups at Harvard.
Last year, Cultural Rhythms for the first time expanded to conversations on race in addition to the set of cultural performances, according to Demuren. The 2016 festival discussed the Faculty of Arts and Science’s decision to call House Masters Faculty Deans, as well as the 2016 presidential election.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Riffing on gender, sex, and her “crazy” college days during a raunchy 90-minute set, comedian Leslie Jones brought “Saturday Night Live” star power to a packed Sanders Theatre Friday night.
In a show sponsored by the Office of Student Life and the College Events Board, Jones—a cast member and writer on SNL also known for her role in last year’s “Ghostbusters”—mocked an audience of Harvard undergraduates for their intense study habits and subdued sex lives, teasing one student in particular for “taking notes” during the show.
“You look like you would pull out a chalkboard before you have sex,” Jones said of another student, miming scribbling equations on a board.
Amid loud applause, Jones opened her set by admitting that she would not have gotten into Harvard with her grade point average—but added that her “street smarts” far surpassed anyone’s in the audience.
Jones then ran over to marble statues of James Otis and Josiah Quincy on both sides of the stage and ridiculed their attire and poses. “You ain’t nobody man, you just got on a dress and some ugly ass shoes,” she said.
Warning the crowd that she was going to talk about “harsh reality,” Jones posed a challenge to the audience to count how many times she swore over the course of a frequently-profane set. “I want y’all to count how many curse words I say. Y’all so smart,” she said.
Launching into anecdotes about her personal and professional life, Jones mused on how fame has changed her from being “normal” to having “white folks make [her] take pictures with their babies.”
Jones also ruminated on gender roles, and described her approach to activism on women’s rights as simply “being a woman.”
“I mean, I’m 49 now, so I don’t picket to show that I have a uterus,” she said. “Be it, don’t say it. Do it. Live it.”
In an extended riff on why women are “crazy”—they have to “carry a human around in our body” like a backpack, she said—Jones concluded with a call for women to “embrace your crazy shit.”
Comedian Jon Laster opened for Jones, performing a short stand-up routine joking about President Donald Trump and poking fun at students’ concentrations.
Audience members received the show with mixed opinions: some, like Victoria Chan ’17, were surprised by Jones’ comedic tactics, like picking out people from the audience to joke about.
“It was more raunchy than I expected, but I think she talked a lot about things that we could relate to,” Chan said.
Others, like Amy Zhao ’18, appreciated Jones’ direct sense of humor.
“It was really cool how she wasn’t afraid to address some topics,” Zhao said, adding that Jones was “honestly such a riot.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinic filed Thursday an amicus brief challenging President Donald Trump’s seven-country immigration order.
A team of clinic staff, Law School students, and attorneys at New York-based firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom filed the brief  supporting a New York lawsuit against Trump’s order, which has faced legal challenges across the country. They argue that Trump’s order violates federal immigration statutes.
“But [the Immigration and Nationality Act] does not grant the President the far-reaching authority the Executive Order endeavors to exercise,” the brief reads.
The amicus brief is the latest in a series of actions the Law School clinic has taken to oppose Trump’s immigration and refugee-related policies. In particular, the clinic helped Harvard file an amicus brief challenging Trump’s order in the Ninth Circuit and  and published a report on a refugee agreement between Canada and the United States.
Nate MacKenzie, a Law School student who directed the team of student researchers who worked on the brief, said the clinic filed it to help the court better understand the various statutory arguments related to the suit.
“With the amicus brief that we recently filed in the New York case, we were working with the [American Civil Liberties Union] and we decided it would be best if we put together a brief outlining some ways that we suggest the court should look at interpreting the Immigration and Nationality Act, which is the law that governs pretty much all of immigration,” MacKenzie said.
MacKenzie said he worked closely with Phil Torrey, a clinical instructor at the Law School, and Sabi Ardalan, the assistant director of HIRC, along with four student research teams, to send memos to the law firm, which turned the research into the formal brief submitted to the court.
Torrey said the legal team focused its arguments on criticizing the legal justification Trump used for the executive order.
“We knew that the ACLU and other organizations were going to be arguing more Constitutional-based arguments and we thought that based on our knowledge and the arguments presented in the case initially that this would be a good place for us to way in and help advance that argument,” Torrey said.
MacKenzie said it’s unclear how exactly the current cases will turn out if Trump signs another immigration executive order this week, as his staff have said he will.
“I think that the interesting thing about this brief is that it’s pretty comprehensive over all of the provisions of the executive order and I think that it’ll be interesting moving forward to see if the President does come out with a new executive order this week,” MacKenzie said. “I would imagine the arguments would continue to be relevant regardless of how the cases take shape over the next couple of months.”
In addition to this amicus brief, the clinic is helping conduct research for the ACLU’s arguments in the New York case, according to MacKenzie. Torrey said the clinic is also working on a brief for an immigration-related case before the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council passed legislation allocating $1,000 to make tampons and other feminine hygiene products more available in freshman dorms.
The legislation, sponsored by Crimson Yard representative Arnav Agrawal ’20, passed unanimously. According to Agrawal, the tampons will be located in each of the four freshman yards. He said the Freshman Class Committee hopes to make the tampons easily accessible and combat “taboo” campus attitude towards menstruation.
“We want to focus on having the greatest geographical and popular impact in several locations,” he said at the UC’s general meeting. “We’re just going to provide them next to the condom dispensers that are formally in place in common rooms. So it has no relations with public bathrooms or in-suite bathrooms, it’s just going to be places where more people can access it.”
In presenting the legislation, Agrawal said he was happy to introduce legislation of the kind, adding that he finds students seldom discuss menstrual health at Harvard.
“There is a certain stigma with menstrual health on campus,” he said.
Agrawal said he will collecting feedback from students to measure the program’s success during the month-long pilot.
“We plan to conduct a midpoint survey after two weeks to gauge the effectiveness. We’ll also conduct a survey after the end of this month-long pilot project and we’ll also have a small town hall, where we can collect feedback from students,” he said.
UC President Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 asked Agrawal if there were measures in place to control whether or not the products would be distributed equally among students. Agrawal said he plans on monitoring the tampon supply in order to prohibit students from taking too many.
Agrawal’s legislation passed unanimously with a hand vote.
Afterwards, Eliot Representative Mati C. M. Reed ’19 presented legislation funding student events with the Council’s Grant for an Open Harvard College. Council members said they were concerned about funding for a Sexuality, Health, Intimacy, Partnership party—the group requested over $4,000, but was eventually only granted $1,000—as well as funding for Presencia Latina and Brown Sugar, an annual event that the Council declined to fund through the grant.
The grant typically funds unique student events under five compelling interests: mental health, race relations, sexual assault and harassment, social spaces, and financial accesibility.
Pointing to the Financial Committee’s specific rules concerning the funding of recurring events, Sachee and UC Vice President Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18 proposed an amendment to send Presencia Latina and Brown Sugar’s funding request to the Financial Committee. The committee will most likely discuss the request at their next meeting Wednesday.
“Even if they were to get a small amount of funding, I still think it’s important procedure for them to go through FiCom first, as they are a recognized student organization and FiCom should be their main funding source,” Khansarinia said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Throughout Harvard’s capital campaign, the refrain has been constant: despite the University’s rapid fundraising success, it would not raise its $6.5 billion goal.
But, in an apparent deviation from fundraising practice at the rest of the University, the Business School announced last week that it will seek to raise an additional $300 million after having reached its $1 billion goal.
Like other schools, the Business School will raise the money to fulfill remaining priorities in its capital campaign, but it is the only school at Harvard that has announced a new fundraising figure as part of that effort.
In an interview earlier this month, University President Drew G. Faust reiterated that Harvard’s overall goal will remain the same, but that the University will focus on areas in which it has not yet reached its goals.
“I think Harvard Business School just decided it would say ‘let’s keep going,’ and it’s fine; that’s their goal,” Faust said. “But our goal overall is the same.”
Faust added that the Business School did consult with the University’s central administration before announcing their additional $300 million goal.
“They said they really felt they wanted to do that, because it motivates their donors very much to have a goal, to be competitive, so they wanted to do it and we said go ahead,” Faust said.
Other Ivy League universities, including Columbia, have upped their fundraising goals during successful capital campaigns. Harvard surpassed its $6.5 billion goal last year, and the current campaign is the first Harvard has conducted University-wide.
Ellen Harkavy, director of the Business School’s campaign, wrote in an email that the school is not raising its official fundraising goal.
“But having surpassed our $1B target, we have set our sights internally on raising an additional $300M for our four key priority areas: HBS Fund, associate professorships, MBA fellowships, and realizing the vision of ‘One Harvard’,” Harkavy wrote.
Harkavy said the additional $300 million will go towards fulfilling the Business School’s “unfilled buckets” of need. Rather than set an internal benchmark for meeting the remaining priorities, as the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and several other campaigns are currently doing, the Business School decided to make the matter public.
Higher education fundraising expert Arthur Criscillis said it is not unusual for campaigns to reach the overall goal, but not individual targets within that goal.
“That happens in far more campaigns than not,” Criscillis said.
Before schools decide on their fundraising goals, Michael T. Kerr ’81, co-chair of the Harvard College Fund, said they come up with their needs and formulate a “wish list.” Kerr said that list is modified to fit the projected capacity of alumni donors, and that a school’s actual fundraising needs are often higher than the stated goal.
“In almost every case, and for most of the schools, that need, that potential need, is greater than what you set as your target simply because you have all this benchmarking,” Kerr said, referring to setting campaign goals against goals at institutions with similar alumni bases.
Kerr said campaign organizers are also able to predict what gifts they will receive.
“So you create a target. You never want to create a campaign target that you don’t accomplish,” Kerr said. “That’s just like a cardinal rule of fundraising, and if you’re an institutional fundraiser like Harvard with the reputation of Harvard, if Harvard sets a $6.5 billion target, we’d better make it.”
Kerr said he did not have an answer for why the Business School was announcing a public figure, while other campaigns are internally shifting gears.
“Maybe because they’re the Business School,” Kerr said. “I think the University and probably the FAS, our feeling is that we want to keep working with donors on specific needs, specific projects that we want to get funded, and we’d rather do it that way.”
The University’s fundraising drive will end in 2018.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The opponents that the Harvard women’s tennis team faced at last weekend’s ECAC Championships were familiar ones for the Crimson. Harvard was paired with Cornell and Brown in the two-day tournament held at the Murr Center. The Crimson split its matches, edging the Big Red on Saturday before falling to the Bears the next day.
“I was really happy with the way our team competed this weekend,” Harvard coach Traci Green said. “It’s always fun to get an early look at some of our Ivy opponents. Both matches were fought tooth and nail by everyone on our team. There were moments in the match where it could have gone either way and I was really proud of our team that we were so resilient even though we weren’t able to get the doubles point in either of the matches.”
The team (4-5) will travel to Brown (3-2) for an Ivy League clash on Apr. 7 before heading to Ithaca eight days later to take on Cornell (3-3). Sophomore Erica Oosterhout led the way for Harvard on the weekend, picking up wins at the No. 1 position on both days and pushing her singles win streak to four.
BROWN, 4, HARVARD, 1
For the second day in a row, the Crimson dropped the all-important doubles point as a victory by junior Annika Ringblom and sophomore Sabrina Xiong proved to be for naught after the upperclassman duo of Alyza Benotto and Dayna Lord won at the top spot for the Bears and Maddie Stearns and Mariska Chamdani followed suit at No. 2.
Following her doubles loss, Oosterhout got off to a slow start in singles, dropping the first set to Lord, 6-1. However, the Tampa, Fla. native would not let the senior get the best of her twice in one day. Oosterhout rolled to a 6-2 win in the second before picking up a gutsy 6-4 win in the decisive set.
The win was a big one for Oosterhout as the sophomore was able to best a player who has been a unanimous First Team All-Ivy pick during each of her first three seasons in Providence. Just a week earlier, Oosterhout defeated Boston College’s Asiya Dair, the No. 104 player in the nation.
“In general, I was really proud of the way Erica stepped up in the number one spot,” Green said. “She played against two tough Ivy opponents and she was able to show her resilience and come back after losing the first set. She’s been playing well and she’s been competing even better.”
Freshman Natasha Gonzalez was the only other Crimson player to take her match into a third set. After dropping the first set, 6-2, the Houston native roared back in the second to win six of the nine games but ultimately could not pull off the comeback over Brown sophomore Taylor Cosme and fell in the third, 6-1.
Freshman Irene Lu took her second set to a tiebreaker but lost to fellow first-year Devon Jack. Captain June Lee fell to Benotto at No.2, 6-3, 6-1.
“With Brown, we lost the doubles point but really fought back in singles and there was a point in the match where it was very close to being tied, we had all three-set matches [at one point],” Lee said. “It was a solid weekend, definitely more work to do with doubles.”
HARVARD, 4, CORNELL, 3
Harvard pushed its win streak to four on Saturday after coming out on top in another back-and-forth match. Six days after using a frantic singles comeback to beat Georgetown, the Crimson took four of the day’s six singles matches to oust Cornell.
Lee and Oosterhout fell 6-4 in the top doubles pairing while Xiong and Ringblom lost six of their eight games to Madison Stevens and Lizzie Stewart. Across the board, singles matches on Saturday were extremely competitive. The individual matches for Lee, Oosterhout, and Ringblom all went three sets.
Lee took the first set over senior Alexandra D’Ascenzo but fell 6-1, 6-2 in the second and third. Oosterhout dropped her first set to Marika Cusick but took the second to set up a decisive third. The match went to a tiebreaker but Oosterhout came out on top, 7-5. Ringblom got the better of Stewart in their second meeting of the morning, ousting the junior, 5-7, 6-3, 6-1.
Lu and Gonzalez both picked up straight set victories while fellow freshman Jenna Friedel fell to junior Priyanka Shah at No. 3.
“It was really good for our team, especially for the freshmen because it’s basically like playing Ivies but not during Ivies so it’s really good to see where we’re at compared to each school,” captain June Lee said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Prior to Friday night, Harvard wrestling had dropped four straight matches. The most recent—a 23-12 defeat to Brown on Feb. 10—had pushed the Crimson to 1-4 in conference play and carried the extra indignity of occurring at home.
Three weeks of losing clouded over the team, and there was no obvious reprieve. A four-hour bus ride to Hempstead, N.Y. appeared unlikely to lift the gloominess. Nor, at least initially, did a matchup against Hofstra (6-11, 2-6 EIWA) seem like the cure: In the first two contests, freshman Connor Sakmar and sophomore Samuel Goldman lost to open a 6-0 chasm.
What Harvard needed was a sparkplug, some fiery jolt of energy. In which case, it’s a good thing that the visitors brought A.J. Jaffee.
In the third matchup of the day, the freshman pinned his opponent to tie the score and reenergize the Crimson. Harvard (3-8, 2-6 EIWA) proceeded to take the next five bouts, ending the night with a 28-9 win.
Besides breaking the losing streak, the victory let the Crimson begin preparations for the EIWA Championships with a touch of momentum. On March 3, the program will head to Lewisburg, Pa. for what looms as the largest test of the season.
Harvard’s performance over the two-day event will fossilize this season as a success or a failure. Moreover, the EIWA Championships gives wrestlers a chance to qualify for the NCAA Championships later in March—both as a team and individuals.
Jaffe will be one of those athletes vying for a bid. On Friday, however, he could content himself with reversing the course of the dual meet.
The other highlight of the night came when fellow freshman Kyle Bierdumpfel smacked his opponent, 17-3, for a win by major decision. The 165-lb. wrestler now owns an 11-9 record over his career.
Many other teammates claimed wins—just not so lopsidedly. Freshman Hunter Ladnier and senior Colby Night followed up Jaffe’s pin with a pair of victories by decision. And after Bierdumpfel’s domination, co-captain Josef Johnson and senior Kanon Dean respectively won 8-2 and 9-4 by decision.
Although junior Logan Kirby fell 7-4 by decision at 197 lbs., that result had no effect on the outcome of the dual meet. Aided by a forfeit in the final weight category, Harvard escaped Hofstra with the 28-9 victory.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Crimson (19-4, 7-3 Ivy League) had split results this weekend, ultimately falling one victory short of sweeping the regular season series against the Gentlemen C’s. After a tough 58-55 win over the Columbia Lions (13-10, Ivy 3-7) on Friday night, the Crimson dropped Saturday afternoon’s game to the Cornell Big Red, 57-52. The loss was Harvard’s first to the Big Red (14-9, 5-5) since 2008.
CORNELL 57, HARVARD 52
Harvard, falling behind once again after a strong first half against an Ancient Eight opponent, was unable to recover late in the game and suffered a road loss against Cornell.
“Very disappointed. We didn’t show up on the offensive end, I’m not sure why but we struggled to score and it’s very perplexing,” coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “The people that you depend on just didn’t show up.”
Despite double digit points from budding guards freshman Katie Benzan and sophomore Madeline Raster, as well as co-captain Destiny Nunley, Harvard was unable to overcome the senior-heavy Big Red team. Statistically, the Crimson appeared to control the game, but it was the intangibles that plagued the youth squad.
“They know who they are going against, they’re going against a Cornell team that starts five seniors,” coach Delaney-Smith said. “There were periods of time where [Cornell] just wanted it more. I don’t know how to fix that—that [responsibility] belongs to the players. They have to get each other to not let that happen again.”
Heading into the second half, Harvard led 29-24 and seemed poised to put distance between them and the experienced Big Red. Earning a road victory in Ithaca, NY, eluded the team, however, as a poor shooting effort in the 3rd quarter brought Cornell within a single score of the Crimson. A mixture of uncharacteristically reserved shooting from Harvard and quality minutes from Cornell’s freshman guard Samantha Widmann resulted in the Big Red setting itself up for the comeback.
“We’ll have to get back to the drawing board and realize we have to play for 40 minutes,” Nunley said. “Sometimes we play for 25 minutes or 38 minutes, but not the whole 40—and that’s what it takes, especially in the Ivy League, where everybody is fighting for those top four spots in the tournament.”
The pressure of the moment appeared to get the best of the youthful Crimson squad, as it committed seven of its 17 personal fouls in the fourth quarter. Cornell took due advantage: after it sunk a three-pointer to take the lead with eight minutes remaining in the contest, the home team capped off the comeback on the play of Widmann and the senior starters. Widmann ended up scoring a season-high 15 points off the bench for the Big Red.
“This loss lit a fire under us, more so than other games that we’ve lost before,” Nunley said. “This Cornell loss is hard for us, and everybody is taking it to heart and looking in the mirror, asking themselves, ‘What is that I need to do better?’”
HARVARD 58, COLUMBIA 55
Harvard nearly fell victim to its inability to extend an early lead at Levien Gymnasium in New York City. However, Nunley’s dominant performance, along with quality play from Benzan and junior forward Taylor Rooks, allowed the Crimson to hold on for a nail-biter for its seventh Ivy League victory.
Nunley would nearly record a double-double, scoring 20 points and collecting seven boards. The play from the Texas native provided the boost that Harvard was looking for on a night where the usually prolific 3-point shooting was absent and many dependable players struggled.
“Things that we have been doing well all year long weren’t happening. We did really well defensively both nights,” Delaney-Smith said. “Offensively we lost our confidence; we lost our toughness; we really haven’t put 40 minutes together on the offensive end.”
Although the Crimson, for the most part, were able to control the game defensively, Columbia’s junior forward Camille Zimmerman had a big night against Harvard. Zimmerman recorded a double-double, scoring 28 points and collecting 12 rebounds. Zimmerman carried the home squad as she was the only player to record double digits in either points or rebounds.
“She’s definitely a scorer,” Nunley said. “I’m kind of upset that the coaches put me on her and she still had a 28-point game. You give her an inch and she’ll let the ball fly, and nine times out of ten it’s going in.”
The Crimson defense, however, adjusted accordingly, and forced Zimmerman’s teammates to make plays.
“I think the team did well adjusting and playing everyone else harder, because we know that putting pressure on the other players will alter their play, and she can’t win the whole game for them,” Nunley said.
Harvard’s shooting at the freethrow line would prove to be crucial, as they posted a 73 percentage from the line. The routinely clutch free throw shooting from sophomore Sydney Skinner would put Harvard over the top, as she sunk three of four from the charity stripe to secure Harvard the win.
The Crimson, who have a short practice week, will be on the road again next weekend to take on the Brown Bears and Yale Bulldogs. The Bulldogs had a dominant victory over the Penn Quakers Saturday night, 61-48. Harvard has a lot to work on in a short amount of time if it wants to repeat its 20-point victory on the road against that school down in Connecticut.
“We’re going to go back to individual work and try to get back some toughness and remind them of their skill set, which is very good,” Delaney-Smith said. “For whatever reason they aren’t playing like they know that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Playing in its final games of the 2016-2017 season, the Harvard women’s ice hockey team (5-19-5, 5-13-4 ECAC) faced off against two Ivy league rivals in Yale (10-15-4, 8-12-2) and Brown (7-22-0, 5-17-0) at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center over the weekend. After beating Yale 5-0 on Friday, the Crimson fell to Brown 3-1 in its final game of the season.
HARVARD 1, BROWN 3
Despite controlling the action for most of the game, Harvard lost its season closer, 3-1, to Brown, spoiling the home team's honoring of its six seniors directly following the game.The Bears set the stage by scoring the game’s opening goal at 16:06 on an unassisted shot by freshman forward Sena Hanson.
The Crimson controlled much of the action in the second period, but were unable to score. With 8:25 remaining, Brown junior forward Samantha Swanstrom saw her shot tipped into the goal to double the Bears’ lead.
Harvard pulled to within one at 13:39 in the third period. On the power play, senior forward Briana Mastel swung the puck to senior defender Abbey Frazer who fired a shot into a crowd around the net. Junior forward Lexie Laing scooped up the open puck and shot it into the goal for the score. With 1:40 remaining, the Crimson pulled its goalkeeper in an attempt to tie the score and send the game into overtime. However, after a blocked shot at 19:24, Hanson scooped up the puck and skated to the other end to score Brown’s third goal of the day.
After the game, the team took the time to celebrate its graduating seniors. Brianna Laing, Natasha Rachlin, Mastel, Frazer, Molly Tissenbaum and Sydney Daniels had all played their final games for Harvard. The Crimson in the class of 2017 combined for 73 wins over four years.
HARVARD 5, YALE 0
In the its first game of the weekend, Harvard came out shooting against Yale in what would end up being a 5-0 victory for the team. The shutout was the Crimson’s second and goalkeeper Brianna Laing’s first of the year.
Harvard’s first goal came at 6:41 in the first period. On the power play, Lexie Laing’s shot bounced off of the frame of the goal, but Daniels was able to grab the rebound and score.
Daniels would again score in the second period to double the Crimson’s lead. At 6:58, Mastel carried the puck down the left side of the rink before swinging a pass to a cutting Daniels for the score, her 11th of the year. The multi-point outing was Daniels’ 18th of her career. In addition, her goal, the 59th of her career, moved her into 15th all time on Harvard’s career goals list.
Five minutes later, at 11:47, the Crimson scored again. Sophomore forward Bradley Fusco intercepted a Yale pass near the goal. After carrying the puck around the back of the net, she found sophomore forward Kate Hallet, whose one-timer sneaked past Yale’s goalie.
Just before the second intermission, at 19:33, Mastel found junior defender Chelsea Ziadie, whose shot went into the top corner of the goal. The goal was Ziadie’s third of the season as well as her third in the past five games.
Harvard continued its attack into the third period. At 16:16, Rachlin and freshman forward Kat Hughes played the puck to Lexie Laing in transition. Laing then skated past a pair of Yale defenders before firing a shot into the top corner of the goal, Harvard’s fifth of the day.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If a team’s opening game sets the tone for its season, then the Harvard women’s lacrosse team is on track for a successful year.
The Crimson (1-0) kicked off its season in decisive fashion on Saturday, riding a dominant offensive performance to an 18-11 win over the University of New Hampshire (0-1) in Durham, N.H.
“Overall, the team played together as a unit,” junior midfielder Julia Glynn said. “Being our first game, there are definitely things that will need adjusting. However, there were also a lot of things that looked great. It was an exciting first game and a great team win.”
Despite the uneven final scoreline, Harvard got off to a slow start. UNH found the back of the Crimson net just over a minute after the opening whistle, and the Wildcats would hold that lead for much of the first half.
The second stanza was a different story, as Harvard’s attack exploded for 10 goals to pull away from UNH. Leading the effort were senior attacker Marisa Romeo and sophomore midfielder Keeley MacAfee, who each picked up four scores and an assist.
Spearheaded by the duo, the Crimson offense overwhelmed UNH’s defensive unit.  Although the Wildcats were more efficient in front of goal, scoring 11 times on 23 chances, Harvard shot nearly twice as much, taking 43 over the course of the game.
The Crimson also dominated every other attacking statistic. Harvard picked up 23 ground balls to its opponent’s 12 and went three-for-five on free position chances, while the Wildcats only converted once on the same number of free position opportunities. The Crimson’s 18 draw controls also outdid UNH’s 13.
Cruising behind the efforts of its red-hot offense, Harvard was able to put the game to bed with ease in the second stanza despite a nervy first half characterized by frequent lead changes.
After UNH opened the scoring just 83 seconds into the match, tri-captain attacker Maeve McMahon leveled for the Crimson. The Wildcats found the back of the net again two minutes later, but Romeo dragged Harvard even once again with the first of her three game-tying goals over the course of the afternoon.
Romeo would knot the score at 4-4 later in the half after sophomore attacker Nicole Baiocco converted a free position shot to bring the Crimson within one point.
Baiocco, MacAfee, and McMahon each chipped in a finish before Romeo equalized yet again with two seconds remaining in the first half, sending the teams into the break with eight goals each.
The unassisted conversion from Romeo capped a turbulent final three minutes of the opening stanza. With 2:57 left in the period, UNH senior attacker Devon Croke scored twice to bring the Wildcats level and then give them the lead, before Romeo snapped the opposition’s scoring run in the final moments of the half.
Riding the momentum of Romeo’s goal, the Harvard defense picked up its game after the restart. The Crimson cut UNH’s production rate in half as it limited the Wildcats to a mere seven shots in the second stanza. With the Harvard back line hindering UNH’s efforts on goal, junior goalkeeper Meredith Brown was only forced to make two of her seven total saves in the second half.
Meanwhile, the Crimson attack had found another gear, improving on its shot total from the first half as it buried the Wildcats with three unanswered goals in the first five minutes.
MacAfee and Romeo each collected another finish, and freshman midfielder Katie Muldoon scored the first goal of her Harvard career. Glynn also scored what would turn out to be the game-winning point to push the Crimson’s lead to four, 12-8.
UNH tried to start a comeback with a score halfway through the period, but the Harvard offense would not be stopped.
The Crimson put away five goals in as many minutes with no response from the Wildcats, sealing the result.
The finishes came from a range of class years, as sophomore attacker Rosemary Scalise, junior attacker Eliza Guild, and senior defender Marina Burke each chipped in a goal. MacAfee also converted twice to open and close the scoring run.
With the margin sitting at 17-9 in Harvard’s favor, UNH refused to give up. The Wildcats found the back of the Crimson net twice in the final ten minutes, but the game was already out of reach, and tri-captain midfielder Megan Hennessey scored on a free position chance in the last 20 seconds to put an exclamation point on the win.
“I think that this weekend was a good start to our season, and it’s always nice to get a win on the road under our belt early on,” Hennessey said. “We have a lot to work on going forward and are excited to get back to work this week.”
The victory highlighted a revitalized Harvard attack, as the team topped its averages from last season in nearly every category. Harvard outdid its 2016 per-game averages in shots, goals, draw controls, and free position conversion in Saturday’s matchup.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend, the Harvard men’s tennis team traveled to Princeton, N.J. to compete in the ECAC Division I Indoor Championships with hopes of a repeat performance of last year’s third place finish. After an early elimination from finals play on Friday, the team ended the weekend with a 1-2 record.
Ranked as the number six seed in the tournament, the Crimson (6-4) was eliminated on Friday with a 4-2 defeat to third-ranked Princeton (4-4). The team went on to split the consolation matches, sweeping Yale (5-3) on Saturday before losing a close-fought match against Penn (6-4) on Sunday.
“Everyone fought extremely hard,” sophomore Andy Zhou said. “There were a few points up and down that didn’t go our way, but I think in the future we will be starting to see a lot of the points come in our direction.”
PENN 4, HARVARD 2
Losing the doubles point off two consecutive 7-6 tiebreaker defeats, Harvard was unable to rally back in singles play, falling 4-2 to close out the match.
The doubles pair of junior Kenny Tao and senior Brian Yeung won their third consecutive doubles match this weekend, giving the Crimson an edge at first doubles. Harvard’s second and third doubles pairs were defeated in close tiebreakers, however, ending the Crimson’s streak of three straight doubles point victories that began with last week’s blowout of Boise State.
“Overall our doubles have been improving.” junior co-captain Jean Thirouin said. “ We had a few injuries keeping us from putting up our usual lineup but everyone who played stepped up and competed really well.”
Both Zhou and junior Grant Solomon continued their solid performances from Saturday, defeating Penn’s fourth and fifth singles competitors, respectively. Sophomore Samuel Beren, in Harvard’s sixth singles slot, started off with a strong 6-3 first set win, but could not close out a second set tiebreaker, ultimately falling 6-2 in the final set. The remaining three matchups all went to three sets, but both Tao and Yeung dropped the last set of their matches, giving Penn a hard-fought victory.
HARVARD 4, YALE 0
The Crimson started the second day of competition strong on Saturday against Yale. Harvard seized the doubles point to begin the contest, with victories from the Crimson’s leading duo of Tao and Yeung as well as sophomore Christopher Morrow and freshman Logan Weber at third doubles.
“Although the score was 4-0 the overall match was much closer.” Thirouin said.  “We knew they would be a tough team so we came out strong and never let up.”
In singles play, Harvard quickly executed a resounding sweep of the Bulldogs, clinching victories across the ladder. No. 2 Yeung, carrying the momentum from a strong doubles performance, led the Crimson to its first singles point with a 6-2, 6-3 victory against Yale freshman Dylan King. Zhou followed, delivering Harvard’s second single point with a 6-3, 6-3 win.
“I’m getting a good feeling of what that feels like and what it takes to win points effectively and efficiently,” Zhou said. “I came back pretty strong as there was a lot of motivation for me coming off that loss to Princeton, and I was definitely very focused on the court.”
With a three-set victory by Solomon in the fifth singles, the Crimson emerged victorious.
PRINCETON 4, HARVARD 2
On Friday, Harvard first fell in the opening round of the ECAC Championships against the third-seeded Princeton. A strong 6-4 win from co-captain Sebastian Beltrame and Thirouin at second doubles was followed by a victory from Tao and Yeung at first doubles.
Tao went on to claim a victory at first singles as well, in a 6-4, 6-1 win over Tiger senior Alex Day. Other than Tao’s win, however, Princeton swept the remaining singles matches. Only Beren, at sixth singles, managed to push his match into the third set, as Yeung, Zhou, and Solomon all fell in straight sets.
“I had a rough start to the weekend and lost a hard-fought one to Princeton,” Zhou said. “I think it was due to getting used to the conditions and having first-day jitters.”
It was with this defeat that the team was eliminated from finals contention, unable to follow up on last year’s third place finish in the same tournament.
The Crimson looks to bounce back next Sunday as it hosts Memphis and Boston University home at the Murr Tennis Center.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s volleyball team (4-5, 2-2 EIVA) finished this weekend’s road trip to Pennsylvania with split results, winning in a close match at St. Francis (6-9, 3-3) following a shutout loss to No. 13 Penn St. (9-5, 4-1) the night before.
HARVARD 3, ST. FRANCIS 2
The Crimson looked to bounce back from Friday night’s loss as the team faced St. Francis in what proved to be another close game. Deadlocked at two sets apiece, the two teams were forced to compete in a fifth set to break the tie, which Harvard took, 17-15, to claim victory.
“We started a little bit slow, especially at the beginning of the first couple sets,” said junior middle blocker Riley Moore. “That’s been kind of an issue for us so far this season—finishing out matches.”
The Crimson rallied behind the performance of freshman setter Matthew Ctvrtlik. The California-native recorded 13 kills and 21 digs in Saturday’s win.
“Matt really played well. He had an all-around game,” senior co-captain Casey White said. “He dug balls and put some away, which was a little bit of a different situation than we’ve ever put him in, but really pulled through for us.”
With 11 kills and 11 digs, White posted his fifth double-double of the season.
Harvard fell by two points to St. Francis in the first set, 25-23, before answering with a 25-16 second set to even the score. The two teams then repeated the scores of the first two frames, with the Red Flash taking the third set 25-23 and the Crimson responding with a score of 25-16 in the fourth. Thus the stage was set for the teams to battle for it all in one final frame.
Under the pressure of facing a fifth set on the road, Harvard sought to maintain an element of composure in their play.
“We were trying to stay focused and make sure that everyone was doing their part, especially with a kind of hostile crowd in a really tight match,” Moore said.
Focused the Crimson indeed stayed, as the team closed the decisive fifth set with a .353 hitting percentage. Harvard was able to cap the weekend with a hard-fought 3-2 win over St. Francis.
“We are glad we were able to come out with a win this weekend after facing adversity due to injuries,” junior settler Marko Kostich said. “It was the first away in-conference weekend, and we knew it was important to earn wins early on in a competitive EIVA.”
NO. 13 PENN STATE 3, HARVARD 0
Despite holding multiple leads in three tightly-played sets, the Crimson was unable to leave Penn State’s Rec Hall with a win Friday night.
“We blew a couple of pretty sizable leads, which was definitely a bummer,” said Moore, who lead the team with three blocks on the evening.
The Nittany Lions opened their 3-0 run with a 25-17 win in the first set, holding Harvard to a .121 attack percentage.
Going into the second frame, both teams went point-for-point before the Crimson pulled to a three-point lead, going up 10-7. That lead was then extended to four, as Harvard went ahead 12-8. However, Penn State proved resilient, as they battled back to tie the set at 19 and again at 33 for the set point. Behind the efforts of Penn State senior Matt Callaway and junior Aidan Albrecht, the Lions took the long set 35-33 following a kill apiece from the pair.
The Crimson looked to bounce back early in the third set with back-to-back kills from junior Brad Gretsch. A strong .310 attack from Penn State overwhelmed Harvard, which struggled with what Moore referred to as “giving up easy points.” The Nittany Lions took the final set 25-22 to cap off a clean sweep.
“We have a lot of youth on the team, so you expect some variance in how you’re going to play, which we saw,” White said. “We played very well at the beginning of the match, but when it got down to crunch time we kind of folded a little bit.”
White led the Crimson with 12 kills in the contest against the Lions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard skiing team ended its regular season this weekend at the Middlebury Winter Carnival, where it finished 10th out of the 15 teams in the Eastern Intercollegiate Skiing Association. Dartmouth continued its dominance, placing first overall for the Big Green’s fourth carnival win of the season.
Conditions at the Rikert Nordic Center in Ripton, Vermont were ideal Friday after a week of snow, and warm temperatures on Saturday brought out a sizeable crowd to watch the races.
“It was a really supportive and loud group of people,” junior Kelly Steeves said. “Results-wise, it was a bit challenging, as the field is really deep this year, but everyone skied quite well.”
The Crimson was able to notch top ten marks in both the Men’s and Women’s Classic Sprint Relays. For the men, senior Devlin Shea and freshman William Rhatigan skied to a ninth place finish with a combined time of 22:03.0, while on the women’s side, senior captain Rachel Hampton along with sophomore Hannah Hardenbergh earned ninth place, posting a time of 24:09.5.
Hampton continued her strong showing with a top finish for Harvard in the 15K FS, coming in 22nd at 42:54.3. She was followed by Hardenbergh who crossed the line 33rd, at 44:27.5.
In the men’s 20K FS, Rhatigan finished first of the Crimson skiers at 31st place overall, with a time of 50.09.1. Seniors Ian Meyer and Devlin Shea also scored in the event, placing 40th and 42nd respectively. They were followed by sophomore Connor Green who came in 59th and freshman Mackinley Fitzpatrick who finished 60th.
The alpine skiers were led by a strong performance from Steeves, who finished 33rd overall in giant slalom with a time of 2:12.74 and 35th overall in women’s slalom with a combined run time of 1:48.73. For the men’s side, freshman Carter Kendig finished 55th in giant slalom with a time of 2:09.15.
“The big goal for our season qualitatively was to do a better job making race day performance a lot more like what we see out of the athletes during training,” alpine head coach Tim Mitchell said. “For the most part, I think we did a pretty good job of transitioning the stuff we’ve been working on in practice into the race.”
Next weekend the team will look to continue acting on this goal as it competes in the NCAA Regional Championships at Sunday River Ski Resort in Maine.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The crowd packed into the Murr Center on Sunday stood in anticipation. The No. 2 Harvard men’s squash team was looking to claw its way out of a 4-2 hole to victory against No. 1 Trinity in the CSA Men’s National Team Championship finals. The feat seemed increasingly possible with each passing second. But those hopes and dreams faded in an instant.
Freshman Saadeldin Abouaish began the Crimson’s rally, besting Trinity freshman Kush Kumar in three games at the first position. It was now up to freshman Timmy Brownell and co-captain Bryan Koh to finish off the upset.
Down 2-1 in games, Brownell stared down championship point against Bantam sophomore Michael Craig. With the game score at 10-6, the rookie couldn’t slip up. Conservative play and dogged determination proved to be a recipe for success, as Brownell fought tooth and nail to get within one point of tying up the match, 10-9.
Long rallies persisted. Without any regard for his body, the Belmont, Mass. native dove prone in all four corners of the court to secure balls on increasingly well placed shots from Craig. But after three let calls to extent the play on the fourth match point for his opponent, Brownell finally buckled.
With the victory secured, a raucous group of Trinity players gleefully stormed the court and hoisted Craig in the air in celebration of the Bantams’ 16th national title in the past 20 years. During the commotion, Koh did his part in claiming his own five-set victory, but the achievement proved to be inconsequential in terms of the final result. Harvard (13-2, 7-0 Ivy League) went home empty handed in its loss, 5-4.
“While the final result [in Sunday’s match] was disappointing, our guys played some real tough squash,” freshman Sean Hughes said. “I think everyone really left all they had out on the court and you can't ask for much more than that.”
On its route to the finals against Trinity (19-1, 6-0 NESCAC), the Crimson bested No. 3 Columbia (12-4, 6-1 Ivy) and No. 7 Yale (8-9, 5-2 Ivy) in matches that were dissimilar to their regular season counterparts. As the group reflects on this year’s campaign, it hopes to further build upon the strong team dynamic that led to its performances.
“On the season as a whole, as a freshman, I was really happy to be part of such a welcoming team,” Hughes said. “The culture on the team is outstanding and everyone pushes each other on and off the field. We had a lot of great performances this year and I'm looking forward to big things in the next three.”
HARVARD 4, TRINITY 5
Harvard couldn’t topple the titan. In a match that closely mirrored the contest between the bitter foes just two weeks ago, victory was just out of reach for the Crimson.
Hughes and co-captain Devin McLaughlin again pushed their squad out to an early lead. Feeding off the cheers of the crowd, McLaughlin fought through an early letdown to construct a four-set win. Hughes, on the other hand, cruised to victory. The rookie made himself known in the second set, as his superior frontcourt game aided him in craftily dictating play and rendering his opponent helpless.
Completing the first wave of matches, junior Madhav Dhingra fell in a contested four-game match against 26-year-old Bantam sophomore Thoboki Mohohlo. A former professional player from South Africa, Moholo and his aggressive style eventually wore down Dhingra.
In the next three matches on court, Harvard failed to claim a single victory. Afterwards, Abouaish, Brownell, and Koh set the ultimate score in the final wave of matches.
Senior Dylan Murray, and junior David Ryan, fought side by side in grueling back and forth matches. With each successive point, the tension mounted. Ultimately, both players fell in identical fashion, 3-1, albeit through vastly different styles of play. Junior Bradley Smith lost more routinely to Trinity junior Rick Penders, 11-7, 11-7, 11-3.
In spite of the loss, the Crimson secured its best result in the season since its undefeated 2013-2014 campaign.
“Obviously not the result that we wanted yesterday, but I'm extremely proud of the team and the way they've carried themselves all year,” Koh said. “The seniors have made an incredible impact on this team and we know the younger guys will use this weekend as motivation to come back stronger next year.”
HARVARD 5, COLUMBIA 4
In its semifinal match against Harvard, the Lions proved to be a tougher test than they had been earlier in the season. As is emphasized by the performance of their best player, junior Osama Khalifa, Columbia played with more grit on the national stage.
Dhingra, Brownell, Hughes and McLaughlin continued to extend their solid regular season play into the tournament. Each player triumphed decisively over his opponent. Replacing Murray in the lineup, sophomore Alexi Gosset claimed a crucial victory 8-11, 11-9, 2-11, 11-5, 11-4 at the ninth position, helping propel the Crimson into the finals.
Later on, Abouaish, Koh, and Ryan all lost in contested five-game matches at the first, seventh, and fourth positions, respectively. Abouaish and Ryan set out to early leads, only to see them slip away, while Koh nearly pulled off an upset after losing the first two games of his match. At position one, Khalifa refused to fold like he had in his last matchup with Abouaish, as he emphatically disarmed the rookie in the fifth game, 11-0.
HARVARD 8, YALE 1
After last Sunday’s closer than expected 5-4 bout, the seventh seeded Bulldogs came in with a realistic hope of upending Harvard. But with Ryan back in the line-up at the fifth position this time around, the Crimson cruised to an easy victory in the quarterfinal matchup.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sophomore Sonia Wang came into the 2017 Ivy League Women’s Swimming and Diving Championship meet after being out all season due to a stress fracture in her back. Despite her year-long absence, however, the Upland, Calif. native successfully defended her first-place crown in the 400-yard individual medley with a pool record-breaking time, shocking spectators and teammates alike.
In addition, Wang took third in both the 200 butterfly and the 200 individual medley, touching the wall in 1:58.02 and 1:59.65 respectively, earning NCAA B-cut times with both performances. But Wang wasn’t the only person dominating the pool during the four-day competition hosted by Brown in Providence, RI.
Wang’s performance was part of a team effort in which the Harvard women’s swimming and diving team finished second overall in the Ancient Eight title-deciding meet.
“As a team, we rose up to the challenge and everyone put forth their best swim,” senior co-captain Daniela Johnson Restrepo said.
The Crimson tallied 1,590.5 points, just under 100 points behind eventual Ivy champions Yale, whose 1,681 points won the Frank Keefe Trophy. Penn and Princeton finished a distant third and fourth, with 916 and 897 points, respectively.
Adding to Harvard’s individual achievements, sophomore Brittany Usinger won both the 100 and 200 butterfly, with times of 52.92 and 1:57.28, respectively. Usinger’s winning performances also earned NCAA B-cut times. In addition to her podium-topping competitions, the Lafayette, Calif. native also took sixth in the 100 backstroke and participated in the bronze-medal 200 medley relay.
Despite their loss to Yale, the group of Crimson women ended the weekend having broken several records and garnered several individual medals. The group’s leaders attributed the team’s successes to its aura of positivity.
“The energy and camaraderie that we had as a team created an exciting and motivating atmosphere,” Wang said. “I am so proud to be a part of the Harvard women’s swimming and diving team. They inspire me everyday to be a better swimmer, teammate, and friend.”
In addition, on Wednesday night freshman Miki Dahlke, set the Harvard record for the fastest 200 freestyle time during her leg of the 800 freestyle relay. The same relay went on to make its own mark on the Crimson history books, breaking the previous Harvard record time of 7:08.37.
Dahlke also captured bronze in the 100 free, right ahead of teammate junior Gabby Sims. In addition, the freshman came up with an unusual score in the 50 free, locked in a dead heat with Columbia sophomore Mary Ashby—both touched the wall in 22.80, so they split fourth place.
Sophomore Meagan Popp defended her title record in the 200 individual medley with a time of 1:58.45. In addition to her individual success, Popp also earned second in the 400 medley relay, alongside teammates freshmen Mei Lynn Colby, Dahlke, and freshman Jerrica Li. The same relay team also posted the fourth-best time in program history.
Despite her rookie status, Colby placed third in the 50 free, earning the spot of top Crimson finisher, and solidifying her place in the record books with the second fastest Harvard time ever.
On the boards, sophomore Mikaela Thompson dominated as well, defending her title in the one-meter dive by a 5-point margin. Junior Jing Leung took the top Crimson spot in the three-meter, though her second place score missed the gold by a mere three points.
The distance contingent, led by senior Willa Wang, also saw success. The senior solidified a place on the podium in the 1650 free, coming in third, as well as slating the same spot in the 1000 free. She was followed by junior Regan Kology, who took fifth in both the 1650 and 1000 free races.
“We gave it our best the whole way through,” senior co-captain Summer Schmitt said. “We did this for each other and not for ourselves. We gave everything we had for our team.”
Yale’s victory was its first Ivy League women’s swimming and diving title since 1997 and its seventh all-time. This year also marks the first time that Harvard and Princeton haven’t won since 1999, as the Crimson and Tigers have combined to claim the past 17 Ivy League women’s swimming and diving championships.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
EDITORS' NOTE: Due to errors during the editing and publication process, this internal satirical article was posted to the Back Page blog. In the interests of transparency and due to The Crimson's longstanding policy against removing content from our website, this article will remain viewable to readers.
The crowd of two spectators hushed when Chad Borgman released the most important shot of his career.
All afternoon, the freshman power forward had tormented his Crimson Sports Board opponents. Borgman—listed at 6’8” and 277 pounds—had combined with third-year senior Mark Bode—listed at 6’7” and 235 pounds—to outrebound the Sports Board.
“If I can try to experience the life of a lobster, I’d say ‘Why not?’” Borgman said. “I’m all about exploring my options.”
Together the teammates had led the Harvard Political Review to a win in the first act of the best-of-three series. Together they had faced a 13-0 deficit in the second game only to rip off 14 straight points. Together they had battled to a 19-all deadlock.
Now, for the last time that afternoon, the players stood on the same hardwood floor, watching Borgman’s shot. The ball rose, spun, and sailed through the afternoon sunlight. Then it dropped—into the net and the nightmares of Sports writers.
Final score: HPR 21, Sports Board 19.
“We’re just a bunch of blue-collar guys,” Borgman said. “We let it in set in for a while, but we got back to 5 p.m. basketball practice every Sunday like we normally do.”
Borgman was not the only standout on a day when the upstart HPR shocked the Sports Board, two spectators, and any MAC attendants. Bode shot lights-out from behind the arc, an ability that he attributed to his Indiana roots, among other factors.
“I stayed away from a lot of steroids,” the veteran said. “It was more about sinewy muscle. But it’s been a steady stream of HGH and amphetamines.”
Meanwhile, HPR President Ali Hakim provided leadership, strategy, and all-purpose hustle. He also nailed key three-pointers in consecutive games.
Both shots came with the Sports Board holding 19-14 leads. The second heave slammed off the glass and then the front rim, proving that the bank is open on Sundays.
“I was born in a small cottage 50 miles outside of Detroit,” Hakim said. “There’s no record of my birth…. I was born 25 pounds, three ounces. They said I’d never be able to walk because 80 percent of the weight was concentrated in my head. They said I’d never be able to balance, and I was walking within three days after my birth. I’ve been proving haters wrong from a young age, and I’ll continue to do so. Their words are not my concern.”
The result seemed to rattle the Sports Board, which squandered late leads in both contests. Freshman Cade Palmer led his team all afternoon, nailing midrange jumpers and stonewalling defenders with picks. But not even that effort could save the Sports Board.
“I did not [call my mother] for fear that I might break down crying,” junior Troy Boccelli said. “I’ve kept it to myself. It was definitely embarrassing, but I’m looking forward to getting back onto the court.”
The first game foreshadowed the second. Relying on jumpers from Palmer and post moves from Boccelli, the Sports Board built a 19-14 lead. The hometown favorites had a chance to ice the win, but a shot by three-point specialist Jake Meagher (senior) clanged off the rim.
That’s when the HPR went to work. Hakim’s jumper started the bleeding, and a flurry of short field goals ended the game.
“Being locked in a room with ‘Call Me Maybe’ for five years would make you into a prisoner of your own mind,” Bode said. “I feel like being unable to distinguish muffins from babies would be a conversation starter. You’d try to pick up babies from strollers, and people would be very confused.”
Both sides sported slim lineups, with role players shouldering serious duties. Sophomores Akash Wasil, Jacob Link, and Sal DeFrancesco all contributed plays for the HPR.
Meanwhile, Sports Board sophomore Jack Stockless combined with freshman tutee Henry Zhu to log meaningful minutes. Senior Caleb Lee emerged from retirement to provide a second-half spark, and junior Steve Gleason displayed great hustle and fundamentals.
Absent from competition was sophomore point guard Tommy McCarthy.
“Tommy ‘Let’s Bomb the S*** of the Russians’ McCarthy—he’s an absolute baller,” Boccelli said. “If you ever watch him in warmups, the man has hops. Frankly, he had a phenomenal rookie season, and I’d love to see it continue.”
At least for Hakim, the final score set off a period of joy, with the HPR exchanging high-fives. However, some of that positivity has proven temporary.
“If we were focusing on the real issues, like ‘Was Julius Caesar really a woman?’ I think we would’ve made a lot more progress in this world,” Hakim said. “I’m not convinced either way. All I’m saying is, ‘Julius’—I’ve never heard that name. Julia sounds more realistic.”
The Sports Board will have a chance to rebound with exhibition games at the MAC, tentatively scheduled for whenever people have free time.
Even so, the emotional hurt of the HPR defeat seems likely to linger. Put simply, some defeats are haunting.
“We managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory on Sunday,” Boccelli said. “It was a great game. Basketball is a game of runs. Their run was just a little bit more than ours. But there’s life beyond basketball. I’d like to think that once the ball stops bouncing, things are going to be all right. We’ll move on. But yeah, the Warriors blew a 3-1 lead.”

Sections
Although exam dates are clearly marked on course syllabi (does anyone but the section kid even read those?), their impending approach still surprises Harvard students as much as the New Haven Community College's recent football win.
Do you have trouble accepting the midterms’ existence? Did your attention span disappear because you scrolled through too many Flyby articles? Do you break out in cold sweat every time your TF emails you with yet another reminder about an upcoming review session? Don’t worry—the next few weeks don't have to be blemished by a cycle of stress if you're smart about tackling the season. Flyby has compiled our best midterm survival tips for acing (or at least passing) your exams and keeping your sanity in the process.
Switch up your study spots
Please leave that armchair you’ve been glued to for the past 2 days—Lamont Cafe is not going anywhere. Studying in the same spot not only makes you feel a bit more dead inside but also decreases your information retention. So get up, bring your work with you and finally conquer Widener’s many steps or trek across the river to Harvard Business School. You might even catch a celebrity or two if you head over there. If you are feeling particularly brave, maybe even venture outside the Harvard bubble.
Try to be healthy
As boring and condescending this may sound, try to sleep sometimes, eat a vegetable or two, and drink water instead of shots (though really, if you’re drinking before your exams you may want to reevaluate your life choices). It’s as simple as this: you cannot ace your exams on vending machine fare and library futon naps alone.
Take unconventional study breaks
Instead of binging the Office for the billionth time, maybe do something actually fun for a change. Take a long walk through the Commons, visit CAMHS therapy dogs, or channel your Bob Ross with the coloring book your Secret Santa got you from Urban Outfitters. Trust us: you'll feel refreshed and ready for another 1.5x speed lecture video in no time.
Remember personal hygiene
Please shower. Seriously. If you are feeling lazy (and don’t care about your social life) at least spritz on some dry shampoo to look presentable for your section crush.
Get the help you need
You don’t have to fight this battle alone—tap into Harvard’s numerous resources, like office hours or the Bureau of Study Counsel to survive the academic onslaught. You can also form a study group or ask the aforementioned section kid to explain the material to you. Just don’t forget about the Honor Code if you want to still suffer through midterms next semester.
Laminate your notes to ward off tears and food stains and remember this: if Britney could make it through 2007, you can survive midterm season.
