Eliza M. McLamb has one foot in the real world and one in the spiritual.
A successful singer-songwriter and podcaster, McLamb has taken advantage of the last few years as a time to focus on fostering community with her musical gift. In an interview with The Harvard Crimson, McLamb discussed what music means to herself and her world.
“My music typically resonates with young, sensitive people who have a lot of emotions and think very deeply about their feelings,” said McLamb. “People who traverse through this space between the physical reality and the spiritual, emotional reality.”
This blend of reality and spirituality manifests in her more contemplative songs like “Salt Circle,” the titular track of her most recent EP. Despite creating such pensive music, though, McLamb rejects the label of stereotypical “sad girl music” for her work
“Something that I've noticed when talking with other women who make confessional, deeply-feeling art is that it’s actually hopeful to put all of your emotional rawness out into the ether,” McLamb said, noting the connection-seeking nature of sharing music with the world. “Even if you have the saddest song in the world, if other people are connecting to that, that's fundamentally optimistic.”
McLamb commented that female alternative artists are often the ones that tend to get grouped together in such a reductive manner. “It frustrates me when people call my music ‘sad girl music’ — it’s hopeful girl music. It’s community-building girl music. It's so much more.”
Music-making is nothing new to McLamb, as she’s written songs for as long as she can remember, but her career only started taking off in the last few years.
“I was thinking I was going to go to law school, but then the pandemic hit when I was in my sophomore year at GW,” said McLamb. “That kind of provided an opportunity for me to really question if this path was right for me.”
While her academic world paused, McLamb reflected on the past few years of her life and translated them into art. She began posting songs on TikTok, using commenters’ suggestions as inspiration for new pieces in a feedback loop of collaborative creativity. Ultimately, she wound up living in Los Angeles with a friend, where she has remained for the past two years, developing her music career.
Although she expressed gratitude for the community that initially gave her music exposure on TikTok — “they’re the ones that made me realize I could actually do music as a thing,” she said — McLamb clarified that she no longer uses the platform.
“I think TikTok feeds off of our limited attention span. The artists that I see get success on TikTok have really catchy, hooky pop songs,” McLamb said, contrasting the platform with her goals as an artist. “My songs are kind of like puzzles, lyrically, and you can't fit a puzzle in five seconds. It's not meant to be solved that way.”
Beyond music, McLamb engages with intellectual and socioemotional worlds through her podcast “Binchtopia,” a “guide through our current cultural hellscape” which is co-hosted alongside her friend Julia Hava.
“Come have a laugh with us through the end times of late-stage capitalism!” reads Binchtopia’s bio, and Hava and McLamb do just that, episodically discussing topical themes by providing their own research-driven commentary and personal experiences.
“My favorite episodes are the ones where we connect history to the present moment,” said McLamb, citing an episode where the co-hosts uncovered the origins of the internet phenomenon of boy moms. “We looked into Freudian psychology, we looked into emotional enmeshment, all this academic stuff. And then we were able to create a whole arc of where all of this comes from.”
Much like with her music, in “Binchtopia,” McLamb successfully blends the emotional world she perceives with the tangible realities grounded by her academic background. The artist sees herself as a conduit between these facets of the human experience.
“I feel like if you have the ability to straddle two worlds, it's important to use it to translate from the other side,” she said, explaining why she creates the work that she does. “I'm literally just a conduit. I don't think anything I'm saying is coming from me directly; it's coming through me, but it's not me.”
This same spiritual lens shapes how McLamb views live performance as well.
“It's the most amazing thing when I write a song that I am convinced is just for me, that's so particular and so personal,” McLamb said. “And then I sing it on stage and I have a hundred people singing it back. To me, that's God. God is in the room.”
Although she was initially nervous to first perform live in early 2021, she quickly shed her concerns in favor of enjoying the unique nature of live performance.
“It was so fun to have the performance that I give of a certain song be the only one that exists,” she said, recalling how she first fell in love with performing live. “It's in this whole other space; there are some times where in the recorded version, I'm not able to belt part of a song. But onstage, I can do it easily.”
McLamb is uniquely gifted in recognizing and navigating different spaces with ease. She will be performing live in Cambridge on Mar. 6, at The Sinclair and anticipates releasing a forthcoming album later this year. Her personal musings are available through her Substack.

There are countless pieces of literature that touch on themes of death and the loss of a loved one. While other memoirs and nonfiction biographies provide personal insights into the experience of one that is terminally ill, Catherine Newman writes “We All Want Impossible Things” with a spotlight on the family member of a terminally ill character. This narrative choice leaves readers with a one-sided perspective that fails to reach beyond the superficial storyline of generic, overused themes of death and loss.
“We All Want Impossible Things” revolves around the lives of two female best friends. Ash is a middle-aged single mother and the narrator of the novel who cares for her best friend, Edi, a woman dying of ovarian cancer and currently living in a hospice care center. The plot line follows a rather linear, predictable timeline dotted with deeply personal moments: Ash sending Edi her favorite Sicilian lemon cake, Edi sharing her last moments with her son Dash, and Ash balancing her life with her daughter and multiple love interests while also spending most of her days at the hospice care center.
For a novel that covers topics as serious as hospice care and terminal cancer, Newman’s writing and Ash’s narration often feel too humorous and insensitive for the underlying story of loss, death, and grief. The overall writing style feels ingenuine and unrealistic for someone truly dealing with the loss of a loved one. Ash’s character often uses forced, almost offensive language when describing her best friend:
“[Edi is] dying (Dying!) to learn about new music,” or, “She wants me to wedge a pillow under her knees to see if that will take the pressure off her hips, which are killing her. (Killing her!)” While this may represent a realistic use of humor to cope with the reality of terminal illness, the dialogue feels overly trite and takes away from the more important themes of grief that this novel has the potential to cover.
In similar novels about the process of death and acceptance such as “Tuesdays with Morrie” by Mitch Albom or “When Breath Becomes Air” by Paul Kalanithi, the main narrative revolves around the last thoughts of the dying loved one, focusing on the philosophical process of accepting death and grieving the loss of life. Disappointingly, this novel seemed to focus more on Ash’s confusing love life and one-off conversations with her daughter that feel disconnected and rather unimportant compared to her relationship with her dying best friend, Edi.
Ash herself is a confusing, somewhat frustrating character and narrator. Ash finds herself sleeping with her dying best friend's brother, Jude, and also sleeping with Edi’s hospice care doctor, Dr. Soprano. This plot line feels extremely unbelievable with unnecessary details about Ash’s romantic relationships that distract from the very real, upsetting process of her best friend's illness.
Newman did offer a few novel ideas and themes about the personal toll of taking care of a terminally ill friend. The sense of place throughout the novel mirrored a sitcom set — the characters seem to monotonously bounce between the same locations, creating a different experience only with their new lines and clothing choices. In the novel, Ash takes the reader repeatedly back and forth between the hospice center and her home, a predictable change of location that makes the novel seem, at first, extremely one-dimensional.
However, through closer inspection, Newman carefully brings the reader between two very predictable places to mimic the emotional toll and monotony of helping a loved one through the process of hospice care: Every day seems to be this unchanging routine of waking up, visiting the hospice center, and coming home for dinner — only to repeat this process day after day. By putting the reader in the narrator’s shoes, Newman reveals how the underwhelming physical transition of daily life pairs with the overwhelming emotional changes that happen every day. While the location of the narrator may seem predictable, her romantic relationships, conversations with her daughter and ex-husband, and of course her time with her terminally ill best friend, create changes and unpredictability in her life every day.
The novel also touches on the universality of death. Novels about loss often focus on the personal connection and the stories that each grieving person holds, without recognizing the cyclical nature of life that every person will eventually encounter. This novel, however, offers insightful quotes that recognize the humbling fact that everyone will experience grief. “Everywhere, behind closed doors, people are dying, and people are grieving them. It’s the most basic fact about human life — tied with birth, I guess — but it’s so startling too… A worldwide crescendo of grief, sustained day after day, and only one tiny note of it is mine,” the narrator writes.
Despite Ash’s unrealistic, romantic relationships with Edi’s hospice doctor and brother, the feeling of being unprepared to console one’s best friend through a difficult time in their life did feel quite realistic. Even in a best-friend relationship, Ash still struggles to find the right words or advice for Edi: “She’s looking into my face, nodding, even though I am fully winging it now, panicking, words pouring out like I’m a hose on the weepy consolation setting.”
Despite a few unique themes and quotes about loss, overall “We All Want Impossible Things” touches on predictable themes of death through a confusing, frustrating account of the narrator’s personal life, the details of which often seem to distract from her relationship with her dying best friend. This novel may make readers question if fiction is the proper medium to explore personal loss, or if stories about death and grief should remain in the memoir or nonfiction space that depicts a much more realistic image of life with a terminal illness and the loss of a loved one.

A sleepy vineyard in the lush Australian wine country; a mysterious disappearance; a tight-knit community with more than a few secrets ready to come to light. “Exiles” by Jane Harper lays out an enticing scene for a mystery novel, set in the fictional Maralee Valley of the author’s native Australia. The story begins with a sleeping baby found alone in a pram at the village’s annual festival. The child’s mother, Kim Gillipsie, vanishes into the night. The novel’s protagonist, federal investigator Aaron Falk, returns to the valley a year later to uncover the mystery, but as he learns more about the community that Kim was a part of, he discovers a web of family ties and generational secrets. “Exiles” is a trilogy finale following Harper’s highly acclaimed first and second novels “Dry” and “Force of Nature,” but readers can jump into this novel with ease — it effectively serves as a standalone narrative, with occasional allusions to the events of past books.
“Exiles” takes time to lay out its large cast of characters, notable among them the protagonist Falk, a shrewd and reserved policeman and an outsider welcomed into their close-knit community; Kim Gillespie, the missing woman who was once an entrenched member in the Maralee community but had since grown distant; and Gemma Tozer, festival organizer and Falk’s love interest.
Most of the characters are not particularly memorable or interesting, perhaps because of the sheer number of people Harper introduces; the only characters who feel compelling are the narrator Falk himself and the missing woman Kim, whose psychological and emotional states are developed and dissected throughout the novel. Her absence is tantalizing, and the various clues and dead ends dropped throughout the novel raise question after question, leaving expectations high for the mystery to be revealed.
While mystery abounds in this sleepy village, most of the plot leaves the reader with more questions than answers, and the novel’s slow pace and vague conclusion yield a sense of faint dissatisfaction. The story centers around the mystery of Kim Gillespie’s disappearance, but the suspense drags on unnecessarily at times rather than propelling the story forward. While the pace picks up around the middle, the final twist is revealed so late into the story that it feels anticlimactic, especially since there is little to no significant foreshadowing of the eventual reveal.
In addition, the twist is partially revealed through chapters told from the perspective of Kim and her husband, who was involved in her disappearance, which sheds light on the story but also feels lazy on the author’s part. A mystery novel satisfies readers when the resolution is unexpected but could have been predicted with the clues given. The twist in “Exiles” comes after a string of disconnected and random clues that do not quite make sense once the final reveal is known.
The setting of the novel is one of the only places where “Exiles” really shines. The deep bushland, lush vineyard, and reservoir lake serve as significant locations in the plot, and the writing excels at immersing the reader in the surroundings of Maralee Valley and elevating the novel above the rest of its mediocre elements.
The novel’s subplot is frankly more compelling than the mystery of the main plot. Falk has a romantic interlude with the festival organizer Gemma Tozer, while simultaneously solving the mystery of her late husband’s death six years prior. This narrative is more compelling than the mystery of Kim’s disappearance since its resolution actually makes sense. The love plot is utterly predictable but altogether sweet, especially the scenes where Falk bonded with Gemma’s son and helped him through his grief.
The writing, while often corny, does its job to move the story forward. The book is relatively painless to get through, especially once the pacing picks up in the middle of the novel. “Exiles” is a fairly light read, skimming the surface of anything too dark and unpleasant for readers’ tastes, but in the end provides a simple but genuine lesson on the importance of keeping community ties alive. The most compelling characters — Falk and the missing woman Kim – are “exiles” in their own ways, underscoring the importance of having a strong network of friends and family. While the resolution of the mystery was disappointing, the ending for Falk’s character provides what surely is a satisfying conclusion for fans of the Falk trilogy, although leaving the story open for another sequel.
Overall, “Exiles” is an underwhelming mystery novel with a disappointing twist and a conclusion that is barely satisfactory. The novel is sufficiently interesting if the reader has nothing else to do, perhaps on a long flight or train ride, but not nearly good enough to truly entertain.

TLC’s latest show — “MILF Manor” — proves that reality television has finally gone too far. Like many networks targeting older generations in dating shows, the show starts off simple enough: Eight attractive older ladies travel to a villa in Mexico for their very own “Love Island” experience, except the men they are searching for are young enough to be their sons. In the first episode, the women take some time to get to know each other, eagerly anticipating meeting the men that will reveal themselves as their potential suitors. However, the show takes an unsettling turn when the men are revealed to be the women’s actual sons, looking for love with older women.
All of this may sound like the setup to the most awkward season of “Bachelor in Paradise” ever, but it only gets worse from there. Do the men and women sleep in two separate large rooms similar to other dating shows like “Single’s Inferno”? Nope, bedrooms are shared by mother and son, an arrangement that will inevitably lead to contestants kicking out their own mother or son in order to get the full scandalous experience. Are the overly-sexual challenges done by the closest couples? Nope, mother and son again. In fact, a game in the first episode requires the mothers to identify their sons by feeling up their shirtless bodies while blindfolded.
The women themselves range from typical soccer moms to nipped and tucked cougars — one of whom even goes by social media persona “Disco Mammi” — but all of them lead more promiscuous lives than perhaps their sons are aware. In the second episode, the mothers and sons are asked to write down their deepest, darkest secrets, which are then pinned to a wall in front of the entire villa. A date is awarded to all of the mother-son pairs that do not correctly guess the other's secret. Some of the secrets are sexual in nature, but the majority are benign, like hooking up with people and never calling them again, or doing the deed in some interesting public locations. But one stands out from the rest: One mother confessed to sleeping with her son's best friend. Once it is revealed which mother the secret belongs to, what ensues is a scene only meant for a therapist's office. By the following episode, it’s clear that her son has been legitimately traumatized by the information and viewers are left to question if this should have ever been put out for public consumption.
When watching this show, one has to wonder whether the inverse would have ever been allowed to air. Would there ever be a market for DILF Domicile — where older men are invited to date younger women who turn out to be their daughters? This inverse seems unlikely for two reasons. The first is that the primary market for TLC is older women, who probably are more comfortable watching other older women in a sexually taboo context. But the second, and far more impactful reason, is that it feels sexually exploitative — the incestuous undertone would be too “creepy,” and their fathers would be deemed too overprotective.
But how is “MILF Manor” any different? The show’s airing, as absurd as the premise is, exposes the double-standard in perspectives on age gaps in heterosexual relationships. There is, unquestionably, a power imbalance in the romantic relationships explored in “MILF Manor,” a dynamic that would be protested if it was explored in father-daughter relationships. Rest assured, “MILF Manor” is exactly as creepy as described, and should never be viewed within a one hundred mile radius of one's own parents.

When advertising the music video for her new single, “Body Better,” Maisie Peters promised on an Instagram post: “im politely and properly warning u now it is my best ever.” Following the success of her debut album “You Signed Up For This,”this claim was certainly a lot to live up to. What resulted is a 2000s-inspired music video of a graveyard picnic festooned with pastel colors. While “Body Better”’s music video is not quite subversive, it is a worthy and enjoyable accompaniment to an upbeat tune that belies its emotional lyrics.
Tonally, “Body Better” is a departure from Peters’s first album, which featured softer pop sounds, and shared more similarities to the singles that she released in 2022. “Body Better,” with its catchy upbeat tune, finds its lineage in the pop-punk feel of “Not Another Rockstar” and the song’s teenage angst is mirrored in “Blonde.”
Admittedly, “Body Better” lacks the lyricism present in some of Peters’s finest work, like the double entendres in “Psycho” or the playful storytelling in “I’m Trying (Not Friends).” The strong beat accompanying the song gives it the feeling of a pop punk tune, a symptom of the current resurgence in 2000s pop punk music reminiscent of Olivia Rodrigo’s “good 4 u” or Avril Lavigne’s “Love Sux.” Yet the single is undeniably catchy, and the buoyant rhythm presents a jarring juxtaposition to the vulnerability concealed beneath the defiant lyrics that Peters has penned.
Though the song would not sound out of place on Spotify’s “Happy Hits!” playlist, the lyrics of “Body Better” are achingly honest. Peters sings about watching her ex get together with another girl and the insecurities that this unfurls , asking, “Now I’m watching you moving on in the beat of drum / If I never gave you any reason to run / Then I can’t help thinking that she's got a better body / Has she got a body better than mine?” These are perhaps not the most earth-shattering lyrics, but Peters is unguarded about her own self-doubt, creating a surprisingly sweet and tender song that echoes the honest vulnerability which made her first album so compelling.
For anyone hoping for a creepy graveyard setting, prepare to be disappointed: The music video, directed by Mia Barnes, crackles with Y2K energy and a candy pastel theme. The closest Peters comes to blood is smearing red colored cake on her white dress.
Underneath the soothing color scheme, however, there is an undercurrent of unhinged behavior. Amidst this pastel paradise, the video features Peters having a picnic with an ensemble of other girls, who, as the chorus builds, partake gleefully in the destruction of crochet dolls, stabbing and tearing them apart.
“Loving you was easy / That’s why it hurts now / The worst way to love somebody’s to watch them love somebody else and it work out,” Peters sings as they robotically stab crochet dolls while staring emotionlessly into the camera. In another scene, Peters stares directly again into the camera and sings through clenched teeth, “You took what you took, and left what you left / and I don’t know how I still can’t make it make any sense.” Her desperation to find closure following heartbreak is palpable through the screen and painfully relatable to anyone who has shared her experience.
Director Mia Barnes provides the music video with a strong sense of its aesthetic direction. The entire video has a shimmery, ethereal filter around it, bringing to mind “Clueless” and “Legally Blonde” — in other words, evoking exactly the mood that it set out to achieve. In a particularly powerful scene that closes out the music video, Peters, dressed in white, looks at a still, doll-like version of herself standing in the cemetery (think the twins from “The Shining”), and in reaching out to embrace her, simultaneously consoles and accepts herself despite the insecurities she feels.
The visuals certainly parallel the song’s message. Much like how Peters has disguised her heartwrenching lyrics with a cheery pop tune, the cottagecore aesthetic lightens and romanticizes the otherwise eerie graveyard.
Ultimately, “Body Better” is the perfect anti-Valentine’s Day song for anyone who felt particularly single last Tuesday, and a strong opening to Peters’s sophomore album, “The Good Witch,” which is set to be released on June 16.

“Waiting for Godot” has undergone every possible directorial interpretation since its 1953 debut; absurdist masterpiece, religious playground, wartime resistance, existential fodder, and homoerotic comedy. Deadword Theater Company’s iteration, which opened Feb. 12 at The Rockwell, goes in a new, albeit unclear direction, borrowing from the best and worst of interpretations.
Housed in a tight space, the set design is minimal but adequate, enhanced greatly by Liam Grimaldi’s modern lighting design. “Waiting for Godot” plays out in a non-space made tangible only by a tree, somewhere for Estragon to sit, and the ever-present threat of night. The Company’s demand for minimalism creates a performance enriched by focus and not scarcity, and lets their lighting designer and actors control the atmosphere.
And Vladimir (Jack Aschenbach) does.
Aschenbach’s command of Vladimir’s neurotically existential tendencies is magnetic, balancing his more humorous moments with a restless mental anguish that jumps out without creating dissonance. Costume Designer Gaby Obando Arévalo aces her assignment with Vladimir, as the vagabond loses threads from his clothing as haphazardly as he loses his grip on reality. The performance is worth seeing just to watch Aschenbach untangle Vladimir’s rambling monologues with both conscious contemplation and enthusiasm.
While Aschenbach’s performance finds its stride as the two-act play progresses, the rest of the production falters. Deadword’s production leans far too heavily on slapstick humor in an attempt to balance out the morbidity and intensity of Beckett’s masterpiece. Estragon (Jack Yeatman) acts with the bravado and exaggeration of an improv show, a weak opposite to Aschenbach’s complex subtlety. It’s funny, for sure, but an over-reliance on audience chuckles means the more interesting purpose of Estragon’s inert futility and forgetfulness is lost on Yeatman. The repetition at the center of Beckett’s dialogue becomes laborious under Yeatman’s interpretation, and when Estragon declares “the more you eat the worse it gets,” I couldn’t agree more.
Deadword’s sound design is perhaps the most disappointing element. At times it helps cut exchanges soaked in vulgarity, but largely focuses on adding cartoonish sound effects to already slapstick sequences. It both cheapens some of the more powerful instances of resolute absurdity and becomes so distractingly overt the actors lose control over their own play-space. For nearly an entire act, a sound effect pings every time a character remarks they are “Waiting for Godot,” hitting the audience over the head with the same clumsiness of a sitcom. Combined with the caricature-like over-acting of many characters, moments of the show grow cumbersome quite quickly — and in a play where famously nothing happens, well-handled complexity needs to be the core of the show.
Beyond the tireless exchanges between Estragon and Vladimir, by far the best moment of Deadword’s production is Lucky’s (Liam Grimaldi) outburst of philosophical ramblings that leaves the entire stage trembling. Grimaldi is wonderfully creepy before acting “against the dialogue rather than with it,” in the words of dramatist Martin Esslin. Dramatic and erratic lighting design (designed by Grimaldi himself) strengthens Lucky’s absurdly unhinged response to his owner Pozzo’s command to “think” for Estragon and Vladimir, and Grimaldi never falters in his commitment to extremes. Speaking at the speed of light and reigniting the energy of a sleepy audience, Grimaldi brings back the cocktail of unflinching cruelty, morbid excitement, and cultural speculation the play desperately needs.
But the play also lacks moments of stillness. Beckett’s play has little embellishment but endless depth, and in a physical space that intimate, Deadword’s production could use those moments of pause and silence to greater effect. On the other hand, the fluidity of interpretation produces a few fantastic, hilarious, Biblical tableaux vivants. The stage sometimes descends unexpectedly into a flurry of motion, delightful in the face of existential dread. It is impossible to accuse Deadword’s production of being anything short of enthusiastic and energetic — sometimes to a fault — with an unrelenting sense of playfulness.
You can see Deadword Theater Company’s production of “Waiting for Godot” at the Rockwell on Feb. 26, Feb. 28, and March 1.

Fourteen years ago, the cinematic world was taken by storm with the release of the blockbuster sci-fi film “Avatar,” directed, written, and co-produced by James Cameron. Cameron’s facial motion capture technology and extensive use of CGI drew countless flocks to theaters. This past December, Cameron returned with his long-awaited sequel, "Avatar: The Way of Water."
The ‘Avatar’ media franchise introduces a new world in Pandora, the fictional exomoon inhabited by the Na’vi, a humanoid species characterized most immediately by their blue skin. As humans seek to colonize Pandora and extract its valuable resources, the Na’vi serve as its capable defenders. Although it may be easy to treat the Na’vi as a novel, alien species, fiction often draws upon reality. Therefore, it is imperative to question the inspiration behind the blue figures on the big screen and the nature in which they are being portrayed.
In the construction of the Na’vi species, there are undeniable influences from Black and Indigenous cultures. Both films show Na’vi characters depicted wearing dreadlocks and braids, hairstyles with historical connections to Black and African cultures. Their usage of bows and poison-tipped arrows hold origin in native North and South American cultures, as well as traditional Indigenous clothing and body paint. The tongue in which the Na’vi communicate has roots in several Polynesian, African, and Native American languages.
After facing severe backlash to claims of the originality of his work, Cameron acknowledged the cultural influences of “Avatar,” particularly of Indigenous peoples. He wrote in 2012 that the “European destruction of native peoples, using military force, in order to acquire their land and resources, is the obvious basis for the ‘Avatar’ story.”
The reality is that, despite the substantial pilfering of nonwhite cultures, the writers and majority of the franchise’s actors are white. The casting of predominantly white actors for characters based on people of color serves as an act of appropriation some have dubbed as “blueface.”
In addition, with his blending of various Indigenous cultures and customs to represent the Na’vi, Cameron has been scrutinized for generalizing and equating many native cultures. As Dr. Autumn Asher BlackDeer — an assistant professor in the Graduate School of Social Work at the University of Denver, from the Southern Cheyenne Nation — mentioned in an interview with the Washington Post, the “Avatar” movies simply fall into the pattern of media portraying Indigenous peoples as a monolith.
Moreover, Cameron’s “Avatar” has been criticized for perpetuating the concept of the noble savage. The depiction of the Na’vi reproduces the trope wherein nonwhite cultures are romanticized for their characterization of being primitive and uncorrupted by civilization, entrenching them in a position still inherently inferior.
In his personal life, Cameron attempts to maintain a socially and environmentally conscious image. He is an avid environmentalist, practicing a vegan diet, and has filmed several documentaries highlighting the beauty of nature. Cameron’s alleged love for the environment shines through in both “Avatar” films, as Cameron portrays the Na’vi interacting with their natural environment and villainizes practices like mining and poaching. Still, Cameron can’t — and shouldn’t — encompass and speak for the relationship between Indigenous peoples and their lands.
The story of “Avatar” centers around protagonist Jake Sully, a marine sent by the Resources Development Administration (RDA) to gather information on the Na’vi. Sully infiltrates the Na’vi using the physical form of a Na'vi-human hybrid called an “avatar,” but instead of completing his mission, finds himself falling in love with a female Na’vi named Neytiri. Sully then proceeds to lead the Na’vi clan in battle against the RDA and take on his avatar form permanently. Aside from the visually spectacular nature of it all, at its core, the story is one of a white ex-marine assimilating fully into an Indigenous culture.
From dressing up as Native Americans for Halloween, to using Indigenous names and symbols as sports team mascots, cultural appropriation is a rampant, and often unaddressed, part of American society today. As “Avatar” features a white man assuming the body of another culture as his own — one that is inspired by actual communities of color — it trivializes the significance of cultural identity and treats it as transient. Entire cultures become as easy to slip on and off as a costume.
Beyond the implications of Sully’s assimilation, there is the matter of his ascension to a leadership position over the Na’vi. With the storyline reflecting the European colonization of Indigenous people, it seems almost like a revision of history, one in which white settlers get to be the “good guys” too. Sully’s ability to lead the indigenous population to success is a case of white saviorism, not to mention an erasure of the brutal and severe realities of colonization.
Both “Avatar” films have had production budgets of at least $250 million each, not to mention the millions spent in marketing — a privilege not many filmmakers of color ever see. Through using the histories of Indigenous peoples, Cameron has made billions — and more sequels are set to come.
With the release of “Avatar: The Way of Water,” numerous Indigenous groups have called for a boycott of the film, including Yuè Begay, a Navajo activist and co-chair of Indigenous Pride LA, who wrote in an open letter to Cameron from her Twitter account, “Hire our experts in your writing rooms, as your consultants, as your talent, as your leaders. Stop trying to lead. You are NOT our leader.”
Instead of encouraging viewers to watch “Avatar,” indigenous activist Dr. BlackDeer has compiled a list on Twitter of sci-fi films by Indigenous creators. In an interview with Dazed, Dr. BlackDeer said: “Indigenous people know what’s best for our communities, we can tell our own stories.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I have always loved photography’s ethereal quality. I cherish the medium’s ability to turn reality into fiction and create a world of imagination from concretely real things. Several years ago, my parents gifted me a copy of National Geographic’s “Asia and Oceania: Around the World in 125 years.” My history-loving, faraway imagination was seduced by the book, transporting me to the mountains of Kashmir, ports of Victoria Harbor, and jungles of Bagan to live a multitude of lives I had never before conceived of.
Of the photographers represented in the compilation, one of the most notable is the American photographer Steve McCurry, who is most well known for his portrait “Afghan Girl,” a dazzling work which takes as its subject a green-eyed young Afghan refugee in the early 1980s. Despite its stunning composition, the photo has become highly controversial in recent years after some of McCurry’s coercive tactics, which he employed to make his subject Sharbat Gula pose for the photo, surfaced.
The public’s concern with the photo in recent times reflects a broader objection to photographic practices that can be interpreted as exploitative, such as projects which do not aim to accurately reflect a given reality but instead capitalize on its attraction to a foreign audience. McCurry’s larger body of work, which in some cases reflects this tendency, is nevertheless defining of a genre of photography that meaningfully contributes to the global photographic ecosystem. The work he did in Afghanistan is a clear example of why.
Beginning in 1979 with the Soviet invasion of the country, a brutal, 10-year-long war fought between the US-backed Mujahideen and Soviet forces wreaked havoc on the country, killing anywhere between 500,000 and two million Afghan people. Still, McCurry’s work at the time, which included trips to 30 different refugee camps on the border of Afghanistan and Pakistan, evokes for some a sense of wonder about this beautiful region and its people. To this day, the large, heavy book of wonders in which I first found his work lives on my dorm room desk.
McCurry’s work is defined by both beauty and simplicity. In many ways, it ignites ideas of hope and intrigue about the harshest places in the world, which is a valuable and necessary way of constructing empathy for the breadth of the world’s inhabitants. Moreover, it attempts to accomplish this in an apolitical way by foregrounding essential aspects of the human experience such as beauty, love, and family, as opposed to the political conditions that experience exists within. In Maimana, Afghanistan, one of his photos shows a man and his three children riding aback a donkey, smiling as their pastel-colored clothes blend in with the blue-gray sky and green field. We will likely never know where they went and why they were so apparently happy at the moment McCurry’s shutter clicked, and that is the point. All the viewer can do is lose themself in the possibilities of what lay beyond the frame, what joys found homes in their faces.
Last year, my Dad pulled me aside and said, “This will blow your mind.” In his arms was a copy of Susan Meiselas’s “Nicaragua.” (Meiselas, like McCurry, is associated with the prestigious photography collective Magnum Photos.) Opening the book for the first time, it was difficult to comprehend the vividness of what I was seeing. On every page were documentations — pure documentations — of some brutal moments in the Nicaraguan Revolution in 1979. Unlike McCurry’s inviting depictions of Afghanistan, Meiselas’s work in Nicaragua highlights instances of violence. She doesn’t attempt to glorify the time period; she portrays Nicaragua in 1979 to be what the world least wanted to see: a bloodbath.
The revolution saw the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN), a group of USSR-backed socialists, overthrow the Somoza regime, only to then fight a continued bloody battle against the US-supported Contras. This period of violence was ultimately responsible for 50,000 deaths, or two percent of the Nicaraguan population.
As I slowly flipped through the pages of Meiselas’s book, I saw armed guerillas in the streets, citizens tied up in dark rooms, and lifeless bodies of all ages in pools of blood. It was a much more difficult reality to lose myself in than McCurry’s beautiful depictions of central Asia, largely because I didn’t want to. Even more confusingly, however, was the realization that both Meiselas’s bravery in Nicaragua and McCurry’s optimism in Afghanistan, which both “documented” similar Cold War issues only a few years apart, did so in entirely different ways. As such, they provoked two diametrically opposed feelings of hope and the harshness of reality. While McCurry’s inviting style caused me to want to immerse myself in the beauty of a faraway place, Meiselas’s portrayal of a similar issue made me conscious of the brutalities of war. Both methods are necessary and have a place in photography.
Meiselas’s work leaves little room for speculation. Everything that the viewer is meant to understand is contained within the frame, a reality made possible by the gravity of her chosen subject. Throughout her project, Meiselas depicts people in a variety of environments and how they have been impacted by the revolution, leaving few stones unturned. As a result, there are very few uncertainties regarding what this time period in the Central American nation actually looked like to the American photojournalist. Moreover, Meiselas chronicles destruction extensively, while her fellow Magnum Photos colleague McCurry barely touches on the subject. As a result, rather than view Nicaragua with an extrapolatory eye, I see the nation exactly as Meiselas saw it: ravaged by war, brutal, and bombarded with strife. Who was responsible for this destruction and how the Nicaraguan Revolution may have occurred differently is a topic that Meiselas recalls avoiding defeatedly, primarily due to a humble, accepted, ignorance. “I wasn’t doing anything that gave a feeling for what in fact was going on there. Not going on in the world of events, but going on in terms of how people were feeling,” she writes.
This distinction is critical and one that all photographers should be aware of. At the end of the day, even documentary photography is an expression of the artist’s perception rather than an objective account of a moment in time.
For viewers of global events from afar, both artists and their respective documentary styles illuminate the realities of people trapped by the hands they have been dealt. In photographic form, as in McCurry’s work, pictures highlight to observers that humans far and wide are far more similar than their divergent experiences might imply, catalyzing senses of sympathy and appreciation. On the other hand, as Meiselas shows, it is equally crucial to understand the complexity and extent of hardships throughout the world without romanticizing the tragedies of others. In order for the photographic medium to evolve, photographers of the 21st century will need to reconcile this dichotomy in work that is both imaginative and grounded, hopefully igniting decades of further curiosity about the world’s most faraway places in minds old and young alike.
—Alexander J. Gerstenhaber’s column “F4: The World in Pictures” is an appreciation of the photography that tells untold stories about the joys, hardships, and realities of the world’s people.

A cistern is a kind of collection system, typically located on the roof to collect rainwater. But to Gabrielle Calvocoressi, a cistern is a vessel through which a poem collects and holds itself.
It was 7:00 p.m. on Wednesday, Feb. 15. In place of the typical shelves that crowd the room, Cambridge residents of all ages packed into the Grolier Poetry Book Shop as Isabel Galleymore and Gabrielle Calvocoressi — two Radcliffe Fellows working on full-length poetry collections — stood behind the microphone. The space resembled a kind of cistern, in which Galleymore and Calvocoressi explored themes of animalism, absence, grief, wonder, and tenderness.
Hailing all the way from Birmingham, England, Galleymore opened the night by sharing that this was her first reading in the United States. A poet interested in ecopoetics and the environmental humanities, she read from her poetry collection “Significant Other,” as well as some of her newer works.
Galleymore mentioned how a few years ago when she was writing the book, she met a marine biologist who opposed the idea of “being at one with nature.” He said that every time we have an opportunity to become one with nature, “perhaps we risk losing our responsibility to it.” Galleymore’s poetics, then, are an excavation into “how close / to come to nature without being eaten,” (a line from her poem, “Once”). Galleymore poses the question of how one can engage closely with the natural world without imposing our extractionist perspectives upon it.
“I’ve been trying to write a kind of romantic climate change poem,” Galleymore shares, prompting a smattering of chuckles among the Grolier crowd.
“It’s harder than I thought,” she explained — the merging of “rom-com tropes” with the “extremes of what we’re experiencing.”
Between poems, Galleymore said that she was “working on a project that’s thinking about the role cuteness plays in our relationships with the non-human world, how it suggests ways of commodifying nature but also caring for nature.” In particular, she described how even a stuffed, “monkey-esque” toy animal the speaker of her poem “Squeezamal™” sees on a car dashboard seemed commodified.
“It was so indiscriminate with its loving,” Galleymore writes. “I couldn’t help feeling angry, disappointed in myself.”
Galleymore proffers that one remedy to the commodification of nature is leaning into wonder and optimism. “People say I say ‘wow’ too much,” explained Galleymore, before sharing a closing poem that included a “wow” in each line, encapsulating her immense ardor and wonder for natural phenomena: the sea, the “shadows of each petal,” the sheer abundance of the world around us.
Galleymore then introduced Calvocoressi to the crowd. Calvocoressi’s poetry, said Galleymore, contains magic, “magic that somehow leads us beyond speculative and into the real.”
Galleymore shared that she first came across “She Ties my Bow Tie,” a love poem from Calvocoressi’s third poetry collection, “Rocket Fantastic,” and was “spellbound.” Galleymore read the opening “She Ties my Bow Tie”: “What you thought was the sound of the deer drinking / at the base of the ravine was not their soft tongues / entering the water but my Love tying my bow tie.”
Calvocoressi’s language and poetics indeed create an effervescent magic that is at once deeply human yet wholly romantic. Committed to honesty, Calvocoressi vulnerably presents her experiences, speaking tenderly on themes of gender, sexuality, grief, and anxiety.
Sharing from her poem, “The Sun Got All Over Everything,” Calvocoressi read “I had made a plan to cry all day and into the evening."
“I mark it in my book. I wrote, ‘grieve,’ Because we’re all so busy aren’t we? I needed to make an appointment with my anguish.”
Calvocoressi blends topics of human grief and interiority with the natural world as previously explored by Galleymore: “the sun was like a yolk cracked over it … it poured across the girls / I let it find the tightness in my back / somewhere, my mother was dying and someone was skinning a giraffe. / and I let it go. I just let it go.”
She explored how the body is a cistern too, carrying grief, trauma, and memory. She read from “My Perimenopausal Body Cistern Disappointing How Surprising,” which includes the lines, “this body I fought for. Timid / skin sack that grew into a kind of magnificence I’d / not expected. I tie my bow tie around my neck that’s not / quite the neck I want.” The bow tie, in this poem, negotiates femininity, the body, and its imperfections. Gentle and consistent, the accessory provides grounding to the changing, aging experience.
In this way, Calvocoressi sees the body as a cistern for not just grief, but love. Calvocoressi celebrates and encapsulates this love in her poem “She Ties my Bow Tie,” which she revealed was written about her partner Angeline: “This is the breeze my Love makes when she ties me up / and sends me out into the world.”
Love, to Calvocoressi, is embracing the roughness of the body. Her poetics conclude that to love is to decorate another deeply human body with something beautiful.
The reading ended with abundant applause. What a gift, indeed, to be sent out into the world like a parcel wrapped up in Calvocoressi’s “bow tie” after this reading, stepping out from the stillness of the Grolier Cistern into the movement of Galleymore’s “magical,” natural world — in all its abundance.

Harvard has had a long history of inviting famous or influential people as guest speakers, lecturers, and awardees during classes and events. From pop singer and philanthropist Rihanna and film writer and director Steven Spielberg, to physician-scientist and immunologist Dr. Anthony Fauci and former German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Harvard has invited experts from fields of arts, sciences, technology, politics, and more to speak with its students in recent years. Now, second-year students at Harvard Business School will soon receive a guest lecture from one of the most infamous con artists of this century: Anna Delvey.
In the past, the name “Anna Delvey” opened doors. As The New York Times reported, from 2013 to 2017, Delvey, whose real name is Anna Sorokin, scammed her way into some of the most elite circles of New York City, tricking both financial institutions and New York’s wealthiest into believing that she was a German heiress with a net worth of over €60 million. She conned her way through private vacation trips and into VIP dinner parties, and even nearly obtained a $22 million loan from Citizens Bank before getting caught and arrested.
Delvey’s downfall, however, did not deter her from having an active following in the media. Even during her 2018 scam trials, Vox commented on Delvey’s fashionable courtroom outfits, and the New York Times made note of other bizarre moments from her trial. Delvey even interviewed for NBC News in an ICE detention center after facing potential deportation to Germany when she overstayed her visa in the United States. Today, she maintains over a million followers on Instagram and has appeared in a number of interviews since being put on house arrest.
In May 2018, Jessica Pressler — American journalist and occasional guest speaker in Harvard’s “The Art of the Con” expository writing course — published an exposé in New York Times that detailed the highs and lows of Delvey’s scamming journey and cemented Delvey in the spotlight, inspiring a Netflix original drama miniseries “Inventing Anna.” In this short series, viewers had the chance to live through a portrayal of Delvey’s scams and witness her mysterious demeanor, chameleon character, and confident attitude for themselves.
A couple of months ago, Delvey was a guest speaker at Columbia University’s “Intro to Reporting,” an introductory journalism course, during which she addressed the importance of treating sources with respect. Since then, she has allegedly also been approached by Oxford University. Delvey’s upcoming appearance at Harvard follows another recent Harvard Business School guest lecture from media personality and businesswoman Kim Kardashian, and reflects an increasing interest in media personalities and controversial pop culture figures by both the general public and Harvard Business School.
Who will Harvard Business School be inviting as its next guest speaker? Will it continue the current trend of media personalities? Perhaps it’ll be socialite entrepreneur Kylie Jenner or beauty guru James Charles. Or if continuing the list of con artists — will it be Frank Abagnale Jr.? Jordan Belfort? Elizabeth Holmes? It looks like the public will just have to wait and see.

On Creating Demons
A chicken crows evening in a hideaway hen–
house, songs of remembering and choosing.
I left my vitality, once, in the arm
of your apartment, a crooked yellow elbow. Do you remember?
Do you remember the sun? How it used to shine lucid and lemon,
distorted rectangles over honeyed hardwood,
and your cooing that all would pass. Edelweiss
and a stinging certainty that feelings stick
to words and words stick to everything.
Under your elbow/hand on hip I read
of riddled tudor homes and pairs of animals
reclaimed on deserts. Matted fur stuck to my
knee pads, cross-lined stencils on skin. Honey sun
replaced by a domed overhead light where I recited
salmon migration patterns to you and you read
me the stories with the endings. I have come
to pick up my belongings. The salmon
sweep, bronzed and bluing along the river.
The river’s growing cold. Hurry time. You remain
where I left you yet you are in the apartment,
you are elbow and cell bar and where
are my belongings? Porcelain sticks
like powdered seashells stuck to the heels
of my palms. I want so badly to release my demons
to you. To watch them chase you in dinnertime light.
I want so badly to tell you the things I never chose to hear.

Fresh Eyes
The mirror has morphed into a liar,
again, she has curved her frame like the spines
of the girls who swerve in the short videos
or the ridged back of a feral dog. My belly
bloats in her image, puffed like the interior
of a day old croissant, and I have begun
to feel the merge of morphed frames
(and fronts). If the man near that fountain
in London can lay corduroy jackets over valuable
real estate and name me a racist for minding
my business then you can surely call me.
Pick up the phone and scroll to the first letter
of my last name and tell me what I want to hear.
I have trouble with the dosage of my own
medicine, you see, like thick bubblegum Pepto Bismol
it slides down and I can feel it all the way.
Some baddies on the internet post photos
of neon bikinis and their slim beige bodies behind
them. My mirror is whispering New Years resolutions,
green juice, grind in the tri state area until March and then
hit Miami. Whores. Subway tiles either align in a fifty-
fifty split ratio else they break into thirds and it all goes awry.
My lips have always been too thin to be kissable and
I am jogging along the sidewalk in January and the air
is hazy and warm and soupy and I could be in Florida.
If you just pressed on the first letter of my last name,
we could start the whole story, you know. If you just
did all the initial work I could catch up, carry my weight,
somehow—(fingers crossed and) pinky swear.
—Dylan R. Ragas ’26’s column, “Yard Sale Organs,” is a collection of poems that attempt to make sense of a past—real, imagined, but mostly somewhere in between.

Salman Rushdie’s novel “Victory City” may be one of the most anticipated books of 2023. Rushdie’s 15th novel and the first book published since a failed assassination attempt last August continues to test the waters of religious tradition, this time fictionalizing the history of the Indian Vijayanagara empire. “Victory City” is not only a testament to the author’s resilience in the face of life threatening criticism, but a perfectly executed epic of historical fiction and magical realism.
“Victory City'' follows the story of the birth, glory, and fall of the fictional South Indian empire of Bisnaga. The novel is framed as the common translation of a newly “found text” from the great blind-prophetess-queen, Pampa Kampana, which is discovered half a millennium after her and the empire’s simultaneous deaths. Throughout the text, the translator acts as narrator, interjecting to summarize Pampa Kampana’s digressions and explain what poetic elements can’t be translated into the English language. The narrator denies scholarly credentials and instead claims to be a “spinner of yarns” retelling the story for the “entertainment and possible edification” of all readers. This framework sets up a believable text filled with symbolism, Hindu and Islamic allusions, and a direct critique of social injustice today.
From beginning to end, this book gives a masterclass in foreshadowing and character development. The entirety of the plot is revealed in the first few pages. Pampa Kampana, the protagonist, is introduced as a blind-poet, miracle worker, and prophetess tasked with overseeing the entire life of the empire she is told to create. The city will die in fire in the same way it was born. There will be women warriors and leaders, freedom of sexual expression, liberties like no empire in the world has seen or would see for many more years to come.
Yet the narrative begins with Pampa Kampana as a nine-year-old girl watching her home village burn. This leaves the rest of the book the precarious task of recounting the lifetime of a multigenerational empire through one character’s eyes with the ending already revealed. “Victory City” rises to the occasion with an unashamed story with captivating characters that connect with each other through space and time throughout the novel.
The weight of the work comes in the thematic significance of its prose. One consistent theme is the multi-perspective experience and acceptance of migration. The city of Bisnaga is inspired by the historical city and empire of Vijayanagara, which translates to “victory city.” In the book, the city Pampa Kampana creates is called Vijayanagar too. When a Portuguese foreigner visits and is unable to pronounce the name, managing only to utter “Bisnaga,” Pampa Kampana decides that this is what the city will be called. Here Rushdie effectively imagines a civilization to which language is irrelevant, or at least a mutable concept that lacks national or spiritual significance.
It is during moments like this where we can look at Bisnaga and reflect on modern nationalist movements. Yet “Victory City” is not some utopian manifesto on the perfect city. The people of Bisnaga resist Pampa Kampana, think independently and become influenced by their greed and pride. “Victory City” confronts the real world and explores how even the best ideals, backed by supernatural forces, must ultimately reconcile with an imperfect humanity.
For Rushdie, “Victory City” is another bold confrontation of religion, history, and tradition in a beautifully story interwoven with a contemporary critique of our world. It is this kind of writing that has made Rushdie an enemy to Islamic groups, who label his work irreverent. While there are certainly instances of irreverence in “Victory City” — such as the founders of Bisnaga deciding arbitrarily whether or not they will teach the people to care about circumcision, deciding that neither of them care very much themselves — labeling the entire work as flippant would be a disservice to the scrupulous efforts to recognize Hindu deities and acknowledge their mystical power throughout the story.
As the narrator hopes for in the opening lines, the book is filled with opportunities for edification, revealing numerous outlets to research real world Hindu and Islamic traditions. The book is easily readable and exciting through and through, opening a novel world of new perspectives to popular audiences around the world. For this, “Victory City” will be remembered as one of Rushdie’s most masterful works.

Last September, when Rihanna announced her imminent performance in the Apple Music Super Bowl LVII Halftime Show with her signature tattooed hand grabbing a football, I knew I had to be there. Long established as an international pop star, Rihanna has spent the past seven years since the release of her last album “ANTI” pursuing various other endeavors, proving that her music is only the tip of the iceberg.
Since the release of “ANTI” in 2017, Rihanna launched her makeup company Fenty Beauty, aimed at increasing inclusion and representation within the beauty industry, and the lingerie brand Savage x Fenty in 2018. The two brands’ success has made Rihanna a billionaire, with a net worth over $1.7 billion. Following her success, super fans worried that she would never hit the studio or the stage again. The last time the world witnessed Rihanna perform live was at the 2018 Grammy awards, where she performed “Wild Thoughts” with Bryson Tiller and DJ Khaled.
Still, it seemed she decided to grace the world with her stage presence once more.“It’s important for me to do this this year. It’s important for representation. It’s important for my son to see that,” Rihanna said in an NFL interview a few days before the show.
She looked as eye-catching as always, wearing a Loewe jumpsuit with a sculpted bustier, an Alaia coat with matching gloves, and MM6 Maison Margiela x Solomon sneakers.
But sitting in the audience, one question ran through my head the whole time — didn’t Rihanna say she was boycotting the NFL? In 2019, Rihanna turned down this very same performance in solidarity with Colin Kaepernick and her recent retraction feels damaging in certain respects. While halftime headliners are not paid for their performance, Rihanna’s decision to hit the stage felt like a desire for social capital at the expense of furthering a cause.
While the performance didn’t have any other celebrity appearances, it was not lacking a guest star, as she announced her second pregnancy with a baby bump reveal during the show. While Twitter was buzzing during the performance trying to guess if the reveal was intentional or not, it was clear in the stadium that she was announcing her pregnancy.
Over 118 million fans tuned in online to the Apple Music Halftime Show at the Glendale, Ariz. State Farm Stadium, the host of Super Bowl LVII. As the set was being assembled on the field, fans cheered in awe of the floating platforms where the Royal Family Dance crew performed nearly 60 feet off the ground.
With 12 of her greatest hits, ranging from “B*tch Better Have my Money” to “Rude Boy,” Rihanna’s beautiful vocals combined with showstopping choreography from Emmy award winner Parris Goebel made for an unforgettable performance. The contrast between her dancers’ all white costumes and her monochromatic red look drew the audience’s attention to the star. The choreography seemed inspired by Rihanna’s native country Barbados, featuring moves that were both sexually liberated and confident — key elements of her own persona — but Rihanna remained the focus.
Still, fans in the stadium were noticeably disappointed when “Run This Town” began to play and Jay-Z, who was seen at the game earlier, did not join the performance. Nonetheless, fans filled the stadium with flashlights for Rihanna’s “Diamonds” ballad atop the floating stage.
The only other challenge in regards to the performance was related to the jumbotrons, which cut out intermittently throughout the performance. When Rihanna took a break in the performance to use her very own Fenty Beauty Invisimatte blotting powder, it was not visible to the audience due to the technical challenge.
While much has changed since she first told Vogue she “just couldn’t be a sellout” in 2019, Rihanna has nonetheless proved that she is an unprecedented cultural force.

If you ask someone to name a queer film, chances are they will say “Brokeback Mountain.”
Released in 2005, this Neo-Western romantic drama begins in the 1960s in the mountains of Wyoming. Jake Gyllenhaal is Jack Twist and Heath Ledger is Ennis Del Mar, a couple of sheepherders whose work on Brokeback Mountain leads to a beautiful and heart-wrenching romance that develops between them — or so I was led to believe.
After hearing only fantastic things every time the movie came up in conversation, I finally decided to sit down and educate myself.
The endeavor began with high hopes. Immediately, the landscapes astound. The woods and mountains of America’s West convey a sense of serenity, as well as an air of promise. Jack and Ennis are alone on Brokeback Mountain save for the sheep under their care, spending their days trekking through the wilderness and eating cans of baked beans. The only sounds are the callings of hawks and the melancholy guitar strums of the soundtrack. It seems that the solitude of their setting will allow them to explore their identities free from the judgemental eyes of society.
But what unfolds is less of a romance and more of an amalgamation of lust and self-hatred that continues until the film’s close. Both men begin their shared journey virtually silent except for the occasional curt exchange of banalities, each seeming quite apprehensive of the other. Starting this way could have been an opportunity for the two characters to experience emotional development as they begin to trust and confide in each other. Instead, weeks on Brokeback Mountain seem to go by without any significant conversation between the two, let alone romantic tension.
Then, with little lead-up, Jack and Ennis have a drunken sexual encounter one night after they are forced to share a tent due to the biting cold. Even this experience is devoid of any semblance of romance; there is aggression, conflict, and confused passion, sure, but no affection. After the men consummate their relationship the first time, this still does not bring on any significant emotional or interpersonal growth. The two seem to pretend like it never happened, until one day, sitting out on the mountain, Ennis succinctly states: “You know I ain’t queer.” To which Jack responds, “Me neither.” Great talk.
To my dismay, Jack and Ennis finish their sheepherding assignment and part ways just 40 minutes into this over two hour film — I had been under the impression that the whole plot takes place on Brokeback Mountain. With this goes one of the film’s most redeeming qualities, which was its gorgeous, artistic scenery. But perhaps it’s still possible for Jack and Ennis to develop their relationship even though they’re no longer on the mountain herding sheep together?
I was a fool to hope. The rest of the movie is not even given the chance to develop romance, as Jack and Ennis simply do not share the screen. Ennis returns to his fiancée, Alma (Michelle Williams), in Wyoming, and the two get married and have two daughters. Jack is shown performing in rodeos in Texas, where he meets, marries, and has a child with Lureen Newsome (Anne Hathaway). Although Jack and Ennis are shown to reunite periodically over several years and take “fishing trips” together to Brokeback Mountain, the vast majority of runtime is spent focusing on the dynamics of each of their individual lives.
The rest of the film attempts to demonstrate the strained relationships the men have with their wives and children, presumably due to years of repressing their true queer identities and love for each other. Unfortunately, these relationships can be added to the long list of underdeveloped dynamics in “Brokeback Mountain.” Where there was potential, for instance, to expound upon the men’s roles as husbands and fathers, this was greatly stifled by a plethora of erratic and undelineated time jumps. It is understandable, of course, that trying to convey over 20 years worth of narrative is difficult. However, when the audience has trouble keeping track of whether one year, five years, or 15 years have passed between two consecutive scenes, this is probably a good indicator that the film’s timeline is unclear. The movie eventually ends when Ennis receives a postcard informing him that Jack is deceased, and he travels to Jack’s parents’ home to retrieve a portion of his ashes to scatter on Brokeback Mountain.
It is essential to the intention of “Brokeback Mountain” to convey the impacts of both societal and internalized homophobia on these gay men, and this is absolutely a valid and important goal. It is clear that the protagonists — and Ennis in particular — are meant to be struggling with severe internal conflicts about their queerness. One problem with the portrayal of this, however, is that the manifestation of their repression is exceptionally frustrating. The film conveys this internal conflict through the men’s intense aggression, anger, and tension; the two seem unable to communicate or process their feelings in a remotely healthy way. At one point, Ennis punches Jack in the nose during one of their shared bouts of aggression, a point that is never again addressed. Both men constantly ooze self-hatred and bucketloads of angst, which is not exactly a recipe for an enjoyable film. One thing is for certain, though, and this is that “Brokeback Mountain” truly wrote the book on homoerotic playfighting.
This leads to the next and more pressing problem, which is that there is exactly zero character development for either Jack or Ennis throughout the entire film. Jack continues in his same naïve outlook, in which he believes that he and Ennis should buy a ranch together and live happily ever after. On the opposite end of the spectrum, Ennis is a walking ball of tension and pessimism, continuing to deny his identity and appearing to continue to engage with Jack only against his best efforts at repression. I would like to specifically note that the problem is not inherent to each of Jack or Ennis’s individual flaws (flawed characters tend, in fact, to make good movies), but rather lies in the fact that neither grows or changes at all. Up until the very end of the film, their personas remain precisely the same, and it ultimately leads to both of their downfalls: Ennis divorced, purposeless, and Jack the victim of a (presumably) homophobically-motivated murder.
The overall result is a film about their romance except it seems that there is no enjoyment whatsoever being had in this relationship. The trouble with the film’s execution is that the men seem only to suffer from their gay identity and never experience a real sense of love or fulfillment. Even when they’re together, Jack and Ennis are mute, and their relationship is primarily physical and sexual, consisting primarily of roughhousing or fights. As a viewer, it is difficult to feel invested in this dynamic if you haven’t been given any glimpses into why the two are attracted to each other as people, what forms the foundation of this allegedly deep and passionate bond.
Still, the film was well-received by critics and the public alike. At the 78th Academy Awards in 2006, Brokeback Mountain was nominated for Best Picture and won for Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Original Score. Today, 88% of Google users report liking this movie, it has a 88% on Rotten Tomatoes, and — perhaps most impressively — it sports a 4.1 star rating on Letterboxd, a notoriously critical platform.
I can admit that the movie is relatively well-made (score, acting performances, cinematography, etc.) and that it boasts a star-studded cast including Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger, but also Anne Hathaway, Michelle Williams, Linda Cardellini, Anna Farris, David Harbour, and Kate Mara. It also cannot be disputed that the film does maintain a significant place in queer cinema. It consistently finds itself on lists of the best BGLTQ+ movies of all time, and can be lauded for centering the story of two gay men in 2005 when such topics were still heavily stigmatized.
However, the film has since been eclipsed by much better queer films that portray gay love in a more nuanced and thoughtful way. Looking back on “Brokeback Mountain” with the benefit of hindsight and today’s critical eye, it seems that the film was hurt by its preoccupation with portraying gay people in a palatable way for straight audiences.
This is most obvious in the film’s focus on queer pain. Yes, this was the reality of the time in which the story takes place, but the movie completely misses any opportunity it had to portray subversive queer joy, resistance, and transformative love. It is important to portray the trials of queer existence in a homophobic society in a way that is honest and uncensored, but focusing only on these struggles is not healthy, either.
Maybe I had unrealistic or misguided expectations for this movie. Maybe I just didn’t understand some profound message hidden within. Either way, I unfortunately found the film to be a frustrating and depressing creation that somehow uses its lengthy two-hour-plus run time to develop exactly nothing. If you enjoy films about queer misery, hopelessness, and a lack of agency in an inhospitable society, then “Brokeback Mountain” is the movie for you.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Against all odds, Woody and the gang are back for one last rodeo… again.
It’s not common for a story to definitively conclude on three separate occasions, but alas, that’s the reality Pixar is headed for with the recently-announced “Toy Story 5.” The next sequel in the animation studio’s flagship series was confirmed by Disney CEO Bob Iger during a Quarter 1 earnings call on Feb. 8, and the choice to return to the world of “Toy Story” is confusing to say the least.
When “Toy Story 3” was released in theaters in 2010, it was widely hailed as the perfect trilogy-capper; for a series that focuses on the lives toys lead and the emotions they exhibit when their owners aren’t around, there was some hefty bittersweetness to the idea of Andy — the toys’ owner in the films — growing up and heading off to college. Even though the third entry in the series delivers this tough blow, it still manages to match the comedic and narrative highs of the first two films, and ultimately serves as a satisfying send-off to the characters audiences had come to know and love since the original “Toy Story” was released 15 years prior. Just as Woody watches Andy drive away and utters the devastating line, “So long, partner,” it too seemed that Pixar was bidding a difficult goodbye to its most well-known series.
Then came “Toy Story 4.”
At the time of the film’s development, it seemed everyone had the same question: Why disturb something that already feels so complete? Well, thankfully, Pixar’s answer was as thoughtful as it could’ve been. The fourth film in the series confronts feelings of self-doubt and purposelessness in a post-Andy Woody, interestingly challenging the penchant for loyalty central to his character. So, while “Toy Story 4” is certainly no match for any of the first three, it provides what it feels is the true conclusion for the series’ main character, thus making a valid argument for why it deserves to exist.
Now, with the announcement of a fifth addition to the series, it simply feels like there’s nowhere left to go. Barring some sort of anthology story set during Andy’s childhood, it seems that “Toy Story 5” will be re-opening a can of worms on a narrative that has not only ended twice, but in a conclusive and satisfying fashion both times.
In terms of business, “Toy Story 5” unfortunately makes more sense than most other projects Disney could greenlight, and that seems to be why they’re opting to extend the series yet again. Long-time CEO Bob Iger, who recently returned to his post after Bob Chapek was ousted from the role, seems to be looking to restore faith in Disney’s storytelling, following a string of unfavorable business decisions that dominated Chapek’s time in office. During the aforementioned earnings call, Iger — who is known for Disney’s acquisitions of Pixar, Marvel Studios, and Lucasfilm — cited “Toy Story 5” and other announced sequels for “Frozen” and “Zootopia” as a “great example of how Disney is leaning into its unrivaled brands and franchises.” While Iger’s sentiment is undoubtedly spot-on, Disney doesn’t seem to have considered the full implications of revisiting “Toy Story” in particular.
One of the reasons the initial “Toy Story” trilogy works so well is that it offers a perfectly symmetrical narrative. In the original film, Woody grapples with the fact that he was replaced by Buzz Lightyear as the top toy in Andy’s room. He also helps the naive Buzz realize he is not a space ranger, but rather a toy meant to be played with and loved by Andy. “Toy Story 2” then cleverly turns this relationship on its head: When Woody is tantalized by the prospect of being shipped off to a museum with a set of dolls he was meant to be a part of, it is Buzz who reminds him of his commitment to Andy and what being a toy is really about. Finally, in “Toy Story 3,” Woody and Buzz realize their mission with Andy is complete, and that keeping the toys together is what’s most important. Overall, we have one film in which Woody is the catalyst for Buzz’s development, one in which it’s the other way around, and one in which they can both see how well this development served them throughout Andy’s childhood.
Then, “Toy Story 4” finds the only possible story thread worth coming back to: Woody’s emotional state in a world where Andy is gone and the toys’ new owner, Bonnie, doesn’t particularly care for him. The film chiefly crafts its analysis of Woody through interplay with a new character, Forky — a spork-turned-toy created by Bonnie. Forky does not understand what it means to be a toy, so Woody enters the ring as a veteran on the subject. This story is also paralleled by Woody’s re-acquaintance with Bo Peep, his old flame who now roams free and preaches the value of life without an owner.
The greatest strength of this film is Woody’s realization that his ultra-loyal tendencies can be a thing of the past now that Andy, his one true partner, has moved on. Woody’s ultimate decision to become a “lost toy” with Bo Peep, while slightly disappointing given his insistence on staying with Buzz and the other toys at the end of “Toy Story 3,” is an understandable product of his journey in this film alone, and gives him the happy ending he wouldn’t have otherwise had. Additionally, by using Woody and Forky’s relationship to harken back to the first two films’ key themes of purpose, loyalty, and friendship, “Toy Story 4” seems to intentionally function as a symbol of the series’ greatest lessons for a new generation, which lends credence to its supposed role as the permanent conclusion and only hurts the ceiling of a potential “Toy Story 5.”
Even with all thematic matters aside, there doesn’t seem to be any natural way to come back from how “Toy Story 4” ends. With Woody and Bo Peep on the road and Buzz and the other toys having remained with Bonnie, bringing the toys back together seems unfeasible, and doing so would effectively ruin what was certainly a tear-jerking goodbye between Woody and Buzz. Of course, this topic might not need to be broached if Pixar doesn’t plan on bringing these characters back for the next film, but any such decision would, frankly, be unthinkable for the series.
At the end of the day, despite the seeming indication that these movies had come to the end of the road, the fact is that Disney and Pixar have once again decided to reach for the sky, and they plucked “Toy Story 5” right out of it.
They probably should’ve left it there.

On the edge of Boston beside the Charles River, new music venue Roadrunner hosted Brighton Bazaar’s first ever Retromania expo on Feb. 18 and 19. With a large turnout, this event was a complete hit. A weekend-long experience, family and friends were transported back decades to explore vintage paraphernalia — fashion, comics, vinyls, jewelry, ephemera, and a variety of other collectibles.
Upon first walking into the venue, one may have felt overwhelmed by the sheer volume of vendors present; over 100 shops filled up the space. Over the speaker system, vinyl classics at least 50 years old and spanning all genres instantly filled visitors’ ears. The melodies of old-school musical pioneers like The Joe Cuba Sextet, Junior Walker, and The Gay Poppers quickly acclimated shoppers to the time period which many of these goods belong to.
Among the chaos, there were vibrant vendors waiting for customers to scour their booth. At the entrance there was a collection of vinyls, books, apparel, and accessories. Samantha Gottlich — the creator behind No Rhyme or Reason Art — greeted customers on their way to the first floor of the venue.
“I make all my goodies,” she said. “The earrings are made with a mix of vintage toys and cake toppers and trinkets. The tote bags are made with vintage bedding. Everything is old stuff made into new stuff that you can wear.”
Gottlich is not the only one changing the fashion industry with her upcycled work. Vendor Annie Gauger, owner of Annie Wear, has been making hats out of recycled material for nearly three decades.
“I always do it when I am out of money,” she says.
But her hats are not the only recycled materials at her booth.
“I got all of the skis from the dump from the town I am in,” Gauger says. “I found [my stand] on a street corner [...] and whacked it all together.”
Customers not searching for clothes or handmade accessories could also find trinkets to take home. For instance, Alley Tripp Art, a shop aptly named after the owner, sold tufted creations. During the event, Tripp was making a rug from scratch for people to admire.
If Brighton Bazaar’s Retromania proved anything, it’s that the community answers when thrifting calls. Everyone who arrived at the event was excited to be a part of it. With trinkets and clothing ranging $15 to more than $300, everyone who arrived was sure to find something that piqued their interests — or drained their wallets.
Members of the Bousey family coincidentally ran into each other by chance while shopping at the event.
“We didn’t know that we were both going,” Christian Bousey said. “My wife who is down on the floor, her first job was at a vintage store. She has been really into [thrifting] her entire life. So we do this a lot.”
Christian’s brother Max and Suzanne Bousey on the other hand were thrifting for their teenage kids.
“I bought some clothes for my son,” Suzanne says. “We are going to buy some artwork for our daughter. And I’m going to buy a bracelet.” Max began shaking his head and laughing. “I found the most expensive booth,” Suzanne added.
Similarly to Christian’s wife, it became hard to make a decision on what not to buy once shoppers started perusing the booths. Brianna Rockwell, a fellow thrifter, summarized this feeling neatly.
“I am here with a couple of friends who are out buying some other stuff,” she said. “We love to thrift and buy cool things and we saw that [Retromania] was happening… So here we are!”
With a smile on her face and dressed in bright pink, Rockwell matched the vivacious booth that she was looking at. Arriving at the event, she was not expecting to buy anything.
“I have now purchased four or five things and I am about to purchase some of these prints. I just haven’t decided which ones yet,” Rockwell said.
The second floor mezzanine had a different assortment of vendors: local food caterers and restaurants. Featuring smaller, special order bakeries such as Hetty Sweets Bakery and Donna’s Cakes or established restaurants like SamosaMan, attendees — including those with dietary restrictions — were guaranteed to find something that would satiate their appetite. If event-goers were not hungry in the moment, vendors such as Bee Well Box offered a selection of honey-related take home goods sure to elevate someone’s pantry. With seating from these restaurant spaces situated on a balcony, people were able to rest comfortably while overlooking the event. Whether resting, eating, or buying clothes, everyone was always able to take part in the communal atmosphere present at Roadrunner’s Retromania.
If one is looking for the perfect piece to add to their wardrobe or has a passion for collectibles from the past, be on the lookout for this event and more like it in the coming year. Brighton Bazaar hosts monthly events and expos much like this one. Based not only on the efficiency of this event but also the turnout it attracted, it’s certain the event organizers know exactly what they are doing when it comes to enabling talented entrepreneurs, artists, and creatives to make a name for themselves.
Samantha Gottlich said it best:
“I am so lucky to be [here]. I just love retro stuff. It’s a great community.”

In the dimly lit basement of Harvard’s WHRB radio station, the band sidebody delivered a tantalizing benefit performance to raise money for the Boston Area Rape Crisis Center (BARCC). Dressed in uniforms fit for a classroom, sidebody members Martha Schnee, Hava Horowitz, Lena Warnke, and Cara Giaimo called attention to the ongoing battle over justice for Harvard students who have experienced sexual harassment. During the concert the band announced their commitment to helping their community seek justice for survivors, and songs from their set included themes of male cowardice, rebirth, and chaotic creativity.
The theme of “This American Sidebody” dominated the concert in four acts, beginning with Act One: Before Life. The low, lonesome strum of Warnke on guitar introduced the song “instinct” from sidebody’s album of the same name. As the song picked up in tempo, lead vocalist Horowitz danced facing away from the crowd , juxtaposing sultry, seductive dancing with an air of sensual rage. Throughout the concert, the band’s performance ebbed and flowed with — with whispers immediately followed by screams sounding in call and response fashion — which amplified their overarching theme of retaliation against abuse. It was more than a concert — the members commanded attention and the entire room was enthralled in their every move.
After finishing “instinct,” the band members hummed in unison. Schnee paced around the crowd, inviting members of the crowd to join in on their vocal harmony to begin their performance of “blood.” The band solely focused on their voices for an a capella performance and excluded the sounds of strings and drums. This did not, however, stop lead vocalist Horowitz from using her body as an instrument throughout the show. In “atonement” and “ up/down,” Horowitz fell limp with each decrescendo, at times crouching to the floor in a fetal position to create a cocoon-like cover out of her black zip up hoodie. The band finished one of their songs lying on the floor, appearing to have “died” before rising in reincarnation.
During Act Two: The Afterlife, guitarist Giaimo reminded the crowd of the opportunity to donate to BARCC and reach out to relevant campus groups including Our Harvard Can Do Better and the Harvard Graduate Student’s Union: Feminist Working Group. Giaimo affirmed sidebody’s commitment to “end sexual violence in our community, especially here at Harvard.” After commenting that they were about to do something “a little bit funky,” the band asked the night's guest vocalist, Amulya Mandava, to join them to sing a few songs. Then, the band members encouraged the crowd to stand up during their cover of Donovan’s 1966 hit, “Season of the Witch.”
The final sets of the concert, Act Three: The Life and Act Four: The End, were characterized by thrilling chemistry between the members of sidebody. Giaimo and Warnke traded their bass and guitar and Schnee pressed her drumsticks to the strings of their instruments to create chaotic, dissonant sounds. Schnee moved to the front of the stage for their last song. “Our last song is a shout-out to cowards near and far,” Schnee said. Another slow strum marked the intro to, “coward,” with the entire band screaming the lyrics, “I’m so tired!” in unison.
Following the last scream, Schnee whispered once more, “I’m so tired” as the room filled with silence. The band looked at each other, smiling with satisfaction at their now finished performance. Schnee thanked the crowd before saying with a smirk, “Our class is finished here.”

“Love to Hate You,” a new K-drama streaming on Netflix, opens by showing the main character in various stages of likeability: One moment, she beats up a mugger with some impressive martial arts moves, and the next, we see her cheating on her boyfriend. “Men do it all the time,” she quips by way of excuse, leaving the audience unsure whether to laugh or raise an eyebrow. The rest of the show similarly falls short. Though it attempts to open a meaningful conversation about misogyny, its execution plants it firmly in simple feel-good rom-com territory.
The show follows the love story between Mi-ran (Kim Ok-bin), a young lawyer with a hidden talent for martial arts, and Kang-ho (Teo Yoo), an A-list actor with a false reputation for kindness. The grounds of their enmity — the highly anticipated enemies to lovers plot — are initially flimsy and implausible, beginning with offhand comments and instigated actions from the arrogant actor followed by immature retaliations by Mi-ran. However, Kang-ho’s behavior proves to be genuinely problematic as he makes degrading comments about women in the workforce, and the show’s treatment of Kang-ho’s conduct is even worse. “Women are busy flirting and [just] slack off on work,” Kang-ho spits derisively while enjoying drinks in a ritzy high-rise. He repeatedly assumes that women only enter spaces in order to woo a rich man, and only gains respect for Mi-Ran once she shows that she’s not like other girls (think Y/N Wattpad fanfiction). “I’ve never met a woman like that,” Kang-Ho muses thoughtfully after Mi-ran becomes his martial arts teacher, as if she finally met some threshold of interest to become worthy of his attention. It is never condemned that Kang-ho’s attraction is conditional upon Mi-ran proving herself special and different, through her unconventional hobbies and can-do demeanor. In this way, instead of uplifting women or challenging this patriarchal perspective, the show falls back on traditional tropes.
To make matters worse, in attempting to subvert the typical fairy tale love story that befalls so many K-Dramas, “Love to Hate You” ends up providing a cop-out answer to this problem of casual and flippant sexism. Through ridiculous, improbable excuses, the show attempts to absolve Kang-ho of complete responsibility for his arrogant remarks, meaning his character is largely deprived of any meaningful growth. “Love to Hate You” attempts to humanize Kang-ho through his tragic backstory, but in the process, ends up partially blaming other women for Kang-ho’s misogyny, allowing him to progress through the rest of the series unchanged. “I fell for you because you weren't like other women,” Kang-ho echoes in episode nine, going on to explain how the women in his life have contributed to his biased outlook. In fact, in episode eight, titled “The Way You Change Me,” Kang-ho’s learning is limited to a single moment in which Mi-ran must take initiative and open the conversation about the damsel-in-distress stereotype, while he simply stands there dumbfounded. So much for change.
Despite this, the show is not overall unenjoyable. Though the premise and development of their fake-dating is shaky, their spontaneous romantic moments (and even Kang-ho’s dramatic public gestures) are admittedly sweet in their vulnerability. For example, after a long day at work, all the lawyers at Mi-ran’s new firm sprint gleefully out to the cars for a night on the town, like Harvard students fleeing the Science Center on a Friday afternoon. Another day at work, Mi-ran walks in on her coworkers vigorously practicing a K-pop dance in full business suits. It’s these mundane moments, unfettered by the show’s convoluted themes, that somewhat redeem “Love to Hate You.”
Furthermore, though the series gets off to a rocky start, its law-related subplots expose real disparities in Korea’s gender pay gap and workplace culture. After learning she is a diversity hire as the only female applicant, Mi-ran retreats to the restroom, spirits crushed and mourning her naivety at thinking she had fairly “bested all those men.” Moments of female solidarity, especially between Mi-ran and her older client fighting for a divorce against her cheating husband (Kim Sung-Ryung), act as welcome moments of respite from the rest of the show's questionable treatment of misogyny. Though the show moves on quickly from these subplots, it is an accurate and poignant portrayal of some of the challenges that Korean women in the workforce face.
Inevitably, the headstrong Mi-ran, who swears off all men in the first episode after a string of disheartening experiences, comes to regret her words. The show does allow Kang-ho to become educated as he is partially “cured” of his casual misogyny by his love for Mi-ran — however, this is a very shallow exploration of the real, pervasive sexism present in Mi-ran’s life. In this way, “Love to Hate You” misses the opportunity to provide nuance to the typical exceptionalist narrative. While it’s alright that a K-drama ends up being little more than a slightly convoluted enemies-to-lovers-meets-fake-dating rom-com, it had — and wasted — the potential to become so much more.

Philip Marlowe is back on the big screen for the first time since the 1970s, this time in the concisely titled “Marlowe,” directed by Neil Jordan. Liam Neeson, now 70, is the oldest actor to bring the famed private investigator to life on screen, surpassing Robert Mitchum, who starred in the two most recent Marlowe films. Neeson, however, brings his own aged stoic action hero flavor to the classic character. The film’s story follows tried-and-true noir conventions, while the use of color and the foregrounding of graphic violence makes it stand apart from its classic antecedents.
Jordan’s “Marlowe” begins with a groggy Philip Marlowe getting out of bed, into his night robe, and preparing for the day in his quiet hillside bungalow. This scene recalls the opening of Robert Altman’s “The Long Goodbye,” the landmark neo-noir film starring Elliott Gould as a reinvented 1970s Philip Marlowe. However, Gould’s young Marlowe wakes up in yesterday’s clothes, unshaven and dirty. Neeson is introduced as a more composed version of this famous protagonist. From the start, “Marlowe” is at once a homage to its forerunners as well as a new, more matured take on a classic genre.
Neeson’s Marlowe also lacks the cynical wisecracking charisma of an Elliott Gould or Bogart, notable Marlowes of yesteryear. Nevertheless, Neeson’s reserve makes his infrequent outbursts that much more exciting in the scenes where the film allows for his action star persona to come out. While wielding a gun or picking up and tossing an evil henchman, Neeson’s quiet power shines through. While those who seek the witty, biting one-liners of a classic noir gumshoe may be disappointed by Neeson’s portrayal, his slow-moving, imposing six-foot-4-inch presence has its own effect.
Visually, the break from classic noir is clear from the start. The establishing cityscape shots are not shadowy, grimy, and grayscale but rather rendered in colorful CGI with a digital gleam. A cinematographic cleanliness pervades much of the film, in striking contrast to the visual grittiness of classic noir and neo-noir. Even a film like “Blade Runner,” which was an important reference for Jordan, surpasses “Marlowe” in capturing the seedy underbelly of dystopian Los Angeles by using dramatic lighting, cluttered sets, and emphatic colors to much greater effect. In this last respect, however, “Marlowe” does succeed in climactic sequences, where the use of color punctuates Neeson and his new-found sidekick’s descent into the bowels of the city.
The film, however, makes up for its lack of visual grittiness through repeated uses, if not abuses, of graphic violence, brought to life in bright color. “Marlowe” chooses to foreground the violence in many instances where older films might have toned it down. Violence is indisputably a staple of the genre; however, there is no subtlety in the bullet-riddling of characters, the graphic brutalized corpses, and, most strikingly, a car running over somebody’s head. For better or worse, graphic violence is a vivid spectacle in this film more so than in most of its noir counterparts, save for, perhaps, the inspirational “Blade Runner.”
The script, by William Monahan (“The Departed”) sticks to form. Quippy dialogue, chock full of curses, slurs, and innuendos, propels the movie. New characters and plot developments are introduced at every turn; murders, betrayals, and even a mid-movie columbarium chase scene keep the movie engaging. With all these twists and turns, the film quickly establishes a convoluted, web-like plot to rival any classic noir. While the confusing storyline is a nice homage to the noir of old, it can have the negative effect of diminishing the climactic payoff.
As long as you do not get lost between the fast-paced dialogue and the slow-paced movement of the now-elderly, though still powerful, lead actor, “Marlowe” will pay dividends as a modern reworking of a classic genre, albeit with less authentic grittiness and perhaps an over-reliance on compensatory graphic violence.

“Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” opens joyously with Marvel’s fan-favorite superhero, Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), front and center. Strolling down the street, Lang makes his usual quippy remarks, cracks hilarious dad jokes, and flashes his signature smile. However, within minutes, it becomes clear that this is not the typical “Ant-Man” movie that Marvel fans have grown to know and love.
For a film starting off Phase Five of movie releases of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” is an unfortunate letdown. Other than having the familiar faces of Scott, Scott’s daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton), Hope (Evangeline Lilly), Hank (Michael Douglass), and Janet (Michelle Pfieffer), the light-hearted tone that originally made Ant-Man so unique has been buried under bad writing, a dull plot, and shotty visual effects.
When the movie was first teased in 2022, it was rumored that Marvel’s number one goofball would face off against the MCU’s new, post-Thanos big villain: Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors). The crux of “Quantumania” is that Scott Lang has always been running out of time, and it is only right for him to go head-to-head with the man who controls it.
In the original “Ant-Man” (2015), hidden under all the humor is a deeply emotional thread: All Lang wants is to be with his daughter, but after repeatedly leaving to save the world he ultimately loses that which he desires so much. The second film in the trilogy follows that same theme. This third movie, however, while attempting to stay true to this thread, does not focus enough on Ant-Man. Any remnants of the original films are replaced with a new focal point: The future of the MCU.
The main objective of “Quantumania” is to introduce Kang the Conqueror, a multiversal supervillain with variants across every timeline. As this new big villain, Majors’s performance is phenomenal. Anytime he is on screen, he steals the show. With so many lines that feel reused and unoriginal, Majors is somehow able to deliver a stellar performance. He brings anger and regret into the MCU in a way Thanos (Josh Brolin) never could. But, Majors’s acting is not inescapable from bad writing. “Quantumania” provides a much needed backstory to the MCU’s new villain while also clearly forgetting that this is not Kang’s movie. Ant-Man becomes the side-character in his own film, and his daughter has more runtime than him.
Similar to most Marvel movies released in the past year, “Quantamania” attempts to pass the superhero mantle on to the next generation. In “Thor: Love and Thunder” (2022), Marvel fans were introduced to Thor’s “daughter.” In “Doctor Strange: Multiverse of Madness” (2022), new character America Chavez learns to control her powers. In “Quantumania,” the same can be said about Cassie Lang, as she will soon take her father’s place as the small but incredibly mighty hero, Stature. Nonetheless, Marvel tries to hide this uninspired plot repetition under the promise of a terrifying villain and flashy visuals.
As the name suggests, most of “Quantumania” takes place in the quantum realm. Introduced in “Ant-Man and the Wasp” (2018), the quantum realm is a trippy micro-universe. The visuals had the promise of being vibrant and having the potential to play with scale, but instead it looks more like a galaxy screensaver than an intricately designed, immersive universe. Upon the trailer’s release in October, fans likened the movie’s visual aesthetic to the low-budget “Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over.” As it turns out, they were not far off.
It is no secret that Marvel has a plan for the coming years (past 2025, apparently), and “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” is just one of many movies that will will help make this bigger picture a reality. However, that forward-facing objective does not make for a fantastic stand-alone plot. So, if you are going for good writing and a fun watch, this is not the Marvel film for you. But, if you are watching to simply avoid getting left behind by Marvel’s never-ending future build-up, this is a must-watch.

For 52 years, the enchanting music of Saharan Rock band Ahl Nana remained hidden from most ears. Recorded by Boussiphone Studios in Casablanca, Morocco, in 1971, the album “L’Orchestre National Mauritanien” was undistributed and dust-covered until Belgium company Radio Martiko recently rediscovered them and released them on Feb 3. As a result, Ahl Nana escaped the fate of being lost in storage and is reborn into the musical world today. The record not only delivers an aweing harmony of distinctive instruments and voices, but also brings the rich history of Saharan folk music to light.
Ahl Nana is one of the first known Saharan bands to include modern instruments such as the electric guitar. In all of their tracks, the electric guitar communicates with the traditional desert folk instruments, which creates an assonant discourse between the present and past. Occasionally, the guitar subtly follows the twanged notes of the fiddle, enhancing its folkish songs. At other times, the modern instrument makes use of its electricity, and rings out blue or fiery melodies. In this way, “L’Orchestre National Mauritanien” is not an album defined by genre, but one that explores it.
Just as Ahl Nana’s music illustrates a conversation between the past and present, so do its members. The band is a family, where the parents take up the traditional instruments and the children experiment with the contemporary ones. In the album cover, the matriarch, Debya Mint Soueid Bouh, sits in the left center on the floor. As seen in the photo, she is the talented violin player whose strings distinctively mark the band’s sound. The son and vocalist, Yassine Ould Nana, squats in the lower right corner. Decades after first recording the album, Ould Nana continued to produce music in the ’80s and ’90s, pairing uptempo disco songs with classic ’80s video-making techniques.
Upon listening to “L’Orchestre National Mauritanien,” the listener’s first instinct is to stop, and the second is to smile. The most popular song, “Adji Kar Teri Miri,” is at its heart communal, and invites the listener into that community too. It invokes that inborn desire to skip and swing and laugh. There is a sense of life and of home. Throughout the song, the same melody and lyrics reverberate and interact with each other, drawing in and out of intensity like the tide. Clear voices cascade over one another in waves, supporting Ould Nana and sometimes overtaking him. Occasionally, Ould Nana even imitates the resonant strain of the fiddle’s tune, his voice creating an all-captivating tension in the air.
“Adji Kar Teri Miri” is just one of ten songs in the album. While each track maintains the overarching theme of folk, rock, and blues, the individual songs are distinctive in tempo and tone. “Nahnou Sigharou El Ouatane,” for instance, is softer than the others, and highlights the chorus of voices in union with a slow, sweet melody from the electric guitar. “Yer Sabou Yerkoy,” on the other hand, is a light dance between the guitar and fiddle, and the singers withdraw to the background to the song. All of the songs are relatively long, around five to nine minutes, allowing the musicians to enter a circular rhythm, working and reworking the mesmeric melody.
Even though Ahl Nana’s music became available to stream on Apple Music only two weeks ago, the band still deeply contributed to the evolution of Saharan music, and marks a historic turning point in desert blues. Well known artists that followed the path that Ahl Nana began include Ali Farke Touré and Tanariwen. “L’Orchestre National Mauritanien” was revolutionary in its time, and despite all the decades that have passed, the album is just as refreshing now.

On Feb. 10, Paramore released “This Is Why” — their sixth studio album and first album in almost six years since they released “After Laughter” in 2017. Now, the three-piece pop-punk band (currently composed of Hayley Williams, Taylor York, and Zac Farro) is older and wiser, and they’ve come back with a mature, somewhat anxiety-fueled take on the discontent of living in today’s world. Although it’s an impressive addition to Paramore’s discography, “This Is Why”’s lyrics don't quite hit the mark.
Known for their explosive presence in the 2000s pop-punk and emo music scenes, Paramore has decidedly moved on from the teen angst of their earlier work.
“We don’t want to be a nostalgia band,” Williams said in an interview with Louder.
Thus far, they’ve succeeded. Paramore has never been afraid to change up their sound, from their more radio-friendly self-titled album to the bubbly, fake-happy “After Laughter.” Perhaps it should be expected, then, that their new album subverts expectations in a similar way.
“This Is Why” feels like a natural next step for the band. It combines the funky pop sound of “After Laughter” with the more subdued indie introspection of Williams’s recent solo projects like 2020’S “Petals For Armor”. Despite this evolution of their music, “This Is Why” still contains traces of Paramore’s older, angst-driven sound, albeit for a different generation and from an older perspective. The result is a post-punk meditation on pandemic-era bitterness and political outrage, and it’s by far the band’s most mature album to date.
The album’s focus on modern issues is evident right from its first song, the title track “This Is Why.” It’s a jittery, jumpy song that speaks to agoraphobia, perhaps due to the pandemic or simply from the many pressures of trying to survive in our present day. Propelled by glitchy, brash production, the rest of the album takes the listener through edgy stops and starts. The anxiety-inducing “The News” is a commentary on the never-ending cycle of upsetting global events. And “Big Man, Little Dignity,” a song about irresponsible men who get away with misdeeds, is both timeless and relatable in the current cultural climate.
However, the second half of “This Is Why” struggles to maintain the charged momentum that sustained its beginning. Instead, it’s bogged down by ballads such as “Liar” and “Crave,” which suffer from lackluster songwriting. While the more uptempo melodies of songs such as “The News” were enough to compensate for their lacking lyrical content, their shortcomings become apparent when paired with a more stripped-down tune. “Liar,” in particular, is frustratingly generic — a disappointment considering that Paramore has shown they’re capable of much more.
“This Is Why” is an album that relies on repetition, hammering in its points by spinning the listener in lyrical circles. But the songs aren’t distinct enough from each other for this repetition to be as potent as it could be. Because of this, the overall project suffers from sameness, both sonically and lyrically. After hearing four shouty songs about being anxious for the future, it’s easy to get bored. There are so many different angles one could take on modern frustrations and worries, but “This Is Why” feels uniformly on edge.
The album’s high points, nonetheless, are very high. The deliciously barbed earworm “You First” is a standout, as is the album closer “Thick Skull,” a sweeping yet introspective rock ballad that combines all the best aspects of the band’s diverse soundscape. Overall, “This Is Why” is a testament to Paramore’s longevity, showcasing the natural evolution and maturity of their sound. But it doesn’t quite feel worth waiting six years for.

Once upon a time
In a land not far away
There lived a humble bro-man.
For now, we’ll call him Jay.

Jay always scoffs at tourists.
And grunts while at the gym.
He thinks that everyone he meets
Is way less smart than him.

He calls all women “females”
And wears his collar popped.
He rants about his startup,
Then consulting, when that flopped.

He cries, “It’s the professor’s fault!”
When he receives a B.
He only hits on freshman girls
And yeah, he punched the Spee.

But Jay was not always this bad,
No, his descent was slow.
I’ll tell you how this freshman lad
Grew up to be a bro.

When Jay got into Harvard
He was happy as can be.
See, Jay believed with all his heart
In meritocracy.

“Hell yeah, they finally picked me!
They clearly were impressed.
Privilege? Ha. That’s not a thing.
I’m here ‘cause I’m the best.”

And so he came to campus
With a confidence unbridled.
The sort of poise that only comes
To those who feel entitled.

Jay started classes quickly
But whined and pouted plenty
“I hate that Harvard makes me
Take this stupid Expos 20!”
“Humanities are cute
If you don’t mind being poor.
But I don’t need to study art.
That’s what hobbies are for.”

And so Jay studied Econ
Or CS, or maybe Gov?
“But in the meantime,” Jay announced
“I think I’ll look for love.”

So Jay hit up the gym a lot
To try and get a date.
‘Cause someone told him good things come
To those who sit and weight.

When mirror selfies didn’t work
Our Jay got rather vexed.
“Why are women not entranced by
Pictures that I text?”

And so, when he got old enough,
He did what some boys do
When they need validation
But don’t know who to turn to.

Jay punched all of the final clubs.
Our boy was well connected!
But when his friend found out his plan
They quietly objected:

“You know those clubs are sexist, right?
And don’t let women in?
Unless it’s for a party,
In which case, they pack ‘em in.”

They pointed to a study
Which, in 2016 found,
That sexual assaults in final clubs
Tended to abound.

But Jay was like, “Dude, chill alright?
The vibe there really rocks.
Sure some women have been assaulted,
But I wanna join the Fox!”
So Jay turned to the party scene
And tried to win regard
But being white and privileged,
Well, it wasn’t all that hard.

He pissed on ol’ John Harvard
And he ran in primal scream.
He dove into the Charles
And partied to the extreme.

He hooked up with a lot of girls,
It turned into a sport.
He’d brag about it afterwards
Like some weird-ass report.

But worry not! Though he had fun,
Jay didn’t just relax.
He probably learned a lot ‘cause
He was always in the stacks.

Traveling through the Yard,
Self-assurance filled each limb.
He knew deep down that Harvard
Was designed for bros like him.

Jay man-spread to his heart’s content
And grew a trifle haughty
His Tinder bio read, “Just
lookin’ for the perfect shawty.”

The classroom was a stomping ground
That helped him stand apart.
He talked like a Thesaurus
Just to prove that he was smart!

Now Jay would never cheat, of course,
That’s wrong, without a doubt.
But should the pset prove too hard,
His friends could bail him out.

And every time Jay spoke, he
Just assumed that he was right,
Well dressed in Patagonias,
His front was quite polite.

But in the dusty clubhouses,
Outside the realm of class,
Jay had a different side to him.
One frankly, far more crass.

His jokes became misogynist.
And though he felt elite,
With every sexist word and act
His journey was complete.

Now, if you see yourself in
Any part of this here tale,
Or if you’ve seen such actions
In some other, haughty male,

Just know that there’s a million ways
Someone can be a bro.
But they’re all pretty bad,
So like, don’t do it, yo.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Prominent Harvard speakers and community members convened last week for the 2023 Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging Forum, themed “Reckoning and Transformation.” In the quest for “healing, restoration, and accountability,” this forum aimed to “elevate and prioritize truth-seeking and reckoning with our past in order to more fully understand our history and actions.”
Despite such ambitious aspirations to amplify Harvard’s institutional and systematic approach to diversity, one thing feels missing from the campus discussion of social justice: our role as society’s most privileged few.
We are told from the day we open our acceptance letters that Harvard is home — that we belong. But for the vast majority of applicants, let alone people, Harvard will never be home.
Harvard has made strides in improving racial diversity on campus, with consistently growing proportions of non-white students in each class year. However, our student body continues to hail from disproportionate wealth, with over two-thirds of Harvard students coming from the top fifth of the income distribution. Over half of Harvard students come from families in the top tenth of income earners, and nearly two-fifths of students in the top five percent. And more than one in every seven Harvard students comes from a family in the top one percent earning more than $630,000 every year.
These numbers should force us to acknowledge a fundamental paradox in our home. We imagine it to be a beacon of equity and inclusion; at the same time, we enjoy its benefits out of an inherently hyper-elite and privileged position.
I will not speak for anyone else’s experience at Harvard, and my intention is not to criticize any individual. Rather, I question how our community appears so hypersensitive to the inclusivity of one of the world’s most exclusive bubbles. Each of us, many on the basis of wealth or familial connection, has been granted rare access into this space. And yet we debate inclusivity without any accountability, lacking any urgency to understand our own privileges as beneficiaries of this hyper-elite institution.
The quest for diversity at a campus like Harvard may forever be constrained by the fact that, if unchanged, our institution will never reflect the society in which we live. For some, this is undoubtedly why Harvard is special: The access to a network of powerful, wealthy, and influential individuals it provides is unparalleled. But for others, it’s why this institution can feel suffocating: We observe necessary conversations on equity and diversity dominated by highly privileged individuals posing as authoritative figures on social justice.
Should we simply shrug our shoulders and cede to privilege and power? No. I firmly believe that the constant pursuit of equity and inclusion is so vital that it merits and necessitates rigorous discussion.
Rather, we need to address the overt contradictions in our approach to diversity, equity, and inclusion. It’s time to acknowledge that it is an immense privilege to philosophize on class and inequality in the comfort of a seminar or attend spiffy forums on political inclusion at the Institute of Politics, while simultaneously living a life with resources that the vast majority of people can only imagine. We should grapple directly with the contradictions that permeate Harvard, like the elite social clubs, long reserved for the most connected and well-endowed, that simultaneously seem to have made diversity and inclusion a priority. These contradictions should raise questions, concerns, and, most importantly, the standards we set for ourselves when we discuss — and practice — social justice.
I will never fully understand why an institution like Harvard, so exclusive and inaccessible, continues to dominate global discussions surrounding equity and justice. But I do know that some pills are tough to swallow: in this case, that the oppressive structures we read about, write about, and criticize in our classrooms are the same ones that brought many of us to this campus.
Over the course of three days, the EDIB forum grappled with pressing issues ranging from environmental racism to this institution’s legacy of slavery. We would all do well to participate in these kinds of conversations. What does it mean for us to unpack the intersections of class and global warming at an institution whose fossil fuel investments make up over a billion dollars of its endowment? How do we grapple with our institution’s deep ties to slavery as residents of undergraduate houses, like Mather and Winthrop, that memorialize our slave owning affiliates?
These questions, I hope, can drive us beyond ostentatious and limited discussions of social justice that dismiss ourselves from any accountability and instead move us towards recognition of our status as some of the greatest beneficiaries of the structures we often vehemently condemn.
Perhaps this article falls victim to its own critique: Only a privileged Harvard student would nitpick diversity initiatives from within his Cantabrigian sanctuary, as if anything he says could have a tangible impact beyond the walls of the ivory tower, and Crimson Editorial editors like myself have long positioned their overintellectual complaints as real movers of change in op-eds like these.
But I have faith that there is meaning in questioning our assumptions, approaching our daily conversations with greater intention, and reckoning with the fact that in our very own pursuit of equity, we benefit from the most inequitable positions of privilege.

We are the generation of mass shootings.
We are the generation that has come of age with gun violence. School shootings have grown up alongside us: From elementary, to middle, to high school, and now college, we have seen our peers shot down with increasing frequency. We are the students who graduate with degrees in lockdowns and normalized mass paranoia.
We are the generation taught to hide. We have learned to second guess a fire alarm out of fear that it could be a gunman trying to flush students into the hallway. We have crouched under desks and rushed to turn off classroom electronics as we drill, and drill, and drill the proper actions should an active shooter ever enter our building. We hope this protocol will persist in our muscle memories, if not readily accessible in our panic-petrified minds; we pray each infinitesimal adjustment to our postures will maximize our potential for survival. Our teachers cut the lights, yank shades over windows, and stash buckets of rocks in their desk drawers alongside surplus number two pencils. We leap out of windows and lock ourselves in storage closets.
We don’t make a sound.
We are the generation whose worst fears are realized regularly. “Run. Hide. Fight.” That was the message Michigan State University students received on February 13, when a gunman fatally shot three students and injured five others. According to the Washington Post, more than 338,000 of us have experienced gun violence in school since the Columbine school shooting in 1999. This is not just a drill in a classroom. This is real.
We are the generation that watches our backs. Any public setting is vulnerable to the epidemic of gun violence. Malls, clubs, concerts, and college campuses are only a few of the hundreds of places we frequent where the terrifying thought crosses our minds: What if it were to happen here? Where would we hide, where could we run? The back door of a lecture hall opens and the hairs on the back of our necks become electric. What if? When living on a college campus as open as Harvard’s, it’s hard not to let fear pervade the architecture of our everyday life.
We are the generation that suppresses our emotions. We have become an excruciating combination of overanxious and desensitized in response to the staggering number of mass shootings in this country. There have been 80 mass shootings so far in 2023, over the span of just a handful of weeks — yet our lives must continue on. So we try not to think about it. Every time a new tragedy replaces another one in the headlines, we add it to a collection of worries festering in silence, the wounds too repetitive to ever fully be unpacked. We cannot help but wonder what effect this toll has on our national psyche — and on our mental health.
We are the generation of sorrow. We mourn for the students who lost their lives in the tragic shooting at Michigan State, a calamity that should never have transpired. We offer our deepest condolences to their families and friends, who have been added to the ever-growing list of loved ones whose lives will forever be scarred along the contours of gun violence.
We are the generation demanding solutions. Mass shootings, a uniquely American problem, are also caused by overwhelmingly white and male perpetrators, making this violence frustratingly difficult to disentangle from other societal issues. Still, there’s a reason why “Common Sense” gun legislation is called “Common Sense”:  Fewer guns means fewer shootings. Other countries, like Australia, have successfully combated these tragedies with legislative force. When will we do the same?
Time and time again, we have heard our government’s message loud and clear: guns over lives. We do not gain any new insights the more we wait — we are tired of begging for scraps of a solution. We wonder how many more breaths we will waste on unheard pleas while our peers must ration them in too-silent classrooms, suffocating themselves to survive.
We are the generation asking for change.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the last few weeks, Harvard’s contingent faculty campaigned to form a union and organized their first rally, urging the University to increase compensation, job security, and other workplace protections. For many, it may be hard to empathize with the faculty’s grievances. After all, who could complain about teaching at one of the top universities in the world?
But for adjuncts — part-time professors paid per course — it’s not all glitz and glamor. In fact, across the country, higher education continues to underpay and overwork this faculty underclass.
The adjunct problem has grown as universities have started to increasingly hire part-time labor. From an economic standpoint, this move makes sense: Tenured professors are expensive investments under long-term contracts, whereas adjuncts are cheap hires that can be laid off more easily. However, when university professors are paid so little that they are forced to sleep in their cars and apply for food stamps, it might be time for a change.
Adjuncts are often imagined as successful experts with jobs outside academia who dabble in teaching to make a little extra money. But these big names actually only represent a small portion of the adjunct population. Far more common are so-called “freeway flyers” who rely on meager teaching wages as their primary income. To compensate for low salaries, a majority of adjuncts take on a full-time course load — plus second and third jobs — to make ends meet.
A 2019 survey of over 3,000 contingent faculty — 79 percent of whom self-reported as adjuncts — offers insights to the precarity of the adjunct position. The median respondent in the survey earns between $3,000-$3,500 per course — a strikingly small amount. Nearly two-thirds of respondents earn under $50,000 annually across all jobs, not enough to reach financial security for a family of four. Around a quarter reported problems accessing adequate food and housing.
What’s more, for 75 percent of respondents, employment is only guaranteed semester to semester. Many adjunct instructors aren’t informed about their teaching appointments until a few weeks prior to the beginning of the term. And in times of crisis, such as a pandemic, adjuncts tend to be the first to receive pay cuts or get laid off.
This endemic low pay not only imperils the livelihood of these professors, but inevitably impacts educational quality for students as well. Adjuncts stretching their time across multiple institutions simply cannot devote the necessary energy to engage with their students. Departments that are primarily made up of adjuncts, often in the humanities, experience higher job turnover rates, leading to a revolving door of instructors lacking institutional knowledge and continuity.
Harvard’s adjuncts aren’t the only group beginning to organize in response to poor working conditions. Adjunct faculty at Loyola University Chicago and Boston University voted to unionize in the past decade, and adjuncts at Fordham University and American University have recently negotiated contracts with their administrations. But often, any wage increases remain pitifully small, and universities are hard negotiators. For instance, union leaders bargained with George Washington University for 18 whole months before increasing adjunct salaries by a measly $533 per course.
Of course, the logic of the marketplace suggests that if universities can find cheap labor, they should do so; that’s just supply and demand, right? But universities should be trying to attract the best and brightest professors, not maximize profit. Plus, institutions are already cutting costs by hiring contingent faculty in the first place. For instructors who have pursued advanced degrees but have not been awarded a full-time position for whatever reason, a living wage seems more than reasonable.
Universities might argue that not all adjuncts have degrees equivalent to tenure-track professors and that it would be a logistical and financial nightmare to get rid of part-time labor in academia. Nevertheless, those are insufficient excuses for failing to treat adjunct faculty with the decency of a living wage. Yet, institutions brush off concerns about adjunct mistreatment far too readily.
Here are some immediate and practical solutions that universities across the country can implement to improve adjunct well-being and thus the quality of education received by undergraduates. First, institutions should index the adjunct pay per course to local living conditions. No adjunct teaching a full course load should struggle to feed a family of four. Second, adjunct pay raises should match full-time faculty pay raises, at least on a percentage basis. Finally, institutions should inform adjunct faculty at least a semester in advance if they cannot be rehired the following term.
It’s high time we start treating adjuncts with the respect they deserve — both for their own sake and to ensure higher quality education for the students they teach.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Undergraduate Association officers voted to split funding allocations between clubs and student subsidy initiatives during their weekly general meeting on Saturday.
The total amount disbursed for spring semesterly club funding is $166,000 — $8,500 higher than the previous semester due to the reallocation of the entire budget for the Extracurricular Team into club funding. The Finance Team released their spring 2023 semesterly funding decisions for club funding in two separate batches on Feb. 19 and Feb. 20.
The decision was made in response to the 50 percent increase in funding requests received by the HUA from student clubs for spring 2023, HUA Treasurer Alexander J. Zurovec ’25 said during the meeting.
“Of course, we need more funding,” Zurovec said. “It’s not a very sustainable way to fund with such little allocation from the DSO, but we’re doing the best we can.”
The DSO allocated $550,000 to the HUA for the 2022-2023 academic year, marking a 10 percent increase from annual budgets under its predecessor — the Undergraduate Council — but significantly less than the $682,000 the body had requested.
Officers also voted on Saturday in favor of reallocating $1,500 from the Sports Team budget to the Finance Team in order to fund club sports.
The Residential Life Team will exhaust its remaining $19,600 budget on the funding of three projects that were approved by vote during the meeting. One of these projects is to purchase Blue Bikes passes in bulk and distribute them to students, spending no more than roughly $3,200.
“The benefit of this program mainly lies in the fact that when we buy a lot of passes, they give us quite a discount per pass — about 33 percent off,” Residential Life Officer David Y. Zhang ’23 said. “Because the HUA is the one going out to purchase this — effectively with student money funded from the Student Activities fee — we help students save money in general.”
Another approved project by the Residential Life Team will provide $1,600 worth of laundry detergent to be distributed to laundry rooms around campus.
The final project is a continuation of a program offered by the HUA last year in partnership with Five Star Movers, which provided subsidized boxes for students to store their belongings over the summer. Last fall, some participants said they found the program confusing and disorganized.
Officers implemented changes to provide more funding to the program, begin drop-offs earlier, and increase the number of drop-off and pick-up days. With a strict limit of 6,000 total boxes — an increase from the 5,400 boxes purchased last semester — the program is set to accommodate a maximum of 10 boxes per student at a rate of $15 per box.
“We know that last year and in previous years, there have been mishaps with the program with communication or operational challenges,” HUA Co-President Travis Allen Johnson ’24 said. “So we’re starting this program early to ensure that the operations and logistics are seamless and go according to plan.”
Officers also voted to allocate $3,000 of the Social Life Team’s budget toward the creation of the F.U.N. fund, which will reimburse students for the cost of social activities with friends at a cap of $10 per student for up to 10 students. Students can only benefit from the program once, said Social Life Officer John S. Cooke ’25.
The HUA also voted in favor of a proposal by Fez S. Zafar ’24 to allocate $300 from the Executive Team budget to fund a game of Harvard Assassin for juniors.
“We had a really bizarre freshman year where we were online. A lot of members of the class of ’24 didn’t have the chance to properly meet each other,” Zafar said. “It’s really a great way for people to get to know one another and really to just do something in a unified manner.”
Saturday’s general meeting marked the last gathering of the HUA before the results of the body’s officer elections are released.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Boba shop Möge Tee held its grand opening in Harvard Square with a traditional lion dance performance and free drinks for its first 50 customers on Sunday.
Located on 54 JFK St., Möge Tee is the fourth boba shop in the Square, alongside Kung Fu Tea, Gong Cha, and Tiger Sugar. On opening day, customers lined up in the crowded shop while loud drums accompanied a colorful lion dance outside.
Möge Tee’s menu boasts a selection of classic milk and matcha teas, cheese foam teas, and signature fruit teas. The chain operates more than 380 locations worldwide, with more than 60 locations in the U.S., including a shop in Central Square.
So Lim Ting, co-owner of the Harvard Square and Central Square locations, said he decided to open the Square location due to the “success from the Central Square location with MIT students.”
Möge Tee currently occupies the former location of Boston Tea Stop, which closed down in December 2021.
In comparison with other boba shops in the Square, Ting said Möge Tee is particularly famous for their fruit teas.
“We want to display the freshness of Möge Tee,” Ting said. “Möge Tee is very known for its fresh fruits, fresh ingredients that we use and display in the fridge.”
Despite the large demand for bubble tea in Cambridge, students shared mixed opinions about a fourth boba shop coming into town.
“I think that it’s really amazing that we have all these different choices now,” Jang G. Choe ’26 said. “At the same time, I can’t help but wonder if they’re all just going to cannibalize each other.”
“I think it might really come down to location and cost,” Choe added.
Carolyn “Carly” Y. Chen ’26 said the store has a “nice atmosphere,” but she said she wishes there were more seating.
“They also have a larger variety,” Chen said. “In whole, I really liked their menu. I want to try it out.”
Though Ting is considering more locations in the future, he said he is planning to initially focus on the current location.
“There may be more coming, but our first goal is we want to be the best Harvard boba ever,” he said.

The Harvard Management Company boosted its investments in Grab — a Singaporean all-in-one app offering food delivery, transportation, and digital payment services — and modified its biotechnology portfolio during the last quarter of 2022, according to a Feb. 10 financial disclosure.
HMC — which stewards Harvard’s $50.9 billion endowment — increased its holdings in Grab by 40 percent, to a total of 13 million shares at the end of December. HMC first purchased 2 million Grab shares in December 2021 at a price of $7.13 per share. At the end of 2022, HMC’s Grab shares were valued at $3.22 apiece, representing a decline of more than 50 percent.
Harvard’s investment arm discloses its direct public holdings each quarter, as is required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for managers with more than $100 million of investments. HMC’s direct public portfolio totaled $806 million during the fourth quarter of 2022, representing just 1.6 percent of the total value of Harvard’s endowment.
John M. Longo, a professor at Rutgers Business School and chief investment officer at Beacon Trust, wrote in an email that the increased shares in Grab represent a long-term growth opportunity.
“Grab is akin to the Uber of Southeast Asia, outside of China. It operates in a big market, but the company is currently not profitable. It has $6.5 billion in cash on its balance sheet so it should be able to fund the near-term losses until the company becomes profitable,” Longo wrote.
Longo also noted that Grab is based in an emerging market, which he wrote could have contributed to HMC’s decision to purchase more stocks in the company.
“Emerging market (EM) stocks were among the biggest losers in 2022 and are trading at depressed valuations so HMC’s addition of Grab may be also a play on a rebound in EM,” he said.
Consistent with previous quarters, technology companies occupied a large fraction of HMC’s public portfolio. HMC continued to directly own more stock in Alphabet, the parent company of Google, than any other publicly traded company, with its holdings in the tech giant totaling $213 million at the end of 2022.
Additionally, HMC’s holdings in Meta, formerly known as Facebook, were valued at $137 million.
The value of HMC’s investments in Scientific Games Corporation, a gambling company, ballooned by 37 percent, representing the company’s second-largest position — a title held by Meta for the previous two quarters.
In its largest liquidation of the quarter, HMC sold off 1.4 million shares of EQRx, an oncology and immunology biotechnology company based in Cambridge. The stock experienced a steady decline in share price over the past three months amid the company’s November announcement that it would shelve trials for one of its pharmaceuticals and push back a regulatory filing for another to 2027.
HMC did not invest in exchange-traded funds — managed funds that offer exposure to many underlying securities — during the fourth quarter of 2022.
Harvard has come under fire in recent years for its ETF investments, which activist groups such as the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign allege constitute the University’s indirect exposure to the private prison industry. HMC sold off its ETF investments at the end of 2021.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard students and affiliates participated in the University’s second annual Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging Forum last week under the theme “Reckoning and Transformation,” gathering for keynote speakers, mixers, and performances.
The three-day forum — which was hosted in a hybrid format by the Office for Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging — included speakers from the Harvard Museum of Science and Culture, the Harvard University Native American Program, and Harvard’s faculty.
The forum featured a keynote speech from founder and president of Justice for Migrant Women Moníca Ramírez and a conversation with vice provost Sarah Bleich, who will oversee the implementation of Harvard’s Legacy of Slavery initative.
Harvard’s Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer Sherri A. Charleston, who both attended and spoke at the event, wrote in an email to The Crimson that the forum was intended to provide Harvard affiliates with an opportunity to learn about diversity initiatives.
“The EDIB Forum, for me, is about passing the mic to those who don’t regularly have opportunities to participate, share ideas, or ask questions on a University-wide platform,” Charleston wrote. “There is a wealth of expertise here at Harvard, and the Forum is an opportunity for all of us, me included, to learn with and from nationally recognized experts.”
The event included discussion around Harvard’s reckoning with its legacy of slavery, Gen Z activism, and the ethical stewardship of the Harvard Museum Collections.
The forum occurred in light of controversy surrounding the stewardship of the remains of 19 individuals of African, African-American, and Brazilian descent who were likely to have been enslaved. According to a report by the University’s Steering Committee on Human Remains in Harvard Museum Collections, Harvard museums house the remains of more than 22,000 human individuals.
Steering Committee chair and former Harvard College Dean Evelynn M. Hammonds discussed the task force’s recommendations on how the University should treat human remains in a panel.
“It is really important that we recognize here that treating these individuals with care and dignity means treating them first and foremost as individuals,” Hammonds said. “Understanding them as individuals is complex and will require the time, respect, and sensitivity and research to identify as best we possibly can who these individuals are.”
During a Thursday panel entitled “Reckoning with the Legacy of Slavery at Harvard,” Tomiko Brown-Nagin — the dean of the Radcliffe Institute of Advanced Study and the chair of the Presidential Committee on Harvard and the Legacy of Slavery — discussed reactions to the release of the report.
“Whatever it is that people are conjuring when they think about Harvard, I can guarantee you it’s not entanglements with slavery and with the history that our own president — when we released the report — said was to some extent ‘shocking’ and even ‘shameful,’” Brown-Nagin said.
Martha S. Jones, a history professor at Johns Hopkins University, discussed the value of history and becoming the “stewards of an institutional reputation.”
“I think this work has made Harvard better and stronger — to be able to turn the lens on oneself and embrace that history in the way that we have and the way that the President has, and to be able to hold it up as an example of excellence,” Brown-Nagin said.
When reflecting on the forum, Charleston expressed her hopes to broaden the vision of Harvard’s past and future.
“This Forum’s theme is Reckoning & Transformation, and as a historian, I truly believe that the only way forward is to look honestly at our past and, not only envision, but take action to create more equity in our lives on campus, at home, and in our communities,” Charleston wrote. “This is only the beginning.”
Correction: February 21, 2023
A previous version of this article incorrectly attributed the quote “I think this work has made Harvard better and stronger — to be able to turn the lens on oneself and embrace that history in the way that we have and the way that the President has, and to be able to hold it up as an example of excellence,” to Martha S. Jones. In fact, this quote was said by Tomiko Brown-Nagin during the forum.

Harvard Athletic Director Erin McDermott declined to comment on recent allegations of emotional abuse levied by women’s ice hockey athletes against head coach Katey Stone but affirmed the importance of the department’s ongoing diversity and inclusion initiatives in an interview Friday.
The allegations against Stone were first reported in a Boston Globe investigation published last month. In the report, current and former players said longtime coach Stone downplayed injuries, dismissed players’ mental health issues, and made insensitive remarks.
In particular, the report detailed an incident where Stone described the team as having “too many chiefs and not enough Indians” following a first-round loss to Princeton in the Eastern College Athletic Conference playoffs last February.
“Harvard took prompt action and thoroughly reviewed Coach Stone’s self-reported use of a once frequently-used colloquialism that is now deemed culturally insensitive during a team meeting,” Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote earlier this month in an emailed statement regarding Stone’s behavior.
“While Harvard was unable to substantiate that any discriminatory conduct took place, it recognized — as Coach Stone did — that the use of this language should not occur,” Dane added.
Stone “immediately apologized” for her “insensitive language” following the game and apologized a second time in the days after, according to Dane.
“Harvard took further steps to support and maintain an inclusive, supportive environment by working with Coach Stone focused on improving communication skills,” Dane wrote in the statement.
On Friday, Harvard University Native American Program released a statement on Instagram in response to the Globe piece, “to recognize the bravery of Maryna Macdonald, the HUNAP student who went on record to recount firsthand the pain of these hurtful experiences.”
According to several former players, former athletic director Robert L. Scalise said in 2019 that the women’s ice hockey team was ranked Harvard’s worst team overall for athlete experience in varsity sports.
During Friday’s interview, McDermott pointed to an annual survey administered by Harvard Athletics at the end of their season regarding both athletic and campus experiences in order to get “a sense of how they feel their full lives are going at Harvard.”
The survey responses are “closely reviewed” by the sports administrators who oversee each program, and feedback is “shared directly” with head coaches each year, according to McDermott.
McDermott said Harvard Athletics will be administering a redesigned survey next year that resembles Harvard’s Q Guide, a course evaluation tool used by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. McDermott said the initiative was designed so athletes can fill out “something that’s familiar” in a survey that can “capture similar types of information.”
McDermott also discussed the following topics:
Harvard Athletics launched a Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging Task Force in 2020 to identify “areas of priority” and create “positive change and opportunities,” according to an announcement on the department’s website.
Since its establishment two-and-a-half years ago, two major accomplishments of the task force have been its training programs for coaches and staff and the department’s formal “statement of commitment” to diversity and inclusion, according to McDermott.
“We wanted to first start with staff, including coaches, so those working most closely with our students would be current on the language that we’re using, our understanding of things,” she said. “I think our students are in a different place, and so I wanted to make sure that our staff and people working with them were using the same language and had a similar understanding.”
McDermott said she hopes to begin including students in similar programs next year.
She said the committee is not responsible for addressing the diversity of coaching staff. Still, she said when openings arise, the department is “mindful” of diversity in the hiring process.
“For example — when we hired a women’s basketball coach last year — it’s not the reason we hired Carrie Moore, but it certainly was a positive that we were able to hire a really strong, talented women’s basketball coach who is also African American,” McDermott said.
The department also aims to recruit athletes each year who are reflective of the diversity of the broader undergraduate student body.
“We certainly are wanting to be contributing to the overall mission of the University and to the College and the initiative of having a diverse community,” McDermott said.
McDermott pointed to student engagement, among both athletes and other students, as a key success of the past few years, particularly in light of the Covid-19 pandemic.
“In a way, we kind of saw a bump because of a Covid effect of people just wanting to have the experience, be together. It was really part of the community,” she said. “I was a little concerned that that might then recede once it became normal again, but we’ve actually seen that continue, which has been exciting.”
According to McDermott, the department has been able to more closely monitor student engagement with athletic events through CrimZone — an app which rewards students for attending games.
McDermott said the targeted student engagement efforts have paid off.
“With our women’s basketball program this year, we’ve doubled our sales to their events,” McDermott said. “We’ve sold out of men’s basketball games and men’s hockey games this season at a higher clip than we have in the recent past, and our football attendance was also up.”
Alumni networks have also helped make Harvard Athletics a “robust operation,” McDermott said, referencing both fundraising and networking opportunities for athletes.
“Every sport has a friends group,” McDermott said. “They’re really helpful to us in bringing in some funding that we need to help do the things that we’re trying to accomplish in the department.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Massachusetts Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79 and Lt. Governor Karyn E. Polito rolled out new healthcare programs for residents regardless of health insurance status to a network of 25 Community Behavioral Health Centers across the state last month.
The launch of the centers forms the backbone of the Baker-Polito administration’s Roadmap for Behavioral Health Reform, which was put into effect last month and aims to provide easy access to mental health and substance use services to Massachusetts residents. Hundreds of residents have accessed the programs — which include a 24-hour behavioral health hotline, urgent care, and 24-hour mobile crisis services — since the rollout.
The Cambridge Health Alliance houses the only CBHC in Cambridge. Joan Taglieri, a senior director at CHA, lauded the initiative for improving access to mental health care, which she said decreased during the pandemic.
“This initiative was focused very much on access to behavioral health services, which has been horrible for many, many, many years before the pandemic and then got just that much worse during the pandemic — both because of the loss of workforce, but also because the increase in the behavioral health need that was a consequence of the pandemic,” Taglieri said.
Before the launch of the CBHCs, Taglieri said clinics offering behavioral health care were “woefully underpaid” — a problem addressed by the the state initiative.
“The payment has often been less than the cost of delivering the service,” she said. “And that has had a big impact on the availability of behavioral health services because you have agencies who are going to have to worry about losing money if they try to expand services to meet the need.”
The state doubled the reimbursement for centers providing behavioral health services and provided startup funding, which the CHA used to train new clinical staff.
Sarah Stoddard-Gunn, a program leader and licensed social worker at CHA, said behavioral health centers have certain advantages over typical providers of mental health care.
“It's very different than a standard mental health clinic where, like a large mental health clinic, there’s often a long, lengthy waitlist referral process. There are often barriers to access, like needing a primary care doctor in the system,” Stoddard-Gunn said. “We offer different ways to access care.”
“It's really nice to not have a massive bureaucracy, and when someone needs help, they can walk in and get something,” Stoddard-Gunn added.
Patients needing support are typically able to walk in to see a therapist, though appointments can also be scheduled ahead of time. If a patient catches the clinic at a shift change, a “brief safety check-in” will be done in addition to scheduling an appointment for the next day, according to Stoddard-Gunn.
Creating the behavioral health center in Cambridge was not without its challenges. Taglieri said the health care workforce was “severely depleted over the course of the pandemic,” resulting in a need to hire more staff.
“We actually ended up doing quite well — we still have some open positions that we may be using temporary behavioral health staff,” Taglieri said. “In spite of the challenges, I think we’ve been able to get the staff with the qualifications needed.”
According to Stoddard-Gunn, three therapists, a full-time psychiatric registered nurse, and front desk staff have recently joined CHA’s team, with plans to onboard a part-time psychiatrist, a recovery coach, and peer specialists within the coming months.
Taglieri said she expects it will take roughly one or two years for the CBHC at the Cambridge Health Alliance to be fully operational. She added that the CBHCs are designed for those who “don't automatically know what to do” when confronted with a behavioral health problem.
“Most people, if they have a medical, they have a pretty good idea of their choices — then you can go to an ED, call your doctor, or even now go to an urgent care center — but that’s not the same for behavioral health,” Taglieri said. “A big part of this initiative is to change that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Boston Mayor Michelle Wu ’07 announced the 10 members of the newly-formed Reparations Task Force to “study the lasting impacts of slavery in Boston,” according to a Feb. 7 press release.
In February 2022, Boston City Councilor Julia Mejia proposed the establishment of a commission to study reparations for Boston’s Black residents, which was unanimously approved by the Boston City Council ten months later. The ordinance cites the city’s role in the African slave trade and its discriminatory policies following abolition, which range from segregated public housing to racist “red-lining” zoning practices.
The task force will be chaired by Joseph D. Feaster Jr., former president of the Boston branch of the NAACP.
“I’m glad to see that the Boston City Council took the initiative to address the issue,” Feaster said in an interview. “I’m honored and humbled to have been asked to serve on a reparation task force and in fact chair it, and so I understand my mission, and I plan to execute.”
The task force is preparing to begin the first phase of its work, which will focus on researching the city’s role in the African slave trade and ties to the institution of slavery, per the ordinance.
Feaster said the task force’s research would need to decide the scope and time frame at which it will examine reparations in Boston.
“Do you look at slavery as it was applied from the moment that folks were taken from the shores of Africa and arrived here in Virginia?” Feaster asked. “Do you look at it from the standpoint of persons who came to Massachusetts, and more specifically to Boston as slaves or freedmen, and were still enslaved in some way?”
In the second phase of the task force’s work, set to begin this summer, members plan to review the city’s previous efforts to address the “continued impacts of enslavement,” according to the ordinance.
Linda J. Bilmes ’80, a senior lecturer at Harvard Kennedy School, said in an interview that the concept of reparations has ample precedent in the United States.
“Reparations are very commonplace for many, many different types of harms, and the U.S. government pays what we call the reparatory compensation every day,” Bilmes said.
Bilmes added, however, that the U.S. “rarely has done more than providing financial compensation,” referencing payments of up to $100,000 to the victims of mid-20th century nuclear weapons tests, which exposed tens of thousands of people to dangerous radiation.
Feaster said one difficulty for the task force will be deciding the most appropriate method of reparations for slavery, given the wide variety of perspectives among advocates for reparations.
“If you speak to 10 people, you’re gonna get 10 different answers,” Feaster said. “Some people want, ‘Give me the money, I should be paid,’ and there are others that say, ‘Put it into housing. Put it into health issues.’”
The task force will provide their answer to that question in a final report proposing recommendations for “truth, reconciliation, and reparations” for Boston in June 2024, concluding the final phase of the initiative.
The move brings Boston into a wider national movement for local reparations, following the 2021 approval for compensations to Black residents of Evanston, Illinois, harmed by the city’s discriminatory housing policies.
Two years ago, Cambridge began looking into reparations through a proposed pilot program that would directly provide money to residents from cannabis sales revenue.
Despite longstanding efforts from advocates, Congress has yet to pass H.R. 40, a 30-year-old bill to establish a federal commission which would “study the legacy of slavery in the United States and its ongoing harm and develop proposals for redress and repair, including reparations.”
Bilmes said she believes any reparations for the harms of slavery and its effects would be incomplete without federal action.
“The scale of the problem far exceeds the ability of local governments, in my view, to address the fundamental wealth equality gap,” Bilmes said. “I don’t think that there will be a fundamental improvement in people’s lives without a federal reparations program.”
In the press release, Wu said she sees the task as part of a broader movement to promote racial justice.
“Our administration remains committed to tackling long standing racial inequities and this task force is the next step in our commitment as a city to advance racial justice and build a Boston for everyone,” Wu said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard men’s basketball kept its Ivy Madness tournament hopes alive this weekend. After suffering four consecutive losses, the Crimson (14-12, 5-7 Ivy) needed a pair of wins against already playoff-eliminated Columbia (7-20, 2-10 Ivy) and fourth-place Cornell (16-9, 6-6 Ivy) to remain in contention for the postseason.
A strong offensive performance boosted Harvard past Columbia, 83-65, before the Crimson traveled upstate to take on Cornell. Exceptional defense and a standout, career-best scoring performance from senior forward Chris Ledlum gave the Crimson their second win of the weekend.
Harvard’s efforts saw Ledlum and first-year forward Chisom Okpara take home the player and rookie of the week awards, respectively.
HARVARD PASSES COLUMBIA TEST, 83-65
A Friday night game under the lights in New York City set the stage for what appeared to be a pivotal point in Harvard’s season. Columbia were determined to avoid a tenth consecutive defeat and played with intent from the tip-off.
Competition proved fierce in the first-half. Ten minutes into the game, the score sat level, with no more than a point separating the two teams. However, as play went on, the Crimson started to pull away. One of the key differences separating the two teams was rebounding ability.
Throughout the game, Harvard out rebounded Columbia 52-26, creating opportunities for itself on both ends of the court. By tripling the Lion’s offensive rebound numbers (18-6), the Crimson were able to score an impressive 17 second-chance points, in sharp contrast to Columbia’s four.
Lions head coach Jim Engles reflected on the deficit after the game, identifying it as one of the faults behind its ten game losing streak (which Columbia snapped Saturday with a 71-65 win over Dartmouth (9-17, 5-7 Ivy)).
"It's what we've been focusing on," Engles said. “When we don't rebound, we put ourselves in a bad spot. I thought we defended well on the first shots, but on the second shots not as much."
Harvard took a well-earned 46-38 advantage into halftime and came back out onto the court looking composed and ready to stick to their game. Responding to a quick Columbia basket, the Crimson scored nine unanswered points to secure a 15 point advantage early in the second half.
From that point on, Harvard’s offense proved too much for the Lions to handle. Led by 16 points from Okpara and 15 from Ledlum, the Crimson maintained a comfortable lead throughout the second half, going ahead by as many as 21 points with 1:30 left to play.
All in all, four Harvard players scored in double figures, with senior guard Idan Tretout adding 13 points and junior forward Justice Ajogbor contributing another 14.
HARVARD TAKES DOWN CORNELL, 73-56
The last time Harvard and Cornell met, the Crimson went toe-to-toe with the Big Red offensively, eventually pulling away late for an emphatic 95-89 victory at Lavietes Pavilion.
Since then, Cornell has continued to be an offensive powerhouse, entering Saturday’s game as one of the most dominant offensive teams in the nation, averaging 84.4 points per game so far this season.
This time around, Harvard adopted a different approach, limiting Cornell to a season-low 56 points in a performance that showcased both tough defense and efficient offensive shooting.
The difference between the two teams on Saturday night was apparent to anyone who watched the game. Ledlum scored a career high 35 points in addition to 13 rebounds and six steals in a display that made clear why Ledlum is widely considered one of the best players in the Ivy League.
Through 26 games this season, Ledlum sits second in the league in total points, rebounding, and steals per game. Harvard head coach Tommy Amaker has continuously praised Ledlum's ability and the critical role he has played on the court this season.
“Ledlum, obviously, he’s our best player,” Amaker said earlier this season. “He’s the guy that we have to play through and put things on his shoulders and he’s able to deliver.”
After breaking a four-game losing streak against Columbia the night prior, the Crimson’s shooting in the first-half reflected a renewed confidence, as Harvard shot 60% from the field in the first half.
That efficiency saw the Crimson pull ahead by as many as 15 points in the first 15 minutes of action, before a 13-4 Big Red run to close out the half brought Cornell within six points and a 40-34 scoreline with everything to play for in the second half.
Harvard’s hot start cooled slightly in the second half, as the Crimson shot an uninspired 40% from the field. However, it mattered little, as Harvard’s defense was able to limit Cornell to a horrific 5-for-23 (21.7%) on field goals and 2-for-11 (18.2%) from three point range.
Without its typical ability to generate offense and knock down shots, the Big Red slumped into a double-digit deficit with 16:11 left and never came within fewer than ten points of the Crimson, who closed out the game 17 points clear of Cornell.
In addition to Ledlum’s impressive point total, Tretout also posted 19 points and three assists, continuing a season of consistent offensive contributions. In his past ten games, Tretout has only failed to hit double-digits once.
Despite the much-needed victories, Harvard still sits one-game behind both Cornell and Brown in what is emerging as a three-way duel for the fourth and final tournament spot.
Next up for the Crimson is a showdown with rival Princeton, which currently sits in a three-way tie for first place. The matchup, this Saturday the 25th at 2:00 pm, will be Harvard’s final home game of the season before one final road game against Dartmouth on March 4th.

 Word on the street is that some of you freshmen are making Google forms and waitlists for your blocking groups. When I heard that, I was at a loss for words. I feel it is my personal responsibility to set your generation (I refer, of course, to everyone in the Class of 2026, most of whom are about six months younger than me) on the right path. So, here are some ways to decide about who to block with that don’t involve begging your ‘friends’ to let you live with them or telling people What Father Does For Work.
Choose Based on Freshman Dorm
Take it from a Class of ’25er — you do NOT want to be spending Housing Day in a dorm on Prescott Street. Yeah, your friends might all live in Pennypacker, but you want a straight view to the statue the morning of. Find somebody in a dorm with a good view and block with them for the ideal Housing Day experience. Matthews has a pretty ideal location, but you’ve got to make sure their window faces into the Old Yard. It’s also nice to hide out in a separate entryway dorm, like Grays or Hollis, so you don’t have to have a heart attack every time a group of upperclassmen stampedes up the stairs.
Block with Your Pset Group
You guys are probably sick and tired of the first floor of Cabot Library, right? What if I told you there was a surefire way that you could all swipe into the same house library next year? Or better yet, share the same common room? Work-life balance… who’s that? It’s much better to be able to beg your classmate for the answers from the comfort of your own complimentary pleather couch.
Pick Based on Shirt/Shoe Size
There must be somebody on this campus who shares your exact measurements. If you room together, you’ll get double the wardrobe! No more wondering what to wear to the party/interview/blind date/office hours with the hot TF. You’ll never have to go shopping again!
Block with the Busiest Person You Know
Most sophomores have to live in doubles. But it’s basically not a double if you never see your roommate. You don’t even have to sexile them if they’re always in the library or at some kind of meeting. And, obviously, they won’t be sexiling you anytime soon. The toughest part about this one is holding a conversation with them for long enough to get them to agree to block with you. Steal their phone and put a meeting in their GCal. They’ll be there. They won’t know why, but they’ll be there.
Kidnap Somebody from Annenberg
Find someone sitting alone with headphones on and chloroform them when they open their mouth to take a bite of delicious New HUDS. Drag them to the basement of Memorial Hall — nobody’s ever down there. When they come to, say, “We can do this the easy way,” open your laptop to the blocking form, “or we can do this the hard way.” They’ll be oh-so-happy to block with you! Or, you know, you could ask them.
Block with Your Bestie — Yourself
You know what? You’re in your pset group. You share your exact measurements. You’re even probably pretty busy! Yeah, you’ll always be in your room when you’re there, and that’s kind of annoying. But ultimately, being a ‘floater’ is always an option, and not at all a bad one. Do you even want to room with any of your friends, anyway? They seem pretty messy to me.
Guys, blocking is just not that deep. Yes, I have friends in my house. Yes, I blocked with a couple of them, one of whom is my roommate (and who also fits a couple of the above criteria — shoutout to Roxy!). But most of them were just assigned to the house too! Pure serendipity! And I see my non-blocking-group friends all the time, too, because at the end of the day, we all live on the same square mile anyway. Best of luck on Housing Day, and remember, don’t stress yourself out about something that truly does not matter that much!
