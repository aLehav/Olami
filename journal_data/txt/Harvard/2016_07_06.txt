After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Steve Altes’ “Geeks and Greeks,” a graphic novel about MIT’s hacking and pranking culture, at first seems like a promising foray into one of the most mythologized college campuses. The novel’s fresh format is a relief from the typical “tell-all tales” that saturate the Ivy League+2 literature market—but it remains marketed to infatuated outsiders looking in, as evidenced by the scenic photos and explanatory blurbs on its website. It also reverts to the classic “buff jocks and skinny academics” dichotomy, imagining the highest echelons of academia as a reiteration of high school lives and distilling the complicated world of MIT into the most readily available social archetype. Bad anthropology, to be sure, but even worse writing.
In one scene, a geek named Dexter is forced to do the jocks’ homework. Desperately sleep deprived, he laments that his “happiness is on a downward vector.” [He doesn’t need to speak like this to convey his geekiness, and this awkward moment demonstrates Altes’s difficulty adjusting to the medium of the graphic novel. He uses words to characterise the novel’s main players, forgetting that he operates within the domain of the image. In graphic novels, the immediate role of the writer is not necessarily to create dialogue but rather to create plot, and in this regard Altes is less than stellar. The overarching conflict of academics and athletes seems forced, and its accoutrements, such as the “dice of doom” (a twelve-sided die that dictates the punishments for the Greeks’ victims), are not quite captivating. Where Altes could have capitalized on the fluidity of his medium to render a compelling and unique plot—a portrait of a school—he instead fills in the backstories of some of MIT’s most famous hacks. Altes is encumbered by his journalistic past: A novel does not need to be factual to be true, and he would do well to eschew the scaffold of MIT hacks for something more socially nuanced.
The artist, Andy Fish, does no better in his attempts to characterize MIT, and except for the occasional panoramic view of an MIT landmark, there is nothing to distinguish the setting from any other college campus—or even from that of any high school. Fish’s particular style (his work includes superhero comic books as well as more eclectic offerings such as “Werewolves of Wisconsin”) barely makes a cameo in “Geeks and Greeks.” Instead, Fish tries to conjure up an almost bucolic environment of collegiate drama. While he excels in the novel’s scenic shots, Fish has little material to elaborate on when it comes to the dialogue-laden parts. The thinness of the characters offers little to work with, meaning that every frat boy is virtually indistinguishable from the rest.
Colorist Veronica Fish’s work proves likewise mixed in its success. Fish created the commercial art for the CW reimagining of Archie, in addition to drawing two issues of the classic series, and while her captivating pop-art kitsch style is remarkably versatile, its genius is not apparent in this series. Instead of making use of her normally well-curated color palettes (most apparent in her magnet designs), Veronica Fish goes confusingly garish in the first few strips, relying on utopian greens and optic blues. To her credit, a furtive hacking mission is beautifully colored with deep purples and pastel yellows—the colors of mystery, but also of untapped artistic talent.
Overall, “Geeks and Greeks” begins with a promising premise that is ultimately ill-conveyed. The writer’s lack of familiarity with the medium lays out a poor canvas upon which the visual artists struggle to work. While “Geeks and Greeks” is meant to be something of a genre hack, its ill execution leaves tangible disappointment in its wake. For now, MIT’s story can best be understood via a visit to its campus.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’d never been one of those yellow boys who collected ill sneakers and smoked weed and tried to live a funky hip-hop inspired life despite being suburban as hell, but I knew them growing up. They were juxtaposed against kids in solid button-downs and Science Olympiad t-shirts. Their counterparts were girls like me, who’d also listened to the Fugees in middle school and tried really hard to make slang fit pretty in a sentence. At one point a friend asked me what was it with Asians and hip-hop, and I said something about simple good music, which I knew was insufficient.
What I couldn’t verbalize then: the yellow connection with hip-hop never felt skin thin because it was swarming. It was everywhere, not just my pretty New Jersey town with the handful of boys I knew in a nice 2010 moment where every other song playing on the radio was Eminem. By the time I left Jersey five years later, I’d accumulated ten dollars in high school library fines for Jeff Chang’s Who We Be. Eddie Huang became every yellow kid’s favorite thought experiment, and Jin got mad Pentecostal with his rap. Dumbfoundead said that the maleness of hip-hop could counteract yellow emasculation, and the guy I was seeing listened to Nas a lot so maybe he was a little sensitive. Everyone tried to own rap even if they couldn’t, the yellow people and the white people, the rich-kid suburbanites and the good-boy nerds, which made rap some of the most seductive music out there. And everyone said they related to it because it was outsider music, which made me wonder if anyone could really be on the inside.
Mostly I wanted to know why I, female and suburban and upper-middle-class and daughter-of-professors and yellow-not-black, wanted to claim it too. After my roommate told me I had the music taste of her father, I decided to switch up the songs. I started falling in love with Tyler the Creator, no sweat. He was fantastic because he was colorful and awkward and intentional and decidedly, self-consciously unsexy. Some time in April we were listening to Goblin, and I realized I didn’t love Tyler the Creator in spite of the fact he talked about rape and cunts and faggots every other sentence but, maybe, because of it. He used misogyny as an aesthetic the way society did. He didn’t try to delude himself about inhabiting a world that he didn’t believe existed. His persona didn’t pretend to be happy or sane. He made machismo and misogyny and homophobia look like weak defenses against the pathetic outline of himself.
During finals period last semester, my roommate got me dead-fish hooked on HBO’s Girls like the artsy, social-justicey, slightly-feministy college kid I was supposed to be. The scene was picturesque because May was finally getting pretty and through the Matthews window you could see this yellow girl from Jersey sitting next to this black girl from Queens, and the two laughing at a group of four dumb sad self-concerned white girls on an oversized computer screen. I kept thinking about the discourse and fanfare about the show. I flirted with the idea that maybe Lena Dunham actually meant to talk about white privilege/self-entitlement/behavior by displaying it all so grossly. Regardless, my roommate and I were too colored to get the social commentary so we laughed at the unbeautiful, undesirable, broken, reasonless, repulsive white girls onscreen and thought that maybe we were getting at a white girl’s interiority. The girls’ pain was so loud it felt fake, like Taylor Swift songs and Tumblr. I wasn’t used to a hurt that dissolved, motionless. The hurt I knew about was so busy you could barely see it through the music.
Before, I had never seen a femininity that was so eager to claim victim. Female was my mother when she first came here, straight-from-China and pregnant and a grad student, with only $64 in her pocket. Female was Tinashe making thugs cry and Rihanna telling you to homicide it, but it wasn’t just sex and badassery, because the femininity I knew centered around an assumption that was by nature colored. It was outlined by Ntozake Shange, when she wrote “i cdnt stand bein sorry & colored at the same time / it’s so redundant in the modern world.” Female was Afeni Shakur saying she was just one of many black mothers who’d lost their sons, even if her son was Tupac. Femininity was a play, a tug, a performance. Our femaleness presented itself as an intertwining, inseparable cruel and vulnerable. Colored girls were cruel because we were vulnerable, vulnerable because we were cruel. It was part of our aesthetic.
But more, it was part of our survival. Our brand of femininity was historical, based on the castration of our families during slavery, our importations as picture brides or whores, our occupations while our men were imprisoned. Our type was personal, found in the way I was raised to build, not maintain, my legacy in this country. Our style was tangible when we described libido over romance, bodies over love, because it was nobler to push ourselves down than to let someone else do it. Loving hip-hop was listening, but more—loving hip-hop was learning to survive a femaleness that was colored and therefore cruel, even when it was obvious our male counterparts were not surviving. Loving hip-hop was an effort to be fresh and un-redundant, because we were taught to be this hard, meant to be this hard. Loving hip-hop was supposed to make this kid feel free.
Once, junior year, I sat in the cafeteria, thinking about 1997, which was the year I was born, but also the year when Tupac and Biggie were shot within six months of one another. I was wondering what that could do for a generation, whether it added wood or water to a fire. I wanted to write a poem about it but I thought I was too yellow to do it. Then two kids started a cypher in the middle of the cafeteria, yellow boys two years younger than me but in my precalc class, spitting things they probably spent hours preparing, which never happened and will probably never happen again. Other kids got up and applauded. I thought something I should have known before: it was possible to need something you didn’t make. You just had to figure out why.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BROOKLYN, New York—Things are slower on this side of the bridge; the walk back to the apartment is an unhurried one. The sun filters through the block’s trees and glints off the strung lights that hang outside the restaurant next door. Time itself moves slowly when everything is washed in gold like that.
It is not yet as hot as it will be, but the air still smells bodily sweet, like berries left too long in the sun. I breathe it in. I like very much the ease of the area, the relative solitude. In downtown Manhattan, where I work, the buildings disappear into clouds and businessmen run to get from place to place and you smell cigarettes and burnt oil, not overripe berries.
It is still noisy here, though, especially below the Marcy Ave stop, where the J train brings me home every night. I’ve come to know this as a simple fact of life in New York—there is sound, always. They do not stop, the sounds: the rhythmic hum of the printers in the office, the deliberate rattle of the train, the honks and the sirens and the indiscriminate shouts. One night, my eardrums grew weary searching for silence (the kind that’s so easy to find in California), so they’ve since stopped searching.
We are living in an artist’s very sparse, very white apartment for the month of June, until we move into a sublet down the block for July. The futon is frameless, and there’s a large green plant in the corner of the living room, and there are painters’ stools for chairs. It’s all we really need, so we love it.
We have no terrace, but there is a pale blue fire escape that looks into the apartments of a much nicer building across the street, one with terraces. Tonight I go out because the apartment is warm, and the fire escape’s metal is cool in the dark. I realize that though we’ve watched the sun set here many times, we’ve never watched the city go from day to night, not completely.
It’s nearly 9:30 p.m., and still the sun hasn’t died. I can see reddish orange hugging the Williamsburg Bridge and settling into the skyscrapers across the river. The rest of the sky is the color cobalt: simultaneously bold and bright, vast and empty.
Tonight I have the time, so I watch the cobalt inevitably falter, then go black. Lights twinkle over in Manhattan. For a moment, I think those lights must be illuminating the whole world, and I can believe why they say that New York City is the center of the universe. It is frightening how easy it was to be convinced of the necessity, the magic, of this place. I really do love its bright lights and ripe smells, even its sounds.
Still, I remember that somewhere west the sun has yet to set.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two days before the attack on Ataturk Airport, I helped move a Crimson Summer Academy Scholar into Matthews. As we climbed the stairs, panes of sun fell from the skylight, burnishing the wood paneling an otherworldly white. The Scholar’s father, like mine on freshman move-in day, couldn’t shutter a proud and nervous smile, and wouldn’t let me help carry the suitcase. The periwinkle of his mother’s hijab seemed to cool the stifling fifth-floor air. I wanted to go home and just sit at the dining table with my parents; or stay in those moments forever, listening to the hum and thud of furniture as the Scholar and his family unpacked, quietly giddy with the Yard’s magic.
In the evening, I strolled west. The sky over the Quad was oxidized pink, stretched over the rim of ringed buildings like a membranous water surface. Between Garden and Brattle streets, I rediscovered the house with the eggplant paint job, the color so sweet in the licorice dusk. I visited the Longfellow House—its slats the yellow of soft afternoon sleep, its garden an eighteenth-century idyll. Under the property floodlights’ low-angled glare, my feet on the gravel path looked as if they stood on the moon, attached to a creature removed and utterly inhuman.
#
After Ataturk—and then Dhaka, and then Baghdad—I truly, viscerally registered the hanging sword of potential disaster. The possibility that I may one day walk into a public space and never return. I watched Fourth of July fireworks on a crowded bridge over the Charles, and couldn't stop wondering, amidst the wonder of a combusting sky, whether a burst of fire or lead would suddenly drown out the distant pop of tame pyrotechnics.
I’m not sure why the tipping point required so many horrific attacks and deaths. Living with such little consciousness of danger has been an incredible luxury, and in this retrospect, everything looks surreal. I don’t even see so much as feel every perishable particle, a rich thrum beneath the sternum. What beautiful days and nights. I understand why you would resent and hate those of us who can live like this.
And why, why do I deserve such hyper-enjoyment, such a benefit-reaping, low-stake life, in the wake—and really, at the expense—of such tragedy?
I know this question is neither groundbreaking nor redeeming. I know it's self-absorbed. I know there are lifetimes of thought about guilt, karmic imbalances, the worth or lack thereof in this kind of irresolvable questioning. Right now, I can find only incredible damnation in these thoughts, and their lateness. My penning them makes nothing better, but I feel as if it’s the least I can do as others’ worlds fall apart.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard musicians will soon be able to boast attending both the school that educated Yo-Yo Ma, and the institution that taught the likes of John Mayer and band members from Imagine Dragons.
Harvard College and Berklee College of Music have formalized a new dual-degree program, marking the beginning of a partnership that promises to marry Harvard’s liberal arts curriculum with a more focused, advanced degree in music from Berklee. By the end of the program’s five-year cycle, students will have earned a Bachelor of Arts from Harvard and either a Master of Arts or a Master of Music from Berklee. 
“Imagine the possibilities when a world-leading Harvard undergraduate education can be augmented by private lessons, ensembles, and music classes in jazz, production, film scoring and more at Berklee,” Berklee President Roger H. Brown said in a press release.
The program will begin accepting applications on Tuesday and will start, officially, in Fall 2017. In the interim, both institutions will have information on their websites for prospective students with the specifics of the program, which will require students to complete curriculums from both schools.
Interested students will have to apply and receive admissions to both institutions separately, as well as complete an additional audition and interview with Berklee. Current Harvard undergraduates in their freshman or sophomore years can also apply to transfer into the program.
In addition to completing course requirements for Harvard’s undergraduate curriculum during the first three years of the program, students will take private and preparatory lessons at Berklee. Once earning a Harvard bachelor’s degree in the fourth year of the program, students will spend another year full-time at Berklee to complete the rest of the requirements for an advanced master's degree.
The program mirrors closely an already-existing partnership between Harvard and the New England Conservatory, which follows a similar five-year plan of study.
Currently, the Harvard and Berklee music programs diverge somewhat in their content. While Harvard’s program deals heavily with theory, composition, and music in the context of culture and history, Berklee’s program focuses on the practical applications of the art in film, television, global entertainment, and contemporary performance, among other things. The program will merge the separate tracks to provide students with a fuller experience.
“Institutionally, the partnership represents an understanding of the arts and art-making in the 21st century, especially the growing impact of technology and the realities of a globalizing arts landscape,” chair of Harvard’s music department Carol J. Oja said in a press release.
Though largely supported by faculty in Harvard’s music department, the proposal for the joint-degree program came under fire earlier this year when several faculty members raised concerns about financial costs. The program, they said, had the potential to incur thousands of additional dollars in costs for students seeking the dual degree—a bill that they believed Harvard was unlikely to foot for students who receive financial aid.
Psychology professor Jason P. Mitchell, a member of the Faculty Council—the highest elected body in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences—voted against the program earlier in February and criticized it for being at odds with Harvard’s mission of providing opportunities to students regardless of their socioeconomic backgrounds. At the meeting, he cautioned faculty members against turning art and music into disciplines exclusively available to wealthier students.
“It seems to us as though it’s walking back from that commitment to now create new programs that will effectively be only open to students with the financial means to pay for them,” he said in February.
Faculty within the music department who supported the program argued that it should be considered independently of its expenses. The Harvard-Berklee program would cost students upwards of $8,000 per year—the same expense of the Harvard-New England Conservatory program, according to Oja, with the exception of the program’s global jazz track, which will be fully funded.
Since then, an endowed scholarship fund has been established by a member of Berklee’s Presidential Advisory Council to provide financial aid for students accepted to the joint-degree program with demonstrated need. It is unclear whether similar funds will be made available through Harvard’s financial aid office.

Harvard has graduated more students who went on to become Fortune 500 CEOs than any other university, beating out other top schools including Stanford and MIT. Cue the renewed snark towards Stanford followed by an ego-boost.
According to Money Magazine, which analyzed CEO alma maters using the S&P Global Market Intelligence database, ten current Fortune 500 CEOs graduated from Harvard College, more than any other undergraduate college.
Lloyd C. Blankfein ’75, CEO of Goldman Sachs, earned an A.B. in history from Harvard College and later a J.D. from Harvard Law School. This just goes to show if you are a confused history major struggling to find what you are going to do once you leave college, don’t rule out becoming a Fortune 500 CEO just yet.
Unfortunately, this number doesn't count Mark Zuckerberg, who founded Facebook in his Harvard dorm room but dropped out to work on his little startup.
Even more impressive, Harvard Business School educated 28 of the current Fortune 500 CEOs—nearly three time as the next highest graduate business programs, Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and Stanford Graduate School of Business. The likes of Jeffrey R. Immelt of General Electric and Jamie Dimon of J.P. Morgan Chase prepared to become business titans at HBS.
