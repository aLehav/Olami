After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Plaintiffs in the social group lawsuits rejected Harvard’s Feb. 8 motions to dismiss their state and federal complaints and asserted the legal merits of their arguments in Friday court filings.
The plaintiffs argued in the federal filing that the University’s sanctions against members of certain single-gender social organizations is illegal under Title IX, a federal law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex, because it discriminates against both men and women. The University has previously contended that the penalties against single-gender social organizations affect men and women equally.
“The policy punishes a male student in a men’s club based solely on his sex and the sex of the members of his club. It also punishes a female student in a women’s club based solely on her sex and the sex of the members of her club,” the federal filing reads. “That is sex discrimination against both students, not neither of them.”
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane rebuffed the discrimination allegations in an emailed statement that referenced the University’s motions to dismiss the lawsuits.
“Harvard College’s policy on unrecognized single-gender social organizations does not discriminate against any undergraduate student and is a measured and lawful policy that treats all students equally,” she wrote.
The filings are the most recent developments in a pair of parallel lawsuits — filed in December 2018 — that accuse Harvard of infringing upon students’ freedom of association and unconstitutionally discriminating on the basis of sex. The College’s controversial social group sanctions, which debuted in May 2016 and took effect beginning with the Class of 2021, prohibit members of single-gender social clubs from receiving Harvard endorsement for prestigious fellowships like the Rhodes, and from holding sports captaincies and leadership positions in extracurricular campus organizations.
Plaintiffs in the federal suit include parent groups for fraternities Sigma Chi and Sigma Alpha Epsilon, international organizations for sororities Kappa Kappa Gamma and Kappa Alpha Theta, Harvard’s chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, and three current Harvard students who belong to all-male social groups and have chosen to remain anonymous. The international parent organization and newly reinstated Harvard chapter of Alpha Phi, along with a Delta Gamma management corporation, are plaintiffs in the Massachusetts state case.
Early last month, Harvard’s lawyers argued that judges should reject the lawsuits on the grounds that even if the plaintiffs’ factual claims are true, they do not show that the sanctions policies are discriminatory. They rebuffed claims that the rules limit freedom of association or otherwise disadvantage students of either sex.
Harvard also alleged that some of the plaintiffs do not have standing to bring the suits because the national and international Greek organizations are accusing the University of discrimination on behalf of their members. Moreover, since the third anonymous student plaintiff, John Doe 3, is an upperclassman who is not subject to the social group penalties, Harvard’s lawyers contended that he, too, does not have legal standing.
Attorneys for the plaintiffs disagreed, asserting that they do in fact have standing. They said that the sanctions have impeded the mission of sorority parent organizations and have caused John Doe 3 “psychic and reputational harm,” qualifying the parties to bring the suits.
“But even one plaintiff’s standing is enough to establish this Court’s jurisdiction, and Harvard does not dispute that two plaintiffs— John Doe 1 and John Doe 2—have standing,” the plaintiffs’ federal filing reads.
Harvard will have until April 19 to respond to both the state and federal filings . After receiving Harvard’s response, the federal district court will either issue a decision or call a hearing on Harvard’s motion to dismiss.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After suffering a deflating 91-62 defeat to Penn in the Ivy tournament semifinals, Harvard women’s basketball was at perhaps its lowest point of the season. Frustrated and heartbroken to see its hopes at an Ivy League championship crumble, the Crimson nevertheless had to continue to chug on and prepare for WNIT postseason play.
In doing so, Coach Delaney-Smith employed a different practice plan. Rather than run through sets or drills, she simply let her team play.
“This past week we just focused on getting back to having fun and enjoying playing basketball,” said junior guard Katie Benzan, “So the first two practices, we just scrimmaged. Literally, [we] just ran up and down, music was playing, coaches didn’t even coach. It was just basically pickup, like in the fall [and] in the spring. And it was just good to get up and down, to laugh, to find that joy.”
Harvard’s renewed confidence showed immediately in Friday night’s first-round win over Drexel, as it accelerated to a 20-point first quarter to complete a wire-to-wire, 69-56 victory. The bounce-back result means that the Crimson will play at least one more game at Lavietes Pavilion, challenging Georgetown on Sunday at 3PM.
After shooting just 27.3 percent from deep against the Quakers, Harvard returned back to its regular form, knocking down 10 triples across 21 attempts. This came even against a Dragons team that held the top scoring defense in the nation. Conceding just 49.9 points per game prior to its bout with the Crimson, Drexel also saw its season-long streak of holding opponents to under 60 points in regulation end on Saturday.
“I’m really proud of everybody, my staff and my players for putting on their big girl pants and working really hard all week,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “They did a really, really good job. They don’t have their spring break, no one’s here. What keeps you going is postseason and March Madness, so I’m very proud of this group.”
Harvard showed its fighting spirit across various metrics, including out-rebounding the Dragons 42-31 and tallying 26 points in the paint. Hitting a total of eight triples in the first half — four of which came from the fingertips of Benzan — the Crimson offense flowed from all cylinders in the early onset. A three from senior Madeline Raster pushed Harvard to a 25-17 lead to kick off the second quarter, and two more triples from classmate Sydney Skinner and Benzan widened the margin to double figures entering halftime.
“It gives us a boost in our confidence, in our intensity and our energy,” said Benzan’s of the team’s scoring success in the beginning of the contest, “Sometimes Kathy [Delaney-Smith] gets on us to keep that same intensity and energy, especially when our shots aren’t falling. So tonight when they were going down easy...that was a great start.”
Harvard also held Drexel’s leading scorer Bailey Greenberg to just two points entering halftime intermission, while counterpart Niki Metzel was held scoreless in the first two stanzas. The Dragons shot just 3-of-14 in the second quarter, with only one player in double figures at that point.
“We also emphasize defense and rebounding,” senior Nani Redford said. “So as far as just making sure that we are grabbing boards so that we can help us to translate on the other end. I felt we just played our game like we wanted to play and that was definitely helpful for us.”
Sophomore forward Jadyn Bush had a comeback performance of her own, earning a double-double with 12 points and 13 boards. The Federal Way, Wash., native made her mark against a scrappy Dragons team, one that committed 16 personal fouls on the night. The Crimson was near-perfect at the line, shooting 90 percent.
The host side’s streaky shooting settled down in the third quarter, but not before Redford added two triples of her own. However, right when that early push seemed to suggest the Crimson could pull away, the Dragons embarked on a 13-2 rally to bring the score back a one-possession contest with four to play in the third quarter.
This time, it would be aggressiveness inside that helped the Crimson re-claim a more comfortable lead, as lay-ups from junior Jeannie Boehm, Skinner, and Bush to start the final quarter put Harvard back in front by 10.
This formula of attacking the basket was critical to make-up for a suddenly-cold 2-for-9 mark from beyond the arc in the second half. The Crimson matched every late effort by the Dragons to draw it close, and finished the win in front of an energetic home crowd.
“I thought we worked really hard on defense,” Delaney-Smith said. “Their system, it comes from Villanova. It’s like this five out, motion. They are very well-coached and they know how to read each other, slip screens, and read you when you turn your head. With a few exceptions, we did not get burnt. We took that away, and I would credit our defense.”
Four Crimson players finished in double-digits, led by Benzan’s 18 points. On the opposite side, Greenberg was held to eight points while Aubree Brown picked up some slack with 16 to her name.
This win marks the fifth time in program history that Harvard will advance to the second round, and the first WNIT game it has hosted at Lavietes Pavilion. The Sunday afternoon matchup with the Hoyas puts the Crimson in a position to face Penn for the fourth time this season. If both the Crimson and Quakers can pull their weight, Round Three of the NIT will undoubedtly be a must-watch revenge game.
But for now, it is a much happier locker-room for Delaney-Smith’s side and another opportunity to play basketball at home for the seniors.
“I’ve just never thought I’d play here again,” Redford said. “So this was just nice to come back and play this game.”
