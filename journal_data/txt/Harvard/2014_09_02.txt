After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though people toast champagne and sing and watch the ball drop in Times Square to ring in January 1, to me the New Year happens nine months later—the start of the school year. Bubbling excitement replaces bubbling beverages, back-to-school styles replace winter coats and scarves, and New School Year resolutions carry more weight than the calendar-year variety. For example, this will be the year that I work out regularly, read for fun nightly, and begin assignments well before their due dates (cue hearty guffaw).
I’m not alone. Many of us begin every school year with solemn oaths to be more productive. We swear to ourselves that we will go to the gym, practice an instrument, or code outside of class. We tell ourselves that we’ll be organized and committed to this new mantra of efficiency and productivity. Inevitably, however, we get lost in the chaos of a semester at Harvard. Control dances frustratingly, tantalizingly, just out of our reach. Some of us do not recognize the almost comic futility of a New School Year resolution. We tell ourselves, “This year will be different!” Then, a few weeks later, we fall off the wagon.
Part of the problem, I have realized, is also what gives Harvard its impressive standing among academic institutions worldwide: Harvard provides us with boundless extracurricular opportunities. Nobel Laureates frequently give special lectures on cutting-edge research. Students can choose from 455 clubs covering a broad spectrum of interests, from political to musical to downright whimsical. Perhaps most important and engaging, as most Harvard undergraduates will attest, are our fellow classmates.
Granted, famous lecturers, a cornucopia of clubs, and a fulfilling group of friends are boons, not distractions. But maximizing the value of our education requires that we strike an equilibrium between Harvard’s abundance of opportunities and personal development. So how do we have our cake and eat it too?
We find the balance we need by making decisive and incisive use of our time. We should minimize wasted time spent wringing our hands over pending assignments (distinct from downtime, a healthy part of any schedule). We should transform inefficient time into productive, fruitful time.
As for me, I have resolved to spend the half-hour in between loads of laundry jogging along the Charles instead of taking half-hearted attempts at a math problem before being interrupted by my 33-minute timer. I will also carve out 20 minutes at the end of my night to read. I’ll learn, but I’ll also relax. Though these changes may be small on the surface, I think they’ll go a long way toward improving my self-esteem and attitude.
My peers might scoff, unconvinced of my being able to follow through on these commitments throughout the semester. Perhaps they are right. But I have come to realize the value of pre-semester goals is not merely in their completion; merely setting them forces me to reflect on my shortcomings and strengths, and then to develop strategies to address them.
Every year, we make promises to ourselves, resolving to be more productive, more proactive, more purposeful. Though we may not meet these goals, their importance as a means of self-assessment and self-awareness is paramount. It is the optimism inherent in these resolutions that drives us to improve and work towards becoming better people. After all, what kind of resolution is deciding to remain stagnant from school year to school year?
So this year, I resolve to exercise. I resolve to read for pleasure. I resolve to work on assignments throughout the week, and create and maintain an organized calendar. This time, I will follow through. This time, it really is different.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Approximately two times a week in the United States, between 2006 and 2012, a white police officer killed a black person.
On August 9, it happened again. That day, Ferguson, Mo., police officer Darren Wilson shot and killed Michael Brown, an 18-year-old, unarmed black teenager, as he was walking home from a convenience store with a friend. According to a private autopsy report commissioned by the family, Brown was shot four times in his right arm and twice in the head.
None of those shots appear to have been taken at close range.
Brown’s body was left in the street, uncovered, for four hours, reminiscent of the days when black men and women were lynched and left hanging—a signal to the rest of the community to stay in line and remain conscious of their oppression. Witnesses have reported that Brown’s hands were in the air, and that Brown was unarmed, at the time he was killed.
As of yet, Officer Wilson’s police department and friends of the officer are the only individuals who have challenged this narrative given by several eyewitnesses. They claim Brown was aggressive and reaching for the officer’s gun. Following his death, community members have had to defend Brown to the public as a nice, black teenager, and not a dangerous black thug; that he was fully human and whole, and not three-fifths of a person; that he was somebody’s son, brother, and nephew, despite how anonymously black he may have appeared to Wilson.
But the Ferguson Police Department was not going to stand by as Brown’s achievements and humanity dominated reports of the shooting. On the same day he released Wilson’s name, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson released a video to reporters implicating Brown in a strong-arm robbery at a local convenience store just before his death. In the press conference, Chief Jackson claimed that the tape was released “because the press asked for it” and that the initial contact between Officer Wilson and Brown was not related to the robbery. Wilson was not aware of the robbery when he confronted Brown.
But in doing this, Chief Jackson minimized Brown’s position as the victim and distracted from his department’s failure to release a thorough police report connected to Brown’s shooting.
In this way, Brown was put on trial for his own death—Wilson supporters argued that Michael was a thief and an aggressor, while Brown’s community and family reminded the public that he was friendly, non-threatening, and college-bound to justify his right to life.
Though these traits and accomplishments have nothing to do with Brown’s humanity and his right to live, because he was a black man they seemed necessary for others to empathize with him as a victim. No person should have to rationalize his or her own right to live—whether rich or poor, white or black, college-bound or dropout.
Recognizing this, a few days after Michael Brown’s death, black Twitter users created the hashtag #IfTheyGunnedMeDown. Along with the hashtag, users typically uploaded two photos of themselves—one in which they appeared respectable, usually flaunting a ceremonial graduation robe or dressed for a professional occasion, and another in which they came across as what some would deem as thuggish or unclassy.
This Twitter campaign raised serious questions about how the media chooses to portray black victims, and particularly how they chose to portray Mike Brown following his death. The trend of dehumanizing and striking black victims of their innocence was evident in the media’s coverage of Trayvon Martin’s death just two years ago.
Because of this pattern, black youth question how the public measures their humanity. “What if I didn’t have a respectable photo to effectively cancel out my thug-esque photo, and which would the media use if I was gunned down in the streets?” “Do I need evidence of my success to justify my right to live?”
Unfortunately, based on recent cases, it appears that this evidence is a necessity. That there is a need for black people to display a degree of success before being deemed fully human in America is insulting and indicative of an extreme lack of progress.
However, even when this evidence of success is present, to some, black youth will never be deserving of sympathy or grief. Since Michael’s death, a “Support for Officer Wilson” Facebook page was created and supporters have rallied and gathered on Wilson’s behalf. The creators of the Facebook page also set up a GoFundMe account for Wilson, raising over $200,000. Donations for Wilson have surpassed donations for Brown’s family. These donations were often accompanied with racist and offensive remarks. One user wrote, “Thanks for taking out the trash”, with his $15 donation. Another person noted they would have donated more if Wilson had also shot the friend who was walking with Brown before Wilson killed him.
While a family and community are mourning the death of a young man, others sympathize with the killer and laud the death of the slain.
Unfortunately, this situation is not unfamiliar. The refusal to fully acknowledge black victimization is ever-present in our sociopolitical discourse. Consistently, black people are blamed for and told to take responsibility for their own poverty, poor education, and general oppression in the United States, an argument that altogether ignores the reality that there were never adequate programs and provisions to put blacks on equal footing as whites after slavery and Jim Crow.
Moreover, the continued refusal to criminalize white people for black death continues to suggest to black people that there will never be any justice for them in the United States. Officer Wilson will likely be absolved of wrongdoing, and substantive policy changes to prevent further shooting deaths of black youth will fall to the wayside.
Some detractors who speak out against protesters of the police’s handling of the Michael Brown case say that we should wait for the investigations (one by a grand jury and the other a federal civil case) to be completed.
In the United States, local law enforcement kills approximately 400 people per year. The majority of individuals targeted and killed in these altercations are minorities, and police are rarely indicted or convicted in the following investigations. Despite this pervasive use of deadly force in the line of duty, little has been done. Darren Wilson will likely walk free, and attempts to prevent future cases of deadly force will continue to be ineffective.
This denial of white criminality and black victimization, unless the black person displays some tint of exceptionalism, places black people in a double bind—they are told that they have to be successful in order to be deemed fully human but often aren’t given the resources they need to accomplish this success.
You can’t pull yourself up by your bootstraps if you never had shoes to begin with.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After demonstrations on campus and promises by University President Drew G. Faust, Harvard University finally has a centralized sexual assault policy. For the first time, the standard of evidence in disciplinary cases involving sexual assault is “a preponderance of evidence,” rather than the previous, vague guideline that required Administrative Board to be “sufficiently persuaded” of guilt.
Changing the evidentiary standard has previously been a roadblock to action because of misplaced concerns that it could jeopardize due process. Yet the “preponderance of evidence” standard is the same burden of proof used in most civil cases, and the Department of Education’s Office for Civil rights has favored it as “the appropriate standard for investigating allegations of sexual harassment or violence.” Other sources have raised concerns about the rate of false reports, but a Department of Justice study showed that the rate of false reporting, as determined by police, hovers around eight percent. Meanwhile, over 60 percent of rapes go unreported.
There is little chance that the new evidentiary standard will cause scores of innocent students to be expelled from the university. Instead, it will facilitate the path to justice for survivors of sexual violence.
Conspicuously, the new policy makes no mention of affirmative consent. Affirmative consent—which is a standard used by many of our peer institutions—should be our standard as well. The University should continue to adjust its policies until it is clear that only “yes” means yes.
As important as it is for Harvard to actively support survivors in the awful event that a sexual assault occurs, it is even more important to stop sexual assaults before they happen. Beyond updated policies for prosecuting offenses, the University school should further develop preventative practices. These should include more frequent bystander intervention training, so that fewer men and women at Harvard have to suffer the trauma of sexual violence during their time here. All the policy changes in the world will not be effective unless we can also reinforce a positive, safe campus culture. That requires support from everyone on campus, from victims to friends to bystanders.
The addition of “preponderance of the evidence” and the prospect of “affirmative consent” both come down more severely on accused assailants. It is our hope that students respond to the University’s new stance by being ever more conscientious and ever more vigilant. Now that the stakes are higher—and we certainly believe that they should be—we hope that the policy will deter potential assailants in all of Harvard’s schools from making mistakes that ruin the lives of themselves and of others.
Harvard has an especially important role to play as a leader among higher education institutions. We hope that the University can use its reputation to set a positive example for other institutions. Ultimately, it will take more than the work of one school to change the culture of disrespect that catalyzes rape in many sectors of our society.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To accommodate a growing range of students taking computer science courses, the Computer Science Division will offer a new course, Computer Science 125: “Algorithms and Complexity,” as a more advanced alternative to existing theory courses, starting this fall.
Two existing courses that fulfill the theory requirement for computer science concentrators—Computer Science 121: “Introduction to the Theory of Computation” and Computer Science 124: “Data Structures and Algorithms”—have increased in size in recent years and attracted non-concentrators from fields such as mathematics and physics, Computer Science professor Michael D. Mitzenmacher ’91 said in June, who will co-teach Computer Science 125.
“We’ve had this idea for a while that it would be nice to have an intense introductory theory course that included material from both 121 and 124,” said Mitzenmacher, who will be teaching alongside Computer Science professor Salil P. Vadhan ’95. He added that he hopes the course will be a “challenging course for both the mathematically inclined concentrators and computer science students.”
Computer Science Director of Undergraduate Studies Harry R. Lewis ’68 said in June that the creation of the new course was, in part, a response to the increasing number of students who entered the concentration with better preparation in mathematics than other concentrators.
“Computer Science is now the fifth largest concentration in the College,” Lewis said. “[The concentration has] grown a lot over the last decade and the range of students has expanded.”
As of December 2013, Computer Science had 253 concentrators, following a roughly 25 percent increase from the previous year, according to the Harvard College Handbook for Students.
Lewis said that he and the course's instructors have considered implementing an offering like Computer Science 125 for the past few years. A recent increase in faculty hires to the Computer Science Division made the course creation and launch possible, he said.
According to the course website, the class will serve as an “accelerated introduction to theoretical computer science,” with prerequisites that include “comfort with reading and writing mathematical proofs, at the level of Math 25 or 55.”
Though concentrators who take Computer Science 125 do not have to take Computer Science 121 or 124, they will be expected to complete another course for the theory requirement, Mitzenmacher said. To meet the requirement, he said that the students who take the course will probably complete a graduate-level theory course.
Mitzenmacher compared his hopes for Computer Science 125 to the year-long introductory course Mathematics 55a/b: “Honors Abstract Algebra” and “Honors Real and Complex Analysis” in the Mathematics Department.
“One way to think of it is, Math 55 is the challenge course for mathematicians,” Mitzenmacher said. “We wanted a similar challenging introductory theoretical Computer Science course.”
Though the course does not have a cap, Mitzenmacher said his ideal course size would be around 20 to 40 students.

Undergraduate Council leaders took a more reserved approach in outlining their goals for the fall semester, conceding that their goal to secure more funding for student groups will likely stay unfulfilled during their tenure, even as they introduced a broad plan to increase student voice in faculty and administrative decisions.
UC President Gus A. Mayopoulos '15 and Vice President Sietse K. Goffard '15 explained in an interview Monday that although they will continue working with the Office of Student Life and relevant administrators to access student group funding, any changes would likely take shape after their tenure ends in December.
“Realistically, there is a very good chance that this will not be resolved...by the time our term ends,” Mayopoulos said.
The UC allocates grants to officially recognized student groups and initiatives through its annual budget of about $500,000, which is funded largely by a $75 term bill fee. While Mayopoulos and Goffard met with University officials and hosted a rally last semester to lobby for more funding, they say the OSL is responsible for a majority of the remaining work.
Following a meeting last spring in which Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith reportedly expressed desire for more data on club funding, Mayopoulos and Goffard said the OSL would work over the summer to gather the relevant information. Mayopoulos affirmed on Monday that the UC will be meeting with new Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana and OSL deans to discuss possible future recommendations.
And while Mayopoulos admitted he was “disappointed” at the pace of the negotiations, he and Goffard still expressed optimism.
“It’s not at all like we’re giving up,” Goffard said. “Getting the funding now looks more likely than it ever has been in the past.”
Focusing on what they see as another major student concern, the two also unveiled goals to change the role of the UC in facilitating student input for administrative decisions.
Citing student outrage caused by an administrative decision to withhold Q Guide difficulty ratings, Mayopoulos said “the UC cannot continue to be a reactive body.”
Both he and Goffard outlined broad plans to incorporate student voice into faculty votes by allowing undergraduates to view items to be voted on by the Faculty Council and submit statements conveying their opinion.
Meanwhile, UC Student Relations Committee Chair Ava Nasrollahzadeh '16 said that her group hopes to increase effective communication about the UC’s work, both internally and to all undergraduates.
“Where SRC is going to focus is really effectively communicating our advocacy work,” Nasrollahzadeh said of her broad goal.
Mayopoulos and Goffard also announced a new Charlie Card and Harvard University ID integration program prepared to launch later this semester.
Harvard Transportation Services is expected to provide more details on the program later this month, Mayopoulos and Goffard said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The administrators once known as resident deans begin this semester with a new name and a clarified role in the College’s administrative structure.
The administrators, now called Allston Burr House deans, report to both the dean of the College and the masters of their respective Houses. They may serve up to 13 years in the position and are required to have earned a Ph.D. They are also formally relieved of teaching responsibilities during their first semester in the role.
Donald H. Pfister, the botanist and longtime Harvard faculty member who completed his roughly yearlong term as interim dean of the College this July, signed off on the changes before he left office. The recommendations were the work of a Faculty of Arts and Sciences committee that was convened last summer to review the resident dean position and its role in the Dean’s Office and upperclassman Houses.
The review was commissioned months after a scandal erupted in spring 2013, when it was discovered that administrators had secretly searched the email accounts of the resident deans in response to a perceived leak to the media about the Government 1310 cheating scandal.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana released a summary of the committee’s report this summer confirming the changes, but Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Colin Manning declined to provide a full copy of the report, citing confidentiality rules regarding personnel decisions.

Yellow and green flags were waving from the facade of Leverett House this weekend as students moved into McKinlock Hall, which was reopening after over a year of construction.
The building is the largest completed renovation to date in the College’s more than $1 billion House renewal project, and the modernized social spaces and bedrooms have drawn praise from the Leverett community.
“It’s spacious, it’s clean, it’s wonderful, to be honest. I couldn’t be happier with my rooming situation,” said McKinlock resident Cecilia M. Eberhard ’17.
Sula B. Ndousse-Fetter ’17, another new resident, echoed Eberhard’s sentiments.
“It’s amazing,” she said. “There’s hardwood flooring, and I think some furniture came with some of the suites, so there’s really nothing to complain about.”
The long hallways—which resemble those of Quincy’s renovated Stone Hall—feature a combination of singles, doubles, triples, and larger suites, as well as shared common spaces with couches, tables, and a television. The project included the first dining hall rennovation of the renewal process.
The building also houses elevators and gender-neutral restrooms. The changes are part of a push throughout the House renewal process to improve dorm accessibility.
While all of the restrooms are currently labeled as unisex, some may soon revert to single-sex. According to Eberhard, members of the McKinlock entryways will convene this week to determine which restrooms will be designated as single-sex and which will remain unisex.
“It’s really nice that they’re considering our personal views on the whole thing,” she said.
Leverett House Master Howard Georgi ’67 expressed his enthusiasm for the newly renovated hall and highlighted the addition of new common spaces that he hopes may help students have impromptu events.
“My favorite is the Rabbit Hole—our name for the basement common room. Leverites have already started hanging out there,” Georgi wrote in an email.
The renovated basement boasts art spaces, music practice rooms, and a lounge with games and study spaces. After moving in, Ndousse-Fetter and Kat E. Kearney ’17 made use of the communal art supplies to paint in the basement.
“Coming down here, especially in comparison to the towers, it’s just a completely new, modern space,” Kearney said.
Georgi noted that he looks forward to getting to know all the Leverett residents who are returning from last year’s scattered swing housing, as well as the incoming sophomores. House-wide events, such as community nights in the dining hall, are going to help smooth the road for those returning to the house and bolster the Leverett community, he added.
Georgi said that student input is important to successfully utilize new resources in the House.
“There will be many other changes, but I want them to come from the students, and we plan to set up a number of student groups to take charge of some of the new spaces,” he said. “We have a lot of new traditions to develop!”
Construction began on neighboring Dunster House, the first full house to enter the renwal process, this summer.

In his first major speech to undergraduates since he assumed his role as dean of the College, Rakesh Khurana reiterated his call for students’ four years at Harvard to be “transformative” and further laid out his vision for what such a college experience would look like.
Addressing freshmen gathered on the Science Center Plaza for the annual Convocation ceremony Monday, Khurana posited that students’ experiences at the College could prove either “transactional” or “transformational,” depending on whether they choose to stay in their comfort zones or branch out. He argued that the freshmen in the audience should opt to challenge themselves by choosing courses not based on perceived difficulty but on interest and asked them to socialize with students whose backgrounds differ from their own.
“A transformational college experience might look like this,” said Khurana, the Cabot House co-master who took charge of the Dean’s Office this summer. “It’s rooted in the ideal of intellectual exploration, in the pursuit of connecting with people who are different from you and learning from them, and in the process of reflecting on what you’ve learned and deciding what kind of person you want to be.”
“Instead of focusing on material goals—med school, Wall Street, business school, Kennedy School [of Government]—we focus on the path,” he later added. “You take the courses that are difficult, that interest you, not just the courses that you think you should take.”
Specifically, Khurana cautioned students to avoid focusing on their resumes: “If you see Harvard as another four years of building your resume while your life is on hold, you’re going to miss out on the best that this institution can offer and the best that you can contribute,” he said. “College is not a stop on the way to the rest of your life; this is your life.”
Khurana, just two months into the job, has described his hope for the College to serve as a “transformative experience” for students several times before. In Monday’s speech, however, he offered more details about that vision, although he did not discuss what he personally would do to foster such an environment.
University President Drew G. Faust, the highest-profile speaker in a lineup that also included Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 and Harvard Alumni Association President Cynthia A. Torres ’80, joined Khurana in warning freshmen against resume-building. Instead, she called on students to “surprise” administrators and themselves by taking advantage of resources on campus to succeed in other ways.
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith, for his part, did not diverge from his usual advice to incoming students. As he has in past years, Smith told freshmen, “don’t compare; connect” when interacting with their classmates.
The ceremony, while not interrupted by rain as previously forecasted, was a warm one. Seated under the large tent in the Plaza, students cooled themselves from the heat and humidity with makeshift fans made from folded ceremony programs.
A Harvard alumnus in attendance collapsed during Dingman’s closing remarks, abruptly cutting the ceremony short as freshmen shuffled toward Widener Library to take their class photo. By the time medical personnel arrived, the man had recovered.

Robert A. Lue, director of the Harvard Allston Education Portal, unveiled on Wednesday detailed plans for a new facility that will house much of the “transformative” programming promised last fall for the community as a part of the University’s institutional master plan for Allston.
Speaking at a meeting of the Harvard-Allston Task Force, Lue said the facility, to be located at 224 Western Ave., will include open, flexible-use space that can accommodate performing arts events, an innovation studio, or “iStudio,” locations for mentoring individual students or small groups, and an art gallery.
The space will be designed by the same company that constructed the Harvard i-Lab and is scheduled to open in February.
Lue, who is also the director of HarvardX and a professor of the practice of molecular and cellular biology, said he believes the project “resets the notion of what a communal space can be for a neighborhood.” While walking through digital floor plans, he teared up, explaining that this project will be the first of its kind in the world.
“Allston will be the beacon,” he said, for other cities interested in similar projects, including Paris, Beijing, and Mexico City. Lue said he will be visiting those cities in coming months to discuss similar projects.
Lue emphasized the portal’s commitment both to its existing mentoring programs for young people in Allston run through the Ed Portal, as well as its new adult-oriented programs like course material developed by Harvard’s schools specifically for the portal.
“Why is it that you go to school [when you are young] and you feast on learning, and then you leave school and you starve?” he asked. “We don’t want to make something that only serves some of the community.”
The project is a large piece of the community benefits package agreed upon last fall as a part of Harvard’s ten-year institutional master plan, which outlines the University's expansion in Allston. The package, worth $43 million, earmarked $8.3 million for the creation of a “transformative project” the details of which have emerged in recent months.
Kevin Casey, Harvard's associate vice president for public affairs and communications, added that the University would hire consultants to carry out “aggressive marketing to penetrate ethnic and cultural communities that we may be missing” before the space celebrates its grand opening.
While many Allston residents voiced skepticism during previous task force meetings of the vague language originally describing the transformative project, members of both the task force and the community at large who attended Wednesday night’s meeting were very supportive of the plans Lue presented.
“I think it was terrific,” lifelong Allston resident Paula M. Alexander said about Lue’s presentation. She also said that she had faith in Lue as the program’s director.
“This blows my mind,” Ray V. Mellone, the chairman of the task force, said. “This is the best thing Harvard ever did and will ever do for our neighborhood.”

Part I of a five-part series on Harvard’s incoming Class of 2018, based on data collected by The Crimson in an email survey conducted in the month of August. Part II will run on Wednesday.
More than a quarter of surveyed students in the Class of 2018—the most diverse in Harvard College history by some metrics—reported that a member of their immediate or extended family attended the College, according to The Harvard Crimson’s annual survey of the incoming freshman class.
Sixteen percent of respondents reported that at least one of their parents attended the College, meaning that they are considered Harvard legacies by the College. Members of this group “may receive an additional look” in the admissions process, according to the College’s website.
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said in an interview in 2011 that approximately 12 to 13 percent of Harvard undergraduates were considered legacies. Yale College reported that 14 percent of its Class of 2017 had legacy affiliation.
Prior connections to the College were also revealed through sibling relationships, with 8 percent of students indicating that they have siblings who matriculated as Harvard undergraduates.
Freshmen who reported coming from wealthier backgrounds were more likely to say that they have a relative that attended the College. A majority of freshmen with parents that have a reported combined income greater than $500,000 said they have a relative who attended the College, and 43 percent of respondents with parents that have a combined income greater than $250,000 said the same. Only 18 percent of those with parents that earn a combined income less than $250,000 reported that a relative was at one time a Harvard undergraduate.
The email survey, conducted by The Harvard Crimson, was emailed to all incoming freshman on Aug. 6 and closed on Aug. 28. Of the 1667 students in the incoming freshman class, 1,172 responded to the survey, representing around 70 percent of the class.
Beyond questions about their family’s history at the College, this annual survey encompassed a broad range of topics, including demographics, financial and educational backgrounds, academic and extracurricular experiences, political and religious beliefs, sexuality, drug and alcohol use, mental health, and technology preferences. The Crimson did not adjust the survey results for any possible selection bias.
Breaking it Down
While the demographics of the incoming freshman class are largely consistent with those of the Class of 2017, female students make up a smaller proportion of this year’s surveyed freshmen compared to last year’s.
According to the data, 47 percent of respondents is female and 53 percent is male, compared to a roughly even split in recent years. Fitzsimmons said in March that the College admitted more males than females for the class.
Little has changed with the ethnic composition of this year’s Harvard Yard occupants. With some students identifying as multiple ethnicities, 62 percent of respondents identified as white, 24 percent identified as Asian, and 11 percent identified as black or African American. Hispanic and Latino students make up a reported 12 percent of the class. Those numbers are consistent with official statistics released by the College.
Roughly 90 percent of respondents identified as heterosexual, remaining unchanged from last year’s survey. Four percent of students responded that they are homosexual. Bisexual students and students who are “questioning” each accounted for about 3 percent of the class.
Of those who said they were homosexual, 78 percent identified as male, 17 percent identified as female, and 5 percent identified as “other.” However, females were more likely to identify as bisexual or “questioning.” Of those who identified as bisexual, 63 percent were female, while 30 percent were male. Similarly, 66 percent of those who identified as “questioning” were female and 34 percent were male.
Position in birth order was also congruent with data from last year’s survey. A plurality of respondents—42 percent—claimed to be the firstborn child in their family, a four percentage point increase from last year’s class. Twenty-nine percent indicated they are the youngest child, while 15 percent indicated they are an only child.
Recruited athletes accounted for 11 percent of the survey’s respondents, around the same percentage as the Class of 2017, and 9 percent of students surveyed expressed interest in walking on to varsity sports teams.
From the Northeast, and Beyond
Students from the Northeast make up a slightly greater portion of this year’s respondents than those who responded to last year’s survey. More than 43 percent of the surveyed freshmen hail from the Northeast, up two percentage points from last year. The proportion of Midwesterners decreased by three percentage points, from 14 percent last year to 11 percent this time around. By comparison, 18 percent of the U.S. population lives in the Northeast and 22 percent lives in the Midwest, according to U.S. Census data.
The survey indicates that there are significant differences across regions when it comes to financial aid and family history at Harvard.
Sixty-nine percent of surveyed students who said they are from outside the United States reported that they receive financial aid from Harvard, while only 48 percent of surveyed students from the Northeast said they receive financial aid.
In addition, disproportionately more respondents from the Northeast reported having relatives that attended Harvard College. Thirty-five percent of Northeasterners said they have a relative who attended the College, compared to just 20 percent of those from the Southeast and 15 percent of those from outside the United States.
The proportion of surveyed students who live in the suburbs has remained unchanged since last year, with 64 percent reporting that they live in such a community.
Sixty percent of respondents attended a non-charter or charter public school, roughly the same percentage as the Class of 2017. The vast majority of the remaining 40 percent of students indicated that they had attended a non-denominational or parochial private school.
Forecasting Their Own Future
Members of the Class of 2018 are confident in their financial prospects after graduation, the survey shows. Forty-two percent of respondents said they expect to make a starting salary of $70,000 or more after college, compared to 38 percent of those who responded in last year’s survey.
Like last year, surveyed males expect to make a higher starting salary their female counterparts. A majority of males said they expect to make more than $70,000 out of college, while only 29 percent of females have the same expectations.
Expectations of starting salaries after college also differed based on reported family income. Forty-eight percent of respondents with parents who reportedly earned more than $250,000 said they expect to make at least $70,000 after college, while only 38 percent of those with parents who reportedly earned less than $250,000 said they expect to make as much.
Similarly, salary estimates vary among areas of academic interest. Surveyed students who said they plan to concentrate in economics were more likely to expect a high starting salary than their counterparts studying government. Fifty-nine percent of those who reported they may concentrate in economics said they expect their starting salary to be above $70,000, whereas only 33 percent of prospective government concentrators said they expect their salary to be above that sum.
Prospective computer science and engineering concentrators responding to this year’s survey were more optimistic than those of the Class of 2017 about their post-graduation income. Of that group, those who said they expect their starting salary to be above $70,000 increased by 11 percentage points, to 57 percent this year. This group includes those who reported that they plan to concentrate in biomedical engineering, computer science, electrical engineering, engineering sciences, and mechanical engineering.
In regard to their intended pursuits immediately after graduation, the percentage of surveyed students who plan to go to graduate or professional school decreased by 4 percentage points, to 47 percent, this year.
Industry interests also differed slightly from respondents to last year’s survey. While health is still a popular career choice among surveyed freshmen, the percentage of respondents who said they would like to work in the health industry ten years after graduation declined from 23 percent to 21 percent.
On the other hand, the percentage of respondents who reported that they would like to work in entrepreneurship rose by four percentage points, to 10 percent.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 1, 2014, at 11:05 p.m.
A year after posting its first winning season within the Ivy League since 2009, the Harvard men’s soccer team is brimming with confidence.
“I think we feel we can compete with anyone nationally,” said coach Pieter Lehrer, who will begin his second season at the helm of the Crimson this week.
“[There] is more of an expectation that we will be great,” co-captain Kyle Henderson added. “We have confidence in the amount of work we have put in.”
Despite losing All-Ivy performers in Ross Friedman ’14 and Kevin Harrington ’14, the team is confident that it can replace its graduated members. Henderson, who started 15 games during his junior season in 2012, and junior Jake Freeman, a 2012 honorable mention All-Ivy forward, both return after a year away as key cogs in a motivated roster.
“There has been a lot of time and effort put into making sure the season is special,” Henderson said. “We feel like we are ready and prepared because of all the work we have put in [during the offseason].”
This fall, Henderson notes that team could have as many as 20 to 25 players ready to contribute. Lehrer echoed the sentiment, saying that the team could rally offense from players all over the pitch.
“Our [junior] co-captain Mark Ashby, in the back, can win any ball at any moment,” Lehrer said. “He plays center back, but he could have a goal every other game. He has that capability.”
In its first season under Lehrer, the Crimson struggled out of the gate. The team had just seven goals through its first nine games as it opened the season 1-5-2, reaching a nadir in a 2-1 defeat at the hands of Yale to open league play, a game in which the Bulldogs scored two goals in the final three minutes of regulation.
The next week, the Crimson traveled to defending Ivy champion Cornell, where a 2-1 double-overtime win for Harvard sparked a run of five consecutive league victories. The offense surged—at one point putting up 13 goals in a seven-game stretch—before faltering with a season-ending 2-0 loss to Penn that cost Harvard the league title.
The second-place finish was Harvard’s first in the top half of the league since it won the title in 2009. The team had gone 15 league games without a win before beating Cornell, including two straight winless seasons in 2011 and 2012.
Ashby said that the team would use last year’s results as both a building block and a motivational tool.
“We want to build off of last year,” Ashby said. “A lot of us, the returning guys, are very excited about getting some redemption for losing the Ivy League title to Penn. That’s really fresh in our minds.”
In Lehrer’s second season, the coach, a UCLA alumni and former Olympic canoeist who previously served as an assistant coach at Berkeley, said the team has begun to internalize the system he preaches. With experience comes an increased attention to detail, he notes, although the overall game plan—with offseason focuses on defensive pressure and long stretches of possession—has not changed significantly.
“We will do a lot of the same stuff,” Lehrer said. “You get a little bit more proficient at it…instead of three to four passes, you can get up to 10, 12, 20 passes, which helps you move up the field and into the attacking third, where you get more chances on goal.”
The team begins nonconference play this weekend when it travels to Washington, D.C., for a pair of games. It will take on No. 9 Georgetown in its first match on Friday and finish up with George Washington on Sunday.
As the team prepares to begin the season, Lehrer stressed that the Crimson will take the same approach to each contest this year, regardless of opponent.
“Our biggest game is our next game,” Lehrer said. “In preparing for every game, we look at it as the most important one we have.”

Welcome back to campus and happy first day of classes! Whether your room is still full of unopened Collegeboxes or you’ve already done the reading for next week’s lecture, we’re sure you’ll re-adjust to d-hall food, p-sets, and the Shuttle Tracker (for all those quadlings) in no time.
As shopping week begins, here are Flyby’s tips on making it to Study Card Day effortlessly:
1) If you’re conflicted between two classes, take the one that has cuter TFs so you’ll be much more motivated to flirt your way to that A.
2) Avoid all p-set classes—who has time for that?
3) Make sure all your classes are in the same building. You’ll thank us for this in December.
4) PSA for those in the quad: CS50 office hours are now in Mather. Happy commuting!
5) Don’t take Social Studies 10a.
By the way, special shoutout to the Class of 2018! We hope you’ll learn to love this place as we do! By the way, keep on rocking those crimson lanyards.

The award for best invention at Harvard since Facebook goes John M.A. McCallum ’16 and Brooke K. Nowakowski ’16, who released Spray Cake, a cake batter ready to be baked straight out of an aerosol can, at the Harvard i-Lab early this year.
Like many undergraduates trying to maneuver through the general education requirements, McCallum and Nowakowski, Social Studies and East Asian Studies concentrators respectively, took the famous Science of Cooking, also known as Science of the Physical Universe 27.
For their final class project, the pair hatched what they thought was an obvious idea—using whip cream technology to manufacture and sell cake batter in a can.
“Honestly, we were kind of shocked it hadn’t been done before,” Nowakowski told WBZ-TV in an interview.
In one of the boldest claims of all time, Nowakowski said that Spray Cake will help their clientele consume less, as the invention allows bakers to make the proportion they want without baking an entire cake, which is all too tempting. Then again, what’s more tempting than a cake in a can that you just toss into the microwave?
With 7 billion people in the world, we all bear some collective responsibility for dropping the ball on this one.
Falling into the category of things in your life that you never knew you needed, and perfectly marketed for the ever expanding ‘people whose cooking skills are limited to the microwave’ demographic, this invention has the convenience and novelty that has already caught national attention, including coverage in The Boston Globe and TIME.
Move over Stanford, Harvard is coming for your throne atop the startup world. With Facebook and Spray Cake, Harvard may not be the most prolific incubator of startups, but with these two world-changing inventions, Harvard is making an impact.
