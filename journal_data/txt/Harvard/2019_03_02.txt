After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is astounding that with their warm, bright colors and delicate gold glints, Sandro Botticelli’s iconic paintings “The Story of Lucretia” and “The Story of Virginia,” its companion, are about violence, trauma, and sexual assault. It is no coincidence, however, that with these topics at the forefront of American political conversation, these paintings are coming together in a formidable exhibition. For the first time in the United States, these two paintings are being shown together along with some of Botticelli’s other iconic works at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. They are the at the heart of the new “Botticelli: Heroines + Heroes” exhibition which opened this Feb. 14 and will show until May 19.
Gardner bought “The Story of Lucretia” in 1894 for £3,400 — it was at the time the first work by Botticelli to come to America and the painting has remained in Boston ever since. Its companion (the piece it was meant to be shown with), “The Story of Virginia,” comes from Bergamo’s Accademia Carrara. Created during the artist’s later years, these paintings were likely produced for the Vespucci family palace in Florence and intended to be hung in the Renaissance home, perhaps even in the marital bedroom as the paneling suggests.
Each work depicts the tragedies of these women and — more importantly for the politically-minded Botticelli — the consequences of these tragedies. In “Lucretia,” the story is told in three different parts across one large tableau, intended to be read from left to right. In the first “scene,” the son of the last king of Rome rapes the eponymous noblewoman. In reaction to this tragedy, Brutus takes an oath to expel the Tarquinii from Rome and succeeds — though the revolt itself is not shown. Yet this does not stop a grieving Lucretia from killing herself, a scene which is at the foreground of the work. Though the story takes place in ancient Rome, Botticelli places it in Renaissance Florence — and while calamity is at the heart of the painting, it also emphasizes the importance of Lucrecia’s death in the founding of the Roman Republic. The painting’s eye-level placement makes the painting feel all the more large, which helps emphasize its sublimity and grandness. The David statue in the background, which is a symbol of Florence, is beautifully rendered: Its centered position readily anchors the painting’s subject in its Renaissance setting, signaling the piece’s political intentions.
In “Virginia,” seven scenes outline the disastrous events of her life. Roman politician Appius lusts after Virginia, the daughter of a centurion, even though she is already betrothed to someone else. In vengeance, Appius gets soldier Marcus Claudius Tacitus to assault and kidnap her. The case is taken before Appius for ruling, forcing Virginia to defend herself and prove her innocence. Though he is the mastermind behind the events, Appius claims that Virginia has always been a slave, thus waiving her rights. Virginia’s father and her fiancée come to plead for her freedom, but she remains in captivity. To preserve her honor, her father kills her. In response to Virginia’s death, the Romans successfully revolt against the tyrannical government, restoring the Roman Republic. Botticelli’s places the scene within a gold-gilded palace in the Classical style also meant to resemble a church, which all the more reinforces the painting’s dual political and themes.
The placement of “Virginia” and “Lucretia” on either side of the exhibition’s walls, mirroring each other, helps to stress their similarity, making their powerful message all the more strong. It is also this placement which makes the viewer feel enclosed within the room, perhaps reflecting the way the women are surrounded by hordes of people in each scene. Ultimately, this curatorial choice instills a feeling of claustrophobia in its viewers, which is effective given the intense crowdedness in each work.
Part of Botticelli’s project in updating the settings was to create a moral standard for Florentinian women: They were supposed to take inspiration from Lucretia’s and Virginia’s brave sacrifices. Yet for the contemporary viewer, it is difficult to read these women simply as “heroines.” Though the founding and restoration of the Roman Republic are monumental events, the exhibition begs its viewers to ask whether the consequences of these women’s sufferings make them triumphant players of history — or whether they are just victims of patriarchal ideas and violence.
To promote more conversations regarding art, violence, and the depiction of women, the museum commissioned graphic novelist Karl Stevens to draw comic book sketches to accompany each story. Though the stories would have been particularly well known to viewers back then, the stories might be less familiar to contemporary audiences. To this end the comics are incredibly useful for explaining the various occurrences.
While the works by Botticelli are central to the exhibition, viewers should not forget the display’s other equally impressive and thought-provoking paintings. “Four Scenes from the Early Life of Zenobius” and “Three Miracles of Zenobius” from London’s National Gallery are particularly well-paired tableaus depicting the Saint’s many miracles. Borrowed from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, “Three Miracles of Zenovius is another part of this series that illustrates Botticelli’s formal use of separate “scenes” to tell a story. “Adoration of the Magi” from the Uffizi is another extraordinary masterpiece, particularly fascinating as it was never completed. Much like the main pair of paintings in the exhibition, these works raise questions about how to portray and confront violence in art. Altogether, Boston is lucky to find itself the place that reunites these masterful works.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dozens of electronic music fans from Harvard and the Greater Boston Area filed into the Adams Lower Common Room on Feb. 20 to hear a talk from German trance music legend Paul van Dyk. Hosted by the Harvard College Electronic Music Collective, van Dyk discussed his life, his music, and his groundbreaking career.
The DJ and producer grew up in East Germany, unable to listen to his favorite music except by tuning in to illegal radio stations. He would eventually become the first electronic artist to be nominated for a Grammy. Today, van Dyk is best known for pioneering the sub-genre of trance and for his hit songs “For An Angel” and “Nothing But You.”
During the event, van Dyk shared his unique personal story and offered advice for young musicians, particularly those in college. Asked how he got his start in the music industry, van Dyk said, “I started making mixtapes for myself and some friends, and one of my friends actually passed on my mixtape to the guy at the door of Tresor… There were a few things where I was in a lucky position, but the thing is as well to take your chance; make this real.”
Van Dyk emphasized the power of resilience and love in the face of adversity. The artist suffered a brain injury in 2016 after falling 33 feet through a stage during the “A State of Trance” festival in Utrecht. It took several years for him to return to touring. “In the first few days, when I was still in a coma… I was connected to all the machines, so there was no brain function, and I was not aware of anything,” the musician said. “But when [my wife] came and asked me to grab her hand, I did. So there was something inside of me that was not my brain that knew this is my girl. And that’s the meaning of life: that’s the soul, that’s love, that’s connection.”
Van Dyk also stressed the importance of pursuing an education, even if it means delaying musical dreams. “At the end of the day,” he said, “I believe in education… If you have the chance to actually study, to learn, if you are given the great gift of knowledge in a place like Harvard — take that gift, learn as much as you can. And then, with what you learn, make your dreams come true.”
The crowd was a mix of college students and community members. Many attendees were long-time fans of van Dyk’s work: One woman said she had attended 80 of his shows, and another said she had been a fan for more than 20 years. Other guests included producers and DJs living and working in the Boston area.
Community member Alex J. Birch attended the event. “Paul van Dyk has been doing this since as long as I’ve been alive. He’s been DJing, and he’s a huge initial part of the German trance scene,” Birch said. “So just to hear some of his background, how he got into the whole scene, and I’m also very interested in how he’s interested in politics as well.”
According to Fay Huo ’20, co-president of the Harvard College Electronic Music Collective, this diverse audience is typical for her organization. “We invite people from the greater Boston area, not only just Harvard students. We are very inclusive, actually,” Huo said. This is something we’re proud of. We strive to be a platform, a community, that can collect all the musicians, producers, and DJs that are interested in electronic music to come to our events,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The world of colonial Malaysia is a pulsing, dynamic land. In Yangsze Choo’s “The Night Tiger,” it is augmented in unimaginable ways, filled with exponentially heightened colors, dreams, and emotions in a quivering, hallucinatory mystery where local and diasporic mythologies come to life. This scintillating world that Choo weaves is a world hopelessly entangled in threads of fate and death, ordered along rules of ritual and folklore.
The quick-witted Ji Lin is working at a dance hall to pay off her mother’s mahjong debts when she unexpectedly picks up a gruesome souvenir from a client — a severed finger, mummified and preserved in a specimen bottle. Ren, a Chinese houseboy whose master died after suffering prolonged and torturous fevers from malaria, is tasked with retrieving his master’s lost finger. Ren must find the finger and bury it with his master before the 49th day after his passing, or risk that his master’s soul will forever wander the earth. But misfortune and death seem to follow Ren on his journey to seek out the finger — tigers pick dogs off the streets and strange killings are happening. There are whispers of men turning into tigers with deformed paws, whispers that make Ren shiver and determined to bury the finger as soon as he can. He wonders, “If his old master is in fact doomed to roam this vast green expanse forever, trapped in the form of a tiger.” Ji Lin and Ren’s lives collide, colossally and momentously, in her mission to return the finger to its rightful owner and his mission to save his master’s soul. Even the greatest literary thrill-seeker will not want for intrigue — there are murders, theft, an illicit human body-part trade, conspiracy, mythology, and ghosts.
But what truly makes the novel so haunting and stunning is not the physical landscape, the bodies, nor the string of dazzling plot points — instead, the beauty of “The Night Tiger” lies in the cobwebs that string all these together: legend. Myth, folklore, oral histories and tradition, ritual, fate, the unstoppable current of what is meant to be — all of this comes to coalesce in an undeniably spectacular world of Choo’s creation. There is an unspoken natural order, “An invisible shroud or cocoon, those fine filaments spun out of nothing,” created through eons of tradition — and the most perverse violations of it. There are rules that everyone knows, that govern all existence and death — and punishments doled out for failing to observe them. The sheer intensity of Choo’s world-building is striking.
No matter how striking the plot and world of “The Night Tiger,” it is important to consider the implications of playing with mythology in the way that Choo does. In the imagination of the West, the “Orient” is frequently imagined as an exotic place of intrigue and passion. Notice that each of these descriptive words has been previously used to describe the landscape that Choo creates in the novel. Undoubtedly, the striking and folkloric world of “The Night Tiger” comes at the cost of playing into and reifying larger narratives of orientalism that fetishize and exotify Eastern culture and ritual. Each element of Malay and Chinese mythology is exaggerated beyond proportion — each Chinese character is shockingly superstitious, placing a disproportionate amount of faith on lucky and unlucky numbers. The idea of the matched set of five, the importance of couplets of items, the ominousness of the number 49, and the luckiness of six and eight appear so frequently that it edges on ludicrosity. Beyond the hyperbolic superstitiousness of Chinese characters and their obsession with numbers, mythological aspects and the faith of Asian characters in it is a systemic problem of the book.
This exaggeration is necessary for the fluidity of the plot and to create the hallucinatory and spectral effect that makes the novel so compelling. It also does, however, risk reinforcing geopolitical and cultural narratives of Asia as superstitious, irrational, and exotic. In a moment of startling self-awareness, “The Night Tiger” comments of its British characters, “This is what they have come East for: adventures like tigers in the garden, Oriental dancing girls, and cobras in their beds.” And what about the readers of “The Night Tiger”? What have they come to the novel for? The same things: stories about tigers in the garden, Oriental dancing girls, and ghosts.
Undeniably, however, embedded in Choo’s novel is a criticism of colonialism, albeit not as harsh as deserved. References to the darker, unseen forces that silently govern the everyday existence of Malaysian locals seem to hint at a critique of imperialist ventures and underlying currents of uneven geopolitical power dynamics. Underneath its sparkling, somewhat romantic exterior, there are dark things brewing in this world.
But despite the possible implications of playing into mainstream orientalist representations of Eastern culture and tradition, it is irrefutable that Yangsze Choo’s “The Night Tiger” is a stunning combination of romance, mystery and tragedy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It felt like poetic justice.
Nearly a year after Harvard men’s basketball’s 2018 campaign ended in the Palestra at the hands of Penn in the Ivy League Championship, the Crimson fed off of a sold-out crowd at Lavietes Pavilion to sweep the season series from the Quakers by a 59-53 score, clinching a spot in this season’s Ivy League Tournament in the process.
Harvard (15-9, 8-3 Ivy) rode its depth and balance to its second win over Penn in as many weeks, as four players scored in double figures to help the Crimson secure an Ivy Madness berth, and severely damage the Quakers’ chances of qualifying in the process.
“One of the things that helps us keep pushing and keep fighting during a game is that memory of Philly last year,” said sophomore guard Rio Haskett. “Remembering how it felt, every time we see them, we just try to give it back to them.”
Although Penn (16-11, 4-7) led for much of the first half, Harvard refused to be deterred, coming up with stop after stop on the defensive side of the floor to earn one of the grittiest victories of the season. Despite AJ Brodeur’s 24 point performance, the Quakers were unable to break through Harvard’s stout defense down the stretch, and were left to rue their missed opportunity to climb into the final spot in the top four of the Ancient Eight. Penn was held to just 34 percent shooting for the game and fell to sixth in the league standings — especially impressive for the hosts, considering they were missing star defender Justin Bassey.
“Very happy with how we defended,” Harvard Coach Tommy Amaker said. “I thought we played with a great deal of energy, and we fought them, which we needed to do.”
The Crimson played with the toughness and poise of an Ivy League contender, and were unfazed by several cold streaks on the offensive end. On two separate occasions, Harvard went over six minutes without a field goal, but relied heavily upon the crucial performances of sophomores Danilo Djuricic and Haskett, whose play off of the bench was the difference in a game lacking much offensive rhythm.
“I thought Mario and Danilo, and the kids that came off our bench for us did a tremendous job,” Coach Amaker said. “I was really pleased with that.”
Djuricic and Haskett both drilled three triples apiece, coming up with 10 and 11 points respectively, all the more important on a night when junior guard Bryce Aiken struggled to weather waves of Penn defenders that Quakers’ coach Steve Donohue sent in his direction. Just 13 days after Aiken’s heroics carried the Crimson to a thrilling overtime win at the Palestra, Penn seemed determined to make anyone other than No. 11 beat them.
Harvard was more than willing to oblige, riding Djuricic, Haskett, and a game-high 12 points and 10 rebounds from first-year Noah Kirkwood. Kirkwood’s double-double was the first of his career, as the Northfield Mount Hermon product led all players on both teams in rebounding.
“That’s what we need him to do, that’s what he’s expected to do,” Haskett said. “He’s tough, he’s really coming into his own, and maturing really fast.”
With the Quakers’ Ivy League Tournament hopes hanging by a thread, Coach Donohue employed a very deep rotation, using 12 players in the hopes of wearing out Harvard’s eight-man rotation. Sparsely used center Mark Jackson saw his first action in Ivy League competition, playing for the first time since November. The 7’3 sophomore from Salt Lake City towered over Harvard’s Kale Catchings, but only played two minutes, scoring one point.
For the second straight game, Catchings saw significant run, after his career-high 16 points at Yale last Saturday. Catchings, Kirkwood, and fellow freshman Mason Forbes all played at least 13 minutes, and demonstrated Coach Amaker’s confidence in his first-year players, choosing to ride the hot hand over the more experienced bench options of Henry Welsh and Robert Baker.
“It speaks to the team that we have, and the word sacrifice that we’ve embraced all year,” Coach Amaker said. “You know what, those guys could be ready to play possibly tomorrow.”
After a see-saw second half, the final minutes saw tense defensive stops carry the hosts to victory. One of the most understated plays of the game occured with 16 seconds, when Djuricic alertly tipped a missed free-throw back into the hands of Christian Juzang’s waiting arms, all but sealing the game and serving as a testament to the Brampton, Ontario., native’s willingness to make the gritty play for his team.
“The biggest thing for us, we’re such a deep team that everyone has to be ready, stay positive, and when your name gets called you go out and contribute and give it your all,” Djuricic said. “We particularly try to focus in on defense first, and let the offense come to us.”
Clinching an Ivy League Tournament berth was essential for a Harvard team that will hope to undo the heartbreak of last season’s Championship. Doing so by knocking off the very same Penn team that defeated the Crimson last March, for the second time this season, was icing on the cake. The Quakers, who hadn’t won in Cambridge since February of 2012, will enter the final three games of their season in must-win mode.
With senior night looming tomorrow at Lavietes Pavilion, Harvard will savor the taste of a victory over a foe that has haunted them in recent years. As the team approaches its final three games of the season, playing with the grit and toughness on display Friday night will be crucial if the Crimson hope to advance beyond the Ivy League Tournament to March Madness.
“Keeping that mindset of being desperate, that’s the big word,” Haskett said. “That’s what’s keeping us together right now, and helping us through adversity in games. We need this, we need everything.”
In just two weeks time, Harvard will be in New Haven on the eve of the Ivy League semifinal. But for tonight, the Crimson will savor the taste of revenge, a dish best served on a cold Cambridge night.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Outshooting an opponent by 5-0 through the first nine minutes of play usually sets a tone that can lead to a win, or at least a strong showing. When that opponent is Harvard, though, a machine that combines stunning offensive efficiency with a netminder who can stop almost anything, such a strategy - as with most strategies - fails to deliver.
Continuing to contradict classic hockey logic, Harvard was outshot by 33-23 but emerged with a crushing 5-2 victory to take the first game of its best-of-three ECAC quarterfinal series at No. 9/9 Colgate. Never looking back after scoring the first point, the Crimson (12-13-5, 10-9-4 ECAC) notched its first victory over the Raiders (21-9-5, 15-4-3) since winning an ECAC quarterfinal meetup in 2016.
Despite the dominant final tally, a 2-1 Harvard lead heading into the third might have made for a nail-biter - but the Crimson had other ideas. Two minutes in, junior forward Kat Hughes saw co-captain Lexie Laing near the post. Laing hit it right back to Hughes, who one-timed the puck for the score to extend the Crimson’s lead to two.
During a power play 67 seconds later, Hughes struck again to hand Harvard a second security goal, prompting the Raiders to switch netminders. After putting up four goals through the first 28 matches of the season, Hughes has doubled that count in a week, adding four in the last three games and five in the last five.
By now, the Crimson was cruising, making good on four of its 14 shots to boast a nearly 30 percent shot-to-goal conversion for the night. A minute and a half later, Harvard pounded a final nail into the coffin, this time on a five-hole shot from sophomore forward Becca Gilmore off an assist from sophomore defender Emma Buckles.
Colgate continued to pressure, but a power play goal with six minutes left failed to reinvigorate the Raiders. Time expired, and the Crimson headed to the locker room with a 1-0 series advantage. The game had been a true team effort, with nine different Harvard players on the scoresheet.
The first opened nearly as auspiciously for the Raiders as the third would for the Crimson. Aside from several impressive saves from freshman goalie Lindsay Reed through the first nine minutes, Harvard offered little, coughing up precisely zero shots and yielding five chances to Colgate.
Then, a flurry of offense just before the period’s midpoint set the stage for the remainder of the contest. On its third shot of the contest - a zinger by sophomore forward Keely Moy from just inside the right circle - Harvard was on the board.
The game held tight through the first part of the middle frame. Then, for the second time that night, Harvard converted as a period neared its midpoint. In the first iteration of a connection that would prove crucial to putting the game away, Hughes saw Laing, and Harvard was up by two.
Colgate netted its first score nine minutes later to leave a sense that it was still anyone’s game. In the postseason, though, there are no ties, and victory could only go to one side. Harvard’s players decided that it would be them. A commanding start to the third, and the contest was over.
The ECAC quarterfinal series against Colgate continues Saturday, with the puck drop slated for 3 p.m. A Harvard win means a ticket to the semis - a loss, and the Crimson refocuses for a season-deciding matchup on Sunday.
