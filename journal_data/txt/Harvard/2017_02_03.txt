After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I was seven, “Harry Potter” changed my life. Hardcover with a dust jacket embossed with gold lettering and illustration, it became as familiar as the architecture of my house or the layout of my bedroom. It was the story that quickly became a cultural touchstone that defined an entire generation: the tale of a boy wizard, his friends, and their adventures at boarding school.
J.K. Rowling’s “Harry Potter” is my favorite childhood book series. In elementary school, I toted around 400-page tomes that weighed down my backpack. During evenings, I curled up on the sofa with the books, turning page after page while my brothers’ TV shows projected blue fluorescent light. It became difficult to think of anything else.
I came to understand that I inhabited two worlds: in one, I did multiplication worksheets and ate dinner with my family, while in the other, I accompanied Harry and his friends on treks through the Forbidden Forest and cast Transfiguration spells. I was so deeply invested in both worlds that it seemed incorrect to designate one “reality” when the other demanded as much emotionally and mentally. “Harry Potter” offers a full spectrum of emotions: heartbreak, contentment, terror, indignance. His triumphs became my triumphs, his losses felt as keenly and viscerally as my own. In my most formative years, “Harry Potter” taught me how to read a book. Not literally—as in phonetics and syntax—but how to delve into fiction, to become part of a world outside of your own.
Growing up as a racial minority in a homogeneous Midwestern city, I felt like an organ transplanted into a body insistent on rejecting it, a doll made from misshapen plastic pieces, a factory mistake. I was never the victim of a hate crime, but I noticed how some people spoke to me more slowly and loudly than usual. I didn’t look like most of my classmates. The subtlest forms of ostracism and marginalization perpetually colored my experience; I felt “other,” but only in silent, inarticulable ways. My self-esteem plummeted: I hated looking at mirrors, avoided talking when I could, and kept mostly to myself. I felt pressured to project the right version of myself to the right audiences. I wore so many masks that I feared I might forget what my real face looked like.
But the world within the pages offered me the opportunity to be more multifaceted than I could have ever dreamed. Sheathed in the story, I could be as fearless as Harry, as bookish as Hermione, as big-hearted and funny as Ron. There was no problem that couldn’t be solved with invisibility, or a necklace that could turn back time, or a potion that could cure bad luck.
So much of “Harry Potter” felt not only visceral, but applicable. Rowling imbued a fantasy narrative with real-world themes of race, ability, gender politics, and social class, a nuanced ethical lesson delivered through allegory and analogy. I understood how Hermione felt when Draco Malfoy insulted her non-magical upbringing. I knew how it felt to be told you didn’t belong. I knew what it felt like to stare into a mirror and wish for more, or to get knocked off a broomstick.
Though I held this strange dual citizenship in these fictive and real worlds, I still felt that inevitable, fundamental disconnect with the world of fiction. No matter how strongly I felt included in its narrative, no matter how deeply I longed to be a part of the story, I would never be able to interact with the characters I loved. I would always be on the other side of the page.
I learned to grapple with this tragedy the only way I knew how: by replicating the stories I knew and loved best. Afternoons after school, I spent hours at my father’s desktop typing out stories—albeit poorly written ones—that sometimes spanned 20 or 30 pages. I liked formulating plot, imagining characters, provoking urgency and action. In its grandest magic trick, “Harry Potter” taught me not only how to read, but also how to write and how to want to write. The books irrevocably imbued me with the desire to write fiction, to create worlds, a love that persists even today.
But nothing gold can stay. In 2007, J.K. Rowling published the final installment of the series. I felt as though something I loved was leaving me. Never again would I be able to read a “Harry Potter” book for the first time. Instead of rationing frugally, I consumed greedily, swallowed the final installment in one sitting. Now it was too late. Three years later, I watched YouTube clips of the final movie premiere. “No story lives unless someone wants to listen,” Rowling said, visibly tearful. “The stories we love best do live in us forever. So whether you come back by page or by the big screen, Hogwarts will always be there to welcome you home.”
Rowling was right, but it was not until this year that I realized how right she was. After a divisive and contentious election cycle, in the midst of a hostile political climate, so many people sought escapism in the stories they loved best. We all just wanted to go home. “Even Dumbledore wasn't enough to stop Voldemort, but I'm not going to let Death Eaters destroy our home,” one user tweeted. Another wrote, “Don’t worry, America, we still have another book left.”
When the person vying for the highest political office in the nation performed a derogatory impression of a disabled reporter, or crudely recounted encounters in which he disturbingly violated women, or promoted rhetoric that demonizes immigrants like my family, I vividly remembered the times I was made to feel that I did not belong. And I remembered the world of “Harry Potter,” where what made you different was what made you valuable and what set you apart became your biggest asset. I remembered the story that taught me to ceaselessly advocate for inclusion, even when it got difficult. I learned to celebrate friendship. To fight bravely for what I believed in. I was taught that love is protection, the strongest kind of armor there is and the stories I’d loved best had lived with me and surfaced in the darkest hours.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Benjamin Strobel is a woodturner who takes the wood from the trees that are cut down at Harvard and turns them into bowls and pens. His products have been given as gifts to guests on campus or sold online at http://www.cambridgebowl.com. His bowls and pens have been popular within the Harvard community and have served as a reminder for many of their time at Harvard. The Harvard Crimson sat down with Strobel to discuss his work.
The Harvard Crimson: How did you learn to turn wood?
Benjamin Strobel: Woodturning and woodworking has been in my family … for about three generations now … [My grandfather] has been turning wood for many years. He travels the world and picks up wood from different places and then turns it into things. Then he passed it down to my dad and eventually to me, so that’s how I kind of started.
THC: How did you start turning wood from trees from Harvard?
BS: My dad is a professor at Yale, and he started a similar company to the one I have at Yale, and I helped him. Wood would come down on campus, and he would gather it up and he would turn it into bowls and pens. I had a friend at the Harvard Business School, and his wife wanted to give him a special gift. She wanted to give him a set of three pens. One from where he did his undergrad, one from where he did his graduate program, and eventually his MBA. I happened to have wood from the other two places, and so she went and scavenged around and talked to all of the arbors and the people that work on Harvard’s campus… I turned the pens for them and delivered it. He absolutely loved it. He showed it around to a bunch of different colleagues and professors on campus, and there was this overwhelming sense of “this is really cool; you should do this.” This is a great way to spread the heritage of Harvard and tell the history of what’s going on here through these items, these bowls and pens that tell a special story.
THC: Many guest lecturers have received your bowls and pens as gifts. Can you tell me who some of those guest lecturers are?
BS: I know a couple have been sold to the Kennedy Center. A cool story connected with that is that the house renovations are going on right now, and there is this tree that was in Winthrop and Gore Hall courtyard facing the river. This tree was probably, I estimated, around 120 years old, over 100 years old. And it was planted there when the buildings were renovated about 110 years ago. I found a postcard of an image with the tree as basically a sapling from almost a 100 years ago… When John F. Kennedy was an undergrad he lived at Gore Hall, and they still have a room that’s preserved for guests that come to stay at Harvard. So they have been giving it to people that come from the Kennedy Center as delegates.
THC: As an artist, what is your favorite thing to make out of wood?
BS: I really enjoy making the pens, and then seeing the reception that I get from the pens. For example, I just made—this happened this week—a set of pens for President Obama. I made it from some White House wood. If you look at the 20-dollar bill, it’s the tree on the right side… I made a pen from that. I heard … that President Obama received them, and he was really enthusiastic about it. That’s my favorite part—seeing people’s reactions. But I really enjoy turning the live edge bowl, when you see the bark on the bowl. Just because it looks so natural. It is something unique that you hardly ever see. Those are my two favorites. I have also made lots of tables and furniture from trees where I leave the bark on the side. Everything is up there for me, being a wood enthusiast.
THC: Where were you most excited to receive wood from?
BS: I had two places on campus that I was really excited about. I have a tree ... an oak tree, in between the John Harvard statue and the President’s office. That’s one of the oldest buildings in academia in the United States. So that’s cool that I have a tree from there. I would love, love, love to get some of the elms in Old Yard. I think that that would be fantastic. I also have some trees from the Tercentenary Theater that are pretty cool, you know, where graduation takes place. There is this quote by FDR where he gets up, and he says, “The roots of Harvard grow thick into the past,” and he was amongst these trees that are now in my driveway. I think that that is kind of cool, that he references something that I can physically hold in my hands. The stories behind the trees is what really makes it worth it. It makes it interesting.
THC: Do you have a favorite wood turning story?
BS: The Marshall’s office works closely with the President. Jackie O’Neil, she’s in charge of the Marshall’s office, and she’s kind of the ambassador, helper to President Faust. And she gave one to President Faust…and she [Faust] looked at it and said, “This is the coolest thing since sliced bread.” I have that as a bragging right.

For centuries, the medium of drawing, as opposed to the so-called “finished” visual arts—namely, painting and sculpture—was primarily conceived of as a preparatory and private process, to be undertaken within the confines of the artist’s studio and left unviewed by the general public. The products of the practice have now moved beyond the artist’s personal sketchbook and into the third floor of Harvard Art Museums.
“Drawing: The Invention of a Modern Medium,” on display in the Harvard Art Museums’ University Teaching and Research Galleries from Jan. 21 through May 7, 2017, seeks to make visible the transformative historical moment in which drawing emerged as an independently recognized practice. The show primarily features works from the 18th and 19th centuries. But how exactly does “Drawing” take the age-old private practice and make it new—and, as its title suggests, “modern”?
Professor Ewa Lajer-Burcharth from the Department of History of Art and Architecture—who co-curated the exhibition with Elizabeth Rudy, Carl A. Weyerhaeuser Associate Curator of Prints—believes that a dramatic shift in the conditions necessary for art production helped play a role in increasing the visibility of drawing. The result was a surge of interest in drawing as an independent means of expression, an elevation of its status to an object of aesthetic reflection, and a newfound desire to display drawings as finished products on museum walls. “The argument [the exhibition] makes is that drawing becomes modern in the 18th century, and the reason for it is that it leaves the privacy of the artist’s studio and enters the social sphere,” said Lajer-Burcharth. “Before this historical moment, drawing resided in portfolios. Now, it was framed, put under glass, and exhibited under the Salon.”
Despite its emphasis on historical context, the exhibition interestingly does not adopt a traditional chronological or oeuvre-based arrangement. Instead, works are separated into sections titled Medium, Discourse, and Object, each of which brings a specific set of discourse and theoretical questions to the viewing of drawing. Each section contains subsections with two to three selected drawings. These subsections allow readers to hone in on a specific thematic concern within the larger field. A subsection under “Discourse,” for instance, prompts viewers to consider the relationship between the immediacy of drawing and representations and indices of violence; another, categorized under “Medium,” invites consideration of the formal properties of line and its function as both temporal marker and symbol of the “artist’s touch.”  “What we wanted to do with the exhibition [was to allow] one to construct a historical argument without applying a historically linear structure of display,” said Lajer-Burcharth.
It’s an intellectual process with which Harvard students were heavily involved. Twenty students enrolled in two seminars co-taught by Lajer-Burcharth and Rudy, offered in the Fall 2015 and Spring 2016 semesters. In the first course, titled Drawing: Object, Medium, Discourse, graduate students actively discussed the selection of works with independent research. Students produced new scholarship in the form of essays on their six selected subsections, all of which are included in the exhibition catalogue.
The second course, Drawing on the Exhibition, offered primarily undergraduate students the opportunity to think through the physical act of display. Students were responsible for developing gallery labels for each artwork and other short written content. Another product of the group’s work on the exhibition content was the development of a digital tool. The tool includes audio commentary on specific artworks and a kind of visual tour through each subsection of the gallery. “The digital tool wasn’t something we’d planned from the outset…. [but] after working with the students over the course of the semester, we realized how excited they were about the drawings and how much they had to say, so we decided the digital tool would serve as a platform to showcase the museum’s fantastic collection,” said Rudy.
In an exhibition as heterogenous and complex as “Drawing,” perhaps the grounding element is student involvement. The hybrid exhibition is an extended, collaborative project that pushes the boundaries between the purely curatorial and the purely academic. “There really hasn’t been a project quite like this,” said Rudy. “The exhibition and the catalog came out of working with students, developed in tandem with them. And we’re extremely pleased with the result.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The City of Cambridge has opted to remain a so-called “sanctuary city” despite President Donald Trump’s recent executive order that aims to withhold federal funding from cities that use that label. In remaining a sanctuary city, Cambridge is opting not to force its law enforcement to work with federal officials regarding the prosecution of undocumented immigrants or other minorities vulnerable to the Trump administration’s policies, such as Muslim Americans.
Cambridge’s decision is an honorable and just one. We opined previously that President Faust’s decision not to label Harvard a sanctuary campus was sensible, given the fact that the application of the term would potentially lead to a reduction in federal funding for University research and other negative ramifications, without providing any tangible benefits for at-risk students. That said, the sanctuary label has real, positive implications when applied to a city. In remaining a sanctuary city, Cambridge will be able to help prevent unlawful detainment and racial profiling of its undocumented residents.
Additionally, undocumented people may not be the only ones to benefit from this label. If Trump follows through on his campaign pledge to create a national registry of Muslims, Cambridge and other sanctuary cities may resist that plan by refusing to carry out Trump’s policy if it attempts to enlist the help of the local police force and other municipal agencies. The sanctuary city label will also allow Cambridge to provide necessary resources, like emergency health care, to both undocumented and racially targeted residents, which they may not receive from the federal government under the Trump administration.
Of course, while we agree with the city’s decision, it is not without significant drawbacks, as Cambridge could lose more than $15 million in federal funding for programs such as free and reduced-price lunch if the order goes into effect. A resolution to this problem could call for the Massachusetts government to aid its sanctuary cities if they suffer funding crises caused by the President’s executive order, and we hope that state governments will support sanctuary cities in this fashion. All cities have a duty to resist bigoted and unconstitutional policies that endanger the livelihood of their citizens, and state governments should rise up to ensure that cities can meet this duty.

I wasn’t too big on getting Asians into the hip-hop room because I felt it wasn’t our place. Boys I knew were trying to hack simultaneously into Harvard, their neighbors’ wi-fi, and our high school grading portal until one kid got suspended for two years for a prank and they figured that wasn’t the way to go. Most of us were under house arrest until the tail end of senior year, and though I figured there had to be some Asian kid somewhere who knew the struggle past trying to sneak out of the house, back then, it felt a lot like really believing Schrodinger put the cat in the box. We were diasporic, but it wasn’t as cool as the word sounded, because that diaspora consisted mostly of knowing our parents were all friends with bad childhoods that manifested in some ugly competition. We took SAT practice tests on Christmas Eve. We were ridiculously bored. We all had our striving, trifling, petty Asian cards on the table. Then Rich Chigga walked over. It wasn’t that he was hard. The kid was just recognizable.
Rich Chigga is Brian Imanuel from Indonesia, seventeen-years-old, Vine star, home-schooled, and rapper of “Dat $tick,” which went viral and racked 32 million views some time last year. He wears a fanny pack and a pink polo shirt. The track blew up after getting low-key reviewed in a reaction video put out by his manager with rappers Tory Lanez, Desiigner, and Ghostface Killah. He never set foot in the United States. He learned all his English off the Internet. He jokes about suicide, police, sex, vaping, Hot Topic, baby-eating, blackout nights, and bad grades on Vine. When he was 12, he posted a picture of his photoshopped serious-as-hell self, wearing a sweatshirt with the n-word, next to a smiling Obama. In a freestyle on his seventeenth birthday he raps, “Tell your mommy and your daddy that you’re losing to a winner,” which hits close to home. Then, in an interview with Pigeons and Planes, he says, “I avoid talking about my race at all times because I think that’s corny,” which hits even closer. He’s that kid whose innocence went way faster than his maturity. He’s got more talk than back. But he’s also an Asian kid with a bad underbite. He may be from Indonesia but most of us learned our styles off YouTube too.
I first heard Rich Chigga in July. My roommate and I, stuck on campus, made a celebratory playlist of the worst rap we could find since the white kid of the trio was slipping from Worcester to visit, and included the classics like Cupcakke and Flynt Flossy. Without classes that summer we didn’t have many hobbies besides blasting the tunes from my third-floor window. We included Rich Chigga no question, next to Ryan Higa’s “Chingsta”, since he was mean mugging in a fanny pack. He looked like he needed some sleep. The humor was obviously the incongruity, how low his voice was compared to his body, how hard he sounded against his look, how young he was adjacent to his claims.
But the humor was also in the aggression of his lyrics, fake, constructed, and you could tell by how unapologetic they were, which some people figure at the start and others after digging through the records. How he said it wasn’t easy to mess with him when he shrunk up after a couple of interviews, just point out his name, the n-words, his Indonesian-ness, his youth and anything pointing to inauthenticity, so clear it crystallized. How he said he didn’t have a problem killing pigs but then got worried about offending people. How he described the political situation in Indonesia as gang rivalry between public schools but was homeschooled since the age of eight. And TIME said he was “in person…more serious than you’d expect,” XXL claimed he was “…out to prove he was more than just a funny guy,” and Rap Genius said he was going to “break down the political side of his viral hit.” I feel they got him wrong. A friend once told me he always thought he was cool inside, then he got to college, then he was cool outside, like a car, and I believed it. His sense of cool was intangible too. The yellow boys I grew up with had a charisma, slouched, subtle. You wouldn’t have been able tell it on paper either though.
Rich Chigga matches the string of other rap-influenced yellow males whose styles are incongruous with their cred, but I wouldn’t limit the phenomenon to just rap-influenced, or even yellow. We all seem more mysterious, hostile, sugared-up, simple, good, busty than we really are past the strip, an easy product of curating your own image. But I would say Rich Chigga’s existence as virtually formed, hyper-experiential, foreign, contradictory, is more racialized than he believes. The rejection of his motherland as irrelevant combined with his acceptance of a music so irresistibly cool, a humor so darkly satirical, a country so dedicated to the erasure of Asianness, seems close. Growing up I couldn’t see China past the green of my father’s hometown. I wouldn’t know the seriousness of depression or rape if you slapped me with it since I hadn’t acknowledged their possibility in my self-perceived undesirable, unsuffering Asian upper-middle-class body. When my father told me he signed a petition to ban rapper YG’s “Meet the Flockers” for its anti-Asian, pro-robbery content, I defended the rapper without ever listening to the song or reading its lyrics, citing artistry, history, and freedom of speech. Our country has a way of bleeding itself onto the world.
Rich Chigga could have walked into my high school life and blended in seamlessly. A kid I used to mentor in my brief stint (read: six years) at pre-college Science Olympiad told me “Dat $tick” was “muy fuego,” so I asked if I could quote him. It reminded me of how racially confused we could get, which at the time, seemed a great comfort.

Samira Asgari, a Harvard affiliate and Iranian scientist barred from entering the United States this weekend, is suing President Donald Trump and arguing she should be allowed to enter the country.
Asgari, who planned to research tuberculosis at Harvard Medical School, is one of at least four Harvard affiliates prevented from travelling to the United States since Trump signed an executive order restricting immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries on Friday.
Asgari’s suit, filed Wednesday in federal court, charges that she was unlawfully barred from the country despite possessing a valid travel visa, contradicting an emergency restraining order issued by Boston federal judges Sunday that halts Trump’s order for seven days.
The suit names several Department of Homeland Security officials—including department Secretary John F. Kelly—as defendants in addition to Trump. The legal action asks that Asgari be admitted to the United States.
The defendants “caused irreparable harm to the Plaintiff by denying her the opportunity to appear at the Boston port of entry,” the suit reads.
Asgari has been rebuffed from flights to the United States twice: once on Saturday in Frankfurt, Germany, and again on Tuesday in Zurich, Switzerland. Now, she and her boyfriend—who quit his job in expectation of the couple’s move to Boston—are awaiting the results of the lawsuit in Lausanne, Switzerland, while staying with friends, Asgari said in an interview Thursday.
“I’m still hopeful,” Asgari said. “I really hope a fair solution, a human solution can be found to all of this and soon.”
“In my case, I need the job; I cannot stay at my friends’ place forever,” she added.
Asgari’s suit also alleges officials from United States Customs and Border Patrol—a division of the Department of Homeland Security—told Swiss International Air Lines it would be forced to pay $50,000 in fines if the company permitted Asgari to board a flight to Boston.
“As a matter of policy, we do not comment on pending litigation,” Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Gillian Christensen wrote in an emailed statement.
Trump’s executive order suspends immigration from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen for 90 days and prohibits entry for Syrian refugees indefinitely. The policy sparked demonstrations and lawsuits across the country and in Harvard Square over the weekend.
Government officials have worked to define the exact implications of the order and to put it into practice over the last few days. On Tuesday, the Justice Department published a memo from the State Department, circulated internally the previous Friday, that revoked most visas for travelers from the seven countries identified in Trump’s order.
The State Department memo allows for repeals of the revocation “on a case-by-case basis.”
Asgari said she was shocked and angry when she heard her visa could have been revoked. She said she first learned the news from a journalist, who called and told her.
“This just can’t happen like that, without even informing the individual,” Asgari said. “I expect to get notification from an official if that’s the case. It’s really frustrating, it’s like I’m always behind a few steps.”
She declined to comment on the lawsuit, but said she and her boyfriend have been trying to distract themselves from the “stressful” situation by “putting a bit of order” in their lives and finding “automated” things to do.
Asgari said there is one moment, however, she cannot put from her mind.
“I remember still very clearly the moment that I was in Frankfurt Airport about to board and I was put out of the line, I remember that I couldn’t say anything, I was so shocked,” she said. “That moment just keeps repeating itself in my head. Pretty much every night that comes back before going to sleep.”

Seeking to stem the proliferation of student organizations, the Office of Student Life will not accept applications for any new student groups this semester and may revise the approval process for groups seeking official recognition.
Currently, the College has 442 recognized independent student organizations, 31 of which were approved at the start of the academic year in a process that usually garners little attention or scrutiny from the student body.
The Office of Student Life plans to unveil a revised policy and process for groups seeking official College recognition in fall 2017, according to Assistant Dean of Student Life Alex R. Miller. Miller, who directs OSL efforts focused on student involvement and campus clubs, identified the long-term sustainability of student groups as an area of concern.
“What we’re seeing is groups who are starting up, but are not staying sustained past that one or two-year mark,” Miller said. “This came out of a meeting from the Committee on Student Life as a recommendation for us to pause on receiving new applications while we go back and connect with colleagues and student leaders on a process that could get to some of the concerns that we have right now.”
Under the current process, the Committee on Student Life—a student-faculty committee which includes Undergraduate Council members, House Committee chairs, and OSL administrators—has formal approval power over new clubs each semester. New student organizations seeking recognition go through a multi-step process to assess their scope and purpose on campus, according to Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair.
An advisory group composed of UC members and College affiliates from offices like the Public Service Network and the Harvard Foundation then submit a recommendation to the Committee on Student Life for final decisions. Student organizations can become defunct under the current policy if they fail to register with the OSL in the fall term for two consecutive years.
Official approval by the College allows “recognized independent student organizations” to access an array of benefits. Privileges include the ability to reserve College venues for events, recruit students at activity fairs, create bank accounts with the Harvard University Employees Credit Union, and receive grants from sources like the Undergraduate Council, according to the College’s student handbook.
Current and former members of the UC agreed that an unchecked growth in the number of clubs on campus was a problem for student life.
William A. Greenlaw ’17, a former UC finance committee chair, said that he thinks there are three main concerns an enlarged number of student organizations on campus raises: limited financial resources, strains on reserving spaces, and drain on overall student life.
UC Vice President and co-chair of the Committee on Student Life Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18 said that both the Committee on Student Life and OSL are looking at a new process of recognizing student organizations that will involve more student input, although they have not yet determined how they will do so.
“I think the real reason behind this is…to make sure that we just don’t have superfluous groups that are just hanging around and aren’t really doing anything,” he said.
Greenlaw and Khansarinia both said that having a greater number of student organizations requesting funding from the UC cuts into how they are able to dole out funds to different groups.
“The funding process becomes very difficult,” Khansarinia said. “We want to take a quick pause and review the organizations we have in order to make sure that the organizations that are having events are being contributory members of the college community and can continue to get funding.”
Miller said he hopes the revised process will be more “student-driven,” particularly in its involvement of UC members and other “student leaders.”
“We would find ways to engage the UC in these conversations in ways that would heighten their voice in the overall process,” Miller said.  “What we’re hoping to do is rely on the expertise of our colleagues in that way, but also provide another larger process of student leaders who can participate in the overall application process.”

American young people agree that political discourse has become less civil in the last five years, according to an Institute of Politics survey of 771 18- to 29-year olds.
A majority of respondents to the survey said that the political discourse has grown more hostile in tone. The poll found that 62 percent of respondents—including 72 percent of Republican respondents and 54 percent of Democrats—believe that the “tone and level of civility” in politics has decreased in the last five years.
The poll’s results come more than two months after a presidential election that many have characterized as bitter and divisive. At Harvard and around the country, many have spoken out against Trump and protested actions taken by his administration, including an executive action signed last week that bars immigrants from seven Muslim majority countries from entering the United States.
When asked about their confidence in the country’s future after President Donald Trump’s inaugural address, the survey respondents split along party lines. Seventy percent of Republicans and only 11 percent of Democrats described themselves as “hopeful” after hearing the speech on Jan. 20. Forty-eight percent of Democrats said they felt “fearful.”
In general, respondents were roughly evenly divided between hope, fear, and uncertainty in their attitudes about the country’s future under Trump.
Following a nationwide trend, a majority of survey respondents said they approved of the job Barack Obama did as president. Sixty-four percent of overall respondents said they approved of Obama’s performance, with including 95 percent of Democrat respondents and 25 percent of Republican respondents supporting Obama's tenure.
The IOP issues its Young Americans’ Attitudes poll several times per year, adjusting questions based on political current events. In spring 2016, for example, the survey polled favorability of then-presidential candidates Ted Cruz, Bernie Sanders, John Kasich, and Hillary Clinton.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Drew G. Faust joined almost 50 university presidents from across the country in signing a letter Thursday imploring President Donald Trump “to rectify the damage done” by his executive order on immigration.
“We write as presidents of leading American colleges and universities to urge you to rectify or rescind the recent executive order closing our country’s borders to immigrants and others from seven majority-Muslim countries and to refugees from throughout the world,” they wrote. “If left in place, the order threatens both American higher education and the defining principles of our country.”
The order, signed by Trump Jan. 27, prevents all refugees from entering the United States for 120 days, Syrian refugees indefinitely, and immigrants from seven countries—Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen—for 90 days.
While the university presidents who signed Thursday’s letter wrote that they “recognize and respect the need to protect America’s security,” they argued that current vetting procedures are already sufficient, and “this action unfairly targets seven predominantly Muslim countries in a manner inconsistent with America’s best principles and greatest traditions.”
The presidents, including the leaders of every Ivy League institution, emphasized the positive contributions people from these countries have made to their universities and the United States more broadly.
“We welcome outstanding Muslim students and scholars from the United States and abroad, including the many who come from the seven affected countries,” they wrote. “Their vibrant contributions to our institutions and our country exemplify the value of the religious diversity that has been a hallmark of American freedom since this country’s founding.”
The ban sparked protests across the country, as hundreds of people found themselves barred from the country or their legal status within the country imperiled. At least four Harvard affiliates from the targeted countries have been unable to enter the United States; one of those affiliates, Samira Asgari, sued Trump in federal court Wednesday, arguing that she should be allowed to enter the country. In Cambridge, students and researchers raised concerns at a town hall event Wednesday about their ability to stay if their visas expire.
In a message to Harvard affiliates Sunday, Faust defended international affiliates and called on “the administration, the Congress, and the courts” to reconsider the order. She also outlined measures the University will take to support affiliates impacted by the ban, including providing legal counsel and lobbying the federal government.

The Harvard Business School has surpassed its $1 billion capital campaign goal over a year ahead of the campaign’s deadline, prompting a $300 million addition to the original campaign goal.
Despite surpassing its overall goal of $6.5 billion last year, University President Drew G. Faust has repeatedly said Harvard will not raise its overall fundraising goal, though some peer universities, like Columbia, raised their goals during successful capital campaigns.
But the Business School is taking a slightly different tack than the University, raising its goal before the campaign's end.
“As we look to the next two years, we have identified an additional goal of $300 million we seek to raise, reflecting the importance of sustaining the initiatives we have launched, providing future flexibility, and strengthening the core,” Business School Dean Nitin Nohria wrote in a press release.
During the “quiet phase” of the campaign, which was publically launched in June 2014, the school raised more than $600 million in gifts and pledges. Since then, it has raised the remaining $400 million thanks to more than 24,000 “alumni and friends” that contributed to the campaign, Ellen Harkavy, the senior director of the Business School campaign, wrote in an email.
The Business School’s goal of $1 billion comprises 15 percent of the University-wide $6.5 billion campaign. It is the second largest goal among Harvard’s schools, after the $2.5 billion campaign goal for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
Harkavy wrote that the money raised in the remainder of the campaign will be used to support faculty research, endow more associate professorships, and fund financial aid for MBA fellowships. Harkavy also wrote that the Business School plans to work with the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences—its future neighbor in Allston—to “build educational bridges” between the schools.
“The list of ways the Campaign has impacted [the Business School] has both breadth and depth,” Harkavy said.
She also said the Business School will use the funds from the campaign to bolster the HBS Fund for Leadership and Innovation.The Business School’s capital campaign will conclude in June 2018, along with those of the University’s other schools.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Thousands of Harvard alumni urged Jared C. Kushner ’03, a top official in President Donald Trump’s White House, to use his platform to “influence the Trump administration, and Mr. Trump himself, in a positive way” in an open letter published earlier this week.
David B. Rochelson ’05 penned the letter addressed to Kushner, who is Trump’s son-in-law and a senior adviser to the President.
“Harvard’s motto is simple. It is just a single word: Veritas. Truth,” the letter reads. “It is the guiding value of your alma mater; let it be a value in the Administration as well.”
The alumni letter is one of many ways Harvard affiliates have criticized Trump and his administration. Following Trump’s executive order banning immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries temporarily and Syrian refugees indefinitely, many at Harvard have taken to the streets in protest and signed letters challenging the policy.
Rochelson drafted the letter Sunday night in response to Trump’s executive order on immigration. He posted it to his Facebook page on Monday, hoping that people would add comments to it and expand upon it.
The letter emphasizes Harvard’s values, and asks Kushner to carry those values with him in his new position.
“We ask that you remember your grandparents, refugees from Nazi Germany, when the Administration shuts our nation’s borders to the millions around the world who are fleeing conflict. They are counting on you,” the letter reads.
Rochelson, who lived in Mather House, attended the College at the same time as Kushner and said he remembers meeting him very briefly. All of Rochelson’s grandparents and great-grandparents were refugees and immigrants who fled violence in their home countries, he said, and his grandfather is a Holocaust survivor.
When Rochelson found out that Kushner’s grandparents fled Nazi Germany, he said he was “shocked.”
“I was sort of just shocked by that when I found out he and I shared that experience, and I thought: we also have our alma mater in common,” Rochelson said.
Approximately 3,000 Harvard alumni have signed the letter so far, Rochelson said.
“It just sort of took on a life of its own immediately,” Rochelson said. He later posted it online and created a Google Form allowing people to add their signatures. One of the signatories, Damien S. Chazelle ’07, directed the movie “La La Land” and was nominated for two Oscars this year.
“Ever since the election or even the campaign, there have been just thousands, millions of voices that have sort of been struggling to make themselves heard,” Rochelson said. “And I am not in the same league as people organizing marches of millions of people all around the world, so I just thought this is a small thing that I can do.”
Rochelson said he does not know if Kushner has seen the letter, but that he hopes to get a copy into his hands.
Kushner could not be reached for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Drew G. Faust praised service members and affirmed the University’s renewed commitment to its military programs at a Pusey Library event Thursday.
Undergraduate ROTC students, active duty service members, veterans, and top administrators, including Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, gathered at the event, which showcased an exhibit about Harvard's long history with the armed services.
The free public exhibit, called “‘To Better Serve Thy Country’: Four Centuries of Harvard and the Military,” was organized at the request of the Office of the President, University Archives curator Juliana Kuipers said.
Faust thanked service members in attendance and said she hoped the exhibit honored their sacrifice.
“I am a historian, and so being here to see this exhibit means an enormous amount to me,” Faust said. “And to unite it with what has been a commitment of mine as president to honoring and marking the traditions of the military at Harvard is extremely meaningful to me.”
The University has a centuries-old relationship with the United States military, but it has at times been strained. Harvard severed ties with its ROTC programs in the Vietnam War era following student protests, and only re-recognized Navy, Army, and Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps programs in 2011, 2012, and 2016, respectively. Harvard Veterans Alumni Organization Director Jonas P. Akins ’01, a Navy veteran who spoke at the event, praised Faust’s decision to bring ROTC programs back to campus.
“While there is still work to do, and adjustments in relationships like this will always have to be made, I’m very grateful for the leadership of President Faust in returning the military through ROTC and other means to a place of prominence here on campus,” Akins said.
“I’m glad that Harvard again values, and hopefully will continue to value, those who have served and will go on to serve in service of the nation and the long Crimson line,” he added.
Lieutenant Colonel Peter Godfrin, a military science professor at MIT and the director of Harvard’s ROTC program, said he believes the University has “increased its view of the military.”
“To see it kind of morph into this, where the school is putting on something at this level—putting the resources to it, the history going into this—it’s just an incredible feeling and it makes me very proud that the school and another great institution like the military are able to kind of partner in something like this,” Godfrin said.
Harvard Air Force ROTC instructor Captain Peterson Dela Cruz said events like this exhibit help increase the military’s exposure on campus. He said that since the University brought the Air Force program back to campus last April, enrollment in the program has doubled.
“Harvard stresses service a lot, and a lot of it tends to be toward public service, but you could include military service toward that,” Dela Cruz said.
The name of the exhibit itself—“To Serve Better Thy Country”—is part of the inscription etched onto Dexter Gate, which students walk beneath to exit the Yard: “Depart to serve better thy country and thy kind.”
ROTC members on campus said they appreciate the University’s renewed commitment to the military.
Kate Krolicki ’20 and Raul Cuevas ’20, both freshmen Air Force ROTC cadets, peered into the glass casings of the exhibit, filled with old photographs, letters, and maps. One black-and-white image showed cadets standing on the steps of Widener Library.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Amid growing student concerns that President Donald Trump could strip protections from undocumented students, Harvard has designated a staff member to support those students at the College.
Katie M. Derzon, a graduate student and tutor in Leverett House, will serve as the College’s first “Fellow for Undocumented Students.” Derzon wrote in an email that she sees her new role as “imperative,” in part because of the current political climate. In the fall, Emelyn A. dela Peña, the former assistant dean for equity, diversity, and inclusion, estimated that there are about 40 undocumented students at the College.
Derzon wrote that her primary responsibility in her new position will be guiding undocumented students protected under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals towards resources to help them navigate what she called “uncertain” times. She added she hopes to foster a “dialogue” between undocumented students and College administrators.
“My top priorities are to support student well-being and ensure that the voices of undocumented students are heard and addressed,” she wrote. “The strength of Harvard is due in no small part to its diverse student body that brings together the perspectives and insights of individuals from around the globe.”
Loc Truong, the College’s director of diversity and inclusion programs, wrote in an email that the College created the new position in order to better support undocumented and immigrant students at Harvard.
Truong wrote that Derzon will also be working with departments across the University—including the Harvard International Office and the Law School’s Immigration and Refugee Clinic—to share information about the needs of undocumented students going forward.
In an interview Thursday, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana agreed with Truong and said the decision to hire Derzon as part of a larger College effort to bolster its support of undocumented students at Harvard.
“I think this is a time of uncertainty and concern for everybody in this community,” Khurana said. “We have really tried to mobilize a variety of College resources to support students…to give them as much as possible the agency to make the decisions that are right for them.”
Since Trump won the presidency in November, Harvard has taken several steps to support its undocumented and immigrant affiliates. In a University-wide email sent Nov. 28, Faust promised to expand the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinical Program at the Law School and bring immigration experts to campus to provide legal advice for undocumented students.
Faust also sent an email Sunday to Harvard affiliates that said the University will hire a full-time attorney and post a website with resources for undocumented students.
On Wednesday, University administrators held a town hall with immigration experts intended to address the concerns of Harvard affiliates affected by Trump’s recent executive order, which suspends immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries for 90 days. At the event, panelists fielded questions from the audience and detailed Harvard’s lobbying efforts to protect legislation like DACA that supports undocumented immigrants.
Reflecting on her new role, Derzon wrote she thinks her greatest challenge will be adapting to what she called a constantly fluctuating political landscape in the United States. She wrote that no one can be sure, day to day, what “additional changes” to expect from Trump’s administration.
“Given the speed with which political decisions are being made, it can be difficult to predict, and thus prepare for, what new obstacles might be affecting our students,” she wrote. “Students may feel anxious and are looking to the College to give them clear directives on how to navigate the foreseeable future.”
While acknowledging many Harvard affiliates may fear the future, Khurana said he remained optimistic.
“I am cautiously hopeful,” he said. “Prejudice and bigotry often are the consequences of ignorance and the more educated we are, the more open we are to each other.”
“I believe that from the top of my head to the bottom of my toes,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s basketball team will face a stern test of its title-winning credentials this weekend as it travels to face the ‘Killer P’s’, Penn and Princeton, this weekend.
The Crimson (16-1, 4-0 Ivy), ranked 20th by RPI in the nation, has won 16 consecutive games heading into Friday’s contest at the Palestra where the team will match up with the Quakers (10-6, 3-0 Ivy), the only other undefeated program in Ancient Eight play.

“We’re really being successful at taking every game at a time and not having any opponent be bigger than another,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “That being said, [Penn] did win last year, and they basically have everyone back. I’m sure there’s a little added motivation.”
Penn, which many tipped as the preseason favorite to win the Ivy League, will represent one of the visitors’ stiffest tests to date. Led by their “twin towers,” forwards Sydney Stipanovich and Michelle Nwokedi, the Quakers have allowed just 52.9 points per game, lowest in the conference. The visitors should have extra motivation, however, as a win in Philadelphia would push the winning streak to 17, the longest stretch in program history.
“The past few years, both Penn and Princeton have been the best in our league,” freshman guard Katie Benzan said. “In order to be the best, we have to beat the best.”
The two veteran centers, both standing at 6-foot-3, lead Penn in a number of major statistical categories. Stipanovich averages 12.6 points, 9.6 rebounds, and 2.4 blocks per game, while Nwokedi adds 14.1 points, 9.0 rebounds, and 2.4 blocks per contest. Both are high-volume scorers, with 12 field goal attempts per game each.
It will truly be a standout battle in the frontcourt, with Harvard possessing its own accomplished, albeit more diverse, set of forwards. Standing at 6’3”, freshman center Jeannie Boehm has come into her own this season, showing the skill and toughness that made her a McDonald’s All-American. She makes over half of her field goals, grabs 7.2 rebounds per game, and makes things tough for opposing players in the paint with 2.6 blocks per game.
She is often joined by captain Destiney Nunley, more of a stretch-four who will likely look to draw the Quakers’ forwards out of their defensive shape. Nunley is averaging 11.2 points and 6.9 rebounds per game but has put in crucial buckets when needed, including the game-winner against La Salle and 21 points in the statement win over Temple.
With Penn forcing 14.3 turnovers and blocking 5.9 shots per game, the Crimson will have to find a way to get their perimeter players open looks without being cavalier with the ball. On the flip side, the visitors will have to prevent Penn’s guards from dishing out feeds into the paint. Quakers guard Anna Ross leads the conference in assists, so freshman guard Madeline Raster, arguably Harvard’s best perimeter defender, will have her hands full.
“There’s no secret,” Delaney-Smith said. “They slow you down with a full-court press. They attack in zone and use their height in the back line. If you knock down your shots at Penn, then you can beat them.”
Following Friday’s game is a trip to central New Jersey on Saturday night to face Princeton. Last season, the Tigers became the first Ivy League team in history to enter the NCAA Tournament with an at-large bid. Unlike the Crimson, however, Princeton (7-9, 1-2 Ivy) has struggled to cope with the loss of graduating seniors and started the season on the wrong foot.
The Tigers dropped their first four games of the season before righting the ship. Their difficult non-conference schedule made the going tough, however, with losses against Kansas State and Georgia Tech stopping the team’s progress. Princeton then opened up Ivy League play with back-to-back losses at home against Penn and Brown before recording their first conference win over Yale.
Another stout defensive team, the Tigers rely heavily on 6-foot-4 freshman Bella Alarie, who leads the team with 12.2 points, 7.7 rebounds, 2.5 assists, and 1.6 blocks per game. The battle between her and Harvard’s own freshman forward, Boehm, will be fascinating to watch.
“They play good defense,” Benzan said. “We just have to play our A game. Hopefully we can grind out the win.”
Both teams are careless with the ball, with Princeton averaging 16.3 turnovers per game to the Crimson’s 15.6. The difference is that the Tigers force 16.3 turnovers per game as well while that number is only 10.8 for Delaney-Smith’s team. A key part of this game may be which team is able to break out of its habit and take care of the ball.
Guards Tia Weledji and Gabrielle Rush are Princeton’s main perimeter threats, respectively shooting 40.7 and 37.8 percent from three-point range. Senior guard Taylor Brown is the main perimeter distributor, averaging 2.4 assists per game.
There will be opportunities for Harvard’s guards, especially Benzan, Raster, and sophomores Sydney Skinner and Nani Redford, to force mistakes on both ends from Princeton’s backcourt. Efficient guard play has propelled the Crimson to a few big wins this season, and the visitors will need that to continue if they want to extend their march to a regular season conference title.
“We’re downplaying [the winning streak],” Delaney-Smith said. “It honestly is your second season when nonconference is done. That just prepares you for conference…. We fully understand that this is a new season for us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although athletes from its men’s swimming team were not present at last weekend’s H-Y-P meet, Princeton will get the chance to take on Harvard in men’s basketball on Saturday night. The sexual misconduct scandal at the New Jersey school, which came to light seven weeks after the Harvard men’s soccer team’s season was cancelled following the discovery of a sexually explicit spreadsheet, is not the first time that Princeton has followed in the footsteps of its older—perhaps better looking—brother roughly 250 miles to its northeast.
Princeton followed Harvard’s lead in 2011 when it reinstated an early action admissions program. Woodrow Wilson succeeded a Harvard grad and a Yale alum in the White House. The Ivy Club came to be the poor man’s Porcellian Club come 1879.
However, one arena in which Princeton has not followed Harvard’s lead, for better or worse, comes in men’s basketball. It would be safe to call Princeton the anti-Harvard when it comes to tradition, style of play, and culture. While the teams have combined for just one NCAA Tournament berth since 2008, Penn and Princeton, the Crimson’s two opponents this weekend, are far and away the traditional Goliaths when it comes to Ivy League basketball. The travel partners won or shared all but two Ivy League regular season titles between 1963 and 2007. Princeton coach Mitch Henderson is in his fifth year at his alma mater. He played under legendary coach Pete Carril, winning three Ivy League tournaments in four years. Carril’s 1989 team is largely why mid-major conferences still receive automatic bids to the NCAA Tournament. Princeton, a 16-seed, took one-seed Georgetown, a team coached by John Thompson, Jr. and led by Charles Smith, Dikembe Mutombo, and Alonzo Mourning to the brink, ultimately lost by one but the game was recently called “The Game That Saved March Madness” by Sports Illustrated.
To say that Harvard does not have the basketball history that the Tigers do is like Emperor Hirohito saying that World War II did not develop in Japan’s favor after he surrendered to the U.S. The Crimson’s emergence as a threat in the Ivy League has largely coincided with coach Tommy Amaker’s arrival in Cambridge. Amaker won more games in nine-plus seasons than his predecessor, Frank Sullivan, won in 17. Harvard made more NCAA Tournaments in Amaker’s first six seasons than the program did in the first 71 seasons in which the Big Dance was held.
Princeton has an offense that is named after it. Harvard does not. While most schools do not have an offense named after them, this fact is especially appropriate for the Crimson. Defense has always been the calling card under Amaker. While the tenth-year head coach emphasizes an inside-out offense focusing on his frontcourt and three-point shooters who can keep defenses honest, Harvard’s offense, especially this season, is largely a work in progress. Harvard shot nearly 51 percent from the field last Friday against Cornell before posting an abysmal 32.3 percent clip against Columbia the next night. With defense as its rock, Harvard will have to rely largely on closing out close games. The Crimson’s 16-point win over three-win Dartmouth is probably as close to a blowout as Harvard will have in an Ivy League game this season.
Henderson, on the other hand, likes letting his horses run free. While the Tigers are only averaging 74.6 points per game, it dropped a 97-spot on Brown last weekend and put up 90 against a Monmouth team that is arguably the best competition it has faced this season. Henderson’s version of the Princeton offense relies on its bigs, headlined by senior forwards Spencer Weisz and Steven Cook. Sophomore guard Devin Cannady is the key in the backcourt but virtually everyone on the roster can shoot. Five Tigers have made 10 or more three-pointers this season and the team is shooting 45.3 percent from the field on the year.
Despite the varying styles of play and histories, the teams meet this weekend as two of the best in the conference. Coaching his most talented roster since taking the job in 2011, Henderson is somewhere between being on the hot seat and being a prime candidate for landing a big-time job or pay raise. He has yet to lead Princeton to the NCAA Tournament but has had three 20-win seasons in five years at the helm. His team was the consensus favorite to win the Ivy League this season after returning virtually its entire roster from a team that won 22 games and made the NIT. Losses to a pair of teams who did not make last season’s tournament wasn’t ideal for an experienced team or for a conference that is trying to establish itself on the national level, but all will most likely be forgotten if Henderson can get Princeton to the Big Dance.
Amaker, especially over the past two seasons, has diverged from the traditional Ivy League route and even from his own. Part of the change can be attributed to necessity and the rest is largely due to the fact that Harvard isn’t Princeton. Amaker’s team could lose the remaining 10 games on its schedule, which I personally guarantee it won’t, and his job security would not be in question. This is Amaker’s team and Amaker’s program. He is the reason why Harvard has any chance to win one or even both games this weekend. He has brought in players who could be playing for power conference programs.
Amaker has the keys to his own Corvette while Henderson is largely relying on his parents for gas money. The Tigers still rely largely on what got them the 26 Ivy League championship banners that adorn Jadwin Gymnasium—the Princeton offense, discipline, and experience. While Henderson eased in Cannady as a freshman on a veteran team last season, Amaker has made class year a moot point for this year’s Crimson team.
He starts three freshmen or sophomores and underclassmen make up more than 70 percent of the team’s minutes played this season. This formula gave Harvard fits the first time they met last season, with wings draining threes and backdoor cuts carving up the Harvard defense, much like they did when the Crimson played Columbia last weekend. Amaker, ironically coaching with nothing to lose when the teams met in Cambridge last March, rode an unexpected hero in Pat Steeves ’16 to a 73-71 victory. With this year’s Harvard team, there’s no telling who the hero will be on any given night. If you like Goliaths, go with the guests but if anyone has a trick up his sleeve to beat the Tigers, it’s Amaker.
YALE AT COLUMBIA
This has the potential to be one of the best games of the weekend. The Lions and the Bulldogs both come in with identical conference records and while Yale would be the early favorite, Columbia’s early conference performance—specifically a first half beatdown of Harvard last weekend—indicates the Lions might finally be a force to be reckoned with in the League.
Now to the important stuff: Columbia has notoriously bad wifi. No joke, you’d think that smack in the middle of New York a school with a billion dollar endowment could afford to give people some decent internet. They also kick journalists out of their seats as soon as the game is over. Harsh. Given the lack of seating then, and the fact Columbia players have no alternative but to practice given the scarcity of access to Netflix, they might just pull an upset on Friday.
Pick: Columbia 
PENN AT HARVARD
Donald J. Trump went to Penn.
Pick: Harvard. 
BROWN AT CORNELL
This year the Brown Daily Herald celebrates its 125th Anniversary. Unbeknownst to most people, this year also marks the 31st anniversary of the last time the Bears won the conference title. I don’t mean to pry, but during that last dance Brown didn’t exactly do a great job of representing the Ivy League, dropping its tournament opener to Syracuse, 101-52. It is today the seventh-largest blowout in tournament history. Before the game, Brown head coach Mike Cingiser tried to make the best of the situation, saying, "If we can take away their fast break and their offensive rebounding, then we're as good a team as they are." I wasn’t alive to watch it, but I bet it was a great game.
To be honest, I’m not completely sure where I was going with that, but I don’t think the Bears will win on Friday.
Pick: Cornell
PRINCETON AT DARTMOUTH
For about forty minutes I tried to look up what the biggest blowout in Ivy League history was to no avail—I’m not saying this game will be it, but if I really had to pick a game this season that may or may not break that record, it would be this one.
On a side note, Princeton’s daily newspaper—aptly named the Princetonian—has a section called “Street.” I’m not sure what this means, but if someone can explain this to me personally, then maybe Dartmouth can win on Friday.
Actually, probably not.
Pick: Princeton
YALE AT CORNELL
Cornell is an institution known for many things. Actually not really, but they do have the top hotel administration program in the nation. I didn’t know that was a thing, but I can’t imagine there’s anything better to do in Ithaca to be quite honest.
A deep dive into one of the most credible sources on the topic—College Confidential—suggests quite simply that, “Not all majors are created equal. Some just aren’t as intellectual or rigorous as others.” I’d like to think this is also true for college basketball. Yale comes off a season in which it upset Baylor in its first tournament appearance since 1962. Cornell has a fake hotel.
Pick: Yale
PRINCETON AT HARVARD
Just the other day the staff of the Princetonian announced its 141st managing board. Given their sports coverage includes a story entitled, “Who Really Won the Ivy League?”, however, I would hesitate to believe a Princetonian is capable of understanding the rules of basketball.
Given their undefeated record in conference though, I’ll give the Tigers the benefit of the doubt this one time.
Pick: Princeton
BROWN AT COLUMBIA
Brown’s basketball team is famous for one thing: the Bears' starting forward is Steven Spieth, is the brother of golfer Jordan Spieth. It must be rough when the stands are only full because people think they’ll get a chance to meet Jordan, but on the bright side Brown won’t be in Providence this Saturday. Instead, they’ll be inside the friendly confines of Levien Gymnasium, a place that interestingly enough also has room for a swimming pool, a wrestling gym, and no wifi. Maybe it’ll be better than playing at home? Probably not.
Pick: Columbia
PENN AT DARTMOUTH
A recent article from the sports section of the Daily Pennsylvanian went as follows: “Looking to get back into playoff picture, Penn men’s basketball hosts Harvard, Dartmouth.”
The title doesn’t raise any red flags in particular, but upon further inspection, it would appear the Quakers are actually supposed to be on the road this weekend. I think we finally figured out why Penn still hasn’t won a conference game—they have literally not showed up.
We’re all hoping they show up to play this weekend though, especially given the fact Dartmouth hasn’t won a conference game either, so if anything this is a battle for what may be one of the few chances either team will have at a win.
Pick: Dartmouth

The phrase that strikes fear in the hearts of every pre-frosh, and still inspires a healthy amount of fear in any college student that values cleanliness: communal bathrooms. We are about to expose the grossest, smelliest, and of course, the rudest things you can do to contribute to this fear.
Leaving food in the drain
We get it, you need somewhere to clean out your instant oatmeal bowl. And even if the bathroom sink is the only place you can find (hint: try common room kitchens), don’t leave the oatmeal residue in the drain. It gets crusty. Also, clean the toothpaste globs off the side of the sink while you’re at it.
Sticking hair on the shower walls
We don’t have the right to judge your man bun (really, though, it’s going out of style). But we DO have the right to tell you to keep your luscious locks to yourself. So if you shed while washing your hair, don’t just slap it on the wall of the shower. And if you do, collect it after and throw it out. You are the reason the shower drains clog.
Hogging the shower
If five people are waiting to shower at midnight, keep yours short and sweet. It’s as simple as that. Leave your hair masking for a quieter moment.
Blasting music past 2 a.m.
There are people who sleep in rooms next to the bathroom. EDM, while it might enhance your shower experience, will lose you friends on your floor. Keep your shower jamming to reasonable hours of the day.
Dumping food in the trash                  
It makes sense that you don’t want to leave your Chinese leftovers to rot in your own trashcan. But they are still going to rot in the bathroom trash, and they will get smelly and your floor mates will be grumpy. You know where smelly trash should go, so do it right the first time.
Be a good hallway mate, roommate, person. Don't be rude. Keep our bathrooms clean.

Here we are, three weeks into the semester. For many, the return to Harvard for the spring meant a glorious reunion with friends, and a return to the college lifestyle. For others, the homesickness of being away from our families for a long period of time has hit, and we’ve already called our parents a couple of times to “check up on them.”
So fortunately or unfortunately, the second semester is in full swing, which means lectures—and sections—are back. Along with them? Everyone’s favorite section kid. Yes, with “that” kid around, you may need to take a quick stop at CVS for a quick dose of headache relief before your weekly section. But if you’re looking for more healthy coping mechanism, here are a few habits of the typical section kid. And, more importantly, how to avoid them.
Arrives to class 30 minutes early
You know that feeling when you wake up at 6 a.m., do your reading for the following two weeks, review past class notes, re-watch the lecture, write down all your questions, and then get to your 9 a.m. class at 8:30am? And then you’re half an hour early only to find out your class is empty and your TF hasn’t shown up yet? So to pass the time you reread your notes and questions, then practice reciting them out loud? Literally no normal college kid does. But “they” do. Or at least they appear to.
Section Activities
A typical encounter with section kid goes as follows, stream of consciousness-style:
Average Harvard Student: *So I’m in section for chem, and these polar bonds have got me thinking. In fact, for the past fifty minutes now, I’ve been thinking about how baby polar bears kind of look like puppies. I’m right in front of the TF though, and I really don’t want to look rude pulling out my phone to google baby polar bears. OH YES! We’re doing a “group activity!” Finally some free time so I can relieve myself. Okay, I’m about to pull out my phone, real slick. My table partner is giving me the eye. Whatever man, this is important. Okay, typing it in now: baby polar be-*
Section Kid, at full volume: “WHY ARE YOU ON YOUR PHONE DUDE CAN WE PLEASE IDENTIFY THE POLAR BONDS LIKE OUR TF ASKED?”
Those Damned Colored Pens
One of the telltale signs of a section kid in their natural habitat is their assortment of multicolored writing utensils. Just as the male peacock fans his colorful feathers to attract a potential mate, section kid fans their colorful pens to attract an A from their TF. If you’re looking for a seat, and see an open one next to another student, take a quick peek at their pens. In fact, there’s a simple science to this. One black pen signifies an average student. Add a blue pen, and that student is prepared. Another red pen, and they’re a bit over prepared. Add orange, brown, purple, magenta, aquamarine, sienna, cornflower blue, lemon chiffon, and whatever the hell else and you should probably find a new seat.
Who knows, maybe after reading this, you’ve realized that you’re the section kid! If that’s so, no worries. Just prepare for a life (read: four years) of annoyed stares from your classmates before you shoot off to a successful life. After all, if you’re that prepared at Harvard, you’ll probably do fine in life.
