After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I wrote my review of the first episode of this latest season of the award-winning television series “The Americans,” I commented mostly on the pacing of the episode: it seemed slow, almost too ponderous for a premiere. Episode two, I’m sorry to say, feels much the same. Now, to clarify, “The Americans” has never been a fast-paced show. The series, much like the work of its protagonists, focuses on methodical buildup to an explosive, and often quite satisfying, payoff. This episode has all of the slowness of those episodes but none of the payoff. That is to say, not a lot happens.
We rejoin Philip and Elizabeth as they report to their handler, Gabriel (Frank Langella). Their job at the end of last episode—exhuming the body of deceased sleeper agent William and retrieving a sample of his infected flesh to send back to the U.S.S.R.—went off well, except that fellow agent Hans scraped his hand at the end, risking infection. Elizabeth shot him in the head to prevent a potential outbreak and buried him with William. The report goes well enough; the Jennings pass their pound of flesh to Gabriel, express a moment of sorrow about their fallen comrade, talk about their next mission, and return home.
Here is one of two points in this episode where a plot point moves decisively forward. “The Americans” has always been a show about the tension between the Jennings’ American and Soviet lives: the former embodied by their relationship with their children, the latter by what they do every day. When, late in Season Four, Elizabeth tells Paige what her parents really do, the line between those lives begins to blur. We begin to see the ramifications of this when, upon their return, Elizabeth and Philip see that Paige has fallen asleep curled up in her closet, because that’s the only place she feels safe. Philip is at a loss; Elizabeth resolves to teach her daughter to defend herself.
There are really only a few points of tension left in the show to resolve, and this is one of the most intriguing: How will the Jennings’s children ultimately react to their parents’ occupations? Their parents might be staunch Russian communists—although even that allegiance seems to waver at times—but the children are Americans through and through. Paige’s struggle to reconcile herself to her parents’ identities will likely be one of the dramatic turning points of this season.
The second development of this episode is Elizabeth’s discovery of U.S. research into biological warfare in an unconventional form. On Gabriel’s instruction, the Jennings continue to develop their relationship with a Soviet defector working for the Department of Agriculture. After some sleuthing, Elizabeth finds proof that U.S. agencies are actively working on methods to attack Soviet crops. As multiple characters over the course of the episode aptly point out, a successful assault of this nature would cause death by starvation for millions of Soviets, military and innocent alike.
Despite the nearly glacial tempo of this season, this kind of intrigue is something the show has historically done well. The creator and executive producer may be a former C.I.A. agent, but he seems dedicated to showing how the Cold War really went down, without the rosy glasses of selective listening and incomplete history that gives so many Americans a sense of moral superiority. Indeed, a welcome subplot in this episode continues to track the relationship between F.B.I. agent Stan Beeman and former Soviet “diplomat” Oleg Igorevich Burov (Costa Ronin), as Stan becomes increasingly concerned by his government’s abandonment of moral principles in their pursuit of intelligence. When another operative suggests blackmailing Oleg, Stan replies bluntly that Oleg would be killed for it. The operative doesn’t bat an eye, and in that moment we see Stan’s faith in the system dramatically shaken. This is one of the core themes of the show: America was both victim and aggressor in the Cold War.
“The Americans” has, so far, offered a compelling drama framed by the Cold War: a narrative of shifting alliances, half-truths, and complex moral dilemmas. This season continues to build on the work of the initial seasons, but I have to wonder if the dramatically slowed pace will undercut that success. Last week’s episode was slow, but excusable; premieres are sometimes slowed down so that audiences can reacquaint themselves with characters and settings they may have forgotten. This episode was faster than the premiere, but only on the margins. If they don’t start to speed up, the show may just have to test how compelling its setting can be without accompanying, interesting action. Spoiler: It wouldn’t be that great.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 25, 2017, at 9:00 p.m.
PROVIDENCE, R.I. — Having cracked the NCAA tournament in three consecutive seasons, the Harvard men’s hockey team has grown used to breaking out its dancing shoes. But for the first time in nearly two decades, those shoes aren’t going right back in the closet.
Despite being outshot for just the fifth time this season—by a significant 41-29 margin no less—the top-seeded Crimson outlasted fourth-seeded Providence in a 3-0 affair at the Dunkin’ Donuts Center Friday evening to capture its first NCAA tournament victory in 23 seasons.
“I do think there’s a little bit of relief just to get that first one off our back,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91, who previously had been 0-for-4 in the tournament as a coach. “There was certainly some anxiousness. We really wanted to get that first win.”
“The NCAA tournament [the last two years] left a bitter taste in our mouths,” senior forward Tyler Moy added. “You come so far, have great seasons, but it didn’t really amount to anything…. To get that first one under our belt is something we’ve been working for for a long time. We were coming back for vengeance.”
After a week of stressing the importance of scoring first in an elimination game, the No. 2 Crimson (27-5-2, 16-4-2 ECAC) made good on its plan 1:09 into the second period. With just 17 seconds remaining on the game’s first power play, Moy struck low in the left faceoff circle to give Harvard its first lead at the Big Dance since 2005.
Although Moy had another goal up his sleeve, as did freshman defenseman Adam Fox, that would be all the offense that was necessary. Junior netminder Merrick Madsen made stops left and right throughout the the night, finishing a career-best 41-for-41 between the pipes and willing the Crimson to Saturday night’s East Regional final.
Madsen’s shutout—the fourth he's been a part of this season—comes on the heels of an ECAC championship game where the junior came just 1:17 short of blanking Cornell in what amounted to a 4-1 Harvard victory in Lake Placid. But in that contest, Madsen needed to make just 25 saves; and over the Crimson's first three shutouts, he made an average of only 20 per game.
Friday, Madsen received about a third of that amount of shots in less than four minutes. The No. 13 Friars (22-12-5, 12-7-3 Hockey East) took the game to the Crimson early, playing “a little faster than [Harvard was] accustomed to,” per Donato.
Providence peppered the junior netminder with 17 shots in the opening frame, including a number of scoring opportunities from the doorstep—much like Boston College came up with in the first period of the Crimson’s 2016 tournament opener. But this time, Madsen held his ground.
“They had that big first flurry at the start of the first period, and in a way, I felt like that got me into the game a lot easier than it would’ve had I not gotten any shots,” Madsen said. “Obviously we don’t want to be giving up a ton of chances like that early on, but I think as a team we calibrated, and we took it to them the rest of the period. And obviously we took it to them the rest of the game.”
Madsen was technically beaten once, but only after a whistle was blown. Late in the opening period, sophomore top-liner Erik Foley picked the top corner of the net off the rush to potentially give the Friars a 1-0 edge. However, the referees blew the play dead a second prior, deeming that Providence had been offsides when entering the zone—a call that proved erroneous on replay.
“The referees are human—we’re all human,” said Providence coach Nate Leaman, a Harvard assistant coach from 1999 to 2003. “To win a national championship, you know you’re going to have to get some bounces along the way, and I thought Harvard got a bounce there.”
Maintaining the ability to score first as it had planned all along, the Crimson took advantage after Providence sophomore Scott Conway tripped up Moy with 34 seconds remaining in the first period.
At the outset of the second frame, Moy—just one step from the boards near the bottom of the left circle—unleashed a short-side wrister that snuck inside sophomore Hayden Hawkey’s right post, handing the Crimson a 1-0 lead.
“I actually didn’t see very much of the net; there was a defenseman there,” Moy said. “I thought when the puck came across the ice that the goalie might not be set yet. So I just decided to throw it on net.”
After Moy’s decision paid off, sophomore forward Ryan Donato came inches from doubling the lead with 2:14 remaining in the same period. But after dangling down the slot, the Ivy League Player of the Year’s shot flew off off the crossbar.
Shortly thereafter, Donato fell to the ice behind the net. But with the puck still within arm’s reach, the Boston Bruins draft pick extended his stick to will the puck in the general direction of Fox, who took the pass off the cage and beat Hawkey on the doorstep.
Fox’s goal—just the sixth of the season for the ECAC’s Rookie of the Year—came less than a minute after Harvard killed one of four Providence power plays on the night. The Friars generated two of those man advantages in the final period—albeit one was less than a minute in length—but Providence just could not find the keys to solve Madsen.
“It’s tough to be disappointed with the way we played tonight,” Leaman said. “I thought we played a terrific game. We had a lot of great chances, and I thought we got the looks we wanted…. The puck just didn’t go in the net for us.”
Moy added an empty-netter with 1:51 remaining to close the book on the 3-0 scoreline, officially securing the first win in three tournament tries for the Crimson’s veterans.
“We felt like we had a really good team last year and the year before, and we weren’t able to get that first win,” Donato said. “They’ll all be difficult, but the first one is a great credit to the leadership in the locker room. I think they wanted it. I don’t feel like they felt the pressure maybe as much as their coach to get that first one.”
Now that the pressure of avoiding an eighth-straight first-round exit is off, the Crimson—now a winner of 15 consecutive games—can turn its attention to Saturday night’s regional final, where a spot in the Frozen Four will be up for grabs. Harvard will play third-seeded Air Force, who topped second-seeded Western Michigan, 5-4, in Friday's second semifinal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 25, 2017, at 9:00 p.m.
PROVIDENCE, R.I. — All streaks—good or bad—must come to an end. It’s just a matter of when. For the Harvard men’s hockey team, Friday evening’s 3-0 win over Providence continued a positive streak while ending an undesirable one.
The Crimson’s quest for a Division I title began with an East Regional semifinal matchup played in the Friars’ hometown. The weekend matinee saw No. 2 Harvard (27-6-2, 16-4-2 ECAC) win its 15th consecutive game, halting a period of more than two decades without an NCAA tournament victory.
No. 13 Providence (22-12-5, 12-7-3 HEA), although just the fifth team to outshoot Harvard all season, exits NCAA bracket play in the first round for a second consecutive year. The Friars, two seasons removed from a Division I crown of their own, came out hard and peppered Harvard junior goaltender Merrick Madsen with shot after shot in the contest’s opening minutes. The effective home team in Friday’s game, however, did not receive the calls, the bounces, or the goals necessary to advance.
“We’re very happy and excited to move on,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “[The Friars] certainly had stretches of the game where they carried the play. I thought they worked hard; they were physical.”
The Crimson has now captured five straight victories against Providence, despite the last meeting between the two teams occurring over three decades ago.
VICTORY AT LAST
Since Harvard’s NCAA Championship season in 1989, the Crimson had won just a single tournament game, coming at the expense of New Hampshire in 1994. But Donato, the Most Outstanding Player of the tournament during the ’89 run, captured an elusive Division I playoff win in his fifth attempt behind the Harvard bench Friday.
Entering its clash with the Friars, the Crimson had been bounced from tournament play in the Regional semifinals in seven straight appearances.
“To get that first one under our belt is something we’ve been working for, for a long time,” senior forward Tyler Moy said. “We’ve got a great thing going with our team here, and I think we’re looking forward to the opportunity to continue.”
More recently, Harvard’s offense in the NCAA Tournament—or the lack thereof— has been one of the primary causes of the team’s inability to make it out of the round of 16. The Crimson had mustered just a single goal in each of its previous three appearances in the NCAA playoff, bowing out to Boston College last year, Nebraska-Omaha in 2015, and Maine in 2006.
What’s more: Harvard had not scored the first goal in an NCAA Tournament game since Ryan Maki ’07 opened the scoring in the team’s 2005 overtime loss to New Hampshire.
But Friday evening, courtesy of Moy, the Crimson enjoyed playing with its first lead in a Division I tournament game in over a decade. With the score notched at zeros, Moy caught Providence goalie Hayden Hawkey out of position and bulged the twine on the power play.
With the East semifinal win, Harvard ties a program record with 15 straight wins—a mark set by the 1989 championship team.
MADSEN PLAYING LIKE A MADMAN
After enduring the throws of a goaltending battle last season, netminder Merrick Madsen entered his junior campaign with a stranglehold on the starting role. And he hasn’t looked back. The Crimson has ridden Madsen’s strong play—evidenced by a .938 save percentage and a 1.67 goals against average since Jan. 20—to a historic 17-game unbeaten streak.
A recurring storyline of late, the Acton, Calif., native put forth yet another solid performance Friday against Providence, as he recorded a career-high 41 saves to get his third shutout of the season.
The Friars certainly controlled the game for various stretches, and the Harvard skaters relied heavily on their brick wall to bail them out. After Madsen fended off Providence’s barrage of shots at the outset of the contest, including a sequence of stuff-attempts from within five feet of the net, he appeared locked in for the remainder of the game.
Just when the Friars seemed to be tilting the ice, Madsen’s crucial stops snuffed any Providence momentum and allowed his team to establish dominant stretches of its own.
“I just think we had something on our side,” Madsen said. “And I think that made it easier for everyone.”
The Crimson’s record holder for consecutive wins—a mark now at 15 games—has accrued honors and accolades all season, as his importance to the team becomes more evident with each start.
With last weekend’s ECAC semifinal victory, Madsen became Harvard’s all-time leader in single-season wins, eclipsing the 24-win mark set by Grant Blair ’86. After earning another tick in the win column Friday, the Philadelphia Flyers prospect maintains the highest winning percentage in Division I, as he is responsible for all 34 Harvard decisions this season, leading to a 27-5-2 record.
During the championship rounds of the ECAC tournament, Madsen rejected 50 of 52 shots thrown his way en route to receiving Most Outstanding Player and all-tournament team honors. On top of these conference playoff distinctions, the all-Ivy League first-teamer was a finalist for the Ken Dryden ECAC Hockey Goaltender of the Year Award and a semifinalist for the Mike Richter Award, given to Division I’s premier puck stopper.
“I think it starts with the goaltender,” Donato said. “He’s made some big saves at key times.”
Madsen was also considered for the Walter Brown Award, bestowed upon the best American-born college hockey player in the New England area.
After Friday evening’s Regional semifinal showing, Madsen now ranks 13th in the nation in save percentage (.922), while his goals against average (2.12) places him 12th among Division I netminders. Over the course of Harvard’s 17-game unbeaten streak, Madsen ranks fifth in each category.
Madsen’s whitewash of Providence marks the 11th game this season in which the Crimson’s go-to tender has saved at least 95 percent of the opposition’s shots. Madsen has now sent away at least 30 attempts in eight games to date.
EARLY LEAD? LET’S KEEP IT THAT WAY
In the lead-up to Friday’s tournament opener, Harvard talked extensively about one of its primary goals being to net the game’s first score. Donato and his squad knew that, in a single-elimination format like that of the NCAA Tournament, there is little opportunity to rectify early mistakes.
“It’s not a three-game series where if you have a bad night, you can make it up,” Moy said. “It was going to be important to start fast and start hard, so grabbing that first goal is something we focused on all week.”
In the game’s opening minutes, it looked as though Harvard might struggle to achieve this objective. The Friars were flying into the Crimson zone off the rush and saw some grade-A scoring chances early in the contest. In fact, Providence notched eight of the game’s first 10 shots on goal.
Nevertheless, thanks to Madsen’s strong play and a few favorable bounces and calls—namely a potential Providence goal negated for offside—Harvard was able to stave off this early Friars attack.
Besides the obvious desire to own the advantage whenever possible, the Crimson’s track record with the lead this season explains why potting the game’s first goal was so important.
Harvard entered Friday’s game with a 19-2-0 record when scoring first. Plus, the East Regional’s top seed had been 18-1-0 on the year with a lead after one period and a perfect 21-0-0 with a lead after two. More generally, Harvard has lost just three games all season in which it led at any point in the contest.
The Crimson’s “play with the lead” mentality was of particular note also because, until Tyler Moy’s second-period man-up tally, Harvard had not possessed a lead in an NCAA Tournament game since 2005.
This season, the Crimson has opened the scoring in 22 of 34 games and has done so in all but two contests during its 15-game win streak.
