After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Having chosen to study abroad my junior spring, I haven’t been on Harvard’s campus in eight months. I am pleased to report that I really did miss it—the hustle and bustle of the square, late-night runs to Tasty Burger, reading a book by the river, even taking an English class with one of my favorite professors. As happy as I am to return, however, choosing to study abroad for a semester was one of the best decisions I have made in a long while.
As I prepared for my impending semester in Spain, I was filled with doubts about leaving Harvard’s campus. Knowing how much Harvard has to offer its students, I was worried that being away from campus would rob me of certain resources or decelerate my academic momentum. I wondered if I had been naive not to follow in the footsteps of those who passed on a semester abroad for fear of “missing out.” By my junior fall, I had guzzled the Harvard Kool-Aid, and I wasn’t ready to trade it in for anything—even world-famous Spanish sangria.
Looking back, however, I am beyond grateful that I made the trade. When I toured Harvard for the first time as a senior in high school, I was told on multiple occasions that Harvard was a microcosm of the real world. And in many ways, it is. Harvard strives to create a community of diverse individuals from all walks of life who possess a vast array of interests and talents. But this community is also self-selecting, and the people who surround me at Harvard tend to share certain commonalities that are sure to be scarce once I take my final steps through Johnston Gate this May.
Confining oneself to Harvard’s campus alone, therefore, can often lead to tunnel vision. It prompts students to make untrue assumptions about life outside the Harvard community. Eight months ago, I was guilty of viewing Harvard as a standard for intellect and a haven for the world’s best and brightest. It only took one trip to a run-down hostel in London, where I met a man who knew more about current affairs than many of the Harvard students I’ve encountered, for me to realize that intellect comes in many forms.
I was also quick to assume eight months ago that—because I had trotted the globe with family and student groups—I knew what the world was like. What I have come to realize since studying abroad, however, is that people are a reflection of their environments, and the best way to get to know a place is to get to know its people. No matter how many times I visited the Plaza de España in Seville (arguably the city’s most famous site), I came to truly understand the city by sipping tinto de verano in the afternoons with local Spanish students. And the fact remains that this essential aspect of “getting to know” Seville would have been impossible had I stayed on Harvard’s campus, or even visited the city in a different context.
So, while I have learned and continue to learn many valuable insights during my time in college, these insights only occasionally pertain to the world outside of Harvard. Harvard is a microcosm of the real world in the same way that McDonald’s is a microcosm of the food industry—there are some accurate comparisons, but the two are by no means interchangeable.
This is not to say that students need to study abroad in order to expand their horizons. There are plenty of ways to broaden one’s worldview beyond the streets of Cambridge. For those who decide to stay here, I encourage you to talk to people on the streets or the local barista at your favorite coffee shop. What he or she has to say is just as valuable as what the student sitting next to you in section can share. What’s more, although the opportunities at Harvard seem somewhat limitless, students don’t have to settle for seizing these opportunities alone. Instead of writing a thesis, I have opted to write a book on my own time, and I could not be more content with my decision.
Of course, I still drink the Harvard Kool-Aid, and I’m proud to do so. But while I’m sipping, I remember to keep in mind that life outside of Harvard exists, and it’s richer and more diverse than any one community.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was the fall of 2012. A choking waft of liberalism filled the air as eager freshmen lined their windowsills with blue Obama posters. And as I stood in the middle of the yard, drowning in this sea of cerulean, only one phrase rang loudly in my head: “You’re gonna come back a liberal.”
I superstitiously began wearing my Texas necklace everyday to ward away liberal spirits. A Bush-Cheney bumper sticker was hidden away in my desk drawer—a false reassurance that I was not abandoning my roots. And to prove that I was just as politically inclined as my new Harvard peers, I got hold of a Romney poster…which was proudly displayed under a stack of textbooks in the corner of my common room.
I was the ultimate closet Republican.
Or at least for four days I was. Lured in at the Activities Fair by the “Behind Enemy Lines Since 1888” shirts and a Reagan-red election map, I found myself copying my new Harvard email address onto the GOP-open mailing list. And just like that, I began my new college life as a member of the Harvard Republican Club.
At the time, the HRC was at the forefront of right-of-center politics on campus. But then there was also The Salient. And Right to Life. And the Libertarian Forum. Every day, it seemed like I was peeling away the blue and being made more and more aware of a vibrant, thriving right-leaning community at Harvard. In my confusion, I returned to my original equations: First, college equals liberal. Second, Harvard equals college. I was never very good at math, but even I could reach the logical conclusion: Harvard equals liberal. Why would we be an exception?
In one way, I was right. Harvard is undoubtedly one of the most liberal colleges in America. But in more important ways, I was very wrong. We are absolutely exceptional. After all, only Harvard has the honor of housing the oldest college Republican Club in the world—125 years and counting. And we can thank the school’s liberal petri dish for spawning in reaction so many different right-of-center groups that accept all people in whatever shades of red (or in some cases purplish-blue) they come in.
In fact, it is Harvard’s left-leaning bias itself that has created an environment extremely conducive to the growth of a very unique kind of community—one that strives to bring together individuals in the hopes of embodying a stronger, more cohesive vision for political diversity. Harvard may be a liberal college, but its extremely blue existence is not mutually exclusive to, nor is it in any way diluted by, an undeniable existence of a strong Republican Harvard.
If you are reading this, chances are I really do not have to convince you why you need to be a Republican. What I do need to convince you, however, is why you should be a Harvard Republican. Michael Bloomberg in his 2014 Harvard commencement address made the point that “a liberal arts education must not be an education in the art of liberalism.” His admonition was not directed solely at Harvard professors and administrators. We students have a responsibility to those around us, and to our beliefs themselves, to proudly broadcast our views via vehicles like the HRC. At a campus like Harvard, it is easy for a Republican feel on the fringe. But we believe in real values and ideals that are held by roughly half in this country, and to even temporarily abandon them is to lessen the greatness and diversity that is Harvard.
Some of you might already know that you want to get involved with Republican activities on campus, and I applaud you for your strength of conviction. But I know that there will be a greater number of you who, like me, will be wary of branding yourself so early in your college careers. To this I say, do not write Harvard off easily. We as Republicans, or for that matter anyone holding a minority viewpoint on this campus, should not fall into a habit of complaining about lack of open-mindedness before testing the bounds of inclusivity on which Harvard prides itself. Give your fellow Harvardians a chance, and they might just surprise you.
Two years ago, I thought I feared the people around me, and even more so, I thought I feared the ramifications of my own political beliefs. The same deafening roar kept ringing through my head: “You’re gonna come back a liberal.”
But soon enough, even that horrid noise was toned out by an overwhelming sense of calm. You know, the one that finally said, “Welcome to Harvard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
High school is a thing of the past for college students, with most of those turbulent times thankfully behind us. But one trend that persists, even at Harvard, is the clique.
Many assume that cliques do not exist in college, associating them with the hip, judgmental, Regina George-esque sass-mouthers that create a culture of hierarchal popularity.
To clarify, I don’t mean clique in the traditional sense of social elitism here. I mean it as a social group consisting of your closest, most supportive friends.
There is a chance that by becoming a part of a clique, you stymie your chance to socialize, all because some prefer 10 close friends to scores of acquaintances.
On opening days and throughout freshman fall, proctors, PAFs, and upperclassmen will tell you to go out and meet as many people as you can. “Don’t compare, connect,” they will tell you.
Find out who likes the same sports teams as you do or digs cooking lo mein instead of looking for those who interned at the White House or helped dig a well for a village in Belize and trying to figure what it is that you can do to get ahead.
And don’t worry so much about academics at first. Taking the hardest classes is great, but what if you find a problem set impossible to do? Or find studying for a particular exam overwhelming? Or see yourself slipping into depression the first few weeks you are here because you are not performing at the level you wanted?
Where do you go for help, comfort, and solace?
At some point, you are going to have to find a place where you can open yourself to others. By having your foot in the door of 10 organizations, you may not be able to commit enough of yourself to any of them to foster a strong relationship.
This is why cliques are important. Stick to people that make you feel good about yourself and what you have accomplished, not people who make you think what you are doing is simply not enough. In fact, this abyssal desire to keep striving for perfection is why so many Harvard students fall into depression.
It is human nature to be attracted and to feel comfortable with people who are most like you. This is why friends and relationships are two things cliques provide immediately. These people will be the ones you spend the most time outside of classes with. These people give a sense of belonging and comfort in all parts of life, whether it is academics, religion, or hobbies.
With culture and religion come dietary restrictions, congregations, holidays, and observances. Often, cultural organizations become the primary social circle for many students because they can relate to others in the circle, talk to them about their problems, and figure how to get around them within cultural or religious limits.
Cliques can help you learn so much. If you do not connect with these people, you may have to learn things the hard way, through experience. In fact, you already give yourself a head start by talking to upperclassmen in these cliques and groups about the dos and don’ts of freshman year and Harvard.
I am not saying don’t socialize. But find what groups speak to your passions and needs. Get to know those people and build a relationship in which they are your go-to people for anything and everything. Treat them as family because they really are your family away from home.
My advice is so cliché, yet some students take years to grasp its essence: Do not give heed to those who make you feel bad and find those you make your day every day.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Compost bins have finally made their way to Harvard Yard. The addition of a few bins might seem insignificant, but the new bins are the product of committed student advocacy over the course of last semester. The efforts to bring compost bins to freshmen dorms show how student efforts can tangibly improve the University.
Compostable waste accounts for approximately 30 percent of the garbage Harvard students produce. Yet until this year, Harvard freshmen could only send their garbage to a landfill or a recycling center. This was a wasted opportunity, as compost can do everything from conserving much-needed space in landfills to minimizing airborne pollution.
Not only is this initiative a step in the right direction, but it also demonstrates that environmentalism can be a part of students’ daily lives. The new compost bins simply add another option to the recycling and general trash bins that Harvard freshmen are already responsible for taking out. The composted material eventually makes its way to organic farms that supply Harvard University Dining Services with produce.
It is particularly heartening to see this example originating in the freshmen dorms, where the youngest and newest members of our community live. One of the great things about colleges is that their cultures can easily progress and evolve, because every year a quarter of the population leaves while a new quarter takes its place. For this reason, every year presents an opportunity for significant improvement in the way the community sees specific issues, including environmental conservation. We hope that the placement of compost bins in the freshmen dorms encourages the class of 2018 to reflect more on their consumption. Promoting a culture of sustainability in the freshmen class is the first step toward changing the culture in the college overall. Better yet, the initiative adopted an open, constructive approach, and the College to its credit cooperated to support the rollout.
While composting initiatives already exist at the Law School and through HUDS, the University should go further encourage other areas of Harvard to follow suit. The most obvious next step would be to extend the composting scheme to the upperclassmen Houses at the College, and from there to other schools at Harvard.
In the words of Cliff F. W. Goertemiller ’17, co-head of Green ’17, the group that spearheaded the initiative, “The ultimate goal would be that every single dorm suite at Harvard would have a compost bin.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After starting off the season with two comeback victories over Santa Clara and Central Connecticut State at the Harvard Invitational Tournament, the Harvard women’s volleyball team could not pull off the weekend sweep, falling behind early to Delaware on Saturday.
“We learned a lot about ourselves as a team this weekend,” junior Caroline Holte said. “[We learned] a lot of things to improve when we come back to the gym on Monday.”
DELAWARE 3, HARVARD 0
Just as had been true the night before, the Crimson (2-1) trailed its opponent by two sets entering the third frame. But unlike on Friday, Harvard did not storm back and take the final three sets—instead, it fell to the Blue Hens, 3-0, on Saturday evening.
“Tonight we didn’t respond to [Delaware’s] quicker attack,” coach Jennifer Weiss said. “They had a good read on us blocking-wise.”
After falling behind, 24-21, in the first set, the Crimson took the next two points to get within one. But a kill from Chandler Bryant secured the first frame for Delaware (4-3) and set the tone for the rest of the evening.
In the next set, the Crimson found itself in a crucial spot, tied, 23-23, with a chance to even the contest. But a kill from Jill Meyers and a block by Chandler Bryant gave the Blue Hens a two-set lead and, eventually, the matchup.
HARVARD 3, CENTRAL CONNECTICUT STATE 0
Despite a solid effort from a winless squad, the Crimson managed to pull away from the Blue Devils in straight sets, 3-0.
Down by five in the second set, Harvard won six consecutive points, including three kills from sophomore Corinne Bain, who also added 29 assists in the winning effort. After a service error and an attack error by the Crimson allowed the Blue Devils (0-6) to take a one-point lead, Harvard rallied off three straight points, including the clincher on a kill from Bain to take the second set, 28-26.
The Crimson would not let Central Connecticut State back into the game. Behind 20 assists from junior Kathleen Wallace and 13 kills from Holte, the Crimson put away the Blue Devils in the third and final set of the game, 25-21, to remain unbeaten on the season.
Harvard also stole a late lead in the first frame from Central Connecticut State. Trailing by three, 22-19, Harvard would not allow the Blue Devils to score again. Propelled by a service ace from sophomore Grace Weghorst and kills from juniors Jennifer Shults, Wallace, and Holte, Harvard surged to steal the first set, 25-22.
“We came back in the end,” Holte said. “But we need to start strong in the first ten points.”
HARVARD 3, SANTA CLARA 2
Going into the third set without a win against an undefeated Santa Clara squad, the Crimson staged a comeback in front of its home crowd, emerging victorious in five sets in the season opener, 3-2.
“I think in the beginning…we were just getting the jitters out,” Weiss said. “We were definitely a little tight. Santa Clara is a great team.”
The Crimson fell behind, 3-1, in the final frame of the game but surged to win eight of the next 11 points, taking a lead that it never surrendered. Just as Santa Clara (6-1) started to sneak back into the game, a kill by Holte secured the final set, 15-13.
Behind 13 kills from Sabrina Clayton and 22 digs from Danielle Rottman, Santa Clara pounced on the Crimson in the first two sets, winning the frames by eight and seven points, respectively.
After the flat first two sets, the Crimson responded to the influx of energy from the home supporters in the third, winning the final three frames. Weghorst led Harvard with 15 kills, helped in large part by Bain, who dished out 27 assists in the game.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After entering the year with high expectations, the Harvard men’s soccer team (0-2-0) went winless on its first road trip of the year, losing in tight matches against No. 9 Georgetown (1-0-2) and George Washington (2-1-0). The Crimson led for just eight minutes across both games.
GEORGE WASHINGTON 2, HARVARD 1
On Sunday, the Crimson avoided falling into an early hole by dominating the offensive end in the first half. The Crimson had 11 shots in the first period, allowing just two, and notched nine corner kicks along the way. Harvard had three shots in the first six minutes but ultimately could not convert until early in the second half, when captain Kyle Henderson knocked in a header off an assist from sophomore forward Daniel Smith.
George Washington quickly fought back, scoring a corner kick just eight minutes later. After sophomore Spiros Tsakos sent the corner into the box, a foul gave the Colonials a penalty kick attempt. Junior Jonny Forrest knocked the ball into the right corner of the net to equalize the game.
Forrest was not done for the day. In the next 25 minutes, George Washington had just one other shot before the forward put the team on his back. Corralling a through ball from junior Philip McQuitty in front of the goal, Forrest beat a Crimson defender before blasting a shot into the bottom left corner of the net for the deciding score of the contest.
Harvard, which outshot the Colonials by a 21-8 count over the course of the game, could not manage a shot in the final minutes, losing its second straight game.
GEORGETOWN 2, HARVARD 0
The last time Harvard squared off against a nationally ranked opponent, the Crimson did not stand a chance, falling to then-No. 4 Connecticut, 6-0.
Two years later, Harvard has a new kind of team. Although the result was the same—a loss to No. 9 Georgetown, 2-0—the Crimson proved that it can compete against the best in its 2014 season opener.
“There were a ton of positives we can take out of the game,” junior co-captain Mark Ashby said. “We really feel like we were able to hang with them and probably any other team in the nation. We feel really confident now.”
After falling behind in the 12th minute, Harvard settled into the contest, staving off the Hoyas’ attack for the majority of the game. Georgetown recorded a whopping 21 shots but could only get five of them on net.
“If you just look at the shots, it looks like we got pounded, but I can really only think of three or four chances where they had good opportunities to score,” Ashby said. “I was really impressed with the whole back line. They did a really good job of holding it down.”
Crimson coach Pieter Lehrer said that the major aim of the back line was shutting down the Hoyas’ two top forwards, sophomore Alex Muyl and junior Brandon Allen. The attacking duo combined to tally 15 goals and 14 assists last season, but Harvard held them to just one shot on goal on Sunday.
The defensive effort, however, would not be enough, as Georgetown’s goal in the early stages of the game proved to be all the host would need. Following two early shots on net from the Hoyas, senior midfielder Tyler Rudy finally broke through with a strike from the top of the box that got past Crimson goalkeeper Evan Mendez.
From then on, Georgetown could only muster two more shots on goal, but one of them sealed the deal for the Hoyas. With less than five minutes to go, freshman midfielder Arun Basuljevic caught Harvard too far in the attacking zone, slipping through the defense and adding an insurance goal from the left side of the pitch.
Prior to the second Georgetown goal, the Crimson had its share of opportunities to level the score, the first of which came just minutes after the Hoyas got on the board. After receiving a throw-in thirty yards into the attacking half, Harvard called on junior attacker Michael Klain.
Klain, a throw-in specialist, delivered a towering ball into the box, which junior defender Philip Fleischman redirected toward Ashby. The co-captain got his head behind the ball and sent a shot flying toward the net, but it skipped just past the post.
“We’re really serious about our throws and set pieces,” Ashby said. “That can be one of our serious assets throughout the year offensively to generate a lot of goals.”
Freshman forward Tyler Savitsky also had several scoring opportunities in his first collegiate contest. After coming on as a substitute in the 63rd minute, the rookie added a much-needed spark to the Crimson offense, recording all three of the team’s shots on net for the game.
“[Savitsky] was very, very good when he came in,” Lehrer said. “The goalie just made great saves on his shots.”
Despite the result, Lehrer was happy with the performance.
“We played very well, and they’re a very good team,” Lehrer said. “There’s going to be very few teams in the nation that will be able to hold them to five shots on goal…. I think we’re going to be very difficult to handle.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s golf team opened its fall season this weekend with an eighth-place tie among 11 teams at the Wolverine Intercollegiate tournament in Ann Arbor, Mich.
After two days of play, the Crimson climbed from ninth place place to tie Xavier by the end of the third round. While Harvard did not face any Ivy League competitors, the challenging field proved to be stiff competition for the team. The University of Michigan and Pennsylvania State University finished at the top of the field, placing first and second, respectively.
“The results were not exactly what we wanted nor where I think where our level is,” coach Kevin Rhoads said. “I definitely liked what I saw in terms of what we could do with what we had. The guys really stayed in it well…[but] we’re just not quite sharp yet. We just need to continue what we’ve been doing, and if we do I will be pretty comfortable with where we end up.”
The University of Michigan Golf Course, considered among the best collegiate golf courses in the country, featured 6,704 yards for 18 holes and a par of 71.
“This is a course that is not overly long but required local knowledge and much more strategy,” Rhoads said. “We were definitely trying to incorporate that when we saw the course during the practice round, but we got more used to it as we played. If we go back next year, I will like our chances even better than they were this year.”
Michigan started strong in the first round of the tournament and took the lead early with a score of 278 strokes, six under par. The Wolverines continued to dominate the course through the second and third rounds for a total of 845, seven under par.
A strong third round contributed most to the Crimson’s jump from ninth to eighth place, in which Harvard was able to reduce its overall score by 20 strokes, to a five-over-par mark of 289.
“Every day we got better,” Rhoads said. “We made better decisions and the scores went down so everything was quite good, and we will try to get better.”
In the individual competition, Michigan’s Kyle Mueller claimed the tournament champion title. Mueller ended round three with a score of 206, seven under par and just one stroke ahead of runner-up Cody Blick of San Jose State University. Mueller’s teammate Chris O’Neill led the tournament’s individual standings until the third round, when he shot seven-over to fall to sixth.
Harvard junior Rohan Ramnath was the highest-placing Crimson entrant, placing 31st with a score of 219. Ramnath hit seven birdies and 35 even pars over three rounds. Scoring one stroke over him to tie for 32nd place was Harvard sophomore Kendrick Vinar, who hit the Crimson’s only eagle of the tournament in addition to ten birdies.
“Our coach imparts this philosophy of controllable factors and focusing on the things that we can control,” sophomore Kendrick Vinar said. “I tried to work on this all week, and I was really pleased today. I think it’s a good perspective because if you do all the things that are in your control the best you can, you get to walk away regret-free.”
Sophomore Daniel De La Garza and captain Akash Mirchandani tied for 47th place, each exceeding par by 10 for a total score of 223. Both earned a score of two-over 71 in the third round.
“We were excited to get our season underway and we came here looking to test our game,” Vinar said. “A lot of us haven’t played a ton of golf over the summer, so we just wanted to get out there, assess the level of our game, and focus on our process. I think all of us are leaving this weekend with a lot of positive things to take away and a better idea of what we need to work on for the future.”
