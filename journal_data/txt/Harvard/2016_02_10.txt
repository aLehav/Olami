After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Secret messages can be found all over Taylor Swift’s work, from the “random” capitalizations in her CD booklets to the sometimes not-so-subtle hints in her song lyrics. Her music video for her song “Out of the Woods” is no different. In this video, Swift frantically flees through land, ice, and fire as a pack of vicious wolves chase her. These wolves are relentless, and they seem to have a message for Swift—or perhaps a message for everyone. They are telling Swift not to go out of the woods but to return to them. “Out of the Woods” is a call to action, starting with the realization that modernity has taken over nature. By displaying a variety of beautiful, natural settings erupting in cataclysmic events set to an anxiety-filled song, this music video reminds audiences that time is running out.
0:00

We receive the first clue within three seconds: “She lost him.” Or is it “She lost Him?” Swift alludes to Genesis 1, The Beginning, when God created the universe and introduced vegetation, seas, animals, and other natural creatures to the world—and laments that the apparent obsession with iPhones and iPads of today has made the people lose their connection with the Earth and with what He or the Earth created.
1:02

A minute into the music video, we find that Swift is being chased by wolves. The undomesticated creatures are symbols of the natural world warning people of the consequences to come.
1:22
The wolves tear Swift’s dress, which appears to be machine-made and serves as another symbol of the dominance of man and technology. They encourage Swift—if a bit forcefully—to return to her natural roots and opt for organic, environmentally-friendly clothing that can be created without the use of an electricity-draining machine.
1:45
Finally understanding the message, Swift grabs her necklace—another man-made product—and tosses it off a cliff. She rids herself of these unnatural products of the modern age.
2:31
An ice storm helps with her transition, shattering the most obviously artificial layers of her dress.
2:54
Initially, Swift struggles to accept the new lifestyle she must lead to stop the pervasive spread of modernity. The woods hold her back, reminding her to not succumb to technology’s luxurious benefits.
3:35
Swift finally embraces the truth. She is at peace with the wolves, the woods, and the Earth.

In 2001, indie neo-psych outfit Dr. Dog self-released their debut, a concept album called “The Psychedelic Swamp.” After 15 years of honing their craft, they’ve returned to their samizdat, and they released the now professionally produced “Psychedelic Swamp” on ANTI- Records on Feb. 5. It’s easy to see why they decided “Swamp” deserved a revisit: Its 13 songs burst with excellent and surprising musical ideas, and intriguing, if sometimes inscrutable, lyrics to boot. With its clever self-awareness, melodicism, and creativity, “Swamp” warrants purchase and multiple listens: Each one uncovers new clever complexities hidden in its unassuming vocals and seemingly simple song structures.
“The Psychedelic Swamp” is, well, psychedelic: The album, especially the songs with “swamp” in the title, is saturated with such staples of the genre as ocean sound effects, shrieks, synth crescendoes, and echoing vocals. Rather than bogging down the album in atmospherics, these touches are artful and focused, giving the album a trippiness amplified by the fuzzy, dissociated body horror lyrics of the consecutive “Holes in My Back” and “Fire on My Back.” That the album’s story, if there is one, takes place in a swamp only adds to the pleasant haziness. As in any good concept album, the concept is a focusing unifier, not a gimmick. It might be an excessively positive comparison, but “Swamp” has much in common with “Pet Sounds”: initials, a quirky theme reinforced by sound effects, vocal harmony suites, ambitious and memorable chord progressions, and even lyrics, like “here today, gone tomorrow” on “Badvertise.”
To be clear, “The Psychedelic Swamp” is not “Pet Sounds”; in 2016, it doesn’t break any new ground, nor does it try. Its lyrics are marked by familiar indie self-consciousness, not confessional angst, and its vocal harmonies aren’t Beach Boys-dazzling. In short, it is not a perfect album. It is, however, very compelling. In all but a few sequences, “Swamp” is exciting, challenging music. If the album has weak patches, they are the “concept” songs like “Swamp Descent” and “(swamp inflammation).”  Although unspectacular, they do give the album structure by serving as pleasant respites from the attention-demanding highlights. Indeed, one of the best elements of “Swamp” is its sequencing. Neither the druggy grooves like “Engineer Says,” the minimalist laments like “In Love,” nor the upbeat Strokesian rock like “Dead Record Player” wear on the listener, in part because they share the album’s space so effectively.
Of course, in defending a 4.5-star rating, praising structure and conceptual coherence only goes so far. Good—i.e., non-generic—psychedelia needs hooks, not just atmosphere, and Dr. Dog obliges. From the simple, buzzy guitar line that begins “Golden Hide,” the album opener, “Swamp” is catchy and accessible. Particular highlights are the poppier, (read: less swampy), tracks “Bring My Baby Back” and “Good Grief,” each of which boast emotive vocals and a stellar chorus, and the darkly groovy “Engineer Says.” In fact, every track save for the swampiest songs has a strong melody, a rare feat. This discipline is especially surprising considering the album’s background as a garage-recorded debut. These 15-year-old songs are certainly as strong as those on Dr. Dog’s 2013 “B-Room.”
Psychedelia might not be as relevant in 2016 as it was in its heyday, and “The Psychedelic Swamp” is unabashedly retro. But even if catchy tunes and disciplined production are out of style, “Swamp” is tremendously enjoyable. A triumph of the genre, “The Psychedelic Swamp” sets a high bar for the broader worlds of indie and popular music.

While Rihanna has dominated the radio and clubs for more than a decade, in her new album “Anti” she purposefully shifts away from her previous classic pop style to a tougher and more uncompromising sound. As its title suggests, “Anti” goes against fans’ expectations by reintroducing Rihanna in a more vulnerable light, adding nuance to her seductive and brooding persona. With no pop or pomp to hide behind, both Rihanna and her voice are as naked as they’ve ever been, ironically revealing the “Skin” she sang about previously on her fifth album  “Loud” (“No heels/ No shirt/No skirt/ All I'm in is just skin.”) Unexpected and almost overwhelming, Rihanna’s bare, haunting, and risky eighth studio album serves as a tinted yet translucent window into her personal life.
As usual, Rihanna’s voice is the beacon guiding listeners through the haze of smoke that fills her music and surrounds her life. Her voice fluctuates between defiant and indignant (“Consideration”), melancholy (“Desperado”), emotional (“Higher”), and playful (“Work”). Rihanna achieves this incredible range by incorporating elements from different cultures, times, and artists into her music. She uses Jamaican patois in “Work” to enunciate syllables that don’t quite seem to end (“When you ah guh / ...Meh nuh cyar if him”) in a sort of response to Drake’s “Hotline Bling”—Drake incidentally is featured on this song. Rihanna also pulls musical motifs from the past, evoking ‘80s rock with an introductory guitar solo in “Kiss It Better” and ‘60s soul, with “Higher” and “Love on the Brain.”  Her cover of Tame Impala’s “New Person, Same Old Mistakes” (here titled “Same Ol’ Mistakes”), while not the most original take on the song, also demonstrates her willingness to work with other artists and styles of music outside of her domain.This new exploration is perhaps an attempt at satisfying her desire to make more enduring music. “I don't want to perform a lot of my songs because they don't feel like me, so I want to make songs that are timeless" she stated In an interview with MTV. It’s a statement that reflects her reflects her newfound determination to take control of her music and career. Just three albums ago, on “Loud” (2010), Rihanna had no writing credits: Now, she is credited as a songwriter on all the original songs on “Anti.” She points out her new resolve in opening track “Consideration,” an explicit warning to the world that she will do what she feels is right for herself (“I got to do things my own way darling / Will you ever let me? / Will you ever respect me? No”), ironically setting the tone for an even more unapologetic album than her 2012 album, “Unapologetic.”But “Anti” offers a glimpse not only into Rihanna’s professional life, but also her personal life. Several songs allude to past lovers, from Travis Scott in “Woo” (“Bet she could never made you cry / ‘Cause the scars on your heart are still mine”) to Chris Brown in “Love on the Brain” (“Must be love on the brain / That’s got me feeling this way / It beats me black and blue but it fucks me so good”). Rihanna does not shy away from talking about her love life, down to the last song of the album, piano ballad “Close to You,” which is evocative of her similarly lovelorn 2012 hit “Stay.” With a minute left in the song and album, Rihanna ends singing with a final goodbye (“If you let me, I'd be there by now / Close to you”) to allow the music to speak for itself.However, while the album succeeds overall in its attempt at revealing a more mature Rihanna, several songs, specifically those added in the Deluxe version, undermine this very idea. “Pose” is initially an erratic mix of incongruous sounds that eventually meld into a less grating but more expected song, emphasized especially by the repetitive, nonsensical lyrics: “Bitch I know you know / Bitch I know you know / Bitch I know / Like wow / All my haters so so broke / Pipe down.” The track  is followed by the equally derivative “Sex With Me,” a mediocre rehash of “S&M” (“Sex with me so amazing / Vodka and water and a lemon / And a few other things I cannot mention”). With these so-called bonus tracks, she blemishes an otherwise dynamic and transformative album with disappointing additions that sound more like failed experiments in sound mixing than her typical polished pop.These bonus tracks notwithstanding, “Anti-” is a satisfying balm to the painful anticipation fans felt awaiting the album’s release. Rihanna’s eighth album is the product of years of hard work (the previous four of which were relatively silent for her), and it pays off. Known for being a prolific singer—she released about an album a year from 2005 to 2012—Rihanna has taken a step back to reevaluate her career, and her patience has been rewarded. “Anti” successfully demonstrates that Rihanna is not only an entertainer, but an artist.—Staff writer Mila Gauvin II can be reached at mila.gauvin@thecrimson.com.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A huge white feminist pastime is to criticize Beyoncé, questioning her feminism. The argument is that Beyoncé talks too much about her husband, dances too sexually, too often references her sex life. Once, fed up after months of garbage think-pieces and fiery debate in the media (read: on white Twitter) on the validity of her feminism, Beyoncé stood on stage under the word “FEMINIST” in giant pink letters, followed by the literal dictionary definition of the word feminist. If that wasn’t clear enough, she sampled Chimamanda Ngozi Adichi’s voice reading said dictionary definition. What people asked from Beyoncé when they demanded clearer feminism was that she comply with the hegemonic, white-controlled and -decided “feminism,” and what she gave them was loud, and black, and hers. It is not “feminist” as in girl power, it’s “slay” as in screw you.
“Formation” is a black anthem, the video a masterpiece of art as activism. Trampling through subjects many artists fear to even broach, the message in “Formation” is unmistakable, unignorable. Here, there is no room for debate. In this black activism, Beyoncé has left no part of herself behind.
The video is woman centric-throughout, and certainly also family-centric. Early in the video, we get to see Jay-Z and Beyoncé’s beautiful daughter, Blue Ivy, giggling among other children. Beyoncé is shown sitting for a sort of Southern Gothic family portrait with several other women. The feminists, or at least the ones with the think-pieces, I’m sure, breathe a sigh of relief. There will be no scary Jay-Z ruining this video. Beyoncé has put her sex away for now, for activism.
Three minutes into the video, on a plantation style wrap around porch, surrounded by a reclaimed black gentry, Beyoncé takes the foreground, her eyes obscured by a wide brimmed black hat but undoubtedly betraying a smirk, and croons, “When he f*** me good I take his ass to Red Lobster. If he hit it right, I might take him on a flight on my chopper.” She raises two manicured, heavily jeweled middle fingers to the notion that she can’t be a radical black feminist and also rejoice in her own sexual pleasure.
The video’s sex-positivity is a small fraction of the momentous, intersectional work done in the “Formation” video. The video opens with the voice of the late Messy Mya, New Orleans comedian, asking, “What happened at the New Wil’ins?” With this, “Formation” is immediately drawing lines—someone is doing the asking, and someone is being asked. The video starts here, with the government negligence that devastated New Orleans, and sweeps history, centering queer and gender non-conforming voices, queering the American South, Beyoncé holding cops—the only white people in the video—in the palm of her hands. Beyoncé and her child and her people take over the indulgent homes that are landmarks of the South’s fundamental hostility toward them. She shakes it. She twirls. With her own body, she drowns a cop car.
She calls her “ladies”—all black women—to get in formation with her. And this is what black feminism is. When Beyoncé says “slay,” she means that all the black folks in the video look fly as hell, obviously. But she also means that she is putting her body and her art into the spaces that have intentionally betrayed her—the southern plantation, the hung portraits, the floodwaters of the Ninth Ward. She stands atop a New Orleans cop car, her fist in the air, and then she sinks below the surface of the water with it. What the white queer folks who relentlessly appropriate black culture don’t understand about the word “slay” is that sometimes, this is what slaying looks like. Beyoncé is unbelievably wealthy and privileged, but she understands that for her people this is a slay-or-be-slain world. Literally.
A lot of the time, Beyoncé is for everybody. Her music about feminism, love, and partying is for all women, and really for anyone. Her music about heartbreak is for the heartbroken. But what Beyoncé has done with “Formation” is momentous because in its rejoicing it is, unmistakably, by and for black people—especially for black femmes.
Beyoncé, whose holy name is so often invoked by the wrong mouths, who has been mishandled and misappropriated and misunderstood, makes this one thing clear. Black artists like Beyoncé know well enough that just because a work is for black people does not mean only black people will hold it in their arms. And so, just before the video ends, we see the words “stop shooting us” scrawled in graffiti. And once again, there is a line drawn: someone doing the telling, and someone being told.

The Harvard Model Congress staff is lying on the beach in Dubai (no, not the air conditioned one). I say, “I could go for some Starbucks oatmeal right now.” To which one of my peers says, “You know what I’m looking forward to? HUDS oatmeal.”
The classic review of Harvard University Dining Services is conducted. Consensus: Steel-cut oatmeal is great; rolled-oats are variable; chili is the bomb.
Later, we are milling around waiting to go on a safari and, yet again, HUDS hijacks the conversation. Someone would like to present his eight-point plan on how to improve Harvard dining. There are groans, but he proceeds anyway. His plan calls for three dining halls with different offerings, rather than twelve nearly identical ones, and for getting rid of dining restrictions, or at the very least, “community nights.”
The former suggestion is unlikely; the latter is not only possible, but should be done. The restrictions, among them “community night,” divide rather than unite.
The problems are numerous. Quadlings and Matherites are arguably disadvantaged by the policy. Mealtime interactions between first-years and upperclassmen are already hampered by the myriad restrictions that are in place every other day of the week (looking at you, Adams and Quincy) and “community night” only makes it worse. Additionally, anecdotal evidence suggests that the Quad Houses, which do not have dining hall restrictions, and largely ignore “community night,” feature the strongest communities. Perhaps most importantly, within each House, students tend to sit with their blockmates and not with the larger community the policy is meant to cultivate.
Community can be built in many ways, but it won’t be built without dialogue.
Students understand the problems well; it comes up in conversation often. The fact that if community night was abolished, students could spend more time talking about art or social theory, instead of why the policy is ineffective or where they will convene Thursday nights, should be reason enough for administrators to reconsider the policy.
But even I’ll admit that reason is a bit facetious and the Quad’s supposed superior community is purely anecdotal. The College should be engaging students in dialogue, asking them for feedback on new programs. It should look to our responses to see if the new programs are indeed effective in creating the kind of community it has been criticized for lacking.
Here’s the thing: The questions aren’t being asked. Rather, the administration seems to be throwing solutions against the proverbial wall in the hopes of creating community and then forgetting to check which ones stick.
In the recent survey on House life, the College chose to ask grand questions on a one to five scale: “To what extent, if at all, has being a member of your House community provided you with the opportunity to think deeply about your own values? Assumptions you may have about others?”
It also asked some slightly more concrete questions: Rate your level of agreement with statements like “In my House, my social network includes students outside of my blocking group” and “In my House, my social network includes students from different class years than me.”
The College hopes we agree with these statements. And maybe we do. But anyone who’s taken Stat 104 can tell you that, even if we do agree, the results might have nothing to do with Thursday dinners. I met one of my upperclassmen friends in Pfoho because her linkmate, a friend of mine, invited us all to eat in Cabot (not on a Thursday, of course); I met another waiting for the shuttle.
I was hesitant to agree with these statements because they had been achieved through serendipity rather than by efforts of the House. I would have been far more amenable to answering some simple, but far more useful questions.
“How many times have you attended ‘community night’ this semester?” And then, “Would you say it enhanced house life? What changes, if any, would you make to the program?” Or perhaps, “Have you been to a social event in the Cabot Aquarium or one of the new Dunster common rooms?” and “Would you like to see fast track party registration implemented in all Houses?”
Those of us who mulled over these issues in Dubai would have suggested only a few “community nights” a semester, so that they are truly special. We would like to see efforts towards creating spaces and organizing activities that encourage spontaneous meetings and low-stakes encounters between peers within our own (arbitrarily assigned) Houses, but also the College community at large.
We are only a sample size of ten. Why not find out what the rest of the student body thinks? With constructive and directed feedback, the College could modify its approach appropriately.
It took five years, but a review of the Program in General Education exposed that it was not fulfilling its goals. It shouldn’t take nearly as long to determine that “community night” is not meeting its mission.
There may be no dumb questions; some are just more productive than others.

Harvard’s relationship with Allston has long been tumultuous. From its anonymous purchases of land across the Charles River nearly 20 years ago to its abrupt decision to halt construction during the financial crisis, the University has often failed to engender trust with the neighborhood and its residents.
In recent years, however, the relationship has improved. In conjunction with the University’s own projects in Allston, Harvard has embarked upon various initiatives beneficial to the neighborhood. Unfortunately, too much of the Harvard-Allston relationship is still characterized by a lack of communication. In particular, criticism of the accessibility of Harvard-Allston Task Force meetings—the forum at which residents can express reservations and learn about Harvard’s projects—has recently escalated.
Harvard should not shoulder all the blame: The Boston Redevelopment Authority, the agency under whose auspices the task force operates, also has a role to play in alleviating residents’ concerns. Harvard, nevertheless, should do what it can to ensure that all Allstonians have access to the meetings and can help shape the neighborhood’s future.
One way in which Harvard should increase accessibility to the task force meetings is by ensuring that they actually take place in residential sections of Allston. Over the past two years, most meetings have occurred at the Fiorentino Community Center in Brighton and Harvard Business School, neither of which are convenient for those living in Allston’s residential areas.
A better alternative exists: Residents would likely prefer the Honan-Allston library, currently the site of some meetings. Though the library's early closing has imposed artificial limits on the length and scope of meetings, Harvard could step in and pay the cost of keeping the library open. This would be both a gesture of good faith and allow more residents to take part in these critical discussions.
Another means through which Harvard and the BRA could support community access to task force meetings would be by providing interpreters for non-English speaking Allston residents. From 2006 to 2007, the BRA provided interpreters at meetings, but cited under-utilization in ending the initiative.
Beyond questions of location and language, tailoring outreach efforts to reach more residents and ensuring that meeting times accommodate working-class residents would help ensure that the task force’s sessions include a representative cross-section of the neighborhood.
In addition, residents too often report feeling that Harvard’s responses to their concerns are perfunctory, especially since more time at meetings is devoted to presentations about Harvard’s plans than to community feedback. Not all complaints merit endless discussion, but the University must remain attentive to feedback and work to dispel notions that task force meetings are a public relations exercise.
Ultimately, none of these criticisms should mask the serious efforts that Harvard has made to improve its relationship with Allston over the past several years. The current construction represents an exciting moment for the University, the neighborhood, and the city, and all sides have a role in shaping this opportunity. Through increasing the accessibility of its Allston Task Force meetings, Harvard can play its part.

Students at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences will be able to purchase semester MBTA bus and link passes at 50 percent off beginning next fall, a more generous discount than the current 11 percent.
The link pass, which can be used for unlimited bus and T rides, currently costs $267 per semester at the existing 11 percent discount offered by the MBTA to participating universities. The new discount, funded by the GSAS administration, will lower that fare to $150, half off the original price.
After the new discount, students who purchase passes for both the fall and spring semesters will save a total of $156 on the bus pass and $234 on the link pass.
GSAS dean for administration and finance Allen Aloise, who took on the job in July, spearheaded the change. Aloise said he visited students across the school’s various programs in order solicit their feedback.
“One of the things that I heard from students was that many of them rely on mass transportation to get to campus,” Aloise said. “And they felt that the 11 percent discount they were getting on the MBTA passes was too low, and I agreed.”
According to Aloise, about 400 of the roughly 4,000 GSAS students live in one of the four graduate student residential halls, and about 500 live in Harvard University housing in the Cambridge area. The rest live in the greater Boston area, and many utilize public transportation to commute to campus.
Aloise added that while the school’s administration does not collect data on how far away students are currently living in comparison to previous years, anecdotal evidence suggests students are living farther away from campus.
Such is the case for Joseph M. Reilly, a Ph.D student who lives in Brookline, a few miles south of Cambridge.
“People are just getting priced out of Cambridge. More biotechs and startups keep opening up. Lots of people are trying to move into that area between MIT and Harvard,” Reilly said. “It’s just really expensive, especially if you have kids.”
Reilly, who bought a local bus pass for this semester, said the new discount was a pleasant surprise.
“I was excited,” he said. “It kind of came out of the blue, but that’s a nice perk.”
Jieun Choi, a graduate student in Astronomy, lives in Porter Square and travels to her office at the Center for Astrophysics by foot. But she still intends to buy a discounted pass next fall.
“Mostly I take the bus to go to my climbing gym a couple times a week,” Choi said. “It’s not worth it for me right now when it’s just 11 percent, but with 50 percent it will definitely be worth it.”
Aloise said he and his colleagues, including GSAS Dean Xiao-Li Meng, responded to graduate student concerns by reallocating funds in order to increase the discount.
“I think it’s a nice illustration of how important it is for graduate students to make their needs known to GSAS,” Aloise said. “We are ready and willing to listen to them, we have a history of listening to them, and we’re strong advocates for them.”

Once the Faculty approve a new program in General Education, all students will likely choose Gen Ed courses from the same, revamped offerings, according to Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith.
“I don’t want to run two programs at the same time,” Smith said, emphasizing the need he sees “to transition to the new program as effectively and efficiently as possible.”
“We know there are issues in the current program, and we want our students in the new program,” he added.
If approved, the new system—which Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris presented at a faculty meeting earlier this month—would require students to complete classes in four new Gen Ed categories, fulfill a distribution requirement, and take one numerical reasoning-based course.
Discussions about the transition for students completing the current Gen Ed requirements anchored last week’s Committee on Undergraduate Education meeting, where administrators said students still would receive credit for completed requirements in the current eight Gen Ed categories.
Administrators and professors, however, have not finalized the details for the transition process.
The faculty council, which is the highest elected FAS body, will vote on the proposed Gen Ed legislation  during their bi-weekly meeting on Wednesday, according to the meeting agenda.
Aside from customary remarks by Smith and a report presented by a faculty Docket Committee, the Gen Ed vote is the only item on the agenda. Typically the Faculty Council agenda has three or four items for discussion.
Psychology professor Jason P. Mitchell, who sits on the faculty council, said Wednesday’s meeting will allow for greater discussion of potential issues in the legislation.
“I think there will be a number of comments on the details of the legislation, and there may be some discussion about making sure that we are fixing the problems of the existing Gen Ed program by re-legislating,” Mitchell said, adding that he hopes the council will ensure that the “new revitalized program actually does address the deficiencies in the current program.”
As administrators move forward with the new program, a standing committee on General Education, chaired by Philosophy Department Chair Edward J. Hall, will have more responsibilities for streamlining Gen Ed courses, Smith said.
Hall said the Faculty have three main steps moving forward: deciding when the new program will debut and replace the old one, setting up a flexible transition, and reviewing the existing Gen Ed selections and vetting proposals for new courses.
Exactly how to execute the last two topics will become clearer after the Faculty vote on the new program, likely later this semester, Hall said.

UPDATED: February 10, 2016,  at 11:45 a.m.
As the Harvard Divinity School’s capital campaign exceeds the halfway mark, its hallowed Andover Hall will undergo a renewal into a central hub for multifaith religion, academic study, and events addressing social issues. 
Built in 1911, Andover Hall is Harvard’s only example of the “Collegiate Gothic” architectural style. Originally constructed by the Andover Theological Seminary and later joining the Divinity School’s campus with Harvard’s purchase of the facility in 1935, Andover Hall is considered to be the “centerpiece of the campus”, according to Divinity School Director of Operations Ralph DeFlorio.
Several factors drive the Andover Hall project, including a desire from Divinity School Dean David N. Hempton to place the school at the center of the ongoing University vision of “One Harvard,” HDS Associate Director of Development Communications Paul B. Massari ’90 said.
“The work we do looks at religion’s influence on every area of study, whether it’s peace and security, global health, gender studies,” Massari said. “So we need this place to be open and welcome to the entire Harvard community.”
Funding for the proposed renovations will flow in large part from the Divinity School’s participation in the University’s ongoing capital campaign. Specifically, HDS has raised $26 million to date since its public launch two years ago, composed of over 5,200 gifts and pledges, according to HDS Associate Director for Campaign and Donor Relations Lauren E. Wilson. The Divinity school’s campaign passed the halfway point for the overall $50 million goal last October.
While the school’s general capital campaign continues to garner support from donors, the renovations to Andover Hall will likely require $50 million alone, according to Massari. Following a trend in recent years of the University granting namesakes for large donations, he said that a donor could have the chance to name the building with a “lead gift” of $35 million or more.
“Our campaign goal is still the same. We’re not raising that, but to have the kind of transformation that we’re really aiming for with Andover, we’d have to exceed our campaign goal,” Massari said.
The vision for Andover Hall includes the creation of a “true campus center” that can unify the School’s social spaces, student services, and academic resources such as the Andover Library, according to the 2014 Dean’s Report.
In addition to reallocation and renovation of spaces, changes to Andover Hall will include modifications for wheelchair accessibility. Sustainability will also be a focus, as the designs are geared, in part, at garnering a "gold" certification award from the "Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design," DeFlorio said.
“LEED Gold is really to address the moral imperative of climate change. The School has, throughout its history, produced graduates who were outspoken leaders on the moral issues of their day,” Massari said. “The big ethical issue of today is climate change, so really, all of our buildings have to address that.”
Designers also hope to redesign Andover Chapel into a space more suited  for multifaith services. At the time of the building’s initial construction a century ago, the chapel was designed with a “Christian-flavored” seminary environment in mind, DeFlorio said.
“Now we’re a pluralistic school. We want to be inclusive to every tradition,” he said. “One of the design challenges that we have is, ‘how can we create a worship space that is something that everybody can feel comfortable in?’”
DeFlorio said there is a “tricky” balance between maintaining the historical legacy of Andover Hall when renovating the space. He added that research groups have been consulted in the early stages of the design process and Divinity School students, faculty, staff, and alumni will be included in the deliberations for how to best approach the creation of a truly multifaith chapel.
Concrete plans for the renewal project are projected to begin in roughly a year or a year and a half, once campaign donations reach a certain threshold for the project, according to DeFlorio.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction
CORRECTION: Feb. 10, 2016
An earlier version of this article misquoted Paul B. Massari ’90. In fact, he said that LEED Gold is intended to address "the moral imperative of climate change," not introduce it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Debates over race and historical legacies have traveled about two miles downstream to MIT, where several House masters voted to request changing the title, which some associate with slavery.
In January, the MIT House masters present at a meeting unanimously voted to consider changing their title of “Housemaster,” which, similar to the Harvard position, names faculty who lead residence halls of 100 to 500 students. House masters, administrators, and students are currently debating the change, according to John M. Essigmann, one of MIT’s more than 25 Housemasters. 
Essigmann wrote in an email that administrators narrowed potential replacements from about 20 choices down to two terms: House Dean and Head of House. MIT Chancellor Cynthia Barnhart must approve the proposal before administrators can change the title, according to Essigmann.
Proponents of the name change framed the debate in largely similar terms as Harvard’s House masters, who decided unanimously in November to change their title. Dean of the College and Cabot House master Rakesh Khurana said in November that he would inform the College of a new title early this year, but administrators have yet to settle on revised nomenclature.
In emails between MIT students and faculty, Essigmann wrote that the decision to replace the title arose “primarily because of the negative historical connotations associated with the term.”
“I do note that a significant number of students prefer the existing Housemaster title,” he wrote. “I believe, however, that the historical negatives of the word ‘master’ and the fact that it is not gender neutral, may not have been considered by those students.”
Many MIT House masters and a member of the Dormitory Council—a student body representing MIT students living on campus—declined to comment, saying administrators have not yet decided on a new title.
Two miles west of MIT, Harvard administrators have also yet to provide a selection of alternative titles, although some have speculated potential picks.
According to Essigmann, MIT administrators settled on the two terms because of their gender neutrality and avoidance of “words that might cause confusion or offense.” He added that Head of House in particular is favorite among many students, because of its appeal to Harry Potter fans.
For Peter F. Lake ’81, a professor at Stetson University College of Law who specializes in higher education law, debates at MIT and Harvard reflect a broader shift among national universities that are revisiting their past and putting legacies on trial.
“It’s kind of a new way about looking into the past and reviewing it through the modern lens and thinking about what deserves to come forward and what needs to be revived,” Lake said.
Lake said the intensity of debates over historical legacies have become more charged in recent years. At Harvard, University President Drew G. Faust advocated against renaming buildings en masse, though she has addressed recent student protests over support for minority students on campus.
Lake predicted that other universities may follow in Harvard and MIT’s footsteps by bringing their controversial histories into public debate.
“There’s no question that when a school shifts, supporters of a different model get a shot in the arm and say ‘hey they changed things at Harvard, why not here?’” Lake added. “There’s no reason things have to be static or unreviewable.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 10, 2016, at 7:58 p.m.
After kicking off the semester with a week of educational workshops, a new batch of student counselors are now ready to advise their peers in approaching health, social, and personal concerns.
Following weeks of pubbing emails, postering flyers, and conducting interviews, recruitment for campus peer-counseling organizations, including groups like Contact Peer Counseling and Eating Concerns Hotline and Outreach, culminates in thirty to forty hours of training.
With the recently opened QuadTalk counseling service, which offers nightly peer counseling for upperclassmen in the Quad from various counseling organizations on a rotating schedule, demand for Contact counselors has expanded, according to Marisa E. Houlahan ’17, co-director Contact.
“Our staff has grown bigger than it has been in the past just to accommodate extra hours,” Houlahan said.
ECHO co-director Karen M. Maldonado ’18 said that although the number of recruits for ECHO fluctuates from year to year, recent years have seen an increase in staff, growing from 13 members last fall to 18 members this spring.
“We increased numbers recently just to better serve the community,” Maldonado said. “Having a big staff makes it nice to sort of allocate evenly the burden on each of our staffers.”
Although each organization conducts its own specifically tailored workshops, some groups share similar programming. For example, ECHO’s workshops hone in on issues of body image, body concerns, exercise and eating concerns, while also covering counseling techniques used for general issues, according to Maldonado.
“We have a lot of training on [the] basics of peer counseling. We are trained to handle any issue,” Maldonado said. “Anyone can call ECHO with any sort of concern, nothing is too small.”
Held for new and returning counselors alike, ECHO’s workshops include meetings with Cambridge-area doctors and experts who provide information about the psychology of concerns counselors might confront and available resources near Harvard.
Workshops for Contact Peer Counseling include role playing and practice drop-ins, among other activities, according to Houlahan.
Last spring, Room 13, a peer counseling group based out of Thayer basement, received around 70 applications, with no upper limits on the number accepted, according to Room 13 co-director Andrew D. Kim ’16. When publicizing the organization, members of Room 13 pay special attention to attract a diverse array of applicants, according to Kim.
“We think really hard about trying to make sure our pub is reaching different communities on campus so that our staff can be as representative as possible,” Kim said.
Houlahan also said she values diversity, a characteristic she associates with higher quality counseling.
“We get all different types of people, and we make a conscious effort as we put together our staff to have a sort of a diverse range of perspectives,” Houlahan said. “One of the things we really value about our staff is we have a lot of different experiences, which I think helps us be better counselors.”
Kim described his experience as a peer counselor as rewarding and encouraged other students to join peer counseling groups.
“It’s the only extracurricular I do now because it feels real to me in a way that often times a lot of other work at Harvard doesn’t,” Kim said, “It’s a way of getting engaged with mental health that’s very personal and direct.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Under red, white, and blue streamers and semi-circular Americana buntings, Harvard students and faculty members gathered at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum to watch Donald J. Trump and Bernard “Bernie” Sanders win handily in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday.
Both elections were called at 8:00 p.m., as soon as all of the polls had officially closed. The only tension that remained at the Institute of Politics was over the second and third place finishers in the Republican race and the final margins of victory in both the Democratic and Republican races.
Richard L. Berke, moderator of the IOP watch party and writer for the Boston Globe's Stat News, was surprised at how quickly the elections were called, saying it is “really unusual for the election to be called this early.”
“I’m used to tough, long primary nights and this was seamless and easy,” he said. “It’s almost anticlimactic.”
During the event, several political experts—including David M. Axelrod, chief strategist for Barack H. Obama’s presidential campaigns, James Pindell, political reporter for the Boston Globe, and Ana Navarro, former IOP fellow and CNN political analyst—called into the IOP to offer commentary. The IOP also hosted their own version of the primary, where attendees could drop a candy into a candidate’s jar to “vote.”
Members of Harvard Students for Bernie, including its president, He Li ’16, were excited about the election results.
 “I think the reason that this victory is very meaningful is that in 2008 this is the state Hillary beat the polls and beat Obama,” he said. “It’s meaningful that Bernie could win despite that history, and it speaks to the strength of his ground game in the early states and the energy and enthusiasm that his supporters are feeling for him.”
A contingent of the Harvard College Democrats also expressed excitement over the results of the Democratic primary. Member Reed T. Shafer-Ray ’18 said he was “happy to see Sanders doing so well.”
The Harvard Republican Club, for the most part, was unsurprised by Trump’s victory, but some were paying close attention to the eventual runners-up.
Aaron I. Henricks ’16, the former president of the Harvard Republican Club, said he was “just looking forward to people dropping out” so that the party could “consolidate anti-Trump support.”
Gavin S. Sullivan ’17, another member of the Harvard Republican Club, said he was more concerned with John E. “Jeb” Bush’s strong showing than with Trump’s victory.
“I’m excited to see Jeb do so well in New Hampshire, and I hope to see Kasich supporters move to his team as the election moves on,” he said.

Ninety-one percent of contributions to current presidential candidates made by Harvard faculty, instructors, and researchers in 2015 went to former Secretary of State Hillary R. Clinton, according to a Crimson analysis of Federal Election Commission filings.
Between April and December of 2015, a total of 81 Harvard faculty, instructors, and researchers donated roughly $131,000 to the presidential campaigns of Clinton, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, former Florida governor Jeb Bush, Florida senator Marco Rubio, and New Jersey governor Chris Christie.
Of the individuals who donated, 37 gave the maximum contribution for the primary period—$2,700—to Clinton.
Of total donations, just $8,850 went to Republican candidates Bush, Rubio, and Christie. The remaining $3,290 in donations went to Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders. All other candidates—including GOP frontrunners Donald J. Trump and Ted Cruz, who came first in the Iowa caucuses last week—received no contributions from Harvard faculty, instructors, and researchers listed in the FEC filings.
For this story, The Crimson analyzed the federal donations of contributors who reported Harvard University as their employer and were listed in Harvard directories and websites as professors, lecturers, fellows, associates, researchers, and scientists, as well as visiting fellows and professors. The data set does not include students or administrators who are not listed as teachers or researchers.
Donations from faculty members with appointments at multiple schools at Harvard only counted toward the total of the school at which they hold  primary appointments.
For candidate committees, contributions are limited to $2,700 a person for each of the primary and general elections. A small portion of the funds included in this analysis— less than $500—are already reserved for the general election, since contributors may elect to give over $2,700 during the primary phase of an election that may only be spent if their chosen candidate receives the nomination.
The contributions data are made public in quarterly filings to the Federal Election Commission. The figures do not include contributions made to super PACs and nonprofits groups organized under section 501(c)(4) of the tax code that engage in electioneering communications, and excludes contributions made to candidates who have since dropped out of the race.
BREAKDOWN
Instructors and researchers at the Business School contributed the most money to presidential candidates in 2015, donating $36,600 overall, while those with the Faculty of Arts and Sciences contributed a total of roughly $26,000, the next largest contribution total per Harvard school.
All donations from FAS researchers and instructors went to Sanders and Clinton, as did all contributions from their peers at the Kennedy School of Government, Harvard Medical School, the Graduate School of Education, the School of Public Health, the Graduate School of Design. Former University President Lawrence H. Summers and former Kennedy School Dean Graham T. Allison both contributed the primary election limit of $2,700 to Clinton.
Two Business School instructors contributed $5,400 to GOP candidates—the highest amount of support of all of Harvard’s schools. The only other Republican donor was Law School lecturer Norm Champ, who contributed to the Christie and Rubio campaigns. 
Government professor Theda R. Skocpol, who donated $650 to Clinton’s campaign, said she was not surprised by faculty donations thus far.
“We know that business leaders and very wealthy private fortunes tilt towards the conservative and Republican side, and we know that professors tilt towards the liberal and Democratic side—that’s been true for a long time,” Skocpol said.
The results mirror a similar data analysis conducted by the Crimson last spring, which found that 84 percent of contributions made by a comparable group of Harvard affiliates between 2011 and the third quarter of 2014 went to federal Democratic campaigns and political action committees. Several major donors listed during that time period, including Law School dean Martha Minow and Dunster House Master Roger B. Porter, did not make a campaign contribution last year for the 2016 presidential race.
With many of her Harvard contributors giving the $2,700 cap, Clinton received an average donation from those individuals of about $1,263. Sanders, by contrast, received an average contribution of roughly $89.
Skocpol noted, however, that since the contributions analyzed end last December, the data may not capture the surge of support Sanders has seen over the past month. Sanders won the New Hampshire Democratic primary by a wide margin late Tuesday evening.
“That was a period when it wasn’t 100 percent clear there was going to be a huge amount of competition in the Democratic primary,” Skocpol said.
POLITICS AT HARVARD
When Barack Obama ran for his first term in 2007, he turned to Harvard academics—among them applied economics professor David M. Cutler ’87, and public policy professor Jeffrey B. Liebman—for policy advice. And former professors of his at the Law School—such as Laurence H. Tribe—hosted fundraisers for him.
Texas senator Ted Cruz, who attended Harvard Law, has received no contributions from Harvard faculty thus far according to the FEC filings.
While there is no  immediate Harvard connection in the Democratic field, Skocpol predicted that Harvard experts would provide policy advice for the Democratic candidates, especially Clinton.
Graduate School of Education professor Howard E. Gardner ’65 said professors—especially those directly involved in presidential campaigns—should separate their political views from their teaching in the classroom.
“I think basically one needs to monitor oneself and one needs to be as politically disinterested and neutral when you’re dealing with your role as a teacher,” Gardner said.
“When faculty take off a whole term to work for a candidate, they really have to cut their ties with students [during that time],” he added.
Skocpol agreed that professors should separate their roles as citizens and instructors, and set aside what they “wish would happen” when conducting research for “what is actually happening out there.” She noted, however, that reported contributions from faculty are relatively insignificant and not those of the greatest importance or concern.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BOSTON — It was the second time in as many weeks that the Harvard women’s hockey team travelled across the river to face off against a crosstown rival in the Beanpot Tuesday night.
The Crimson (14-9-2, 10-6-2 ECAC) met up with Boston University (17-11-2, 14-4-2 Hockey East) across the river for the tournament’s consolation game. Harvard found itself in the loser’s bracket of the tournament after falling 8-0 in the opening round to Boston College, the team that would eventually go on to win the tournament.
Despite the beating in the first round, the Crimson returned to Walter Brown Arena with its offense at full steam, putting five goals past the host team en route to a 5-3 victory Tuesday night.
The upperclassmen shone brightly on the ice for Harvard, with all five goals coming from juniors and seniors. Senior captain Miye D’Oench and junior forward Sydney Daniels each had two goals on the night while junior defender Briana Mastel tallied one of her own.
D’Oench and Daniels are currently tied for the top goal scorers on the team, each with 11 on the season.
“What I think about our team that makes us so great is that it could be anyone out there scoring goals,” Daniels said. “If you look at the game sheets there is so much diversity and I’m just lucky that I’m getting them but honestly it could be anyone.”
The beginning of the game looked eerily similar to the Crimson’s first round Beanpot showing, during  which BC scored five goals in the opening period, including two in the opening six minutes of the game. The Terriers’ offense was almost able to mirror Harvard’s previous opponent, finding the back of the net twice in a matter of five minutes and adding a third before the end of the period.
The first goal came only a minute and 14 seconds into the game when junior forward Maddie Elia beat out senior keeper Emerance Maschmeyer and found the back of the net.
Elia came back less than four minutes later to add to BU’s lead, having help from Rebecca Leslie and Rebecca Russo.
“The game had a very different feel in it from the start even if we were down 3-1 early,” Harvard head coach Katey Stone said. “We felt like we were in it the entire time and from my perspective we played Harvard hockey and kept coming at them the entire time.”
It was not until the third period that the Crimson’s offense came to life. After coming up short with only one goal in the first 54 minutes of hockey, Harvard came up with three in the final seven minutes of play.
The offensive push was spearheaded by Daniels, who had two of the team’s three third period goals. From close range Daniels was able to poke the puck past Terrier goalie Victoria Hanson inside of the seven-minute mark, tying the game at three.
Daniels’ stick came through for the go ahead and ultimate game-winning goal under five minutes later when she fielded a pass sophomore Karly Heffernan and shot the puck past Hanson for the go-ahead tally.
“I think our kids were hungry and they just kept coming at them,” Stone said. “We were able to stave off their pressure and work our way up the ice and I feel like they [BU] fought it in their defensive end and we fought back. Our forecheck was great.”
One aspect of the Crimson’s game that did not shine throughout the night was its power play on both sides of the puck. Throughout the contest Harvard was called for four penalties, resulting in eight minutes of power play for the Terriers. In one of those man-advantage situations BU was able to capitalize on the opportunity and net a goal.
The Crimson was also unable to capitalize on its opponent’s mistakes. Having four power play opportunities itself during the course of the night, Harvard squandered all of them.
Despite the lack of productivity during power plays, the attitude of the team now on a two-game win streak is that of hopefulness, having found a new chemistry between the lines.
“I honestly think we are trying to keep it very light and stick to the things we know,” Daniels said. “It comes down to having fun and playing hockey at the end of the day.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If someone were to ask for a one-word description for the 2014-2015 Harvard women’s hockey team, there would likely be a common adjective: surprising.
While Crimson coach Katey Stone and her team–one filled with talented and experienced players–would likely insist that they knew last season’s exploits were feats Harvard had the potential to achieve from the start, it seemed hard to believe during certain points of the season.
After taking a 10-2 pounding against then-No. 2/2 Boston College at Chestnut Hill, few would have picked the Crimson to come out victorious in a rematch between the two teams for the 2015 Beanpot. But that’s exactly what Harvard did.
Playing in the confines of the Bright-Landry Hockey Center, the Harvard players crowned themselves Queens of Boston, pulling off an unexpected 3-2 victory.
The win sparked a stretch of games that saw the Crimson claim the ECAC Playoff crown and make a run through the NCAA tournament–which included another one-goal triumph over the Eagles–before falling short of the national title in a 4-1 virtual road loss to top-ranked Minnesota.
Going into this season, any Crimson success was not going to startle fans. Despite losing a senior class that included Olympians Lyndsey Fry and Josephine Pucci—as well as co-captain Sami Reber, among others—Harvard had key players such as senior Miye D’Oench, junior Sydney Daniels, and co-captains Michelle Picard and Emerance Maschmeyer coming back along with a solid cast of young talent. The media certainly seemed to think highly of the Crimson, as the team started the season ranked No. 5/4.
With just four games left before the start of playoff season, there has to be a degree of disappointment with the way Harvard’s season has turned out. The Crimson are unranked and sit fifth in the ECAC, outside of the top-four requirement needed to get home ice for the ECAC playoffs.
After losing a tight 2-0 game to top-ranked BC at home, I couldn’t help but think that last week’s game–a rematch against BC in the semifinals of the 2016 Beanpot–could be the spark that would turn the season around. Maybe another upset win over an undefeated top-ranked Eagles squad would start another magical run.
BC 5, Harvard 0. That was the score after the first frame of an 8-0 loss. As my co-writer and I came back from Walter Brown Arena, it seemed to us that barring an ECAC Playoff title—which would likely include beating a Quinnipiac squad the Crimson lost to twice—Harvard’s chances of returning to the NCAA Tournament were slim.
Despite a solid weekend which saw the Crimson pick up a win and a tie against Yale and Brown, respectively, the opening period of the Beanpot Consolation game against Boston University on Tuesday seemed like a continuation of the BC game.
Less than five minutes in, BU had put two past Maschmeyer. While D’Oench responded less than half a minute later, Harvard ultimately went to the locker room down 3-1 after 20 minutes. It seemed like the Crimson would be tacking on another loss.
And then, something surprising happened.
Harvard, helped by some luck when Maschmeyer barely managed to cover a shot and prevent a BU goal, came roaring back. The first line, led by Daniels, came to life and sent three goals into the net in the last 6:12 of the game after junior Brianna Mastel had pulled one back in the second frame.
Harvard 5, BU 3. Despite the bleak start, the Crimson managed to turn it around.
While many might not consider a Beanpot Consolation match to be of much importance, this is exactly the spark Harvard needs. With its back against the wall, the Crimson found a way to fight back, something the Harvard has struggled to do all season.
The Crimson sits only one point behind fourth-place Colgate in the ECAC standings and despite playing its last four ECAC games on the road it has a fighting chance at netting a fourth place finish. Harvard’s last four games come against Colgate and three teams located at the bottom half of conference standings.
There’s plenty of hockey left to play for Harvard, and if the team manages to control home ice and host the ECAC quarterfinals at Bright-Landry, the door is wide open for the Crimson.
While Harvard will likely be playing on the road from the ECAC semifinals onward were it to make it that far, all it takes is a spark at the right time. If Tuesday’s game is any indication of where where the Crimson finds itself at this point in the season, not only will this team refuse to go down without a fight, but another pleasant surprise might be waiting Stone’s team.

Act now or risk being alone forever. That's right, Datamatch 2016, as launched by the Harvard Computer Society with collaboration from Satire V and Professor of Psychology Steven Pinker, will be closing 12:00 a.m. on Valentine's Day. That's tonight for all of you who have trouble keeping track of what day it is. Don't miss this opportunity to find true, algorithm-based love at Harvard and the chance to eat free waffles at Zinneken’s, paid for by HCS. Help Harvard contribute to income inequality and continue to be the elite breeding ground that it is.
As reported in the New York Times in early 2015, Psychologist Arthur Aron did research on closeness and created a quiz consisting of 36 questions intended to be answered with a complete stranger. You’re supposed to fall in love with said stranger by the end of the quiz. The thinking behind this is that the vulnerability created by these questions draws people together. It seems as if Datamatch follows a similar format, promising the perfect match through intimate questions such as this:
What's your favorite pickup line?
- Did it hurt? When you tripped on the sidewalk because of Cambridge's notoriously dangerous ancient cobblestone walkways?
- I'd like to add you to my professional network on LinkedIn.
- [Hold up list of movies, bucket of ice, and smile]
- 01100010 01101100 01100101 01100101 01110000 00100000 01100010 01101100 01101111 01101111 01110000

If you haven’t already reached the semester milestone of being notoriously behind on readings, then be prepared to have that procrastination hit you full force this Thursday. ShondaLand—Shonda Rhimes’ production company, and colloquially known as a block of time on Thursday when all three of her hit television shows run—is back this week. "Scandal," "How to Get Away With Murder," and "Grey’s Anatomy" all ended with breathtaking mid-season finales. If you even begin to think about skipping these premieres to go to the gym, do a p-set, or do anything evenly mildly productive, Flyby will find you and personally program your Philo account to run these shows on endless loop. Forever.
But seriously, ShondaLand is a big deal. Its return means that Kerry Washington as Olivia Pope, who has been off solving problems in the show’s hiatus, will be back with a vengeance. Will she stay true to her decision to break it off with Fitz? Or will she find herself drawn inexorably back to the man who she just can’t seem to shake off? If the trailers released for the premiere are in anyway indicative of the rest of this season’s plot, it seems that fans who have been wishing for Olivia Pope to finally break away from her forbidden love will be in for a disappointing ride.
Tune into Grey’s Anatomy at 8 p.m., Scandal at 9 p.m., and How to Get Away with Murder at 10 p.m.

Love is in the air in the days leading up to Valentine's Day, or at least in the form of filling out 31 questions in a survey and praying that you get matched with that cute guy you always lock eyes with at Greenhouse Cafe–that’s right, Datamatch is back!
For the newbie freshmen as well as the upperclassmen who have been living under a rock, Datamatch is a matchmaking service the Harvard Computer Society provides every year in time for Valentine’s Day. All you have to do is fill out an online survey that supposedly probes into your soul, and you’ll be emailed a list of compatible matches (and their contact info, score) on Valentine’s Day. It is an indisputable fact that Flyby loves Datamatch, and word on the street is that Datamatch is back and better than ever this year, so of course we had to find out for ourselves what exactly was going on. We sat down with Raynor J. Kuang ‘17, the “Fearless Leader” of Datamatch’s development team, to get the scoop on this (read: feel every so slightly more hopeful that we will not be binge-watching low-quality rom coms alone in our room with a sippy cup of Franzia come Sunday night).
Flyby: What are some new changes to Datamatch this year?
RJK: One of our big initiatives was to partner up with Satire V, because in the past, I ended up writing most of the survey questions myself and we thought it would make more sense to reach out to a humor publication. Satire V agreed to write a bunch of questions in exchange for pubbing them and their new book. We also have new partnerships this year– [in addition to] our partnership with Zinnekens, we’re also partnering with Clover, El Jefe’s, and Pinkberry. We’ll have a system where you can pick what restaurant you want to go to [once you and your match both agree to go on a date]. We’re also paying for people to go on two dates this year, one with their topmost match and the other with their bottom match.
Flyby: So how does the algorithm actually work?
RJK: Obviously I can’t tell you everything, but in years past, it became a joke that it was just random. We realized that this joke was actually harming Datamatch and people didn’t take it seriously. This year, we really worked to make it so that the algorithm compares and contrasts people. We reached out to Professor Steven Pinker to learn about the psychology of affection and the way people communicate and match up with each other. I hope people trust that it’s really something that takes into account how you fill out the survey.
Flyby: Have you heard of personal success stories from Datamatch?
RJK: Yes! One of my blockmates got his current girlfriend as a match last year. Seeing their relationship develop, Datamatch probably wasn’t the obvious cause, but maybe Datamatch knew something about each other that they didn’t. Our hashtag is #trustthesystem.
Flyby: Does the Datamatch team also participate in Datamatch?
RJK: Of course. Look out for me, I will click the waffle button for everyone that gets matched with me.
Flyby: Have you read our Flyby Datamatch series?
RJK: Yes, I love it. It really shows how easy it is to meet up with people through Datamatch. I only hope that everyone on Flyby gets waffle button-ed back.
Flyby: So can you rig the system for us to get the best dates, obviously only for high-quality journalism purposes?
RJK: My on-the-record response is, I’m sure the people of Flyby are so great that you’ll get great matches. (Thanks for the compliment, Raynor, but does that mean you’re rigging the system or not for us?) 
Flyby: Any tips for those filling out the Datamatch survey?
RJK: [When choosing answers], pick the one that first catches your eye–it’s the one you should pick, don’t really debate over whether it’s the “right” one or not. Also, fill out our new profile feature. Put a picture. Add a description. It’s nothing too probing and it creates a sense of humor. Don’t use the private setting so that friends can find you in the search bar. The hope in the search function is that you can find your compatibility with people you want to be matched with even if you don’t end up getting them.
Flyby: Any last words you want to tell people about Datamatch?
RJK: Around 2,300 people have signed up so far already, so be a part of the number and give into FOMO. The more people that do it, the more fun it is.
Finally, Kuang encourages love-seeking folks to reach out to hcsdatamatch@gmail.com with any questions. May the Datamatch odds be ever in your favor, Harvard.
