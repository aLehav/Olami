After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When in doubt, write a petition! This seems to be a mantra at Harvard, and as of last Monday, nearly 2,000 Harvard students have signed onto a new one calling for the restoration of hot breakfast to all upperclassmen dining halls. We can’t quite bring ourselves to sign on.
Undergraduates already have access to basic breakfast options across the Houses, including hot oatmeal, toast, and boiled eggs. Students who want more extravagant fare have Quincy House and Annenberg Hall available to them. As we’ve stated previously, we support expanding hot breakfast to a single house in each neighborhood (with an eye toward our long-suffering friends in the Quad), but we see no reason to insist on its return to every house.
College students aren’t known for the early hours they keep, and pouring money into the earliest meal of the day would likely be a waste. Most of us didn’t eat breakfast even when hot breakfast was universally available, and we don’t think its return will substantially change people’s decisions.
Students who do skip breakfast are restricted to eating their daily meals between 11:30, when lunch service across all Houses starts, and 7:30, when dinner in all Houses except Dunster ends. Such a narrow eight-hour interval brings us dangerously close to a type of intermittent fasting known as time-restricted eating. Too many students face an unsavory choice: Either restrict their eating to a short time span in a manner that could hurt their physical and mental health, or buy overpriced food in Harvard Square (which disproportionately burdens lower-income students) or from UberEats (which has its own ethical problems).
Instead of reintroducing hot breakfast in all the Houses — a program that cost roughly $900,000 per year before it was cut in 2009 — Harvard should invest money to expand and improve the existing food options. First and foremost, dining hall hours should be extended so that students’ dietary needs are better met; this includes shifting FlyBy hours so that students who have class all afternoon do not have to skip lunch. Harvard should also expand options for students with dietary restrictions, and should provide nutritious food at all meals — for example, fresh cut fruit and real berries to replace sugared strawberries and blueberries at breakfast. Such an improvement in nutritional quality should further extend to Brain Break options, which serve an essential purpose for students who get hungry while working for four, five, or six hours after the dining halls end dinner.
Beyond our doubts about the merits of hot breakfast, we also resent the hyperbolic argument advanced in the petition that Quincy Dining Hall staff are overwhelmed. It is doubtful that students wait in long lines outside Quincy clamoring for hot breakfast, as one HUDS employee claimed. We support HUDS workers, and if dining hall staff are truly overrun because of the demand for hot breakfast, then the administration should hire more staff; however, we do not need to see an expensive program — which would likely cost the University over a million dollars — reintroduced to our dining halls instead of more important reforms. Many of those million-plus dollars, we suspect, would be wasted on food that goes uneaten.
There is plenty that Harvard can do to better promote students’ wellbeing, and funding for such initiatives is not unlimited. Although we reaffirm our support for the expansion of hot breakfast to one House in each neighborhood, we would rather see money spent on extending dining hall hours and offering more nutritious options than on reintroducing a historically underused service within every House.
Hot breakfast would be nice! But there’s no such thing as a free lunch.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I was 11 years old when I found out I’d been mutilated. I was standing in the yellow light of the bathroom, feet clammy against the cold tile. Gut-churning feelings washed over me: confusion, disgust, and, most of all, violation. My body had been altered irrevocably without my consent. No one had ever told me; rather, an internet rabbit hole impersonally informed me that I could never live in the body in which I was originally born. I never had a say in it, because they had done it to me hours after I was born. The worst part of it all is that I’m not the only one in this situation — in fact, I’m far from alone. As of 2016, an estimated 71.2 percent of men in the United States are circumcised.
I understand that not every circumcised man thinks about this. Most either never consider the absurdity of their condition or are content with it. But it seems that these men would also be happy without being circumcised, as the majority of men throughout history have been.
For the millions of us who do feel the lack, what recourse is there? There’s no way to get back what was taken from us, and there’s hardly even a movement to rally behind. Harvard is full of socially conscious young people. Walking through the Yard, opinions fly left and right about reproductive rights, racism, Israel-Palestine, and more — a myriad of ideological battles waged daily through flyers, demonstrations, and walkouts. And yet, it seems we’ve missed this one: When it comes to circumcision, everyone acts like it’s normal.
In reality, it isn’t normal. America is the only major Western country to believe in and practice circumcision at such a high level. As of 2021, nearly half of Americans find routine infant circumcision acceptable, while another sizable proportion has no opinion either way. Conversely, in most European countries, less than 10 percent of men are circumcised.
Circumcising babies is wrong. Some have a perception that the practice is natural, yet the natural state of the body is not circumcised. Oftentimes, people cite medical benefits as reasons to circumcise; however, these benefits are marginal at best and unfounded at worst. Others say that the issue is exclusively the parents’ business, yet we generally agree that it’s wrong for parents to modify their children’s bodies in other ways, such as tattooing. Some religious populations, such as Jews and Muslims, argue that circumcising their children is ordained by their religion, but religious freedoms should naturally end where another person’s freedoms begin. The human rights to bodily autonomy and religious freedom should extend to every child, regardless of their parents’ religion; segments of the Jewish population in fact recognize this right and propose the Brit Shalom, an alternative naming ceremony that delays circumcision until the man is old enough to make the decision for himself.
To object to the mutilation of a baby boy’s penis should not be in any way radical. On the contrary, this objection seems like a natural product of human reason and compassion. So why do we remain content with circumcision?
It seems that a large part of the issue is the cycle of shame. Although the evidence is all freely available, we don’t talk about circumcision because it’s taboo. We’ve taken a widespread issue and convinced ourselves it’s private or shameful just because it’s inflicted on our genitals. Furthermore, conceptions of masculinity play a role. In order for a circumcised man to advocate against circumcision, he must first acknowledge that he was made a victim at the most vulnerable time in his life. Frankly, many men do not feel strong enough to admit this. And so the cycle continues, the issue is ignored or downplayed, and people inflict the same violence on their children for generations.
There are signs of hope. American infant circumcision rates have slowly but surely dropped in recent decades. With each successive generation, fewer parents believe that all male babies should be circumcised.
However, there’s still a lot more work to be done. To this day, 58.3 percent of baby boys born in America will be circumcised. Our generation has an affinity for shedding light on injustice, eschewing taboos, and discussing difficult issues. This Sex Week, Harvard undergraduates will come together in open discussion to change the culture of shame around our bodies and genitals. By also talking about circumcision, we can inspire the shift towards bodily autonomy for all.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the oral arguments for the affirmative action case, Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan made an important yet overlooked point about the future of higher education. She asked whether affirmative action’s rationale could justify favoring men in admissions:
“[T]here's a lot of statistical evidence that suggests that colleges now, when they apply gender-neutral criteria, get many more women than man…could a university put a thumb on the scales and say ‘it's important that we ensure that men continue to receive college educations at not perfect equality but roughly in the same ballpark’?”
Justice Kagan’s question didn’t come from nowhere. Colleges are increasingly facing a dearth of males: 60 percent of college students are female and they outnumbered male applicants last admissions cycle by a whopping 35 percent. Many are worried that this gender imbalance detracts from campus diversity and from the college experience overall. In response, some colleges have discretely started giving preference to male applicants, raising thorny questions surrounding the ethics of favoring a privileged group.
But does this educational gender gap apply to Harvard?
Yes and no — data reveals that our school is better positioned than most to recruit both qualified male and female applicants, but recent trends indicate that Harvard may eventually confront a shortage of qualified male applicants. This piece won’t wade into the philosophical debate of favoring applicants based on gender, but, like the rest of my column, this article hopes to shed light on an under-discussed topic by letting the numbers lead the way.
To start off, why are American males falling behind in higher education? Brookings Fellow Richard V. Reeves recently wrote a book called “Of Boys and Men” that focuses, in part, on this question. It turns out that the educational gender gap begins much earlier than college.
Girls enter elementary school more prepared than boys and this distance compounds over time. As a result, females go on to earn better grades and disproportionately make up the top of their high school graduating class.
So, by the time they apply to college, many boys have been lagging behind their female peers for decades, making them much less qualified on average. This is a large part of the reason why men make up a minority of college students, creating awkward imbalances at many schools. For example, Baylor accepted 7 percent more women than men last year, and men now make up only 41 percent of the University of California, Los Angeles’ student body.
This isn’t a new phenomenon. Women have been graduating college at higher rates than men for nearly 40 years. But more people are talking about it now because Covid-19 highlighted and worsened this trend: Roughly 70 percent of the Covid-19 college enrollment decline was due to males.
As with most problems in higher education, high-income schools like ours are able to shield themselves. We have so many qualified applicants – both male and female – that Harvard is able to mostly create a 1:1 gender ratio among its student body even while most colleges are struggling to do so.
But this trend may be unsustainable, and even Harvard may eventually have to break its 50-50 balance. Look at recent applications and admissions, which both display a growing divergence between the genders, indicating that the Harvard applicant pool may be starting to reflect national trends.
We shouldn’t over extrapolate on only two years of data, since this pattern could still reverse. Indeed, this higher education gender disparity has been present for decades, and Harvard has thus far been able to maintain a balanced student body.
But I think if colleges continue to see a dearth of male applicants, it may eventually spillover to substantially affect Harvard’s applicant pool, since the nation-wide educational gender gap seems to be only growing.
Many other selective colleges have already been affected. According to the Hechinger Report, both Vassar and Pitzer College recently received double the number of female than male applicants. A lopsided applicant pool begets lopsided admissions. Even at very-high ranked schools, like Brown, Pomona, and Vanderbilt, male admission rates have been consistently higher than females in the past two years. So, we should not think Harvard’s selectivity renders it immune to this trend.
If men begin to make up less than 40 percent of our applicants, what should Harvard do? I don’t have anything close to a definitive answer, but I’ll make three quick points.
First, we should be careful but principled in linking this issue to race-based affirmative action. If you are against race-conscious admissions because you believe each applicant should be treated solely as an individual rather than as a member of their identity group, you should be consistent in that belief when thinking about gender-conscious admissions.
Secondly, we shouldn’t interpret the educational gender gap as reflective of some broader change in male privilege. Despite men having been the minority in higher education for the past several decades, they still constitute the vast majority of CEOs and politicians.
Finally, beyond the questions of admissions, Harvard may need to think about how each gender requires different types of support from the school, since male students tend to be less engaged. Men in college study abroad less, hold student government offices less often, and take longer to graduate. My guess is that these trends don’t hold at Harvard – at least for the moment – since nearly everyone admitted here is ambitious, no matter their gender.
Even though the educational gender gap may not extend to Harvard yet, more people need to be thinking like Justice Kagan and asking about the future of men in higher education.

A team of scientists at Massachusetts General Hospital has developed a new tool that uses artificial intelligence to predict which patients are most likely to experience a recurrence of melanoma, the most deadly form of skin cancer.
The study — published on Oct. 31 in the npj Precision Oncology journal — was led by Harvard Medical School professor Yevgeniy R. “Eugene” Semenov, and Guihong Wan, an HMS research fellow.
To develop the tool, the researchers analyzed 1,720 early-stage melanomas from the Mass General Brigham healthcare system and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.
The research may lead to more effective treatment for patients in the early stages of melanoma, according to the study’s authors.
The “overwhelming majority of fatalities” stem from early-stage melanoma patients who do not have access to the “life-saving therapies” reserved for later-stage patients, Semenov said.
“Our, really, motivation was to try to understand, within this group of people who — quote-unquote — have early-stage disease, is there a way for us to tell which ones are going to get the more high risk for recurrence and progression from the ones who are not,” he said.
Wan explained that the tool could be used to identify who would benefit most from receiving immunotherapy at an earlier stage of their disease, allowing physicians to weigh the potential benefits of the treatment against its possible side effects.
“The tool possibly can be used to identify patients who may experience a recurrence,” she said. “Maybe they can receive the immunotherapy.”
Research on the recurrence of early-stage melanoma currently faces many limitations, including insufficient sample size, according to the paper’s authors.
“There have been other studies trying to do something similar to what we're doing, but they largely haven't focused on the earliest stage population. They looked at all the patients, including stage three patients, and they didn't really use large cohorts,” Semenov said. “So, for many reasons, there really hasn't been a comprehensive approach like the one we're leading.”
Utilizing data from “the entire healthcare system in Boston,” as well as “more reliable labeling,” the researchers were able to come up with more accurate models, Semenov said.
Beyond predicting early-stage melanoma recurrence, Semenov said there are many more potential applications of machine learning in healthcare.
“I think this is just the tip of the iceberg, and anyone who is in training now, I would heavily encourage really to start thinking about combining computational training with an interest in healthcare, because this sector is really going to explode and grow rapidly in the next 20, 30 years,” Semenov said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Belfer Center fellow Megan M. Turnbull, a comparative politics professor at the University of Georgia, discussed the conditions leading to election violence in Nigeria during a virtual seminar hosted by the Harvard Kennedy School on Thursday.
Turnbull, who is currently working on a book that further discusses political order and election violence, provided three “broad reasons” why election violence is important to scholars.
“It entails a good deal of human suffering,” Turnbull said. “From a scholarly angle, I think this book project advances the election violence literature in important ways, and then there’s also some policy relevance.”
During the seminar, Turnbull said she aimed to answer “the big overarching question in the book,” which explores under what conditions “political elites and non-state groups jointly organize election violence” in Nigeria.
Turnbull described election violence as a supply-demand relationship between political elites and non-state actors.
“On the demand side, election violence datasets show us that incumbents, politicians, are overwhelmingly the biggest perpetrators of violence during elections,” she said. “On the supply side, who is carrying out election violence on behalf of political elites?”
Turnbull said that, in the Nigerian context, governors and “powerful party leaders” — known as godfathers — are the political elites who create demand, while the supply side consists of non-state actors including “co-opted, incorporated, wannabe, and challenger groups.”
While co-opted groups are financially dependent on their political patrons, incorporated groups have “some autonomy and some leverage over politicians,” Turnbull said.
Turnbull defined “wannabe” groups as “aspiring incorporated groups,” which include smaller gangs and student groups.
“Their big incentive here is to try to carry out enough violence and generate enough insecurity during elections that they force politicians to open up patronage distribution networks and make them incorporated groups,” she said.
In contrast, challenger groups use election violence to “disrupt the political order and seek fundamental reform or even new political institutions,” according to Turnbull.
Turnbull, who conducted fieldwork in Nigeria from 2011 to 2019, said she pored over newspaper media and conducted interviews as part of her research. In her presentation, she described the 2003 gubernatorial election in Rivers State as “an incredibly violent election.”
“A big driving force in this violence was a conflict between Governor Peter Odili, who was up for reelection, and his former godfather Marshal Harry,” Turnbull said.
According to Turnbull, “elite conflict” between Odili and Harry — which stemmed from Odili backing out from his political affiliation with Harry — caused both politicians to turn to different groups to carry out violence for them. The conflict, which began with campaign disruption, led to Harry’s assassination just weeks before the election.
During the seminar, Turnbull said patronage — when politicians sponsor non-government groups at varying degrees — as the “primary or most important source of political power” can help scholars analyze election violence.
“Understanding how political order is constructed, maintained, and challenged can tell us a lot about who is organizing election violence, when, and why” she said.

Redist — a tool developed by Harvard undergraduates, graduate students, and faculty — could impact the fate of a Supreme Court case involving allegations of racial gerrymandering in Alabama.
The software application, which officially rolled out in 2020, uses statistics to identify gerrymandering in electoral districts, providing empirical evidence that can be introduced into court cases evaluating partisan or racial gerrymandering.
Kosuke Imai, a professor of government and statistics at Harvard, led the developer team in collaboration with American Civil Liberties Union data scientist Ben H. Fifield. The team also included Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences doctoral students Cory W. McCartan and Christopher T. Kenny, who developed a tool that runs simulations to determine whether a redrawn district is statistically abnormal.
The redist method differs from other gerrymandering identification tools, which typically compare outcomes between states without taking into account their differing political landscapes. The redist software prioritizes certain goals — like keeping counties together — in the drawing of district maps.
The algorithm is currently being used in Merrill v. Milligan, a lawsuit before the Supreme Court alleging Alabama’s 2021 congressional redistricting plan discriminates against Black voters.
Imai said the use of his tool in the Supreme Court case was surreal, as he typically produces work for use in academia, not the courtroom.
“When I saw the Supreme Court justices discussing our work, it was a moment where I never thought that would happen,” Imai said.
Fifield said the developers aim to “democratize” the software as much as possible, noting that redist is open source, meaning the code is available to anyone.
“A big part of the goal, especially with the open sourcing and making it more user-friendly, was so the general public could also use these tools and analyze redistricting plans,” Fifield said.
Though redist’s statistical approach was first introduced almost 10 years ago, Imai added that the algorithm has improved greatly since then, becoming “much more scalable” to the needs of medium and large states.
“The initial algorithms we developed were only applicable to very small states like New Hampshire,” Imai said. “It wasn't very applicable to medium or larger-sized states.”
The team also adapted the program to better visualize the simulations it runs.
“Chris Kenny and Tyler Simko both contributed to developing packages, software packages, which is really important because in order to use these algorithms in the court or the other settings you have to be able to communicate the results,” Imai said.
The team first applied this scaled-up version of redist to the 2020 elections. Currently, the team is analyzing the evolution of electoral districts since 2010.
Imai said he hopes to continue expanding analysis beyond the realm of U.S. elections. Already, the team is looking into applying the tool to international elections.
“Another project, with actually another undergraduate, evaluated in Japan, so we made a presentation to their national redistricting commission about some of our findings,” Imai said.
Imai said he was encouraged about redist’s impact on the future of election policy and redistricting in the United States.
“This really gave me the opportunity to be part of real-world policymaking, and I’m hoping that more opportunities like this will come along as the government and private entities start using our data and making data-driven policies,” he said.

After centuries roaming the streets of Harvard Square, Cambridge’s iconic turkeys may soon roost in new territory — Harvard Stadium.
A new Harvard Undergraduate Association initiative will allocate $1,000 toward piloting the turkey as Harvard’s new mascot in response to a perceived lack of school spirit. The Association voted in favor of the measure during its general meeting in Smith Campus Center’s Isaacson Room Sunday.
The body also solicited revisions to an open letter to the presidential search committee and announced a new working group on cost-accessible graduation celebrations.
During Sunday’s meeting, Felix B. Bulwa ’23 presented research on student-reported levels of school spirit and offered a potential solution: a new, feathered mascot. In a March survey conducted for the Harvard Political Review, over 70 percent of the 130 respondents supported a new mascot.
“What I found through my study was that we have a lot of spirit in subcommunities and subsections of campus,” Bulwa said at the meeting. “We are lacking that cross-sectional spirit that most other colleges, even Ivy League colleges, tend to have.”
Though Harvard’s athletic teams officially compete as the “Harvard Crimson,” the College’s official mascot is “John Harvard the Pilgrim” — a figure Bulwa called “problematic.” The turkey, Bulwa said, would not replace the “Crimson” branding ubiquitous throughout Harvard athletics, but rather interact with fans at sporting events.
To justify the choice of a turkey, Bulwa pointed to the bird’s prevalence on campus and compliance with Harvard’s color scheme. Roughly thirty-six percent of respondents to Bulwa’s survey rank the turkey as their top choice for a mascot. Lobster placed second.
The push for a turkey mascot is not new. A 2016 Facebook page solicited student signatures in favor of a turkey mascot to no success.
HUA Co-Presidents LyLena D. Estabine ’24 and Travis Allen Johnson ’24 endorsed the initiative, as did College Dean Rakesh Khurana at a recent meeting, according to the pair. Of the 16 voting students present at the meeting, 12 supported the piloting initiative and four were unopposed.
The Association will pilot the new turkey mascot at the Harvard-Yale tailgate and use the $1,000 allocation to purchase a turkey suit and promotional material.
At Sunday’s meeting, the Association established a new working group dedicated to promoting cost accessibility for graduation traditions, including class rings.
Harvard College currently offers no official class ring service, but an HUA-endorsed affiliate company, Balfour, offers custom rings for between $500 and $1,000.
The body also allocated $2,500 for the creation of goody bags to be distributed to students in early December during the final exam period.
HUA leaders closed the meeting by soliciting feedback on an open letter to the presidential search committee. The letter details student priorities for the next leader of the University.
In its current form, the letter asks the committee to select a candidate with a commitment to “diversity, equity, and inclusion,” “mental health,” and “intellectual vitality,” among other issues.

Linda Simpson, editor and publisher of My Comrade, spoke about her experience running the queer magazine during this fall’s Hofer Lecture on Thursday.
The lecture took place at Houghton library in honor of the library’s “American Drag” exhibition, which runs through January 2023. An issue of My Comrade is one of the first items displayed in the drag exhibit, where the lecture took place.
During the event, Simpson discussed her path to founding the magazine and bringing it to print.
My Comrade, which recently celebrated its 35th anniversary, was primarily circulated as an underground magazine — an independent or unofficial publication — during the 1980s and 1990s, when there was less acceptance of the queer movement.
Simpson said she was always interested in magazines, describing her adolescent self as a “magazine junkie,” and started My Comrade as a side endeavor to promote “gay power, love, and unity” while she worked a temporary job.
“We were all emboldened heroes of the gay liberation movement,” she said. “Most of all, it was a human magazine to brighten up people's lives.”
“It was more about the upbeat fun atmosphere, including everything special about a lot of gay-charged stuff,” she added.
Although Simpson called My Comrade a “humor magazine” for its lightheartedness, she said the magazine also aims to increase representation and awareness of the queer movement.
“Even the rumor of being gay could really hurt your career,” Simpson said, referencing the 1980s and 1990s. “Drag queens and like downtown celebrities had to kind of take up the slack — we were the most invisible members of the gay world.”
The magazine profiled drag queens and queer celebrities, creating its own alternative “star system” to parallel more mainstream A-list celebrities.
“The visibility that we provided — even if it was, you know, just for ourselves or like a smaller group of people — was very important,” she said.
Simpson, who lived in the East Village of Manhattan, collaborated with her friends who provided writing and art content which she would then compile into the magazine.
“In that part of the downtown East Village scene there were a lot of creative people, so I knew a lot of photographers and illustrators and writers,” she said
Simpson later added Sister — which focused on queer female representation rather than “male-centric” drag — to the flip side of the magazine.
“I certainly wanted lesbians and women to be involved, so that seemed like a good way of inviting people in,” Simpson said.
In revival issues, Sister has been integrated into My Comrade.
Matthew Wittman, curator of the Harvard Theatre Collection, said the next exhibit at the Houghton Library will also feature Simpson’s My Comrade.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Seven members of Harvard’s Class of 2023 have been selected as Rhodes Scholars to pursue postgraduate studies at the University of Oxford.
Six Harvard students — Tessa K.J. Haining ’23, Isaac A. Robinson ’22-’23, Lauren Kim ’23, Henry A. Cerbone ’23, Brian H. Wee ’23, and Amisha Kambath ’22-’23 — were awarded the U.S. scholarship, the American secretary of the Rhodes Trust announced Saturday. They join Marcus B. Montague-Mfuni ’23, who was awarded a South African Rhodes Scholarship last week.
The prestigious award, established in 1902, allows students globally to pursue postgraduate study at Oxford. This year, 2,500 students applied in the U.S. for 32 allotted slots.
For the fourth straight year, Harvard College produced the most American Rhodes Scholars. Yale had the second most this year, with five.
Harvard has produced 385 American Rhodes Scholars since the first Americans received the prize in 1904, followed by Yale with 263.
This year’s application cycle marked the third straight year students from the U.S. participated in the application process virtually, but it resumed in-person for some regions globally. Montague-Mfuni, a Crimson Editorial editor who serves as the newspaper’s Diversity and Inclusivity chair, had to fly between the U.S. and South Africa.
Finalists from each of the 16 Rhodes Scholarship districts in the U.S. met over Zoom on Saturday for a final round of interviews. The finalists remained in a Zoom room together for hours as deliberations occurred.
“We had some really good conversations that covered a lot of different facets of life,” said Brian H. Wee ’23, a Chemical and Physical Biology and Government concentrator who lives in Lowell House. “We ended up making origami as well, using different tutorials that we found on the web.”
Once the recipients for a district had been decided, the deliberators announced the two recipients on the call.
“I think my entire body just kind of clenched and then immediately after my thought was, ‘Did I hallucinate my name?’” said Amisha A. Kambath ’22-’23, a Social Studies concentrator who lives in Dunster House. “Immediately the next question was, ‘Oh, my God, I don’t know how to verify they actually did say my name.’”
Tessa K. J. Haining ’23, a Chemistry and Comparative Literature concentrator in Adams House, said her first thought was to tell her parents.
“Even as much of an adult as you think you are, you’re always still there just wanting to tell your parents,” she said.
Recipients said the application process provided an opportunity to reflect on their own character and motivations.
“It firmed up a lot of my own thoughts and feelings on what I wanted to study and the direction I wanted to go,” said Montague-Mfuni, a Dunster House resident who concentrates in Psychology.
Henry A. Cerbone ’23, an Adams House resident pursuing a special concentration in the Ontology of Autonomous Systems, said the process of pursuing a special concentration was helpful when applying for the Rhodes Scholarship.
“When you apply for a special concentration, you really have to have a pretty definite sense of self,” he said. “The wonderful folks at the Office of Special Concentrations make sure that you have that sense of self and I think that that’s really useful for Rhodes.”
The seven students will study a range of fields at Oxford, from Biology to History of Science, Medicine, and Technology.
Lauren Kim ’23, a Chemistry concentrator in Eliot House, said that as a prospective medical school applicant, she wants to spend her time as a Rhodes Scholar understanding medicine “from more than just a scientific angle.”
“I want to study medical anthropology at Oxford to sort of talk to people from other disciplines about how they see health care sort of fitting into their profession and their lives,” she said.
The students will start their studies in the UK in fall 2023.
“I still have to finish my topology p-set, so some things never change,” said Isaac A. Robinson ’22-’23, a Math and Computer Science concentrator in Eliot House. “Nothing fundamentally different from yesterday. Everyone’s the same person. The world goes on, but it’s definitely a good cause for reflection.”
The Rhodes Trust will announce awards from its remaining constituencies across the globe in the coming weeks. Last year, two Harvard students received the Canadian Rhodes Scholarship.

In September 2022, I made the monumental decision to transcend my lowly status as a NARP by signing up for the Boston Half Marathon. Tired of people scootering around me, I decided I would in fact become the scooter itself — the scooter-ee would surpass the scooter. But beyond that and the general masochism that comes with being a Chemistry concentrator, this was also something my running-fanatic mother pressured me into doing with her.
I wouldn’t call myself a running noob, having run casually by the river whenever I needed to forget my life whenever the weather is nice, but I’d never run more than five miles at a time before this. Despite my lack of experience, I finished happy and smiling this Sunday (yay!!). I know you didn’t ask, but here are 13.1 things I wish I knew before racing. I’m telling you so that you too have all the information you need to feel a sense of athleticism, testosterone, and moral superiority the next time section kid interrupts you.
1. Following a training plan makes life easy.
I’m cripplingly indecisive to the point that I’ll spend five minutes looking at the Barker Café menu which has a total of about six hot drinks on it. Training plans alleviate the stress of deciding your mileage for that day/week!
2. Training requires a certain level of commitment. 
My class schedule didn’t allow for afternoon training, so early morning wakeups were necessary in order to get the requisite mileage in. Long runs require even more time plus recovery so be prepared to intentionally carve out time in your schedule to accommodate!
3. But it’s also not over if you miss a day — listen to your body!
If your body hurts in a way that’s deeper than muscle soreness, skip a day of training! Alternatively, if your body hurts in a way from going too hard at Tasty Basty the night before, skip a day of training! It’s not the end of the world and is ultimately beneficial in the long run.
4. Cross-training
To avoid injury, I braved the sweaty pits of the Mather gym to get my weekly lifts in. But the benefits of lifting didn’t mean the task was enjoyable.
5. Podcasts are vibes
During long runs, I listened to a lot of podcasts. Like a lot. Also a good way to listen to lectures that you definitely 100% did attend.
*Note from the editor: it’s true — ESD listens to a lot of true crime, and then becomes truly scared. 
6. A watch is very, very helpful!
I stole borrowed my sister’s watch where I could track my mileage and pace which was helpful for….
7. Pacing yourself
When racing, it’s easy to get caught up in the adrenaline. Especially since the Boston Half is so hilly, I found it important to maintain a steady pace in the downhills to preserve my legs for the literal six-mile uphill segment that closed out the race. Still easier than a physics pset.
8. If it rains, let it rain.
Sounds like a proverb but no. You’re going to get wet anyways, and wearing a shell on top of your running gear may lead to overheating.
9. Soak in the crowd but also do bring earbuds
Nothing can beat a crowd on race day, but also nothing can beat the pure rush of fear and adrenaline when a Pitbull song comes on. Choose your poison.
10. Know your course
I didn’t know how hilly the Boston course was until about three weeks before the actual race and had been training on flat ground up until that point. Then in sheer panic, I ran hills every single day until the race. 1/10 would not recommend. Do your research.
11. Practice fueling
Similar to common mantras heard on weekend evenings, my mantra after drinking the race Gatorade was a stream of “Don’tthrowupdon’tthrowupdon’tthrowup”s. Practice fueling during training runs to train your stomach to take in fuel.
12. Carb loading
Could be fake but could also be helpful. I used it mostly as an excuse to indulge in some good good bread but found myself surprisingly energized during the race.
13. HAVE FUN!
The most cliché of all clichés, but the race was genuinely so fun! Seeing all the spectators and running with friends made the experience one I’ll definitely remember forever :)
13.1 Your pre-race poops are *probably* just out of excitement. Don’t poop.

It’s that time of year again when we reflect on all the things we’re grateful for — and there’s a lot to be grateful for: friends, family, HUDS sweet potato fries, and even that section kid who mansplains talks all the time but also makes sure you’re never called on so you don’t have to pretend like you did the reading.
Whether you’re looking for some casual listening to put yourself in a ~grateful~ mindset, or you just need something to blast in your airpods at Thanksgiving Dinner to tune out that relative who can’t stop talking about her secret casserole recipe, Flyby has you covered. Because, dear reader, we’re grateful for you too — so Thank U (Next).
