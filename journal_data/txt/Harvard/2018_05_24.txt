After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s said that there are two plots in all of fiction: Either someone goes on a journey or a stranger comes to town. In “Hot Summer Nights,” Elijah Bynum’s directorial debut, gawky, surly Daniel Middleton (Timothée Chalamet) is both journeyer and stranger. During the sweltering summer of 1991, before his senior year, Daniel’s acts of rebellion after his father’s death earn him a summer of exile to his aunt’s house in Cape Cod, a punishment that even he admits is cliché. There, he befriends Hunter Strawberry (Alex Roe), a townie who makes pocket change by dealing weed to tourists, and becomes infatuated with the enigmatic McKayla (Maika Monroe), a local girl-next-door who is as elusive as she is beautiful. As temperatures climb, a fact often reiterated by spliced-in news reports and radio announcements, so does Daniel’s restlessness. He demands that he and Hunter take the weed-dealing business to the next level, procuring larger and larger quantities to sell. But as the summer wears on and the heat wave reaches a breaking point—culminating in a heavily symbolic summer storm—the teenagers in Cape Cod will have to reckon with what they’ve done, and decide who should be held accountable.
In his directorial debut, Elijah Bynum deftly establishes a riveting tableau of small-town Northeastern Americana—there are “townies” and “summer birds,” the haves and the have-nots clearly demarcated by socioeconomic checkpoints: who’s driving what car, who’s living in what neighborhood, and most saliently, who’s smoking the expensive stuff. It’s also a vivid portrait of American adolescence at a particular time in history, a time when football stars held court over scrawny geeks before popularity was meted out by Instagram followers. “Hot Summer Nights” has the makings of a promising drama—but by its third act, lackluster performances by its young stars (save Timothée Chalamet, who artfully straddles nerd anxiety and reckless ambition) and a formulaic plot resolution sabotage its effort to be anything more than another teen soap opera, obviously imagined by an adult who wants to sit with the cool kids.
“Hot Summer Nights” is, at times puzzlingly and sporadically, narrated by an anonymous 13-year-old who claims that all of this was based on a true story. There’s something mythic about the local folklore, with rumors of drug dealing and a character named “Hunter Strawberry.” Bynum, who grew up in Massachusetts, tells the story like an insider to this community: We’re already well-acquainted with the 13-year-old who knows everything about the older kids, from the salacious details of the dream girl’s entire romantic history to the local teenage drug dealer’s rep for rebellion (“I heard he drove a motorcycle,” says one character conspiratorially, while another ventures a darker guess: “I heard he killed a man”). Less familiar to us are the dream girl and the drug dealer themselves, and Monroe’s and Roe’s opaque, impassive performances—like cringeworthy audition tapes come to life—don’t humanize their characters, which are already flimsy sketches of 3D people. It doesn’t help that Bynum’s screenplay features the maudlin dialogue of a Lifetime movie: A cop pulls Daniel over “mysteriously” to deliver the cryptic fortune cookie slogan, the film in microcosm: “Happens every summer. The stars feel like they’re burning out above you. When the air’s so heavy you can’t breathe, nights turn long and sleepless, and you long for cooler times. You know what it is? It’s gonna tear you apart.” The sentiment, though evocative and literary, feels out of place. Even Daniel looks confused: Is this monologue a preface to a speeding ticket or just a spontaneous roadside poetry reading?
Lucky for Bynum, there’s at least one actor in “Hot Summer Nights” who can deliver those lines with conviction, and he’s the film’s leading man, fresh off a 2017 Oscar nomination for “Call Me By Your Name.” Timothée Chalamet saves the second half of the film from entirely becoming tropey mush. As Daniel, Chalamet is endearing, even when he’s not supposed to be—he fidgets under anyone’s gaze, punches above his weight, and even messes up a dad joke on its first telling (so unfunny it’s a little bit funny). Upon rescuing McKayla from a date at a drive-in theater, he struggles to play it cool: “He looked like a real asshole,” he says of her date.
“How do you know that?” she asks.
“He was eating Raisinets,” Daniel replies. “Food of assholes.”
For a film that tries to toe the boundaries of its genre, though, “Hot Summer Nights” features a protagonist who’s likable in a surprisingly formulaic way. Daniel is a scrappy, well-meaning, American boy borne out of the entrepreneurial spirit: a Horatio Alger character of his generation. What sets Daniel apart from the rest of the townies and summer birds, what makes his arrival in Cape Cod so momentous, is his insatiable craving for more. When he’s told the clients won’t buy higher quantities of weed, his reaction isn’t resignation, but dogged persistence. “How can we make them want to?” he asks.
With textbook-archetypal characters and an easily foreseeable plot, “Hot Summer Nights” tends, like its protagonist, to crumble under its own ambition, devolving from originality into the territory of convention and formula. Though perhaps Bynum’s adherence to narrative tradition is somewhat gratifying, and even somewhat fitting. Thematically, even narratively, comparisons to “The Great Gatsby” wouldn’t be misplaced: While the film feels like a portrait of 1992, it’s actually nostalgic for a much older America. Characters park their cars at drive-in movies on Kennedy turf, and old-school class distinctions are stringently observed. Like Nick and Gatsby, Daniel and Hunter party hard, then crash hard; they struggle to evade the reckoning of the future; they are careless and impulsive, experiencing every emotion in its most visceral and urgent strain, then waking up the next morning to wonder if it was all a fever dream. It’s a fascinating energy for the film to command, but one that peters out, as unsustained as a passing heat wave.

“The negative just makes for a better story: the plane was delayed, an infection set in, outlaws arrived and reduced the schoolhouse to ashes. Happiness is harder to put into words.” David Sedaris has never been afraid of making dark jokes and his latest collection of short stories, “Calypso,” is no exception to this trend. Although Sedaris is known for this type of humor, the collection’s focus on his family—particularly his deceased mother and sister as well as his aging father—makes these tough jokes hard to stomach at times. Amid the darkness is the same wit that Sedaris always brings to his stories and although the difficult subjects are hard to read with this humor interlaced throughout, “Calypso” is perhaps Sedaris’ most raw collection.
Sedaris is gifted with a wit that can take some of life’s most pressing questions and turn them into a gut-busting joke. He ponders why Christians feel the need to portray Jesus as perfectly handsome. “What would happen, I often wonder, if someone sculpted a morbidly obese Jesus with titties and acne scars, and hair on his back?” And while to some degree he is making fun of the practice, he’s also hinting at a larger point. “Doing good deeds doesn’t make you good-looking.” Sedaris wraps these important societal questions in hilarious quips and dirty jokes, but the weight of them remains nonetheless.
What makes “Calypso” different from Sedaris’ other collections are the themes he has chosen to focus on, mainly his family. He uses his beach house in Emerald Isle, named Sea Section, as a home base since during his childhood Sedaris’ family would annually rent a condo in Emerald Isle and as adults the remaining members congregate at the Sea Section. Many of his stories begin and end here, but veer off on tangents about childhood Emerald Isle trips or memories of family.
Family is no easy task to write about, especially for Sedaris. “Now We Are Five,” the second story in the collection, begins: “In late May 2013, a few weeks shy of her fiftieth birthday, my youngest sister, Tiffany, committed suicide.” Yet the story departs from this somber tone at times, discussing the purchase of the Emerald Isle beach house and the reinstatement of family vacations to the beach. Other stories, such as “Why Aren’t You Laughing?” and “The Comey Memo,” explain his complicated relationships with his parents. Sedaris discusses how much he and his siblings doted on their mother, yet no one addressed her alcoholism. He recounts arguments with his aging father that are hilarious, but also upsetting as Sedaris tries so hard to connect when the two have very little in common. Sedaris family stories are almost always funny, but the humor seems to come at a price.
Underneath the humor is heartbreak, such as when Sedaris ponders about his sister’s death, “Doesn’t the blood of every suicide splash back in our faces?” It is lines like these that stray from his usual and may be too much to bear for Sedaris’ usual reader looking for a good laugh. These emotional moments add depth to his writing. This collection is a departure from Sedaris’ norm due to this newfound darkness, which is surprising for an author who is known for his particularly dark humor.
This is Sedaris’ most personal collection of stories, which sometimes make it difficult to handle his darker jokes. However, it provides more information about the author than ever before. Sure, his past writings have told of his various travel stories or crazy neighbors in the many cities he has lived in. “Theft By Finding” was years worth of journal entries, describing the times spent making ends meet and getting drunk or high whenever possible. But “Calypso” explores personal family dynamics that have only been briefly mentioned in the past, making this collection more tender and more painful than his others.

The one question I was asked more than any other during my time at Harvard as a Fall 2017 Residential Fellow at the Kennedy School Institute of Politics was whether getting involved in politics still matters, and if so, how? Granted, it can be hard at times to stay focused on what really matters in the wake of the daily tweet storms that now seem to govern our lives.
Just ten years after the excitement of electing our nation’s first African American president, we’ve gone from “Change we can believe in” to “Make America Great Again.” We are struggling to redefine our identity and protect our democracy as we grapple with a period of profound disruption and social change. As a country, we are more divided along racial, ideological, technological, and social lines than ever before. But that’s why your voices and your talents are needed in civic engagement and public service more now than ever before. As President John F. Kennedy ’40 once said, “We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard….” Public service is about solving problems, making people’s lives better, and meeting the challenges of our time. It’s about setting big goals, doing big things, and envisioning big ideas, especially when it seems hard to do so. Now is your generation’s time to lead. As in so many times before in our nation’s history, women, people of color and young people—the most diverse generation ever—are leading in this shift from moment to movement. You are building political power, influencing policy, and making change. You are making your voices heard not just protesting, but also innovating. From the political parties to the establishment organizations across the political spectrum, you are challenging the status quo and literally creating new pathways for people across our country to get involved, volunteer, make their voices heard, and run for office. Yours is the generation that would not be counted out in 2008: You voted in large numbers and elected Barack Obama president. Still the pundits said you were unreliable, and again in 2012 you were decisive, and then you showed up in record numbers in 2016. And now you are about to become the largest living generation of adults in America and the largest voting block in our country.
As President Barack Obama said, “Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that we seek”. Quite literally, your voices, your vote, and your activism can and will shape this next chapter of America’s journey. From Indivisible, Color of Change, Voto Latino, Onward Together, Run for Something to Higher Heights and too many more to list here, there are numerous ways to make your voices heard and make your vote count.
But you are needed to shape this next chapter for the better. This election year alone, America may once again see a fundamental realignment of American politics, as more than 30,000 women from diverse backgrounds all across our country at every level of government are running for office. Many of them have never before run for political office. Each of them needs help in their campaigns, and if they win they will need the next generation of staffers, supporters and political operatives to help ensure their success. If you choose to use your power to help these women get elected and rise, you will have again created a fundamental realignment in politics.So the question for each of you as you go on to the next phase in your life is how will you use your voice, your vote, and your activism? You can run for office or work for a cause you care about, a person you respect, or an issue that inspires you. Work hard and volunteer your time, and, as my generation said, “Just do it”. Your country is counting on you.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A true confession: I didn’t read any advice pieces about graduating from the College until I was in my mid-thirties, so I don’t expect many of you to read this now. At this stage of your life, you have achieved what only a ridiculously few people on the planet have accomplished. You feel proud. You feel powerful. You feel immortal. (All good feelings, by the way.) So I won’t take it personally if you don’t really care what some guy who came to Cambridge in 1986 with an electric typewriter has to say. I get it. It’s cool.
But promise me this: Read the rest of this piece 10 years from now. Or 20. Or maybe even 30. Because at some point in your life, you will run into a obstacle that will feel unpassable, and you will begin to ask yourself, “What was this Harvard degree all about? Was it even worth it?”
When you do hit that obstacle (and sorry to reveal—you will hit an obstacle), there are always tools that will get you through it. Some of them will be related to your Harvard experience, while others will not. Knowing that there is often more to know than just what you’ve learned here is the first lesson of graduating from Harvard.
While you may think that Harvard is the center of the universe right now, it’s not, and it will never will be. For every Harvard alum or former roommate who will be there to help you, many other  Harvard alums or former roommates will not. Add that to this reality: Graduating at Harvard can be like playing for the New England Patriots. Sure, you will have many of fans who marvel at your success, but the haters are often more numerous.
So be ready.
Be ready to feel embarrassed, out of place, disconnected, and even ashamed of your Harvard degree. Because in this world, there are more people who want to compete against you and see you fail than who want to support you. It will feel really lonely at times, and it might even feel like you will never be able to succeed again. And no Harvard degree (mine in is still up in my attic) will make it magically disappear.
Some of the friends who will graduate with you this week? You might not see them again for years, even in this age of digital connection. You might be seeking help from them before realizing they may not want to help.
And that’s okay. It’s more than okay.
It took me about 20 years to realize that Harvard was a special place for me in my life, so don’t expect me to push the myth that once you leave Harvard, all is taken care of. It’s not. In the universe of overachieving “type A” Harvard graduates (yes, it’s fine to be honest about this), issues of not “fitting in” because of who you are or where you come from still hit home. Harvard is a powerful place, an institution that can prop you up but also swallow you whole and make you into a marginalized impostor.
So if (and when) you read this, there are plenty of us so-called “successes” who doubted themselves at Harvard and never felt as if the University ever cared. It might not be a popular opinion to write about in public for Commencement issue, but it’s true.
Harvard can take you places, but it will never replace who you are. It can mold you, but it will never fully become you.
Nobody can ever take that away from you, and as much as many of us struggle to live up to the “Harvard Way” (whatever that means), we all find our place. For some, it takes minutes (money and privilege help). For others, it takes years. I choose to be with those who chose to take years. We are more fun at parties.
In all seriousness, don’t pressure yourself. Enjoy the now. Savor each and every day. Help others with no expectations, and don’t expect to figure it all out. I am about to turn 50, and I still don’t know what I want in life, but I do know that the biggest blessings are in the journey and not in the outcome.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As I contemplate my life after Harvard, I am glad that a friend, actually a Harvard classmate, last week suggested I read a Wall Street Journal article entitled “In Defense of the Not-So-Busy Retirement.” Because these are largely uncharted waters I am entering, I find myself hungry for any kind of advice. In the article, the author David J. Ekerdt posits that my generation, in leaving work behind, often falls prey to cultural norms of busyness and sometimes does not embrace a role of “seeking” connections alongside one of  “doing.” He points to the potential satisfactions of rekindling old relationships and bringing one’s attention to things one possesses: “In revisiting these belongings, what will come into focus is the person you were, are, and yet want to be.” What a great thought.
I have to admit that when I graduated from Harvard fifty-one years ago, I feared that relationships begun here would languish, given the different directions in which classmates were moving. Of course, we did not have the tools of electronic communication to support our efforts to stay in touch. Staying in touch required a strong commitment and intentional planning. We did a fairly decent job. For example, several friends and I created what we call “the Roundtable”—an annual, long weekend for good conversation, good exercise, and good food. It is a tradition that has survived decades, and I strongly encourage members of the Class of 2018 to create similar ways of staying connected. Such events are easy enough to plan: The hosting gets shared, and everyone has periods of time off from work. What you prioritize is your decision: We put the emphasis on meaningful discussion—about our own lives at work and at home, significant relationships, dreams and regrets, and the ever-changing condition of the world. It may sound hokey, but we have also gotten in the habit of circulating a draft agenda in advance in order to focus our attention and not feel after meeting that we had ignored something important.
Another way of staying in touch has been the reunions hosted by Harvard every five years. Even though most of my working life has been at Harvard, I have made a point of attending these. I hope that graduating seniors will give thought to doing the same. Whatever your experience in the College has been, you have shared a common base and been formed by both institutional events and happenings in the world beyond these gates. It is fascinating to catch up at intervals and see the different paths people have trod and learn from their reflections and aspirations. Now, I can’t say reunions have all been the same. After the first five or ten years out, it seemed to me there was a bit of competitiveness in the conversations. Someone sharing that he or she had just risen to the vice-president rank might be given a business card in return indicating senior vice-president status. (Time to summon the advice of Faculty of Arts and Sciences dean Michael D. Smith at Convocation: Don’t compare, connect!) But with succeeding reunions and the inevitable bumps people encounter—like deaths or divorces in the family and cherished jobs lost—people seemed eager to put it all out there and to provide support for one another. And it is not just connecting with old friends but making new ones at reunions that is so immensely satisfying.
At my 50th reunion last spring, much of the catching up had to do with issues regarding health (what we called the “organ recital”) and retirement. We were well prepared for those conversations because we had  been asked once again—a five-year ritual—to compose personal reflections or other writings for the reunion report which was sent to us in advance of our getting together. I hope this year’s seniors will, when the time comes in five years, begin to participate in that tradition. The writing causes one to look inward, and reading others’ accounts of their lives sheds new light on our evolving selves.
I started this piece looking ahead personally from June 2018 and at what I learned recently from David Ekerdt’s musings about retirement. I certainly get the value of rekindling old relationships—staying in better touch now that there is more free time. About possessions, I had an amazing jolt reading my Harvard classmate Ian Benham’s write-up for the 50th reunion report. Ian, who was someone I met for the first time last spring, wrote about going through old possessions, “sitting before an array of decrepit cardboard boxes,” probably pulled from the cellar or attic of his house. Because of its powerfulness, I quote from his report:
“Then, somewhere near the bottom, the photo emerges, carefully enclosed in a parched, brown-edged envelope without stamp, date, or name. The figure looks out at me, stationary, opaque, without emotion or intent. Possibly a name on the back, but no trace of identity. Looks rather like an early Arbus, but a hundred years before her time, perhaps more.
"I sit mute before her, unconnected with this ancestor, the boundaries of my memory now reached, all time earlier than this now gone. Not that I am without curiosity about her—but we are at an impasse. What more can I now know of her, where she fits into the family narrative, why, indeed, she was in the box at all? I could embark down many avenues, hoping to bring her back, to fill out her face, to account for the sadness in her eyes. But that would only distract from my recognition that memory is finite, that even with the technologies of their time—now so laughingly archaic—I cannot hear her laughter; cannot know if she became quick of temper with the antics of small boys, or sang when she would comb her daughter’s hair; whether she smelled of fresh bread as a mother, or of candlewax when she grew old. All I have is a bleak face confronting me, in silence.
"But there is more.
"I realize that one day I will become this figure. I will sit in silent confrontation before a descendant perhaps a hundred or two hundred years hence. My archaic image will appear laughable in its turn, the opacity of the encounter just as complete. The living will look upon me and realize that they are now the ones with failing memory, that they have no idea of who I was, nor why some intervening ancestor should have decided that this image of me should be preserved.”
I feel gratitude for the people with whom I attended Harvard, for the chance to meet some as much as fifty years later, and for the opportunity to be enriched by their stories. With Ian’s priceless description, I have a somewhat new perspective on retirement, and incentive, not only to revive old friendships, but to begin the process of going through things, hoping to capture a better understanding of where and who I’ve been, and as David Ekerdt writes, “yet want to be”—a task to be undertaken with both curiosity, which ignites our learning, and with humility.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past year has seen issues of diversity, inclusion, and belonging at the forefront of much campus conversation. Most overtly, the release of the Presidential Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging’s final report, a culmination of a year and a half of work, brought to campus “Four Goals” toward which the University should strive, “Four Tools” with which it should do so, and eight specific recommendations regarding how Harvard should proceed.
We believe the changes the Task Force proposes are, by and large, positive for our campus. While relative merits of specific measures can and should be debated, and much of the burden for creating lasting change falls not on the administration but the rest of campus, the Task Force contributes to important conversations and outlines courses of action to make our campus more welcoming—an aim with which few would take umbrage.
In its vision of a more diverse and inclusive campus, the University must direct the campus conversations and policies it oversees to make every effort to be inclusive of all identities. This is no easy task, as many individuals have intersectional identities. Further complicating the matter, different identities, either within or between individuals, can compound each other or come into conflict. In that vein, reformers must look beyond well-discussed axes of diversity to ensure their proposals take into account the complexities of the individuals affected.
Much of the conversation surrounding diversity and inclusion at Harvard has been dominated by issues of race and gender. For instance, while the Task Force commendably examines a variety of ways in which our campus is diverse in the 82 pages of its final report, its “Where Matters Stand” overview looks at the issue in terms of just three metrics: race, gender, and international status. While we should always strive for more conversation that focuses on addressing the unquestionably salient issues of racial and gender identity, approaches seeking to foster diversity, inclusion, and belonging at Harvard should be more comprehensive. They should take into consideration issues for important identities that go beyond race and gender, such as religion, political ideology, ability, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and many more that are not easily classifiable. To truly become the diverse and excellent community to which the Task Force aspires to be, our framework must incorporate as many areas of difference as possible.
Underscoring the importance of this multifaceted approach, several events this past year regarding the many intersecting identities and beliefs of students, faculty, and staff have dominated campus discourse. They point to the inevitable conclusion that it is impossible to make every member of the Harvard community feel completely welcome all of the time.
However, we should make an effort to approach this ideal. In that vein, areas that increase inclusivity along one measure of diversity that do not have adverse implications for others should be uncontroversially prioritized. By way of example, we have called for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences to ensure that in renewing undergraduate House life, it makes renewed Houses accessible to people of all physical ability statuses. For its part, the Task Force has listed the identification of “accessible spaces, routes, and sites” under its recommendation of the creation of “Inclusive Symbols and Spaces.” Outlining where this campus is most physically accessible and making it even more so through renovations such as new elevators and ramps will not have any adverse effects regarding other identities. Budgetary issues allowing, no one is disadvantaged by these initiatives, so they can and must come to fruition.
Unfortunately, not every series of initiatives can be this harmonious. This is in no small part because identities will clash, as this year’s controversies have shown.
For example, the Christian group Harvard College Faith and Action pressured a student to step down from her leadership role upon learning she was in a same-sex relationship. This event raised questions of which should be preserved more stringently—the freedom of religious beliefs or the principle of non-discrimination based on sexual orientation. HCFA also faced controversy this year by inviting self-proclaimed “ex-gay” speaker Jackie Hill-Perry to its weekly meeting.
More recently, Harvard employee Eric Clopper provoked outrage in his one-man show at Sanders Theatre, “Sex and Circumcision: An American Love Story,” by making anti-Semitic claims, such as that of the perceived “demonstrably evil influence” of Judaism in the United States. Clopper defended his freedom of expression and the ideal of ideological diversity, while detractors accused him of bigotry.
When identities and beliefs clash in this way, not every individual or group will be satisfied with the outcome of University administrative decisions, as some people will feel less secure in some of their identities than others. However, when Harvard must restrict one aspect of diversity to promote another, it should do so alongside clear reasoning as to which values the University has decided to prioritize and why it has done so.
Furthermore, when Harvard is challenged with choosing which priorities should take precedence, we have held that issues of nondiscrimination should generally be prioritized. We said that HCFA’s freedom of religion in the context of the College does not extend to authority to pressure a woman to resign her leadership position over her decision to date another woman. The goal of expanding the conversation to include more aspects of diversity is to be inclusive of more identities in the aggregate.
That said, much more work is needed in expanding the conversation and prioritizing ideological diversity on campus. Startlingly, just around 1.5 percent of respondents to The Crimson news staff’s survey of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences identify as conservative or very conservative, compared to 83.2 percent who identify as liberal or very liberal.
These statistics do not reflect America: 35 percent of Americans identify as conservative, 23 times the fraction of the faculty survey’s respondents, and 26 percent identify as liberal. This stark divide has harmful effects on the University’s ability to train our nation’s leaders, and it risks alienating current and potential conservative students. It has also likely contributed to the declining trust of Americans in higher education, which has deleterious effects. Much more work is needed to make this important element of diversity a priority. We believe the University must emphasize hiring professors with diverse beliefs and backgrounds who can challenge prevailing campus ideas through tough ideological conversations.
Increasing ideological diversity—and making students who may disagree with mainstream campus ideas more welcome—should be worked toward beyond merely hiring intellectually diverse faculty, however. Initiatives to promote campus conversations in which beliefs are questioned should be encouraged, as should giving students the resources they need to feel comfortable but not unchallenged in their identities. By doing so, we expand the diversity conversation to make as many students feel as welcome as we can.
These are not easy aims. Increasing ideological diversity will protect people who believe in ideas that others would call discriminatory. Additionally, the University’s financial status may impede worthwhile initiatives from the funding they need to prosper. Nonetheless, there is much to gain by promoting campus diversity and inclusivity, advancing uncontroversial initiatives, and prioritizing nondiscrimination. In doing so, we make our campus as welcoming to as many as possible—with positive implications for everything from the state of campus discourse to the perception of the University outside of its gates. Although increasing how welcoming Harvard is has value in and of itself, in the language of the Task Force’s report, once this “foundation of inclusion” is laid, Harvard becomes best equipped to “pursue excellence.”
In the creation of this foundation following the report, the University must strive to use definitions of diversity, inclusion, and belonging that consider and prioritize the nuances of the identities of its tens of thousands of members.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In Oct. 2017, prominent film producer Harvey Weinstein was accused of sexual assault against multiple women in the entertainment industry. Over the course of the following days and weeks, many more women accused Weinstein of similar abuse, and he was fired from his company and expelled from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. The women’s accounts of Weinstein’s systematic pattern of predation exposed to many the uncomfortable realities of an industry rife with sexual assault.
The reaction to Weinstein’s behavior was not limited to the entertainment industry. Heartened by the rapid fall of a man as powerful as Weinstein, people in a diverse array of sectors came forward using the hashtag #MeToo. For those who had been blind to the scope and scale of the problem of sexual assault, the movement served as a rude awakening to its prevalence and fed into the discussion about sexual assault in places already notorious for their records on sexual assault: college campuses. As the broader #MeToo movement addressed the misbehavior of elite men, the debate around college campuses has embroiled the schools that train these future elites, Harvard among them.
Harvard is irrevocably tied to the #MeToo movement; the movement’s message is one for which our administration must advocate. The #MeToo movement has finally begun to hold powerful men accountable for their sexual misconduct. Allegations have been brought forth against some of the most influential titans in entertainment, politics, and science. This University has been responsible for training and educating generation after generation of powerful men. Unsurprisingly then, some of the accused have ties to Harvard.
We do not believe that Harvard can be held fully accountable for the actions of its affiliates or the decisions they make after leaving Cambridge. Yet we believe that this institution, which bills itself as cultivating the future leaders of the world, has a moral obligation to build a campus culture that condemns sexual harassment and violence in the strongest possible terms. We are especially reminded of this obligation during commencement, when new Harvard graduates are sent out into the world and the undoubtedly bright futures awaiting them. We hope that their education here will prepare them to be not just great, but good, leaders.
As this semester has repeatedly reminded us, the culture on Harvard’s campus has not always enforced basic lessons on respecting others, particularly women. Sexual misconduct has had a significant, damaging, and tragic influence within Harvard’s own walls. In a profile by the Chronicle of Higher Education, Government professor Jorge I. Dominguez was accused by ten women—both students and faculty members—of sexual harassment. Eight more women would speak out with similar allegations.
Harvard had already sanctioned Dominguez for his alleged sexual misconduct toward one of those women, Terry L. Karl, in 1983. Rather than taking strong disciplinary action against him, Harvard only briefly stripped him of his administrative responsibilities. He was allowed to not only remain at Harvard, but to accrue a long list of honors and interact with countless faculty members and students. While Harvard enabled Dominguez to become a powerful man in his field, Karl departed from the University.
The Dominguez allegations constitute an all-too-common picture of a powerful man using his professional influence to protect and enhance his predatory sexual behavior.  When Karl was just starting out in her career, Dominguez was assigned to mentor her and allegedly hinted that he could influence her future career trajectory while attempting to coerce sexual favors.
While the Dominguez allegations have received the lion’s share of news coverage, they are not unique at Harvard.  Even in the past week, allegations of sexual harassment—defined in part as “lewd or sexually suggestive comments, jokes, innuendoes, or gestures,” in the University’s Title IX policy—have been brought forward against celebrated Economics professor Roland G. Fryer, Jr. One of the at least two formal complaints made to Harvard’s Title IX office alleges that Fryer made “sexually inappropriate comments” to and about employees and “objectified and sexualized” women, including female employees. In a statement provided by his lawyer, Fryer denied any wrongdoing. University-level as well as state-level investigations are ongoing.
Furthermore, in early January, Medical School professor Harvey J. Makadon resigned amidst several accusations of sexual misconduct. In April, the inclusion of more than a dozen Graduate School of Design affiliates on a public spreadsheet, entitled “Shitty Architecture Men,” sparked significant community discourse.
It is highly improbable that sexual misconduct in the University’s academic sphere is limited to these specific incidents. In a recent Crimson survey, nearly 30 percent of faculty members who responded said they knew someone in their department who had experienced sexual harassment or assault. As unfortunate and uncomfortable as this reality may be, Harvard must face it head-on. Harvard can no longer address these incidents retroactively, but must develop a program to prevent these incidents from occurring in the first place.
Cases of sexual harassment and assault in faculty are representative of a larger issue deeply and systemically rooted within this institution. The experiences of professors navigating an all-too-often sexist or even hostile workplace are mirrored by that of students. Undergraduates—particularly women—have been sexually exploited far too often on this campus. The men’s soccer team’s treatment of its female counterparts, likely from at least 2012 to 2016, exemplifies this misconduct. Women’s varsity soccer recruits were explicitly sexualized, assigned a sexual position as well as one on the field in their “scouting report.”
This was not an isolated case. The men’s cross country team had similarly circulated an annual spreadsheet rating the women’s team up until 2016. Other than a cancellation of two out of 17 games for the men’s soccer team and an “athletic probation” that had no defined consequences for the men’s cross country team’s season or competition, no further actions were taken by the college to reprimand the students responsible for these acts.
These patterns find themselves replicated and amplified for undergraduates along Mt. Auburn Street as well. Sexual misconduct is notoriously associated with final clubs. A 2016 Task Force on Sexual Assault Prevention found that 47 percent of female respondents in their senior year who participated in final club life reported “experiencing nonconsensual sexual contact” during their time at the College. The clubs disputed the conclusion, and recent administrative sanctions of final clubs have shifted focus away from sexual assault prevention to issues of inclusivity. As debate over the new social group policy continues, we are concerned that students and administrators alike may have forgotten the serious need to address issues of sexual violence within Harvard’s social scene.
The handling of these issues rings clear with a common note: Perpetrators of sexual misconduct on campus face few consequences for their actions. Across departments, schools, and news headlines, we see a pattern of sexual harassment, assault, and abuse emerging. This pattern is not new, and it has undoubtedly left far too many victims in its wake. It has empowered abusers and silenced survivors. Enough is enough. We expect and demand both that Harvard takes action and communicates this action to the student body.
As we have previously opined, sexual harassment and assault trainings are laughably ineffective and poorly enforced. The College should make Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response trainings mandatory and in-person. Currently, in-person sexual harassment and assault trainings are only required at the start of freshman year. Every other year, students are required to complete an online module. This is grossly insufficient in that the information gained by students tends to fade away quickly. Moreover, online modules makes it difficult to ensure that students are actively engaged with the material.
Harvard should also make OSAPR trainings more focused on real-life sexual assault prevention. The in-person trainings and online modules are not doing enough to facilitate conversations about sexual violence and reminding students of the resources they can use. In 2015, 31.2 percent of Harvard College female seniors who responded to a sexual conduct climate survey reported that they experienced nonconsensual “penetration and sexual touching” in college. This deeply concerning statistic suggests that OSAPR trainings are ineffective in teaching students how to prevent sexual violence.
Harvard’s approach to sexual assault training should be multifaceted. The best way the University can help victims and prevent future assaults is by increasing the amount and quality of resources available to students, hiring personnel with diverse backgrounds, encouraging new strategies for investigations, and streamlining and publicizing the process by which individuals can submit a complaint.
Currently, survivors of sexual assault must navigate an onslaught of different organizations and offices and complaint processes to receive essential services. They must go to a Boston-area hospital for a rape kit. They must go to the Ad Board for a no-contact order. They must go to University Health Services for counseling and STD tests. They must go to their Resident Dean for academic accommodations, and OSAPR and the Title IX Office for guidance. For a recent survivor, bouncing from office to office and continuously recounting their assault may exacerbate their trauma. These resources must be centralized and molded to be as convenient for every student as possible.
Furthermore, OSAPR and other peer counseling groups should clarify the relationship between concerned students and community members and investigators. OSAPR must ensure that students and faculty never feel confused, overlooked, or trivialized in addressing these issues, which affect not only survivors but the entire community. An engaged community is one of the best ways to change the culture of sexual misconduct that is an unfortunate reality of the Harvard academic sphere.
We hope that moving forward, the University’s offices that handle sexual misconduct are able to strike a balance between protecting the privacy of investigations and informing the Harvard community about the pervasiveness of sexual assault and the University’s response to past cases. Transparency is essential to making victims feel comfortable coming forward.
Writing and reading about sexual misconduct can be difficult, especially during commencement. It is not a cheerful topic, and calling attention to these dark moments in Harvard’s history may certainly cast a storm cloud over an often dreamily nostalgic event. Yet we must remember the survivors who carry traumatic memories from Harvard as well as positive ones. We believe that this subject is so important and so antithetical to everything that Harvard ought to stand for, that we cannot leave it untouched.
The #MeToo movement has done an excellent job of empowering survivors to name those who exploit their power in society to sexually abuse, harass, and assault people of all genders. Harvard’s role in this movement should be to do what it knows best—to teach. We call upon Harvard to teach students the importance of affirmative consent, to respect women, and to affirm the rights of survivors. Harvard, too, can and must do better.

“As Luke's roommate, I was constantly inspired by his concern for others and his passion for knowledge. He encouraged me to follow my intellectual curiosities and serve others, and his ethos has continued to shape me to this day. Though many of us at Harvard only had the privilege to know Luke for a year, his impact will last us a lifetime.”
—Jon P. Galla ’18
“Luke was such a kind, thoughtful person. He always had time to help others and I hope that we can honor him by carrying this spirit of caring for others and giving back forward.”
—Priscilla W. Guo ’18
“Luke valued honest self-expression; his essays took up arguments about the nature and demands of human freedom, and of faith, as well as of grace and its mystery; the scope of his inquiries embraced the complex whole of the human condition itself.  Luke understood that ideas were not playthings, but rather connected to the deepest human values and to the communities that were foundational to him: communities of faith, of family, and of friends.”
—Courtney B. Lamberth, Lecturer on Religion
The observation that we only begin to miss people when they are gone is, of course, an obvious one. Still, cutting through all the heartache of Alex’s passing this year, I have only begun to realize the cliché’s profound meaning. I will forever miss Alex’s brilliance, the coffee-fueled conversations at Dunkin Donuts, the times over the summer when we cooked dinner together at his apartment. I will miss taking CS50 with him freshman year, and then this year, after we had both taken some time off from Harvard, how we were set to graduate together. Alex was one of few people whose care he showed towards friends, even strangers, matched his incredible intelligence. Alex was always fond of the classics, so I often remember this line of Catullus when thinking of him: Accipe fraterno multum manantia fletu, atque in perpetuum, frater, ave atque vale – “take this offering, dripping with tears of a brother, and forever farewell.”
—Theodore R. Delwiche ’18
Alex was the hilarious running commentary about the absurdity of life that made me feel better about every situation. He was a voice of patience and reason and wisdom. He was the source of huge quantity of life lessons that stemmed from his own investigations about meaning and purpose. He had this incredible ability to make doing run-of-the-mill things feel extraordinary just because I did them with Alex, because even though we were two kids with next to zero life experience we were going to do something amazing someday. Sometimes it seemed like he was on a different intellectual plane than other people, but he always made me feel like I had a shot of keeping up, and I think he left a more unique imprint on my life, and so many other people’s lives, than just about anybody else ever could.
—Christopher P. Barry, Patel’s high school friend
Alex was an outstanding teacher, computer scientist and human being. My entire group misses his laugh, his ability to cut to the heart of a tricky issue, his willingness to speak the uncomfortable, and his enduring warmth and compassion.
—Margo I. Seltzer ’83, Computer Science Professor
Of any person whom I have ever known, Alex was the one I was most certain would change the world. His infectious curiosity impacted and inspired all who were lucky enough to know him. And his laughter, which would tumble throughout his whole body, still reminds me that wisdom and drive need not come at the cost of happiness. The world is a decidedly less bright, less exciting place without Alex. His death is a scar we now carry that signifies and reminds us of our collective potential to do good, to learn, to teach, and to love. I still can't believe he's gone.
—Sam Mathews, Patel’s high school friend

The GraduatingClass of
2018
by the numbers

Harvard’s Class of 2018 will leave a campus and enter a world each transformed since they arrived in Cambridge four years ago. How Harvard regulates undergraduate social life, when and where students will attend class, and who leads the University—and the country—have all changed since the fall of 2014.
The College’s graduating seniors are largely pessimistic or divided about the developments. They overwhelming agree that the United States is not headed in the right direction, are split about Harvard’s efforts to reshape social life, and largely do not have any opinions of Lawrence S. Bacow, the University’s newly-installed 29th president.
Each year, The Crimson conducts a survey of Harvard’s graduating class of seniors, collecting data about where the class is headed next, how they spent their time at Harvard, and what they think of the College and the nation. This year’s edition garnered 704 responses, almost half of the class, though not every surveyed senior answered each question. The survey, emailed to each senior, was open from May 7 to May 16 and was anonymous. The Crimson did not adjust the data for possible selection bias.
Still, amid tectonic shifts in campus and national life, the Class of 2018 is much like any other set of Harvard graduates. Many of them will graduate with A- averages or better, enter one of three industries—finance, consulting, or technology—and move to New York, California, or Massachusetts. And they’re largely satisfied with the education they received along the Charles River: more than 90 percent of respondents said they would choose Harvard again.
Compare this year’s results to the Class of 2017.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As students packed up to head home for the summer across the past few weeks, University President Drew G. Faust was also busy making preparations to move out of Harvard housing—the presidential residence, called Elmwood.
Faust will officially step down from her post in June, passing the baton to President-elect Lawrence S. Bacow, who will take office on July 1. After more than a decade at Harvard’s helm, Faust will soon depart from both her Massachusetts Hall office and the historic presidential house.
“I’m moving, so I want to get that organized,” Faust said in a May interview. “And Cape Cod is the next step.”
This summer, when Faust trades the hubbub of Cambridge for the quiet of Cape Cod, she said she will begin to think about next steps in her career. Before assuming her current post, Faust—a renowned Civil War historian—taught at the University of Pennsylvania and then served as the founding dean of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study upon first coming to Harvard in 2001.
Faust said she will stay on the Cape through the fall to “reacquaint” herself with the historical literature she might have missed over the last decade as she presided over America’s oldest institution of higher learning.
“I really would like to take the year to think through whether I can be a historian again, what writing project I might want to take on, how I see my voice—what my voice might be useful to think about, talk about in years to come,” Faust said.
Faust called this her “non-plan” for her first year away from perhaps the most demanding job in higher education. She began her tenure at Harvard on the eve of the 2008 financial crisis, which halted the development of a new sciences campus in Allston. Over the course of her presidency, Faust has overseen the progress of the Allston campus, ushered in historic reforms to the Harvard Corporation—the University’s highest governing body—and prioritized fostering collaboration across the University under the “One Harvard” initiative.
Faust has also been a vocal presence in both Cambridge and Washington. After the Nov. 2016 election of Donald Trump, Faust declared she would be “ramping up” her advocacy efforts. She has been an outspoken advocate on issues related to higher education, including immigration legislation, federal research funding, and the “unprecedented” endowment tax passed in December.
Faust said that after she leaves her post, she wants to strike a balance between structuring her time and leaving her schedule open to whatever comes her way.
“I’ve wanted to have enough of a plan so that I don’t feel completely useless, but not so much a plan as to retract my ability to take a deep breath,” she said.
Reflecting on the most meaningful moments of her presidency, Faust said there is much about Harvard she will miss.
Faust said times on campus when she observed Harvard students, faculty, and staff demonstrate their ability to “just be excellent at what they do”—like watching Jeremy Lin ’10 “fly” through the air during men’s basketball games, students perform at Arts First, and faculty report on research—were the moments she loved best.
“Watching the virtuosity of so many members of this community, whether it be in intellectual matters or the arts or athletics or whatever—those have been great moments,” Faust said.
Faust said she especially loves Harvard’s traditions. She mentioned Commencement as an “amazing” time to be on campus, specifically recalling the 2014 ceremony during which Aretha Franklin sang the national anthem.
“Harvard does rituals better than any organization I’ve been associated with,” she said.
Faust also pointed to the University’s 375th anniversary in 2011 as a standout moment. Despite unexpected inclement weather including a “torrential” downpour, Faust said alumni and Harvard affiliates rallied in Tercentenary Theatre to continue the celebration. The event included a performance by famous cellist Yo-Yo Ma ’76.
“It just all went on in the most absurd way, as we got completely soaked. I ruined all my clothes,” she said. “Everyone stayed and stayed and danced—and this was in Tercentenary Theatre—and danced, wrecking the entire Tercentenary Theatre in mud up to their knees.”
As a historian, however, mere reflections will not suffice for Faust. She has also been working to compile a thorough record of her presidency, slated to be stored in the University Archives.
Next to her desk at Elmwood, Faust said she has been diligently collecting papers to send to the presidential archives. She added she is “really glad to know [they] can be preserved” rather than discarded.
“It’s a great relief in some ways because if I couldn’t take all of my papers and take them to the archives, I don’t know what I’d be doing with them,” she said. “I don’t have to worry about whether I throw this out or keep it, it just all goes to the archives.”
The collection will be sealed for many decades before it is available for public view, which Faust said gives her a “safety net” for both official business papers and more personal items.
“I’ll be long gone before anyone can write about them and say the things that I might not want to hear based on what they see,” she said.
Until then, scholars and curious students across the University can only guess at what might be contained in the collections of Harvard’s first female president—and, of course, reflect on their own memories of Faust’s tenure.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Penny S. Pritzker ’81 and Carolyn A. “Biddy” Martin will join the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, Harvard announced Wednesday.
With the addition of Pritzker and Martin, The Corporation  has reached gender parity—its 12 fellows now include six female and six male members.
Pritzker and Martin will fill the two vacancies on the Corporation left by Boston business leader Joseph J. O’Donnell ’67 and Harvard President-elect Lawrence S. Bacow. Bacow, a member of the Corporation since 2011, will transition to the presidential seat on the governing body when University President Drew G. Faust departs at the end of June.
Both Pritzker and Martin were elected to their positions Wednesday by Faust and the Corporation with the consent of the Board of Overseers, the University's second highest governing body. The pair will assume their new roles in July.
Pritzker served a U.S. secretary of commerce under President Barack Obama and is a former Overseer. After graduating from the College, Pritzker earned a joint J.D.-M.B.A. from Stanford in 1985. She currently boasts a net worth of $2.8 billion and a history of donating to Harvard. A common space in the Science Center bears her family’s name, and she has funded scholarships, research centers, and programs at the School of Public Health and Graduate School of Education.
Martin is the president of Amherst College and the former chancellor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. She will become one of five fellows of the Corporation who are not College alumni. A distinguished scholar of German studies and women’s studies, Martin also served as the provost of Cornell University for eight years until 2008. During her time as Cornell provost, Martin oversaw the construction of $150 million life sciences complex. Harvard is currently undertaking a similar venture with the construction of a sciences campus in neighboring Allston.
William F. Lee ’72, the senior fellow of the Corporation, wrote in a statement he thinks Martin and Pritzker will be “outstanding” new additions to the Corporation.
“We’re very fortunate to have two such capable, knowledgeable, and accomplished individuals ready to join the Corporation come July,” Lee wrote.
Though the governing body will soon achieve gender parity, it will still be predominantly white; Lee and Corporation members Kenneth I. Chenault and Theodore V. Wells Jr. are the only non-white members of the group.
Pritzker wrote in a statement that returning to Harvard as a Corporation fellow will be “an incredible honor and privilege.”
“I am deeply grateful to this university community for its transformative impact on my life and career, helping to shape not only my learning but also my values and commitment to others,” she wrote. “My hope is that I will serve as a worthy and wise advisor to President Bacow, the leadership team, and all the University’s various constituents in order to maintain the high level of excellence of this dynamic institution.”
Martin wrote she felt “honored to be asked to serve” as a Corporation member.
“The values that guide Harvard and the example it sets matter, not only to Harvard and its future, but also to the future of American higher education more broadly,” Martin wrote. “I look forward to working with President Bacow and the members of the Corporation to help steward this remarkable institution and promote its mission in the world.”
The Corporation exercises authority over the University’s fiduciary affairs, overseeing its financial, academic, and physical resources. The Corporation also holds the power to select and remove Harvard presidents, and it recently used this power to appoint the University’s 29th president. The body has also made historic decisions regarding student social life including finalizing the College’s May 2016 sanctions against single-gender social organizations.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When President-elect Lawrence S. Bacow assumes the helm of the University in July, he will also take responsibility, in part, for Harvard’s $37.1 billion endowment. University administrators say Bacow’s experience as a member of the Harvard Corporation—the University’s highest governing body—will help him transition well into his new role.
The performance of Harvard’s endowment has faced close scrutiny in recent years. In 2016, the University lost nearly $2 billion in endowment value. The following year, the endowment recorded an 8.1 percent return on its investments, an Ivy-League low which Harvard Management Company CEO N.P. “Narv” Narvekar described as “a symptom of deep structural problems at HMC.”
Bacow’s presidency will not mark the first time he has navigated Harvard’s finances. Thomas J. Hollister, chief financial officer of the University, said the president-elect has also been “intimately involved” in the financial affairs of the University as a Corporation member.
“Larry is uniquely qualified in many regards,” Hollister said in an interview. “In the case of finance in particular, he chaired the facilities committee here at Harvard for the board, and he most recently in the last three or four years has chaired the finance committee.”
Jennifer Dilts, assistant vice president of finance, said Bacow has always been “incredibly generous in his feedback” as a member of the finance committee.
“As part of his role on the finance committee, he’s been really engaged and thoughtful,” Dilts said. “He’s a helpful thought partner for us to think about both big picture ideas of finance but even more into the details of the kinds of analysis and scenarios we might present.”
The endowment’s underperformance has drawn some calls for change. Days after the presidential search committee publicly announced they had selected Bacow as Harvard’s 29th president, alumni from the Class of 1969 wrote to Bacow to suggest the University invest in lower-cost index funds tracking the S&P 500.
Hollister said, however, that Bacow would likely “spend a lot of time listening and learning” before considering new initiatives.
“Someone used the analogy of Drew ‘passing the baton.’” Hollister said. “Drew’s been running at full speed, and here comes Larry at full speed, and she’s going to hand the baton. I think that’s a nice way to think of it.”
During the February press conference announcing his selection as president, Bacow said he will look to cut down the University’s administrative costs. “We need to do a better job of controlling our costs, we need to do a better job of operating more efficiently,” he said at the time.
While the exact shape these cuts may take remains unclear, Hollister said he is sure about one aspect of Bacow’s financial vision.
“Whenever we have conversations about finances, Larry always ties it right back to the mission,” Hollister said. “He wants to make sure that anything, whenever we’re talking about the money, where it’s going and where it’s not going, he wants to make sure it’s being spent in a way that is directed at teaching and research.”

Harvard’s largest labor union has come to the bargaining table to negotiate a new contract with the University, the union and administrators announced in a joint statement to union members last week.
The union—called the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers—represents around 5,100 Harvard employees, primarily those who work in libraries, labs, and faculty offices. The contract, which must be finalized by Sept. 30—the date the existing contract expires—will be binding for the next three years.
HUCTW President Carrie Barbash said the union has been in informal talks with the University since December and began holding issue-based discussions with Harvard earlier in the spring.
In the weekly meetings, University Director of Labor and Employee Relations Paul R. Curran, other members of the Office of Labor and Employee Relations, and several “high-level managers” negotiated with union officers and elected representatives, Barbash said. As negotiations progress, the union anticipates bringing in professional mediators.
“Often, things get difficult, and we try to bring them in before so that they're already filled in and so that they can also help shape the early discussions in the most productive way,” Barbash said.
“Hopefully, things never get that way,” she added.
Barbash said that, in addition to traditional negotiations over salary increases, the union plans to prioritize introducing clauses meant to limit the University’s use of contingent workers in place of unionized employees.
“Obviously the world is changing, work is changing,” Barbash said. “I think we're just looking at, how is the University using all these different types of staff or different types of workers, how common is their usage across the University, and is that a good thing or something, maybe, that we should look at it together?”
In a statement, Curran wrote the initial negotiations have been “very productive” and have “laid a solid foundation for successful negotiations.”
“We look forward to engaging with the HUCTW bargaining team in the negotiation process,” Curran wrote. “Our team is pleased to be a part of the longstanding positive relationship between HUCTW and Harvard University.”
“I am very hopeful that we can reach a successor agreement that adequately addresses the interests of both parties and will allow us to continue on with the important mission of the University,” he added.
Barbash agreed, saying the negotiations “have been progressing smoothly so far.”
“We try to make proposals that would enable both parties to save money,” Barbash said. “As much as it is possible, we come up with win-win proposals.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Enrollment for a Medical School professor’s study was “paused” earlier this month because the project is facing two federal investigations for its relationship with alcohol industry groups.
The study is sponsored by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, part of the National Institutes of Health. The study’s principal investigator, Kenneth J. Mukamal, holds appointments at Beth Israel and Harvard Medical School, where he is an associate professor of medicine. He is also a visiting scientist at the School of Public Health.
The study originally aimed to enroll 7,800 participants, who would be randomly assigned to either have one drink a day or not drink at all for the next six years to study the effects of moderate drinking, according to the study’s website. It sought participants over the age of 50 without a family history of breast cancer.
Mukamal and his colleagues met with alcohol executives multiple times in 2013 and 2014. At one meeting, they said the study presented a “unique opportunity to show that moderate alcohol consumption is safe,” the New York Times reported in March.
The study’s funding sources include five large liquor companies, which channeled funding through the nongovernmental organization, Foundation for the NIH, according to the Times.
The NIH has since launched two reviews of the study—one by its Office of Management Assessment and the other by its Advisory Committee to the Director—and has instructed Beth Israel to “pause all study activities until the reviews are completed,” according to an NIH statement.
Mukamal declined an interview through Jennifer Kritz, a Beth Israel spokesperson, but Kritz provided a statement from the hospital about the study.
“BIDMC has strong policies in place to ensure the scientific and ethical integrity of any research study involving our investigators,” the statement read, adding that multiple boards reviewed the study before it began. “[W]e have not found any reason to believe that it does not adhere to our institutional requirements.”
Eric G. Campbell, a professor of medicine at the University of Colorado who directs the university’s center for bioethics and humanities and recently left Harvard Medical School, said much medical research would not be able to take place without industry support, but identified several “problematic” aspects of the study’s funding and design.
“The solicitation of funding from the alcohol industry appears to have preceded the review of the studies. In other words, they got the money and then went out and had people apply for those studies,” he said.
Campbell added that Mukamal’s statements in advance of the study may have predicted its results in a way that violates fundamental scientific norms.
Results from the NIH’s investigation are expected next month.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ohio Governor John Kasich urged graduating students at the Kennedy School’s Class Day celebration Wednesday to engage in self-reflection and live out values of “love” and “respect.”
Amid rumors that Kasich may challenge President Donald Trump for the presidency in 2020, Kasich’s speech notably steered clear of politics or public policy. Instead, it focused on values he said he has derived from religious faith.
“I think what is so interesting is that Christians and Jews and Muslims all basically have the same view of human life: that human life is special, the human life is above all other life, and that the creator created this human life and made it above all else,” Kasich told students assembled at John F. Kennedy Park. “It is our duty to reflect on our creator and to recognize that every human being is made in the images of our creator.”
“Whether you buy it or not, if we are all made in the image of God, if we are all made in the image of our creator, we have no right to dismiss or alienate any other human being,” Kasich continued. “It means we must show respect, something that I think we all yearn for today.”
Kasich has served as governor of Ohio since his election in 2010 and unsuccessfully sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. He was also a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from 1983 to 2001 and chair of the House Budget Committee for a portion of that period.
The choice of Kasich as a speaker brought criticism from international students at the Kennedy School who said that as an American politician, he did not reflect their global identities. In response, the Kennedy School added an event featuring the Mongolian president Tuesday to the school’s Commencement week schedule.
Kasich announced after dropping out of the Republican primary race in 2016 that he would not vote for Trump. He has since sought to distance himself from the president; he has openly opposed Trump’s positions on trade and DACA, the Obama-era program that allows undocumented youth to legally live and work in the United States.
At the Kennedy School ceremony, Kasich urged graduates “to portray the character of [the] creator.”
“Whether it is Old or New Testament, if you search that book, it is all about love,” Kasich said.  “It is about love. It is about compassion. It is about humility, it is about forgiveness, it is about responsibility. It is about justice. It is about respect for others. It is about personal responsibility but fundamentally, it is about living a life a little bigger than ourselves.”
“It really is about treating others and loving others, which means doing good for others, even when you have no self interests,” he added.
Kasich referenced various moments in which he said he believed these “instinctive virtues” were portrayed, including the actions of those in recent mass shootings in Las Vegas and Parkland, Fla., by bystanders who attempted to protect others who were gunned down.
“My hope is there for humanity because I saw those virtues are written on our hearts. If we would just slow down, and reflect, we will get it right,” he said.
Kasich also expressed his “hope” in graduates to carry out change “from the bottom up.”
“My hope is really in the millennials, all of you today who are going to graduate from a prestigious university where you get automatic power,” he said. “I believe in you and I want you to believe in yourselves, that you can change the way that the world turns on its axis. You can, you will, you must. We are counting on you.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s newly formed graduate student union selected the 13 members of its bargaining committee in an election held May 9 and 10—though  only 10 percent of eligible voters cast ballots, prompting some to criticize what they called the union's failure to engage students.
The bargaining committee is tasked with collecting feedback from members of the bargaining unit, setting the agenda for negotiations, and going to the bargaining table on behalf of Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers. The groupwill likely spend the next several months distributing and collecting bargaining surveys in order to gauge union members’ contract priorities.
After more than half of eligible students have completed the survey, the committee can begin drawing up a bargaining agenda which they will present to University administrators.
HGSU-UAW represents around 5,000 eligible graduate and undergraduate teaching and research assistants across Harvard’s schools. Five hundred thirteen members of the bargaining unit voted in the election, according to meeting notes from an HGSU-UAW executive committee meeting May 14 obtained by The Crimson.
Ph.D. student Kayla Davis, who voted against unionizing with HGSU-UAW in April’s election, wrote in an email that she hopes bargaining committee members will make an effort to “hear more voices” before they head to the bargaining table. Davis particularly suggested the committee meet with graduate students and make executive committee meetings open to all members.
“I’m concerned that only 10% of the student population considered in the bargaining unit voted for the bargaining committee and that these numbers make me think that the union is not doing a good job in being transparent about their actions or getting new students involved in their decision making,” Davis wrote.
“If the union wants to represent all student workers then they need to work to hear all student voices and include them in the entire decision making process,” she added.
Ph.D. student Noah Bloch wrote in an email that “the low turnout is a plain and simple embarrassment for the union.”
Union organizers and bargaining committee members Justin Bloesch, an Economics Ph.D. student, and Philosophy Ph.D. student Ege Yumusak ’16 wrote in an email that organizers are committed to “hosting open meetings across campus in Longwood and Cambridge.”
“A diverse group of students ran for the bargaining committee, including previously uninvolved students and even students who did not support unionization, and students from across campus cast their votes and signed up as members at the bargaining committee election,” Yumusak and Bloesch wrote. “We look forward to continuing to build our democracy and encourage everyone to get involved in this exciting process to build our union and win our first contract.”
In a previous email, Yumusak and Bloesch wrote that many of the students elected have “substantial experience as advocates on issues important to students.” Many of the committee’s members have previously organized with HGSU-UAW and take part in executive committee meetings.
“We're excited to have a bargaining committee whose members are diverse in their experience and their identities, and come from a broad range of work environments,” Bloesch and Yumusak wrote. “We're excited to take that energy towards reaching to the broader campus through the bargaining survey.”
The full list of bargaining committee members is as follows:
Jennifer K. Austiff
Justin Bloesch
Cherrie N. Bucknor
PaHua Cha
Benjamin Z. A. Green
Ashley B. Gripper
Madeleine F. Jennewein
Fan-Yun Lan
Evan C. MacKay ’19

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, an award-winning novelist and one of Time Magazine’s 100 most influential people of 2015, called on graduating seniors to pursue the truth and use the power of their Harvard degrees to change the world at the College’s Class Day exercises Wednesday.
Adichie, who served as a fellow at Harvard’s Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study in 2011, interspersed her message about the importance of honesty with jokes about whether Harvard was better than Yale—where she attended graduate school—as well as what she called the “grand snobbery sweepstakes” of elite American institutions of higher education.
“If I were asked the title of my address to you today, I would say ‘above all else, do not lie.’ Or, ‘don’t lie too often.’ Which is really to say, tell the truth. But lying—the word, the idea, the act—has such political potency in American today that it somehow feels more apt,” she said.
Adichie’s statements come in light of increasing skepticism about the value of the truth in the current political climate. She also argued for the importance of truth and balanced coverage in journalism.
Adichie opened her remarks with an anecdote about a presenter who once, after devotedly practicing the proper pronunciation of Adichie’s name, accidentally introduced her as “chimichanga.” She said the moment taught her the importance of understanding the origin of ideas and actions.
“The point of this story is not to say that you can call me ‘chimichanga’—don’t even think about it—the point is that intent matters, that context matters,” she said. “We now live in a culture of calling out, a culture of outrage. And you should call people out, you should be outraged. But always remember context and never disregard intent.”
She also joked about the College’s motto—often cited by Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, who spoke before her—which calls on students to be “citizens and citizen leaders.” Adichie likened what she called the phrase’s vagueness to some Harvard students’ reluctance to admit they are students and graduates of the school.
“I don’t even know what ‘citizen leader’ means,” Adichie said. “It sort of sounds like a Harvard graduate saying, ‘I went to college in Boston,’ which, by the way, has to be the most immodest form of modesty. Please, Class of 2018, when you’re asked where you went to college, just say Harvard.”
Offering words of wisdom to graduating seniors who may not yet know what they want to do, Adichie reflected on her journey to literary acclaim. She quoted well-known television producer Shonda Rhimes regarding the importance of continuing to try until one finds an occupation at once enjoyable and successful.
She also admitted she often procrastinates while working on novels, at times resorting to online shopping to avoid work. She said she believes procrastination is rooted in fear and said she understood how students who might feel similarly.
“I’m actually thinking of starting a society of esteemed procrastinators, and I suspect that many of you would probably sign up,” she said. “Procrastinating is a form of fear and it is difficult to acknowledge fear, but the truth is that you cannot create anything of value without both self-doubt and self-belief. Without self-doubt, you become complacent. Without self-belief, you cannot succeed. You need both. And there is also the fear of measuring up, of keeping up, which for you might be heightened by the heavy weight of all those Harvard expectations.”
She ended by repeating a saying in Igbo—a language spoken in her native country of Nigeria—about valuing one’s own place in the world and the pace at which one discovers their self-worth. The crowd, which had laughed along and cheered throughout, met her parting words with a standing ovation.
Student speakers took the stage before Adichie to offer both serious and humorous reflections on their time at Harvard. Jin K. Park ’18, who spoke as the Harvard Orator, discussed his path to Harvard as an undocumented immigrant. Roughly 65 undocumented students attended Harvard this past academic year.
Ivy Orator Carolina S. Brettler ’18 joked about “RJCTN 10a: ‘An Introduction to Reality,’” a class title she fictitiously invented to explain the resilience required to make it through college and face the world after leaving Harvard’s gates.
First and Second Class Marshals Berkeley E. Brown ’18 and Wyatt M. Robertson ’18 opened and closed the celebration with speeches asserting their gratitude for the classmates, faculty, family, and friends who helped them reach graduation. Incoming Harvard Alumni Association President Margaret M. Wang ’09 spoke about her time at the College and welcomed the Class of 2018 into the organization.
Blockmates and friends of Luke Z. Tang ’18 and Alexander H. Patel ’17-’18 read poetry and speeches in commemoration of the two men, who passed away in the fall of 2015 and this past fall, respectively.
The event concluded with a group of student vocalists who sang an ode for the Class of 2018 to the tune of the University’s alma mater “Fair Harvard.”
Long-serving member of Congress and civil rights activist John R. Lewis will speak Thursday afternoon at the University's 367th Commencement ceremony.

U.S. Senator Jeffry L. Flake warned soon-to-be Harvard Law School graduates that “America without the rule of law is no longer America” at the school’s Class Day ceremony Wednesday.
Flake took the stage at Harvard amid speculation that he is mulling a 2020 presidential run. At an event earlier this year in New Hampshire—a key early stop for presidential hopefuls—Flake did not rule out running against President Donald Trump, whom he has repeatedly and publicly challenged.
His speech Wednesday was a blistering attack on the leadership of Trump and his current colleagues in Congress, as he delivered what he called “a cautionary tale about the rule of law and its fragility.”
“Our presidency has been debased by a figure who seemingly has a bottomless appetite for destruction and division and only a passing familiarity with how the Constitution works,” Flake said.
Flake urged the Law School Class of 2018 to choose their principles over their careers, arguing that it “will be better” for themselves and those around them.
“There are times when circumstances may call on you to risk your career in favor of your principles,” Flake said. “But you and your country will be better for it.”
“You can go elsewhere for a job, but you cannot go elsewhere for a soul,” he added.
Some Law students have criticized the selection of Flake as the Class Day speaker. Emil N. Nachman, a third-year J.D. student, wrote an op-ed in the Harvard Law Record Monday expressing his disappointment with Flake’s selection as the guest speaker and pointing to the Arizona senator’s voting record.
“At this level—at the level of action—Senator Flake has done painfully little,” Nachman wrote. “Senator Flake’s failures go beyond complicity; he himself has played an active role in the upswell of anti-democratic politics that he criticizes so staunchly in the president.”
Flake acknowledged Wednesday that his views as a “conservative Republican” may diverge from those of many Harvard Law students, though he said solving societal problems “must involve both sides.”
Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 also addressed graduating students and their families at the ceremony held on a sunny afternoon in front of Langdell Library.
In his first Class Day address as dean, Manning applauded members of the Class of 2018’s pro bono service and work over their three years at the school. This class graduates at the end of Law School’s year-long bicentennial celebration.
“You’re the first class of our third century,” Manning told students. “Your drive and your creativity have made this law school buzz with energy. And you have given of yourself through exceptional service to those who need your representation.”
At a time when the Law School’s commitment to public service is being questioned, Manning added that the J.D. Class of 2018 performed a record 376,532 hours of pro bono service since arriving at the school, with an average of 637 hours per student.
Other speakers included Law Professor Carol S. Steiker ’82 , who received a teaching award, Edgar K. Filho, an administrative and operations supervisor in the student affairs office, and  Law School Association President Peter C. Krause, and Dean of Students Marcia L. Sells, who presented a collection of student awards.

Amorino, a high-end gelato chain, will open in Harvard Square just in time for the summer.
Léa Sasportes, the executive developer for Amorino in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, said the store is slated to open in the next month or so.
“We should be opening in early June—some time between June 1 and June 10,” Sasportes said. “On the first day, we’re probably going to do free ice cream for an hour or so.”
The Harvard Square location will be the second Amorino in the Boston area.The branch has operated a store on Newbury Street since 2015.
Sasportes said she has sought to open a Harvard Square location since before the Newbury Street location opened its doors. She noted the chain is “very popular among students and tourists,” arguing that Harvard Square is therefore the “best location for customers hoping to get the Amorino experience.”
She said students particularly enjoy the way Amorino shapes its gelato into flowers.
“For students, I think it’s a fun experience because we do the flower shape on the cone. And for every Christmas and Easter, we always add those little signature cones that come with a macaron,” Sasportes said.
“People love taking pictures and sharing them on social media,” she added.
Founded in 2002 in France, Amorino now boasts “boutiques” all across the world, including sites in France, the United Arab Emirates, and South Korea.
Though Amorino will be the only gelato shop in the Square, it joins popular ice cream locations dotted throughout the Square like J.P. Licks and Lizzie’s.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard administrators sent a formerly all-female campus singing group an email demanding the choir update its bylaws to “align with the mission of the College” a few months before the group chose to go coed.
The formerly all-female Radcliffe Choral Society opened its membership to students of all genders in late April 2018.
The Office of Student Involvement, an office within the College’s Office of Student Life, sent an email to RCS members in August 2017 informing the group that its bylaws—which at the time stated only women could join the choir—fell “in violation” of the College’s non-discrimination policies. College administrators also threatened RCS would become “inactive” if it failed to update its guidelines.
“The articles and bylaws of your governing documents should outline basic organizational information, be aligned with the mission of the College, including our commitment to non-discrimination, and have specific, required language,” reads a copy of the email sent to RCS August 25. “We’ve identified that your organization’s governing documents are in violation of these requirements and must be revised and updated as part of your Annual Registration process.”
“Failure to update your student organization’s bylaws to be in compliance with the requirements listed below by the end of Annual Registration (September 19th), will result in your organization being inactive for one semester,” the email continues.
The email notes that, if RCS became inactive, the group would lose privileges granted to “an active organization” including the ability to apply for grants and the ability to host and publicize events.
The organization’s membership began discussing going gender-neutral long before the September email, according to RCS president Katherine M. Vincent ’19. The choir formally updated its bylines to allow members of all genders April 23; shortly afterward, the historically all-male Glee Club also went coed. The Glee Club adjusted its bylaws to allow members of every gender on April 30.
The move by the two singing groups to go coed comes as the College works to enforce and implement its controversial social group policy, first debuted May 2016. The 2016 policy—which took effect with the Class of 2021—bars members of unrecognized single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from campus leadership positions, the captaincies of varsity athletic teams, and from receiving College endorsement for various prestigious fellowships.
Administrators recently announced unrecognized single-gender social groups will be required to disclose gender breakdowns in order to avoid the sanctions. Social groups will also have to submit “governing documents” to the College in order to gain recognition and freedom from the penalties, according to a plan Harvard debuted May 2018.
RCS and Glee Club, though single-gender, are recognized student groups and therefore not subject to the College’s social group penalties.
The College’s policy for recognized student groups states that recognized “independent student organizations” must “file a current constitution and bylaws with the OSL making clear that the ISO does not discriminate on the basis of race, creed, color, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, or physical disability,” according to the College’s student handbook.
RCS performs treble music and Glee Club sings tenor-bass music; both groups are more than 100 years old. RCS was founded in 1899 and Glee Club was founded in 1858—until last month, both groups had remained single-gender throughout their histories.
A Harvard spokesperson did not immediately respond Wednesday evening to a question asking why the College instructed RCS to go coed.
In a joint statement, representatives from the executive committees of Glee Club, RCS, and Harvard-Radcliffe Collegium Musicum—a historically gender-neutral choir that also recently chose to update its bylaws to specifically allow members of all genders—wrote they “reject any claim that the substance of our community and artistic work relies on the gender of our members.”
Choir leadership also wrote in the statement that internal factors formed the “primary driver” behind the decision to update the guidelines, not communications from College administrators.
“We would like to affirm that external factors were not the primary driver in the decision to change our bylaws. This decision was a result of a multitude of discussions over a lengthy period of time within the chorus membership and leadership,” the statement reads.
Glee Club manager Samuel C. Hsiang ’20 said the three groups have held joint auditions for several years. On audition forms, students are asked to indicate their voice part—soprano, alto, tenor, or bass—but not their gender.
“That's been practice for much longer than that. It's just solidifying it into the language at this point,” Hsiang said.
Collegium manager Alan Wong ’19 wrote in an emailed statement that the change to Collegium’s bylaws is meant to formally reflect the group’s historically mixed-gender membership.
“Collegium has never considered gender when deciding the membership of our choir, and as with the other choirs, we recently voted to instate gender-neutral language within our bylaws to reflect this,” he wrote. “We have always been, and will continue to be, a welcoming space for singers of all gender identities.”
Wong wrote in an email that the three groups plan to continue singing similar repertoires in the future.
“It is important to note that the artistic identity of each of these choirs is distinct: while Collegium focuses on performing choral-orchestral works for SATB, RCS focuses on soprano-alto works and HGC on tenor-bass works,” Wong wrote. “This will remain unchanged despite the recent changes to our groups’ bylaws to accept singers of any gender identity.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Undergraduates and graduate students have launched a new anti-sexual harassment campaign—dubbed “Times Up Harvard”—calling on the University to better respond to instances of sexual misconduct.
Organizers timed the campaign to coincide with Commencement, a time of year they say brings together people across Harvard and provides a platform for demanding change.
“Commencement is the time when the barrier between Harvard and the greater world kind of falls away for graduates, so it's a good time for something like this, which is tied in with our responsibilities beyond just this institution,” said Kelly T. “Kay” Xia ’19, an organizer affiliated with the anti-sexual assault advocacy group Our Harvard Can Do Better.
Student organizations including Our Harvard Can Do Better, the Kennedy School’s Gender Policy Union, and the newly-formed Harvard Graduate Student Union “Times Up” committee are all helping organize the effort.
Organizers handed out stickers for graduates to wear at Commencement ceremonies Thursday across Harvard’s campus. The students also sent a letter to University President Drew G. Faust and incoming president, Lawrence S. Bacow, outlining a number of demands.
The campaign and letter come in the wake of the #MeToo movement, a social media campaign that encourages women to come forward with stories of workplace sexual harassment. Harvard has seen its own #MeToo scandal in the form of allegations of decades of sexual harassment perpetrated by Government professor Jorge I. Dominguez. The students’ May letter specifically references the Dominguez case, calling it “deeply shocking” but adding “this was not an isolated incident.”
The letter explicitly urges Faust and Bacow to “publicly commit to increasing Harvard’s efforts to protect its students and workers against sexual violence and harassment, by going above and beyond compliance with the law.”
“Harvard must create an environment where every student and worker feels comfortable coming forward and where the problem of sexual violence is no longer a substantial impediment to the well-being of our community,” the letter reads. “We hope to work with you to achieve our shared goal of improving Harvard’s response to sexual misconduct.”
The letter—which gives administrators a week to respond to students' concerns and establish a time to meet with organizers—also laid out three recommendations including a suggestion that Harvard commit to conducting “regular campus climate surveys” and practice greater transparency when processing of Title IX complaints. The letter also requested Bacow meet with Harvard affiliates who have experienced sexual harassment.
The last University-wide climate survey on sexual misconduct was conducted in 2015 by the American Association of Universities through the research firm Westat. That survey revealed 31 percent of senior undergraduate women at the time had experienced some form of sexual assault while at Harvard. The University has not conducted a climate survey since.
The University-wide Title IX Office does, however, release annual reports that provide anonymized data on Title IX complaints and investigations.
The students’ letter also called for additional mandatory sexual assault prevention and response training. University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 and Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp announced earlier this month that Harvard will now require all faculty and staff members to complete an online training on the University’s sexual and gender-based harassment policies starting fall 2018.
University spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga wrote in an email Wednesday that the “safety” and “well-being” of the University remains administrators’ “top priority.” She also noted the University’s Office of Dispute Resolution and Title IX Office are committed to equal access for University programs.
“The University, ODR, and the Title IX Office have repeatedly reiterated their unwavering commitment to ensuring equal access to University programs and activities as well as our commitment to promoting diversity and inclusion based on sex, including sexual orientation and gender identity,” deLuzuriaga wrote.
Amelia Y. Goldberg ’19, a member of Our Harvard Can Do Better, said the action was coordinated by “a coalition of survivors and allies” from across the University. She referenced various instances she said made clear “the significant and negative effects” of sexual assault on Harvard’s students and workers—specifically, the Dominguez allegations and an anonymous spreadsheet, circulated online in recent months, that contained allegations accusing multiple affiliates of the Graduate School of Design of acts of sexual harassment.
“A real sense around a lot of students is that this is an ongoing problem and something that we need be taking new and innovative action against,” Goldberg said. “And so I think, in that climate, and in order to recognize the ongoing problems that we are facing and to stand in solidarity with survivors, we are asking people who are going to be graduating and everyone present at commencement to show their solidarity.”
Goldberg also referenced the U.S. Department of Education's 2011 decision to review a series of Title IX guidelines, a move that spurred Harvard and universities across the country to overhaul their responses to sexual assault on campus.
Xia, who said she has experienced sexual assault, said a number of the campaign’s organizers were in part motivated by personal experiences of sexual misconduct and assault.
“A lot of the organizing members for this action are survivors of sexual violence, and that our frustrations with the school's systemic response that was central to organizing this action, which feels personally important to us,” Xia said.
The Crimson reported Monday—several days after organizers sent their letter to Faust and Bacow—that Economics professor Roland G. Fryer Jr. is facing allegations of verbal sexual harassment and is the subject of Harvard and state investigations. Fryer has been barred since March from setting foot in the research lab he heads.
Correction: May 26, 2018
A previous version of this story incorrectly stated the U.S. Department of Education chose to review a series of Title IX guidelines in 2017. In fact, the department chose to review the guidelines in 2011.

In terms of individual performances, Harvard men’s lacrosse’s encounter with Boston University had it all. A career high in goals for the Crimson’s leading goal scorer, sophomore Kyle Anderson. A career high in points for its leading points getter, senior Morgan Cheek. And not to mention, a career high in faceoff wins for its rookie faceoff specialist, Steven Cuccurullo.
Three career games from three of the team’s most important players would bode well for any squad, but as it turned out, the Crimson would need every bit of individual brilliance from Anderson, Cheek, and Cuccurullo, and then some, on that chilly March night at Harvard Stadium.
With just seven minutes remaining in the game, the Crimson found itself trailing 18-12 to its crosstown rivals. Terriers attackman James Burr had just rifled two shots past Harvard senior goalie Robert Shaw in the span of 17 seconds, appearing to snuff out any thoughts of a comeback by the home side. Those two goals were enough for Burr—BU’s leading goal-scorer on the season—to match his career best as well.
On the ensuing faceoff, however, the Crimson came up with the exact response it needed. Cuccurullo won possession and quickly dumped the ball off to Cheek, who fired the ball past Terriers sophomore goalie Joe McSorley at the 6:59 mark. Just seven seconds had elapsed since Burr’s goal, and after another faceoff win by Cuccurullo, the comeback was suddenly on again.
“We weren’t going to let up, and we knew the shots would go our way at some point,” Cheek said. “One, two quick scores and it’s game on.”
Game on, indeed, as Harvard pulled closer at 18-14 on the very next possession. Anderson provided the finish while Cheek supplied the assist, and at the 5:38 mark of the fourth, the Crimson was once again within striking distance.
However, BU won the next faceoff and with it a chance to milk the clock. Milk it they did, but when the time came to put the game away, a shot from senior attackman Ryan Hilburn clanged off the post and Harvard senior midfielder Carney Mahon picked up the ground ball.
After a penalty by the visitors, the Anderson-Cheek combination struck again at the 3:13 mark. Anderson had already set a new career high in goals by this point with five, but he was not finished. He connected twice more in the subsequent two minutes to bring the Crimson within one score at 18-17, capping off a personal 4-0 run with a well-placed bouncing shot from a tight angle.
“Those are the shots that go in for you during practice, but usually not in the games. Thankfully, those were working for me tonight,” Anderson said after the match.
Then, riding all of the momentum, Harvard scored the goal which, by that point, seemed inevitable. Co-captain midfielder Joe Lang finished off clever team play with 0:48 left on the clock, and just over six minutes after Burr had fired the Terriers ahead by six, the contest was back at square one.

Cheek went on to put the finishing touches on the historic win in overtime, scoring the game winner one minute into the extra frame with a running, over the shoulder shot. As soon as he saw the ball ripple the back of the net to secure the 19-18 victory, Cheek threw his stick up into the air in celebration while teammates streamed towards him from across the field and off of the bench.
“Our guys, to be able to pull off that kind of win just goes to show the character we have on the team and the never-say-quit attitude,” said Crimson coach Chris Wojcik ’96. “A midweek night game, and everything seemed to be going right for BU. We could have given up on the game, but we didn’t.”
At the end of the day, players on both sides had put too much into the game not to fight and claw until the very end. In addition to Anderson, Cheek, Cuccurullo, and Burr, three other Terriers players set or matched career highs in at least one offensive category, and Lang set a new career high with nine points as well.
As could be expected in such a tight game, the two sides were nearly evenly matched in faceoff wins and ground balls. Both teams put together multiple runs over the course of the contest that alone would have been enough to decide the outcome of most games but with the two offenses performing at such high levels, it came down to which team could make the final run.
“There wasn’t a doubt in our minds we had enough offensively to outscore them,” Anderson said. “And thanks to our seniors who kept us even through the game and especially the fourth quarter, we were able to stay cool and see the comeback through till the end.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When essentially everyone on the team agrees that a game was one of the wildest, if not the wildest, games they’ve ever been a part of, you can be sure that the game was absolutely bananas.
The Harvard baseball team closed out its 2018 season on May 14 with a win over Dartmouth by a final scoreline of 18-17. The squad delivered five home runs en route to an eight-run comeback, capped by senior second baseman Matt Rothenberg’s second homer of the afternoon, a two-run shot in the eighth.
Rothenberg, having just finished the last game of his career in a Crimson jersey, described the comeback perfectly.
“There’s no script for it,” Rothenberg said. “Every time you step up to bat, you do it with pride, so it was just a lot of good at-bats in a row and a couple big home runs, and we’d clawed our way back. But there’s no script for it.”
The results certainly were wild.
“The Dartmouth game was definitely one of the crazier games I’ve ever been a part of,” said junior first baseman Pat McColl. “[The hits] just kept coming on that day…. We were getting pretty excited in the dugout, going crazy.”
The two offenses seemingly scored at will on a beautiful Sunday afternoon at O’Donnell Field in Cambridge.
Dartmouth put up three runs in the first, three in the third, a tally in the fourth, four in the fifth, and six in the sixth, scoring 10 unanswered runs at one point to take a 17-9 lead in the top of the sixth inning.

Harvard answered with four in the second, two in the third, three in the fourth, and seven in the bottom of the sixth to bring it back to a 17-16 deficit.
That sequence would’ve been enough for an amazing game in itself. A 17-16 score in a baseball game can only mean that both teams very badly wanted to win on the last day of the regular season.
But with sophomore pitcher/third baseman Hunter Bigge at first with no outs in the bottom half of the eighth, Rothenberg stepped to the plate and bombed his second homer of the day to left field to leapfrog the Crimson into the decisive lead.
“I’d probably put that as our best comeback of the year, definitely,” said junior center fielder Ben Skinner. “It was a wild game. Even though it was an eight-run deficit, just based on how the game had shaped up so far, we still thought we had a chance. It was awesome to come right back in the same inning where they put up six, to put up seven. It was a fun win for us, definitely.”
On a day when scoreless innings were a prized rarity, the defense emerged an unlikely hero for Harvard when it was still trailing, 17-16.
Bigge, who played the hot corner for the first five frames, took the mound for head coach Bill Decker in the sixth and put up a gutsy performance. The sophomore stopped the bleeding in the sixth and then went on to put up three straight goose eggs, freezing Dartmouth at 17 runs.
“My first thought out there was, ‘Oh, these guys are slamming the ball, I need to do a little bit more than I usually do on the mound,’” said Bigge, out of breath but clearly happy after the game. “I tried to tell myself to do what I do best and just focus on my game, and I think that proved to be [important].”
Perhaps it was the shell-shock of losing an eight-run lead, or perhaps it was Bigge’s brilliance, but the Big Green only got one hit and didn’t get a man past second base in the seventh, eighth, and ninth.
“[Hunter’s] performance was awesome,” Skinner said. “He came in with a lot of fire, and Hunter’s one of our best guys, and so when he got on the mound, it gave us a little extra confidence boost.”
Bigge’s value added for the team this year is evident on the stat sheet. The Los Gatos, Calif., native hit .273 in 150 plate appearances, hitting four homers, knocking in 22 runs, and posting a .420 slugging percentage. At the same time, he appeared in 10 games on the mound for the Crimson, pitching 29.2 innings and sporting a 3.03 ERA.
“Hunter is—I mean, that guy’s a baller,” McColl said. “He has an interesting demeanor about him because he’s a pretty loose guy at third base, he likes to joke around, stay loose on that end of it. But once he gets on the mound, he just flips the switch and you know it’s lights out. It’s crazy because both sides were hitting the ball all over the place, but Hunter came in and just shut the door.”

Bigge, in addition to his contributions on the mound, also had a big day at the plate. He went 3-for-4 with four RBIs, including a two-run dinger in the third inning and a two-RBI double that kept the rally in the sixth going.
But Bigge wasn’t the only hero for the Crimson. The obvious candidate for the game’s most-clutch honors goes to Rothenberg, who hit two home runs and drove in five runs, including the tying and winning runs in the eighth. The senior also drew a walk and scored thrice.
“It was just a real quick at-bat,” said Rothenberg of the winning eighth-inning homer. “It was just first-pitch fastball and I just got the head out and was able to clear it over the fence. It was quick, it was a blur, and it was a blast.”
Rothenberg thus capped an illustrious Harvard career with a great day at the plate, upping his season average to .292 and posting a season OPS of .829.
“Roth had a great career at Harvard and it was really fun to see him go out that way,” Skinner said. “It was Roth’s day, it really was.”
Junior catcher Devan Peterson hit perhaps the second-most important homer of the day—a three-run shot in the sixth that brought the score from 17-13 to 17-16, making the comeback very realistic and keeping the momentum on the Crimson’s side.
Skinner and sophomore outfielder Jake Suddleson also garnered multi-hit days, with Suddleson’s three-run bomb in the fourth giving Harvard a temporary 9-7 lead. The Crimson’s seven-run sixth also featured RBI hits from McColl and junior outfielder P.J. Robinson.
Senior captain John Fallon, out all year with knee injuries, made a successful comeback with a hit, subsequently scoring on McColl’s RBI single. The gritty return of the team’s leader spurred the team’s and fans’ hearts all series long.
“He’s gotten healthier,” said Decker, who first put Fallon in as a pinch-hitter in game one of the series, the captain’s first plate appearance in two months. “Today, I was like, ‘If we’re going down, we’re going with our captain.’ And he did a great job, he’s a special kid in my life.”
The game saw 36 total hits, with Dartmouth collecting 19 of them and Harvard notching 17. That the Big Green was also having a field day at the plate was evidenced by the fact that four different Dartmouth players had three-RBI days and five players garnered three or more hits.
The game had significant Ivy League Championship Series ramifications. By virtue of Columbia’s series win at Cornell and the previous day’s split between Harvard and Dartmouth, the Crimson’s crazy win sent Columbia to the ILCS to play Yale. If the Big Green had won, it would’ve beat out the Lions for a spot in the championship series.

It’s hard to believe when you can only dream.
When David Ryan stepped on the court on Sunday during No. 3 Harvard’s championship battle against No. 1 Trinity, it was the last match of his squash career. Trinity had already secured the national championship during the first two waves after winning the requisite five matches. Ryan was only playing for pride— primarily playing in the number four slot for the Crimson during the year, there was no way of qualifying for the national individual tournament.
After trading the first four games with the Bantam’s Rick Penders, a blowout final stanza was enough to give Ryan the victory. He would walk away from the centerpiece of his athletic and academic experience with some personal pride, but also collective disappointment that Harvard lost out on the national title to the same team for the second straight year. In his final year, Ryan could not captain his class or team to a national championship. Or so he thought.

The following days of reflection, using time usually reserved for playing squash, were cut short when coach called. After athletes higher in the rankings dropped out of the tournament due to injury, Ryan snatched up the offer of a bid into the College Squash Association (CSA) national individual championship just a couple days before the competition. Ryan had one more chance to play and one more chance to control the outcome. He would not squander that opportunity.
The funny thing is that the accomplishment that defined his season is also the thing that distracts from the outstanding effort that was his senior year campaign. After injuries in previous years and a roller-coaster of lineup locations—number five freshman year, number one sophomore year, number five junior year, and number four senior year, Ryan played his final stanza of squash flawlessly.
The senior, including his 7-0 performance in postseason contests, went a perfect 19-0 on the season. This stood as the best individual performance by a consistent starter on men’s squash, in front of sophomores Timothy Brownell (three losses) and Sean Hughes (two losses—including the first of his collegiate career).
As primarily the number four player in the Crimson’s lineup this past season, Ryan played in the third wave. This allowed him the opportunity to play late into the competition and potentially affect the outcome of the match. Even before the postseason, the senior from Adams House led by example. Ryan went 12-0 in the regular season and 12-0 in the fourth slot in all team competition, including the CSA team national championship series. In tandem with his contributions as a co-captain, he provided a consistent on-the-court presence—down to his final, meaningless match.
But as the glass door closed for the final time during team competition, a new one opened.
As eager as he may had been to seize this next opportunity, Ryan would now have to square off the nation’s best young players that represented the top seeds from their schools. Without the experience of facing top talent in competition for the past two years, Ryan stepped into a veritable gauntlet. The Irishman was completely unfamiliar with his opponents except semifinal opponent and teammate Brownell. He had never faced his challengers in competition— with the exception of his second round Dartmouth opponent that took part in a consolation match at the CSA team national championship during their sophomore years.
The beauty of the situation, however, is not only that Ryan had not meaningfully tangled with his opponents, but also that the opponents had not experience with the upstart. Ryan keyed up on this and flipped the script, forcing the top guns on their heels after they had expected to easily dispatch the lowly 14th seed.
“I just thought I had nothing to lose and why not just go for it all,” Ryan said.
In the opening round, Ryan faced Penn’s number one, Andrew Douglas, to kick off the tournament. Ryan jumped out to a quick two-game lead against the third seed on that Friday morning at the George Washington University hitting grounds, breezing by and conceding just 12 points in the first two games. Douglas woke up in the third game, but by then the upset alert had already sounded and Ryan took match ball in the next frame.
Upsetting one of the top tournament favorites likely sparked a bit of confidence, but the next round only brought more high-level competition, this time in the form of Dartmouth’s Alvin Heumann.
However, the difference between men’s squash co-captain David Ryan and the 2013 Harvard men’s basketball team is—beside the obviously contrasts—that the Dublin native didn’t get knocked out in the second round after beginning the tournament as the 14th seed.
Despite facing him in the national team championship tournament two years prior, Ryan remained unfamiliar with the Big Green product. But a bit of their previous matchup could have lingered because, for the second time, Ryan swept the match against Heumann with a tidy third game after winning by the minimum margin in the first two. Ryan rolled through the first day of competition and earned a spot in the semifinal by dropping just one game.
Coming into Saturday afternoon, Ryan was just one of the successes and storylines from Harvard squash. Both the men’s and women’s teams had managed to place three players in the semifinal round, guaranteeing the Crimson a slot in each of title games.
Saadeldin Abouaish took on fellow No. 1 Kush Kumar in the early semifinal hoping for a better result than the sweep during the team national championship final. But the Harvard sophomore met an identical fate and sent off the top overall seed to the national final.
Just a couple of hours after the lopsided first semifinal, Ryan was engaged in a tight contest to decide the challenger that would face the awaiting former pro and heir apparent to the national championship. The five-set thriller read like a battle with each player going punch for punch, except for the fact that the two young athletes were teammates. Ryan took the first and third games with ease, while Brownell only won by two points in the even frames. The product of high talent and many challenge matches between the teammates was a final, fifth game battle to get to championship game. In the end, Ryan pulled out on top with an 11-7 final frame.
The long match left little time to celebrate before the midday championship bout, although each stage in the tournament was one that Ryan had not foreseen and must have appreciated. And on paper, it seemed likely that this would be his last time to celebrate.
Kumar came into the match better rested after his semifinal finished in the minimum during the previous afternoon. But the Trinity sophomore may have been too relaxed, as seen by Ryan’s quick 11-4 first game victory. From there, the two All-Americans traded until the fifth game.
Characteristic of both of Ryan’s semifinal and final, the final game of the 2017-18 squash season was a back-and-forth affair. The Bantam was able to arrive at championship point, 10-8, with two match balls in hand. At that time, it seemed to line up for the 21-year old sophomore from Chennai, India—the journey from the pro circuit to a small liberal-arts college in Hartford, Conn. would result in his second national championship of the season.
Ryan disrupted this rather neat narrative by saving two match points, and then striking twice more to capture the CSA individual national championship in his final squash game ever. (Citing a lack of financial opportunities on the squash circuit, Ryan is currently set on not continuing his squash career at the professional level.)
Instead, the Crimson’s newest national champion is content leaving the program with one sweet taste of victory left forever in his mouth, in addition to all the contributions responsibilities stemming from his captainship.
“I was not expecting the pressures and the challenges I would face,” Ryan said. “It was almost like being a father and having 17 children and making sure everything is going perfectly.”
The Harvard squash program has a combined 49 team national championships. It may seem like each one is inevitable and will venture by soon or later. But for even for a small, 12-player team like women’s squash, the logistics and efforts to run a smooth season are immense.
“Recognizing how much effort and how much work goes into making a team come together has really given me a different perspective and appreciated the whole process much more,” said women’s squash co-captain Sue Ann Yong.
As difficult as it is to provide for so many close friends, doing so was just as rewarding.
“I have to say the most memorable part of the year was definitely the moments after being the individual championship,” Ryan said. “The teammates that were actually at the tournament stormed the court. My coaches were almost in tears. And when I got back to the airport in Boston, my whole team was there holding posters and champagne and screaming my name. It didn’t feel like an individual championship. It felt like winning a team championship.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From the outset, men’s lightweight assistant coach Ian Accomando said that he and the rest of the coaching staff had a clear focus for the 2017-2018 campaign: a national championship.
“We planned to work harder than we did last year,” Accomando said. “We planned to leave no stone unturned so to speak, and we planned to do that across the whole spectrum of the team, from the top of the program to the bottom of the program.”
After a phenomenal showing at last year’s IRA National Championships, in which the team took the overall points title and the varsity four took the gold, the Harvard men’s lightweight team backed up its 2016-2017 season with a strong campaign this year, remaining undefeated for most of the dual season.

The team most recently finished fourth at the Eastern Sprints Championship behind Columbia, Princeton, and Penn. Given the team’s strong rowing earlier in the season, this result was not satisfactory at all.
“Our goal at the beginning of the year was to win a national championship,” Accomando said. “We finished fourth this past weekend at the Eastern Sprints, which is disappointing to say the least. We are mixing it up. We’re pulling really hard, and we aim to go into Nationals fresh in terms of a new lineup and fitter, stronger, and mentally tougher.”
For senior Andre Dupuis, the results at Eastern Sprints demonstrated how dynamic the league is and how quickly the competition can change.
“Hats off to the competition, to Columbia and all the other crews for some fantastic racing. We’re striving to better ourselves, finding our changes going into IRAs,” Dupuis said.
Despite this late season setback, the team has much to be proud of. In the first dual race of the season, the team outlasted the previous national champion, Cornell, by more than eight seconds and fellow competitor Penn by 15 seconds to take the Mathews-Leonard Cup. After that race, sophomore Hunter Wallace noted that Cornell and Penn would only get faster come championship season.
“I think a weekend like this gives us confidence and what we’re doing with our training is working well,” Wallace said. “Continuing to do that and build off what we have because we know that the next time we see Columbia and Penn and Cornell, those boats are going to be faster.”
Harvard continued to battle and emerge victorious in multiple bouts, defeating both Columbia and Georgetown the next day and capturing the Wales-Kirrane Cup. The top varsity eight finished in 5:53, while Columbia crossed the line in 5:56 and Georgetown finished in 6:06.5.
The same results continued the next week, when the first varsity eight swept past both MIT and Dartmouth to help capture the Biglin Bowl for the Crimson. The depth of the team was also on display as the second varsity boat captured its race and the third, fourth, and fifth boats bested Dartmouth’s 3V.
After that race, junior Jack Stone, coxswain of the top varsity boat, noted that the season was still a long way from completion.
“We’re a month away from Sprints,” Stone said. “We have a tough race against Navy this weekend, and then against Yale and Princeton the weekend after that. We’re going to keep training hard and working hard.”
Consistency was the name of the game, as Harvard took the Haines Cup over Navy and Delaware after an eight hour drive to the Severn River in Annapolis, Maryland. The varsity eight edged out Navy’s boat by less than a second in 6:04.1 in a tight race decided at the finish.
The team’s only blemish on the dual season would come a week later when the crew fell to both Princeton and Yale. The Tigers would pull ahead in the varsity eight in 5:42.7, while the Bulldogs finished a second later and Harvard crossed six seconds after.
Despite losing the Vogel and Goldthwait Cups on that day, the Crimson still competed closely with the top crews in the country. For Sean Hayes, the opportunity to compete with some of the fastest boats in the country was surreal.
“For me, being a freshman, it was really something that I’ve wanted more than anything to compete, particularly at the varsity level, for Harvard, and getting to line up against those crews in particular…was incredible,” Hayes said.
Hayes said that the competitive nature of the team itself contributes to strong performances against other boats. This competitive spirit will drive the boat come June 1-3, when the team travels to New Jersey for the National Championship.
“Right now, we are doing some pretty intense training, also some really, really great training,” Hayes said. “I feel that even in the day that we’ve been training so far, that we made some really great strides. So kind of in lieu of our performance at the Eastern Sprints, we are really shaking things up, and we’re trying to find as much speed as possible.”
This may involve changes in the lineups themselves, according to junior David Wexner.
“You’ll probably see some guys from different boats switching roles, maybe interboat lineup switches because you never really know where you’ll find speed, sometimes in certain combinations, guys just click, so we’ll definitely be thorough in checking all of our options there,” Wexner said.
Dupuis echoed this sentiment and said that the team looks to respond from its Eastern Sprints performance.
“We’re introducing some new things into our training, which I think people on our team have really embraced, just basically identifying the weaknesses we had at Eastern Sprints and working our best to turn these weaknesses into our strengths,” Dupuis said. “I think that has been a key focus from the IRA training.”

Northeastern has a good baseball team.
As of press time, the Huskies are 33-17 overall, are ranked 34th in the Division I RPI standings, and have already won the Colonial Athletic Association standings with a 17-6 conference record. In fact, Northeastern’s 2018 season was also one of its best in program history—only in 1997 and 1991 did the Huskies win 33 or more games in a season.
In the matchup between the Harvard baseball team and Northeastern on April 11, two important factors were at play.
First, Northeastern outranked the Crimson on the RPI rankings by a mile—the Huskies ranked 14th on the April 10 RPI list, while Harvard ranked 157th. Second, the winner of the matchup would take home the 2018 Beanpot Championship title.
The Crimson wasn’t expected to win. In fact, it wasn’t even expected to beat Boston College in the semifinal a week prior. On a humid, cold Wednesday night, losing to the Huskies and taking home a runner-up finish would’ve been respectable.
But talk to the Harvard players, and they’ll tell you that they weren’t the underdogs.
“We were pretty confident in our abilities,” said junior center fielder Ben Skinner. “We came in and we did expect to win that game.”
The Bad Boys of Boston had that kind of confidence about them all year. The Crimson had been playing increasingly well in April and late March and, by the time mid-April rolled around, figured it could skyrocket through the sub-.500 precedent past Harvard teams had set. The Crimson was 12-14 and only looking up.
On the other hand, Northeastern’s squad had several accolades itself—at the time, the Huskies carried a five-game win streak, had won seven of eight, and had only lost once in conference play. By all accounts, after getting swept by No. 10 Texas Tech, Northeastern was rolling.
Both teams were also coming off big late-inning home runs in their respective Beanpot semifinal matchups; Northeastern on an eighth-inning grand slam to beat UMass, and Harvard on an 11th-inning three-run dinger to take down B.C. The championship game had already been delayed once; inclement weather pushed back the Tuesday midweek tilt to a Wednesday afternoon first pitch.
The end result?
A combination of confidence and a loose playstyle meshed to produce an 8-6 comeback Harvard upset victory over Northeastern at Friedman Diamond in Brookline, Mass. This result delivered the Crimson its fourth sole Beanpot championship title and a cornerstone win in one of Harvard’s best seasons in years.
Out of the gates, it didn’t look like the Crimson could pull it off. Fewer than two outs into the game, the Huskies had already scored six times off of junior righty Kevin Stone, sending nine batters to the plate and hitting a grand slam to cap it off. By the time Harvard jogged back to the dugout, it was already 6-0 Northeastern.
Facing a blowout against a strong team, and with little to lose, the Crimson responded.
Third baseman and pitcher Hunter Bigge led off the top of the second with a single. Senior second baseman Matt Rothenberg hustled to get on base after the Northeastern third baseman mishandled a ground ball. Then, with two outs, junior catcher Devan Peterson mashed an RBI double to right-center to produce two sorely-needed runs in response to the Huskies’ six-spot a frame prior.
Suddenly, the score was 6-2, and thoughts of an easy blowout were gone. Could Harvard produce yet another comeback, something it had done all year long?
“As soon as we started to get a little offensive production going, momentum swung back in our direction,” Skinner said. “Once the ball got rolling, we all got the feeling of, ‘Here we go again, here come the Bad Boys of Boston making the comeback….’”
After a rough first, Stone settled down and recorded a relatively uneventful, clean bottom of the second. The scoreless inning kept Harvard’s momentum alive—it was now clear that the Huskies weren’t going to run away with it very easily.
“We knew there was a lot of game left, so we just focused on chipping away,” Skinner said. “We’ve been in a position before where we dipped down and came back, so we still remained confident. We were taking it one inning at a time, trying to climb our way back into the ballgame.”
The confidence is one thing. The second factor that pushed the comeback over the edge was the Crimson’s ability to play its best when it plays “loose”—fun, relaxed, and without any pressure on. With a good dugout vibe going, Harvard made erasing a 6-2 deficit look easy.
“We have a pretty loose attitude about us this year,” said junior first baseman Pat McColl. “We play better when we’re loose, so we try to keep it fun and have a good atmosphere in the dugout.”
Wellesley, Mass., native and freshman right fielder Tommy Seidl set the stage in the top of the third with a leadoff walk. McColl, perhaps the team’s offensive MVP this year, followed with a base knock to move Seidl to third.
Junior outfielder P.J. Robinson kept the rally going with an RBI hit to second base and make the score 6-3.
Three batters later, with the bases juiced, Rothenberg knocked in McColl with a single to right, closing the gap to just two runs.
Freshman shortstop and Duxbury, Mass., native Buddy Mrowka then delivered the loudest hit. The rookie made the Huskies pitching staff pay with a bases-clearing triple to the deepest part of the diamond, giving Harvard a decisive 7-6 lead. Peterson’s sac fly a batter later topped it off.
Comeback complete.
“We kind of have a phrase on our team, ‘Show ’em you’re tougher’, so that was definitely a ‘Show ’em you’re tougher’ game,” Skinner said. “The spirit of the team this year was kind of to battle through the elements or anything else that was thrown at us.”
Stone went on to pitch five innings, putting up four goose eggs in a row, and junior John MacLean and sophomore Kieran Shaw combined to shut out the Huskies for the rest of the game. After Shaw got a swinging strikeout to end the game, the Crimson lifted an unexpected Beanpot trophy and began celebrating.
The locals knew what it mean to bring home the silver trophy.
“Especially being a local guy, growing up with the Beanpot, [winning the title] means a lot,” said Seidl. “It’s a big deal around here, not so much for the rest of the country—but definitely for me and the local guys, it means a lot.”
The big win over a strong team made the win all the more special.
“It’s a big-time win for us,” Peterson said. “I’ve been dreaming about winning the Beanpot ever since I came to college. Now, to have that trophy on the bus with us, it’s an unbelievable feeling.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When you’ve been winning for 88 years, it’s hard to make a season stand out. As problems go, it’s a good one to have, but it’s the problem that the Harvard men’s swimming and diving team faced at the beginning of the 2017-2018 campaign.
The Crimson has never finished with a losing season since it began competing in 1930, and the last and only time that the program failed to cross the .500 mark was 1971, when Harvard completed the year at 5-5. Over the same period, the Crimson has amassed 19 undefeated campaigns. Needless to say, this year’s Harvard squad needed to come up with something extraordinary to make the season memorable.
In the end, it more than managed. En route to finishing the season undefeated for a 20th time and picking up a 25th Ivy League title, the Crimson had a year marked by breakout performances, incredible showings from established contributors, and revenge for the team’s veterans.
All three elements were on full display as Harvard cruised to the Ancient Eight title at the Ivy League Championship Meet. The contest had special significance for the team’s older members, who lost to Princeton by a mere 21.5 points at the same bout in 2016. The Crimson was denied a chance to even the score last season, with the Tigers barred from competition, although they did take back the Ancient Eight championship. This time around, with the opportunity to beat out its fierce rivals directly and erase the memory of two years ago, Harvard made sure to capitalize.

On the back of a solid team-wide effort and standout performances from several of its athletes, the Crimson eclipsed Princeton and the rest of the league, finishing with 1650.5 points. The Tigers ended the meet with 1285.5.
“It was incredible,” senior Koya Osada said. “I certainly kept our loss to Princeton in the back of my mind when training got tough or I needed the extra bit of motivation.  Any time you can capture the title in a competitive conference like the Ivy League, it’s an honor, and I couldn’t have asked for a better ending to my collegiate career nor a better group of guys to do it with.”
Junior Brennan Novak and sophomore Dean Farris played a crucial role in securing the victory, with the duo’s efforts earning them a joint share of the Phil Moriarty Award, given to the high-point swimmer for the meet.
The pair set five new Ivy League Championship and Harvard records between them, winning every event they competed in and contributing to 10 victories. Farris smashed the previous-best times in the 200-yard freestyle, 100 backstroke, and 200 backstroke, while Novak cleaned up in the distance events, finishing with record marks in the 500 and 1000 freestyle races.
Farris’ time in the 200 free was the fastest in the nation at the time, earning the sophomore an NCAA A-cut designation and the top seed at the national championships. Two Crimson seniors added A-cut performances of their own on the boards, with co-captain Bobby Ross and senior David Pfeifer finishing fourth and sixth, respectively.
The pair’s success was reflective of the leadership that the team’s upperclassmen provided not only during the Ivy League meet but throughout the season.
“This senior class not only set a great attitude within the pool during practices and competition but were leaders across campus and amazing mentors to underclassmen in our academics and other endeavors,” sophomore Daniel Chang said. “I think everyone can agree on this team that our success was in large part due to their leadership, and we gave it our all at Ivies to send them off with a bang.”
The benefit of the collective experience of the Crimson’s seniors and other veteran members was demonstrated in the first few meets of the season. The team opened the campaign with decisive victories over Dartmouth, Cornell, and Columbia, winning each the three contests by an average of 127 points. That margin was greater than the points totals of any of Harvard’s first three opponents.
The team’s experienced members were crucial to the early season wins. Novak and fellow senior Ed Kim each picked up two solo victories against Dartmouth and Cornell, while Farris won the 100-yard backstroke and Ross and Pfeifer took the one-meter and three-meter dives, respectively.
Farris, Houck, and Novak led the team once again against Columbia, with the former two setting a trio of pool records between them. Farris, Kim, and seniors Steven Tan and Paul O’Hara also combined to set a new pool-best mark in the 200 freestyle relay.
The Crimson faced its first true test of the season in then-No. 10 Arizona State.
“I would say that our dual meet against Arizona State was the best meet of the season,” Osada said. “It was the perfect test for our team. Going into the meet, I think our team was a bit scared to be honest because ASU was ranked top 10 in the country, and we knew how tough their swimmers and divers were.”
While Harvard’s experience was once again decisive, strong performances from some of the team’s newer members helped the Crimson edge out the Sun Devils, 155-143.
Novak, Kim, and Tan all had strong showings, with Tan contributing two solo wins and a pair of relay victories, but the team’s veteran corps had help from a pair of less-experienced athletes in Chang and freshman Michael Zarian. Chang topped his previous personal best for the season in the 200-yard breaststroke to touch the wall first, while Zarian picked up a gold medal result in the 200-yard butterfly. Both finishes added crucial points to help Harvard knock off a top-10 team and send a message on the national level.
“It was amazing to see our team progress and grow within the short span of this dual meet because you could tell that as the meet went on, we started to believe that we could win and our confidence grew,” Osada said. “Our win against ASU gave us the extra boost of confidence that we needed before Ivy League Championships and NCAAs.”
The Crimson cruised through the remainder of the regular season thanks to consistently strong performances across the team. Wins for Houck, Chang, Farris, and Ross helped steer Harvard past Penn, while Farris, Novak, Ross, and sophomore Raphael Marcoux each picked up solo victories against Bryant and Rider to secure a pair of positive results.
The team’s final contest of the season had higher stakes, with the Crimson facing off against archrivals Princeton and Yale for the conference dual meet championship. Harvard wasn’t fazed by the pressure, though, and the Crimson swept past both opponents by more than 100 points each to secure a second consecutive Ancient Eight regular season title in its home pool.
The meet featured a bevy of standout swims, highlighted by a trio of solo victories for Farris and a new Blodgett Pool record for Novak in the 500 free. On the boards, Pfeifer dominated, achieving first in the three-meter dive.
Harvard carried that momentum through its outright Ivy League title at the conference meet and into the NCAA championships in March. Ranked 24th in the country heading into the contest, the Crimson bested its seed to finish 18th in the nation.
Farris once again led the way, garnering six All-America honors and breaking program records in the 50-yard freestyle and the 800 free relay. The Atlanta, Ga., native also raced to a sixth-place finish in the 200 free, touching the wall behind two Olympic gold medalists and a World Championships gold medalist. Farris added to his award total with a seventh-place result in the 200 backstroke, also good for first team All-America.
“Dean did really well at NCAAs,” Ross said. “We were all watching him and the other guys back at Harvard. He led our team in points this year at the meet and helped us get a solid finish, and just being a sophomore, we're all really excited to see what he can do next year as well.”
Novak and Houck also chipped in considerable points, racking up three honorable mention All-America honors between them. O’Hara, Tan, Marcoux, sophomore Zach Snyder, and freshman Mahlon Reihman picked up honorable mention All-America awards as well for their efforts in the relay events.
With the 18th-place finish, Harvard outpaced several highly-ranked teams in the overall standings, including No. 8 Arizona State, No. 13 Missouri, and No. 19 Notre Dame. The result sees the Crimson take one more step towards realizing its goal of becoming a national powerhouse program.
Overall, even against the backdrop of nearly 90 years of success, this season stood out for the Crimson. The team captured a second consecutive regular season title, finished undefeated for the third time in four years, and reclaimed the Ivy League championship from bitter rival Princeton. Harvard also used the momentum of a victory over top-10 opponent ASU to make a mark on the national stage, finishing inside the top-20 at NCAAs.
While the leadership of the team’s seniors will be missed, breakout performances from a handful of new faces and strong showings from established returners will leave the team confident heading into the coming season. With that in mind, and despite all the successes of the 2017-2018 campaign, the Crimson is already looking ahead to next season.
“I think we had an amazing season overall,” Farris said. “Now we look to build on that success for next year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is rare to encounter a player with as much passion and commitment to basketball as sophomore guard Katie Benzan. Born just ten miles from Harvard’s campus, Benzan’s contributions to the Harvard women’s basketball team set her apart from her peers.
Despite breaking the all-time record for three-pointers in a season for the Ivy League—knocking down 99 triples—Benzan’s season culminated in a bittersweet manner. The Crimson fell two wins short of an Ancient Eight title, the only prize that the Wellesley, Mass., native has been fixated on recently.
“We just have to keep working and getting better,” Benzan said. “Every day, just a little bit better, so that come next March, when we’re hopefully at the Ivy League tournament again, all that work can help us beat whoever we’re playing.”
In spite of the disappointing end, Benzan’s season was an integral part of Harvard’s success, especially within the confines of Lavietes Pavilion where the team finished the season with an unbeaten, 12-0 record. After losing in the first round of the Ivy League tournament in her freshman season, Benzan returned to Cambridge committed to helping the Crimson win an Ancient Eight title.
“Katie has natural skill, but she doesn’t rely on that,” senior guard Taylor Rooks said. “She puts all the time in, plus some, to get herself as ready as possible. I’ve never met anyone so passionate about the game of basketball. Her IQ, her skill level—she contributes so much to our team.”
A first team All-Ivy League unanimous selection, Benzan’s steady performance throughout the season only improved during conference play—the sharpshooting guard knocked down an impressive 50 percent of her 102 three-point efforts in Ancient Eight competition. Beyond athletics, Benzan also garnered recognition for her academic efforts, as she was named to the 2018 Winter Academic All-Ivy team.
Despite leading the team in points, minutes, three-point shooting, and assists, much of Benzan’s responsibilities are centered around her leadership. Urgently encouraging teammates during timeouts in a manner uncanny for a player so young, Benzan contributes far more than just statistics to Harvard. The work ethic that the guard has exhibited since arriving in Cambridge is never more apparent than before contests, where Benzan will hoist three-pointers in the hour leading up to tip-off, often the only player on the court.
“She has had a lot of responsibility, since the day she stepped on campus as a freshman, and she’s handled it incredibly well,” Rooks said. “Her growth has been incredible, and I can only see her getting better, as a player and as a leader.”
Benzan’s impact on the Crimson was epitomized by the team’s 55-52 victory over Penn in February, Harvard’s first victory over the Quakers in nine meetings. Struggling mightily from beyond the arc, Benzan converted just one of her nine field goals, seven of which were three-point attempts.

In spite of an uncharacteristic night shooting the basketball, the sophomore played 38 of the game’s 40 minutes, chipping in four assists and three steals. With seconds remaining, Benzan stepped to the free throw line with a chance to ice the game, having only scored three points at that point. The 83 percent free throw shooter coolly knocked down both shots, sealing a victory that stood out as a turning point in the Crimson’s season.
The five-point effort, one of her lowest point totals of the season, encapsulated Benzan’s desire to put team success above individual statistics.
“I don’t really think about stats,” Benzan said. “ I just want to win. That’s why I came here.”
For Harvard to achieve its goal of winning an Ivy League title in the next two seasons, and the berth to the NCAA Tournament that accompanies it, Benzan must continue to help anchor the team, both statistically and through her leadership.

With an undergraduate student population over six times larger than Harvard’s and the capability to offer athletic scholarships, Penn State doesn’t ostensibly belong in the same Division I conference as the Crimson. But in men’s volleyball it is, and for 30 near-consecutive years, the Nittany Lions have beat up on their division rival.
It’s not just Harvard that Penn State has dominated. The Nittany Lions have historically loomed over the entire the Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association—for 11 consecutive seasons, Penn State has reigned as at least the EIVA shared regular-season champion.
Against the Crimson, the Nittany Lions’ 30-year streak—exempting one Harvard win—extended into 2018. Heading into the first match between the squads in 2018, the story was already written. The Crimson entered the matchup with a 1-7 record and Penn State boasted a match count of 5-2.
Three days after Valentine’s Day, in that first match of a season that would feature two guaranteed meetings between the squads, the Nittany Lions showed no love for Harvard, downing the conference rival in a clean three-set sweep. In that contest, the Crimson pushed the first set past the 25-point threshold, forcing Penn State to get the win in 28 points. After that, the Nittany Lions won the next two sets by 11 and seven points, respectively. The showing indicated that 2018 might be a season like all the rest, another year of Penn State hegemony.
But Harvard started to turn things around.
By the time the Crimson lined up across the net from the Nittany Lions again on the last day of March, the team possessed six consecutive conference wins and a resume that included competition against some of the nation’s top talent. This included a loss to No. 1, and the eventual national champion, Long Beach State.
Harvard's home fans showed up in full force in this second and final guaranteed matchup between the squads, leaving no seat unfilled on the fourth floor of the Malkin Athletic Center in Cambridge, Mass.
The Crimson hit first and hit hard.
From the initial point of the first set—a kill from co-captain Riley Moore—Harvard dominated the opening round of play. Things between the two seemed pretty even until a kill by junior Trevor Dow granted the Crimson a three-point margin. Another point, a Penn State timeout, and then one more tally built a five point buffer for Harvard.  A service error returned the serve to the Nittany Lions, but the Crimson did not relent for long. Dow clocked two aces—sandwiched between Penn State attack errors—to push the the Crimson lead to eight, a lead Harvard only continued to build on.
The ensuing 25-13 set win was the largest point differential in the series since the Nittany Lions bested the Crimson by the same amount in April of 2012. The win was enough to rattle Penn State, as Harvard hadn’t even tabbed a set on the team in three years.
“In the fifth set, Coach [Brian] Baise put it on the seniors to make sure we pulled through and got this victory for the team,” Moore said. “I think we took that confidence he put in us and used it to finish out the match.”
In the opening of set two, propelled by five kills, the visiting squad pushed into an early 7-4 lead. But the Crimson was still on fire, and a kill by Brad Gretsch followed by two Nittany Lions attack errors moved the score back to a level seven. From there, the entire set proceeded as evenly as it possibly could. The fat lady didn’t sing until Harvard reached 32, finally securing its second set win.
Two clean set wins by Penn State pushed the affair into its fifth and final set. Initially tied at 6-6, the Crimson pushed ahead with five of the next six points to secure the set and match win—the second in 30 years.

“I thought our guys did a really good job,” Harvard coach Brian Baise said. “To come up with a win like that, under pressure, shows a lot.”
The Crimson dominated in blocks against the tall team, clocking 11.5 blocks to the visitor’s 4.5. Meanwhile, Dow led the match with seven individual stops at the net. Harvard found further success in the defensive court with sophomore Matt Ctvrtlik claiming a team-high 10. Moore led the team in kills with 14.
With the win, the Crimson claimed sole possession of second place within the EIVA and earned the opportunity to win the division in the regular season. More importantly, it completely removed the Nittany Lions from contention, ultimately soiling its streak atop the division.
“Obviously it’s a situation we’d like to be in at this point in the season, but it also means that we have to fight for these last four games,” sophomore Erik Johnsson said. “It also means that we have a chance to win the conference which is something we haven’t been able to do in a long time.”
Harvard ultimately moved on to win the EIVA tournament and advance to the NCAA tournament for the first time in program history.
“This win meant a ton to our team, as it validated all of the hard work we had put in and gives us confidence as we head towards playoffs that we can compete with the best teams,” Moore said. “It was also a very special win for the seniors… and being able to do it at home in front of family and friends made it even more special.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rhianna Rich was born to play softball.
“After I was born my older sister had a softball game, so instead of going home from the hospital I went straight to a softball field,” Rich said.
It didn’t take long for Rich to follow in the footsteps of her older sisters, who played at the collegiate level at Columbia and Stanford. As soon as she set foot on Harvard’s campus, she established herself as the team’s starting shortstop. Now in the spring of her junior year, Rich has been a model of consistency for three straight seasons.
Her career numbers are staggering: a .410 batting average (which at the moment is the highest in Harvard history), an OPS north of 1.000, 178 hits, and just 21 strikeouts in 128 games and 483 plate appearances. But perhaps most interesting are her 17 triples.
“I’d say some of the time it’s teams kind of underestimate how far I can hit the ball, so they play me in a little more than typical players because I’m also pretty small too,” Rich said. “And then whenever I do hit the ball into the gap I’m automatically thinking three or two. No matter where the ball is, that’s my mentality and I think that really helps a lot because there’s no hesitation on my part.”
Though she leads off and hits from the left side of the plate, Rich is not a slap hitter. She approaches her at-bats with a mentality more similar to a typical middle of the order hitter, patiently waiting for the right pitch and shooting for the gaps.
This season was no exception to Rich’s extraordinary career performance. The shortstop hit .436 with an 1.129 OPS, racked up an Ivy-leading six triples and 42 runs scored, swiped seven bases, and slammed two home runs.
Some of the statistics are hard to believe. During an 11-game hitting streak between April 7 and April 29, Rich went 22-for-33 with 10 runs scored, nine RBI, three doubles, two triples, and a home run. After March 13, she struck out just one time.
For her accomplishments at the plate and in the field in 2018, Rich was unanimously selected to the All-Ivy team at shortstop by the conference’s coaches. The junior joins classmates Katie Duncan (Ivy Pitcher of the Year) and second baseman Meagan Lantz and senior co-captain Maddy Kaplan on the first team.

Despite her machine-like consistency throughout the years, Rich has evolved significantly as a player and a teammate. She has taken on a larger leadership role, which has been crucial to the Crimson’s continued success this season. The co-captain and outfield duo of Kaplan and junior Kaitlyn Schiffhauer are the team’s de facto leaders, but Rich captains the infield in her own way.
“She’s not a vocal leader,” coach Jenny Allard said. “Rhi leads by example. You love to watch Rhianna play the game—she’s that type of an athlete. But she doesn’t have to say a lot because she’s capable of doing so much, so when she does speak it really matters.”

Lantz, who is Rich’s new double play partner, echoes her coach’s words, pointing to the pair’s chemistry up the middle and Rich’s leadership by example.
“I’m so lucky that I have the opportunity to play with someone like her,” Lantz said. “She’s just somebody that pushes everybody on the team to be better, and she is truly an inspiration through her natural talent.”
Along with her evolution as a leader, Rich has made continuous strides with her defense—crucial since her’s is a premier defensive position—in terms of throwing on the run and ranging to either side. She’s also become more of a situational hitter.
“I think I really worked on outside pitches and then being a better leadoff for the team,” Rich said. “I felt like last season I let the team down in some ways because my first at-bat leading off for the team, it could’ve been either a better at-bat or a better result, so I felt like mentally I was really focused on getting the team excited about the game by being that spark for the top of the lineup.”
The secret behind Rich’s ability to improve upon an already elite skill set? Work, work, and more work. A couple of weeks after the season ends, she goes home to El Segundo, Calif., to get in cage work and to stay in shape. Over the course of the summer, she only spends about two weeks away from softball.
“Once the season ends it’s pretty heartbreaking for me, and I’m still really in softball mode,” Rich said. “I don’t really enjoy the lax time—I like to get out there and grind it out.”
Allard noticed all these traits in Rich from the very start, and she especially extolled her starting shortstop’s consistency, noting that she would make every play, always swing hard, and give maximum effort during every game. Allard also pointed to Rich’s ability to see the game, knowing what plays need to be made and matching her skills to what the team needs at any given moment.
“I always know that when she’s up something’s going to happen,” Lantz added. “When she’s up at the plate, whether there are runners on or there’s nobody on, Rhianna’s a spark plug, and she can really get an inning rolling. In the field, she makes tough plays look routine, and she makes it look so smooth all the time. There’s not really much more you can ask.”
Rich’s determination and drive—along with the rest of her team’s—booked Harvard a date in the NCAA Regionals against No. 9 Georgia, which has the seventh seed in the 64-team tournament. The Crimson ultimately lost its opening round game to the Bulldogs and subsequently fell in an elimination game against California.
For the third straight year, Harvard took on a fellow Ivy team in the league’s championship series. The previous two seasons concluded with losses to Princeton, which went on to face elimination in each of its attempts at regionals. This time, however, the Crimson triumphed over Dartmouth and won the conference for the first time since 2012.
Regardless of the result this weekend, however, Rich is just looking to take advantage of her last calendar year as a member of the Crimson.
“I’ve been dreaming of [winning the Ivy League and going to regionals] for every day the past three years that I’ve been here,” Rich said. “But I think if we’re talking about personally for next year, I think it’s to enjoy my last year playing softball.... I love my team and I’m happy that I get to finish out my last year with HSB.”

Ahead of the 2017 season, Crimson softball was just beginning offseason practices in the bubble over Harvard Stadium. Junior infielder Meagan Lantz stepped up to serve as a baserunner in a defensive situation drill. She sprinted from home to first, cutting to her right once she had run through the bag. She immediately felt something was off—later testing revealed that she had torn her ACL in her right knee.
“At the time I didn’t think it was a complete tear,” Lantz said. “I didn’t think I’d be out for the season. It was shocking, but it kind of just goes to show you how precious every moment is on the field and how you can’t take anything for granted, and that definitely taught me a lot.”
All of a sudden, one of Harvard’s key 2016 contributors was done for the season. In her rookie year, Lantz hit .323/.375/.577 with seven home runs, 34 runs scored, 37 RBI, and 10 steals. Now, Harvard would have to replace her production as it aimed to maintain its standing as one of the Ivy League’s top teams.
“She’s such a competitive athlete,” coach Jenny Allard said. “She absolutely loves to play, and to have that happen within the first week of winter training was devastating to her. She had never ever been injured, so your heart breaks when someone’s going to have a season-ending injury to the level that she did.”
In the meantime, Lantz’s role on the team evolved. She became a de facto team manager and a leader on the bench, helping coaches with various tasks in games and practices and motivating her teammates.
According to Allard, support from injured athletes is crucial in making things happen behind the scenes. This year, senior Morgan Macchiarulo took on a similar role.
“I think it made me realize how important every single member of this team is,” Lantz said. “It doesn’t take one or two people to be really key to a team’s success. It really is a full team effort, and everyone is really needed.”
Once the season came to a close, Lantz returned home to Parkland, Fla., to ramp up her rehab process. First she had to work her way back to walking normally, regaining full extension and range of motion in her knee. After that, the area around the knee had to be strengthened as much as possible to avoid further injury.
When Lantz returned to campus, she worked closely with the softball coaching staff, team trainers, and the strength and conditioning staff. Approximately six to nine months after the initial ACL injury is when athletes can typically return to their sport, and Harvard trainers gradually guided Lantz back into softball mode, instilling patience the whole way.
From the outset of this season, Lantz did not show any hesitation or ill effects from the injury. She played in all 39 of the team’s games, and she even made a full-time switch full to a position that demands more lateral movement. She split time between third and second in her freshman campaign, but she moved over to second base more permanently this year following the emergence of junior third baseman Erin Lockhart.
“I think there were definitely some nerves coming back,” Lantz said. “We opened preseason in Florida. I’m from Florida, so it was nice to be back in my home state, and we were playing on fields that I had played on when I was growing up, so I think that kind of gave a bit of a comfort level. Once I got past the initial nerves and butterflies, it was just business as usual being on the field with Harvard softball.”
Lantz—along with teammates Maddy Kaplan, Katie Duncan, and Rhianna Rich—was named an All-Ivy player for her 2018 campaign. The junior hit .358/.405/.533 with four homers, a team-leading 10 doubles, 21 runs, and 20 driven in.
“Just her return to the level she’s gotten herself to, following such a significant injury, is just so impressive,” Allard said. “It speaks to her determination, it speaks to her effort, it speaks to her drive and her desire to come back and play the game she loves. She, I think, came back even stronger.”
Perhaps most impressive, though, were her 16 stolen bases. That mark was second in the Ivy League, behind only Yale’s Shelby Kennedy, who had 21 in 26 attempts. Lantz, however, was only caught twice.
According to Rich, a lot of teams do not expect a hitter in the third spot in the lineup to be exceptionally fast. Getting runners into scoring position for the power hitters that follow in the order, such as Lockhart and sophomore first baseman Olivia Giaquinto, is key.
“I didn’t think I’d be stealing a lot, but when coach gives you the steal signal, you’ve just got to go with it and do what you can to slide into the base and make it work,” Lantz said. “But it’s been fun. I definitely have enjoyed being a little more aggressive on the bases.”
Rich, who has 25 career steals and is the team’s leadoff hitter, thinks she still has a slight edge over Lantz in terms of speed.
“I think I might be a little faster just based off of testing that we’ve done,” said Rich with a laugh. “But we’re different types of athletes. She’s definitely the fastest right-hander we have.”
Though Lantz may or may not be able to claim the distinction of Harvard softball’s fastest runner, she reaped greater rewards this season: a return to her outstanding freshman year form and a chance to compete in the NCAA tournament.
“She is one of the hardest workers on our team and she worked day in and day out to get back to where she was,” Rich said. “We all are super proud of her and what she’s been able to accomplish, and I think everyone knew she had the physical capacity to get past her injury. She’s such a strong athlete and she has this determination. With these types of injuries, it’s just about being mentally strong enough to push past it, and she was.”

Since the 1995-1996 season, the Harvard men and women’s basketball teams have collectively raised 14 Ivy League championship banners in Lavietes Pavilion, the second-oldest Division I basketball facility in the nation. For all who have donned a Crimson jersey from Allison Feaster ’98 to Siyani Chambers ’17, one part of their college careers remained the same: the basketball facility had not changed since its $2.1 million facelift in 1995.
After several years of debate and planning, Lavietes Pavilion welcomed another chapter in its history in the fall of 2017, expanding and modernizing the home of Harvard Basketball with a renovation costing upwards of $15 million dollars. The new amenities include a 5,000 square feet expansion to accommodate a new entrance lobby, ticketing areas, and locker rooms, as well as a new state-of-the-art scoreboard, bleachers, and skylight/roof replacement.
These significant upgrades to Lavietes Pavilion were seen as much-needed and vital to the continued development of the basketball programs, according to several donors and coaching staff. Additionally, there currently no longer appears to be a definitive plan to move forward with the construction of a new basketball arena, as originally proposed in the 2013 Institutional Master Plan.
In that proposal, a 3,000-seat basketball facility in the Barry’s Corner District of Allston was outlined as one of seven envisioned projects to be completed by 2023, which would encompass 60,000 sq. feet of space alongside an additional 10,000-30,000 sq. feet for retail use and over 200,000 sq.feet of university-owned housing. The arena would be situated on university-owned property at 175 North Harvard Street, then home of the Education Portal.

The assessments by the Harvard Planning & Project Management Office at that time stated that existing facility renovations to Lavietes Pavilion would not be the preferred option to meet the University’s needs, commenting on page 137 in the 2013 IMP:
“Major renovation of the Lavietes building, Harvard’s current basketball venue, was considered and, while feasible, was not viewed as the best means of achieving the goals stated above. This 1925 facility is considered undersized, and would require extensive building system improvements, and if renovated would still not produce a basketball arena comparable to that of the planned new facility.”
Although specific details of the proposed new arena were not explicit in the plan, the basketball facility and accompanying retail/housing space were envisioned as a new centerpiece for the development of the Barry’s Corner District. The basketball facility promised to bring “comfortable seating with excellent sight lines and acoustics” that would “optimize event atmosphere for athletes and Harvard community in the spirit of Ivy League competition.”
Following the announcement of the IMP in October of 2012, Harvard men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker stated that this Allston expansion would, if successful, “make this environment that much better for all of our students, employees, and faculty” and attract “even higher level recruits.”
In 2012, Director of Athletics Bob Scalise echoed similar sentiments and further expressed his optimism for the potential new basketball venue.
“This is a master planning project, and what we’re trying to do is make sure we have things that might happen in the next 10 or 15 years in the mix,” Scalise said. “[But] it’s really too early to say. It’s such a preliminary scope out of what it would be right now, but it’s nice that [a new stadium is] being considered in the Allston plan.”

In the years following this announcement, it appears that the University has taken an alternative direction and that those around the basketball program are pleased and satisfied with the ultimate decision to renovate the existing facility. As to the official tabling of the new basketball arena construction proposal now halfway into the ten-year span of the original 2013 master plan, the University has as of May 20 declined to comment directly on whether or not the Mixed Use Facility and Basketball Venue is out of picture.
“Harvard’s 2013 10-year Institutional Master Plan includes a Mixed Use Facility and Basketball Venue, and this project remains an aspirational one for the University,” University spokesperson Aaron M. Goldman wrote. “The successful renovation of Lavietes Pavilion was necessary to rehabilitate and add to the existing space, to provide a great experience for students and spectators alike, and to keep pace in a competitive recruiting environment.”
Despite the arena project continuing to be “aspirational”, there have been no indications within internal discussions to suggest that a new basketball facility will be in consideration by 2023. When choosing to renovate Lavietes, it appeared that this decision was an agreed-to upon alternative but that there was a not a plan to move forward with both projects.
Women’s basketball head coach Kathy Delaney Smith was inside several of those decision-making sessions alongside Amaker and ultimately favored preserving usage of the existing Lavietes Pavilion.
“I appreciate that we were involved in all the planning and it was interesting going into a whole new facility, or keeping the history of Harvard,” Delaney-Smith said. “I was leaning toward the history of Lavietes. I was very much in favor of that.”
Joe Carrabino, Co-Chair of Friends of Harvard Basketball, confirmed that no discussions were raised as to potential fundraising for a new facility as of April 2nd.
“The only project the Friends were asked to assist in was the renovation of Lavietes Pavilion,” Carrabino wrote in an email.
“I am not aware of any discussion whatsoever in terms of the new arena," said William Mannix '81, a fellow Co-Chair. "I don't think that is on the table."
This transition away from a new arena construction first began in 2014, when the University commissioned program management firm Brailsford & Dunlavey, Inc. to offer a feasibility assessment for modernizing and expanding Lavietes Pavilion, with a then total budget cost of $5 million. The project’s goal, according to the firm’s website, was to “indicate excitement and energy, attract talent, and create a feel of a higher level of basketball, all while retaining the arena’s “historic charm.”

Fred Schernecker ’89, a co-chair for the Friends of Harvard Basketball, emphasized how the leadership and vision of Amaker was instrumental in the transition towards revitalizing Lavietes. Amaker, according to conversations with Schernecker, drew numerous analogies to Fenway Park in describing how an older facility can be renovated to cater to both history and modern expectations.
“We have been talking in a lot of different ways for a long time if it made sense to build a new basketball facility versus renovating the existing [facility],” Schernecker said. “The decision came down to trying to renovate the existing, and Tommy had a great vision for the facility.”
Schernecker added that the Mixed Use Facility and Basketball Venue was included in the 2013 Institutional Master Plan to allow the University to build a new facility if the basketball department decided it was the best course of action to take, but that there was never a definitive plan to move forward with the new facility.
“There wasn’t a plan to build a new arena. What there was was a placeholder in the Allston Plan to where a new basketball gym could go if that was the direction that was taken,” Schernacker said.
...
With the completion of the renovated Lavietes Pavilion, Harvard Basketball is now firmly established inside its new state-of-the-art facility. From the perspective of numerous players, coaches, and community members, the Lavietes Pavilion renovation has, from their perspective, been well-received and much-needed.
“It is by far the best in every regard,” Delaney-Smith said. “The locker rooms, the off the field rooms, everything is first class and I know the athletes love it. We are very grateful that we have it, because it is a lot of hard work and a lot of money from a lot of different people. We are very grateful to have it.”
Although Delaney-Smith jocularly added that “you don’t choose Harvard for the facilities,” Amaker acknowledged in a preseason press conference that the renovations will have some effect towards recruiting and the exterior image of Harvard Basketball.
“Certainly for prospective students coming in and taking it all in, you want it to excite and energize and I think it does exactly that,” Amaker said. “It will make it even better if we can win here. But we will see, we are see how it all shakes out but we are very proud of it and excited to have this opportunity to have this facility.”
For former Crimson players that previously played games in the sweltering heat of the fourth floor of the now-Malkin Athletic Center or shared turf space during the winter with baseball and lacrosse teams, the evolution of the basketball program has also been remarkable. Carrabino was part of the first team in 1982 to play inside Lavietes, and has thoroughly been impressed by the changes made within this facility.
“Over time, the facilities have gotten better and the fan experience better,” Carrabino wrote. “There is no comparison to what existed in the past—today the players playing and the fan watching are treated to a first class basketball environment compared to the fourth floor of the [Malkin Athletic Center.”
In reciprocating these words, many supporters of the program have cited enhancements in both in-game experience and the overall aesthetics of the arena. With the inclusion of the four-screen jumbotron, cheering attendees are often displayed on the new “Fan-Cam” or other interactive activities, such as doing the “Titanic” pose during timeouts. Prior to games, a video montage of the team is featured as the starting lineup is announced.
For long-time Harvard Basketball supporters, these in-game improvements have made an immediate impact in their overall experience.
“When I first went to a game there I was so blown away,” said Jiwei Sun ’18, a long-time student supporter. “Everything is just so much newer. It feels like there is more space in the bleachers too. I also like how they have the tunnel you can walk under to get around. And then the jumbotron it is super nice, it is awesome. It is fun having all the fam cams and stuff.”
Others have also appreciated the allusions to Harvard architecture inside the new building that provide a balance between the past and present of the program.
“I thought our coaches, the Athletic Department and the architects worked together to design a building that was once generic and, with the renovations, reflects the uniqueness of Harvard University,” wrote Prof. Kevin Madigan, Faculty Fellow for Harvard Women’s Basketball. “I see this, for example, in the lovely brick walls, which of course allude to our bricked walkways and bricked buildings.  The scoreboard makes it easy to keep track of statistics, team fouls, and other numbers important for serious fans.”
Alongside honoring the history of the university as a whole, multiple players have cited the importance of dedicating this new facility to important alumni who have helped elevate the program. During the Feb. 17 win against Yale, former team captain Siyani Chambers ’17 returned to Lavietes during a midseason break from his professional team in Austria, BC Raiffeisen Flyers Wels. Following the contest, multiple Crimson players commented on Chamber’s legacy at the building.
“If anyone really deserved to reap the benefits of the renovation, I think [Siyani] was definitely one of those people,” sophomore guard Christian Juzang said.
“It would have been nice to have [Siyani] play on this new court and new renovation, but seeing him see us play on it is cool,” second-year forward Seth Towns added.

Alongside Chambers, numerous other alumni and basketball royalty have visited the renovated Lavietes Pavilion in its inaugural season. Jayson Tatum, the 2017 first-round pick for the Boston Celtics, was courtside during the Crimson Madness pep festivities in the re-opening of the facility in October. Former NBA veterans Lionel Hollins, Danny Ferry, and Grant Hill have also stopped by this season, among numerous other acquaintances of Coach Amaker.
In addition, Lavietes Pavilion has continued to function as a practice host site to visiting NCAA and NBA teams. Duke and the Philadelphia 76ers, for example, held closed-door practices in the Crimson’s facility when playing Boston College and the Celtics.
Besides offering a unique sunlight-open space for practicing, Lavietes Pavilion also features completely revamped locker rooms, a new film control room for video operations, a new film room, and coaches’ offices. When walking into the building, fans are greeted by a team store and various photo plaques commemorating former Harvard Basketball alumni.
Among the alumni who were responsible for funding for this project and the basketball program as a whole include Thomas G. Stemberg ’71, former Staples co-founder and longtime basketball supporter. Additionally, a donation of $1 million by Jeremy Lin ’10 was partially dedicated for the Lavietes renovation alongside undergraduate financial aid support.
“While we are all grateful for Jeremy’s support of the renovation and program, there were a large number of named and anonymous donors who supported the renovation,” Carrabino wrote. “Many of them are named on a plaque inside Lavietes. Significant capital was raised specifically in honor of Tom Stemberg, the original Chairman of the Friends of Harvard Basketball…. The fundraising for the renovation was a true team effort.”
...
Outside of the glitz and glamour that comes with the renovation, Harvard Basketball will still be measured by its on-court performance. On that note, both men’s and women’s basketball have given home supporters a tremendous deal to be pleased about this season.
Harvard women’s basketball went an undefeated 12-0 at home, including victories against top-seeded Princeton and Penn. The men’s lone defeat at home this season was Jan. 2 against Vermont, as it maintained an unbeaten streak at Lavietes Pavilion in conference play.
“We have such great crowds,” said sophomore point guard Katie Benzan after an 87-85 victory against Brown on Jan. 29. “Everyone’s coming and cheering, and the environment is just amazing.”
“Having the fans, just the crowd in the background, the home gym vibe,” added junior wing Corey Johnson after the Crimson win against Princeton on Feb. 9, in which teammate Christian Juzang scored a career-high 20 points. “We don’t like to lose at home and whenever somebody comes here we are always ready to play.”
This successful play at home may paradoxically have unintended consequences. Top-tier programs, as Amaker noted at the start of the season, may be intimidated to travel to play the Crimson on its home court. Without the financial leverage to “purchase” bids to host these teams, Harvard men’s and women’s teams could lose out on opportunities in its non-conference schedule. Although team strength is certainly a more relevant concern, such an impeccable home record may raise red flags for big programs in its non-conference scheduling.
Another factor that may affect hopes at hosting larger competitions: seating capacity. The current renovated Lavietes Pavilion has downsized from around 2,050 to 1,636 seats in order to facilitate the inclusion of new amenities, such as cushioned seating in the upper rows. The renovated Lavietes Pavilion, with the smallest seating capacity in the Ivy League, now seats 464 fewer people than the next smallest Ancient Eight basketball facility, Dartmouth’s Leede Arena.

With the newly cemented Ivy League Tournament raising discussions about future host sites, the decision to downsize may significantly impact the odds of hosting this tournament on Harvard’s campus. The postseason tournament in its first two years of conception have been played inside the hallowed halls of the Palestra, which seats a maximum of 8,722 people. With the conference final between Harvard and Penn this past season filling around 5,500 seats, it would seem highly unlikely for Lavietes Pavilion to be able to fulfill attendance demand. This was one significant downside, according to Delaney-Smith, of the renovation proposal.
“The one consideration that was negative, was when talking about the Ivy Tournament, the capacity they want facilities to have in order to be a host school,” Delaney-Smith said. “I would say we fall short, and that is upsetting. I don’t know what [is] the right capacity we need to have.”
Whether such questions about the future viability of Lavietes Pavilion continue to be raised will still nevertheless rest in the performance of the basketball teams. Having sold out 10 combined games in the past two seasons and seeing ticket prices rise to $30 for marquee games, interest in the men’s and women’s teams from a supporter and donor side remain strong. For now, members of the community, coaches, administrators, and players are all enthusiastic about the present as the renovated Lavietes Pavilion enters its second year.
“Being able to see it a couple years ago and walk in the gym for the first time makes you appreciate the fact that we have a new facility, a new locker room,” said senior captain Chris Egi. “Also, just appreciating that we are the reason that it’s been built. There’s a lot of people that contributed in terms of alumni and players who were here before and built the program into what it’s been. It just gives a little perspective of what we’ve done and where we want to go.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Harvard men’s lightweight coach Billy Boyce took the helm at Newell Boathouse two years ago, he expressed his excitement at the prospect of coaching the team, which under previous head coach Michiel Bartman had finished sixth at the IRA national championships in 2016.
“I am thrilled to make my return to lightweight rowing and in particular, the chance to work with Harvard varsity lightweights," said Boyce in an interview with GoCrimson.com. "This is a special league and I look forward to starting the season and building a championship-caliber team.”
Boyce has done just that, cultivating and developing a strong lightweight crew team that for a significant portion of the season sat atop the rankings. Now, the men’s lightweight crew looks to the IRA National Championships at Mercer Lake, N.J., from June 1-3, where it captured the overall team points title last year.
Prior to coaching the lightweight crew, Boyce spent five years as a coach for the heavyweight crew team. In his final year, he led the second boat to a national title. Junior David Wexner said that Boyce’s experience with the heavyweight team helped to enhance his work with the lightweight crew.
“I think when he first came over, he did a really great job talking it out with a few of the older guys on the lightweight team, talking to a few of the guys on the heavyweight team as well and seeing what was different between the programs and why and how to bring them together to continue the good stuff that the lightweight program was doing and to start adding a bit more of what was working with the heavyweights as well,” Wexner said. “I think good communication has really been great.”
Before Harvard, Boyce coached for Ancient Eight rival Yale for two years. Boyce has his own taste for gold. At Cornell, Boyce was a three-year letterwinner and was named a first-team All-Ivy rower in 2008. As a rower in the sixth seat for Cornell’s lightweight eight, Boyce contributed to the boat’s first place finish at Eastern Sprints and the IRA National Championship.
“I think he understands what it takes in the lightweight league to produce really fast boats having been part of that,” Wexner said. “So he’s the right man for the job to show us how to do that as well.”
Senior captain Andre Dupuis said that Boyce’s experience demonstrates his knowledge about the technicalities of the sport.
“He has a lot of experience working with the heavyweights and working under these legendary coaches and has amassed a lot of knowledge on the sport and on the mechanics of the stroke,” Dupuis said. “I think it’s been really fantastic how’s he brought that knowledge and mixed in his own experience, so for us, over the course of my four years, I’ve seen a lot of change in how HVL is run, how we examine our rowing, and I think Billy has brought a nice, really easy to follow perspective.”
The coach has brought that same competitive spirit to Harvard lightweight, which swept through eight consecutive wins, taking down formidable opponents such as Cornell, Penn, and Columbia, before falling to Yale and Princeton on April 28. After a fourth-place finish at Eastern Sprints, in which the team fell to both Columbia and Penn, the crew looks to rebound in the IRA National Championships.
For assistant coach Ian Accomando, Boyce’s competitive spirit is what drives the lightweight crew team towards a national title.
“They key off of Coach’s Boyce’s competitive spirit,” Accomando said. “There’s no exception this year that we were very competitive internally so we could be as competitive as possible against Yale, against Princeton, and against the rest of the league.”
For Sean Hayes, who sat fourth seat in the first varsity eight at the Eastern Sprints Championships, Boyce’s strengths as a coach were made very clear on a recruiting trip in the fall of 2016. The Greenwich, Conn., native remembers sitting with his future coach on the launch and discussing Boyce’s plan for the upcoming season, which would be his first as head coach.
“When I was on my official visits during the recruiting process, I vividly remember sitting on the launch with Billy and him just laying out this whole, incredibly detailed description of the system that he planned on implementing right off the bat his first season,” Hayes said.
This plan involved implementing a ladder to rank the rowers in order to foster a healthy sense of both competition and camaraderie within Newell Boathouse.
“Hearing this so matter of factly from him and how confident he was in what he was saying, there was not a doubt in my mind that everything that he said would be manifested in the team, and obviously that showed that year,” Hayes said.
After a fourth-place finish at Eastern Sprints, the lightweight crew looks to mix up the lineups, which Wexner said displays Boyce’s ability to adapt to different circumstances.
“What I think what’s helpful throughout the season is he’s receptive to what’s going on, tracking things day to day and race to race and trying to keep on building, so in these few weeks especially, we’re mixing up the training more than ever, so trying to get some new stuff going, and trying not to stagnate really,” Wexner said.
For Boyce’s crew, that plan has truly manifested itself into a successful crew team which looks to capture that heavily sought-after title on Mercer Lake in early June.

“Why did you do that? ‘I was thinking the tree and the bike came out and the car almost hit me.’ What? Why did you do that?”
I’ll be honest and say I don’t quite remember the context, but it’s with this semblance of an analogy that Kentucky coach John Calipari addressed the room following a 79-70 win over Harvard this past December. It’s a quote that would never make it into a story on the game, mostly because I don’t think anyone in the room actually knew what he was trying to say.
But given the little pedestal I’ve been granted for these last words, I figured I’d share it for the record.
Over the past four years at The Crimson, this is how I’ve come to see this labor of love that is sportswriting—as recordkeeping. It’s telling everything that isn’t in the box score or in hundred word recaps. It’s keeping a record the little things—bits such as coach Calipari’s struggle to put thoughts to words or an alley-oop pass that actually turned out to be a three in a pretty important basketball game.
It’s realizing that fifty years from now, the only semblance of a narrative for an insignificant basketball game might be the words I put to paper at 14p.
But I won’t dramatize the work I’ve done—it’s far from glamorous. Sitting in freezing rain and driving to Ithaca on the weekends isn’t how most envision college after all. And that doesn’t even begin to tell the story. There are coaches who enjoy saying something is off the record about a couple sentences after they’ve said something and to the surprise of many, there are few gas stations in western Massachusetts.
Sportswriting—particularly at a school and publication where sports are often in the background—is really keeping a record of what would otherwise go forgotten. It’s composing a narrative that says ‘I was there’ regardless of how unimportant it was to be there. Really it has been a labor of fitting in little details, such as the chants of “Let’s Play Football” after the Harvard men’s basketball team ended Yale’s two years without a loss in New Haven. It’s making a note of the unfortunate fact that two years ago a women’s basketball home game had more Princeton fans in the stands than Harvard. After all, the box score only says what attendance was, not who they were rooting for.
Time will pass and I’ll probably forget most of these little bits, but I’m happy to say I had the chance to put most of it in writing.
With these last words, then, I mostly just want to leave a record of the little bits and pieces and memories that have made my days in and outside the halls of the Crimson so particular.
I’ll begin with an admission. To the freshmen I oversaw as comp director—it’s important you should know Henry Elkins Widener and John W. Weeks were never members of the sports board. I lied.
With that out of the way, I’ll be honest and say I’m struggling to find what the most salient bits and pieces were. If I were to go back to that trip to Kentucky, I have a lasting image of two nearly seven-foot tall basketball players attempting to fit into the economy seats of a flight. It was the first time in my life I felt okay about never reaching a size that would have allowed me to pursue a career in basketball.
I’d also remiss if I didn’t make a mention the Columbia Marching Band one last time. For the past two years this jubilant ensemble has made the trip to New York well worth it. From your wildly inappropriate chants to referees all the way to my discovery of your constitution, you’ve made me appreciate what a terrible band can do for a school.
To the Ithaca Police Department—I’ll forever be grateful for the two tickets you never gave me and my co-writer for speeding twice in the same day. For the past two years I’ve done nothing but bash on your fair city but really it’s just Cornell that’s holding you back.
To Ryan Fitzpatrick—I’m sorry I yelled “where the hell is Ryan Fitzpatrick” while standing right behind you after being told you were in Lavietes Pavilion. It was inappropriate and it made both of us uncomfortable.
To ABBA—myself and the entirety of the sports board are forever in your debt. Dancing Queen has taken cultish dimensions among our membership and we wouldn’t have it any other way.
To the design executive who once “might’ve” saved the sports page in the “wrong folder,” leading me on a two-hour search for it—I still haven’t forgiven you.
To the members of the sports board who struggled with deadlines, keeping me in the building for what was often much more than two hours—I forgive you.
For the record, and as with most things I’ve done for this publication, this is coming in well past the deadline. My apologies and my genuinely sincerest thank you.
By the time I entered college, I knew I wanted to accomplish three tasks that I believed would ease my transition into college life: to begin working on my concentration requirements for Applied Math; to find and women’s group that would be just as supportive as the women I had grown up with in high school had been; and to find a way to continue to be involved in sports.
The first two were easily accomplished in the first week. I enrolled in AM21a, the introductory Applied Math course, and found a few women’s groups I was interested in at the Activities Fair.
The last task, though, took longer. After initially taking an interest in club soccer, I realized that my course load and other extracurricular activities that I had already signed up for would make it difficult to be as active of a member of the team as I wished. I considered intramurals, but those conflicted with other club meetings and office hours.
I couldn’t believe that sports, which had been an integral part of my life since I was four years old, would no longer be a part of my life.
That is, until Sam Lin emailed me about a week after the Activities Fair, asking if I wanted to comp the Crimson Sports board.
“This would be a good way to still be involved with sports,” I remember thinking to myself, as my schedule did not leave much time to devote to the club soccer team. After a brief, in-person meeting with Sam, I decided to join.
When I walked into my first sports staff and compers meeting, I was welcomed with a booming “Ooh! Another comper!!” from Cordelia and a softer, “Welcome to the Crimson, Katherine!” from Juliet, the co-chairs of the sports board that year.
I was comforted by the sight of a woman-led board with several other female staff members in what had a reputation as a predominantly male board. After four years at an all-girls’ high school, I valued having other women around me, especially those who knew the ropes and would be able to give advice.
The women of the sports board taught me how to write Crimson-style articles as I covered women’s and men’s crew and women’s and men’s squash for my first two years on the board. They made sure I felt comfortable adding new ideas and writing about sports that I was relatively unfamiliar with, and made sure that the board valued anything and everything I had to offer.
With their encouragement and advice, I was prepared for hard-to-reach players, the awkwardness of interviewing after a hard loss, and the excitement of covering a championship win.
Nothing, though, prepared me for what would happen my junior fall during my first season as a men’s soccer beat writer.
It was a regular weeknight, and I had taken a break from homework to start writing a preview for the team’s upcoming game. Almost as soon as I picked up my phone to begin calling players, my co-beat writer and then-chair of the board, Julio, texted me to not call the players.
At first, I thought that I had confused the schedule of who would cover which game, but Julio called to say that the season’s remaining games had been canceled due to an uncovered scouting report.
I couldn’t believe it. How could a sport that is generally inclusive seem to alienate and degrade women? How could the players, who were always so kind and loved to joke, make such a document? As a woman, how could I continue to write about the men’s team?
In deciding to stay with the beat, I knew most of these questions would never be answered. Due to coverage last year, I knew that it would be more difficult to contact the players who distrusted the Crimson, but I did not know how difficult that would be.
Not one player responded when I reached out for comments on the team’s season opener. Despite my efforts, it appeared that the sport I loved was turning its back on me and that was because I was a woman (let alone a reporter from the Crimson).
With all of the women before me graduated, and as one of two senior women on the board, I knew it was I who had to lead by example this time for the younger women on the board. I kept  contacting the players, the SID, and the sports chairs until I had my interviews. Later that week, an agreement was made on the players’ responsiveness to my fellow beat writer, William, our compers, and me so that we could do our job.
Until that day, I had never taken notice of what it meant to be a female writer on the Sports Board. I had always felt comfortable with my place on the board—in the earlier years, with more women, and even in the later years with fewer because I became close with the guys in my comp class and in older years. Perhaps I took for granted the fact that I had a voice in that group, but perhaps it was the reason why I refused to be shut out by the soccer team.
After that and similar episodes, it is clear that work still needs to be done to make sports more inclusive. My time on the Sports Board has provided proof, albeit on a smaller scale, that it is possible for the industry to be inclusive and for women to play an active and meaningful role in it. As I leave Harvard and transition into the traditionally male-dominated world of finance, I will take all of the lessons learned from being a part of the Crimson and continue to be a presence and make my voice heard.
Last month, Justin Watson was drafted by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, capping a decorated Penn career in which the wide receiver left opposing defenses as trashed as Ithaca.
I know the date because I was playing close attention. You see, Justin Watson holds a special place in my memory. He fits into a larger pantheon of characters that I have encountered through the Sports Board. Gabby Thomas. Matt Koran. The Seventh Floor Crew. Bryan Hu ordering pizza. Spencer Morris playing “School Spirit.” Troy Boccelli playing the HPR. You get the point. In different ways, all stand above the drabness of daily experience. They are unique and colorful.
What is greatness? Why do we pursue it? How do we achieve it? I have watched enough Nike commercials starring Michael Jordan to know the expected answers. Greatness means objective triumph. We must pursue greatness constantly, for every moment offers an opportunity to excel. Hard work leads to nirvana.
Yet sports create an illusion of legibility. Real life doesn’t have four quarters. You can’t measure relationships with clear metrics or summarize experiences through the language of wins and losses. Greatness, for instance, means more than objective triumph. Each of us has a different form for which we strive. At the root of “distinction” is “distinct”: to be different, to stand apart. Sports—which subject everyone to the same rules and statistics—cannot contain greatness. True greatness means inventing the scale and then exceeding it.
At 14p, I have met some great people. Few would deny that Steve and Troy are weird dudes. And yet—here’s the paradox of greatness—they have furthered their eccentricities by connecting with others, specifically by forming the three-legged beast known as The Brain Trust. We discover ourselves in others. We gain by giving. Watching sports taught me to cherish greatness, but working for the Sports Board taught me what greatness really means. I leave with a greater determination to strengthen my own idiosyncrasies through community: to be distinct with others.
I don’t know what makes Gina Kennedy so good. I don’t know the rules of sailing. What I do know is that the Sports Board has given me moments of inexplicable contentment. I remember hawking commencement newspapers with Cade last year, rain pooling in our shoes but us still yelling that attendees should grab an issue to read about The Florence Flash and, besides, so many pages of wet paper would make a fine seat cushion. I remember sitting with Jack in the Arctic tundra of Franklin Field, sustained only by a cold chicken tender and the vague dream of a warm hotel room in Camden, N.J. I couldn’t feel my toes, but I did feel a mysterious happiness. I cherish the Sports Board for these memories—moments in which I had no right to feel joy, but I felt it all the same.
Thank you to everyone who enabled my joy. Thank you to the 142 and 143, who introduced me to such cherished traditions as Dizzy Bat and Playing Civil War until the PBR Runs Out. Thank you to the freshmen, sophomores, and juniors who now bear the burden of carrying on these traditions. Thank you to my fellow members of the 144, especially those two members of The Brain Trust who survived a weekend trip to Kentucky.
I wish that I could end with a pithy epitaph, but as editors know, I sometimes struggle with concision. (To those editors: Just be glad that this piece didn’t clock in at 6,500 words.) I turn instead to the wise words of a former writer: “The dog days aren’t over, and there’s something in the oats.” Only Justin Watson could say it better.
In March 2017, a sophomore from Harvard did something no other Ivy League sprinter had ever done—she advanced to the finals of an Indoor NCAA Championships race. In that eight-person 200-meter dash final, Gabby Thomas finished last.
Eighth place in the race meant she was the eighth fastest collegiate sprinter in the nation at that distance. But as has become typical for Thomas, doing what no other sprinter in the history of the division had done before still didn’t satisfy her.
“Last year I came in dead last in this final with a really bad race,” said Thomas in a 2018 interview. “So I spent all [this] year mentally preparing and focusing on the discipline.”
That preparation and focus returned Thomas to Texas A&M’s Gilliam Indoor Track Stadium for the NCAA Division I Indoor Championships in 2018 and again she made the finals in the 200-meter dash. The race was divided into two four-person sections, with Thomas running in the second section.
In section one, San Diego State’s Ashley Henderson ran the race in 22.41 seconds, one-hundredth of a second faster than the 2017 champion and slower than collegiate record by the same metric. The collegiate record, set by Bianca Knight of the University of Texas, had stood for a decade. Knight later went on to win gold at the 2012 London Olympic Games as a member of the US 4x100-meter relay team.

“I was thinking ‘I'm going to have to break a collegiate record if I want to win this race,’” Thomas said. “At that point all I could was take a risk and focus on my own race plan.”
So that’s what she did.
In a race that featured personal bests from two other competitors, Thomas placed first with a collegiate record, meet record, facility record, and personal best 22.38-second finish, ending Knight’s decade-long reign atop the collegiate record boards.
With the gold, Thomas became the fourth Harvard woman to stand atop the national podium and the first female sprinter to accomplish the feat. In addition, as a result of her national title, Thomas became the first in program and Ancient Eight history to earn USTFCCCA First Team All-America honors two years in a row.
At the national meet, Thomas competed in more than just the 200-meter dash. After breaking both the Harvard and Ancient Eight record in the event at the Indoor Ivy League Heptagonal Championships two weeks prior to the meet, Thomas placed 12th in the race at the national stage. Finishing .01 seconds from her best, she earned USTFCCCA Second Team All-America honors.

Thomas has since been named to The Bowerman Post-Indoor Watchlist. A list of 10 student-athletes, The Bowerman is awarded annually to the top male and female athletes in nation. In the group of 10, Thomas was one of four athletes from non-SEC schools. Her appearance on the watch list represented the first time a Harvard student has ever been recognized by the organization. Since being named to the Post-Indoor Watchlist, Thomas has not left the top 10, being named also to the Mid-Outdoor, Pre-Conference Championships and Post-Conference Championship Watchlists.
Thomas’ consistency among the top rankings comes as the junior repeated a dominant performance at the Outdoor Ivy League Heptagonal Championships.
Traveling to Penn’s Historic Franklin Field, Thomas went a perfect five-for-five, claiming golds in every event she competed in, a feat she achieved at last year’s conference meet as well. This season, the gold rained in long jump, the 100-meter, 200-meter, 4x100-meter relay, and 4x400-meter relay. In the 200-meter, Thomas set a meet record.
The most astounding part of the meet wasn’t so much the Florence, Mass., native’s domination in the track events as it was her domination in a single event, the 4x400-meter relay. In a finish that garnered national attention, Thomas was handed the baton with a 2.8-second deficit to make up. Starting in fourth place, the indoor national champion immediately jumped into second place.
Thomas still had about 30 meters to make up between her and Columbia’ Akua Obeng-Akrofi, a 2016 Olympian for Ghana and the nation’s representative at the IAAF World Outdoor Championships and the Commonwealth Games.
“Down 2.8 seconds—all I was thinking about was catching her,” Thomas said. “I didn’t know how many meters away she was, especially seeing as Penn’s track is configured differently than most, so it was just strategy of catching her and securing the win in the 4x4. That’s all I could think about when I was running.”
And Thomas caught her. Making up the distance on the final stretch, Thomas leaned forward at the finish line and crossed just .04 seconds before her Columbia competition.
It wasn’t even that Obeng-Akrofi had run a particularly slow lap. Rather, Thomas’s 400-meter dash was extraordinarily fast. With a 49.44-second split, Thomas’s time was over two seconds faster than the meet record in the solo 400-meter dash, a race Thomas didn’t even compete in. Brown, the third place finisher in the relay, didn’t finish until nearly four seconds later.
Thomas ultimately earned Most Outstanding Track Performer of the Meet for the second consecutive season. She also shared the Most Outstanding Field Performer of the Meet award with teammate sophomore Simi Fajemisin and Penn’s Ashley Anumba.
As a result of Thomas’s performance at the meet, the sprinter was named a USTFCCCA National Athlete of the Week, the first time the honor has been earned by a Harvard athlete since Courtney Smith did the same in 2016.

In this season alone, Thomas has broken several records. In the indoor 300-meter dash, Thomas set the school record and the BU facility record. In the indoor 60-meter, Thomas set the Ivy record, tied the New England record, broked how own personal record and the conference record again. Then at Ivy Heps, Thomas set the school, division, and meet records times again. The indoor 200-meter dash told a similar story. Thomas first set a facility and meet record at the Texas Tech Shootout before setting the collegiate record at NCAAs, breaking personal, division, and school records en route. That was just indoor.
Not even done with the outdoor season, Thomas has set personal and Ivy records in the 200-meter dash while securing the fastest collegiate time in the nation for the season up to that point with her finish at the Hurricane Alumni Invite. She then proceeded to set a meet record at Heps in the same event, not to mention a program record in long jump.
This barely begins to take into consideration the records Thomas had already set. Without 2018 accounted for, Thomas’s name is beside the program’s top finish ever in nine events, and among the top seven in five more.
With outdoor season yet to conclude, Thomas still has time to win another national championship. The last two season’s Thomas has placed third in the national championship race. Last season she did it with a time of 22.61 seconds.
But Thomas is more than just the fastest collegiate sprinter in the nation; the neurobiology concentrator serves as a leader on the team. A co-captain in the 2018 season, Thomas was just this month named co-captain for the 2019 season as well.
“Gabby is an inspirational teammate because she always gives it her all and pushes herself and all of us to do more than we thought we could,” teammate Zoe Hughes said. “Seeing her do so well at the finals was great, and we’re all really proud of her.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Mention Jing’s name to anyone who knows her and they will literally start beaming. She has this effect on everyone who has the pleasure of meeting her. Maybe it’s her contagious smile? Or her ability to laugh so genuinely? It probably has something to do with the fact that she will listen so intently to anything you’re saying whether it’s serious or meaningless—if it’s important to you, it’s important to her.
Jing, with all her laughter and compassion, has been one of the greatest additions to the Harvard women’s swimming and diving team (HWSD). She has selflessly dedicated time and energy to this team, offering support to anyone feeling overwhelmed and advice to those of us who needed it (even when we didn’t know that we did). Early on Saturday mornings, before the majority of the student body was awake, Jing would bounce into practice with a contagious energy that inspired all of us, swimmers and divers alike, to follow her lead in challenging ourselves with a productive practice. It’s one thing to be up and active…. It’s another thing to be smashing out your 3m list at 7am—trust me. As a freshman, Jing entered as one of the top divers on the team. She always, however, strived to become stronger, to jump higher and enter cleaner into the water (if that is even possible).
And when it comes to Jing’s performance—well her achievements speak for themselves. She finished in the final for every event, at every Ivy League championship meet and was awarded the lifetime highest scoring diver. This is all as a springboard diver, something she hesitated to label herself as, since in high school she dove platform (the 10m high concrete board). The transition to springboard in college was challenging but Jing’s diligence and determination made it possible. And despite the fact that Harvard does not have a 10m high platform, Jing defied expectations and competed at NCAAs every year of her college career in the platform event, which she qualified for after practicing her list two to three times that year. And if that weren’t impressive enough, she finished her sophomore year placing eighth in the country, ironically becoming a true All American. But beyond the awards, and the medals, and the achievements, Jing was the most graceful diver to watch. She was so intentional with every single aspect of each dive and managed to finish them with such finesse—it has been a joy to watch her dive for the past four (or more like six) years.

And more important than her ability to dive, Jing has contributed to this team most by dedicating her heart and soul to it. I think back to the nervous and unsure freshman that she was and I have to laugh. Over the course of four years Jing has become an integral part of HWSD, as demonstrated by her being elected as co-captain her senior year. No matter what she was dealing with in her own life, she was always present at the pool and ready to give all she had to practice. She was the loudest cheerer and the most selfless competitor, making sure her teammates were comfortable and ready before preparing herself - she taught us all how to be better teammates to each other. There will always be a special space in the heart of HWSD for Jing—we will never forget how much she gave to us and how different we all are for having known her.
I don’t know if there is anyone with quite the same style of humor as Jing or someone with such a keen insight into the wonders of life (think cucumbers and dominoes), but I do know that everyone should be so lucky as to have someone like Jing on their side. It has been such an honor to be your teammate Jing and I am so grateful that I got to navigate the American way of life with you by my side. Thank you for everything that you ever gave to this team and don’t forget us as you go out into the real world and save the planet. And wherever you end up, whatever you find yourself doing, we will always be there, cheering you on.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Week 7, October 28, 2017—Harvard vs. Dartmouth—two minutes left on the clock. Everyone is gassed. The game has been back and forth with Dartmouth down three attempting to put together one last drive to win the game. I look over at Tanner Lee, who is equally gassed, and he nods his head, as if to say, “It’s time to make a play and win this game.” Unsurprisingly, that next play Tanner picks off the quarterback and we hold on to win by three. Big time players make big time plays, and that was Tanner’s MO. This is Tanner now, but let’s look at how he got here.
Tanner is from a small town in Alabama named Daphne. He has always been overlooked. He was small in high school, and most of college. As one of the latest recruits to get offered in the ’18 class, Tanner felt he did not get enough attention from coaches. Tanner’s freshman year only added to people doubting him. His first collegiate drive ended with a ball sailing through his hands and into the other teams receiver’s hands for a 70-yard touchdown. Doubt from everyone grew. That is exactly why Tanner had such a successful career. People doubted his abilities, but he never did. Tanner worked harder than everyone because he had a chip on his shoulder to prove people wrong. He was tired of being overlooked and counted out, so he changed his narrative. Tanner had an unbelievable career because he put in the time in the film room, weight room, and practice field. You do not become great overnight, and Tanner is the perfect testament to that.
To be surrounded by the nation’s most admirable 18-23 year olds and stand out head and shoulders above most speaks to Tanner’s willingness to outwork everyone else. Football is arguably the most demanding sport on campus. It requires 40-plus hours a week of on-the-field training, film study, physical therapy, lifting weights—oh, and more film study. On top of all of this training, Tanner still had enough energy and grit to be an excellent student. Excellent student is not an exaggeration. He is an Academic All-American while taking applied math classes, which, by the way, is not the easiest major.
Most athletes cannot work 80-100 hours a week during the summer, find time for mentoring younger players, and train for the upcoming season,  But that is exactly what Tanner Lee did last summer. Not only did he excel at his internship role at JP Morgan (earning a return offer), but he also managed to train for the upcoming season, which resulted in an All-Ivy selection and team MVP performance. Because training and working were not enough to have on his plate, Tanner spent numerous hours working with younger guys on the team to ensure they were well-prepared for their upcoming job applications and then interviews.

Tanner’s consistency on and off the field is his most admirable trait. You know what you are going to get from Tanner every day. Whether you are having an off day at practice because it has been a long week, or you have a math problem set due the next day and it is midnight, if you ask for help, there will be no hesitation from Tanner. He constantly wants to help everyone around him, and he consistently brings his best to everything he does.
Tanner Lee—All-Conference football player, All-American academic, and All-(fill in the blank). Clearly he is a talented guy, but the things that don’t show up on the stat sheet or the report cards—his character, work ethic, leadership, ability to motivate, love, sense of humor—are the things that make him an unbelievable man, teammate, and friend.
Thank you Tanner for showing me how to outwork everyone, how to be consistent, and how to be a great friend. Love you.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With just 1.8 seconds remaining in the first quarter of the Ivy League Men’s Basketball Tournament semifinal at the Palestra, the Crimson held possession of the ball at its own baseline. Sophomore forward Robert Baker hurled a football pass over to classmate Chris Lewis, who, with his back facing the basket, snatched the ball over Cornell junior Jack Gordon’s outstretched arms and tossed the ball over to its final recipient. Standing at the “Y” of the midcourt IVY logo, 40 feet away from the basket with milliseconds left on the clock, sophomore guard Christian Juzang calmly swished in the buzzer-beater.
This staggering sequence of plays certainly involved a certain degree of luck. But for the Harvard men’s basketball team and Juzang especially, past preparation came into play even for rare situations like this one.

“Me and my teammate Corey Johnson try a couple of those in after practice everyday,” Juzang said. “Lewis had an amazing catch, Baker had a long throw to kind of put me in position, and then a little bit of God, a little bit of practice, and then it went in.”
This play epitomized the ready-at-all-times mentality that has propelled Juzang into a leading role on coach Tommy Amaker’s roster this season. Starting his second year as the backup point guard behind classmate Bryce Aiken, Juzang was placed in the spotlight during Ivy play after a knee injury sidelined Aiken for much of the latter half of the season.
With little remaining depth at the point guard position, Amaker entrusted Juzang to take over floor general duties on the sophomore-heavy team.The point guard had seen little action prior to early December, averaging only ten minutes of playing time per game over the first nine games of the season.
However, with the team struggling to shoot consistently and piling up losses to Northeastern, Holy Cross, Cal State Fullerton, among other opponents, Amaker recognized a need to switch up his rotation. Against Fordham on Dec. 6, Amaker gave Juzang his first night with double-digit minutes, with the exclusion of the MIT exhibition. Although he had a quiet night, the guard saw gradual increases both to his minutes and offensive production as Aiken could no longer suit up beginning on Dec. 21 against BU.
Then, in the Crimson’s first Ivy League contest against Dartmouth, Juzang recorded his first double-digit scoring performance of the season with 12 points in 35 minutes of game action. As the team began to gain momentum entering conference play, Juzang’s role continued to expand. In wins against Princeton, Penn, and Brown in mid-February, the point guard played in 119 out of 120 possible minutes with 14 made field goals and 11 assists in that span.
“I think [Juzang] has been playing tremendous basketball,” said Amaker after the Crimson’s win over Yale on Feb. 17. “Really proud of how he’s been able to come in and take the reigns of the team as our quarterback, still have an aggressive mindset, and also be really savvy and smart about when to pick his spots.”
Juzang’s breakout game came on Feb. 9 against Princeton. With leading contributors Towns and Lewis mired in foul trouble, the Crimson turned to its point guard to generate offense. Juzang delivered a team-high 13 points in the first half, before adding two more baskets and three free throws for a new career-high 20 points. Harvard carried a double-digit halftime lead to the buzzer and knocked off last year’s Ivy champion, 66-51.
“Coach always talks about letting the game come to us,” Juzang said post-game. “Shots were just there to take. Just trying to make the play whenever I can, and credit to my teammates and coaching staff for that.”
The point guard would eclipse that performance with a 21-point, four-triple outing against Brown followed by a March 10 Cornell victory in which he tallied 20 points and four assists. A consistent presence at the charity stripe, Juzang would finish the season shooting over 88 percent from the line to go with a 40.9 percent clip from the field.
Juzang’s tenacity on the defensive end has earned him recognition among teammates as well. Throughout the season, Juzang was typically the first player to initiate a mark-up on an opposing guard, applying pressure on opponents before they even crossed half-court. Although he earned just 14 total steals on the season, this conscious effort at defending earlier in the possession helped the team lock in and stabilize its overall presence.
“The big thing for us is stopping the ball in transition,” said junior Corey Johnson after the Feb.17 Yale win. “That’s one thing Juzang does exceptionally well. He did a great job of just corralling the ball handlers so that they don’t get open and start finding guys, shooters with open looks. So that was a big thing for us, finding the shooters, getting back on defense and playing a full team defense all over the court.”
Juzang’s guidance at the lead guard role ultimately contributed to a strong Ivy season for the Crimson, which finished 12-2 in conference play to win its first Ivy League championship since 2015. Prior to the Ivy League tournament, Amaker noted Juzang’s performance as a significant reason for Harvard’s late season success.
“[Juzang]’s play has been very inspiring for the rest of the team,” Amaker said. “I thought his play on the ball defensively was the catalyst for us to get a lot better.… I think rhythm, I think leadership, I think the play of Juzang, I think all those elements really propelled us to really turn this ship around.”
The SoCal native will return to Cambridge with reinforcements, as fellow Californian and ESPN 4-star point guard Spencer Freedman headlines the incoming 2018 recruits for Amaker. Bryce Aiken, who Amaker stated was the team’s best player at the start of the 2017 season, will also figure to re-take a prominent role once he fully recovers from his knee injury.
This soon-to-be crowded backcourt will certainly alleviate expectations for Juzang to play all 40 minutes every game. Nevertheless, as competition continues to grow in the Ivies and with new talent bountiful, success will likely depend on a repeated mantra of Amaker’s “bench and balance.”
Juzang’s efforts in taking over for a star player this year put into action this importance of depth and readiness on a college basketball roster. It also showed that, even if just for one play, it doesn’t hurt to shoot threes from Curry range during practice.

The first time Morgan Cheek and Robert Shaw shared a lacrosse field—in the spring of 2011—both had yet to decide what sports they would be pursuing in the long run. Both were still playing ice hockey at a high level, and Cheek also roamed the soccer pitch during the warmer months.
Fortunately for the Harvard men’s lacrosse program, both decided that lacrosse would be the sport they would pursue in college.
That matchup in 2011—between Cheek’s club team, the Laxachusetts Minutemen, and Shaw’s club team, the Top Gun Fighting Clams—would mark the first of many times that the two shared the same field, in competition and out of it. They would meet again several times playing for their club teams over the subsequent years, and with each student-athlete also attending school in the Greater Boston area—Cheek at Noble and Greenough and Shaw at Roxbury Latin—they would face off while playing for their respective schools as well.
Flash forward seven years from that first encounter, and Cheek and Shaw have now made 40 starts together for the Crimson. Both broke out in their sophomore years, and have since become the backbone of a team that has collected 21 wins in three years, including one in the Ivy League Tournament. Individually, they have found success that few other players at their positions have had with the storied program.
Cheek, an attackman, ended his career with an even 200 points, tallying 105 goals and 95 assists across 54 total games played. With these numbers, Cheek etches himself into the program record books by finishing within top five in goals scored, goals assisted, and points recorded. The senior also slots in at sixth in single-season points, with a 67 point haul in 2017.
On the other side of the field, Shaw became only the sixth Crimson goalie ever to reach the 500-save milestone, finishing with 504 saves. He is the first goalie to reach that mark since Keith Cynar, who graduated almost 20 years ago in 2000.
“It’s been an honor to coach Morgan and Rob,” said Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96. “The two guys who work as hard as anyone I’ve coached over the years, and it obviously showed on the field. It’s rare to find two guys who are as steady, as consistent as they are, and we’ll no doubt miss them next year.”
While it is not hard to guess that Cheek and Shaw have shared the field in every single competitive match for the Crimson since the start of their sophomore seasons, much fewer might realize the amount of time they shared on a field in the summers before that.
With Cheek growing up in Wellesley, Mass., and Shaw residing just 15 miles away in nearby Canton, it was only natural that the two would start practicing with each other.
“Morgan and I have known each other for a long time, and after a mutual friend connected us back in our junior year of high school, we started practicing with each other,” Shaw said. “It was perfect. He would shoot on me and work on his moves, and I worked on my technique at the same time. We were both at a similar level of play so it was always a good back and forth between us.”

When the duo started playing at Harvard, their extra training sessions together became even more frequent. After both players’ freshman seasons ended, Cheek and Shaw stayed on campus over the summer to take part in the “Summer Dogs” program, in which players from the lacrosse, football, and hockey teams, among others, work on conditioning and their respective games.
“Rob and myself both were not that satisfied with our freshman year, and we knew we could play at a higher level,” Cheek said. “That summer, he would get in goal and I would shoot on him every day for about two hours after we worked out. Then we did the same thing again the next summer. We just put a lot of work in together.”
Towards the end of that first summer, there was one moment when Cheek noticed how significant the improvements that he and Shaw made. A professional Major League Lacrosse goalie had joined their workout that day, and after shooting on both him and Shaw, Cheek was struck by what he noticed.
“To be able to shoot really well on a pro goalie, and then for Rob to match his play in the goal, just having that barometer present was pretty cool,” Cheek said. “And we’ve never really talked about it, but I think it was at that point that we both knew that we could be pretty good. We’d both come a long way that summer.”
And come a long way their certainly did. Both players earned starting spots early in their sophomore seasons, and Shaw would go on to rack up 181 saves that year, while Cheek went from scoring seven goals during his first season to 36 during his second.
For Cheek, who played box lacrosse after high school and was one of the top high school players in the nation his senior year, the improvement was a natural progression. For Shaw however, who joined the team as a preferred walk-on and sat through freshman year as the de facto fourth string goalie, the jump impressed his coaches immensely.
“Rob came in here and nothing was handed to him,” Wojcik said. “We preach on this team that everyone earns their spot, and no one took that to heart like Rob. He made strides every offseason and carved out a role on this team when really nothing was guaranteed.”
Shaw views his rise in a similar light.
“When I came in there was a senior captain goalie, and of course I didn’t expect to play freshman year because he was the senior captain,” Shaw remembered. “But he was actually beaten out by a junior at the time, and I saw for myself that whoever was playing the best was going to be the one who was getting playing time. It was definitely a meritocracy and seeing that definitely drove me.”
At the end of the day, both players are thankful for their individual success but wish it had translated to greater team success. During their four years with the program, Harvard went an even .500 with a 28-28 record. The team did make it to the final of the Ivy League Tournament in 2016, but that was the closest it ever came to an NCAA berth.
“For me, it’s kind of like a weird feeling,” Cheek said. “I definitely wish that some of my goals and points had translated to more team success, and there is no doubt in my mind I would trade these records and awards for just some more wins.”
Nevertheless, in their senior seasons, Cheek and Shaw helped the Crimson secure its first winning record since 2014.
And while their names will be etched in the program record books for decades to come, Cheek and Shaw also leave behind clear imprints on the underclassmen in the program, who can look to their work as a model for taking the team to greater heights.

Two words can describe sophomore Miki Dahlke’s performance this year for the Harvard women’s swimming and diving team: domination and camaraderie.
Despite breaking multiple Blodgett Pool records and competing at the NCAA Championships for the second straight season, Dahlke has embodied a true team-oriented mentality that fuels both her own performance and that of her teammates.
During this year’s Ivy League Championships, Dahlke remembers the immense energy that her teammates provided her.
“Your teammates high-fiving you...you walk and you’re down below the stands and you look up, and all the family and friends and teammates cheering you on, and that brought a rush of adrenaline to me,” Dahlke said. “I’m doing it for them and I wasn’t thinking about the time.”

For head coach Stephanie Morawski ’92, Dahlke’s year-long success was attributable to an impeccable work ethic.
“Of course we were very excited for Miki, but as a coach, I’m very process-oriented, so I was not as surprised maybe as others because I watch what Miki does on a daily basis,” Morawski said. “It’s not just that she challenges herself in the pool and in the weight room and pushes herself against her teammates every day, but it’s also that she does the little things right.”
These little things included eating and sleeping well, doing exercises for loose shoulders, which Morawski said helps distinguish “between someone being good and someone going on to be great.”
The Mill Valley, Calif., native’s success started right at the onset of the season. In the first dual meet of the season against Columbia, Dahlke finished first in the 200-yard freestyle. The next weekend, she took the 50-yard freestyle and the 100-yard butterfly and also anchored the group winning the 200-yard medley relay.
The top finishes kept on piling up, but Dahlke and the rest of her team had their eyes set on the Ivy League Championships at the end of the season. And that is where the sophomore truly shined.
In the second event of the meet, the 800-yard freestyle, Dahlke—along with Kennidy Quist, Geordie Enoch, and Meagan Popp—finished in a blazing time of 7:05.06, taking a meet record in the process. As always, Dahlke’s focus on community came through.
“Relays are one of my favorite parts of swimming because it’s the part where you can really see why swimming is not just an individual sport, it’s also a team sport because you’re coming together,” Dahlke said. “Even though you’re all swimming your own individual part, each person contributes in order to make a winning relay.”
Popp said that Dahlke’s focus on her team was admirable and displayed a level of maturity in the sophomore. It also didn’t hurt that she split a 1:45.00 in her first leg.
“It was really comforting for her to go first because she is such a strong force in that event, and having the lead that she did after the first leg I think was a confidence boost to the rest of us to keep the lead going and hold on until the end,” Popp said.
For tri-captain Kristina Li, Dahlke also made immediate positive first impressions.
“Right when she joined the team, she meshed really well with the team, and she’s a great athlete and a great teammate,” Li said. “Obviously, she trains really hard and has a great work ethic in the pool, but outside the pool, she’s got this really fun, silly personality.”
Li also noted that Dahlke’s performance in the pool helped to inspire the rest of the team as well.
“Obviously, Miki’s accomplishments are really great for her from an individual perspective, but it was really great for us as a team because we really ride off of each other’s energy and each other’s swims,” Li said. “When our team sees individuals perform and do really well, it fires everyone else up and keeps the momentum going.”
One of those inspiring moments came on the third day of the Ivy Championships, when Dahlke competed in both the 100-yard butterfly and 200-yard freestyle events.
“Freshman year we did not want her to do it because I didn’t know what she was capable of,” Morawski said. “I didn’t know her as well yet, and this past year at Texas, she did swim both, and looked up at myself and Coach Amanda and said, ‘I think that I can do it at Ivies,’ and we agreed. We knew it was going to be tough, and again, it was her team that carried her through.”
She crushed them both.
Dahlke broke the Blodgett Pool record in the 100-yard butterfly in 51.89 and then preceded to break the pool record in the 200-yard freestyle in 1:45.38. However, for Dahlke, her favorite moment of the race was not her own victory but the second place finish of fellow teammate Quist, who outtouched the third place finisher by one one-hundredth of a second.
“That was part of my favorite race of the meet I was a part of not because of what I did but because afterwards, seeing that Kennidy beat the defending champion by one-one hundredth and got second and had a crazy last 50 when she was behind by a body length,” Dahlke said.
Not done breaking records, Dahlke tied the meet record and broke the pool record in the 100-yard freestyle in 48.64 on the final day of competition. She was named the High Point Swimmer of the meet and helped Harvard capture its third Ivy League title in five years.
Dahlke said that she looks forward to the strong incoming freshman class and her teammates to compete with her at NCAAs. Coach Morawski recognized the greater leadership role the sophomore will provide in the future, especially in mentoring the younger incoming swimmers.
“Honestly they’re only going to reach their level if they follow Miki’s lead because freshman year can be challenging with the transitions, but if they do have someone who they respect, who goes that extra mile and mentors them, I think it can make a big difference in our entire team,” Morawski said.

No-hitters are cherished for the rare combination of skill, grit, and nerves of steel required to pull them off.
With a strikeout to end the game against Yale on April 13, Harvard senior right-handed pitcher Noah Zavolas completed a no-no in what he dubbed “one of the biggest games [he’s] ever pitched.”
In front of the 327 in attendance at Yale Field in West Haven, Conn., Zavolas tossed a masterful no-hit performance, striking out 12 and facing just two batters above the minimum in a 4-0 win against the league-leading Bulldogs.
“Really, really special night, especially being able to go out there on a Friday night against our rival,” Zavolas said. “To be able to play under the lights was beautiful in a setting like Yale. Just an incredible night all around.”
The Acton, Mass., native brought a perfect game into the eighth inning, setting down the first 23 Yale batters in a row before surrendering his first base runner on an error with two outs in the eighth.
Zavolas finished strong, however, striking out the side in the ninth to put an emphatic exclamation point on his performance. His final line: 9.0 IP, no hits, no runs, and one walk.
Zavolas was dominant from the start.
“By the fourth or fifth inning, I knew I was coming up on twice through the order with no one reaching base,” Zavolas said. “[The possibility of a no-hitter] kind of started to creep up on me. Truthfully, my two starts prior, I had had a little bit of a shaky first inning, so just to get through that first in a 1-2-3 manner was new and refreshing for me, so I knew things were looking up immediately. But I would say fifth or sixth inning, you realize something’s brewing.”
The Crimson offense staked its ace to an early 3-0 lead after posting three runs on five hits in the second. The fact that the game was neither scoreless nor a blowout did a lot for Zavolas’s rhythm—he wasn’t in the dugout for too long between innings, nor did he have the stress of a scoreless game on his shoulders.
“It’s always nice to pitch with the lead,” Zavolas said. “It allows you to pitch a little bit more relaxed, and be more aggressive, especially early in the count with batters. To some extent, it was also really nice that it was still a close game. It was almost a perfect storm, because we were winning, but it wasn’t a blowout, so every pitch still very much mattered. And the innings went by quickly, so it was a great rhythm to it as well; it wasn’t like I was sitting on the bench for 15-20 minutes.”
In the bottom of the eighth inning, Harvard’s nerves were put to the test.
A ground ball to a diving junior first baseman Pat McColl was mishandled by Zavolas, giving the Bulldogs their first baserunner. Though the perfect game was broken up, the no-hitter was still in play, albeit on a tightrope.
 “It was unfortunate, and in the moment, it kind of dawned on me what was happening,” Zavolas said. “The game was still very close, with a runner on first, so it was good that there were two outs at the point, and I just had to focus in for one more hitter and get that out. In some sense, it was fortuitous that it was me who made the error—if someone had to make the error, I would much prefer that it was me.”
If it rattled Zavolas, he didn’t show it.
“I think it rattled us [behind him], more than anything,” McColl said. “It didn’t really faze him too much, he seemed not too worried about it.”
The veteran starter got a groundout to end the inning and worked around a ninth-inning walk to shut the door on Yale.
“Everyone was pretty locked in on defense,” said McColl of the last two innings. “It can be a little nerve-wracking when you’re out there in the ninth inning. Just talking to some other guys, you want the ball hit at you, but you’re also kind of freaking out a little bit because you know you’ve got to make a play if it comes to you.”
When the moment of the final out finally came, the whole team was there to celebrate.
“For me, I threw the pitch and then the ball skittered away from the catcher, so it was a little bit of a delayed reaction,” Zavolas said. “Completely surreal to have the team come storming out of the dugout.”

Zavolas didn’t no-hit any average opponent, either. Yale was the best team in the Ivy League all year long, finishing atop the regular-season standings with a 15-6 conference record. He also couldn’t have picked a better night to throw the gem on—his parents were in attendance.
“It was special because both my parents were there, and my host family from this past summer was there, too,” Zavolas said. “Walking over to my folks afterwards and locking eyes with my dad, having that look pass in between us…having no idea how what just happened, happened, was pretty wild. Really just a perfect night, with the right people in the right place at the right time. Everything came together.”
Junior catcher Jake Allen navigated the game behind the plate with Zavolas, framing pitches, blocking balls in the dirt, and providing the final putout at first base to close the game.
“I firmly believe that the relationship between the pitcher and catcher is incredibly important, and most of that just boils down to trust,” Zavolas said. “We had been paired up a couple weeks prior, so it was nice to have consistency behind the plate. To have him back there, he was a very calming presence. Jake did a great job all night, and it looked like we were in sync from the first pitch.”
The no-hitter solidified Zavolas as the ace of a burgeoning Crimson squad that sorely needed front-end pitching stability. The game lowered his ERA at the time to 3.38, though his season-ending ERA dipped even lower, ultimately settling in at 2.96.
Zavolas ended up leading the team with a 6-1 record and 70.0 innings pitched on the year, striking out 77 and posting a 9.90 K/9.
The no-no was Harvard’s first in 17 years, when former Crimson standout Ben Crockett—now in the Red Sox front office—did it against Dartmouth in the 2001 season finale.
As of April 30, 2018, college pitchers this season had thrown 22 no-hitters, less than 0.4% of games of around 7000 Div I NCAA regular-season games—a tiny proportion. Even so, this year was college baseball’s “Year of the Pitcher”—2018 is set to shatter the previous single-season record of 19 no-nos, set back in 1973.

Despite coming up just short against Princeton in the Ivy League Championship, Harvard women’s golf enjoyed an individual conference title thanks to junior Michelle Xie. The Palo Alto, Calif., native roared past her competition to finish out the tournament atop the leaderboard.
The junior’s contributions helped the Crimson stay in contention heading into the final round of the tournament. However, when Harvard and Princeton were knotted up at the end of the tournament’s final round, the Crimson ultimately fell just short of the Tigers on a playoff hole.
“It was a very interesting week,” senior captain Lita Guo said. “The chances of having a playoff and ending with a tie are rare.”
Although the season ended in heartbreaking fashion, Xie served as a bright spot in the final competition of the year. The Crimson junior finished day one tied for fourth after posting a five over par score of 77, helping bring Harvard to second place after the first round.
On the second day, Xie shot an impressive 71, good for one under par to launch her to the top of the individual leaderboard. Xie was the only golfer able to post a single round score under par at the Metedeconk National Golf Club in Jackson, N.J. Xie followed up her tournament-best 71 with another stellar performance in the final round, recording an even par 72 to secure her place as the top finisher on the weekend.
Winning is nothing new for the Harvard phenom. Though Xie did not record any individual victories during her freshman year, she helped lead Harvard to a conference championship by placing third with a cumulative score of 228. She also earned first-team All-Ivy League honors.
Xie exploded onto the scene in her sophomore season, notching a trio of individual victories at the Princeton Invitational, the Harvard Invitational, and the Navy Spring Invitational. Although by all measures Xie had a successful season, she faltered in the second round of the Ancient Eight championship, posting an 85 and eventually finishing 12th in the field. This left unfinished business for Xie in the final competition of her junior season.
After finishing tied for seventh in the Harvard Invitational, the last tournament before the Ivy League Championships, Xie zeroed in for the final contest of the season.
Xie’s modest first day of the tournament resulted in 13 pars and 5 bogeys on a day when no competitor finished below par. The following round, however, Xie turned on the gas by balancing three bogeys with an impressive four birdies to finish one under par.
Sitting in first headed into the final day, Xie protected her lead with ease. Xie birdied two and bogeyed two holes, finishing the day at even par and the tournament at four over par.
Although the rest of the leaderboard remained cluttered behind Xie, the Harvard junior finished comfortably ahead of her competition. The next closest finisher, Princeton freshman Anabelle Chang, finished a full four strokes back at eight over par.
Xie’s finish in the tournament helped her to achieve All-Ivy first-team honors for the second time in her career, joining fellow Crimson golfer and Ancient Eight co-Rookie of the Year Belinda Hu.
Besides Hu and Xie, Harvard will return six of its seven players for the 2018-2019 campaign.
“We have four freshmen joining us next year and they are all amazing players,” junior Anna Zhou said. “I’m looking forward to it.”
Harvard will look to capitalize on its youth and gained experience from this past season to reclaim the Ivy League title. Xie, with her counterpart Zhou, will serve as all-important senior mentors to a young team hoping to avenge this season’s tragic loss. Next season, Xie will look to lead the Crimson while defending her individual Ancient Eight title.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the 2017-2018 academic year, some 1200 student-athletes joined forces under the unmistakable “H” and represented Harvard Athletics on one of its NCAA-leading 42 Division-I teams. Scarcely any competitor, however, made a greater impact on the university or his respective sport than former men’s ice hockey standout Ryan Donato.
This season, the forward skated on the collegiate, Olympic, and National Hockey League stages. Donato did not seem to care whether he was sporting the crimson, the stars and stripes, or the black and gold “B”—he excelled at all levels of hockey and did so with his typical unassuming demeanor.
“There’s a lot of different things going on with the Olympics and with [the] Boston [Bruins],” said Donato toward the end of his wild Harvard season. “But for me, being able to focus on the games ahead, and just that, allows me to play to my best potential.”
At Harvard, the Scituate, Mass., native enjoyed a stellar junior campaign, posting 43 points (26–17—43) in 29 contests and earning a laundry list of accolades including AHCA First Team All-American, ECAC Hockey Player of the Year, and First Team All-Ivy. Even more importantly, Donato was named a finalist for the 2018 Hobey Baker Memorial Award, given to college hockey’s top player. He is just the eighth skater in program history to be considered in the top three for the prestigious honor.
At the conclusion of the 2017-2018 season, the sniper led the nation in goals per game (0.90) and outpaced his fellow ECAC skaters in conference points per game (0.89). Donato’s hot start to the year undoubtedly helped him achieve these marks: he kicked off the season with a career-best 14-game point streak (14–8—22) and was the first Division-I player to eclipse the 20-goal plateau, requiring only 19 games to do so.
In February, the centerman paused his collegiate obligations to represent Team USA in the Pyeongchang Winter Olympic Games. Donato shined for the red, white, and blue, ending the tournament tied for the lead in goals (five) and among the top 10 in points (six).
“Just having that opportunity at that stage was just a great opportunity for me to capture and kind of show everybody else on the world stage—obviously, it’s the biggest stage in sports—that I could play,” said Donato, reflecting on his once-in-a-lifetime Olympic experience.
According to the Americans’ head coach, Tony Granato, roughly 100 players were considered for the 2018 Olympic roster, and most of the spots went to overseas professionals and minor league players in North America. Donato was one of just four NCAA skaters to be selected for competition in South Korea.
“Ryan was always one at the top of the list,” said Granato upon returning to the States after the Olympics. “He had a tremendous start [to the season], and he was a guy that we thought would continue to develop and grow and had a great chance for a breakout season to become an elite college player. And he lived up to that.”
USA Hockey was more than pleased with its decision to add the Harvard centerman to the stars and stripes. In Pyeongchang, Donato injected his squad with speed and creativity, pacing the team in scoring and becoming somewhat of a household name in a matter of weeks.
"He fit and played the role exactly the way we had hoped he would,” Granato lauded. “He probably in some ways surpassed what we thought he could do at the Olympics...playing against some of the best players in the world on the big stage.”
During his Olympic stint, Donato’s uncanny goal-scoring ability was on full display for a wider audience than the usual Harvard fan base. But the Crimson faithful was already well aware of Donato’s elite skill set. After all, the ex-Harvard star averaged 20 goals per season during his college tenure, playing alongside some of the program’s most talented forwards in recent years. In short, the local fan base was happy to have him back.
“Obviously, I’m excited to be back,” Donato said after returning from Pyeongchang. “It was a lot of fun there, but now that that’s over, my focus is all on this team, and they deserve it.”
The Dexter School product also potted five hat tricks for the Crimson, with three of them coming in this past campaign. The last goal trio of Donato’s career came with his team’s season on the line in a decisive ECAC quarterfinal game.
The game-three contest marked the final time Ryan Donato would skate at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center—and find twine—for his alma mater. Appropriately sentimental for the occasion, Donato’s first tally that evening thrust him into Harvard’s 100-point club, as the centerman finished with 104 points (60­–44—104) in 97 games after three collegiate seasons. Donato is the 32nd player in program history to achieve the milestone.
“On Saturday and Sunday, [Donato] elevated his game, and that helped elevate our team,” said Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 of Ryan’s play in the Dartmouth series. “Those are our best players, and important games need your best players to be the best players.”
The victory over Dartmouth, which sent the squad back to Lake Placid’s ECAC semifinals for the fourth straight season, also proved to be Donato’s last triumph playing for his school. Harvard’s season ended five days later in heartbreaking fashion to Clarkson.
At that point, Donato finally had to confront the life-changing decision that had been looming in the backdrop of his junior season since the very first fall practice. Would he follow the footsteps of past Crimson stars and return for his senior season, or would the opportunity to play professional hockey simply be too prime to pass up?
Ultimately, Donato decided to fulfill his lifelong dream of playing in the NHL and announced his plans to leave the Harvard program two days after Clarkson ended the Crimson’s season.
Luckily, the Boston Bruins owned the forward’s rights after selecting him 56th overall in the 2014 NHL Entry Draft. The Bruins would return to TD Garden after a series of road games on Monday, Mar. 19—a perfect opportunity for Donato to debut at home and the main impetus for his quick departure announcement. A Boston debut also allowed for friends, family, and teammates to easily attend the contest and celebrate Donato’s promising young hockey career alongside a roaring hometown crowd.
“We went to go watch the Bruins game,” said rising senior forward and next year’s co-captain Michael Floodstrand of Donato’s debut. “Coach Donato had a box, we all went…. [Ryan] had an unbelievable debut. I was standing the whole time. It was awesome.”
Following the Sunday-evening press release announcing his NHL future, Donato had an exhilarating next 24 hours. He promptly joined the Bruins for a morning skate on Monday before suiting up that night against the Columbus Blue Jackets.
“It was a quick turnaround,” said Donato of his decision process, taking a sigh of relief that a whirlwind day was finally over. “I’ve had to call so many people and talk to so many people that it’s honestly insane.”
A new, grander stage. The same unfazed Donato. This seemed to be the theme of Ryan Donato’s 2017-2018 season.
The Harvard product lit the lamp and tacked on two assists for an extraordinary three-point debut. The performance certainly impressed Bruins coach Bruce Cassidy, as he expressed his excitement for having Donato on board after the game.
“I liked him a lot,” coach Cassidy said. “He just played his game…. Very impressed by that, to be able to come in here, especially in your hometown.”
In just one day, Donato had gone from the Crimson’s offensive keystone to a piece of the puzzle on a NHL team looking to make a deep playoff run.
And yet, after his exciting first day as a Boston Bruin, Donato effectively returned to the life he was living prior to inking a professional contract. To the extent that the Bruins’ schedule allowed it, he planned to spend nights in Harvard’s Winthrop House and keep up with his coursework. Even the little details—those that truly define a Harvard student—seemed to not miss a beat.
“[After the debut] I came back here, and I was doing work,” Floodstrand recalled fondly. “All of a sudden, he walks in and he’s like, ‘Yo, what’s up?’ And I’m like, ‘What are you doing here?’.... It was crazy: we went to Jefe’s, and it was like, ‘This guy just played for the Bruins.’”
Nothing says staying true to your roots more than a late-night run to Harvard Square staple El Jefe’s Taqueria after a casual three-point NHL debut. Clearly, you can take Ryan Donato out of Harvard, but you can’t take the Harvard out of Ryan Donato.
Nobody knows this better than Ryan’s father and current Crimson coach, Ted. Coach Donato, a 13-year NHL veteran in his own right, has always had an impactful relationship with Ryan around the sport of hockey.
“When we’re at the rink, or at the arena, we were coach and player,” said coach Donato in early April, regarding his hockey relationship with Ryan over the years. “It was an interesting dynamic, and regardless of who you talk to, it’s hard to really gameplan for it. But I thought Ryan did a great job handling it, and I like to think that ultimately it was good for everybody involved.”
The 2017-2018 campaign, however, presented a unique dynamic in the Donato father-son experience. Ryan’s Olympic and NHL journeys gave Ted plenty of reasons to be proud of his son, as well as ample opportunities to advise him as he began to navigate the next steps of his hockey career.
“It’s very exciting, and even watching him at the Olympic Games was a little bit different experience than it is being behind the bench,” noted coach Donato, when asked about what this year meant to his relationship with Ryan. “As a coach, you’re always happy when your players go onto have success, but in Ryan’s case, obviously, there’s another level of connection. It’s hard to put it into words.”
Ted’s father-coach balancing act was among the most fascinating elements of Ryan Donato’s 2017-2018 season. In these nine months, the former Harvard standout took the NCAA by storm, dazzling with his scoring ability and leading by example on a young Crimson squad. He seized a rare opportunity to skate in the Olympics after the NHL barred its players from participating, and he excelled there as well.
Then, after a Hobey-finalist year in college, Donato made the jump to the NHL, where he held his own with nine points (5–4—9) in 12 regular season games. On top of all the on-ice accomplishments, Donato impressed both teammates and fans with his authentic and humble character.
“He’s one of those hockey players that’s just fascinated by everything going on,” reflected coach Granato of his interactions with Donato before and during the Olympics. “He just loves the game so much…. I love the kid. He’s a coachable kid. Obviously, he’s going to have a tremendous career in front of him.”
You would be hard-pressed to find another Harvard athlete who shined on so many levels in 2017-2018. And the best part is: his hockey career has just taken off.
So for those of you who missed the spectacle of Ryan Donato, Harvard centerpiece, you can always see Ryan Donato, Bruins winger, instead. TD Garden is only a short T ride from Harvard Square.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Leadership is an all-important quality in college basketball, often as important as the play on the court. Senior leadership is not something eyed in recruiting in high school; this intangible skill develops itself.
For graduating Harvard women’s basketball guard Taylor Rooks, however, the road to her senior year did not follow the typical path. The journey in her college career may have had its ups and downs, but it resulted in the Crimson leader finishing her playing days as an irreplaceable facet of the Harvard team.
The first deviation from the norm was that her career did not in fact start in Massachusetts; it began in Palo Alto, Calif. Initially, Rooks committed to Stanford University to continue her education and basketball career after high school. The Warren, N.J., native played 28 minutes in 12 games with the Cardinal, averaging 0.8 points and 0.6 rebounds. Rooks decided to transfer to Harvard before sophomore year.
“Transferring in and sitting out a season was definitely a lot,” Rooks said. “Within the first month of getting here, I developed a blood clot in my leg, which was terrible. I wasn’t able to work out for a month, I was completely sedentary for the most part. It really took me back a couple steps.”
Her sophomore season saw no playing time due to NCAA transfer rules, and a larger chunk of her adjustment period was used recovering from injury, further slowing the process. Rehabbing and watching her new team from the bench proved a difficult challenge for the then-sophomore.
“It definitely wasn’t the easiest way to come in, and from sophomore year on it was a bit rough in that regard,” Rooks said. “I wanted to be on the court, and contributing to my team. Then again, it was a blessing in disguise that I was forced to sit out because I was injured.”
Heading into her junior year, Rooks was finally ready to start her playing career with the Crimson. Rooks started her assimilation with the team coming off the bench but quickly made an impact for Harvard, seeing action in all 30 games her junior season. After sitting out an entire season, this transition did not come without its challenges.
“I was trying to figure out my role on the team last season, get my basketball skills back up to high school level and freshman year of college after missing time,” Rooks said.
Although Rooks excelled, tallying seven double-digit scoring performances off of the bench, she still had more development to go leading into her final season. In the first game of the 2017-2018 campaign, Rooks showed what she could bring to the table with a 13 point, 13 rebound double-double in a loss to Dayton. Rooks would continue to prove her leadership on the court heading into the conference season. In the first Ivy game of 2018, a 63-56 loss to Dartmouth, Rooks scored a then-career-high 23 points and grabbed 11 rebounds to keep the Crimson in the game.

“Taylor was very consistent, she was very poised, I didn’t even get to rest her,” Delaney-Smith explained after the contest.
The leadership continued throughout the rest of the conference season. Only a few weeks later, Rooks netted 24 points for a new career best in a thrilling home victory over Brown.
“This past season, I finally felt like I was playing again,” Rooks said.
In her final campaign, Rooks finished with 12.5 points and 7.3 rebounds per game, earning a second-team All-Ivy League nod at the conclusion of the season.
“Looking back at it, I wish things had gone differently at times,” Rooks said, “But it was a great year to finish.”
Although the pathway was unconventional, Rooks completed her Harvard career in exceptional fashion. Her unorthodox route may have been trying, but it resulted in a comeback story capped off with an exceptional senior year that would make an outside observer oblivious to the fact that there was a comeback to be had.
“I am very thankful for having played at Harvard, and I’m extremely grateful for the opportunity to have been an athlete here,” Rooks said.

Immediately following the injury, senior utility player Harry Tafur could not bar the pessimistic thoughts from flooding his mind.
“I thought I was going to get surgery,” Tafur said. “It was pretty bad because you could see my clavicle popping out, so I said, ‘Well there goes my senior season.’”
The 2017 season statistics do not tell the tale of the injury, rehab, or readjustment that Tafur experienced, but the ones close to him know the dedication and determination that delivered a successful season for the senior.
Tafur’s injury came from the most unlikely of sources: a simple bike ride on a bright summer’s day.
“I was riding down a hill and hit a pothole,” Tafur said. “I flipped over the front tires and landed on my left arm and I separated my AC joint…tore the three ligaments that connect my clavicle to my shoulder. Luckily enough, my phone still had some battery and a car drove by right as I took my tumble, so they called an ambulance.”
The doctors diagnosed him with a third degree AC joint separation. The same shoulder that Tafur used to propel him through the water, grab opponents, and fend off defenders was rendered motionless only four weeks from the start of the season.
“I was told I would have a good six weeks in a sling and a lot of rehab,“ Tafur said. “I couldn’t really make any movements. I had to rebuild a lot of the tiny muscles surrounding the joint just because my ligaments were snapped so they were never going to heal, and surgery was not an option.”
While the injury was surely gruesome, the physical damage may not have even been the most painful part of the crash. Tafur had many hours of rehab ahead of him. Almost every day during the summer before the 2017 season, Tafur rehabbed for hours, working on simple movements to get his shoulder back into playing condition.
“Getting blood flow into the area was the first priority,” Tafur said. “Eventually, after a couple weeks I was swimming, and just progressed more and more.”
In the midst of disappointment, a couple of silver linings rose to light surrounding the entire situation. First, the injury occured over the summer on campus, which allowed Tafur direct access to Harvard facilities to accelerate the rehab process. Second, the injury could have been much worse than it turned out to be.
“Luckily I didn’t need the surgery,” Tafur said. “I guess a lot of NHL players have it so it's not a [terrible] injury…. I think Harvard has resources that not every school has. I was able to be in the training room at 5 a.m. and [the trainers] were already in there. The pool was open to us at all times, so in the afternoon I could go there after work and get a little motion in my arm. I think the biggest thing is the facilities and the resources they provided. The athletic trainers and the weight coaches were able to create a new program for me...keeping me in shape.”
A combination of successes allowed Tafur to start in the first game of his senior season as co-captain of the team, returning back to the pool multiple weeks before his expected return date.
“I say this lovingly, obviously, but the kid is a freak of nature,” coach Ted Minnis said. “The kid hurt his shoulder pretty bad, and he’s in doing swim sets three weeks later. He just powered through, and that's just a testament to who he is.”
Tafur’s presence was felt right away. On the opening day of the season, facing off against Pepperdine in the Bruno Classic, the senior notched three assists. Though the Crimson ended up falling to the Waves, 16-7, Tafur was thrilled to get back in the water.
“I think getting in the pool for the first game was good,” Tafur said. “Getting over the hump and knowing I could play a full game, not necessarily to my best performance, but I was still able to do it.”
Being back in the water did not mean a return to perfect health for Tafur. He played limited minutes for the team to begin the season, and there were mental and physical barriers along the way.
“I think definitely I was a little hesitant to use my left arm,” Tafur said. “This is a very physical sport, and I was hesitant to push or grab because I didn't want to tweak it again. I could tell my left side wasn’t as strong as my right side, but just like any injury, you bounce back pretty quickly. The more you play the more you build confidence.”
Tafur continued to make waves past the first game for Harvard. The senior finished the 2017 season with 58 assists, by far the team leader in that category. The co-captain also helped lead Harvard to its second straight NEWPC tournament title and a quarterfinal appearance in the NCAA tournament. He and fellow co-captain Colin Chiapello became the winningest class in Harvard men’s water polo history with 94 victories.
“It meant the world to me,” said Tafur when asked the importance of coming back for the 2017 season. “We were looking to repeat our championship run. We knew the conference championship final was going to be at Harvard and it was something we wanted to be in the finals for. Being able to be a part of the journey…was an awesome feeling.”
Tafur made his mark beyond the pool this season. The co-captain was a leader and an example for the younger players on the team.
“[Chiapello and Tafur] are going to leave a big hole when they leave,” Minnis said. “Obviously Harry [Tafur] had some big moments in his career here and I’m very proud of being able to be a part of his growth here at Harvard.”
Tafur was not deterred by injury or adversity this season and ended his Crimson water polo career with an exclamation point. He hopes the teams that follow will continue to do the same.
“It's been amazing four years,” Tafur said. “Kids now know what it means to win. The biggest thing…is that we left the program in better shape than when we got here. That’s just the best feeling to know that things are on the up and up moving forward.”

They say 3-1 is the most dangerous lead in hockey.
After 40 minutes of play, the Crimson was sitting pretty in Lake Placid, N.Y., up 3-1 in its ECAC semifinal against No. 10/8 Clarkson. So far, it seemed like Harvard had ticked off every point on the checklist. The team had withstood the Golden Knights’ early push and struck twice on the power play, all the while with tri-captain Merrick Madsen between the pipes to fend off Clarkson’s offense.
A solid third period would take the Crimson back to the ECAC final, where one year before it had stormed its way unbeaten to the Whitelaw Cup. Now, in a possible cup defense, the squad would face an upstart Princeton team that had fallen in both its matchups against Harvard this season. The Crimson, which had dropped out of the PairWise in November and hadn’t been back in the rankings since, would need an ECAC title to proceed to the NCAA tournament. But first, the team would have to survive the final 20 minutes of hockey.
In late February as the regular season closed, Harvard had clinched a top-four seed in the ECAC playoffs—coincidentally, after a decisive 5-2 win against the Golden Knights. But a disappointing winless finale against Brown and Yale in the following weeks meant the Crimson sat at No. 4 in the seeding. The team had a bye week to recover from those losses while it awaited its first playoff opponent.
“Getting home ice and a bye is not easy in our league,” said head coach Ted Donato ’91 after the season had concluded. “I thought our guys did a real good job [getting there].”

The bye week wasn’t just a chance to catch a breath. Harvard had gained momentum in its mid-February tilts before grinding to a halt against the Bears and the Bulldogs, and would need to find its stride again if it hoped for a deep playoff run. While the offense needed its own retooling, the Crimson also needed to face the question it had been asking throughout the ups and downs of its season: who would backstop the team in net?
The obvious answer was tri-captain Merrick Madsen. The senior had helped power Harvard to the Frozen Four a year before, and would leave an indelible mark on the Crimson’s record books upon graduation. His numbers on the season (20 GP, .923 SV%, 2.18 GAA) weren’t too shabby either. Once Harvard knew it would face Dartmouth, Madsen’s experience counted even more in his favor—in the Crimson’s season sweep of the Big Green, Madsen had posted a stingy .978 save percentage and allowed only one goal.
But the stats concealed some of Madsen’s less impressive showings, such as a raucous 6-6 tie at Clarkson in January (.800 SV%, 6.12 GAA), and the coaching staff would not commit to any one particular net-minder. In its six February matchups, Harvard had seen all three goaltenders—Madsen, junior Michael Lackey, and sophomore Cam Gornet—start contests.
“We want a chance to win every night” was all coach Donato would say ahead of ECAC play against Dartmouth.
Despite coach Donato’s reticence and a Game 1 loss to the Big Green, Madsen held onto his place in net, recovering to post two strong showings as the Crimson moved onto Lake Placid. Late in the semifinal game against the Golden Knights, the squad and fans hoped that he would withstand any punches Clarkson threw his way.
At the other end of the ice, despite the score, the Golden Knights were not in as desperate a situation as Harvard. They had stayed in the rankings since a 15-game undefeated streak had catapulted them as high as No. 2, and so could still earn an NCAA berth with an at-large bid. That did not mean Clarkson was sitting back. The teams had traded momentum swings; the difference thus far was that the Crimson managed to capitalize on its opportunities and the Golden Knights could not.
Where Harvard had perhaps been most effective all season against Clarkson was in shutting down the North Country school’s formidable all-sophomore forward line. Sheldon Rempal (22–21—43), Devin Brosseau (10–21—31), and Nico Sturm (14–22—36) brought speed and dynamic offense to any matchup, but the trio had combined for zero even-strength goals against the Crimson.
Harvard would hope to keep it that way for just 20 more minutes. Its stars had already made their presence felt: junior forward Lewis Zerter-Gossage and rookie offensive-minded defenseman Reilly Walsh had found the net on the player advantage, and sophomore forward Ty Pelton-Byce had added the third tally on an assist from junior standout Ryan Donato. Either way, it seemed as though the next goal would blow the game wide open.

After the second intermission, the teams lined up for the faceoff at center to open the third period. Donato squared off against Golden Knights captain Nic Pierog for the draw, which Pierog won back to senior defender Kelly Summers at his own blue line. Summers drifted back as he corralled the puck, trying to avoid Pelton-Byce’s forecheck. Perhaps due to wet ice, the puck slipped from Summers’s stick, and was there for the taking.
Pelton-Byce scooped it away from the reaching Summers, streaking down the middle and backhanding the biscuit over the shoulder of Clarkson sophomore net-minder Jake Kielly. Just like that, Harvard was up 4-1 and celebrating. Only six seconds had passed in the final frame.
Another Pierog faceoff win prompted a Crimson line change. The same Clarkson players remained on the ice, as if determined to get one back for the tally they’d just conceded. Summers carried the puck into Harvard’s zone, and his shot went into Madsen’s pads and trickled into the high slot. Amidst the chaos around the net, sophomore forward Haralds Egle sent a drive towards the cage that Pierog deflected past Madsen, silencing the cheers of Crimson fans.
Though the Golden Knights’ answering punch still had Harvard up by two goals, something had changed in the fifteen seconds since intermission. The Crimson had wavered.
On January 19, Harvard visited then-No. 2/3 Clarkson, days before students flooded Cambridge again for the start of the spring semester. The Crimson hadn’t matched up well against ranked opponents thus far in the season, falling twice to No. 6 Minnesota and once to No. 12 Cornell, and tying No. 13 Boston College. To add to the challenge, the Golden Knights were then in the middle of their undefeated streak and hadn’t lost a game since late October.
Harvard, though, was riding its own stretch of fair play, having weathered three overtime games in its last four tilts to stay unbeaten in the new year. After his rocky start, Madsen seemed to have righted the ship, looking sharp in net even through extra hockey.
Fifty-nine seconds in, the Cheel Arena crowd was given a taste of what kind of game this would be, as Clarkson rookie forward Jack Jacome tallied early. Minutes later, junior Michael Floodstrand got one back for the Crimson, and the contest seemed to calm down—until a Donato power play goal allowed the visitors to take the lead in the second period. The teams traded leads at a frantic pace, and the dust settled for a 3-3 stalemate after the middle frame.

Sophomore forward Frédéric Gregoire broke the tie less than two minutes into the third for Harvard, and his notch was followed by an insurance tally from tri-captain Jake Horton. With the two-goal cushion in place, the Crimson prepared to close the game out. But the Golden Knights weren’t finished yet.
In the next eight minutes, Clarkson found the back of the net three times, chasing Madsen and beating Lackey twice to secure a 6-5 lead. Though Zerter-Gossage scored in the last minute of regulation to restore the tie and a scoreless overtime prevented the Golden Knights from stealing two points, the Herculean comeback effort was difficult to forget.
“Both teams can feel good about their perseverance,” said coach Donato in January. “I thought we kept coming and had a chance all the way down to the last second of overtime.”
Playoff hockey means a game cannot end in a tie, though. One of these teams would have to give way.
Clarkson’s quick response in the ECAC semifinal to bring the score to 4-2 certainly did not have Harvard running for the hills, but perhaps it reminded players of the January showdown, and how quickly the outcome of a contest could change when these two teams battled it out. Unfortunately for the Crimson, the Golden Knights began to recreate that very script.
30 seconds after Pierog’s goal, Harvard junior blue-liner Adam Baughman was whistled for tripping Rempal. Thus far, Clarkson had gone 1-for-5 on the power play, but an important strike here would go a long way in allowing the Golden Knights to take the game by the reins. Rempal kept the puck in the Crimson’s zone and circled the cage, with Sturm and Brosseau parked in front of the net. He fed Brosseau, whose top-corner snipe deflected off Madsen’s glove and in.

It only took a few more minutes for Clarkson to smell blood again, and on a similar play. Egle protected the puck down low, drawing attention to himself and away from senior forward Dylan Gareau, who was stationed right in front of Madsen. When the biscuit came to Gareau, he didn’t miss a beat, throwing it past the goaltender and tying the game. The Golden Knights crowd erupted. The work of the past two periods, it seemed, would come down to the last five minutes of regulation—or beyond.
Exactly a week before the semifinal, Harvard began its playoff run against Dartmouth, a team with a hot net-minder and a capable offense that belied its .500 record. Nevertheless, the Crimson had squelched both of these factors in its regular-season sweep of the Big Green, and entered the quarterfinal best-of-three series as the favorite.
Dartmouth threw expectations out the window, shocking Harvard and the Cambridge crowd for a 4-1 win. Pulling Madsen with over five minutes to go in regulation gave the Crimson its sole tally.
“We have to take a look in the mirror and say, ‘Hey, what kind of effort is it going to take for us to have success?’” said coach Donato after the loss.
If there was to be a turnaround for Harvard, it would have to be quick. The next day, the Crimson and the Big Green returned to Bright-Landry for Game 2 of the series. A loss meant the visitors would move on to the ECAC semifinals, and Harvard’s season would be over. With it would end the careers of one of the winningest senior classes in Crimson history. The seniors had been to Lake Placid every year so far with Harvard.
“After the Friday night loss to Dartmouth, I couldn’t really sleep that night,” said Horton after the series had been won. “The next morning, I woke up…probably the most dialed-in I have ever been for a hockey game in my life.”
That weekend, the Crimson regrouped for two straight wins and a series victory. The next week at Lake Placid, with overtime ahead, the seniors were once again staring at what could be the end of the line. The next goal could end the 2017-2018 season.
As the extra frame began, Harvard stuck to its game, holding onto possession and cycling the puck in the offensive zone. Floodstrand nearly beat Kielly with a wraparound less than a minute into play, forcing the net-minder to go post to post and keep the puck out. But after the initial surge, the teams reverted to caution, aware that one mistake would decide the game.
The tide turned, though, after a neutral-zone giveaway. Donato, the last player any opponent would want turn the puck over to, cleaned up the loose change and sped into the Clarkson zone. Though Kielly saved his shot, the Crimson had several more chances, and Baughman saw his drive ring off the post. For a long stretch, aside from an Egle breakaway, you could be forgiven for thinking the game was being played on only half of the Olympic-sized ice.

But the Golden Knights withstood Harvard’s pressure as the clock ticked past the halfway mark. On a rush, Brosseau carried the puck into the Crimson’s zone, finding Sturm’s tape. Sturm, flying down the right side, passed behind himself to Rempal, the trailer coming down the middle. And Rempal went top-shelf on Madsen, closing Harvard’s window of opportunity.
“The way it ended...it was almost like, ‘This didn’t happen. That’s not real,’” Horton said. “I remember sitting at the hotel after the game with my mom, and staring blankly, like, ‘how?’ That’s all I could keep saying to myself. Just, ‘how did that happen?’”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The road to success is a popular moniker to which teams of all sports and levels aim to follow. But the Harvard women’s squash team is not on this track. Instead, after winning its fourth consecutive National Championship, the team seems to be in a state of perpetual success.
When spectators entered the Murr Center on a chilly President’s Day Weekend this past February, they stepped into a premier institution for squash. Nearly every single year, the Crimson hosts the collegiate national championships for either men or women. A month after the top collegiate women’s teams competed for the Howe Cup, the U.S. Junior Championships were hosted at the Allston institution. It is the home of the 31-time national champions, Harvard men’s squash.
But among all the preeminence, one matter stood unclear: the identity of the most successful women’s team in collegiate squash. Going into the weekend, both No. 1 Harvard and No. 2 Princeton laid claim to 17 national championships. The Crimson came into the season as overwhelming favorites, losing just four individual matches the entire season and easily dispatching the Tigers earlier in the season with an 8-1 home victory.
Nonetheless, the weekend was scripted for the Crimson to challenge the Tigers in a duel for the throne. Princeton, led by longtime mainstay Gail Ramsay coaching in her 24th year, looked for one more opportunity to defend its long-established position at the top of women’s squash that began by winning 10 of the first 12 Howe Cups. Meanwhile, the Crimson looked to disrupt the status quo by further solidifying its recent upstart status into a long-term dynasty.
After dispatching both No. 8 Cornell in the first round and No. 5 Yale in the national semifinal, Harvard held its end of the narrative with ease. But in the other semifinal, Princeton faltered against No. 3 Trinity and eventually lost the match by a 3-6 score line. Much of the anticipated drama and symbolism faded away with this upset. Instead of a dramatic fight between the top two schools in women’s squash, the national championship came down to a NESCAC school attempting to nick the overwhelming favorite playing on its home court.
In the end, all the dramatic potential had already been siphoned away. The Crimson won in a 9-0 sweep—the first team to accomplish such a feat in the national championship game since the Bantams did so 15 years ago. It was a fitting end to a dominant season for the Crimson, and for the graduating seniors—one final sendoff. The win against Trinity marks the 53rd straight team match won by the Crimson, dating back to Jan. 11, 2015.
This culture of success within the last four years has an interesting implication: as the senior class of the Harvard women’s squash program graduates this week, the players on the team will collectively never be able to remember losing a squash match.
Captaining one of the smallest teams on campus has been one of smallest classes of players possible. Sue Ann Yong and Alyssa Mehta make up the entirety of the 2017-18 graduating class of Crimson women squash players. Playing at the No. 4 and No. 6 positions, respectively, this season, Mehta and Yong have not traditionally been the names to headline the Harvard women’s squash team. They constitute the last class that played alongside now-pro Amanda Sobhy ’15 and spent years lower on the ladder than the younger Sobhy sister Sabrina (named next year’s co-captain along with the younger Mehta sister Sophie) and individual national champion Gina Kennedy.
But despite the lesser name recognition, it is unfair to call them role players in any sense other than in their role to win—the two collectively went 27-1 during this past season. With each of the nine slots equally contributing toward a match victory, they have provided valuable depth that is a major reason for the continuing success of Crimson squash.
When there is a robust talent pipeline the mainstays of a program can be pushed to the backburners in favor of the new products. Mehta and Yong have experienced this in a sense, as both have moved down a position in the lineup since they were freshmen. But as co-captains and veterans they have found ways to contribute in new manners outside of headlining the team.
“Being captain, you are exposed to everything that the team does,” Yong said. “I think the past three years I wasn’t as involved, but just leading the team and the little things that make the whole team come together, I think being captain I have a huge role in making that happen.”
While the duo has found a new, expanded role within the team during this past year, they do so with the larger and collective team goal of maintaining the same excellence every single match, year after year.
Sitting at the top of national rankings naturally puts a target on your back. Underdogs look for upsets and revenge during top teams’ long periods of dominance. With a three-year undefeated streak and hungry opponents every single match, Harvard may have found some relief—or at least amusement—from its status as a technical underdog before its regular-season matchup against then-No. 1 Princeton this past year. As a situation that simply arose from a strength-of-schedule technicality, this occurrence serves to highlight the now-constant assumption that the Crimson is the best team in the nation.
Indeed, what followed was an 8-1 Harvard victory over Princeton in which the biggest surprise was not an upset at the team level, but rather Olivia Fiechter’s first win in dozens of matches against childhood rival Sabrina Sobhy. By the end of the weekend, the Crimson was back on top of the rankings. Since the senior class’ first national championship in 2015, Harvard has done a commendable job at maintaining its position atop collegiate squash as the consistent favorite.
The mission as the top dog is to maintain the gap between yourself and the upstarts hungry for blood. It has the potential to make goals more abstract and the path less clearly defined. Instead of building up throughout the season with the chance to reach glory one weekend with just one upset, the responsibilities of a defending champion are longer-term and even indefinite. Every single workout and training session is dedicated to maintaining a level of play that is championship-caliber. For women’s squash, these pressures have been present for the past three years. The goal is to sustain them as long as possible.

Obviously, with its three consecutive title defenses, the Crimson has been taking the pressure that comes with being a heavy favorite week in and week out. There is always uncertainty about the future, but the trajectory of achievement so far should scare the team’s opponents. The results and talent reveal that rather than any sort of deterioration in quality, women’s squash has become more dominant season after season.
In all three of its title defense years, the team has gone undefeated with a combined team record of 43-0, after going 13-1 in 2015 when the team won its first championship of the current run. But instead of absolute record, the scores of the individual matches paint a more lucid narrative of the refinement in class by the Crimson women.
The team’s only loss in 2015 came at Penn in a 4-5 decision when Harvard held a 4-3 lead in the final wave of competition but fell in the last two individual matches.
“Coming into my freshman year, I had no idea about how good of a team I was going to be on,” Yong said. “We had lost earlier in the year…and then being able to come back and win the nationals and do it for the seniors was sweet.”
There has been no such break in concentration since then. Instead, the scores have widened as the team has run farther away from the pack. In 2016, women’s squash glided relatively unscathed through the regular season and then edged Trinity and Penn in the national semifinal and final matches, respectively, by 5-4 margins. The Quakers proved to be the toughest challenge once again in the team’s second title defense season, but the Ancient Eight rivals’ regular season game and national championship matchup were both taken by the Crimson with a relatively easy 7-2 score line. This past season saw a frightening display of dominance, as the team had four 8-1 decisions during regular season play but managed to sweep all three games of the national championship.
“After [the first title in 2015], it was about maintaining that level and that standard, which sometimes is harder to do than winning in the first place,” Yong said. “So I think this year we had a really enthusiastic group of freshman and I think they stepped up really well…. We know there is a lot of pressure on us and every team is trying to bring us down, but I think we did really well with that pressure. We were still able to deliver, which was really good for us.”
As the team only graduates only two seniors, the continuity appears primed to continue the success of the past four seasons. The team is again adding top-level reinforcements with Egyptian recruits that will challenge for the top slots in the lineup. In contrast to competitive play, the recruiting game may now become easier because of Harvard’s sustained success and unchallenged status as the top women’s collegiate team.
While reflecting into the past and inferring about the future may be helpful to put the team’s success in perspective, the present is the origin and the reason for success.
Nothing says more about the present of the Harvard squash program than hard work. There are intense physical training regimens, especially during winter break when there are no competitions. Once matches start, the players taper off on their physical training, but the mental training regimen of visualization and putting squash in perspective powers forward and helps throughout the season. This training helped in the long term, as shown by the team’s consistent, dominant play going through the national championship game.
“On paper, [Trinity was] equally as good of a team, skill wise,” Mehta said. “I think where we really differentiated ourselves was just being mentally more prepared for them and physically more prepared for them because we had put in that work.”
Even with a small graduating group, the Crimson did not escape from its successful ways.
“Sue Ann and I were a very small class—there were only two of us, whereas there are usually three or four,” Mehta said. “So, I would like to think, personally, I was always a very big fan of putting in the really hard work, but I also think everyone else was extremely good at that. So, I like that culture that has been left behind.”
In the end, despite winning four national championships, currently boasting a teammate who is a two-time national individual championship finalist, and combining in a successful captainship, the pair must move on.
“I think I am going to really miss the team aspect of it because I think that is what made the whole thing so much better,” Yong said.
With the leadership of the duo, women’s squash has blossomed into the most successful sport at Harvard in recent history. The team is turning into a dynasty with which to be reckoned. Yong and Mehta are two of its empire-builders.

It’s March 3, and in front of sold-out crowd at Lavietes Pavilion, the Harvard men’s basketball team caps off its season with a 93-74 thrashing of a Columbia team it lost to earlier in the season. The win, along with a double-overtime victory against Cornell the night before, gives head coach Tommy Amaker his sixth regular season title in just eight seasons.
Storylines abound.
Harvard’s seventeen made three-pointers tie a program record. Penn—the heavy favorite to take the title heading into the weekend—lost on a last second buzzer beater to Yale the night before, giving the Crimson a chance to share the title. Harvard, despite losing former Ivy League Rookie of the Year Bryce Aiken to injury, has won eight of its last nine.
Perhaps most notably, though, Amaker—arguably the most noteworthy coaching addition to the conference in recent memory—ends a two year drought atop a conference he’s brought to national recognition.
It was, after all, under Amaker’s guidance that Harvard won its first ever conference championship in 2011, with the program ranked in top-25 polls for the first time in team history. From there, the Crimson would make four straight NCAA tournament appearances, with upset wins against New Mexico and Cincinnati coming in 2013 and 2014 and a near upset of North Carolina in 2015. Buoyed by the success, in 2016 Harvard brought in a class of freshman ranked 10th best in the nation.
In short, this win against Columbia is a bit of a return to glory.
In the ensuing celebration the typically reserved Amaker joins the team at centercourt with the championship trophy, gesturing towards a mass of players jumping up and down. It’s a Kodak moment if there ever was one.
Typically one to stick to the ins and outs of the game itself, Amaker is particularly candid in the postgame press conference.
“I hope you guys didn’t see me get in the stands out there,” he quips as he sits down.
Speaking largely to his foundation of sophomores—arguably the most talented class to ever enter the conference—Amaker notes the relative youth of a group that just earned the right to put up a championship banner, putting the youthful bunch in the context of the five other championship teams he’s coached.
“Last year’s team—it was very young, and again we’re still young. But last year’s team was even younger,” Amaker says. “We showed some of the clips of previous championship teams to our kids right before the game here tonight. We wanted them to recognize what it is like to be a part of that.”
And it’s true. If anything, Amaker was perhaps even understating the youth of the talented squad.

With the exception of junior guard Corey Johnson, no upperclassman on Amaker’s roster averaged more than nine minutes per game. On the season, and despite losing the previous season’s leading scorer Bryce Aiken to injury early on, over three-fourths of Harvard’s scoring came from Amaker’s heralded sophomore class alone. Including the three freshman on the team would push the number to nearly 89 percent of scoring coming courtesy of underclassmen.
Still, it’s another fitting chapter for a program that in all likelihood will remain relevant as long as Amaker is in Cambridge. The narrative of success—something increasingly difficult in the context of college basketball—is one inherently tied to Amaker’s recruiting ability.
In particular, the team’s sophomore class, consisting of three four-star recruits and another trio of three-star players has been at the center of the continued success inside the aged, but perhaps aptly recently renovated walls of Lavietes Pavilion. It’s not simply within the context of the Ivy League—but in many ways in context college basketball as a whole—that the rise of Harvard basketball and the conference with it, has been nothing short of remarkable.
An assessment of the sophomore class alone could tell the story.
Sophomore forward Chris Lewis, ranked the 68th best player in the nation as a senior, had offers from Memphis and New Mexico as early as ninth grade. He considered MIT before ultimately committing to Harvard.
Classmate Seth Towns, who earned Ivy League Player of the Year honors this season, turned down the likes of Michigan, a team that went to the championship game of this year’s tournament, and perennial contender Ohio State. Aiken picked the Crimson over heavyweights such as Miami, Seton Hall, and Auburn. 6’10’’ Robert Baker Jr. passed up on Georgia, Clemson, and USC, among others.
 The list could go on, but the narrative of such a turnaround at Harvard—particularly in the only conference in Division I that doesn’t allow athletic scholarships—is one that has been years in the making.

On a warm evening early in September of 2016, amongst a group of students standing outside Currier House and waiting for the shuttle, it would have been difficult to miss one individual in particular.
Standing at 6’10’’ and and just north of 260 pounds, Wendell Carter—then ranked the third best high school basketball player in the nation—was making his official visit to Harvard, then one of eight schools he was considering.
Carter, an Atlanta native, fit the bill of a paradigmatic student at Harvard. In high school he was a member of National Honor Society and was actively involved in theatre, at times missing the high-exposure world of travel basketball for rehearsals—all while maintaining near perfect grades.
Really he just happened to possess otherworldly basketball abilities along with everything else he did.
Days later, the senior would narrow down his list to just four schools—Harvard and Duke, along with in-state programs Georgia and Georgia Tech. In the process he cut out the likes of basketball powerhouses such as North Carolina, Arizona, and Kentucky.
At this point it was no well kept secret the choice for Carter was largely between the Crimson and the Blue Devils. In interviews, Carter’s parents, and particularly his mom, Kylia, expressed her hope Wendell would pick Harvard.
Two days after the visit, the high school senior was concise but unambiguous in his assessment of campus, tweeting out, “Harvard was a movie this weekend.”
The tweet must have inspired some semblance of concern out in Durham as less than a week later legendary coach Mike Krzyzewski and the entirety of the Duke coaching staff paid a direct visit to the Carter family in Atlanta. In the discussion at the Carter’s home were pleasantries such as Wendell’s post moves and Coach K’s appearance in NBA 2K.
Unsurprisingly, Carter picked Duke just over a month later.
The fact of the matter, though, is that Carter—who recently declared for the NBA Draft and is widely expected to be a top-10 pick—probably would not have considered Harvard ten just years back.
In later interviews, Carter noted his mom still wears her Harvard hoodie around the house.

Nestled in the picturesque New Jersey borough of Tinton Falls, an unimposing suburb indifferentiable from most in New England, sits the Ranney School—a private day school that up until recently wasn’t particularly known for much.
Surrounded by a clean white fence, it would be hard to imagine the selective prep school school is also competing to be one of the best high school basketball programs in the nation.
Headlined by a pair of shooting guards Bryan Antoine and Scottie Lewis, ranked the seventh and eighth best players in their recruiting class, Ranney has risen to the top of the cutthroat New Jersey high school basketball world. Also in the mix on the day school’s team is guard Alex Klatsky and center Chris Autino, both of whom have also been at the prep school since their freshman year.

The Ranney School, prior to the arrival of the talented bunch, had won just 20 games in a six year stretch. Buoyed by the talent, however, Ranney won the sectional championship this past winter and is expected to compete for the state championship next year. It’s now a program that’s being talked about nationally.
To the unsuspecting onlooker, Ranney’s rise to the top would be appear to be a modern day iteration of the plot of Hoosiers.
The nature of high school basketball these days, though, doesn’t necessarily lend itself to such organic narratives. The bunch of Antoine, Lewis, and Klatsky and have all been playing on the same nationally recognized AAU team for years now.
Nonetheless, with their senior year approaching, both Lewis and Klatsky have expressed their interest in Harvard.
Amaker, unsurprisingly, has pursued both of them with the tenacity of a major program.
Brian Klatsky, father of Alex and the founder of the AAU team both Klatsky and Lewis play on, isn’t shy about the turnaround the two have brought about at Ranney.
“Prior to Scottie and Alex, at Ranney there was no basketball history, the team had never had any success,” Klatsky says. “Scottie and Alex were the first two to come together at Ranney and from eighth grade going now into their senior year they took Ranney from nothing of obscurity in the basketball world to a top-20 national program and a state contender.”
To Klatsky, the mutual interest, particularly with a player of Lewis’ caliber, is in no small part a result of the environment at the tiny prep school. Describing Ranney as a ‘springboard’ for many students into the Ivy League, Klatsky sees that beyond a mutual interest between the two parties, there’s a mutual understanding of the value in academics.
“It’s still rare today is seeing a five-star recruit interested in an Ivy League destination but a lot of it just has to be with the environment he’s grown up in and putting academics first,” Klatsky notes.  “That’s what makes Scottie unique and what makes him really relate with Tommy.”
Amaker, who got his start in college basketball as a graduate assistant under Coach K after four years as a player at Duke, certainly has just as much recruiting experience as the coaches he’s trying to beat out. After a stint at Seton Hall where he became the youngest coach in Big East history and then six years at Michigan, to say the choice of Harvard was a surprise would be a bit of an understatement.
Always dismissive of his own role in the success he’s brought to the program, Amaker has brought an approach to recruiting that has unquestionably bore fruit. Speaking to Amaker’s recruitment of Alex and Lewis, Klatsky notes Amaker’s own role in pitching Harvard to the talented duo.
“They’ve had an unofficial visit, they’ve hung out with the team a little bit, they’ve been on campus,” Klatsky explains.  “Tommy has come down and sat down with them presented his vision of what it would look like playing in the Ivy League. They love it. It’s a special place and they know it. They respect and they appreciate. I’m not sure that in today’s world if all recruits really realize the doors that a Harvard can open for you.”
Lewis, in an interview with New York journalist Adam Zagoria this January, gave just a sense of the recruiting effort coming on behalf of the Crimson.
“I talk to coach Amaker every day now, he asks me about my grades,” Lewis said. “Coach Eski from Harvard as well.”
The appeal of Harvard, which Amaker has been known to pitch as a forty—not four—year decision, isn’t lost on the two potential recruits.
“They look at it as a very, very viable option,” Klatsky says. “Especially when you take Tommy’s resume and blend the basketball in with the school.”

It would be hard to point to a single event that changed the trajectory of recruiting both at Harvard and in the Ivy League.
It wasn’t, after all, overnight that the Crimson went from a team that had never won its conference to having Wendell Carter roaming the cobbled streets of Cambridge. When asked, though, most point to some combination of three events with a single one nearly always topping the list.
Interestingly enough, it was an event that really had next to nothing to do with recruiting or basketball.
Spearheaded by Harvard’s Financial Aid Initiative, which began in 2004 and culminating with a complete overhaul of the the college’s financial aid policies in 2007, the price of a Harvard education saw itself reduced for a substantial amount of potential applicants and students. It was particularly noteworthy for its assurance that families with annual incomes of 60,000 or less would not be expected to contribute towards tuition.
The rest of the Ivy League soon followed suit, with Yale, Dartmouth, Penn, Cornell and Brown pushing nearly identical initiatives months after. For its part, Princeton had been offering loan-free tuition since 2001 and Columbia added its own iteration just over a year later.
The changes couldn’t have come at a better time for Amaker, who was hired to coach the same year.
According to Carolyn Campbell-McGovern, the Deputy Executive Director of the Ivy League, the changes in financial aid were central in the changing dynamic of recruiting.
“One of the big changes that lead to the ability of our coaches to recruit more students from a wide variety of backgrounds was the change in financial aid policies that happened just about ten years ago, where all institutions made more financial aid to all students.” Campbell-McGovern says.
In particular, Campbell-McGovern notes the degree to which the changes put the conference in a place where it could at least compete with institutions that offered athletic scholarships.
“The fact that a middle-class family could come out of an Ivy League education without any or much debt was a pretty big sell—I think that was more able to compete with the athletic scholarship offers that other institutions had,” Campbell-McGovern says. “I think that really changed things for our coaches ability to compete.”
Though visible from the perspective of the conference as a whole, the changes and their impact on recruiting have been seen at the individual level as well. Brett MacConnell, an assistant coach and recruiting coordinator at Princeton has seen first hand the impact of aid.
“The financial aid in the Ivy League, and I’ve finished my sixth season, going into year seven—and I don’t know exactly what is was 10, 20 years ago—is excellent now and it hasn’t always been that way,” MacConnell says. “That’s had a major effect on the uptick in recruiting.”

Under his tenure the Tigers have increasingly managed to snag top recruits away from other programs. Currently a sophomore at Princeton, Myles Stephens turned down the likes of Seton Hall while senior Alec Brennan spurned contenders such as Wake Forest and Purdue.
Perhaps most notably, though, earlier this year Princeton received a commitment from Jaelin Llewellyn. A four-star recruit hailing from Ontario, Llewellyn had his choice of among 19 offers. Headlining his options were opportunities at Virginia, Tennessee, Providence, and Florida.
Yanni Hufnagel, an assistant and recruiter under Amaker at Harvard from 2009 to 2013 who would later do stints at Vanderbilt, Cal, and Nevada, views the change in financial aid in a similar light. Speaking to the changes he saw under his time, Hufnagel points to the expansion of aid as one of the key drivers in the recruiting changes the conference began to see while he was at Harvard.
“The changing landscape of financial aid changed the game as well, across the board,” Hufnagel notes. “Not just at Harvard.”

The backdrop of having athletes such as Carter and Lewis contemplating a school like Harvard is one that began well before either of them were considered to be professionally-bound. In fact it began when both were likely still in grade school.
“I think there are several events that paved the way for this reality that we’re living in right now,” Hufnagel says. “I would tell you Cornell’s run to the Sweet Sixteen, it coincided with Harvard’s hiring of Tommy Amaker. I would tell you those two events were the trampoline that the Ivy League needed to create parity.”
Within their context, both events undoubtedly had a notable impact on the way Harvard and the conference was viewed and as a result, who would consider it as a recruit. Amaker brought the pedigree of a coach who had been in the Big East and the Big Ten while Cornell’s improbable run put the conference on the map for the first time in a long time.
And what a run it was.
Coached by Steve Donahue—now coaching a Penn squad that would take down Harvard in the Ivy League Tournament final this season—No. 12 seeded Cornell made a run fit only for March.
The Big Red, which had gone 13-1 in its conference slate and lost just four games all season, took the tournament by storm. They began by disposing of No. 5 Temple 78-63 in the first round. In their next matchup, against No. 4 Wisconsin, Cornell doubled down on its first round performance, trouncing a Badgers team that had held opponents to an average of 56 points, 87-69.
Now in the Sweet Sixteen, the Big Red faced a No. 1 Kentucky team that had on its roster what are currently six NBA players including the likes of DeMarcus Cousins, Eric Bledsoe, and John Wall. Unsurprisingly, the Cornell’s Cinderella run ended at the hands of the Wildcats, 62-45.
The limelight of an Ivy League team in the Sweet Sixteen, however, is one that along with Amaker’s hiring, many consider as a turning point in the conference.
“I think Cornell’s success back in 2010 put the Ivy League on the map, having them in the Sweet Sixteen and having coming pretty close to at least being competitive with Kentucky in that game,” Campbell-McGovern says, “I think that made people take notice a little bit better about what was happening in the Ivy League and the level of basketball that was being played.”
Since that 2010 season—and also in no small part due to Harvard’s own success from 2011 to 2015—the perception of the Ivy League and Harvard in basketball has changed fundamentally.
“Tommy definitely brought a different level of recruiting caché to the Ivy League, just like Cornell playing in the Sweet Sixteen about this time and—I think people know this—suddenly different kinds of players were considering the Ivy League,” Campbell-McGovern notes.

The backdrop of college basketball recruiting is one that has only intensified in recent years, with athletes increasingly receiving offers before they even step onto a high school basketball court.
The last season of college basketball in particular has brought to light the often problematic nature of attempting to enforce amateurism in college basketball. In light of an FBI probe this February it was revealed college basketball players at multiple top programs had been receiving impermissible benefits, in some cases as massive as five-figure loans, in the process of recruiting.
Such a landscape, while certainly far removed from the scope of basketball in the Ivy League, presents what can only be described as considerable impediments when it comes to being competitive in recruiting and, by proxy, on the court.
Increasingly, Harvard and programs such as those implicated are going after the same players.
In regards to the changes that have ensued in college basketball and the conference’s increased difficulty in recruiting as a result, Campbell-McGovern offers a curt, but encouraging perspective.
“It’s difficult,” she says. “But it’s not impossible.”
Perhaps Amaker’s star-studded sophomore class speaks for itself in this regard.
Campbell-McGovern’s point, though, is indisputably true. Unlike the vast majority of conferences in Division I, the Ivy League operates under what’s called the Academic Index. While details on the index itself and its exact composition are hard to come by, its name is mostly self-explanatory in this regard. The index, ranging from 60 to 240 points, provides a score for athlete applicants as a combination of high school test scores and grades. There is a conference wide minimum under which no student athlete can be admitted and as described by Campbell-McGovern, it’s a system that relies on a degree self-regulation from admissions deans at the eight institutions.
“The agreement to use the Academic Index as a communication tool is among the admissions teams, the eight Ivy League schools,” Campbell-McGovern says. “We track that for them, we collect the eight academic indexes that they provide to us of all of their athletes and report that back out to them about who’s where, which students have which academic index. The admissions teams are the ones who review that information and really hold each other accountable for meeting the standards in place.”
The enforcement of regulation, despite apparently transparent information provided to admissions deans across the Ivy League, has not spared the conference from scrutiny. At the outset of Amaker’s tenure in Cambridge, reports surfaced that admissions standards had been lowered for the talent Amaker was recruiting back in 2008. In particular, Yale coach James Jones was quoted saying, “We don’t know how all this is going to come out, but we could not get involved with many of the kids that they are bringing in.”
To this point, though, Hufnagel is straightforward.
“The idea of Harvard or any other school changing admissions standards for basketball players is one of the most far fetched ideas that there is,” Hufnagel says. “Admissions standards don’t change. What changed was Tommy’s genius to bring really compelling stories to the admissions department.”

Campbell-McGovern also describes the degree to which schools address athletics recruiting on an institutional scale, this due to the fact the Ivy League places limits on the number of athletes each school is allowed to matriculate. In this regard, coaches and their respective athletic departments work together given the limits provided. Speaking to the uptick in particularly notable recruits, Campbell-McGovern describes the value of the transparency the conference provides.
“It’s up to each institution to use those spots as they see fit,” Campbell-McGovern explains. “The admissions deans review all of that information and if they see something that is different, an outlier, then they will call each other’s attention to that and ask for adjustments. That’s the method that we have in place to monitor that and regulate it.”
The most recent publicly available document from the Ivy League on the Academic Index itself—dating all the way back to 2001—offers bits of insight into the academic constraints under which the conference operated and likely still does.
In particular it notes that for men’s basketball and hockey, “the average Academic Index for each year’s group of admitted student-athletes must equal or exceed a specified score based on the average Academic Index of the school’s previous four admitted classes.”
While this is unsurprising, it presents a particular challenge when it comes to Harvard and perhaps even more so when it comes to basketball. Given incoming classes of particular teams are required to meet a minimum average set by their institution—a mark speculated to be set a standard deviation below the school average— schools with a higher average Academic Index have to be more stringent about the potential athletes they recruit.
To add to this, the conference caps the number of athletes who can travel on a given trip for basketball at 15 athletes. What this means is that an incoming class of recruits, usually between three and six athletes in basketball, has to meet a minimum based off its school average—something increasingly difficult at Harvard in particular, and on the relatively small roster of basketball.
***
If one were to turn the tables around and give coaches a choice of conference to recruit within, it would be difficult to make a case for the Ivy League as a preferable choice.
Between the choice of stringent academic guidelines and few to none, most would take the latter. Between the hope that a particular recruit will be covered by financial aid and the option to award an athletic scholarship, most would take the second choice again.
In many ways, Amaker’s heralded sophomore class is nothing short of a small miracle in the arc of Ivy League basketball. In many ways the entirety of the application process at Harvard represents a very different reality relative to schools that can and often hand out offers to athletes early on in their careers.
“You have to apply to Harvard before you know that you’ll be able to go there and student athletes have to be able to do that too,” Campbell-McGovern says. “It’s difficult for them—they have an offer in their hand that they know they can take and count on, and sometimes that’s happening earlier and earlier unfortunately, but our philosophy is that student-athletes have to be treated in the admissions process in the same as non-athletes so we’re going to continue to do that.”
From a recruiting perspective, this means there needs to be mutual effort on behalf of athletes. The process at Princeton, and similarly in the rest of the conference, is one vastly different from the rest of college basketball.
“A kid can say, ‘Oh I have on offer from state university,’ and he can commit there the next day and be admitted the next day,” MacConnell explains, “I think the people that want to come to Princeton understand that a little bit more effort on their part is well, well worth it in the long run as opposed to going somewhere where it’s that simple snap of the fingers and you’re into our school.”
Given the nature of the conference one might be lead to think that high-level recruiting—particularly in the Ivy League, at Harvard, and in basketball—is an exercise in futility. There do, however, exist means by which the conference attempts to stay competitive and keep potential recruits engaged through the process.
To reiterate Campbell-McGovern’s point—“It’s difficult. But it’s not impossible.”
Done on an institutional level, coaches are often in touch with the admissions office well before the admissions process begins itself in November and December of a students senior year. Though there are guidelines surrounding such conversations, coaches are provided guidance on which applicants would make strong candidates and which perhaps wouldn’t.
“We do have this feedback mechanism with admissions, but even that doesn’t start until July prior to senior year where the admissions office reviews transcripts and test scores and says, ‘Well I think this student is a viable candidate,’ so they can at least get that feedback along the way,” Campbell-McGovern explains.
“The coaches obviously know what the kind of test scores and background, in terms of extracurricular activities, that the admissions office is going to want to see. They’re really going to be able to narrow down who is really a viable candidate and provide some unofficial assurances to the students.”
Such conversations, which aren’t allowed to occur before July 1, give coaches the ability to adjust and focus their recruiting efforts.
Another aspect of the conference that coaches work around is the limit on the number of players that can travel on a given weekend. While this number is set at 15 athletes for basketball, all but two of the schools in the Ivy League had basketball rosters greater than 15 this season. Penn, the conference tournament champion, lead the way with 21 players on its roster this year. Harvard had 19. Brown and Dartmouth, the only two schools with 15 or less, finished the season last and second to last, respectively.
Though such a practice means the whole team isn’t allowed to travel and play on the road, for sports such as basketball that have limited rosters, it provides greater flexibility while navigating the recruitment process as a whole—in particular it gives coaches a greater number of athletes in the process of reaching a given Academic Index. This aspect of recruiting in the Ivy League, though it is has come under scrutiny in the past, by and large remains a fixture.
The narrative of scrutiny in regards to this practice is one that typically argues highly prized recruits are balanced out with a greater than necessary number of academically above-average athletes. Interestingly, this is something the conference has looked into in the past, albeit on a scale that goes beyond basketball in particular.
“We did do a study a few years ago, a while ago now, about whether the students who were playing were the ones who were the highest AI’s—basically a correlation between the playing time—and we found there wasn’t much of a relation.” Campbell-McGovern says.
“There’s a hypothesis,” she explains. “That the people who are not playing, not making the travel squad are the ones who are there because they brought the average up, and we found that to not be true.”
***
Despite the nuance associated with recruiting in the Ivy League, Amaker has been relentless in his pursuit of the best and the brightest.
In the past Harvard has been tied to now professional players such as Brandon Knight and Spencer Dinwiddie, the likes of which might be discussed in the same sentence as Carter and Lewis a few years down the road. Nonetheless, the possibility that an NBA-bound talent would want to spend a year in what most people don’t primarily associate as athletic conference is novel to say the least. Still, this off-chance presents what can only be looked at as an opportunity.
 Having worked particularly close with Amaker in regards to recruiting, Hufnagel offers a perspective most outside Lavietes Pavilion have rarely seen.
“You have to look at the opportunity cost,” Hufnagel says. “If you look at a game-changer of that magnitude, even if you try 100 times and only get him one time, it’s worth the investment because they can forover change the trajectory—they can open up the gate of the ‘I turned down the Duke, Kentucky, North Carolina, Kansas, UCLA, for Harvard.’ You’ve seen kids turn down almost everyone besides the Big Six.”
The last point is one that has been increasingly true. Scores of athletes, many on Amaker’s roster, turned down perennial contenders for Harvard. Wendell Carter, though, ultimately chose Duke.
Hufnagel—who in 2011 was voted the mid-major assistant most likely to “make it big-time due to his recruiting ability”—paints the off-chance commitment of a such a recruit in nearly prophetic terms.
“The allure of recruiting the five-star is unimaginably intoxicating and I would tell you that’s my psychology and that’s Tommy’s,” Hufnagel says. “That’s why we continue to do it even if the odds are long.”
He continues.
“If you do somehow swing and connect, it would be like winning Powerball. That’s why you continue to play the lottery.”
***
Recruiting, particularly among a set of eight schools where admissions are front-page newspaper material, provides a provocative discussion. The changes that have ensued, particularly due to the increasingly involved recruiting of Amaker, lend themselves to the possibility that at one point or another a player such as Carter or Lewis might actually matriculate.
Discussions of the potential for a ‘one-and-done’ athlete, whereby a player goes professional after just a year of college, are becoming less and less a territory of imagination at Harvard. Combined with the academic identity of the conference, such a possibility raises interesting questions—among them whether admissions offices would consider the possibility of admitting a student that would more than likely last just a year in college.
Prior to the Ivy League tournament this March, Amaker received a question on the possibility of a one-and-done athlete at Harvard. His response, in great length, would indicate it was something he had thought about.
“I think one of the things, what I’m in charge of doing, what I’ve been entrusted to do as a teacher and a leader on this campus, is to try to attract the kids that belong here,” Amaker began. “We have no crystal ball to say when it’s right or when someone will decide that another portion of their life has become more important.”
“We’ve had a variety of students and people here at this university who’ve done just that,” Amaker continued. “They haven’t been for basketball reasons, but they’ve been for other reasons. The number one thing is to try to make sure we stay true to our perspective and our ideals and our mission to try to attract the people that we honestly know and feel belong on this campus and this great institution.”
Almost as if rehearsed, Amaker closed out the monologue.
“And we’re going to try to continue to do that. If they happen to have enormous ability and game-changing talent in whatever they do and whoever they are, we like to welcome that with open arms.”
Though not in basketball, Ryan Donato’s jump to the NHL from Harvard’s hockey team would prove Amaker’s point just a few weeks later.
The question, though, of an athlete coming to Harvard with near certainty of leaving to pursue professional sports soon after, is one that the conference as a whole still hasn’t really approached.
“We don’t have any regulations about it so I don’t know exactly—I’m not sure we’ve had a conversation about it either,” Campbell-McGovern says. “The NCAA is trying to work to eliminate these one-and-done situations. Right now the players that are at that elite level, who are ready, at least physically, to play in the NBA, can’t.”
***
No discussion of recruiting would be complete without the man at the center of it all in Cambridge.
When describing Amaker the adjectives abound—charismatic, personable, engaging, remarkable. The list could go on.
It’s possible no amount of words could fully describe the role Amaker plays not just in recruiting, but in a Harvard community he’s been changing since the day he arrived. At the time of Amaker’s arrival, none of Harvard’s 41 varsity sports had an African-American coach. The trailblazing soon continued, as Amaker and faculty such as Ron Sullivan and Charles Ogletree began a breakfast club of local black leaders.
Since then Amaker has continued to be a presence outside of his work on the sidelines, inviting notable figures such Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to campus as part of a coaches clinic and later a conversation at the Institute of Politics.
The focus to life outside of basketball is one that Amaker has also incorporated into his recruiting. Speaking to the pitch Amaker has taken in regards to potential recruit Scottie Lewis, Klatsky notes it’s one that goes well beyond the scope of basketball.
“If you do a little research on Scottie you’ll find he’s very outspoken on different social issues and he’s a very articulate young man that’s a natural leader,” Klatsky notes. “Part of the message from Tommy has been, ‘Can you imagine how powerful your voice would be and the doors it would open to you in life being part of Harvard as a student and an athlete.’ All of that appeals to Scottie and so Tommy and him have really connected and it’s something he’s serious about.”
It’s in no small part due to Amaker that Harvard basketball has seen what is not so much a resurgence, but really its first prosperity ever. After the Harvard’s second NCAA tournament upset in 2014, perhaps Amaker himself put it best, saying, “We have become a program that has become relevant in the world of college basketball.”
And he’s continued to see it through since.
Hufnagel points out what at first seemed to be an unexpected, but soon enough appropriate, pairing.
“As long as Tommy Amaker is the coach at Harvard I think that Harvard’s recruiting has a limitless ceiling because it would be hard to find a better coach, leader, teacher, and father-figure than Tommy Amaker,” Hufnagel says. “Harvard found the one person walking this planet that was a perfect match for Harvard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Freshman Becca Gilmore wasted no time in making her mark on the Harvard women’s hockey program this year, notching two assists in her NCAA debut against Dartmouth in late October. Once the points started coming for the Wayland, Mass., resident, they didn’t stop. Gilmore finished the season with 35 points, a team best, alongside a team-high 16 goals and 19 assists.
Gilmore’s season was marked by a series of clutch performances, with the forward grabbing countless important goals and assists over the course of the season. The first year managed 12 multi-point outings this season, the most on the team, with five of these 12 coming in the last seven games of the season. Her three game-winning goals were also a team best, and her 35 points were the most by a Crimson freshman in 13 years.
Gilmore’s efforts did not go unnoticed, as she received recognition at various levels. Her season accolades include making the Second Team All-Ivy squad, as well as Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) All-Rookie team. Her 15 points in February were enough for second best in the NCAA. Gilmore claimed the Hockey Commissioner’s Association (HCA) National Division I Rookie of the Month for February, as well as the ECAC Rookie of the Month for the same period. Finally, Gilmore picked up two ECAC Rookie of the Week awards, one coming during her productive February.
Hockey has always been central to Gilmore’s life, as her whole family is very involved with the sport. Her mother played at Bowdoin College from 1978-1982, and her older siblings were important in getting Becca interested in the sport.
“I’ve been playing since two years old,” said Gilmore of her hockey background. “My mom played in college, she played her whole life, but it was really when my older brother started playing that I started following in my his footsteps. As I got older, it was always fun having my mom to talk hockey with. She really knows the game well, so I’m very thankful to have her to talk to, and it’s really fun when her and my dad get to watch me play.”
Some standout performances from Gilmore’s season include a goal and an assist in a 2-1 win at Rensselaer in January. The Crimson went down 1-0 early, before Gilmore scored one and created one, stealing the victory in New York. Gilmore led Harvard as it routed Holy Cross 8-3 at home in the first-ever matchup between the two programs, finishing with four points split evenly with two goals and two assists. After falling behind 2-1, Gilmore equalized and found the go-ahead goal for the Crimson, adding two assists before the game’s end.
Despite the fast pace of the college game, and college life in general, Gilmore insists that the adjustment has been straightforward. Her six-year varsity stint at Noble and Greenough and her two International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) World Championships from 2015 and 2016 may have helped to ease the transition.

“I was really fortunate I came from Nobles, it really prepared me well.” Gilmore said. “It was a similar platform, and so that was not as bad as a transition as I thought. I look up to a lot of upperclassmen who will be getting their work done on the bus or in the hotel rooms. You can’t pull all-nighters when you play a sport here, so you have to make sure you’re on top of getting ahead.”
Some of Gilmore’s most important contributions to the team came during a single week in February, when the playoff race began to heat up. During this time, the forward managed to rack up 11 points in four games over the course of seven days. Harvard won all four games, with Gilmore playing a vital role in each. These included a 3-2 home win against Union in which Gilmore scored twice and a 5-2 win at home over Rensselaer. In the latter game, Gilmore scored after she beat three defenders and the goalie with a brilliant spin move, before adding a trio of assists for a total of four points on the day.

The Crimson then played out a 4-3 Beanpot Consolation win against Northeastern, in which Gilmore assisted one and scored two, finding the game-winner in the third period. This outstanding week ended with a trip to No. 8/8 St. Lawrence, where Gilmore beat the goalie twice, enough to secure a 2-1 victory. This was Harvard’s first win against ranked opposition in almost two years, the last time coming in the 2016 ECAC playoffs. Gilmore pointed to the Northeastern game as one of the most significant team performances of the year.
“Even though we were hoping to be in the finals, there was a sense of pride on the line.” Gilmore said. “We were behind that game, we got off to a slow start, but it shows our team chemistry. We rallied, we had a lot of pride on the line, and we have a lot of love in this locker room. We came out in the third period really strong, ready to do anything it was going to take, blocking shots, making saves, and putting pucks in the net. That was definitely a memorable game for me and probably for the rest of the team as well.”
With a further three years to rack up points for the Crimson, the future looks bright for Becca Gilmore. If this season’s numbers can serve as a barometer, the sky's the limit for the freshman.
“These next four years I’m committed to becoming the best player I am, but at the end of the four years, I want to have a chance to make the 2022 Olympic roster,” Gilmore concluded. “That’s always been my goal, ever since I started playing. The next four years are going to be vital to that development.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Harvard men’s fencing captain and 2016 Olympian Eli Dershwitz first observed newcomer Geoffrey Tourette in-person, he quickly realized that even to his standards, this California native was going to be “special.”
Tourette had been no stranger to the medal podium before joining an already nationally-acclaimed fencing cast on its third-floor home inside the Malkin Athletic Center. The freshman foil competitor took home gold in both individual and team competitions at the 2016 Cadet World Championship, was a six-time national champion across several age groups, and is currently ranked by USA Fencing as the No. 1 American junior fencer in foil and No. 5 at the senior level.
This plethora of achievements would raise eyebrows for any college coach and program, but it was ultimately the strength of past relationships with current Crimson members that drew Tourette to Cambridge. Sophomores Erwin Cai and George Haglund, namely, were cited by Tourette as critical lobbyists toward persuading the young recruit. Others such as Dershwitz were not further behind, paying close attention to his high school tape and following his slew of accomplishments.
“I think I started my first international competition five or six years ago, and some of the people who were on the team now were actually traveling with me at that time,” Tourette said. “That’s how I got to know a lot of the team. I made a lot of close friendships that way.”
Even with such attention and interest, Tourette made it immediately apparent in his first fall semester that there was no sense of entitlement in his work attitude. In the frigid, raining dusk of an early fall-semester Saturday, team captain Dershwitz inquired his team via text about taking a run up the steps of Harvard Stadium. The only respondent? Tourette.
“We were the only people on the stadium that morning, and I told him that nobody else was willing to put in the work on that cold, rainy morning that we just put in,” Dershwitz wrote. “I really think that workout and that day resonated with him, and I truly hope that after I graduate, he will pass down those words to future generations of our team as he tries to instill the same work ethic in them.”
This level of commitment before the official start of the season quickly translated on the fencing mat. In Tourette’s first career college meet at the Penn State Open, the Cupertino, Calif., native executed a weekend high plus-23 touch differential to win his bracket 15-6 and capture gold. It was during this first tournament that Tourette rationalized he could truly surpass even his initial expectations.
“I think it was probably after my last round of pools [when] I kind of settled myself into the atmosphere of college fencing with all the different schools cheering,” Tourette said. “But having the Harvard team behind me, everything just helped get me comfortable and that’s when I felt like I had joined the team 100 percent.”
Tourette quickly solidified himself as a near-unbeatable adversary. In the Traditional Tournament on Dec. 3, the Crimson challenged five schools—Vassar, NJIT, NYU, Penn State, and Sacred Heart—where Tourette achieved a team-high 10-1 record. The freshman was undefeated at the Beanpot Tournament two months later with a plus-21 touch differential and 7-0 mark.
“The thing that impressed me the most about his game was how confident he was in his ability to win, which stemmed with his confidence in the amount of work he has put in,” Dershwitz wrote. “His amazing attention to detail and to the absolute fundamentals to the sport of fencing, as well as his amazing work ethic are what set him apart.”
At the Ivy League Championships, Tourette cemented his place as the best fencer in foil within the Ancient Eight with a perfect 15-0 individual record. Collectively, the Crimson delivered its 10th Ivy League men’s title in history, its fifth in the last decade. It is this feeling of team success and achievement, Tourette emphasized, which has made college fencing so distinctive from his years of traveling internationally as a solo competitor.
“Everybody needs to support each other, and a huge part of that isn’t when you are fencing, but when you are cheering and when you are just rooting for your teammates,” Tourette said. “The support that you get from your teammates, and the support that you give teammates is what really makes college fencing what it is, which is super enjoyable.”
To cap off the season, the freshman broke through again at NCAA Regionals with a top-of-the-leaderboard outing of 20-3. Qualifying for the National Championships, Tourette ultimately concluded his season with a top-10 finish at seventh overall. Among his competition at the national level, only two freshmen finished ahead of Tourette in foil.
Even with these accomplishments in stone, Tourette’s aspirations continue to enlarge. In sight for the future include U-20 Team USA competitions and other commitments that will take him from Paris to Shanghai this year.
The ultimate goal, what Tourette called his “top priority,” still remains qualifying for the Olympics. With a participant in Dershwitz inside Tourette’s own locker room, the freshman emphasized the importance of the continuing guidance of his junior captain in striving to reach Tokyo in 2020.
“Eli has been a great mentor as far as fencing goes and honestly as far as everything in my Harvard experiences, he’s in there for me,” Tourette said. “It is just really amazing what he has been able to do, the discipline he has...just trying to keep up with him and hopefully one day I hope to reach his level, that is the goal.”
For his fellow young stadium-runner, the Olympian fencer did not hold back in endorsing the freshman’s bid for international stardom. Fencing within the walls of the Malkin Athletic Center appears, for both Dershwitz and his young mentee Tourette, to be stage one in the quest for success at the highest level of competition.
“Given these traits, and the level of discipline that is required to be a successful athlete at an amazing academic institution like Harvard, I strongly believe that he has what it takes to take gold at the U20 World Championships next year and to one day make an Olympic Team.” Dershwitz concluded.

Coming into college, I had never really taken the chance to think about what sports meant to me. Growing up outside of Philadelphia, sports were always a thing that were there, but I never really had thought about why I loved them so much. Whether it was watching SportsCenter while eating breakfast or a Phillies game during dinner, playing hockey in my driveway with my brothers, running cross country and track, or spending Friday nights with friends at football or basketball games, sports were a huge part of my upbringing. However, it took me until college to realize why sports are so important to me.
Sports are often praised for their ability to bring people together. The narrative usually describes kids going to baseball games with their dads or how a team can help lift the spirits of fans who live and die with every game. In a football crazy town like Philadelphia, the Eagles’ Super Bowl victory in February certainly created a sense of pride and community for a fanbase that is notorious for pelting Santa Claus with snowballs.
I didn’t realize that my high school experience of playing and watching sports so religiously was the exception rather than the norm. Sports dominated car rides to school, free periods, and conversations at dinner. When I came to Harvard in the fall of 2014, I learned not only how to write a rugby article while comping the Sports Board of The Crimson, but also that not everyone at Harvard cared about sports. Who would’ve thought?
While the jubilation associated with victory is unique in its ability to bring people together, I’ve found at Harvard that sports can bring people together—albeit in a different way—no matter which sport or team that they love. Of this year’s seniors, Sam Christenfeld and Katherine Scott follow soccer religiously, Jackson Reynolds doesn’t miss tuning into an Alabama football game, Troy Boccelli is a diehard Chicago Bulls fan, and Sam Danello tortures himself by watching the Cleveland Browns (Sam once likened the Browns’ struggles against the Pittsburgh Steelers to having one’s legs run over by an 18-wheeler twice a year).
When Michael Ledecky persuaded me to come to the first comp meeting during my freshman fall, I didn’t anticipate that the Crimson Sports Board would make up such an important part of my college experience. While my love of sports brought me to the board, the people ultimately were the reason why I stayed. Some of my best friendships from college were formed while producing supplements on Thursday nights, driving up and down the East Coast covering basketball games, staying for Commencement the last two years, and planning in common rooms in Lev and over margaritas at Border. I watched the Cubs break their 108-year World Series drought eating Domino’s with the Sports Board at the Crimson, and I wouldn’t have wanted it any other way.
The Crimson gave me the opportunity to not just travel the world and sit courtside at countless basketball games but also the opportunity to form some of my most meaningful relationships at Harvard. Getting to cover basketball games in China and at the largest indoor arena in the US was pretty amazing, but what was better was getting to spend time in Shanghai and Lexington with some of my best friends from college. Having the opportunity to hold a leadership position with one of the most storied college newspapers was gratifying, but primarily because of the opportunities to work with some of the most genuine and hardest working people at Harvard. I’m so grateful to the 142nd and 143rd guards for their leadership, friendship, and mentorship. You all helped our class grow as writers and really made us feel like members of a community from the get-go. The board is in good hands with the 145/146/147 and I’m really excited to see where you guys will take it over the next few years.
What I will remember most about my time with the Sports Board is not how many stories I wrote or the success of the teams that I covered but rather the friendships that I formed and the experiences that I had over the past four years. Whether it was mind melding with Sam and Troy over the past two years, staying up until 4 a.m. editing hockey stories with Jake, coming up with kickers and captions, watching a whole lot of basketball, spending Thursday night supp nights and happy hours at 14 Plympton, Grand Elections, trips to the Kong, Dok Bua, and knockoff China King, closeouts, champagne showers, or basketball games against the HPR, some of my fondest memories of college are from The Crimson.

The winningest coach in Ivy League basketball history, tallying 567 wins over 36 seasons, has done much more than elevate Harvard women’s basketball to the national spotlight. She has coached the USA national team on three separate occasions, including as the head coach during its gold medal victory at the 2005 World University Games in Turkey. Kathy Delaney-Smith’s resume seems full, but it is far from finished.
Upon her arrival in Cambridge in 1982, Delaney-Smith had already completed six undefeated seasons, compiled a 204-31 record, and won a state championship with Westwood High School in Massachusetts.
Although the Crimson struggled in its first year under Delaney-Smith, the new coach quickly instituted her own style and inspired the team. She led the squad to its first-ever Ivy League title in the 1985-1986 season, recording her first 20-win season.
Over the years, Delaney-Smith’s impact on her long list of players strongly resonated.
“She just knows so much about the game, and cares so much about making us better as players and as people,” said Taylor Rooks, a recent senior guard under Delaney-Smith who transferred to Harvard after her freshman year at Stanford. “Kathy’s experience, and her knowledge of the game, I knew it coming here, and I knew she was going to make me a better player, but I am so grateful for her letting me transfer to Harvard.”
Delaney-Smith recorded what was arguably one of her most successful seasons in the 1997-1998 campaign. This Harvard squad won 23 games, a record not only for Kathy, but also for the institution. This earned Harvard a berth in the NCAA Tournament as a 16-seed. The Crimson upset the top-seeded Stanford for its first-ever NCAA Tournament win to become the first 16-seed to ever upset a one-seed in the NCAA Tournament, men’s or women’s.

The success and pride that Delaney-Smith brought to Harvard basketball rippled throughout the entire university community.
“It was tremendously exciting to be in the tournament, even as a 16-seed,” recalled Professor Harry Lewis, then the dean of Harvard College. “It was really a moment of extraordinary pride…. I got inspired and had to go down and meet the coach and the team at the airport on their return with a dozen red roses.”
Delaney-Smith’s impact on Harvard did not stop with the prolific season and upset victory in 1998. This past season, Delaney-Smith led the Crimson to an 18-11 season, supported by its 10-4 conference record. At the newly renovated Lavietes Pavilion, Harvard finished a perfect 12-0. This impressive home record included back-to-back home wins against future conference champion Princeton Tigers as well as the Penn Quakers, with the Crimson having fallen to the latter in nine straight previous meetings before this season’s victory.
Although her achievements on the court speak to Delaney-Smith’s legacy and importance to Harvard basketball, there is much more to her coaching than statistics.

“She is so much more than just a coach on paper,” Rooks said. “She made my experience, the experiences of all my teammates, so much better. Knowing that we’re going to be treated equally, that there’s someone in our corner fighting for us, it’s just awesome.”
Delaney-Smith has shown her care for her players both on and off the court. On one occasion, Delaney-Smith encountered a visiting boys high school team who prevented her high school team from entering its own locker room. Subsequently, she instructed her team to walk straight past a teacher guarding the door and later filed multiple Title X lawsuits in response to the incident. At Harvard, Delaney-Smith has brought to fight.
“It’s rare to have someone who cares so much about what happens on the court as well equality off the court,” Rooks said. “Kathy is so passionate about women’s equality, it transcends all women’s sports about sports in general. It’s rare, but such a blessing to have someone who’s advocating for equality, equal locker rooms, stuff like that.”
Following another prosperous season, Delaney-Smith’s work is far from over. Her full slate of achievements aside, Delaney-Smith will return for a 37th season, looking to command the Crimson to her 11th Ancient Eight title.
