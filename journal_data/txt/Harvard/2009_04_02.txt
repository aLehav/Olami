After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the center of a labyrinth of canvasses, easels, stools, and drop cloths, Nancy Mitchnick—one of the only two studio painting teachers in the VES department—presides over her class on the third floor of the Carpenter Center. Pungent smells of fresh gesso mingle with turpentine while an eclectic mix of music sets the creative mood. With a couch and a makeshift kitchen, it is clear that many student painters view the studio as a sort of second home and Nancy, as she is fondly called, as a sort of stand-in mother. “Students congregate and sometimes practically move in,” writes former studio teaching fellow Claire W. Lehmann ’03 in a letter addressed to President Drew G. Faust in support of Mitchnick, who will be leaving next year. “Often I would arrive in the morning to find students passed out on the couch after marathon sessions.” 
Despite the sense of comfort students experience in the studio, Mitchnick’s imminent departure leaves many students questioning the continuation of the program’s quality, fearing more generally that VES is moving in an increasingly conceptual direction. 
 NANCY, DON’T GO

After joining the department as a visiting lecturer 15 years ago, Mitchnick was appointed senior preceptor and a Rudolf Arnheim Lecturer on Studio Arts in 1998. In recognition of her outstanding performance, Mitchnick was also awarded the Phi Beta Kappa Teaching Prize in 2001.
“She has been fearlessly devoted,” VES Professor Drew Beattie says. “Teaching isn’t a job for her. It’s a mission. It’s a devotion, not a job. Not all teachers are like that, not even at Harvard.”
Mitchnick’s commitment to teaching has been noted by faculty and students alike. After attending a creative and performing arts magnet school for four years, going to the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) seemed like a logical choice for Kayla A. Escobedo ’12. Yet, Escobedo’s visit to Nancy’s classroom in October of 2007 led to a change of course. 
“Before I had even applied to Harvard, I brought my portfolio and talked to some students who told me about the VES department. They told me that I had to sit in on Nancy Mitchnick’s class before I left,” Escobedo says. “I did and I was blown away. Her passion and her dedication instantly struck me. I was about to go to RISD, but I remember that experience with Nancy.”
Other students voice similar appreciation of her teaching style. “As an individual instructor, Nancy has an incredible style—harsh, but loving,” says VES concentrator Rebecca R. Rojer ’10. “She helps students get over their fear of failure and work towards making their best art.” 
Despite widespread admiration, this semester will mark the end of Mitchnick’s dynamic and influential presence in the department. According to the terms of her current contract as an Arhnhiem lecturer, Mitchnick is only allowed a once renewable five-year appointment. But the contract does not state that she and other Arnheim lecturers cannot be hired under different circumstances. 
Yet the VES administration has demonstrated little, if any, commitment to finding another position for Mitchnick within the department. 
“If we had—which we don’t—a position for a tenured faculty position, she could be conceived of as a candidate,” says Marjorie Garber, chair of the VES department. “But she would be competing with hundreds of others. There are no reserved positions.” 
Given the praise Mitchnick’s teaching has garnered from students and professors, many speculate that there might be more to her departure than simply the technicalities of a contract.
“I think there is this feeling that what Nancy does isn’t hip enough,” Rojer says, referring to Mitchnick’s attention to the fundamentals of painting technique. “If it’s not going on in the insular, coastal, and market-driven art world, then the VES department doesn’t really care.”
Still, the administration maintains that Mitchnick’s departure is solely a contractual issue. “People leave the university and people come to the university. This is not a surprise to her or to the department; we retained her as long as the appointment category permitted us to,” Garber says. “But, the department is absolutely committed to replacing Nancy with someone who teaches painting.”
Garber hopes to eventually fill a tenured faculty position to teach studio painting, but with the current hiring freeze, this is not an option. The proposed solution is to bring in various visiting faculty, which could have both positive and negative ramifications according to Rojer. 
“Visiting professors are great because they keep things from getting stale. They are in the field and making art and have a perspective that you lose being at Harvard your entire career,” Rojer says. “But at the same time, it lacks stability. Students are doing their theses, and that’s the culmination of your work; a visiting professor just isn’t going to be able to understand it in the same way someone who has been advising you for years will.”
In addition to Mitchnick’s departure, current visiting professor Andrew Beattie—VES’ only other studio painting teacher—is slotted to depart at the end of the 2009-2010 school year. In the absence of definitive plans for filling either opening, the fate of the painting program in the department remains ambiguous.
Garber is aware of the concerns regarding thesis advising and, more generally, the future of the curriculum, but she assures students that the painting program holds a secure place in the department.
“I understand that students are anxious because of Nancy leaving,” Garber says. “I don’t blame them.” 
“We do have practices that we are absolutely committed to teaching. We will always have a strong dedication to drawing and painting.” 
TO THINK OR TO MAKE

In light of the administration’s confirmation that painting is still on the agenda, the concern becomes not whether painting instructors will be available, but what the driving philosophy behind the next generation of painting classes will be. 
“It’s never going to be a situation where people are for or against paint,” Beattie explains. “It’s about what you define as painting.”
Mitchnick’s departure—more than just the loss of a beloved mentor—may point to a larger trend in VES. As a teacher known for her intense focus on the more traditional and basic techniques behind painting—from the origins and mixing of paints to the stretching of canvas—many view her leaving as the loss of a more traditional teaching approach to painting and a shift toward a more conceptually driven department. A shift not all are welcoming with open arms  
“Everyone thinks they can talk about art, they think that painting is a hobby, but it’s like operating on a patient.” says one member of the VES faculty who asked not to be named. “For someone who is a real painter, it’s a very serious thing, it is a profession, and at most schools they seem to understand that except here.”
“What she represents is controversial,” Beattie says. “It’s not an easy situation. She hasn’t done it in an easy way; she has been outspoken. I’m sure there are tons of people who don’t agree with what Nancy represents, and there are tons of people who think what she does is vital.”
Mitchnick’s style may not fit into current trends that dictate that technique is secondary to conceputal creation, though she maintains that one does not necessarily preclude the other.
“The latest dictum is that ‘skills are obsolete,’’ Mitchnick writes in an email. ‘There is great work being made, important, current, contemporary, thought-provoking work that doesn’t depend on knowledge of or experience with materials. It doesn’t replace painting, but it fits more easily into academia.” 
Beattie proposes that this shift, if it indeed exists, may be an effort to intellectualize VES in order to legitimize its existence within an Ivy League university. “The trouble with art at an elite institution is there is such an importance place on codifying quality and excellence here,” he says. “When people are making creative speculative work, it’s frightening, because they don’t know how to measure that or teach that, because it is so subjective.”
In addition to problems of subjectivity, this tentative transformation may stem from trends in the broader art community, which has seen a rise in more conceptual, installation type works. 
“There is just a tremendous amount of flux going on with how art is constructed and theorized and produced, and that is felt by all institutions,” says VES Director of Undergraduate Studies Robb Moss. 
But against growing trends, VES students insist that the fundamentals of painting are still of utmost importance to their growth as artists. “It’s like trying to write a paper with a third grade vocabulary,” Rojer says. “We have Expos for English classes. Art students want to learn the basics; what makes this any different? I think there needs to be greater respect for the visual and what that means as a tool of communication.”
While some perceive that the department is moving in an increasingly conceptual direction—as indicated most recently by Mitchnick leaving—administrators dispute that notion, claiming that her departure is not representative of such a move. “We are not headed in any ideological direction,” Garber says. “We are looking for good artists who are good teachers to teach where there is student demand.” 
“We want to have a range of practices and skills and a range of artists who would be able to model various modes of art production for our students.”
Emphasizing this encouraged convergence of the practical and the conceptual, she continues, “Every artist is a thinker and a doer. I don’t think that there is that kind of absolute split people often create.” 
Yet the problem may not be that students in the department see the practical and the conceptual in dichotomous terms but rather that they remain unconvinced of the balanced co-existence of the two that Garber claims characterizes the curriculum.
“Within the studio there is a competition between the highly conceptual and more traditional representation,” says Rojer. 
Patrick A. Gordon ’11, one of Mitchnick’s current students, feels even more strongly about the tension that exists. “They [VES] want me to become more conceptual and be forced down a particular road,” he says. “I’m not looking to be pigeon-holed.” 
James A. Powers ’08, Mitchnick’s teaching assistant, asserts that what students want is a balance of the two in their classes. “Many students see the conceptual courses here as superficial ‘Pitchfork critiques’ on art,” he wrote in a letter to President Drew Faust, “if not complimented with a practical element that encourages aggressive empirical analysis from a hands-on practicing painting professor.” 
 TROUBLING TIMES

Despite this ostensible agreement between administration, faculty and students regarding the necessary balance between the making and the theorizing of art, tensions remain due to what students feel is the administration’s failure to listen to their concerns. 
“It seems to me that the administration is one level separated from the faculty which is separated from the students, and they all have different visions of what VES should be,” Gordon says. “They provide basic resources, but as a whole VES isn’t focusing on student needs.”
“There’s not much of a sense of community across VES that really involves the staff and administration,” Escobedo reiterates. “It’s all student created and professor-student relationships.”
The perceived inaccessibility of the administration leaves students unsure of how to address major issues, such as the painting curriculum, a lack of stable advising, the dearth of student art shows, inadequate supply of high-end materials and the disconnect between various sections within VES— problems they feel are detrimental to the learning environment and hinder VES’ development.
“It has the potential to be a strong department with a fantastic building and fantastic resources,” says Gordon, “but I haven’t talked to one person who is really happy with the way the VES department is run.”
Yet the administration insists that it is more than willing to hear the students concerns. “I’m in this office all day every day,” Garber says. “Anyone can come talk to me. My door is open. I’m happy to talk to you.” 
But a member of the VES teaching staff who asked not to be identified said this open-door policy is less than effective. "We've just stopped trying to talk to them. We've stopped questioning her [Garber] because she just doesn't give answers. You can't walk into the first floor of the Carpenter Center and get anything reasonable. They are administrative people there that don't know anything about art. They know nothing nothing nothing about art."With such discrepancies in opinion among staff and students, there is an evident need within the department for introspection if concerns about its future are to be resolved.“I think there is a moment arriving where the department really needs to look hard at what it is doing and representing,” says a VES Professor, who wishes to remain anonymous. “What is the curriculum and what is the balance? Is there a need to look a little deeper? There is a need for a lot more conversation.” 
In this period of transition for the VES, Mitchnick’s departure is simply the most recent upset in what have been difficult times. The imminent change has not only troubled ardent supporters of the painting instructor, and alumni, but also unearthed longstanding, deeper anxieties concerning the direction in which the department is headed. Yet if VES is to continue to fulfill its mission to provide the best education possible to its students, then the troubling perception that the position of a more traditional, hands-on approach to art education has been rendered precarious by a move towards the theoretical must, at least, be brushed upon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As a busy Saturday evening dinner service became a very busy Saturday evening dinner service, I watched as a fellow waiter burst suddenly into tears.The restaurant’s background music had just transitioned from a soulful Diana Ross ballad to Patsy Cline’s “Crazy,” and I couldn’t decide whether “men are dogs,” “insufficient tip,” or “another waiter’s gibes” was a likelier explanation for her sorrow. “My mother played this when she got the divorce papers,” she explained without inquiry. Stunned, I did what any human would do in my situation—I asked the manager on duty to put on That Funk. Upon exiting the ladies room, makeup comparatively less smudged, Earth, Wind & Fire’s “Boogie Wonderland” welcomed her back. A fortified smile quickly emerged over her still salt-stained face. Moving confidently to a full banquette, she plied a group of patrons to order another round of cocktails, and it was as if nothing had ever happened.It goes without saying that music can greatly influence mood and behavior—more so for some than others, and often in unpredictable ways. A group of researchers in Austria, however, has recently taken this truism to trial—clinical trial, that is—and has begun to market what might be the most promising music therapy system to date, SANOSON.The concept of music as clinically-proven therapy is not as foreign as it might have once been. The fortune cookie wisdom of my grade school years, for instance, dictated that children weaned on classical music would grow up smarter. Playing an Antonio Vivaldi or Antonin Dvorák cassette tape while studying one’s times tables conferred A’s, so it went. SANOSON, however, does not claim to have made strides in the field of child-smartening, nor does it aim to mimic the musical folk therapy employable on, say, crowded restaurant floors. Rather, it aims to combat the stressors that many long-term hospital patients and the gravely ill face during recovery. Patients are prescribed a schedule of musical compositions, the energy levels of which are designed to parallel their daily activities. SANOSON patients are prescribed sets of music to listen to for a set number of hours over the week to this end, the ultimate goal of which is to ease the strain of recovery.   To date, there has been little clinically-backed research in this field, for the simple reason that music therapy exists outside of any single discipline. The research into the effects of music on the body requires adeptness in a diversity of fields, and an incorporative application of that knowledge. This is strange new territory. Any forays into “musical pharmacology” are bound to be fraught with resistance and skepticism from doctors and patients alike. Though they draw upon the varied fields of neurobiology, endocrinology, psychology, sociology, and physiology, SANOSON hopes to synthesize these diverse disciplines into a single, clinically-proven treatment. The key, researchers believe, lies in synchronizing a patient’s regulatory processes to the prescribed music. SANOSON is one of the first companies to demonstrate the effectiveness of such synchronization in a clinical setting. As noted in a recent New York Times article, when these processes and structures were properly paralleled in patients with hypertension over a four week program, “patients experienced clinically significant improvements in heart-rate variability.”These results, though only a first step, are as compelling as they are thought-provoking. If music is to be harnessed for its pharmacological powers, might it not hold the potential for dangerous interactions? Remember the crying waitress? Van Morrison’s “Astral Weeks” is good to write to, and the electronic band MSTRKRFT quite great to run to, but such selections would certainly have deleterious effects on performance if poorly prescribed. Last year, Harvard students downed the strange cocktail of the Wu-Tang Clan, Gavin DeGraw, Joey DeGraw (sigh), and whatever other substances they chose to introduce into their systems that day. Although SANOSON offers therapies comprised generally in lyric-less, original compositions, one can’t help but relate the researchers’ clinical findings to one’s own musical habits. It’s hard to predict, for instance, how a swig of Sara Bareilles will pair with a rip of Ratatat. Whatever the blend, it will define the collective mood for the day. These most recent developments by SANOSON are exciting for the simple reason that we all know the raw power music has to influence us—whether we be YardFest attendees or restaurant waitresses. But until science offers us an equation for managing pain or stress with music, we will continue to self-medicate, ignorant of the calculus of our hearts but wise to their temperaments.—Ruben L.

At Harvard—where talent and accomplishment are openly and publicly lauded—community members may not always realize the incredible emotional challenges that some students face privately. But when one woman asks herself, “Why did I convince myself that it was because of the way I danced? Why did I believe you when you said that you understood and that you were sorry?”; when a survivor warns, “He’s the one you least expect”; when yet another states, “[I] waited at the hospital in an exam room for three hours waiting for a rape kit and never got one,” the impact that incidents of sexual assault have had on these individuals is undeniable.“Saturday Night: Untold Stories of Sexual Assault at Harvard,” an artistic and literary magazine published by the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (OSAPR), presents raw and powerful first-hand narratives of sexual assault. Through sobering, emotional, and sometimes frustratingly real accounts, the magazine serves as a forum for dialogue about sexual assault, allowing concerned students to voice their opinions regarding the issue. It also acts as a healing outlet for survivors of sexual assault and seeks to increase consciousness about the issue throughout the Harvard campus. The launch party marking the release of the third edition will take place Saturday, April 18, during Sexual Assault Awareness Month.This year, the magazine has broadened its content. The third edition of “Saturday Night” will include a more diverse range of commentary from members of the community who have not necessarily experienced sexual assault. OSAPR sent out a survey over email lists a few weeks ago, which asked students to respond to six questions. “[The questions were like] ‘How would your life be different if sexual assault didn’t exist anymore?’ and ‘What needs to happen to end it?’” OSAPR Director Sarah A. Rankin says. “We got an enormous response, which was really impressive.” The editors of “Saturday Night” culled quotations from 20 pages of reactions, which they included in a special section of the edition.The “Saturday Night” project, which originated at Duke University in 2003, was founded by Neagheen Homaifar ’10 at Harvard three years later. As a freshman with an older sister at Duke who worked on “Saturday Night,” Homaifar was already familiar with the publication. She approached Rankin at an organizations fair and suggested bringing the magazine here, primarily because she believed members of the Harvard community might underestimate the prevalence of sexual assault on campus due to the institution’s prestige.According to Homaifar, because the problem of sexual assault was more prominent at Duke than at Harvard at that time, the Duke community was understandably more concerned with the issue. Homaifar was perhaps referring to an incident in 2006 when three members of the college’s lacrosse team were prosecuted for the alleged rape of a local dancer.But Homaifar, who was surprised at the lack of discussion regarding sexual assault beyond Freshmen Week, hoped that the magazine would serve the purpose of making more visible the private struggles of ostensibly strong and capable students. “It may be difficult to recognize that many students also have these personal battles related to...sexual assault,” Homaifar says. Harvard students, she adds, may not see sexual assault as a prevalent problem within their community. “The issue is not relegated to people of a certain socioeconomic or educational background,” she says.At Duke University, “Saturday Night” began after one anonymous victim of sexual assault decided to write about the incident in The Chronicle, the student daily. After calling for others to speak out about similar experiences, she received a variety of responses, which moved her to compile the stories into a publication she named, “Saturday Night: Untold Stories of Sexual Assault at Duke.” The founders of the magazine at Duke—Allison Brim, Lauren Jarvis, Ryan Kennedy and Monica Lemmond—write in a preface to the first Harvard edition that the Duke publication not only aimed to provide victims of sexual assault with “empowerment and healing” but also intended to “touch and inform all readers, galvanizing a moment to end sexual assault at Duke.” Never meant to be a passive reflection, the “Saturday Night” project has always intended to inspire empathy in its readers. Its Harvard sister publication remains committed to the same goal.The personal nature and proximity of the various stories submitted to “Saturday Night” are integral to the magazine’s aims. Rankin says that first-hand accounts can take sexual assault “from the abstract to the personal,” rendering them both relatable and powerful. Narrative details offer those who feel alienated by statistics a different approach to the subject. “While some need numbers, others need a personal perspective; we’re providing that personal perspective,” Homaifar says, stressing that both types of information can be found in the magazine. Another editor, Alexandra N. Bolm ’09, adds, “The problem that I find with statistics is that a lot of people like to question them.” The personal stories in “Saturday Night” confront the undeniable emotional impact of sexual crimes. With such stark sincerity at their fingertips, readers cannot fail to acknowledge the presence of sexual assault—however indirect—in their own lives.The most powerful impact of “Saturday Night” takes place in the minds of the contributors themselves. Survivors write anonymously and are guaranteed that their work will not be edited except for grammar and identifying details. According to Rankin, for some, “the act of writing their story is healing and cathartic in itself, and they hadn’t expected it.” While survivors are at different stages in the healing process when they begin to tell their stories, Rankin says that some contributors found motivation to seek professional counseling after writing their accounts for the magazine. In its own way, “Saturday Night” suggests the immense power of narrative; through both the creation and spread of the magazine, “Saturday Night” stands as an emblem of our faith in art not only to heal personal wounds but also to inspire community connections with regard to the most private of human trials.

Like fireflies, the work of Niisato Akio resembles delicate orbs of light. And this spring will bring both to Boston with Niisato’s first U.S. exhibition. The slender, white porcelain creations are etched with intricate patterns, shaped as both everyday vessels and more obtuse and nontraditional forms. Last Monday, Niisato demonstrated his unique technique of creating the patterns on his ceramics with a drill and gave a presentation on his past works and artistic history at the Ceramics Studio, run by the Office for the Arts. Niisato’s work is currently on exhibition in Boston at the KEIKO Gallery. The exhibition, titled “Luminous Vessels,” opened last Saturday and will run through May 4. Keiko Fukai, the owner and director of the gallery, opened the space in 2003 to showcase contemporary Japanese art, hosting about nine different exhibitions a year. Interested in promoting Niisato’s work in the U.S., she invited him to exhibit at her gallery.“I contacted Akio about three years ago to ask him if I could exhibit some of his smaller pieces in my gallery,” Fukai says. “Akio is extremely famous in Japan and is one of the most promising new artists in the country. Everybody knows him.”The “sweet and talented young artist,” as described by Fukai, found his passion for ceramics at an early age. “I began studying ceramics while I was in high school but attended college as a Philosophy and Literature major,” Niisato said through a translator during an interview. “I joined a ceramic art club as a hobby but found that my passion was too strong to resist and left school at the age of 21 to attend a special training school. I graduated in 2001 and have been creating my own work ever since.”Each of Niisato’s works is extremely unique, both in their shapes and the patterns imprinted on each one. During the presentation, Niisato demonstrated his approach. He first thinned out a rough shape of a vessel from which to create a more delicate shape; then he drew lines around the vessel with a traditional Japanese calligraphy pen, tilting his work on the wheel to create different patterns. As he did this, he explained that often he draws these lines freehanded, but sometimes he conceives of a pattern, such as a flower, beforehand. Once he outlined the patterns he wanted, Niisato carefully drilled holes along the lines he had made, using differently sized drill bits depending on what size holes he wished to create. The distances between the holes gave the appearance of having been measured with a ruler, but, in reality, Niisato determined the precise distances using only his eye. After completing the demonstration, he told his audience that he often fires his vessels almost four times in the kiln, and between each firing, he covers them with a traditional glaze to fill in the holes. Before developing the artistic ceramic technique that Niisato demonstrated last Monday, he created pieces designed for everyday use, like painted ceramic cups and bowls. But the exhibition in Boston consists of works that are not for everyday use and are instead to be viewed as pieces of art. Because of the influence of his professors at his special training school, Niisato finds it extremely important to have a balance between traditional Japanese ceramics as useful objects and as art. He continues to make more practical vessels as well as art pieces. “I am inspired by the history and tradition of the Japanese ceramic arts,” Niisato said. “I push myself to be the successor of hundreds of years of history, and I see myself as both an extension and a frontrunner of ceramic art in Japan.”The glowing nature of Niisato’s work gives the large variety of sizes and shapes amongst his works a similarly striking beauty. His collection features pieces shaped like practical bowls and cups, slightly misshapen variations of practical vessels made to seem more artistic in nature, and more creative shapes that Niisato calls his “experiments.” The breadth of his collection may not seem to have one single meaning, but Niisato does know what he wants the audience to take away from his creations. “Through my work, it’s hard to say definitely what I am trying to convey, but I want to express my passion for ceramics to the viewer,” Niisato said. “I want the viewer to have their own experience with the work as a piece of art and for that experience to change with them through time. Other than that, I think my work speaks better for itself than I speak for it.”Although he has won international awards at competitions such as the International Ceramic Festival in 2008, Niisato is looking forward to extending his work into the U.S. while keeping true to his traditional Japanese ceramic style.“My intention is to expand my style into the future,” Niisato said, “to let people in the United States know about the history of ceramic art, and to foster a further interest and understanding of the style and history of Japanese ceramic art.”

“I think the easiest description—or category to put us in—would be a jazz group,” says The Bad Plus drummer, David King. “But a more accurate description, if you really wanted to get pompous, is that we do music of novelty.” The band, which incorporates various techniques and multiple genres into its musical selection, transcends the classification of being simply a jazz group. Comprised of King, bassist Reid Anderson, and pianist Ethan Iverson, The Bad Plus will be performing at the Berklee Performance Center this evening as a part of a national tour promoting their most recent album, “For All I Care.”The group exudes an energy that truly attests to the trio’s jazz roots. “Jazz has spread in so many different ways over the course of its existence,” King says. “I feel like we’re part of the jazz canon, because we are improvisers first and foremost.”But jazz isn’t the defining element of The Bad Plus, whose latest album features both original tracks and a number of covers, including renditions of Pink Floyd’s “Comfortably Numb” and Igor Stravinsky’s “Variations d’Apollon,” a 20th century classical piano piece. “We rework rock music, we play original music, we play classical music, we score for dance, we’ve got music for fashion,” King says. “We’re interested in boundary-less influence. And we try to take it and filter it through this sound of The Bad Plus. So I think our story’s a little more complex than a jazz trio.”The history of the band’s sound is as layered as their influences. King and Anderson, who have known each other for over 25 years, first bonded over the song “Rock & Roll Band” by the rock band Boston. They played together with Iverson for the first time in 1990, and though the trio went their separate ways throughout the 90s, they kept in touch. “We needed the 90s to gestate, develop our own personalities as musicians and improvisers,” King says. “It was interesting, because we were in our own bands, we were putting out our own records and getting things here and there, but it was only when we came together that it really popped for us. We realized there was something special between the three of us.” By the start of this century, the three members had fully committed to The Bad Plus. In the past, the band has interpreted songs by Nirvana, the Pixies, Neil Young, and Interpol, among other rock groups. In “For All I Care,” released in February of this year, The Bad Plus incorporates classical music into their repertoire for the first time. “We wanted to approach [classical music] differently and have it be the sound of The Bad Plus—kind of cerebral, intense, contemporary classical music. It was a new challenge, a new tool. We wanted to see what would happen, and it started to really work,” King says. “We’ve been playing it live every night, and it’s really fun to add that into our original music and some of the rock pieces.”The Bad Plus also experimented with a vocalist, Wendy Lewis, in their most recent album. “It’s part of the jazz tradition to mess with instrumentation,” King says. “So we thought, why don’t we go all the way and get a vocalist?”The trio knew from the first, however, that they needed a very specific kind of vocalist—someone who would accommodate the existing sound of The Bad Plus while bringing another element to the music. “There’s a record by John Coltrane called ‘John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman’ where the Coltrane Quartet brings in a singer,” says King. “It’s one of our favorite records….Their sound was still intact—it just had vocals. We wanted to bring in a singer that was more of an ensemble member and not a big jazz diva.”King hopes that the concert at the Berklee Performance Center will be a testament to their versatility, diversity, and ability to incorporate the sound of The Bad Plus across many genres. “We open the show with the trio, we do some original music, we do some contemporary classical music from the new record,” says King. “And we bring out Wendy and [continue to] tear it apart. We try to do everything with the same energy. It’s very cool.”

While reading “Death in Spring,” Mercè Rodoreda’s final work, it is easy to forget how unlikely the publication of the book is. In Francisco Franco’s anti-Catalan Spain, Rodoreda faced not only suppression and exile but the extinction of her native language. Under Franco, Catalan’s very existence was threatened, banned outright in the public sphere and severely curtailed in the private sphere. In this context, while translations of Spanish language novels achieved worldwide fame and renown in the 1970s and 1980s, Catalan writers remained obscure, even after Franco’s death in 1975, when the ban on Catalan was lifted. With her translation of “Death in Spring,” Martha Tennent hopes to begin to redress this historic injustice.  How deeply unfortunate, then, that the novel itself cannot live up to the promise of a hidden classic. A brief work of only 150 pages, told in dense four-page episodes, “Death in Spring” creates a world at once strange and familiar: a nameless town characterized by brutal, gratuitous violence and the prevalence of the bizarre, narrated through an unusual set of eyes—those of a teenage boy. Rodoreda’s narrator is a remarkably dispassionate protagonist, remarking in turns on the macabre and the surreal with unflinching ambivalence.Comparison is impossible to resist, as Rodoreda chooses to pitch her tent so deliberately close to that of other writers. The allegory of Rodoreda’s novel is glaringly reminiscent of its more renowned contemporary, J.M. Coetzee’s “Waiting for the Barbarians.” Whereas Coetzee uses myth to provide an account of nobility in the midst of brutality—itself a critique of South African apartheid—Rodoreda’s rootless fantasy world communicates comparatively little of Coetzee’s allegorical power. Through the unnamed narrator, Rodoreda implements an emotionally stripped style as a stand-in for wanton horror: “The blacksmith did not want me to entomb my child in the tree. He said he would use the ring for some other dead person. I left home, carrying my child, who had turned wooden, like the table.” As originally conceived, this device is supposed to amplify an effect by presenting it in an unusual or grotesque way. The offhand presentation of violence and brutality certainly constitutes a form of defamiliarization, but the effect, conversely, is to sap the book of any real emotional power. Such descriptions abound in the novel in a flat, monotonous way, and the purely grotesque, after intense repetition, has neither comic nor dramatic value.  Thus even those scenes which ought to be most powerful have little impact, as with the death of Senyor, a character of focus for some odd pages: “The blacksmith gave the word for the cement man to commence; they forced open Senyor’s mouth and began to fill it. Senyor’s eyes were bulging; his chest rose twice as he retched.” This would be gruesome enough if such descriptions did not exist in virtually every passage of the novel. What comes next is more unusual. One old woman, refusing to spit on and insult Senyor on his death bed, instead closes the dying man’s eyes so that he does not witness his own humiliation. This ought to be a moment of profound pathos. But in the midst of the barrage of grotesque images, its matter-of-fact account scarcely registers.  Perhaps the novel’s greatest weakness is its inability to truly create characters. Leave aside the enigmatic narrator; the other characters in the book exist only as prose descriptions, devoid of any psychological complexity or, even, thought. This is not typically a genre convention of the mythic allegory, and it greatly hampers Rodoreda’s attempt at the creation of a satisfying fictional universe. Whether the novel’s emotional gap is a result of Tennent’s translation or Rodoreda original work, other aspects of the novel are simply inaccessible to readers outside the Catalan culture. Recurring images and motifs are, for the same reason, often mysterious. What is the significance of “wisteria” to the author? We are treated to images of wisteria flowers after wisteria flowers, even a “wisteria-laden night,” but any particular import this image may have had in Catalan is sadly incomprehensible to the English reader. And this is just one of several ways in which “Death in Spring” is a deeply frustrating book. It works so well in theory: an allegorical representation of Franco’s Spain, a kind of literary “Pan’s Labyrinth,” complete with maniacal teenaged stepmothers and vicious town rituals, not to mention the dimension created by the book’s publishing history. But coming out of such an intriguing background, this is a thin novel in every sense of the word.

The modern literary tradition—in particular, the Lost Generation writers and their contemporaries—has done something curious in romanticizing the throes of alcoholism. Hemingway, Faulkner and Fitzgerald were all raging alcoholics and filled their novels with characters who acted likewise. But never before, and rarely today, does a novelist confront addiction so intimately and personally as Jerzy Pilch in his recently translated novel, “The Mighty Angel.”A darkly humorous, yet undeniably serious, look into the life of a repeatedly relapsing alcoholic (also named Jerzy) and his recovering brethren in and out of rehab comes as no great surprise from one of Poland’s most celebrated writers. “The Mighty Angel” cemented Pilch’s reputation, earning him Poland’s NIKE Literary Award in 2001. It was well-deserved. Pilch unflinchingly confronts the emotional reality of alcoholism and suggests a more sobering reality beyond sobriety.It’s unclear for whom the narrative is intended. As the narrator, Jerzy speaks to himself, speaks to his lover, speaks to himself again (this time sober), speaks to the girl in the yellow dress, and—it seems—speaks to us as well. In his own words, he is “writing about you and [he’s] writing about [himself] not only to show that true alcoholic prose does not end in death; it ends in life, and who knows how life will end.” His ambivalence towards alcohol abuse—and, for that matter, toward any direction for his life in general—composes the novel’s substance. This ambiguity forces Jerzy to face a constant struggle: “...therapists are striving to bring reality to the point of sobriety, whereas I’m striving to bring reality to the point of literature, and at a certain moment our paths inevitably diverge.”Pilch calls on the words of writers and thinkers like Leibnitz, Dostoevsky, Nabokov and Kierkegaard to answer his existential questions. But he hesitates to analyze his own life as an alcoholic, and he uses the stories of his fellow addicts instead: Don Juan the Rib, The Most Wanted Terrorist in the World, the Sugar King, the Queen of Kent, the Hero of Socialist Labor, and various other minor characters. Despite a dense population and a strangely episodic narrative framework, each of Pilch’s characters reads as an emotional mirror; their struggles with alcoholism map a microcosm of the struggles of the human experience. Pilch seems to suggest that rehabilitation is an experience akin to religious purgation, or even experience in combat, referring to the time before and after as “civilian life.” Jerzy’s addiction even finds a human counterpart in the form of his obsession with the mysterious poet Alberta Lulaj, “the girl in a yellow dress.”  Pilch’s memoir-like style blends black comedy, amateur psychology, and homage to Homeric epithet, like “Don Juan the Rib, in civilian life a hairdresser, and additionally, a musician.” Epithets like this one, while routine, help define the characters as much for Jerzy as they do for the reader. But as it turns out, the validity of their stories is uncertain; Jerzy stakes his position in the rehabilitation center by retelling (or rather, recreating) the lives of the various alcoholics. A typical truck driver becomes the Most Wanted Terrorist in the World; a hairdresser and musician becomes Don Juan the Rib; and a particularly religious patient becomes the reincarnation of John the Baptist.In his mind, alcohol is Jerzy’s muse; as long as he drinks he will have material to write. Jerzy takes no time to avoid drinking again after leaving the center; he hails a cab to the bar whose title the novel bears. But the Mighty Angel is a name that Jerzy attributes to his love as well—the elusive girl in the yellow dress. The question arises whether this angel, this manifold savior, is just as fragile and just as fraught as the alcoholics that worship it. While Jerzy seems to have escaped this cycle of rehabilitation and relapse by the novel’s end, the reader is left to wonder whether its only a matter of time before he regresses again. His fascination with this cycle, with its own sobering reality, perhaps as much as his own addiction, almost goes as far as to guarantee his return: “Even now they believe they won’t drink anymore; they’re profoundly convinced they’ll never drink another glass in their lives. They promised themselves this in all honesty. Naturally, they’re incapable of it… Sooner or later the talons of addiction tighten around their thirsty throats.”So, the real outcome is left to our speculation. Jerzy tells us, “I was ruled by my tongue. I was ruled by women. I was ruled by alcohol.” In the end, Jerzy admits to his sobriety and owns his mistakes and successes: “...to my credit was my despair; to my credit were my prayers, and to my credit is my love.” But ultimately more intriguing is Jerzy’s mental block on the question of alcohol and the nagging doubt that this lack of resolution instills in the affixed reader: “…in my case especially it’s impossible, to live a long and happy life when you drink. But how can you live a long and happy life if you don’t drink?”

While mental trauma and war often go hand in hand, no one has ever quite approached the subject as Jakov Lind does in his novel, “Landscape in Concrete.” The surprisingly entrancing and fantastical story follows shellshocked ex-Nazi sergeant Gauthier Bachman as he tries to find a battalion after his own is decimated at Voroshenko. On his way, Bachmann meets an array of fairytale-like characters stuffed into military uniforms, and he embarks on a series of strange, allegorical adventures. He is, for the most part, unaware of his mental illness, but Lind’s deft portrayals of both Bachmann’s condition and his defiant denial in the face of it constitute a disturbing and poignant undercurrent to the events of the novel.The dreamlike quality of the novel emanates from Lind’s ability to create sparse but symbolic landscapes and to fill them with characters whose simple exteriors incapsulate deeper historical echoes. Of course, the enchanting essence of the story is much more akin to that of the original Grimm stories than their doe-eyed Disney counterparts (it revolves around shocking wartime occurrences) but Lind’s gift for eccentric descriptions of characters and events transforms the more gruesome and explicit scenes into something strangely pallatable. Lind’s descriptions endow the starved, inhuman, and ruthless characters of the war with unreal qualities that make the whole narrative easier to digest.  Ironically, this seemingly simplistic, almost whimsical lens allows Lind to humanize the effect of the war on people. For instance, Bachmann meets a deserter named Schnotz, who has become so much like a woodland creature as a result of his time away from human company that Bachmann initially doesn’t even recognize him physically as a human: “[Bachmann] hauled off and poked his stick into the ghost’s side. It writhed with pain and made faces. You’ve hurt my kidney, the critter whimpered.” Though the reader and Bachmann eventually learn that Schnotz was once just as inhuman a soldier as he is now a woodland critter, Schnotz’s Gollum-like wildness emphasizes his pathetic fall from the military, society, and humanity.  In addition, Lind captures his subjects with kind of dual childishness and precision; in sketching the form of Bachmann’s girlfriend Helga, he writes, “Before their eyes stood a Valkyrie in a short blue dress, disclosing stout calves and powerful knees that gave promise of heavenly thighs… Her breasts were bigger than the legendary blue mountains and just as unlikely, her bottom was as round as a terrestrial globe.” In doing so, Lind persuades the reader to see the world more and more through Bachmann’s eyes as he stumbles about in a mental haze, taking in objects and people like a perverted man-child.  This fantastical, enchanted narrative, however, proves difficult to sustain. Lind begins to lose a little of his earlier momentum in the second half of the novel, particularly as Bachmann encounters even more cruel people and more frightening situations. Bachmann’s dogged persistence in finding a battalion is also aimless and repetitive, and while this is undoubtedly a result of his mental trauma, Lind could have given Bachmann’s earlier history or perhaps more details about the onset of his condition in order to help the reader appreciate his current state. Towards the end of the novel, the otherworldly charm of the opening chapters gives way to a metallic surrealism, interspersed with forced philosophical conversations about the existence of God and what it means to be man.  In some rare moments, Lind weaves a new kind of poetry, one blended with religion, philosophy, and Bachmann’s own sensitivity. After being picked up by a peacetime school teacher who hires Bachmann as an assassin, Bachmann pauses to urinate by the side of the road: “With birdie in hand, he looked up at the stars. Eternity, eternity, said a Nietzschean murmur within him, how big you are! O starlight that floods the cosmos (his arc grew shorter and shorter)! Heaven and earth, clouds and space! said Bachmann aloud. Not so loud! Halftan called.” These are the moments when Bachmann’s personal experiences of the war and his mental trauma become beautiful and disturbing without dwelling on the historical, social, or political context.   While the latter half of the novel lacks the imagination of the former, it is rich in historical anecdotes, not only about the Germans and Nazis, but also the foreigners who worked alongside them, and what they thought about the war. As Bachmann’s mental state deteriorates, so does the language of novel, and by the end, Lind mires his characters in a bog of metaphors and fleshy images. It is ultimately Lind’s subtle touch that renders this kind of stagnant illness and sparse landscape unique and full, and his grace as a writer that transforms the atrocities of war into poignant and stirring depictions of human nature pushed to its limit.—Staff writer Jenny J.

I would’ve bolted right then.  Except Ezekiel said, just as I tried to get away, “I hope it’s a nice time, Miss Winnie.”Something about it—about that patient face of his—made me so mad.  Mad in the way you get when someone elbows you in the eye but says it’s an accident.  It wasn’t anyone’s fault that that stray brick had messed up Ezekiel’s ear.  But that didn’t mean he was defunct. And even if he was a Negro, it was still such a waste:  that this man, whose family was “away” (dead), was about to just toss out his Easter.Before I could even think to be scared I said, “Why don’t you just come sit with me and Daddy.  We’re up real close so you shouldn’t have a problem hearing.”His smile deflated. He eyed me like I’d told him you could light your lamp with apple tea.  “That’s real nice, Miss Winnie, but I don’t think so.”“Well.”  I tried to stop my carriage as it flew down the hill.  “Well, you know, the sermon has already started, so everybody will be paying attention to that.  You won’t be taking anyone’s seat.”  Thou shalt not lie.“Miss Winnie, I’s not goin’ to rile anybody up today.”“You wouldn’t be—you won’t!”  Thou shalt not bear false witness.  “And if even if you did upset your friends, my father wouldn’t have any of the Negroes talking.”  My father would kill me.  (Thou shalt not kill?)Ezekiel’s eyes tapered.  “It ain’t my friends that’d be upset.”I rushed past the insult.  “I think anyone would be upset if they knew you were out here, missing the service.  You might not be real comfy in our pew.  But only ’cause it’d be full.  And that’s never hurt anyone.  Right?”I didn’t believe me.  There was no way he did.  And yet it was all his polite face could do not to quiver at the thought of refusing me.  I could see it grinding through his head—how to serve the employer of his daughter if his employer’s daughter was disobeying his employer.Ezekiel!  I can’t go back there alone!Stop it.  Stop it, you coward.  Let it go.  For all our decencies. But then Ezekiel said, “I won’t take somebody’s seat.”Doubt bloomed in my chest.  Like a big swallow of cordial.“I ain’t goin’ to make somebody move.  Am I?”“No,” I could barely say.  “Of course not.”  He couldn’t really be considering it.  Could he?“I would only do it this one time.”“Yes.”  Oh, no.“It would be such a fine thing, since it’s Easter and all.”Now I could only nod.Winnie.  You have to stop this.  You can’t let him do this.  They’ll kill him.Will they, though?  Of course not.  Wasn’t it a bunch of Northerners in there?  Wasn’t this the sort of thing they loved?It’s a good thing he took charge, directing my dazed hide to the doors.  Otherwise I would’ve stood in the lobby for the rest of my life.  Stunned by my great idiocy.  The idiocy of rightdoing through wrongdoing.  He shook his head with a smile.  “Our Lord is risen.”  He was clutching the handles, mashing their cool to his palms.  And then he was pulling.The weighty oaks wrenched back.  The congregation spilled into view:  a vista of judgment.  Ezekiel’s arms spread wide, arcing as they stretched to their tips.  He turned his head and motioned me in.My left knee gave out but he stayed put.“You got it?”“Yes.”I stumbled as I snuck beneath his arm.  Then I was using the hymnal to smooth my dress out. He was next to me, watching me, serious.  “Miss Winnie?”  The doors drifted shut behind us.“Yes, let’s go.”I’d really tried to act right since Trent had died—if only for Daddy.  And I think I’d made a fine stab at propriety.  But as we took our first, doomed steps I couldn’t help thinking this was the last time:  who would I visit after this?  I was sure the Northerners hated me because I was a Southerner and now the Southerners would hate me because I was a Northerner.“Miss Winnie,” Ezekiel whispered.  “You don’t look right.”“No, I just—I think I’m about to sneeze.”  I stopped, took another breath, jammed my palms to the top of each cheek.  Don’t you dare release a thing, eyes.I nodded back at him.  “I’m fine.”“What’s ’at?”“I’m fine.”He leaned in. Of course.  His good ear was on the other side.  Even this close he couldn’t hear. Then he bent in even more, just waiting for me to speak.  Eyes wide.  So patient. He finally said, “We can sit with the Negroes if you want.”“No.”No, sir.  You will hear Reverend Lewis’s sermon today.  Even if it’s the rankest cow paddy that’s ever dropped out of a pulpit. I waved him forward. He waved me forward. I said, “After you.”He said, “You know where we’s goin’.”Do I?Yes.  You have to.  I took a breath.  It wasn’t enough.  I took another one!Then I took off.  I charged.  If I slowed I would stop.  I thought I heard Ezekiel,  somewhere to my side, limping with doubt.  But I kept to my stride.  And soon he caught up.It wasn’t long before we fell into some sort of rhythm.  By the time we’d passed those first few pews, we’d agreed on a kind of swaying tack that shuffled us across the wood.  The shuffling became a skimming and that gave me enough of a gliding feel to not slow when I heard, from the Negro section, some Hallelujahs and a Holy Deliverer.  I’m sure the cries were cried for The Creator but Ezekiel seemed to think they could be for us, too.  He turned to his people, just halfway, still not sure if he should smile or ask forgiveness.Sooner than I’d’ve thought came jerks and pants from the white folks.  Usually I’d feel them break after I’d passed, but a few times they’d bubble up in front of me:  heads turning round to scowl and simmer.  The rustling of these early birds soon joined up with the clamoring hiss behind us—a legion of cicadas, banging away on their timbals as they crept at our heels.It’s a good thing I was getting numb.  Because the din finally got so bad that Reverend Lewis stopped talking.  It was just for a second, but he looked right at me, all the way from up on high.  I was finally ready to faint.  But Ezekiel kept going as the reverend looked back up and said “Please” to the congregation before continuing.I got to the pew and saw Daddy turn.  His face was healthy for one moment and then, just like the reverend’s, it went dead.I stood there dumb.  But Ezekiel was waiting.  This was my domain.I looked down at Old Man Grumpy.  He turned slowly, like he was so enthralled with the sermon that my return was some big surprise.  I tried to give him a look that would get him to scooch over.  But he moved his body an inch then looked back to the pulpit.A thousand eyes were watching me, and all he could do was make enough room for a piece of toast?  Not many things could have pumped me from that horrible way I felt but this was one of them. So I stepped from the aisle, tried to sit in that sliver, and then whacked the man with my hips until he and all his friends from Crotchety Incorporated moved it down.  The racket had lost some of its heat by the time Ezekiel sat. I was busy looking for the best place to vomit, to vomit for no other reason than to get rid of something I felt but didn’t really know—impatience?  Was that impatience sloshing around in me?  Yes, I felt a throw up coming on, but then something stabbed me.  In the leg.Was Old Man Grumpy jabbing me in the thigh?  When I looked down I saw nothing.  But I lifted my bottom just a smidge (not caring a flip now if I drew attention) and pulled up what was below me:  my hymnal!  I’d forgotten I’d even been carrying it.Now I took it, clasped it tight with both hands.  And as I looked up I couldn’t help smirking real big.  The queasies let up some but they were still trotting around my insides.  One of them stopped, though.  Stopped real sudden.  Stayed put right in my middle.I felt a grin sprout up, and it kept on growing.  And it was then I had to wonder if this nasty thing I felt wasn’t impatience but expectation.

“Bromst,” the second full-length, commercially distributed album by Dan Deacon, should come with a Surgeon General’s Warning. Deacon’s noisy arrangements are sure to cause headaches, blow out eardrums, and send true indie-electronic fans into a blissful state of sensory overload. This bundle of noise is, surprisingly, the Baltimore-based musician’s most accessible album to date. After six years and numerous independently-released records, Deacon appears to have realized that a few tracks with vocals and clear pop melodies can increase an album’s popularity—even hipsters enjoy the occasional sing-along session. Like Deacon’s previous work, “Bromst” is still primarily instrumentally driven, but his sound has evolved into something catchier, lighter, and ultimately more inviting.“Build Voice,” the album’s opener, begins with a grating, repetitive drone which eventually becomes the backbone of the entire track. After your ears adjust to the initial irritation, however, it somehow morphs into an undeniably musical sound. The same drone is no longer unsettling noise but an oscillation between two notes with a clear, pounding rhythm driving the music forward. The sound is no longer the drone of bees or an overcrowded city street, but of horns, drums, keyboards, and a true composer.Much of the album evokes the same reaction as the opening track. Songs begin with a noise that shocks you out of your comfort zone, causes your body to twitch a bit in response to such strong dissonance, and forces your hand to resist the urge to press next. Even if the songs aren’t initially easy on the eardrums, they are curious and compelling in their unraveling. None of Deacon’s tracks stands still for too long. They either escalate into an explosion of energy or abruptly change course, always keeping the listener on the edge of his seat. This anticipation inevitably elicits a strong reaction—whether you love or hate a Deacon song, you can be sure you feel something when listening to it.Not all of “Bromst,” however, inspires some mix of either uncomfortable or appreciative emotions. There are a few tracks on the album that are exceptions to the “irritating yet intriguing” rule. “Wet Wings,” which begins within an a capella canon of whiny female voices saying “D-Day is passed and gone,” never leaves the realm of “irritating” and simply dissolves into an incoherent mess of vocal sound, leaving us to wonder if the introduction of vocals was really such a great idea. Others, such as “Slow With Horns / Run for Your Life” and “Surprise Stefani,” skip the initial, unsettling irritation and open with an already pleasant, natural-sounding progression of identifiable instruments and chords. While this album may be generally formulaic in its chaotic buildup of sound, it is apparent that Deacon knows quite well how successful his formula is. He has come to embrace a more mainstream pop aesthetic, which ultimately serves him well, but his sound remains decidedly irreverent, keeping him true to his roots. This balance ensures that “Bromst” marks Deacon’s successful shift towards more conventional techniques without any resulting loss of artistic integrity.

A young woman traveling through the Taiga, a shapeshifting animal who just happens to be her lover, a forest queen, and a crude and brutal rake— surprisingly, these characters are not out of a medieval fable. Instead, they are central elements of “The Hazards of Love,” the new concept album from indie favorites The Decemberists. The 17-song rock opera never stops plowing forward from the second it begins, with a mix of folk and in-your-face heavy metal that makes it one of the most inventive folk-rock albums in recent memory. Some songs do not succeed beyond their role as fragments of the melodramatic plot. But when the album is viewed as one cohesive folk-rock project, it acts as a bold statement of the band’s ambition.While the Portland-based band’s previous album, “The Crane Wife,” showcased frontman Colin Meloy’s affinity for lyrical storytelling, “The Hazards of Love,” the band’s fifth studio recording, takes these inclinations to an entirely new level. An hour-long saga of compelling fury that demands to be listened to in its entirety, it follows the story of a young woman named Margaret as she falls in love with a shapeshifting faun named William whom she meets in the forest.  In four acts, an evil queen and a villainous rake try to destroy the couple, but these hazards only succeed in ending their lives, not their love. Beginning with a slow organ crescendo that leads into Meloy’s somber introduction in the first variation of a recurring “Hazards of Love” track, the first act progresses into bombastic power chords as Margaret enters the treacherous forest. The second act adds a reprise of “The Hazards of Love” through the eyes of her love William. The album reaches a peak with “The Wanting Comes in Waves/Repaid,” as William is confronted by the evil queen. Using the leitmotifs from the previous songs, the later half of the album describes the rake character and the abduction of Margaret until she and her lover find peace in death at the album’s conclusion.Full of recurring motif variations and the numerous interludes, “The Hazards of Love” is best enjoyed as the sum of its parts, but its individual peaks are manifold. With its creative mix of styles, “Annan Water” is multifaceted enough to be able to fit eloquently into the overall theme and still function effectively as a self-contained statement. As the rhythmic bellows of the accordion and the acoustic guitar in the verse suddenly stop to make way for a chorus of singers accompanied by organ, the song gains a sense of completion and cohesion that some of the other tracks lack. It ends on an unexpected minor chord, setting the stage for the cut that follows.Later, “The Hazards of Love 4 (The Drowned)” acts as a cathartic reflection on the album as a whole, seeming to emerge out of the rubble into a climactic and chaotic narrative finale, describing the peace that Margaret and her lover William find in a watery death. The grand instrumentation, complete with the accompaniment of lofty strings and a steel guitar solo, work to create this sense of closure. The pensive nature of the song as a mournful yet serene ending to the album is truly expressed as harmonies sung by the other characters are added on top of Meloy’s grief-stricken melody.Several songs are not as versatile as the aforementioned cuts, contrivances seemingly designed only to set up a given mood, build the suspense, or introduce a new character. For instance, “A Bower Scene” consists of a single guitar riff that seems to be more like a long introduction to the next song to come. With its thumping power chords that build and regress, the track is designed only to give the story a treacherous feel and create tension as the narrative begins. When it eventually erupts into a bombastic heavy metal motif of the next cut or is repeated later on in the CD, the song’s necessity to the album as a whole becomes apparent as it effectively creates the suspense needed to drive the story forward. The Decemberists deserve enormous credit for “The Hazards of Love.” They have created a unified work of musical art centered on a single story whose use of recurring themes, reliance on the striking contrast between balladry and heavy metal, and classic storytelling have allowed it to work as a whole. Several of the songs serve only to signify scene changes, build on character development, or establish a certain atmosphere, but the production in its entirety succeeds in expanding the limits of what modern folk-rock albums can be.

If you were conscious and paying at least some passing attention to popular culture in 2006 or 2007, chances are you remember the infectious whistled hook and pitter-patter bongos of Peter Bjorn and John’s “Young Folks.”  Its innate cuteness won enough hearts to pass into mainstream consciousness and catapult the Swedish trio to relative renown.  Its sheer ubiquity was perhaps best revealed when Kanye West remixed it on his mixtape “Can’t Tell Me Nothing.”  PB&J followed up the success of “Young Folks” with a couple pleasant but unmemorable diversions: an album of instrumentals called “Seaside Rock” and frontman Peter Morén’s surprisingly vapid solo debut “The Last Tycoon.” In January, the band’s return-to-form was announced by none other than Kanye, who introduced the first single from PB&J’s fifth studio album, “Living Thing,” on his blog.  The bumptious auteur gloated, “THEY SENT THE SONG TO ME FIRST!” and went on to wax lyrically, “DRUMS ARE CRAZY AND I LIKE THE KIDS ON THE HOOK.” Kanye is totally right.  “Nothing to Worry About” is contagious and compelling—all in all, a better song than “Young Folks.”  If only the rest of the songs on “Living Thing” had come close to matching the single’s riotous energy and imagination, we would have had a real winner on our hands. “Living Thing” starts off with the shimmering synths and brutal drum machine beats of opener “The Feeling.”  Spasmodic guitars and tidy handclaps round out the atmosphere.  “It Don’t Move Me” carries over the same handclaps, placing them over a piano riff borrowed from Björk’s “Human Behaviour.” Like PB&J’s last album, “Living Thing” is marked by propulsive and insistent percussion, but here the rhythm section is mixed even further to the forefront, often louder than the guitars or vocals. From the reverbed crashes of “Lay it Down,” evocative of chain-gang pick-axes, to the deeply resonating tribal drums on the dirge “4 out of 5,” the band’s meticulous attention to texture is evident in each of the twelve songs on “Living Thing.” Kanye’s caps-locked infatuation with the band is perhaps most understandable in the context of this new preoccupation with aural textures. However, “PB&J” often seems to mistake inventive production for good material. Every song on the album has interesting stylistic touches, but they frequently lack the melody and songwriting to come together into a coherent whole.  While it is admirable that PB&J take an active interest in the construction of their soundscapes, one wonders if they should have spent more time replicating the winning formula of “Young Folks” before they started tweaking the details.The band’s stylistic influences are diverse but perhaps at the sacrifice of coherence. “I Want You!” with its midtempo ambling New Wave guitar and echoed bass drum, sounds like an early U2 track, and the vocal and lyrical style and African-inflected bass of “Living Thing” directly channels Vampire Weekend’s watered-down “Graceland” vibe. As already established by Mr. West, “Nothing to Worry About” is an elation, a nearly perfectly-constructed hip-hop influenced indie-pop dance song with a nonsensical yet addicting chorus. “Lay it Down” marks the other high point of the record. With its jaunty tone and insolent chorus of “Hey, shut the fuck up boy / You’re starting to piss me off,” it acts as the stylistic twin to “Nothing to Worry About.” But just when you’re starting to join in on the rollicking angry energy, the song ends, and “Stay This Way” drags the whole mess down into plaintive misdirection as Morén sings “I don’t want to grow up / I don’t want to stay young” over a maddeningly meandering synth flute. “Blue Period Picasso” is narrated from, unsurprisingly, the point-of-view of a Blue period Picasso painting.  It is as bad as it sounds. Case in point: “But I’m not just being blue… It’s just a part of what I am / It’s just a part of my beating heart.” It turns out that PB&J are far weaker when gunning for clever or thoughtful than when they’re at their most crass and impudent.  This is where they seem to have the most fun and, in turn, where their music is the most fun to listen to.There’s not anything particularly offensive about most of these songs, but outside of “Lay it Down” and “Nothing to Worry About,” this album isn’t particularly interesting or memorable. Certainly, making a boring album is not the worst sin a band can commit, but Peter Bjorn & John have proven themselves capable of producing more exciting music than this.  In “The Feeling,” Peter Morén sings, “Been waiting for signs / Last time we got high we thought we had the puzzle worked out.” Maybe they should be doing some more stoned brainstorming, or maybe Kanye can help them out, but one hopes that Peter Bjorn & John start making the fine albums that their singles deserve.

“Sometimes I think that I’m bigger than the sound,” sang Karen O on “Cheated Hearts” from the Yeah Yeah Yeahs’ second album, “Show Your Bones.” If O, the leader of the New York trio, was previously afraid of overshadowing her bandmates—guitarist Nick Zinner and drummer Brian Chase—the massive shift that she directed for “It’s Blitz!” the band’s third album, would certainly not suggest so. On her orders, the band has dispensed with the frenetic guitar work that defined its first two LPs. Instead, Zinner, one of the most inventive guitarists of this decade, is reduced to playing mostly synthesizers in an attempt to create the dance music that O has demanded.Although it may seem surprising, “It’s Blitz!” is a brave and thrilling statement from a band that seems determined to push forward. It harks back in many ways to 80s bands like New Order and The Cure, who constantly shifted and developed their sound—something that few bands are brave enough to attempt. Leaving behind their rough garage rock origins, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs have created a shiny and well-produced album. The object may have been to produce dance music, but “It’s Blitz!” is good enough to move hearts and minds as well as bodies.Boldly, the band places the two best songs on the album right at the start. Opener “Zero” is the perfect introduction to their new direction. The song begins with synths bubbling under the surface of a drum machine and O’s vocals, but they gradually emerge out to the forefront, eventually bursting into joyous techno. “Zero” is ideal both as a lead single and as an album opener, offering immediate thrills while continuously building to higher levels of excitement.Track two, “Heads Will Roll,” is even more direct in delivering the dance music beloved of O. As she sings, “Off with your head / Dance ’til you’re dead / Heads will roll / On the floor,” multiple synth lines whirl, finally dropping out altogether to leave a drum beat reminiscent of LCD Soundsystem.Later tracks offer a more nuanced and diverse vision of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs’ new sound. “Skeletons” is a magisterial ballad that is remarkably gripping given its chilly atmospherics and unsettling percussion. The simple lyrics (no line is longer than three words) rely mostly on word association—“Fall asleep / Spin the sky / Skeleton me / Love don’t cry”—yet still manage to convey a vulnerable beauty.Given their previous work, it is not at all surprising that many of the lyrics on “It’s Blitz!” describe love and sex. At times, O delivers lines of barely disguised innuendo, such as “The beast that I lie beneath is coming in” in “Dull Life.” That track—one of the few songs that prominently features the otherwise downplayed guitar—comes at the midpoint of the album and is one of the album’s most immediately exciting songs. But despite the enthusiasm, the track feels slightly disappointing given its failure to advance on the work the band has done previously.In its second half, “It’s Blitz!” experiments with various sounds that, although not as successful as in the first half, offer an interesting insight into where the band might go next. “Dragon Queen” flirts a little too much with disco beats and is the sort of song that fans of the band may have feared would be produced by abandoning guitars in favor of keyboards. Fortunately, the closing duo, “Hysteric” and “Little Shadow,” ensure the album closes on a high. The former is surprisingly close in sound to the Yeah Yeah Yeahs’ career highlight “Maps,” offering a restrained but engaging tale of a relationship surviving on the brink. “Little Shadow” closes the album in a completely different fashion to the opening tracks. A triumph of atmosphere and lyrics rather than danceable beats, it offers definitive proof that the band has not forgotten the importance of subtle songwriting during their quest for a new direction. The move away from guitar rock may have terrified many of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs’ core fans, but, fortunately, “It’s Blitz!” is such a delight that it will assuage any of these fears. Though a massive change of direction, the band’s new sound feels just right and fits surprisingly well with what they have done before. Synth lines have always been present in the band’s output; songs like “Turn Into” and “Rich” in fact relied heavily on them. This element of the band’s sound has now simply been pushed to the forefront. “It’s Blitz!” therefore manages to be both a shocking and perfectly logical step forward for the trio.—Staff writer Chris R.

Hipster, gangster, intellectual, pop star—Kanye West never can quite decide which one he likes best. Now, finally, he seems to have figured out; in a kind of epiphany, Kanye decides that he’s all of these things, plus a painter— all too literally, a Renaissance man. “Knock You Down” begins and ends with Keri Hilson’s seemingly lifeless body falling slowly through the air, but neither this bizarre sight nor later shenanigans by Ne-Yo is any match for the Kanye Show. His act opens with him rapping about Louis Vuitton and Reebok, telling us to “keep rocking and keep knocking” and talking about hate on a plate—same old, same old, you say. Not quite—cut to Kanye and Hilson in a what is either a studio meant to look like an apartment or an apartment meant to look like a studio. I guess it’s a fitting setting for Kanye to pick up a brush and paint a portrait of Hilson as Cleopatra, which manages to look like neither.  Needless to say, fine art isn’t the currency of a hip-hop video, and Kanye’s Da Vinci act soon ends. What follows is some semblance of plot. Kanye broods, raves, and rants about Hilson’s new boo (Ne-Yo) and finally engages said boyfriend in a deathmatch of sorts—a staring contest. It’s certainly an unexpected beef, and Kanye’s glare, in particular, would strike terror into the heart of any four-year-old. But while Yeezy perfects his hard gaze, Ne-Yo and Hilson are busy working on pantomiming the lyrics to the song. It’s unclear whether Kanye or Ne-Yo wins the staring match, or whether this matters. But on whether Kanye is a Renaissance man, there can be no doubt; the proof is in this video.  —Keshava D. Guha

You wander into a bedroom teeming with stoned yet attractive partygoers. Ah, there’s Britney, complete with strategically tousled hair and her post-comeback “It’s Britney, bitch” stare.  Fast forward through a lot of lacy lingerie and variations on aforementioned stare and Britney delivers a pun almost worthy of the “gracias” / “grassy ass” wisecracks we sported during recess in 5th grade: “If You Seek Amy” / “F-U-C-K Me.” Ladies and gentlemen, this is surely pop songwriting at its finest.However she frames it – “gimme more,” “you’re toxic, I’m slipping under,” etc. – Britney wants some, and if she has to coordinate wiggling seductively, maintaining the trademark stare, and balancing on stilettos blooming with red roses to get some, so be it.  I mean, after all, “all of the boys and all of the girls are begging to if you seek Amy,” right?  Don’t worry if the wordplay is still taking a while to sink in, because Britney’s raunchy tutorial accommodates all tastes and learning styles: one pelvic thrust per beat in the chorus, repeated twice with Chippendale wannabes or curvy cheerleaders.Now the music mellows out in a haze of white and you think, “Oh God, she’s getting married again?” But no, it’s just Britney the Stepford Wife, apple pie in hand, stepping out with her J.Crew catalogue cut-out husband and walking the paparazzi down memory lane with that endearing “Oops! I did it again” smile. Seconds anyone?—Monica S. Liu

“We’re not like other people,” Claire Stenwick (Julia Roberts) tearfully announces to Ray Koval (Clive Owen). “Only you could understand me.” No, these characters aren’t supernatural or extra-terrestrial; they’re spies for the CIA and MI-6, respectively—fed up with their empty lives of artifice and loneliness. After a one-night stand in Dubai and a week of lovemaking in Rome two years later, they decide that they belong together and hatch an escape plan. All they need in the world is each other and a cool $40 million to finance their tastes in Italian hotels, beachfront villas, and flowing Moet. But this romantically simple end begets a series of complicated means as the two spies become increasingly entangled in the world of corporate espionage and counter-intelligence. Written and directed by Tony Gilroy, the writer behind the wildly successful “Bourne” trilogy, “Duplicity” delves into the grimy underbelly of the fierce competition between two rival pharmaceutical companies who hire Claire and Ray to pawn top-secret technological breakthroughs undercover. They’re going to con both companies. “You on one side, me on the other,” Claire schemes. “It’s perfect.” To ensure their future together, they devise a complex plan involving multiple passports and secret meetings, all meticulously thought-out and cleverly executed.In “Duplicity,” Gilroy ambitiously attempts to transcend the stereotypical spy thriller with a thoughtful minimalism that made his directorial debut “Michael Clayton,” so successful. He employs frequent flashbacks and chronological re-orderings that lend the film an enticing suspense. But unlike “Michael Clayton,” this film fails to address any of the moral or ethical dilemmas implicit in a plot involving spies, treachery, and corporate litigation—even after five mentally exhausting plot twists. Gilroy uses the same intelligent crime thriller formula as his “Bourne” trilogy, but “Duplicity” relies on neither car chases nor intricate fight scenes to provide its thrills. Instead it depends on countless moments of shocking deceptions. After the spies’ initial hook-up in Dubai, Claire drugs Ray and steals some top-secret Egyptian military codes. Despite the lack of careful choreography, high-tech gear, and explosions, Gilroy succeeds here in creating a high-stakes atmosphere of suspense and double-dealing. But although the plot twists are almost as absorbing as those found in “Bourne,” “Duplicity” has none of its novelty or conviction. While “Bourne” carefully develops layer upon layer of the protagonist’s character, “Duplicity” banks on the overdone spy archetype and a few flimsy love scenes to validate its guileful plot. The audience is supposed to assume that as spies, Claire and Ray jet glamorously around the world wearing stilettos and aviators but suffer internally from the effects of their constant double-dealing. Oftentimes they struggle to maintain faith even in each other. “Admit it,” Claire muses after testing Ray’s fidelity by planting her black lacy thong in his apartment. “You don’t trust me either.” The audience never really glimpses more than their spy-persona veneers, barring their love for each other—which is the only aspect of their characters that seems even remotely human or relatable. Their supposedly unique, passionate love is billed as the justification for all their scheming, but their lackluster pairing is too implausible to substantiate that claim. While Claire and Ray’s love story spans five years and three continents, their few romantic scenes together fizzle. Both Owen and Roberts are sex icons in their own right, even if the latter seems slightly miscast as a young, seductive globetrotter. But if the audience is to believe that the goal of all their missions is really to overcome the complications of life undercover that keep Owens’ sexy British accent and Roberts’ ample post-pregnancy cleavage apart, then their on-screen chemistry had better sizzle—or at least feel tangible. The layers of intrigue and double-crossing in “Duplicity” are undoubtedly clever and thrilling—at first. But if Claire and Ray barely trust each other, can the viewer trust either of them? After the audience has been duped for the third, fourth, fifth, time, what’s the point? Gilroy has once again flexed his directorial skill and attention to detail, but this fails to compensate for the film’s lack of character development and moral complexity.

“Hunger” is marked by a series of strange and unsettling sequences shot over what feels like painful amounts of time. In one such scene, the camera rests for a good two minutes on a prison inmate as he watches a fly crawl across his arm. In lesser hands these moments could be rendered meaningless and dull, but McQueen’s film instead uses this minimalist aesthetic to transcend a simple set of plot details. In its depiction of real-life events, “Hunger” falls in an innovative category between straightforward documentary and dramatized historical epic. Much of the movie resembles visual art rather than film, eschewing dialogue and reportage for a haunting, gruesome, and powerful display of images. Most of the British-born McQueen’s work has been experimental. Famous for his silent films and small gallery projections, he dropped out of  New York University’s Tisch School of Arts because he felt the teaching restricted his experimental aspirations. Now it seems McQueen has found success in this artistic attempt at relaying the famed story of the Irish Republican Army’s hunger strike in the early 1980s.“Hunger” follows the group of prisoners at Ireland’s Her Majesty’s Prison Maze that demanded basic human rights in jail—such as the freedom to wear their own clothes, receive one visit a week from a family member, and organize recreational activities amongst themselves.  Though the inmates first attempted a “no wash” strike, their demands were not met until Bobby Sands (Michael Fassbender, “Band of Brothers”) led a hunger strike in 1981, ending successfully seven months later after the deaths of 10 men. The film has three major movements: scenes of the prisoners’ daily lives in the Maze, a long conversation between Sands and a priest, and the slow deterioration of Sands’ body. Within these three parts, the simplicity of the plot gains striking power from the horrifying images onscreen. Without warning, McQueen immediately throws the viewer into the depths of the prisoner’s “no wash” protest, portraying unwashed, unshaven men smearing their excrement on the walls of their cells. Lengthy, uneventful scenes evoke the empty hours the prisoners experience in jail—time wasted away in their disgusting dungeons of protest. McQueen’s attention to detail creates an arresting immediacy. He does not toy with the viewer’s emotions; rather he demands that the audience be repulsed, distressed, and deeply moved.After these visceral shocks, McQueen moves in the film’s second part to a lengthy conversation between Sands and his longtime friend, Father Lohan (Liam Cunningham, “The Wind That Shakes the Barley”). Here, as in the rest of the film, McQueen withholds no information from his audience, instead using Lohan to clarify the straightforward events of the plot. Sands’ death is inevitable; there are no plot twists or surprises in the film.  In a startlingly long and still scene, Lohan interrogates Sands, questioning his sanity after years in prison, his appreciation of his own life, and the likelihood that he will go through with starvation before his demands are met. The rest of the scene provides an opportunity for Sands to boldly state his dedication to the protests.  “You call it suicide; I call it murder,” he tells his friend, and with this, the film once again embraces wordlessness for its final chapter.The images in this third movement provide an uncensored and nauseating display of the deterioration of a human body without nourishment. McQueen documents the constant attention given to Sands by the hospital doctors as he refuses all food and gradually surrenders his body. McQueen, much like Sands, has a single and purposeful intention from which he never strays. Refusing to either condemn or glorify the IRA, the director focuses solely on the physicality of the prisoners’ grim undertaking. In this approach, “Hunger” bravely reveals the visceral underbelly of a well-known event in English and Irish history. McQueen illustrates with profound artistry the eerie quiet of a hunger strike and the severe calm with which Sands chooses to die. The result is a brutal and emotional film that seeks not to entertain, but instead to let the corporeal imagery speak for itself.—Staff writer Noël D.

In contemporary film making, the short film has come to symbolize a bookending of sorts for the career of a successful director. The short film is the cheapest and most consumable form of creative output that an aspiring director can produce—an opportunity for young filmmakers to play to their strengths and capture the imagination of the gatekeepers between themselves and their first feature-length films. It’s also the medium to which auteurs have the luxury to return after a career of successful feature films—an opportunity, perhaps, to experiment with scripts and styles that wouldn’t necessarily sustain a feature or that better suit a shorter narrative arc. In the auteur’s case, however, the rules of the young entrepreneur still apply; short films, in themselves, are not commercially viable. The chance for exposure, then, comes in much the same form that it does for the short story: a collection. In 2006, a series of 21 short films set in Paris—many of which were directed by high profile industry figures like Wes Craven and the Coen brothers—called “Paris, je t’aime,” was released to much fanfare, and a follow-up project called “New York, I Love You”—featuring a film by Zach Braff among others—is scheduled for limited release in April. Clearly inspired by this anthological approach, directors Michel Gondry (“Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind”), Leos Carax (“Lovers on the Bridge”) and Bong Joon-Ho (“The Host”) have written and directed “Tokyo!”: a collection of three short films all set in the namesake Japanese city, whose common thread is the relentless push of human extremes against the edges of reality.For Gondry, that extreme is melancholy. Hiroko (Ayako Fujitani), the principle character of “Interior Design,” is the beleaguered girlfriend of an aspiring filmmaker, Akira (Ryo Kase), set with the task of finding a place for the couple to live. As Akira’s movie, an absurdly low-budget existential horror called “The Garden of Degradation,” gains attention and Hiroko’s role in the relationship becomes more and more marginalized, she begins to transform into—and finally becomes—a wooden chair. Able to transition between a human body and a chair at will, Hiroko smuggles herself into a young bachelor’s home, where, as she declares to Akira in a letter, she will finally be “useful.” Gondry excels at bringing his signature magic to the story. In particular, the film within the film, and especially Hiroko’s slow transformation into a chair, are rendered with the puppeteer’s elbow-grease so common in Gondry films. And while in the past dialogue has rarely been Gondry’s strong suit, here the chemistry between the young couple—and between the couple and the city itself—combines humor and emotion in charming turns.Monstrosity in its most grotesque is Carax’s fascination in “Merde,” and its form is not quite human. The title character is a sewer-roving satyr-beast who terrorizes the streets of Tokyo in broad daylight—first by simply disturbing the peace, then by killing dozens with a stockpile of antique hand grenades from the Second World War. Arrested, Merde (Denis Lavant) is put on trial, defended by a French lawyer who shares his disfigurements and his inimitable language. Opening with a totally hilarious, totally confounding tracking shot of the creature wordlessly moving along a Tokyo sidewalk, stealing money and flowers to devour, the film only improves. Merde (French for “shit”) is the putrescence of the past that Japan—the creature lives in a den filled with artifacts from the infamous Imperial forces in Nanking—and the world at large wishes to forget. Carax makes another interesting choice in depicting the trial, itself an invocation of post-war war crimes tribunals, in multi-paneled shots that scrutinize every angle of the scene. A mixture of absurdist fairytale and historical criticism, “Merde,” the second film in “Tokyo!” is by far the most visually and substantively rich.This might be what makes Bong’s “Shaking Tokyo” seem like such a disappointment. His extreme—solitude—is the most obvious and the least satisfying. The unnamed hikikomori (Teruyuki Kagawa)—the shut-in—whose phobia of the outside world has kept him in a neatly-arranged, dimly-lit home for 11 years, is forced out into the world when he falls in love with a mysterious pizza-delivery girl whose emotions are controlled by buttons tattooed on her body. Once outside his home (precious little time of the film’s already brief length), Bong manages a few lively shots of the city—emptied of people in the wake of the last earthquake, as the hikikomori runs through the streets—but the majority of the film is devoted to the rather insubstantial relationship between an agoraphobe and an android. Bong’s protagonists fail to draw the viewer into the city the way the wandering characters of Gondry can. They fall short of the enigma or allegory of “Merde,” and his story lacks Carax’s ambition and verve. While not altogether unpleasant, it’s an underwhelming ending to a promising set of films.—Staff writer Ryan J. Meehan can be reached at rmeehan@fas.harvard.edu.

Though it boasts perhaps the most innocuous title in the history of theatre, Harold Pinter’s “The Birthday Party” is certainly not an average five-year-old’s affair. Devoid of any balloons, streamers, or happy children, Pinter’s play is a dark, existentialist work exploring the madness of human nature lurking just below a superficially harmless exterior. “The Birthday Party” will be on show in the Loeb Expository Theatre from April 3-11.“The Birthday Party” premiered in 1958 and is Pinter’s most critically acclaimed play. The story revolves around the terrorization of Stanley Webber, a failed pianist who lives in a rundown boarding house owned by Meg and Petey Boles, to all appearances a bland couple. The trio seem at first to get along splendidly, displaying a mix of familial and flirtatious affection. But these early moments are merely a foil to those that follow the arrival of the rest of the cast. The play shifts tone dramatically with the arrival of Lulu, Stanley’s younger interest, and an ominous duo, Goldberg and McCann, who plan a birthday party for Stanley. As the play progresses, dialogue disintegrates and the plot devolves into disorder.Despite its grave nature, however, the play—which is billed somewhat paradoxically as a “comedy of menace”—also promises moments of hilarity. “In some ways it’s actually hilarious… I’m hoping that everyone else also finds it funny,” says Eve H. Bryggman ’10, who plays Meg.This particular production of “The Birthday Party” seizes upon Pinter’s vision of portraying the fine line between ennui and nightmare. “In conceiving the production, my goal was essentially to make it as Pinteresque as possible,” writes Matthew C. Stone ’11, the play’s director, in an email. As a result, this production foregoes unnecessary embellishment in order to greater emphasize the raw power of the original screenplay’s dialogue.“[‘The Birthday Party’] is not a play with a message, and it’s not about abstract ideas,” Stone writes. “If you stage it right, there’s no need to try to convey something—the ambiguities in the play lead the audience to infer their own meaning, which, to me, is a much more powerful and engaging experience. This is a play that speaks for itself, so I haven’t tried to embellish, impose, or overdo anything. That would just kill it.”Lacking an entirely coherent plotline, “The Birthday Party” relies on evoking emotion, rather than enjoyment, from the audience. Even the set design is minimalist. The stage features only walls on wheels, which move increasingly closer to each other as the play progresses. As with most absurdist dramas, “The Birthday Party” eschews a set in order to maintain focus on the dialogue between actors, thus relying on the cast’s abilities. “We are so lucky to have an incredibly talented cast who is totally capable of handling the challenging material,” writes Morgan L. Mallory ’10, one of the play’s producers, in an email.Around the time Pinter was writing the screenplay for “The Birthday Party,” other playwrights who were proponents of absurdist theatre—such as Eugene Ionesco and Samuel Beckett—were also exploring theater’s possibilities by rejecting conventions such as sequential time patterns and logical dialogue. “The Birthday Party” is part of a movement in the history of theatre which embraces the absurd, and in turn, seeks to unsettle the audience by disorienting them with a menacing and horrifying atmosphere.“We are expecting a sense of confusion from the audience… because even we have a sense of confusion [about the play],” says Bryce J. Gilfillian ’12, the Assistant Stage Manager. “No one can precisely say what Pinter is attempting to achieve with ‘The Birthday Party,’ but in a sense that only adds to the intellectual fun of the experience.”

Yesterday, I overheard a female student telling her friend that coming to Harvard has made her realize that she loves the East Coast. I can’t help but think that, although Harvard may indeed have “the cutest houses ever,” it is impossible for most students to make any judgment on New England at all, let alone the entire East Coast.
Although we will technically live in Massachusetts for four years, the majority of us will never experience the area in its own right. Bracing ourselves against the icy February winds and trudging through the snow to class somehow cajoles us into thinking we know New England life. Sure, we can complain about the weather along with the rest of the locals—but that is where the similarity ends.
When a Harvard student gazes at the quaint red brick buildings in the Yard as sparkling snowflakes land on their roofs, it’s easy to think of all of Massachusetts in the same picturesque way. But while this image certainly can be scenic, what we see on campus everyday represents a very select part of New England. The overused term “Harvard bubble” comes to mind—although we know the quickest way from CVS to Felipe’s, the rarity with which we engage with the rest of the region makes it presumptuous to claim knowledge of anything past Brattle Street.
Fast-forward 20 years. You are now living in California, when a colleague reveals he is from Boston. “Oh, I know Boston!” you reply. “I went to school in the area.” His face lights up as he begins to fire off batting averages for every Red Sox player, praise the outcome of the Big Dig, and lament the loss of Brigham’s best ice-cream flavor. Somehow, replying with “Yup, it sure was cold during Primal Scream” does not seem like the appropriate response, but you realize it is the closest you can come to speaking his language.
Our false sense of familiarity with New England culture is only perpetuated, however, by most of the attempts we make to get closer to the real Massachusetts. PBHA vans shuttle eager students into poor areas of Boston on a daily basis. But the Harvard bubble is not geographical in nature; it is not something you can merely drive past. Such programs are staffed by familiar Harvard students who return thinking they have transcended the borders of the school, when in reality, they have only temporarily stretched them. 
While tutoring children or helping the elderly is certainly admirable, doing it as part of a Harvard group means that there will undoubtedly be a president or coordinator of the group overseeing your actions. Your fellow tutors are in your gov class and you see them out on Saturday nights. The conversations you have to and from your destination are with those same people. Instead of venturing into the outside world, you are merely dragging Harvard with you to Dorchester and back.
Even students from the Boston area are not immune. While most students are very cognizant of the fact that their daily interactions occur with a fixed group of people in self-contained environments, they fail to see that their perception of Massachusetts lies within the bubble as well.
So the next time you find yourself with a little time to spare, trade your Starbucks grande macchiato for a Dunkin Donuts iced coffee, hop on the T and walk the Freedom Trail, or catch a free concert at the Hatch Shell. Go alone or with one friend, not as a part of an organization or program. Although it is not something shiny to put on your resume, leaving Harvard to explore New England is a conscious decision that we should all make at least once during our four years here.
Once you do, you will quickly discover that although America might not run on Dunkin, Boston certainly does. And hopefully, someday you’ll even be able to discuss town politics and the Sox with your future colleagues, just like a Boston local.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’m pleasantly surprised—this is not the column I planned on running today. The days leading up to yesterday’s G-20 London Summit showed all the signs of hubris-hampered, every-economic-bloc-for-itself nasty diplomatic failure. It turned out better than expected: Although many worthwhile bottom-up institutional reforms didn’t squeeze through, the six-pronged plan for global recovery proposed by the leaders of the world’s 19 largest economies, plus the European Union, offers at least a small sign of hope.As the world’s headmen and headwomen arrived in foggy London Town on Wednesday, the horizon appeared gloomy indeed. Merely observing the arrogant behavior of many leaders, one couldn’t help but feel extremely pessimistic. For starters, President Nicolas Sarkozy threatened to walk out if France’s demands for regulation were not met. As President Obama and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown—fresh off his humiliating trip to Latin America—tussled with Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on the priorities of immediate stimulus versus regulation, Paramount Leader Hu Jintao quietly positioned China as the champion of the entire, unrepresented developing world. Meanwhile, President Lula da Silva of Brazil—the planet’s most popular politician, with an 80% approval rating—explicitly blamed the irrationality of white, blue-eyed beasts of prey for the financial crisis.Most importantly, fashionably dressed Italian Prime Mogul Silvio Berlusconi, true to form, arrived at the G-20 completely “G’d up from the feet up.”Smooth teamwork is not the style of diplomacy the world is used to seeing at these meetings. After all, we’ve come to expect deadlock on the most important issues. The last G-20 summit ended with nothing but an agreement to meet again, and the Doha round of international trade talks was a joke.Over the past few years, as the global political landscape has shifted beneath our feet, the emerging economies have found a voice, and American hegemony has receded into a form of influential leadership rather than outright dominance. Decision-making at the global level has been relatively non-existent. Although yesterday’s summit registered no seismic shift toward solidarity and probably nowhere near the number of institutional reforms needed to solve long-term problems, it at least made a strong tremor of cooperation on the geopolitical Richter scale. Cooperation was certainly difficult to establish, mainly due to the growing influence of the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, and China), which are starting to throw a little weight around (though substantially less in Russia’s case). The heydays of the Group of 8 are over, and almost everything proposed at the summit had to get past the emerging economies. Case in point: When Sarkozy proposed a global crackdown on tax-heavens, it was Chinese, not American, opposition that cut down the proposal substantially so it could protect financial centers in Hong Kong and Macao. Globalization, especially in the wake of the financial cataclysm, presents an interesting paradox. As interdependences and exchanges around the world expand, multiply, and intensify, more and more problems require multilateral solutions. However, as more and more states have a crucial and invested say in these problems, multilateral consensus becomes more difficult to reach. The fact that 20 of the world’s richest economies were able to come to some kind of consensus when there appeared to be giant rifts speaks volumes and provides hope for the future.There is certainly still much work to be done to change the economic order that brought about the catastrophe in the first place. The upgrade of the Financial Stability Forum to a Financial Stability Board is a huge step. Investment bankers and derivative traders are getting what’s coming in the form of regulated pay and bonuses. Hedge funds will have to disclose their leverage levels to regulators. But deep structural changes in other international financial institutions must occur soon. It’s great that the IMF received funds to aid struggling developing countries, but part of the reason those countries are in the position they’re in is because of IMF advice: The IMF must become more cautious, contextualist, and concerned with sustainability. The same goes for the World Bank.Still, the commitment to tackle a global problem is an impressive, mammoth feat. This never happened during the Great Depression. I have no doubt that Paul Krugman or Joseph Stiglitz will sober up my analysis of the summit in the next few days. But, for now, I’m chalking up this one as a small win and my “animal spirits,” to quote John Maynard Keynes, are high. A little more confidence in collaboration is a nice thing to have, and confidence, after all, is what recovery is made of.Raúl A.

While Harvard’s Class of 2009 issued a collective “Huh?” on Tuesday when it was announced that television personality Matt Lauer would be this year’s Class Day speaker, other colleges have seen far more spirited reactions to their graduation orators. Barack Obama will deliver the commencement address at the University of Notre Dame this May. Far from being overjoyed at the news, many Catholics are fuming at the choice. Since the decision was announced, groups and individuals inside and outside of the Notre Dame community have made their opposition clear: Because of Obama’s status as a pro-choice politician, these “defenders of the unborn” oppose the invitation extended to (and accepted by) the president to be Notre Dame’s principal commencement speaker and the recipient of an honorary degree.It is no surprise that staunch religious conservatives are less than keen on the idea of having a Democrat as the speaker and honorary degree recipient at one of the best-known and highly regarded Catholic universities in the United States. That news became old news faster than the average Boston College freshman gets drunk on his first St. Patrick’s Day sans parents. The defenses given for the choice were equally predictable: It was not intended to reflect the majority opinion held by members of the Notre Dame community on the issue of abortion, but rather to honor a president committed to principles of social justice that Catholics also espouse. The media flurry that chased the protests illuminated the arguments of supporters and opponents of Obama but has missed the larger question here: Why are people so surprised (and indignant) that Catholics are pissed off about this?It is intriguing to me that so many find the opposition to Obama incomprehensible. My gut reaction to this dissent was disbelief: Notre Dame affiliates had a lot of nerve to protest the president’s appearance as I searched Matt Lauer on Wikipedia and prayed that I might still catch a glimpse of Michelle Obama (and her phenomenal biceps) at commencement. I can only hope that Steven Chu is equally toned.Yet this knee-jerk response ignores the role that faith plays in the lives of many Americans—including intellectuals at institutions such as Notre Dame. While many agnostics might be loath to admit it, intense religiosity is not entirely antithetical to intellectualism. It might be hard for the card-carrying pro-choice Democrat at Harvard to comprehend that a young, bright college student or university scholar would object to Obama as Notre Dame’s commencement speaker. It is nearly impossible for many Ivy League  intellects to associate him with anything but progressivism, hope, change, and various other inspiring motifs that the vast majority of young coastal dwellers and I happen to buy into wholeheartedly. For many of us, Obama is the first Democrat we could vote for and feel proud to call our president. That he is pro-choice does not conflict with our partisanship and political leanings the way it might for Catholic liberals who feel torn between the party’s commitment to social justice and its support of a woman’s right to choose.A coalition of university-sponsored student groups (including the Notre Dame Right to Life, the Notre Dame College Republicans, and the University of Notre Dame Anscombe Society) has made it clear on its website that opposition to Obama’s presence and degree is not a matter of political partisanship. Rather, “Obama’s hostility to the Catholic Church’s teachings on the sanctity of human life at its earliest stages” spurs the coalition’s ire. The university’s decision, it argues, violates the policy of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, which prohibits the honoring of pro-choice politicians.That the “University of Our Lady” should be a site of contention over a woman’s right to legislate control over her own body seems almost too perfect a coincidence. For many of us, the words that the protesters use to describe the university’s decision in their online petition—“outrage,” “scandal,” and “travesty”—would better connote the curtailing of federal funding for safe abortion procedures, the outlawing of taxpayer-funded stem-cell research, or the barring of marriage equality than the sins they attribute to Obama. Moreover, not every commencement speaker or honorary degree recipient at Notre Dame needs to espouse political beliefs that conform to Catholic doctrine. Presumably, the university awards degrees to students who are pro-choice.Notre Dame’s invitation to Obama does not imply that the university condones his positions on abortion, stem-cell research, and gay marriage, but rather that Notre Dame recognizes and appreciates its status as a premier institution that should facilitate intellectual exchange—including debate on this issue itself. Critics of Notre Dame’s choice have chosen to engage the issue intelligently: One image designed to protest the speech depicts a Shepard Fairey-style fetus underlined with the word “HUMAN,” invoking the popular representation of Obama during the election. This deployment of popular liberal imagery against a Democrat suggests that opponents to Obama’s speech are cognizant of the iconographic profile of their political adversaries.Although the critics who oppose the university’s choice to honor Barack Obama might be misguided in their complaints, they warrant our reasoned skepticism, not our total disbelief. How soon have we forgotten how it feels to be expected to honor a president whose personal convictions and political maneuvers run so contrary to our morals? Emma M.

Not too long ago, one of the safest icebreakers used to be a complaint about the apathy of the American voter. “More votes were cast for the American Idol winner than for the presidential candidate,” one would say after 2004, to instinctive nods of shared outrage.Fast-forward to 2008, and Barack Obama has transformed the political landscape. His call to unite the nation not only attracted the young, but it also hooked some members of the most improbable constituency—the Republican Party. But, while Obama brought fewer prejudices to the presidency than his predecessor, did he also succeed in breaking down our biases and clinging to comfort? No, he did not.It is hard to avoid the impression that we simply cherry-picked Obama’s (admittedly phenomenal) 2004 speech. While it was remarkably effective at bringing fame to the Illinois senator, it failed to change us in any meaningful way. Our notions about those who are ideologically distant remain inert, in spite of Obama’s early pleas. At our school and elsewhere, for instance, many still speak of the “red states” as if they were inhabited by spiders or other equally unpleasant creatures. Or, to take an example from the other side of the political spectrum, consider the strange mutation of the campaign in September 2008, when it suddenly started to matter where one came from. It’s still easy to recall how a candidate repeatedly insisted that the size of one’s birthplace is (somehow) a reliable predictor of character.Of course, uniting a diverse nation is probably an infeasible task. No president, at least in a democracy, has the ability to tell citizens what to believe. What is in the president’s power, however, is to challenge those who listen to him—but Obama is still too hesitant to do so. During a recent press conference, for example, he essentially dismissed a question from NBC correspondent Chuck Todd. Todd asked why, if past presidents had had the power to call for some form of sacrifice, Obama did not ask for something specific now, especially since he purports to seek a “new era of responsibility.”The president’s politically safe response was that “folks are sacrificing left and right.” This expression of sympathy may be commendable, but it is not enough. The crisis does not justify not confronting our life styles. Due to subsidies to agribusinesses, we don’t bear the true costs of food; due to an irrational fear of nuclear power, we are dependent on foreign sources of energy. Ideally, these and other indefensible policies and approaches should be relegated to the trash piles we are so good at generating. If changing these policies is too difficult—a testimony to our elected representatives’ true motives—we could at least be asked to pay for the damage we cause.The most obvious example is driving. Americans drive too much, and they have good reason to do so. In the United States, gas tends to be two to three times cheaper than in Western Europe, since federal and state gas taxes in the U.S. are inefficiently low. Now that oil prices around the world have fallen, it would be the best time to gradually start raising gasoline taxes, which would limit gas consumption, pollution, and congestion as well as motivate people to move closer to work or to demand more public transportation. Unlike regulations or rations, higher taxes would not take away personal freedoms, but they would bring in revenues that could be used to pay down debt and alleviate far-reaching concerns over the U.S. economy.But we are not asked to pay more when we pollute, as if the crisis has made us incapable of hearing or accepting that some of our habits need an immediate change. Instances like this open a space for those in positions of authority to make reasonable requests of the American people. Perhaps the president knows that he cannot ask us for this much. I would still welcome it if he boldly tried.Jan Zilinsky ’09, a Crimson editorial writer, is an economics concentrator in Mather House.

On Tuesday, seniors dutifully checked the website set up to reveal this year’s Class Day speaker selection, but, of course, they were foolish to believe that a single website could long survive bearing the weight of the name of this then-unknown titan of entertainment. And, in fact, it came crashing down. When word finally spread from the Senior Class Committee that the elected speaker would be Matt Lauer, some laughed and some cried. His name sounded vaguely familiar to us, so we keyed up Wikipedia and YouTube to recall the accomplishments of this luminary, whoever he was. This was a mere halt though; after a thorough review of his credentials—and glowing testaments of his charm from local Cambridge housewives—the current anchor of the Today Show appears to be the perfect pick.
Matt Lauer is a man who has done it all. He has interviewed everyone from Bill Clinton to Sacha Baron Cohen to Miss Piggy. He has traveled to Wall Street, Main Street, and, yes, even Sesame Street—whatever it takes to get the story. 
Lauer has had a remarkable breadth of experiences during his career. Harvard seniors must be prepared for the harsh realities they will face after graduation. They will need to gather and prepare food without the aid of HUDS. Lucky Matt Lauer can recount the authentic Shanghai pork dumpling recipe he once learned from Chef Leung! Meanwhile, seniors will encounter a rapidly shifting culture beyond Harvard’s walls. Who knows more about culture than Matt Lauer—the man who has hosted not one, not two, but 11 Macy’s Thanksgiving Day parades! And, of course, seniors will all need to try extreme kiteboarding. Surprise—Matt Lauer tried extreme kiteboarding once.
More so than anything after graduation, this class needs to understand and handle adversity. Matt Lauer faces adversity every day. He has verbally grappled with the eloquent Ann Coulter, debated the high intellect of Tom Cruise, and, somehow, Matt Lauer goes to work with Al Roker EVERY DAY of the year. These battle scars may seem trite, but, in the annals of daytime television, they are nothing short of legendary. Just last week, the man survived a wild deer attack. No word on whether the deer was so fortunate.
The selection of Matt Lauer is extremely timely. The fast world of news and journalism is evolving before us every day. Leaders of the industry have been swallowed up by novel technologies, going by the name “new media.” Sadly, print journalism faces an uncertain future (you’re probably reading this on a screen, aren’t you!). With Lauer on his way ,we must tip our caps to new media—you win this one “TV.” We are not losing hope for more traditional news personalities to make a resurgence, though. Don’t be surprised to see someone from radio or telegraph rolling through the Yard in 2010.

For the second consecutive year—and the ninth time in the past 15 years—a team of three Harvard undergraduates won the William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition. The winning team members were Arnav Tripathy ’11, Iurie Boreico ’11, and Zachary R. Abel ’10, each of whom received a $1,000 award for their victory in the team competition. The six-hour, 12-question exam was administered by the Mathematical Association of America in the first week of December. A total of 3,627 students from 545 colleges in the United States and Canada participated. The premier undergraduate mathematics competition covers fields such as group theory, set theory, graph theory, and number theory.  Results were released by the Harvard mathematics department on Monday, and one Harvard participant attributed his victory partly to serendipity. “I’m very happy to help the team,” Boreico said. “I almost forgot to register for the Putnam. Luckily I got an email reminder right before the deadline.” For the second year in a row, Tripathy was named a Putnam fellow—an honor given to the five highest scorers on the exam. He received a prize of $2,500. Tripathy could not be reached for comment. “I didn’t prepare for it at all,” Boreico said. “I did a lot of math competitions in high school and stopped preparing for them in college.”The exam is not representative of pure mathematics, according to Boreico. “It’s different because of the limited amount of time,” he said. “The questions are much easier than math research questions but you have to be very quick and careful.” Teams of three students are chosen to represent their schools each year, but students can also participate individually.  Boreico and Alex Zhai ’12 were among the top 16 ranking individuals, each winning a prize of $1,000. “My laptop’s broken,” said Boreico. “I’ll spend the money on a new one.”Abel placed among the next nine highest ranking individuals in the competition. Kevin Carde ’09, Zhou Fan ’09, Rosen D. Kralev ’09, Yi Sun ’09, Dmitry Vaintrob ’11, Ameya A. Velingker ’09 and Neal Wadhwa ’09 all received honorable mentions. Behind Harvard, teams from Princeton, MIT, Stanford, and Caltech rounded out the top five teams this year. —Staff writer Michael J.

Babson College students returned to class yesterday after the institution was forced to close for four days due to an outbreak of Norovirus.The gastrointestinal virus, which can induce diarrhea, nausea, and stomach pains, had infected more than 80 students by last Saturday and still had a handful of patients trickling into Babson’s campus infirmary as of Tuesday. Although 15 infected students had to be transported to local hospitals, the worst appears to be over.“[The Wellesley Board of Health and the Wellesley Health Department have]  both expressed full support for our decision to reopen at this time and for our planned actions going forward,” Babson College President Leonard A. Schlesinger said in a statement released on Tuesday. The College has responded to the outbreak by putting a strong emphasis on the necessity of practicing good hygiene. The substitution of condiments packets for salt and pepper shakers and chef-prepared salads instead of an open salad bar are a few small changes Babson officials hope will make a big difference. An extensive educational campaign centered around washing hands is also in the works.“We’re taking really tough precautions of wiping everything down. It’s all about hygiene,” said Dennis Hanno, dean of the Undergraduate School at Babson College. “We’ve also been very proactive in encouraging students to stay on campus. We’ve  cancelled all athletic events up until Thursday to minimize our formal interactions between other campuses.”And with the virus’ diminishing presence at Babson, the attention now shifts to other Boston area colleges and what needs to be done to prevent a similar campus outbreak. In Harvard’s case, administrative officials echoed Hanno’s call for a health-conscious and hygienic campus. “The only thing that we can do is practice good hygiene. Good hygiene is essential in preventing these types of infections,” said David S. Rosenthal ’59, the director of Harvard University Health Services. Harvard already requires hand sanitizer in every dining hall and gloves on every dining hall worker to curb the potential spread of disease. Although many schools have now taken the necessary precautions to stop future epidemics, the Norovirus is no stranger to college campuses across the country. Within the past year, it has already infected Georgetown, USC, and Hope College in Michigan.

When asked how online dating giant eHarmony.com went from one just user to millions of singles seeking love, CEO Gregory L. Waldorf said, “Just sheer hustle.”About 15 people gathered on the fourth floor of Harvard Student Agencies yesterday in an event sponsored by the Harvard College Entrepreneurship Forum to listen to Waldorf talk about his experience with the match-making start-up. Waldorf joined the company in August 2000 as a founding investor.The main question Waldorf addressed was a central problem facing Internet entrepreneurs. How can online businesses devise a model that could turn a profit when people are accustomed to free services and online advertising has failed generate substantial revenue? Currently, eHarmony charges $59.95 for a one-month subscription.“It’s not that young people don’t want to pay for services on the Internet. Nobody wants to pay for services on the Internet,” Waldorf said, adding, “I think the Internet is at little bit of a crossroads right now.”His words of wisdom to the assembled budding entrepreneurs were simple. “My number one piece of advice: don’t go into consulting or banking.” Waldorf emphasized the importance of “facing the customer,” saying that resumes with experience in sales went to the top of his hire list. eHarmony, founded by psychologist and marriage counselor Neil Clark Warren, distinguishes itself from other dating websites by its research-based 250-word questionnaire that matches people on 29 dimensions of personality. The service has proven immensely popular, and is responsible for two percent of all new marriages in the United States, according to the website.“Though the economy is so tough right now, it’s such an exciting time to be coming out of school,” he said.He added that the company, which currently operates in four English-speaking markets, is looking to expand into other global markets. Recently, eHarmony has conducted research on married couples in China. Their matching algorithm, Waldorf said, “varies from country to country and culture to culture.”The company has been beset by lawsuits in recent years for not offering gay dating services. eHarmony rolled out a separate gay dating website called Compatible Partners earlier this week as part of a settlement of a 2008 New Jersey case. -Staff writer Lingbo Li can be reached at lingboli@fas.harvard.edu

Local smokers expressed mixed opinions about the federal tobacco tax increase that took effect yesterday.The tax, which increased the levy from $.39 per pack to $1.01 per pack, was approved earlier this year. For Massachusetts residents, this hike comes on top of the hefty $2.51 per pack state tax on cigarettes.Paul J. MacDonald, owner of Harvard Square tobacco shop Leavitt & Peirce, said that he was unhappy with the substantial tax increase.“We treat everybody like rockstars here [at Leavitt & Peirce.] And obviously the government feels the same way--they think that they have money like rockstars,” said MacDonald. “And they don’t.” He added that his biggest qualm with the change was its sheer magnitude.“[The government is] trying to discourage tobacco use,” he said. “That’s fair. In fact, I agree with that. We’re just here if you do choose to smoke. I just find the rate unfair.”Leavitt & Peirce customer Joseph D. Reaves, said that he felt that the recent rise in tobacco taxes was ludicrous.“I think it’s just another vice tax. [The government is] trying to balance the budget on the backs of smokers,” he said. Some local smokers said they agreed with MacDonald and mentioned that the tax hike would affect the smokers more than the tobacco corporations. “It’s ridiculous. It doesn’t hurt the tobacco companies at all, just the smokers. A lot of them are on a tight budget as it is,” said Michael L. Nachbar, a student at Tufts University.Nachbar added that he sympathized with serious smokers. “I’m never  going to bum a cigarette again,” he said.But other residents said they approved of the newly implemented tax.“I’m a big fan of taxing commodities like cigarettes instead of taxing necessary goods,” said Zachariah P. Hughes ‘12.Local resident Lacey J. Lemander added that she thought the tax was justified. “If you’re going to smoke cigarettes, you’re affecting the health of others as well as your own, so I think its fair.”She said that tax will not affect her smoking habits.MacDonald later offered a piece of advice to the government regarding its tax plans.“Legalize pot. Tax the hell out of it. Do you know how much money they’d make?” he said.

Representatives from the Advocate, the Dudley Co-op, the Crimson, and two final clubs, the Fox and the Spee, defended their student groups as “safe spaces” at a sex and student group real estate panel yesterday evening.The Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response specialist Gordon W. Braxton and Associate Dean of the College Judith H. Kidd were also present and spoke at the beginning of the panel, which was co-sponsored by Harvard’s student-run sex magazine H Bomb and OSAPR. Moderator Colette S. Perold ’11 posed questions to the panelists, inquiries that focused on diversity, social spaces, and sexual assault. She began the panel by insisting that no specific organizations were being targeted or blamed in any way.“This is about open conversation about some of the spaces on this campus,” Perold said. Fox member Daniel E. Herz-Roiphe ’10, who is also the co-chair of the Crimson Editorial Board, and Spee member John F. Bowman ’11 defended the final clubs by trying to debunk common stereotypes. Both argued that final clubs are more heterogeneous than they are perceived to be, although the two acknowledged that the final club membership is wealthier than the student body at large.“It’s one of the most racially diverse organizations that I know of,” Bowman said of the Spee.At the same time, Advocate member Millicent M. Younger ’10 and Dudley Co-op president Paul Nauert ’09 regretted the relative lack of ethnic diversity in their organizations, but pointed out that their groups are much closer to gender equity compared to the all-male final clubs.“They perpetuate an unequal gender-power dynamic at this school,” Herz-Roiphe said of final clubs. He suggested that either final clubs could become co-ed or that female final clubs could become more popular.“Final clubs in general are heteronormative and it’s a shame,” Bowman said.In discussing sexual assault, both final club representatives said clubs do their best to prevent sexual assault and have rejected potential members during the punch process due to anxieties about sexual assault. Perold’s question about the mystique of social organizations was also most directly applicable to final clubs. However, both Bowman and Herz-Roiphe said they did not consider secrecy an important aspect of their final club experience.“Like most other secrets, when you expose them to the light of day, they’re not that cool,” Herz-Roiphe said. “Mystique is power.”—Staff writer Danielle J.

Two Harvard students were among only ten budding scientists nationwide this year to earn a much-coveted graduate fellowship granted by the Hertz Foundation. Each of the ten students was awarded $250,000, “no strings attached,” to pursue graduate studies in engineering and the applied sciences. Timothy L. Kovachy ’09, and Jeff Thompson, a Harvard graduate student in physics, faced even higher odds than applicants in previous year—the number of fellowships granted this year by the Hertz Foundation was reduced by 50 percent. The winners were selected from 543 other scientists, a pool comparable in size to those of previous years. “The process for earning the fellowship is quite rigorous,” Kovachy said. “You are expected to not only have done significant research in the sciences, but to have a general knowledge of virtually all scientific subjects.” To win a Hertz fellowship, candidates are required to submit a detailed application and participate in two rounds of interviews. During the first interview, applicants were asked questions from all areas of physics, chemistry, biology, and statistics. The second round was geared more towards a discussion of what the applicant intended to do with his fellowship. Kovachy said that he was up to the challenge, having spent his last three summers doing research in physics at Stanford, and experimenting with physical principles on his own. The Winthrop house resident is especially interested in utilizing “atomic interferometers” to measure gravitational forces at the quantum level. “Essentially, I measure how two atoms fall simultaneously, much like Galileo measured how two balls fell in synchronization from atop the Tower of Pisa,” Kovachy said. If there is some atomic interference—that is, if two atoms of rubidium do not fall simultaneously—then scientists will have to rethink how gravitational forces act on particles generally. Thompson will also be pursuing research in physics.                              —PAUL C.

In accordance with an accreditation process that occurs every ten years, the University has crafted its most refined draft of a self-study report required for the institution’s review for reaccreditation in October.The committee involved in the revising process currently has a “reasonably-completed draft report,” said Computer Science Professor Margo I. Seltzer, who presented the most recent version yesterday to the Faculty Council—the 18-member governing body of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences—in order to incorporate the professors’ feedback.Seltzer said the committee will present a refined draft to the Harvard community in about a month to draw further commentary. The University, which began initial drafting of the approximately 100-page report last summer, has spent the past few months further editing the report, which addresses how the institution is working to meet the eleven standards of accreditation, ranging from academics to university finances.After the University finishes this process, a committee of faculty and administrators from similar institutions will visit the campus in the fall to draw up recommendations for submission to the New England Association of Schools and Colleges’ (NEASC) Commission on Institutions of Higher Education, which will make its final decision on Harvard’s accreditation next spring.“The structure of the reaccreditation is such that it provides the University with an opportunity and a framework in which to step back and examine what we do,” Seltzer said. “It’s a useful exercise.”The University—which had its last comprehensive review in the fall of 1997, then submitted an interim report in 2003—undergoes the voluntary, peer-review process of accreditation every decade by NEASC, one of six regional accrediting organizations in the U.S.In addition to the University’s overall accreditation, most of the professional and graduate schools undergo individual accreditation procedures by their respective review bodies.—Staff writer Esther I.

A mostly-female group of 20 gathered in the Lowell House Junior Common Room last night to view popular television shows and to discuss portrayals of women in modern television. The informal event, sponsored by the Harvard College Women’s Center, the Seneca Inc., and the Organization of Asian American Sisters in Service, sparked conversation on female sexuality, competition, and relationships as seen in Grey’s Anatomy, Nip/Tuck, and Gossip Girl. Yi-Hui “Ivy” Wu ’09 decided to organize this event for her senior project as an intern at the Women’s Center. “I’m focusing on the role of pop culture and popular TV on how we view women, because I think that people don’t always realize how much of an impact pop culture has on how we see things,” Wu said.Although shows like Gossip Girl, Nip/Tuck, and Grey’s Anatomy are, first and foremost, forms of entertainment, said OAASIS Director of Communications Jessica J. Wen ’10, they can also have detrimental effects on the way people view women. “Especially with ‘Gossip Girl,’ there’s a lot of petty fighting, and general cattiness,” said Wen in an interview before the event. “It tends to portray girls negatively through situations like fighting over boys, getting back at each other...stupid stuff like that.” Others disagreed: “especially in the last 10 years, women have increasingly been portrayed in a positive way,” said Ann Marie Brouillette ’09, membership chair for the Seneca and one of the discussion moderators.“There have been a lot more strong female characters in shows,” said Brouillette, who is also an inactive Crimson business editor. “There are still issues related to body image, female sexuality and female competition, but I would say that it’s a display of certain stereotypes of women that people currently have.” Exploring topics from catfights to using sex as manipulation, attendees viewed five to 10-minute clips and delved into deeper discussions on self-image and mental health. The group spoke on the danger of watching these shows that portray a focus on the superficial and exaggerated social expectations.  “The way it affects us is subconscious,” Wu said. “Whatever is familiar to you becomes the norm, and our ideas of relationships and sexuality are shaped by what we expose ourselves to.”  Characters become role models to those who base their metrics of social interaction on television shows, said Michelle M. Parilo ’10, president of the Seneca, in a phone interview. “It’s not an extreme problem, but it does impact how women think,” Parilo said.

Pistachios are the latest nut to disappear from Harvard dining hall menus. The move comes in response to a warning issued earlier this week by the Food and Drug Administration about salmonella contamination of products from Setton Pistachios of Terra Bella, Inc. Just two months ago, Harvard University Dining Services eliminated all peanuts from their dishes in the wake of a salmonella outbreak attributed to several peanut products. The FDA and the California Department of Public Health is still investigating the incident, and Setton has voluntarily recalled around one million pounds of pistachios—both shelled and unshelled—while completely stopping distribution. Setton has also contacted all its wholesalers and asked them to recall their products.HUDS, in consultation with the University’s Environmental Health and Safety Department, is revising its menu. “We are reviewing every single product we offer for possible pistachio use and are working to remove them from service,” said Crista Martin, the HUDS spokesperson.Popular Harvard Square ice cream shop J.P. Licks has also changed its menu to guard against contaminated nuts. “We’ve taken the pistachio ice-cream off the board and are waiting for more information before bringing it back,” said Kathryn Lapolla, a J.P. Licks supervisor.Herrell’s Ice Cream and Espresso Bar has remained largely unaffected by the entire salmonella outbreak. “We haven’t served pistachio ice cream in a while, and it isn’t a popular topping,” said Jared Sheeham, the manager on shift yesterday afternoon. “We also managed to avoid the peanut recall.” The Market in the Square is one of the few places still serving pistachios—in its gelato—in the absence of any notices from the Massachusetts Health and Homelands Alert Network. Employees at C’est Bon Convenience were unaware of the Setton recall.Students agreed with the safety consideration taken but wondered if it was necessary. “I haven’t seen pistachios on the menu, but there’s no reason to completely remove them because of one manufacturer,” said Casey L. Cazer ’12.Another student, Aleksandra L. Syrkina ’12, agreed with HUDS’ action but said she “wouldn’t really notice if they took [pistachios] off.”

Venkatesh “Venky” Narayanamurti has been appointed the new director of the Science, Technology, and Public Policy Program of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at the Kennedy School of Government.
“We were extraordinarily pleased to have a person who has one leg firmly rooted in the sciences and another leg that’s interested in and has experience in policy,” said Graham T. Allison, the director of the Belfer Center.
Allison said that the timing worked out particularly well, since Venky—who is currently the John A. and Elizabeth S. Armstrong Professor of engineering and applied sciences and a professor of physics—stepped down last year as Dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. There, he spearheaded the effort to transform the institution from a division into a school, and he was interested in the Belfer Center position.
Venky will be succeeding John P. Holdren, who is currently on leave to serve in the Obama Administration as the director of the White House Office on Science and Technology and as the assistant to the president for science and technology.
In a repetition of history, the founding director of the Science, Technology, and Public Policy Program, Harvey Brooks, had also previously served as Dean of the then Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
“The whole thing has a lot of echoes,” said Allison, who is also a Kennedy School professor. “Harvey is universally regarded as a giant in this domain, so each of Harvey’s successors stand on his shoulders.”Venky is currently on sabbatical at Harvard Business School and the Kennedy School, where he is working to develop efficient management techniques for engineering and research institutions.
He is also helping to create the new undergraduate concentration “Technology, Self, and Society,” which will focus on the interplay between technology and society.
In an interview last year, Venky said that his work at the Business and Kennedy schools would “require a different kind of culture and mindset—I want to use my experience to aid undergraduates and the University.”
His interdisciplinary outlook will be an asset at the Belfer Center, Allison said, which seeks to train future leaders on policy issues related to the intersection of science, technology, the environment, and international affairs and security, according to the Center’s Web site.
“I think he is an excellent choice,” said Lewis M. Branscomb, who is another director emeritus of the Science, Technology, and Public Program. “I believe he understands the relationship between scientific development and economic growth and right at the moment, that is the issue.”
Venky received his doctoral degree in physics from Cornell University and worked at both Sandia National Laboratories and Bell Labs, where he managed groups that explored the interface of business and engineering. He then served as Dean of the School of Engineering at the University of California Santa Barbara before coming to Harvard in 1998.

Student and worker protests erupted at Harvard Medical School yesterday after budgetary cutbacks made this week the last week of employment for nine janitorial workers hired from a subcontracted company.
Medical School students and union officials said that the layoffs are very likely to continue, with more cuts scheduled for July 1. Over the course of the day, three protests took place, the last being a candlelight vigil that drew over 40 people to the Medical School Quadrangle in the midst of a light rain. 
At the vigil, students and union members read the testimonies of four workers who will be laid off, effective Friday—one who had worked at HMS for three years, another for two.
The Medical School employs 110 custodial workers, according to Richard M. Shea, an associate dean of planning and facilities. 77 of those workers are on the direct payroll and 33 are subcontracted through the American Cleaning Company. 
“All signs point to more layoffs in the future,” said Courtney Snegroff, of Service Employees International Union Local 615, which organized the three protests. “The ultimate employer is Harvard. It is up to them to make these cuts.”
Benjamin J. Oldfield, a medical student, said that layoffs should be a last resort, and that he has seen no drastic efforts to reduce other costs. 
“The building is still warm, there are still events with beer and wine,” he said. “We are willing to make those sacrifices.”
Oldfield said that students need to be more “in the know” about University finances. He stressed that Harvard’s non-profit status—and tax breaks—result from the large number of jobs the University provides for the community.
“If it’s a question of preserving the endowment or preserving the workers and their livelihoods, we think the choice is very clear,” Oldfield said.
Executive Dean for Administration Daniel G. Ennis will lead a town hall meeting Friday with students to discuss the Medical School’s current financial status.
Shea said that because of economic pressures hitting the Medical School, his department determined that it could reduce costs by deferring maintenance and cutting cleaning services in areas that are not heavily used.
He said that Harvard officials met with representatives from SEIU and American Cleaning, and asked that the laid-off employees be placed elsewhere.
Shea said that if there are any future vacancies, Harvard would like to hire the laid-off employees on its own staff. He said that other cutbacks have included efforts to increase energy efficiency on campus and centralizing equipment purchases through service contracts. 
Lee Santos, a district manager at the ACC, said that his company was not involved in the protests, which he said were organized by the union members only. He said the nine people laid off averaged 20 hours of work per week for Harvard. 
“I don’t think anybody enjoys applying job cuts to any company but in some cases it is necessary,” he said.
Santos said that the company met with the laid-off employees and told them they had the right to collect unemployment benefits until placements open up elsewhere.“Can I guarantee them a job at this point?” Santos asked.  “At this point, I cannot.”

Nearly four months after the anticipated debut of a comprehensive plan for House renovations, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds released the final Report on Harvard House Renewal yesterday afternoon in an e-mail to the College community. The report—a compilation of feedback from focus groups, five House Program Planning Subcommittees, and a college-wide survey that was initially scheduled to come out in December—provides an action plan for the next generation of House life and focuses specifically on the areas of academic, social, and residential space.“Our overarching goal has been to explore the unique role and purpose of House life in the educational experience of Harvard students,” Hammonds wrote in a preface to the report.  She stressed that this goal would be realized in spite of “challenging economic times.”The administration’s commitment to the renovation project—slated to break ground in 2012­—is significant in light of the cost of House renewal, which is projected to consume nearly four percent of the University’s shrunken endowment, or $1 billion.   At the top of the list for proposed improvements to House life is improving the quality of faculty-student interactions within the House system. In particular, the “outdated” Senior Common Rooms will be revitalized through a pilot House Fellows Program in some Houses, according to the report. The initiative will establish clear expectations for Fellows, who will have short tenures, in order to facilitate “casual yet meaningful” exchanges between undergraduates and faculty members.  Also set to receive a facelift is the role of resident tutors in academic and social life. The report notes that tutors are often responsible for heavy workloads and recommends that tutors recruit upperclassmen to “augment the programmatic roles of Specialty Tutors,” such as those of the sexuality and race relations liaisons.  Still on the menu for house renewal is the exploration of late-night dining options, including the possibility of remodeled student grilles and an unspecified “new proposal” for late-night eating spaces.  Finally, the report addresses some of the concrete architectural plans that are in the works, including the elimination of walk-through rooms. Collectively, these blueprints are intended to foster greater contact among students of various class years. “Houses are an integral part of our students’ academic experience,” Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith wrote in an e-mail. —Staff writer Bita M. Assad can be reached at bassad@fas.harvard.edu. —Staff writer Ahmed N. Mabruk can be reached at amabruk@fas.harvard.edu.

In a move that will save tens of thousands of dollars, the course catalog, student and faculty handbooks, and Q guide will no longer be published in print. Beginning this fall, they will only be available online, the University announced in a statement yesterday.The initiative will not only shave costs and eliminate waste in a time of financial duress but will offer a flexibility unseen in printed materials like the course catalog, which “is significantly out-of-date before the first copy rolls off the press,” Barry Kane, registrar of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, said in the statement.Faculty must finalize course data in time for the May print deadline, but information can easily change in the interim before the start of the next academic year, according to Kane. By the time students are filling out their spring study cards, the printed catalog is nine months old.Eliminating printed versions of the materials will also answer University President Drew G. Faust’s call for re-evaluating activities that may increase green house gas levels, Kane said.“It’s too bad, but given the sacrifices and contractions that are going on, I think it’s the right thing to do,” said computer science professor Harry R. Lewis ’68, who believes that a certain sentimentality is attached to the ubiquitous books. “It’s just inevitable.”The University had been contemplating whether to eliminate its printed handbooks—over the years, other schools have done so—but the initiative “gained steam as something real” because of the financial crisis, according to FAS dean Michael D. Smith.The initiative will eliminate printed copies of the “Courses of Instruction,” “Harvard College Handbook for Students,” “The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Handbook for Students,” “Q Guide,” and “Information for Faculty Offering Instruction in Arts and Sciences.”The University plans to integrate on-line course evaluation information with the shopping tool so that students can view a course’s Q scores and compare classes on the basis of various parameters. A new tool will allow students to view analyses of evaluation data that are not available in the printed guide.“[T]he on-line versions of these documents give the user a greater ability to access information, and much more flexibility in viewing multiple sources of information synoptically,” said Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris in the statement.—Staff writer Esther I. Yi can be reached at estheryi@fas.harvard.edu.

Yesterday’s game against non-conference foe Holy Cross gave Harvard baseball a chance to hone its game before a critical weekend slate of Ivy contests. 
Unfortunately for the Crimson, the 12-11 loss exposed sloppy play that concerned Harvard coach Joe Walsh.
“We’re not a sound fundamental ball club...We’re not doing the little things that win ballgames,” Walsh said. “We giftwrapped that ballgame and said ‘here you go.’”
Walsh lamented missed opportunties both at the plate and on the basepaths, as well as costly defensive blunders. 
The Crimson committed three errors in the field—including a costly overthrow of first base by freshman Jeff Reynolds to yield an extra run in the fourth—but the game’s most painful moments shone on offense. 
In both the fifth and ninth innings, Harvard wasted two outs attempting to advance leadoff runners from second base to third, nullifying potential big rallies and eliminating sacrifice fly opportunities. 
To add to the squad’s frustration, even with a runner on third and first with no outs, the Crimson ran itself into the ground. 
Senior Tom Stack-Babich and sophomore Sean O’Hara occupied the corners in the second before Crusaders starter Matt Croglio caught O’Hara leaning. 
A quick throw to first left O’Hara in a pickle, prompting Stack-Babich to edge off of third in an attempt to help his cornered teammate. 
First baseman Eric Oxford alertly fired the ball to third—nailing Stack-Babich—before third baseman Matt Perry relayed the ball to second to complete a double play. 
With O’Hara tagged out, a disappointed and self-critical Walsh watched a promising situation yield two outs and empty sacks.
“The fact that we can’t do things—moving runners, throwing strikes, challenging hitters at the right time—that’s a mindset that needs to be changed,” Walsh said.
PITCHING CAROUSELWith four-game weekends looming during the regular season, Walsh has been forced to get creative with Wednesday pitching. 
Against Holy Cross, Harvard trotted out five relievers to the mound after sophomore starter Daniel Berardo logged only two innings. 
Although Berardo delivered effectively in his short outing, captain Harry Douglas pointed to the need to keep the Crimson’s injury-riddled pitching staff well-rested.
“[In] these types of games we just try to give the guys a couple innings,” he said. “They can handle that on their arms and bounce back for the w eekend.”
Freshman Connor Hulse, senior Adam Cole, sophomore Anthony Nutter, Stack-Babich, and senior Taylor Meehan finished off the game for Harvard, with Hulse representing the only member of the starting rotation. 
Nutter bore the majority of labor on the mound, throwing three solid innings amidst minor control problems.
Meehan (0-1) took the loss after watching a 10-8 lead dissolve into a one-run deficit, but the distribution of innings ensured that the Crimson’s rotation will arrive prepared for a weekend pair of doubleheaders.
STACK'S BACKAfter recent struggles at the plate relegated former cleanup hitter Stack-Babich to the seventh spot in the lineup, the senior slugger responded resoundingly to his new role. 
An early swinging strikeout left fans wondering if Stack-Babich would ever find the groove to makes him a force in the batter’s box, but the right-fielder dispelled concerns by blasting two hits against the Crusaders, including a mammoth two-run shot over the centerfield fence. Holy Cross pitchers also hit the slugger twice, allowing Stack to reach base in four of his five plate appearences.
“Everyone knows Stack is a great hitter,” Douglas said. “When he gets his pitch he can drive it over the fence on any swing. We’re expecting him to continue to contribute for us. He can explode at any time, really, so it’s good having him in the lineup.”
Stack-Babich added to his resurgence at the plate by flashing the leather in the outfield. The right fielder recorded the first and last outs of the ninth inning in spectacular fashion—chasing down a ball to make a spectacular sliding catch in foul territory, before gunning down a runner at the plate to preserve the deficit at one run.

Before entering college last fall, volleyball freshman Matt Jones set a goal for himself. “I definitely came in wanting to play right away,” Jones says. “I figured that if I come in and work hard, I would get my shot.”He certainly got much more than he wished for.As personal ambition turned into reality, Jones quickly transitioned from an anxious rookie to a regular starter who has become a dominating force on the court. His contributions have rejuvenated a Harvard team currently sitting atop the EIVA Hay Division standings and on the verge of making the playoffs for the first time in over five years. And while the upperclassmen deserve just as much credit for the program’s rapid resurgence, Jones has brought renewed enthusiasm to the team, as well as a skill set that has caught the attention of his teammates and coach.“I knew he’d come out of one of the top club programs in the country,” Crimson coach Brian Baise says. “The first thing I noticed was his attitude and approach; he is extremely hard working. It was clear how much he was looking forward to play. For a freshman, he plays an integral part on the team both on and off the court.”“Matt came in right away and showed us that he had amazing work ethic and a lot of heart,” co-captain Brady Weissbourd says. “He’s been a great teammate the entire time.”Signs of good things to come became apparent when Jones, in his first collegiate game against Springfield, accounted for seven kills and five digs. And while the promise of playing time drew Jones to the Crimson in the first place, the unexpected departure of prized recruit Nikola Ivica pushed the freshman further into the limelight and on to the front lines of a depleted team roster.Always the opportunist, Jones quickly relished his elevated role. “It doesn’t really matter to me where I play,” Jones says. “At the beginning of the season, Coach decided to play me at opposite [hitter]. That was fun. But ever since I got moved to outside hitter, I’ve had to have more responsibility. For the first game or two on the outside, I didn’t play that effectively, but since then, I think I’ve handled it pretty well.”Ever since that switch, Jones has earned respect from his teammates and coach for playing a strong supporting role behind Weissbourd. In fact, the freshman phenom is as versatile as they come, hitting a respectable .212 while notching 189 kills to go along with his 79 digs and 28 blocks on the season. In addition, Jones earned Hay Division Player of the Week honors eight games into the season after posting a match-high 15 kills in a losing effort to Princeton. “Matt is exactly what you look for in a player,” Weissbourd says. “He can play anywhere on the court. He’s a great all-around player and athlete—he’ll pass the ball and set as well as anyone else on the team. He can do it all.” “It’s a meritocracy,” Jones says. “If you can get on the court, the seniors will treat you like an upperclassman.”But that doesn’t mean Jones hasn’t been playing the role of freshman. Always humble and ready to learn, Jones listens whenever an upperclassman or coach has advice to give. “Erik [Kuld] helped me out earlier this year,” Jones says. “Little things like keeping my elbow higher have helped me a lot. I’ve had to get used to the bigger blocks, so the upperclassmen have been working with me on those adjustments.”We’ve worked a lot on his passing this year and he’s come a long way with that,” Baise says.Given Jones’s veteran-like performances on the court, it’s hard to imagine that the La Jolla, Calif., native did not begin playing volleyball until his freshman year of high school. “My mom played volleyball in high school, but growing up, I started playing basketball,” Jones says. “I didn’t really know much about volleyball, so I decided to try it out and play JV.”It quickly became clear, however, that Jones had more of a knack for spiking the ball than shooting it. Encouraged by his parents and coaches, the young player signed up for club volleyball and was soon noticed by college coaches. “I’d always wanted to play sports in college; I just realized that my chances were a lot better in volleyball than basketball,” Jones says.Like many kids on the West Coast, Jones set his sights on Stanford. But after being deferred in the early admissions process, he began to look at the Ivy League.“One day, I got a call from Harvard,” Jones says. “It was kind of funny because I didn’t know my parents sent my highlight DVD to Harvard. It wasn’t really in my mind.”In the end, the chance to receive more playing time as well as a renowned education was too good to turn down, and Jones arrived on campus ready to make a statement. So far, he has, and opponents and teammates alike have started to take notice.“Matt could be the best player in the world if he wanted it to be,” Weissbourd says. Then, he chuckles, before adding, “That’s a bold statement.”Bold indeed, but not inappropriate for a player like Jones. —Staff writer Kevin T. Chen can be reached at ktchen@fas.harvard.edu.

Offensive explosions in baseball often have the same effect as using bubblegum to plug up a leaky faucet.They can serve as a temporary fix, momentarily masking deficiencies and creating the illusion of a fundamentally sound operation.But as the Harvard baseball team found out yesterday, sharp line drives into the gaps and base-clearing home runs can only conceal shoddy defense and ineffective pitching for so long.The Crimson lineup scorched the ball in yesterday’s back-and-forth battle with Holy Cross at O’Donnell Field, but lackluster play on the mound and in the field ultimately doomed Harvard (4-17, 2-2 Ivy) to a disappointing 12-11 defeat.“When you get 13 hits and 11 runs and a team gives you five errors you take advantage of it,” Crimson coach Joe Walsh said. “I’m tired of being in slugfests and coming out on the short end of them.”In an ugly contest that featured five lead changes and runs scored in every inning, it quickly became evident that the game would be decided by whichever team managed to play the least flawed brand of baseball.It turned out to be the Crusaders.With the scored tied at 11 in the top of the ninth inning, a pair of singles and a walk loaded the bases with two outs for Holy Cross third baseman Matt Perry with Harvard senior Taylor Meehan on the mound. Perry laced a single into center field, bringing home Jake Gorman. The Crusaders’ Rob Dornfriend tried to score from second on the play, but was gunned down at home by Crimson senior right fielder Tom Stack-Babich to send the game into last licks.Down to its final three outs and facing a one-run deficit, Harvard seemed poised for another rally in the bottom of the ninth when Stack-Babich led off with a hard-hit single to right center and advanced to second on an error by the Holy Cross centerfielder. But the Crimson quickly racked up two outs on a pop-up and a strikeout, and after Stack-Babich reached third on a wild pitch and sophomore Dillon O’Neill walked, Meehan flew out harmlessly to right to end the game.“It was not a pretty game on either side,” Harvard captain Harry Douglas said. “The games like that you gotta do what you gotta do—you gotta win.”Douglas recalled the Crimson’s previous contest—a 15-11 victory over Penn—in which Harvard forced a tie with a three-run ninth before winning in eleven innings.“Our last game…was a similar game but we were able to get those runs in the last inning,” Douglas said “We didn’t get them today.”The Crimson started yesterday’s loss with a bang, courtesy of an increasingly familiar source of offensive firepower.After tying the game at one in the bottom of the second, Harvard filled the bases for senior left fielder Matt Rogers. On the first pitch he saw, Rogers blasted a grand slam straight down the left-field line to give him six home runs and 23 RBI on the season, totals which are tied for first and second in the Ivy League, respectively.“We had the bases loaded and when we saw Matty coming to the plate, we were feeling pretty good about that with the way he’s been playing,” Douglas said.But the Crimson pitching staff couldn’t hold up its end of the bargain. Freshman Conner Hulse pitched a relatively clean third frame, giving up just a run on two hits and striking out a pair of batters, but senior Adam Cole and sophomore Anthony Nutter combined to allow four runs in the fourth to give the Crusaders the lead back.Down 7-5 in the fifth, Harvard roared back on the strength of a two-run homer by Stack-Babich and later took a 10-8 lead in the bottom of the seventh.But Meehan, who took the mound in relief in the eighth, struggled as Holy Cross scored three runs in the frame to go up, 11-10. Meehan gave up three hits and walked two batters in the inning and hurt his own cause with a throwing error.The Crimson returned to the plate to force yet another tie, but the Crusaders’ final run in the top of the ninth proved to be the fatal blow for Harvard.Following the game, Walsh acknowledged that while the Crimson’s offense has thrived on big blasts from its powerful sluggers, the team is in need of a return to fundamentals if it hopes to achieve any lasting success.“We gotta make some adjustments,” he said. “Making contact at the right time is more important—being able to play both the short game and the long ball. We can’t count on home run balls leaving the yard every ballgame to win it.”—Staff writer Loren Amor can be reached at lamor@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If there was ever a year to beat Cornell, this is it. For the past ten years, the Big Red men’s lacrosse team has crushed Harvard, last year winning soundly, 11-7.But tomorrow at Schoellkopf Field in Ithaca, N.Y., No. 3 Cornell (6-1, 2-0 Ivy) faces a No. 13 Crimson (5-2, 1-0) team that has already defeated then-No.7 Duke, and is coming off of a 17-2 victory against Presbyterian last Friday. This Harvard team is more than ready to knock the Big Red down.“We’re good to go,” co-captain Nick Smith said. “[We’re] not worrying so much about what the name on their jersey is, but just playing our game.”In the 81-game history between these two Ancient Eight schools, the Crimson has won only 28 matchups. But this year, a Harvard team that has been ranked as high as No. 11 nationally is hoping for a win before taking on league rivals Princeton and Brown in the next two weeks.  “It’s a really important game,” co-captain Max Gottschall said. “We didn’t bring our best game to the table last year, so we are really looking forward to it. It sets the tone for our season and the next big games.”The Crimson is 1-1 against ranked teams, defeating Duke in February but then falling, 7-3, to then-No. 19 Massachusetts two weeks later. While Harvard will attempt to secure another win against a ranked team, the Crimson will also look to tally another win away from home, bettering its road record of 3-1.   For Harvard, Saturday’s game will provide a test in strength between the two Ivy League offenses. “We just have to play our game,” Smith said. “One of their big tactics is to come right out and sort of intimidate their opponents right off the bat. But one of the things we’ve been working on this year is coming right out with a lot of energy and excitement.”This season, the Crimson has outscored its opponents, 78-39, and has outshot teams by a count of 263-157. But Cornell ranks second in the country in goals per game (13.86) and has junior attack Ryan Hurley, the nation’s leading scorer with 3.67 goals per game.While Harvard will have to watch out for the offensive prowess of Hurley, who scored five goals against Penn last week, and senior midfielder Max Seibald, the Big Red will have their hands full with the Crimson’s defense. Considered one of the best defenses in the country, the team of Gottschall, junior Ben Smith, senior Eric Posner, and senior goalie Joe Pike has yet to give up more than eight goals in a game this season. “We’re just looking to play our style of defense,” Gottschall said. “[Cornell doesn’t] really run that many offense sets, I guess, so we are just going to communicate and play with a sense of urgency. It’s an important game for the defense.”Pike especially will see a lot of action on Saturday, but the senior is more than prepared. So far this season, Pike has come up with 43 saves, and is ranked ninth on the all-time Harvard list with 359 stopped shots. His 5.52 goals-against average is tops in the nation.If all goes well, Harvard’s midfield and defense will be able to prevent an aggressive Big Red offense from getting anywhere near Pike’s goal.“We’re going to try to focus on picking up our ground balls the first time, opposed to sort of missing them,” Smith said. “We’ve had a lot of focus on our clears this week. The clearing game is going to be very important. They are very aggressive riders, so hopefully we will be able to make all of the right smart plays and clear the ball.”But despite technique and aggression, the main ingredient Harvard will need is the right mindset. “It all depends on who shows up on Saturday playing their best game,” Gottschall said. “It’s always fun to play the best. That’s what we look forward to do.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At first glance, it seems like an ordinary pair of league doubleheaders. But with Princeton coming to town this weekend, the Harvard softball team has something to prove.
“We always get up for Princeton, but this year especially, we’ll definitely be out for revenge,” co-captain Bailey Vertovez said. “We want to score in that first, second inning, and show them that we’re a better team than we were last year. They’ve already had two losses, so we want to hand them two more.”
The Tigers (7-11, 2-2 Ivy) unceremoniously ended the Crimson’s (17-7, 3-1) season with a two-game sweep of the Ivy League Championship Series last May. Now, Harvard has Princeton just where it wants it: in Cambridge.
“We’re just really excited to get on our home field, having our fans there, hopefully having a lot of good support,” co-captain Hayley Bock said. “I’ve had to play Princeton and Cornell away for the last three years, so I’m really excited to have this rivalry at home.”
The Crimson and Tigers open their twinbill on Sunday at 12:30 p.m. on Soldiers Field, but first Harvard will take on league-leading Cornell (25-5, 4-0) in a pair of games tomorrow. The first pitch is scheduled for 12:30 p.m.
The Big Red rolls into the weekend winners of 14 straight, including a dominating four-game sweep of Yale and Brown last weekend, in which Cornell outscored its opponents, 33-5. 
“Cornell’s always a huge rivalry for us,” Vertovez said. “The way that we play is completely different from our style—they have more of a baseball style.”
The Big Red’s potent offense is powered by juniors Elise Menaker and Ashley Garvey. Menaker is hitting .384 through 28 games with five homers and 28 RBI, and has taken home Ivy League Player of the Week honors twice already this season. 
Garvey, the reigning Ivy Player of the Week, leads the team in hits, dingers and RBI, with 34, six and 32, respectively. In Cornell’s opening Ivy weekend, she hit .615 with two home runs and two doubles.
The Crimson will counter with the Ivy League Pitcher of the Week, freshman Rachel Brown, who will lead the pitching staff as it tries to shut the Big Red bats down.
Brown has been dominant through the first half of her rookie season, coming into the weekend with an 11-1 record, a 1.00 ERA, and 124 strikeouts—a total that puts her tied for tenth on the Harvard career list. 
In her first two Ivy tests, Brown sparkled, starting with a complete-game, one-hit shutout of Columbia and following up with another win at Penn. For the weekend, she struck out 26 while allowing just one run on eight hits.
“We think Rachel will be a great matchup for [Cornell], because her ball goes up while they swing down,” Vertovez said. “We hope [she] will give us two more stellar performances on the mound, quiet their bats, and make it fun to watch.”
Equally important to the Crimson’s success this weekend will be its ability to find its offensive rhythm. While Harvard’s hitters struggled to produce runs against Columbia, the team found its stride against Penn, with every starter recording at least one hit in the doubleheader. The Crimson continued to roll yesterday against Rhode Island, ripping off 21 hits in a twinbill sweep.
“Our pitching and defense keeps us in games, but our offense needs to win it,” Bock said. “We need to make sure that everyone has quality at-bats, and we just need to string the hits together and hopefully score a lot of runs, so on defense we can play even more relaxed.”
Rookie first baseman Whitney Shaw leads the team with a .317 average, while four Harvard sluggers have already reached double digits in RBI. Junior center fielder Stephanie Krysiak, who is also a Crimson sports editor, has been on fire of late, hitting .526 last week to earn a place on the Ivy League Honor Roll.
Harvard’s offense will look to exploit Princeton’s weaknesses in the circle. With the graduation of Kristen Schaus, last year’s Ivy Pitcher of the Year, the Tigers have been relying on just two hurlers, junior Jamie Lettire and sophomore Michelle Tolfa, to carry the team.
On the offensive end, senior Kathryn Welch paces Princeton with a .453 average, 29 hits, and 19 RBI.
But no matter who’s in the other dugout, or how much history there is to settle, the Crimson is focusing on the one thing it can control: its own play.
“I think being fearful of an opponent isn’t beneficial, [and] seeing that an opponent has lost a bunch of games can make you overconfident or play down to a team’s level,” Bock said. “I just try to focus on Harvard softball. As long as we do that and keep the game at our own pace, we’ll be successful against any opponent.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the heels of Monday’s two victories at Penn, Harvard (17-7, 3-1 Ivy League) won its first two home games of the season in commanding fashion. Playing a doubleheader against Rhode Island (7-22), the Crimson was victorious in the first game, 6-0, and won the nightcap, 10-3. Harvard’s continuing strong defensive play, as well as a resurrected offense, helped secure both wins. In Harvard’s two previous doubleheaders, players had failed to score more than five runs, and Coach Jenny Allard was happy to see the team’s offense come alive. “We were solid today,” Allard said. “I think we came out really aggressive offensively. It was nice to see us stay in our swing and not be over anxious.”The Crimson players were undoubtedly excited to be playing in front of their home fans for the first time this season. “Oh my gosh! That was so cool!” said freshman Rachel Brown, the Ivy League Pitcher and Rookie of the Week. “When I came on my recruiting trip, I pictured being out on this field. It was really exciting, and having our fans here was really cool.” HARVARD 10, RHODE ISLAND 3Following its first game victory, the Crimson took the field looking to sweep the Rams. After falling behind 1-0 in the top of the first inning, the Crimson rallied in the bottom of the frame, scoring two runs, aided by three Rhode Island errors.In the bottom of the second inning, freshman Jane Alexander scored on sophomore Ellen Macadam’s double down the left field line to increase Harvard’s lead to 3-1. Junior Jennifer Francis collected an RBI in third, before helping home junior Melissa Schellberg, who is also a Crimson sports editor, by distracting the Rams in a rundown.Rhode Island put two runs on the board in the fifth inning, courtesy of Courtney Prendergastt’s deep two-run home run with two outs, cutting Harvard’s lead to 5-3. The Crimson, however, answered with a prolific attack in the bottom-half of the inning.Freshman Whitney Shaw led off with a double off the centerfield fence and scored on Schellberg’s single up the middle, which ricocheted off of the pitcher’s glove. With Schellberg still on the base paths, Francis stepped up to the plate and drove a ball over the wall in dead center field to give Harvard an 8-3 lead. For Francis, the home run was the tenth of her Crimson career, moving her into tenth place on Harvard’s career home run list and equaling her place on the Crimson’s all-time RBI list—a mark she reached in the day’s first contest.“I didn’t even know [of my standing],” Francis said. “I couldn’t have done it without my teammates. They just pump me up.”“Jen’s been having some great at bats lately so it was nice to see her today really connect and get a hold of one,” Allard added. “She’s an offensive spark for us.”Harvard added two more runs in the inning, to bring its lead to 10-3 and both teams went scoreless in the sixth and seventh to finish the game.HARVARD 6, RHODE ISLAND 0In the first game of the doubleheader, the Crimson offense struck first in the third inning. Macadam singled to center field to drive in sophomore Emily Henderson, but the Harvard bats were not finished. With two outs in the inning, Schellberg doubled in two runs and was driven in herself by Francis’ double to left field. Harvard took the field in the top-half of the fourth inning ahead 4-0—a comfortable lead with Brown on the mound. The rookie phenom continued her dominance as a starter, pitching four scoreless innings, allowing two hits and striking out nine. “I felt good going out, and I had a few days off leading up to this, so I felt pretty sharp,” Brown said. “We limited innings and let all the pitchers pitch in preparation for this coming weekend.”In the bottom of the fourth and with two outs, Macadam singled in junior Stephanie Krysiak, who is also a Crimson sports editor, and advanced to third base on an overthrow. Shaw then doubled in Macadam to give Harvard a 6-0 lead, the final score of the game. Freshman Marika Zumbro pitched a scoreless fifth inning for Harvard, and junior Margaux Black closed out the game with two no-hit innings.The Crimson now prepares for its weekend doubleheaders against Ivy League rivals Cornell and Princeton.“We’re just going to play our game and stay within ourselves,” Francis said. “They’re big opponents, but if we play our game we’ll be great.”

If you are one of the more forgetful Harvard students, getting dinner just got a lot harder—unless you're good at sneaking in. Starting this Friday, HUDS will no longer let students into dining halls without their IDs.
Since November, when students began using the small stripe on their IDs for dining halls, swipers have had backup cards on hand to let in those who forgot/lost/never had an ID. But now, these poor souls will starve. And since the small stripe is not associated with Harvard PINs, reciting that 8-digit number will do you no good.
If there is one upside to this restriction, it is that you will never have to explain to Domna why and how you forgot your ID card anymore. FlyBy remembers a time when he was too lazy to buy a new ID card for two days and had to give Domna the whole story each time. Of course it isn’t hard to get into the backdoor of Annenberg, and most of you freshmen have become experts at sneaking into Adams for a quick bite (Sorry Adams, it's true).
FlyBy implores all of you to head to the  9th floor of the Holyoke Center and just shell out for a new-style ID. We hear they come in handy for things like...getting back into your House, for instance.

We at FlyBy never want to leave anyone (especially a 2012er!) out alone in the VOID.  It can be a scary place.  Trust us, we're here for you (unless we're out getting bombed...).
We hope your April Fool's went well.  FlyBy, of course, was not fooled by anyone--many attempted, none succeeded (we will confirm our enviable stash of GOLD, but refrain from discussing how it's put to use).  For all of you, we present (to those who haven't seen it), the famed College Humor Prank War, which finally updated recently with a new prank.  How else to keep your brain alive in tonight's VOID?

Daydreaming about Harvard in high school, you may have imagined wood-panel rooms lined with dozens of Gutenberg Bibles and the busts of ancient Greek philosophers—a haven where students would absorb knowledge from the mere scent of the ancient books surrounding them. Uhhhh...maybe not.  Maybe you just smoked pot or played the sousaphone.  But anyway, you'll grant FlyBy that studying at Harvard is not quite the stuff of dreams (especially in the early morning).  That's where the House libraries come in.  Many replicate a sense of history and wood-panelled beauty that was all you ever thought Harvard would be (minus the parties). Thus, without further ado, here is your guide to Harvard’s six finest House libraries (with pics) after the jump.
Dunster
Although few frequent the Dunster House Library, it is without question the finest House library on campus. Tucked away on the second floor of B entryway, it is the only House library that regularly plays host to chamber music concerts. And while most libraries have just a grand piano, it boasts of a harpsichord.  Yeah, that's right.  A harpsichord.  Suck it, Adams. Moreover, while the most exotic literature at some House libraries hails from France, Dunster’s library has the best selection of texts on campus, claiming Chinese literature in the original and even a massive ancient Greek dictionary that lies eternally open. There are eleven stacked shelves in the Dunster library, which necessitates a ladder to access books on the top rows. Below a low-hanging chandelier, there is even a Latin inscription specially written for the library: bibliothecae aedium Dunsteranium pristinae (of the venerable/ancient library of the Dunster Dwelling...er House), which was given in the year MDCCCCXXX (1930). Very sweet.
The only downside: the library's only open 12-4 on Friday and Saturday. But getting the chance to gaze at the view of the Charles River from the wide window, however briefly, is cause enough to trek over to Dunster’s library from another House on a Saturday afternoon.  Freshmen placed in Dunster: do not despair of your future living in a walk-through next year. Just a tunnel walk away from your room will be a library that takes your breath away.
Eliot
Few libraries compare to Dunster’s, but Eliot’s House library is comparable in beauty and can also boast of more space and much more reasonable hours. (The curator is often generous enough to keep it open till 1 AM on Saturday night.) The grand piano at the center is less useful than the harpsichord and grand piano in Dunster’s library, where there are actually concerts—so the piano just kind of sits there. I’m not entirely sure if any drunk people have wandered from C entryway into the library on a Saturday night to play each other Chopin, but that seems to be the only context in which it would come to use.
In addition to cozy red chairs and couches, the best part of the library is a well-lit reading room tucked away in the back corner, where you can bring together a study group for discussion. If you’re there by yourself, it’s also lovely to gaze at the Latin and Greek classics as well as more exotic volumes like The Thousand and One Nights.
Winthrop
Winthrop lays claim to a special kind of beauty unique from all other River House libraries. Like the dining hall, it is underground, but cozier that way. The green couches are the puffiest in any House library. And getting to walk down the stairs into the library gives the studier a sense of purpose. At least a dozen original portraits line the walls of the library, all depicting men and a woman with the last name Winthrop. Three of them are named John Winthrop, and a fourth is John Stills Winthrop.
However, the library refuses to stay open when there is no librarian on guard because the portraits are so valuable. Its hours on Friday, perhaps, are most ridiculous—it is open only 5-8 PM. Most House libraries have terrible hours on Fridays and Saturdays, though.
Adams
Tired of Draconian hours at most House libraries, and even at Lamont? Adams is here to open its welcoming arms, saving countless undergrads driven out by Lamont’s shrill 9:45 PM bell. On a Friday or Saturday night, they can simply walk to Adams. Although Adams is not the best place to study during a dining hall party, in most cases it provides an ideal haven for refugees from other Houses. So, thank you, Adams.
Lowell
Lowell may be smaller than most House libraries, with a mere three modestly sized tables. But it is still one of the most elegant River House libraries on campus. A wood panel engraving of the Lowell shield—the hand seizing the arrows, encapsulating the motto occasionem cognosce (seize the moment)—gazes on studious Lowellians. The selection of literature on the bottom floor celebrates a special focus on obscure English literature that no one reads anymore (a defect present in many other River House libraries, including Winthrop).
Walk up the ladder to the stacks tucked away in the back, and find a treasure-trove of the most fascinating old books.  The air reeks of old paper. One can find anything in the Lowell stacks: a manual of economic history, a bound volume of Plato in ancient Greek, a polemic from a Latin professor at Princeton 100 years ago on why study of the classics in the original Latin and Greek should remain required for all college students. Those stairs—though rickety—are an unforgettable portal to the past.
Kirkland
Kirkland’s Hicks House Library is the only House library restricted to House residents, but do not despair. It is possible to sneak in, and well worth it. Not only is the library unique for possessing 10 small study rooms lining two winding staircases, but it is also a standing monument to Harvard history. Sketches and photographs of Harvard presidents from Eliot to Conant hang in one study room. An original sketch of Walden Pond by Thoreau’s hand hangs on the wall of another. The photographs of all of Kirkland’s past House masters line the staircases. Kirkland’s selection of books is also exquisite, with the Loeb Greek and Latin classics in one room, more exotic Chinese history in another, and historical theory on the third floor. Indeed, the Hicks House Library is a microcosm of Harvard itself: intellectual, studious, and exclusive—but not impossible to gain access to.

The University just announced that Energy Secretary Steven Chu, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist, will be this year's Commencement speaker.  Not a huge surprise, considering Harvard's new green initiative and Al Gore's recent speech in Tercentenary Theatre.  Green is the new Crimson, baby. But although Harvard is digging that Chu is a passionate advocate for renewable energy, his passion for academics went somewhat...unappreciated by the Ivy Leagues in an earlier go-round.  In his autobiography on the Nobel Prize web site, he writes of how he was rejected by all the Ivy League schools he applied to--including, FlyByBlog presumes, Harvard, where two cousins were attending.  The relevant passage after the jump:
"I applied to a number of colleges in the fall of my senior year," Chu writes, "but because of my relatively lackluster A-average in high school, I was rejected by the Ivy League schools, but was accepted at Rochester. By comparison, my older brother was attending Princeton, two cousins were in Harvard and a third was at Bryn Mawr.... As I prepared to go to college, I consoled myself that I would be an anonymous student, out of the shadow of my illustrious family."
Who's illustrious now, Chu family?

Last night, Leverett HoCo announced that the Spring Formal will be held in Leverett. Big woop. Formal veterans have perfected dancing under big white tents and turned open bars in courtyards into an art form.
But the controversy, the drama, the intrigue around Lev’s formal goes far deeper than that.  Love, democracy, betrayal, financial woes, and  the uber-fancy Top of the Hub all played into this story.  Find out more about this soap opera after the jump.
As eager rabbits started contemplating ideas for Spring Formal, the idea of holding it at Top of the Hub, at the zenith of the Prudential Tower--“the premiere location in Boston" according to one Leverett resident--quickly gained attention and popularity.
The Top of the Hub formal plan included shuttles between Lev and the Hub, an ultra-elegant food spread, and, of course, a jaw-dropping view of the Boston skyline. The catch? The Hub formal ticket price was set to cost $30, twice as much as an in-house formal. Not to mention, there would be no open bar…yikes.
HoCo sent out TWO formal questionnaires (the first was deemed “inconclusive” by resident polling experts.)  On the second pass, Top of the Hub won by a hair's breadth, with 52 percent of the vote (150 people).  In-house had 48 percent of the vote (136 people). But HoCo opted to ignore the majority ruling, deciding to conduct an in-house formal anyway, because it was more “economically feasible."  Ahh, how the noble instrument of democracy is scorned!
Distressed rabbits complained of HoCo’s disorganization and tyrannical-like disregard for majority vote. One resident griped, “I just don’t get what the point of a vote was if we were not going to make a decision based on the results of that vote.” Another called the survey “deceptive and disappointing,” and accused HoCo of “holding a sham survey to try and get a mandate for a predecided course of action (holding the formal in Lev) and reneging when the results didn’t go as planned.”   In response, HoCo issued an apology for the confusion of having two surveys and dispelled the notions of HoCo dictatorship, claiming to have Lev unity in mind and citing financial obstacles and low survey participation rate (286 out of about 650 Leverites) as problems.
One wise rabbit had a reminder both for in-house formal defenders and those ready to give HoCo a good pre-formal flogging: “Guys, it is just a dance.”  Sure.  You can say that again.  A dance that’ll take place in a musky library instead of 52 stories above the city.

Many eager high schoolers look for a Harvard Admissions loophole.  We at FlyBy aim to please, and found a sweet hack on the Admitted Students website, but, sadly, it still probably can't turn a thin envelope into a thick one.
It does raise some questions about how secure that admissions info is, but we have little time for such trivialities—let's get to the fun part!
Our trick lets you figure out with high certainty whether that friend, relative, or nemesis got into Harvard, particularly if he/she has an uncommon last name. Oh yeah, it's way better than you think.
Step-by-step:
1. Visit the Admitted Students website.
2. In the "Last Name" field, type in the last name of the person whose admissions lottery results you're after.
3. Type something in the "Access Number" field—this can be literally anything, it just can't be blank.
(The payoff, after the jump!)
4. Click submit.
5. Your thought process: "Okay, I got an error message. WTF, Flyby?  I was dying to know whether Aaron V. Pennyworth IV, whose dad wants to rename Pennypacker, was able to pay down that C average."
Patience, friends.  What matters is the nature of the error message.
If no one with that last name got into Harvard, you'll get the "User not found" error message (e.g. "Bismarck," above).  If you get this, the person did not get in, with absolute certainty.  They may have gotten waitlisted, but they ain't got the fat envelope.
If someone with this last name did get accepted, you'll get "Incorrect ACCESS CODE" (e.g. Chu, to the right). Obviously, judging this result is a little more tricky. If you put in "Smith," this may or may not mean your Smith will be wandering Harvard Yard in a couple of weeks.  If you put in "Pennyworth," odds are pretty good that Aaron will be setting the bottom of the curve in Ec 10 next year.  The commonality of the last name matters a lot here, and it's up to you to judge.
So, 2013, stalk stalk stalk and tell your friends!  Hack the system before Harvard seals it up.  This crack has worked since at least 2006, so we doubt Admissions will be able to fix it too quickly, but hit that as soon as possible so you can saunter into class, smug in the knowledge that that insufferable Michael Gary in your math class won't be joining you at the a cappella jam in a couple of weeks.  Until you find out it's Michael Gehry.  Then you'd best check again.
