After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Santo António,” an art installation currently exhibited in Radcliffe Yard’s Byerly Hall, consists of four screens that each cover a side of a room. The mesmerizing short film “Morning of Saint Anthony’s Day” is projected simultaneously on all screens with variations between each one, forming an endless fugue enclosed in a 200-square-foot universe.
Portuguese filmmaker João Pedro Rodrigues, known for daring films such as “Two Drifters” and “To Die Like a Man,” created the piece in 2013 as a commissioned work for Mimesis Art Museum in South Korea. It was intended as an installation version of his “Morning of Saint Anthony’s Day,” which had premiered a year earlier at the Cannes Film Festival.
The original 25-minute short focuses on a group of young people as they get out of a subway station near the St. Anthony statue in Lisbon, numb and exhausted after the immoderate festivities of St. Anthony’s Night. “St. Anthony’s Day is a religious day because St. Anthony is the patron of Lisbon,” Rodrigues explains. “But people do a vulgar celebration, which is to go out, drink and get drunk...so there are two sides of the same day which are conflicted.” On one hand, the youth rebel against the constraints of religion and the establishment, which is epitomized by a young man trying to break the statue of St. Anthony. At the same time, however, these people don’t know where their rebellion leads. In the film, they wander around like sleepwalkers and end up lost in hollowness and helplessness. “But who’s looking at those people? St. Antonio himself,” Rodrigues says. “He is a silent observer, looking at these people, and he can’t fully understand them.”
The short film is typical of Rodrigues’s works both thematically and stylistically. Deeply concerned with social issues, Rodrigues utilizes films to voice his concern about marginalized groups and neglected political problems. “There’s nothing that is completely not political,” Rodrigues says. “For example, my first film was about gay characters, and there had never been a film in Portugal about gay characters.”
Another feature of Rodrigues’s films is that they don’t convey his thoughts through words as much as through visuals. Heavily influenced by American silent cinema and French art house film, Rodrigues views films as essentially a visual art about space and time. “It’s super lazy just to tell stories through words,” Rodrigues says. In the silent era, directors did not use words, but they could still tell a complex and engaging story because they discovered and polished a visual language that used the unique qualities of film to the greatest effect. Rodrigues has been exploring this language, and in “Morning of Saint Anthony’s Day,” there is almost no dialogue. To emphasize the sense of apathy and confusion, he lets the young people in the film walk mechanically and rhythmically, like characters in works of Buster Keaton and Pina Bausch.
However, “Santo António” is different from “Morning of St. Anthony’s Day.” As a piece of installation art, it has its own language. “It’s much more architectural,” Rodrigues says. He tries to incorporate the characteristic of the media with the theme of the film. “The idea of the film is about these young men and young women going out of the square. The four screens are the four sides of the square, and the whole room is a recreation of the square.” At the center of this reconstructed square, audiences are actually looking from the viewpoint of the statue of St. Anthony, observing the young people as they walk out at all directions further and further away from the square and from each other. The relation in physical space helps to establish the psychological distance between characters. Rodrigues also tries to convey the sense of alienation through space configuration, as the the display of images inside four walls creates a claustrophobic situation.
“Santo António” will be on exhibition through Dec. 4. Isolated in the Johnson-Kulukundis Family Gallery of Byerly Hall, it will be playing Rodrigues’s melancholic video essay about the modern generation over and over until the exhibit’s closing.

Google Glass, despite (or perhaps because of) seeming like something out of an overly optimistic 1960s vision of a technocratic future, has always been seen as a nerdy accessory appropriate solely for tech insiders. The spectacles have even been the repeated targets of smashings, due largely to tensions around the tech industry and gentrification. In FKA Twig’s  new video, however, the R&B star (and yes, Robert Pattinson’s girlfriend) makes them seem almost hip.
Twigs wrote, starred, and directed this promotion video for Google Glass. The gadget is currently in open beta testing and available for $1,500 online (they’ll throw in Diane Von Furstenberg frames for free though—what a bargain!). The video shows Twigs telling Glass to play her song “Video Girl,” a classic whispery and dreamy Twigs track from her latest album “LP1,” hitting the side of Glass dramatically when she’s done instructing them. Some of the video is a bizarre version of a mirror selfie using the camera in Glass (I think she just won the selfie olympics).
From there, Twigs transitions the video into an impressive dance, battling people who look quite similar to her. They sport her characteristic gelled-down baby hairs (or as the fashion industry would say, “urban fabulous hair”). As they approach her, she uses the Glass to search various styles of contemporary dance and replicates them remarkably. Before she was Twigs, she was Tahliah Barnett, a backup dancer in videos by people like Jessie J and Kylie Minogue, so her dancing prowess is not surprising. Some have critiqued her for vogueing, a style invented and usually performed by trans women and gay men in the ballroom scene. However, she searches iconic voguer Benjamin Milan  on YouTube at one point in the video, which offsets the potential appropriation of the act.
Though her movements with the Glass are a little awkward at times, Twigs makes it work with her image. She always likes things to be a little bit off, like her video for “Water Me,” where her oversized eyes are just big enough to be surreal and creepy. She is definitely not your basic video vixen (not that there’s anything wrong with them; do your thang ladies!). Instead, she infuses everything she does with a "dainty cyborg" aesthetic. Her niche is fully her own. “Through Glass” is Twigs at her best, showing off her talents in singing, dancing, directing, and, perhaps most importantly, self-marketing.
After viewing makeup tutorials on the Glass to draw on huge anime eyes, Twigs suddenly rips off her glasses and reveals replicas on her eyelids. Does such a progression make sense? Not particularly. But the imagery is aesthetically pleasing, the dancing is incredibly impressive and the video succeeds in its commercial goal—Glass has been taken out of the realm of nerdery and may have even made its way into hipness. And you thought those iPad commercials were cool.

Bertholt Brecht’s magnum opus, “Mother Courage and her Children,” was forged amidst the fires of mounting war in Europe. Brecht completed the play in 1939, the same year Hitler invaded Poland; an ardent socialist, that year also saw the already-exiled playwright relocate yet again, from Denmark to Sweden, in an attempt to keep one step ahead of the Wehrmacht. “Mother Courage” was indelibly shaped by the trauma of the times that produced it—Anna (Margaret A. Nyland), the hardscrabble owner of an army canteen, trundles her wagon from camp to camp while the war on whose back she makes a living exacts its own terrible price on her family. Said to have been completed in little over a month following a burst of inspiration, the play is a searing condemnation of war and its profiteers.But in the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production of “Mother Courage,” which ran at Farkas Hall from Oct. 30 to Nov. 1, Brecht’s fire was reduced to little more than a meager flicker.
While technical and directorial issues numbered among the production’s problems, the nail in the coffin was the play’s lead actress. Anna (AKA Mother Courage) is a war-hardened fast-talker, a stranger to peacetime and a perpetual wanderer of Europe’s battlefields. With the 30 Years’ War reaching fever pitch, Mother Courage tries desperately—and ultimately, vainly—to keep her children, Eilif (Andrew F. Miner ’18), Swiss Cheese (Hunter A. Merryman ’18), and Kattrin (Elana P. Simon ’18), from being sucked into the very conflict that helps her put food on the table. Yet Nyland proved largely incapable of conveying either her character’s hard-learned pragmatism or her fiercely protective streak; when army recruiters (Lethu A. Ntshinga ’18 and Joshuah B. Campbell ’16) threaten to conscript one of her sons, the most Nyland could muster was to limply brandish a knife in a manner hardly suggestive of jeopardy to life and limb. Nyland delivered her lines without irony or pathos, devoid of the cynicism so characteristic of Brecht’s work (“Song of the Insufficiency of Human Struggling” from “The Threepenny Opera” providing perhaps one of the clearest examples). Nor did the technical side of things help alleviate the flatness of the acting: when her second son is executed, for example, Mother Courage’s face is entirely obscured by shadow. If there was any emotion to be read there, the audience certainly couldn’t see it.
At its worst, acting and directorial missteps combined to present a reading of the play so bizarre that it could only have been unintentional. Near the play’s outset, Mother Courage predicts the future of her children by drawing lots—piece of paper with a black cross means death, while a blank slip means life. In a choice that must have sounded good on paper, director Alistair A. Debling ’16 had a cameraman film Mother Courage live as she drew black crosses on each slip (to ensure for practical purposes that each actor would receive the doomed mark) and then projected the footage for the viewers to see. But by revealing this artifice, Debling inadvertently made it seem as though Mother Courage were deliberately consigning each of her children to death rather than presenting a true game of chance. Worse, Nyland’s remote reaction every time one of the children pulled out a black cross made Mother Courage’s grief feel sarcastic instead of sincere. The confused execution of the scene cast a shadow over the rest of the play, rendering cryptic Mother Courage’s desire to protect a family that mere moments ago she had seemed utterly indifferent towards.
This is not to say, however, that the production was a lost cause. Campbell, a member of the Harvard Krokodiloes, delivered heartfelt renditions of the opening and closing songs (the haunting original music was composed by Debling). And as the opportunistic chaplain who accompanies Mother Courage, Paris K. Ellsworth ’15 possessed the requisite sanctimoniousness and a sonorous voice put to good use in Debling’s score. Sam R. Peinado ’15, playing the wily army chef who briefly shacks up with Mother Courage, was perhaps the best at channeling the work’s grim humor. Nor was Nyland’s performance universally weak, succeeding in Mother Courage’s quieter moments—scenes of resignation, introspection, private grief. All this is not enough, however, to shoulder the weight of a play that approaches three hours in length. Outstripped by its own ambitions, the production tried but largely failed to capture the soul of Brecht’s bitter, sardonic script.

You know the scene: Your churning cranium beginning to settle after a breakneck physics lecture, you conserve energy through the Science Center’s revolving door and are greeted by a fellow student sporting a colorful flyer and a smile. You grimace and avoid eye contact in a calculated display of disinterest, but to no avail. The student hands you a flyer, you thank him and pocket it, and you say you’re pretty sure you have something that night, but you’ll check your calendar. 200 feet later, the flyer sits among its brothers at the bottom of a recycling bin.
Students on both ends of a flyer exchange do not make a meaningful connection. A tremendous waste of paper, flyering is rarely more than a brusque, sometimes even rude five-second-long exchange in which students grab flyers on the move, barely waiting to hear the time and place of an event before they enter the Science Center.
By all accounts, flyering is decidedly ineffective at generating student interest in on-campus events. Flyering’s goal is to reach as many of the throng of students by the Science Center as possible; this approach emphasizes quantity, not quality, and it is this fatal flaw that renders flyering ineffective. In fact, flyering suggests a fundamental flaw in the way that student groups—perhaps even students—connect with their peers. It is time that organizations reimagine the way that they publicize to the student body, from concerts to discussions to recruitment.
The best networks of connections, in student relationships and in organizational ones, are characterized not by the size of the network, but rather by the strength of the connections. Students who put more time into cultivating fewer friendships, making it possible for them to follow up on productive or interesting lunches in dining halls, have a richer network of connections than a student with many friends but not enough time to devote to them. Likewise, organizations should seek to form relationships with students that extend beyond mass-produced publicity emails sent over dorm lists and meaningless handoffs of flyers. Organizations should form relationships in the same way that students do, with a focus on developing quality relationships with the student body that grow over time.
The strongest connections that students make with each other are experiential, based in bonding that is exciting in the moment and creates vivid memories for the future. Organizations seeking to foster meaningful relationships should strive to create these bonding experiences among the student body as well, and depart from the overdone and forgettable approaches that are staples of organizational outreach today.
How can organizations achieve this goal? Organizational outreach should be liaison-based: Student ambassadors, not flyers, should connect the organization with its audience. These ambassadors should help organizations embark on a program of experiential outreach by implementing a representative system that allows students to experience membership in an organization as a method of recruitment.
For example, faith and discussion based groups could send a student representative to dining halls with the purpose of prompting thoughtful conversation. These dialogues could serve to illustrate what a typical discussion at a group event might look like, and might result in increased student interest after their participation. Though the outreach effort might only reach a small group of students, these students would be more likely to attend—and perhaps more likely to become active members of the organization.
Performance groups that seek to draw large crowds could also benefit from an overhauled publicity approach. While publically available posters with performance dates and times would still be necessary, performance groups could develop a more dedicated and dependable following by giving students small samples of a performance prior to a show. Dance groups could give sneak previews in the Science Center Plaza, as some already do, while vocalists might perform small sections of their repertoire in a public space. Performance groups might elicit more popular interest if they intrigued an audience before a show as well as during it.
However the changes are made, the impersonal nature that is the current outreach model for most Harvard clubs could benefit from a shift in focus. Instead of trying to inform as many students as possible about an event, organizations might be better served by impassioning a more aerodynamic body of students, creating fewer, perhaps, but increasingly ardent subscribers to an organization’s activities.
Organizations are unlikely make the change to a more personal outreach approach quickly; in fact, many may keep to the current model of mass produced outreach for the foreseeable future. But organizations looking to provide a boost to their attendance figures could look to this more customizable approach to invigorate attendance. With a more invested base of supporters, these student groups might be able to leapfrog to the vanguard of public relations, bolstering both attendance at group events and the organization’s standing on campus.

When former CEO of Goldman Sachs and Secretary of the Treasury Henry M. Paulson visited the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum in early October and claimed that the U.S. has one of the most efficient banking sectors, I could not help thinking that that might be true for investment bankers and other big players, but it most certainly is not for the regular customer.
That same morning I had stood with an overdrawn account in one city and a paycheck in my hand in the city I had recently moved to—without any way to bring those two together. My old bank did not have a physical presence in Boston, and even as a post-doc my paycheck was larger than the maximum amount allowed for the mobile deposit of checks. So it would at least take three business days to get the check to my bank by either snail mail or with the help of another bank. In either case, the process would have taken much too long in order to pay my rent without late-fees.
I wrote my very first check in my late twenties when I moved to the U.S. By the time I had to pay rent for my first room as an undergraduate, all necessary transfers could be done through online banking in the Netherlands.
In a matter of minutes, you can transfer money from account to account, from one bank to another, without paying fees, and without worrying about uncovered checks. Yet even in those days, I still had to pick up the phone to transfer money to and from my native country Germany.
But over the years, that became possible through online banking as well. Remote banks without physical branches started to become popular, because they offered very low fees. After all, they do not have to pay the rent and employees for branches all over the country. Instead, all customer interactions are done online or over the phone. Most recently, this year, the European Union has standardized European bank account numbers, as part of establishing the Single Euro Payments Area. This makes possible convenient, affordable money transfer throughout 34 countries, speaking 26 languages, and writing in at least three different alphabets.
So why does my U.S. bank either charge me $3 to transfer money to another bank or physically prints out a check to snail-mail it to the recipient? And it’s not just foreigners who are frustrated by this system. For example, in 2012 Ron Lieber wondered in the New York Times, why it is so difficult to transfer money to family and friends.
The main explanation for this situation, that I have found, is the difficulty of creating a unified approach for the large variety and number of financial institutions in the U.S. But if the European Union has managed to do so across countries and languages, the U.S. should be able to so, too. It certainly does not lack the technical expertise.
But the perks of such systems are not confined to the E.U. and the U.S. alone. The affordable cellphone-based service called M-Pesa has become hugely popular in Kenya and has started expanding into other countries. This service has made possible money transfers between the most remote villages without requiring the physical presence of a bank.
The argument that more convenient online banking might impede on privacy rights does not convince me either. Having grown up in a village, I am quite glad if no bank employee, who might recognize my name, can “accidently” glance at the amounts and recipients of my transfers while handling my check. And even if I were to deliver my money in paper form, the bank would inevitably store this information in their Internet-connected computer systems.
In short, the current system of monetary transfers in America lags years behind the rest of the world. America might be the best place to do business for Hank Paulson, but it’s less welcoming to the common costumer.

Earlier this fall, new Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana held his first meeting with Harvard’s unrecognized social organizations such as final clubs. This annual meetinghas traditionally been a relaxed discussion about University policies.
This year, however, saw Khurana, accompanied by Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde, seemingly taking a harder line toward these organizations—specifically with regard to how these groups’ values align with the greater Harvard community. This is a welcome change and is hopefully indicative of a shift in how the administration engages with these groups.
In the past year, the University has started to take a stronger stance toward student livelihood and safety. Examples of this shift include the massive restructuring of the University’s sexual assault policy, and Khurana’s efforts to reach out to students since assuming the deanship.
These are certainly steps in the right direction, and administrators are properly taking the reins in shaping this aspect of Harvard culture. However, successful and long-term improvements cannot be brought about by the administration alone.
College administrators have given undergraduates a greater voice in shaping policy at Harvard, especially with regard to sexual assault. Students should continue to make their voices heard, not only to the faculty but also to their peers. Cultural change means a holistic change, and students must also take an initiative in fostering equality and safety.
Student groups such as Our Harvard Can Do Better have already demonstrated their leadership in encouraging a safe and egalitarian culture on campus. Unrecognized social clubs are also important players in Harvard’s social landscape, regardless of their official relationship with the university. These organizations share the responsibility of making Harvard a better place.
Concern regarding unrecognized clubs is not a new phenomenon. In the past, students have indicated concern about the lack of diversity in finals clubs, as well as these clubs’ roles in perpetuating violence against students. Regardless of whether these complaints are valid, it seems clear that there is an image problem. These clubs should take an active stance in ensuring that their values—regarding socioeconomic diversity, racial diversity, and gender and sexuality—are respectful and in line with the standard we expect of Harvard students.
Hopefully, Khurana and other administrators will continue to work with unrecognized social groups, and will continue to hold these groups responsible for the impact they have on their fellow Harvard students.
Unrecognized social organizations can be leaders on campus. It is time for these clubs to truly take on this role.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I walk into the Barker Center, the home of the humanities on our campus, I feel excited about the challenges and opportunities that await me. Whether a discussion about the merit of comic books as literature or a heated debate on the slave trade ensues, I find myself forced to think about my values, my opinions, and the construction of my world. Not surprisingly, I frequently leave the building with a pounding headache and a small smile on my face. The two go hand-in-hand: The days that the content makes my head hurt the most are also the days that I most appreciate what I study.
I hope that all of my fellow students also feel challenged by their courses but still find happiness in those moments when the information or question at hand may be too difficult to handle (at least temporarily). What I do not want and what I find limiting, however, is competing over which field of study is the hardest or most valuable.
Unfortunately, I have been taken all too often by our predisposition to declare our own or others’ interests the most difficult or worthwhile. As a prospective humanities concentrator, I become frustrated when I hear someone say, “Anybody can read books and talk in class.” I also struggle to understand the reason for the following retort a humanities’ concentrator might make: “How does your concentration challenge you to think about the people around you and your own values?” It’s bad enough that these tensions exist among students, but they are also made more difficult when they exist among professors. It is hard to believe that in a community committed to learning and the sharing of ideas, dismissing other forms of thinking, intentionally or not, helps anyone.
In coming up with this article, I could not help but think about the definition of a Renaissance Person. According to Merriam Webster Dictionary, a Renaissance Person is “one who is interested in and knows a lot about many things.” The goal of a liberal arts education, in my mind, is to make each of us a Renaissance Person of our own kind. Maybe some of us will think about how to solve human problems with machines, while others will discover how to provide needed medicines using governmental and economic structures.  The beauty of Harvard is that each of us can do it in our own way.
“The History of American Democracy,” a class I am taking this semester, embodies the excitement and importance of recognizing how the disciplines interact to shape the world. Taught at the Business School by a professor with a Ph.D. in American History and an M.A. in Economics, the course requires us to look at a cross-section of the influences that have shaped our country. We have read economic theory, discussed political philosophy, looked at the course of past events, and read primary source historical documents. Intense debates develop about whether the answers to the questions we are examining lie in economic theory or in the influence of public opinion. Our professor frequently suggests, in response to our sometimes one mindedness, that American Democracy is an organism that rights itself with the help of many forces when it needs to.
As we move forward in a world that becomes more complex each day, we must utilize the different disciplines together like my professor does in order to fully understand and solve our world’s problems. If and when we take on something as big as poverty, for example, a life scientist will not be able to solve it on his or her own, nor will an engineer, a humanist, a political scientist, or an economist. The world’s varied and intertwined social and economic structures will require all of them to work in conjunction to do so.
When we look at smaller problems on our own campus, the same reality exists. Instead of debating the merits of different types of knowledge and questioning the thinking of other learners, let’s embrace these different viewpoints. Ironically, many of my friends and I agree that the people we learn the most from are our fellow students outside of the classroom. Furthermore, I have heard many people say that the variety of experiences, backgrounds, political beliefs, and personalities that exist among us is the core and the beauty of our Harvard community. I think we should include the variety of intellectual pursuits in that list.
The first step to accomplishing this acceptance would be for all of us to recognize that no one’s concentration is necessarily better, harder, or more valuable than anyone else’s and to speak positively about all of them. I believe that what we learn individually first and then share and learn collectively will allow for own growth and the greatest improvement of our community and the world. Let’s appreciate each other’s respective strengths and not work in isolation. Let’s work, in the words of Harvard President Drew Faust, toward “One Harvard.”

Ah, the wonders of the vending machine—enabling students to stay indoors for weeks on end since they were first invented in the 1880s. Don’t wait for the next blizzard to scope out supply lines. FM will guide you through some of the best vending machines at Harvard, so you can always be prepared.
Lamont Café
The French Laundry of vending machines: Health conscious. Locally sourced. Attracts yuppies. Items include: greek yogurt, nut clusters, coconut water, and chips made from various exotic grains. Can you say quinoa? Kween-wa.
Malkin Athletic Center
Plenty of electrolytes can be found on the first floor of the MAC. Also available: make-your-own Starkist tuna salad kits. Great for a post-workout treat, or maybe you just really like tuna salad. No judgement here. Protein up!
Harvard Grad School of Design
The vending machine for the everyday computer nerd. Ethernet cables, computer locks, and SD cards available 24 hours a day for the Harvard grad design student. You never know when you’ll need a flash drive.
i-Lab
In the name of encouraging entrepreneurship and innovation, Harvard i-Lab’s vending machine allows you to craft your own soda, choosing from fine flavors such as ginger ale, grape, and lemon-lime. You’ll feel like a carbonation brewmaster.
Loeb Theater Backstage
The best kept retro secret of vending machines, this theater gem has old-fashioned sweets you’ll find nowhere else, including Whatchamacallit candy bars, Hot Tamales, and Milk Duds. True to its roots, here’s one machine that will take none of your Crimson Cash—quarters only.
Currier
Basically the same as CVS. Toiletry items packed in cute little single use containers—deodorant, chargers, band-aids, and the like—make Quadlings’ lives a little less terrible. Wonder why you haven’t seen your Currier friend in two months? She’s been living off the machine.
Weld Basement
Basically the same as CVS, but this time the smaller CVS that never has what you need, but is good if you’re looking for toothpaste, or more likely, girl’s XS 100 percent cotton t-shirts (in both black and white). Supplies everything a freshman needs to prepare for that first walk of shame, and everything a freshman needs to avoid the true walk of shame: the 3 a.m. CVS run for Kraft Mac n’ Cheese.
The Crimson
Ah, ye olde Crimson. This trusty gal (guy?) has been fueling late night news sessions for years uncountable. ¡Salud!

9:30 a.m.: Wake up for your 10 a.m. Give up on your 10 a.m. Last night’s Thirsty Thursday debauchery certainly doesn’t come for free. Your parents, eyes bright, peek into your miniscule Holworthy double. Lie to your parents, saying you received an email that your [insert class that would never be cancelled] lecture was postponed. Roll back into bed, sinking into the deepest parts of slumber you can only enjoy during truancy.
12:05 p.m.: Alright, now that the hour no longer ends in a.m., it’s about time you make some effort (or at least pretend to). Hustle the ‘rents over to your Ec 10 class and assure them that yes, it’s fine if you’re seven minutes late. Awkwardly take a seat in the back of the room and shoot your dad threatening looks every time he makes an attempt to correct your TF.
1:03 p.m.: You and your parents surf the waves of students leaving Ec 10. The line to Annenberg lunch is longer than the line at Tasty Burger at 3 a.m. Spot that  kid from your Expos class whose name  you always forget (David? Davin? Flavius?). Treat your parents to tomato basil ravioli soup; beg them for an increase in your food budget.
2:20 p.m.: Stomachs full, but definitively not satisfied, begin moving your parents out of Annenberg. On the way out, bump into your fumbling hook-up from two weekends ago, the one who fell asleep midway through the experience. Physically cringe as your parents make conversation with his/hers. When they ask how you know each other, mumble something incoherent about a study group.
2:50 p.m.: Finally acquiesce to your parents’ pleas for a tour of the Yard. Gesture broadly at various freshman dorms. To be honest, you still don’t really know the name of half of these buildings. “What’s that one behind John Harvard called?,” mom asks.  You don’t know, but probably should, considering you puked on its steps last week. At the mention of Johnny H, you remember to swat your folks’ hands away from his foot.
4:00 p.m.: Now your parents want to see Widener Library. Harmless enough, you think. You think wrong. While leading them down into the Stacks, freeze when you hear what can’t possibly be, but what necessarily must be, moans. They hear it, too. You see your mother get that glint in her eye. You are suddenly aware of your solid third-wheel status. Leave hurriedly, shouting excuses for your sudden absence as you break into a sprint. Go grab a coffee from ABP as your parents get it on. Allow yourself to shed a tear about the fact that they are closer to completing Harvard’s Three Things than you are.
5:30 p.m.: Upon reuniting with your parents, you run into a group of friends outside of the library. You introduce them to your parents and try to draw attention away from that one guy who’s always day drunk.
6:30 p.m.: This is why your parents are really here: to indulge your disgusting gluttony, to take you out to endless dinners. Grafton Street. Legal Sea Foods. Russell House Tavern. The Red House. You want it all. And you want it now. This is, after all, your only chance at human food for the entire semester.
9:30 p.m.: End dinner only when you legitimately fear you won’t be able to fit into that trendy, in-with-the-teens number you (AKA your parents) just bought for tonight. Watch in satisfaction as your parents foot the bill.
9:45 p.m.: As the numbers on the clock near the double digits, you realize it is nearing your favorite time of day: Turn-up-o’clock. The texts finally start rolling through. Mainly, “What are you up to tonight?” and “Let’s get your parents fucked up.”
10:00 p.m.: In quintessential freshman style, hit up three pre-games, each of which is either overlit and deserted or approximately 110 degrees and sticky with spilled Natty Light. Regardless, they all get shut down within 15 minutes of your arrival. Fight or flight kicks in, and there’s no way in hell you’re fighting the angry proctor who’s threatening to take pics of your ID. Peace out, strobe-light-lit Straus!
11:45 p.m.: Now that all those Fireball shots have made you borderline immobile, you can head to your real destination: a [insert club/varsity sport] banger in Mather. You hear through the grapevine that a friend said her friend’s roommate’s brother’s friend is throwing a “Social Contracts and Sexual Contacts” party.
12:30 a.m.: It’s the a.m. once again, and you wonder how you’ve gone this long without uploading a single drunk Snapchat to your story. You easily remedy this problem. Your BFF watches a snap of you and the ‘rents forming a flip cup superteam and replies with “COME 2 SPEE!!!” At this point, you’re in a more than suggestible mood, so you get the crew back on the road.
1:10 a.m.: A 3-minute walk has stretched into a 40-minute trek, your parents having been warmed by the heartiness that is Rubinoff. Finally, you arrive at the mecca of all freshman girls: the door of the Spee. Predictably, your father gets turned down—gotta keep that 7:1 ratio, you know. Apologetically send him to Tasty Burger with the rest of your guy friends.
1:30: a.m. You’re in, and your mother’s shimmy has still got it. Like flies, final club bros swarm from left and right. It’s your job to swat them away. You are the heroine in this video game, and if you choose to accept and successfully complete the mission, your prize is your parents’ saved marriage. The catch is you are level 12 faded and your XP is dropping at a frightening pace.
2:45 a.m.: That’s it, you’ve had enough of your mom dancing on tables and you absolutely never want to see her drop it that low ever again. In an attempt to escape the suffocating heat and preponderance of drunken females, you stumble back to the entrance into the clear, crisp night.
3:15 a.m.: Ne’er was there a soul returning from the Spee at 3:15 who was not blackout, and you are not one to fight science. Despite having eaten for a small family at dinner time, you tear through all food in sight, being the ravenous drunk that you are. You climb, or fall, rather, into bed fully dressed and, before your head hits the pillow, your final waking thoughts are about where in the world your parents may be. You’re also missing your coat, ID, and wallet, but you won’t notice that until tomorrow morning.
Saturday, Nov. 8:
11:10 a.m.: You awake to the sound of a phone call coming through. Surprise, it’s UHS! (Maybe you should add them to your favorites already?) In a shocking turn of events, it’s not that one irresponsible friend. It’s your parents. Shamefully pick them up from the Mt. Auburn office. Looks like Daddy did one too many keg stands last night.
12:30 p.m.: Pop some Advil and don those shades, because it’s time for drunk brunch. Feast upon Veritaffles and wallow in last night’s poor decisions. You only have a vague sense of what went down after 11:00 p.m., but, luckily, you have your Snapchat story to fill in the blanks. After watching, you sort of wish those blanks hadn’t been filled.
3:15 p.m.: Your parents realize they can’t hang. They get in the taxi for their flight back home, leaving you to work on your p-set alone. Just another weekend. Just another memory for the family scrapbooks.

It’s Halloweekend, folks, and fuck if I’m paying for my own alcohol. Also, I spent my work-study money on lingerie, because this Halloween, I’m going as Molly Bloom. Molly Bloom, a character in James Joyce’s “Ulysses,” is a fierce bitch, and the novel ends on her “yes” of orgasmic affirmation. She is an artist and a badass motherfucker who eats sausages for breakfast. She is also way cooler than Penelope, the dutiful let’s-weave-our-feelings character from the Odyssey on whom she is based, and she spends the novel’s last chapter in bed masturbating because she gives zero fucks about your opinion on her sexuality. Also, one time this dude I liked told me I was too Molly—vulgar and excessive feelings—for him to want to date me. And this is exactly why Molly Bloom makes the perfect Halloween costume: what’s spoOoOokier than female appetite?
Gaetano D’Aquino Pinot Grigio
Grifone Sangiovese
(Free; pregame)
Like former lovers, past bottles of wine pop up tonight with alarming frequency. My old flame Gaetano d’Aquino makes an appearance at the pregame. He’s here with Grifone Sangiovese, who my friends later reassure me is a bitch far more basic than I. (No one will feel better as a result of this interaction, but the attendant insecurity will motivate us all to buy plenty of mascara, so score one for capitalism.) I take a shot of peppermint Schnapps, which tastes like toothpaste.
“Who’s your Blazes Boylan?” asks the pregame host, one of the people in my freshman “Hamlet and Ulysses” seminar I did not sleep with. That, I tell him, is the question of the evening. There is no bottle opener at the pregame, so someone tries to lob off the tops of the wine to unfortunate effect: The corks are still stuck in the necks of the bottles, but decapitated. The best wine, I tell myself by way of consolation, is the wine untasted.
Franzia Crisp White
Franzia Chillable Red
(Free; party)
Oh Franzia Crisp White, oh Chillable Red, we meet again. You have followed me here even though I have indicated no interest in you, just like the dude who keeps dancing up on me as though he’s going to get pussy for disregarding my personal space. My friend, seeing the unsolicited attention and stepping in as Active Bystander Champion, says, “We’ll make you a gay sandwich!” He and my other friend (in sparkles) groove into formation; I am the queer lettuce. Undeterred by the shield of fabulous, Aggressive Dude grabs my waist.
Me: I don’t know what you think you’re doing, but it is not okay.
Dude: What’s your Halloween costume?
Me: I am MOLLY BLOOM. [Storm away in feminist fury to the other side of the dance floor.]
Consent—it’s like oxygen: If you think you don’t need it, you’re a douchebag. Luckily, at this point Aggressive Dude leaves and that song everyone likes comes on, and I’m jumping around in ecstasy with my friends, and everyone I love, and my roommate. Well fuck me against a wall in Gibraltar—this shit is beautiful.
Franzia Fruity Sangria
(Free; party)
Franzia is pulling no punches with the targeted advertising: I have half a red Solo cup of this stuff, and I have never felt fruitier. Also, literally everyone I have ever had a crush on is at this Halloween party, in a hot clusterfuck of intoxication, pastiche, and feelings. I embarrass myself utterly with some inept flirting (today’s four dollar wine is brought to you by the letter “Personal Space”—to be respected by all genders!) and decide it is better for everyone if I head out. I exchange greetings with the guy I always pass on the way home, who is about to go to sleep on the sidewalk. Memory of Aggressive Dude sharp on my brain, I flinch in expectation of words about my exposed flesh, my cleavage, or belly. But our greeting is friendly as always: “It’s getting cold out,” he says, and I say, “It’s getting cold out.” And then I think it’s stupid if this is going to be the limits of my feminism, if all I want is the right to say “yes” to sex and my great-grandmother’s ripped fur and my $80 of lingerie, when power is everywhere and fucking complicated, and the world is a big, unjust, loaded “maybe.” The cold presses my nipples against the stupid fabric of my bustier, and it is November already.

I study history and literature, that most refined, elegant, and humble combination of subjects. But it seems that is not enough for the despotic tyrants of Harvard’s Program in General Education. “You must be well-rounded,” they say. “You must study math to remind yourself of how shitty your math has become, and you must study science to remind yourself of how shitty your science has become, and you must stop reading books—everyone thinks you’re a huge nerd.”
Because of that mindset, I have spent this semester learning about the Science of the Physical Universe, also known as SPU. I have learned about rocks, stars, rock stars, convection cycles, convection ovens, and bangs bigger than my own. I have watched a water bottle bubbling with dry ice erupt like Vesuvius, frothing furiously and shattering plastic and making that girl who sits behind me shriek in an embarrassing way. I have regarded the wonders of the cosmos, coming to terms with humanity’s insignificance by doing a lab that saw me measure and record the most inaccurate of distances and angles between the Science Center and Memorial Church.
I have learned what it means to be a speck on the spectrum of the universe, a small blot on colossal systems that orbit and collide.
I took a quiz, an ode to the days when I learned about density, mass, and volume between spelling practice time and dawning-sexual-awareness time. I took a midterm, which I actually don’t have any complaints about, because it was a pleasant experience. The fun ended there, however.
I took another quiz on Friday, Oct. 31. The first Senior Bar was on Thursday, Oct. 30. That was the day before the quiz that I took on Friday, Oct. 31, and that fact gripped my powerless psyche as I tried to understand what “coarse” and “fine” meant when talking about minerals. Are they asking about the crystals? Or about how touching them feels?
I don’t hate Senior Bar because it painfully reminds me that I don’t have many friends. I don’t mind that I don’t know much of the senior class, or that the people I do know have lost—actively, aggressively, deservedly, lost—my respect by “pushing back” and “piggybacking” and “playing devil’s advocate” during section.
No; I hate Senior Bar because I couldn’t go to the first one because I was studying for a quiz that was as disconnected from my life as the people who thought it would be okay to ask me to pay for my own drinks at Senior Bar. It wouldn’t be too bad if the drinks were free, actually.
Yeah, I’d go then.

“Hello, love,” Amanda Palmer says to me in a playful, mildly British accent. She’s on the road and her cellphone signal is crackly. “We have to keep driving, so I might lose you for a bit and call back,” Palmer explains, her voice now back to its original Lexington, Mass. self. We talk, in on-and-off bursts, for about an hour.
The artist also known as Amanda Fucking Palmer is one-half of the Brechtian punk cabaret duo The Dresden Dolls, Evelyn Evelyn, and the lead singer and songwriter of Amanda Palmer and the Grand Theft Orchestra. Her middle stage name, “Fucking,” was given to her by singer-songwriter Ben Folds. “He knew someone who didn’t like me, and the person would refer to me as ‘Amanda fucking Palmer,’” she says.
As her polarized “middle name” suggests, Palmer is absolutely loved by many—yet loathed by some. The media has called her everything from an icon to an egotist. Fortunately, labels don’t mean that much to her. She emphasizes that her upcoming book, “The Art of Asking, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Let People Help,” is not concerned with “role-playing.” It instead expands on her 2012 TED talk, “The Art of Asking.”
“When I was writing the book, I thought about the theme very deeply,” she says. “Is asking itself an art that you can learn? What are the rules? What are the graces that go into asking? What really makes someone an Olympic-level asker when other people lag at it?”
Bride's Dress Revisited 
Both the book and TED talk trace Palmer’s philosophy of asking back to her days as a street performer in Harvard Square. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, Palmer busked in the Square as “The Eight Foot Bride.” Face painted and body dressed completely in white, a doll-ified Palmer would give flowers to passerby, sometimes having “the most profound encounters with people, especially lonely people who looked like they hadn’t talked to anyone in weeks,” she recounts in her viral TED talk.
The encounters that weren’t profound were still…something. Palmer recalls one of her favorite moments that she wound up cutting from the book. A “very nice-looking woman in her forties” watched Palmer busking for a long time. After some calculating eye contact, the woman approached the “Bride.”
“She came up to me, and said that she felt what I did was absolutely beautiful and heartwarming and artistic and important,” Palmer says. “And she thought that I brought the power of white people to Cambridge.” Palmer chuckles incredulously and adds, “I just kept thinking, what do I say to this person? I smiled and nodded. I didn’t try and argue. I, like my art, let her believe what she wanted to.”
The Square’s personalities have changed, but perhaps not as markedly as its appearance. Palmer frequented the Square’s Pit in the ’90s, when she was “trying to be punk rock and awesome.” Even then, people would comment on the area’s constant renovations. According to Palmer, the ’90s were “a golden age, full of record stores and clothing shops.”
“There’s barely a trace of that left,” she sighs. “The things that keep me hanging on: the Brattle, Pamplona, Grolier Poetry Book Shop, and Algiers—the last standing vestiges of that Harvard Square.” She says that, as a former kid of suburbia, she worries about the teenagers who are currently in her place. “They go on the T, and where do they go? To Newbury Street? I worry! Maybe they’re only hanging out on the Internet, which is depressing enough.”
That being said, the Internet has been one of Palmer’s major artistic platforms. Seeking out the tight-knit community she had in Boston and New York, Palmer began blogging when she started touring with her band in 2001. “The idea that I could pour my soul out in songs and through my blog, it’s completely liberating,” she mentions. “I can just talk to people and I don’t need an intermediary or a middleman.”
Palmer’s Punk-Love Perspective
The lack of a buffer between performer and audience in Palmer’s work adds a particularly personal touch to every encounter, be it blogged or performed onstage. While on tour, Palmer would often couchsurf at fans’ homes. She funded an entire album through Kickstarter donations.
Palmer’s proclivity for openness, however, places her in a vulnerable position. “I’ve found that out the hard way,” she notes. “Especially as a woman, some people will respect you for doing that and some people will detest you. There were many times when I wanted to take back what I said and hide in a cave. But once you put yourself out there, it’s no longer an option to retreat.”
Personal creeds of that nature take years to master. Looking back on her time at Wesleyan University, Palmer remembers college as a “frustrating and confusing and irritating” environment. A stifling creative block marked her four years in undergraduate study. “My dirty secret is that...I was on Zoloft and didn’t write a single song,” she says. “I held my peace, closed my eyes, tried to do well, and tried to get the fuck out of there. I just didn’t have good tools to negotiate a new environment.”
She adds, “If you’re at a place like Harvard, the rate is particularly high to do 9 million things at once. If you’re highly social and really good at multitasking, you’ll probably flourish.” From Palmer’s perspective, it’s better to “take a year off, get a shitty job, get an apartment, get a fresh perspective, and go back. The world will not end.”
With a multi-city book tour on the way, which will kick off with a parade through Harvard Square on November 10th, Palmer is now dedicated to her friends, her family, and, of course, her fans.
She also points out that she won’t read any reviews about the book. “That’s gonna be one of the hardest things I do in my life,” she says. “Even harder than writing the book itself. There are some really controversial ideas and discussions in the book and it’s why I wrote a book and not a song. This book is no longer a conversation. It’s a statement.”
After that, she’ll have room for some down time. “I just want to go back to being Amanda Palmer,” she says with a laugh in her breath. “That’s gonna be my new job.”

Comp, a uniquely Harvard undertaking, fills a series of different roles for undergraduates seeking to join student groups on campus. It ensures that new members fit into the organization, indoctrinates them in the functions of the club, and teaches them new skills. Whether it’s over in a couple of weeks or fills up the entire semester, whether it’s a straightforward checklist or a highly challenging competition, comping is an investment of time, energy, and effort to demonstrate one’s willingness and ability to actively commit.
Harvard’s social clubs were among the first to institute a comp-like process at the College. In fact, the selective nature of campus extracurriculars began with the very first club at Harvard. Known as The Institute of 1770, this speaking-club-slash-social-fraternity was founded with the intention of improving its members’ oratory skills. Membership was competitive from the start. Originally open only to seniors, the semi-secret Institute later allowed promising juniors—and, occasionally, even exceptional underclassmen—to join.
One of the next organizations to hand-select its members was the Porcellian Club. Founded around 1791 (precise date unknown), this “Gentleman’s Club” admitted members based on the principles of “Sociability, Brotherly Affection, and Generosity.” They looked specifically for those who possessed the “spirit of a true Gentleman” and could best fit in with existing members of the organization. As a result, membership often depended on one’s previous social network.
Established in 1795, the Hasty Pudding Club, a patriotic-organization-turned-social-club, centered on fellowship and the performing arts. Even at the time of its founding, membership was highly exclusive and invite-only. While initiation rites for the Pudding were always kept secret, students trying to join would often be publicly seen “hastily” running in the Yard and reciting poetry to themselves. The Institute, the Porcellian, and the Pudding were the first to formally establish competitive selection processes. Membership to each of these social clubs was largely based on connections between younger students and existing members. These organizations kept their numbers low, their selectivity high, their basis of selection a secret, and their membership exclusively male.
The Harvard Crimson (founded in 1873) was the first organization to use the word “comp” to describe the method of hosting a formal competition for new members who wished to join the organization. There is some debate about whether the etymology of the term “comp” stems from the word “competence” or “competition.” The distinction is important. A competence-based selection processes would admit all members who fulfilled all requirements, whereas a competition-based selection processes would have cuts from each round made by the existing board members. Today the term “comp” is used interchangeably for both approaches.
First known as “The Magenta,” The Crimson began by publishing issues twice a week, similarly to a literary magazine. Since Crimson editorial boards were originally limited to a set number of members, not everyone who “comped” could join the board. The comp process commenced with potential members receiving invitations to try out for the paper. In order to be elected as member of the paper, candidates had to both follow through with the comp process until completion and prove themselves capable of doing the work of a provisional editor. Students who successfully finished the comp would then join The Crimson.
“Competitions” historically drew crowds. Hundreds would show up to the initial comp meeting, with the numbers diminishing as the comp process proceeded. During this period of testing, club members could select the students who seemed most capable of doing the work while potential members could decide whether or not the club was a good fit for them. Moreover, comping fostered a learning environment in which younger members could gain knowledge passed down from their upperclassmen mentors on the board.
Although the comp process originated in the exclusive and secretive traditions of campus social clubs, it has evolved to become increasingly transparent. Today the comp for many extracurriculars focuses more on completion than competition.

A gold disco ball rotates slowly from the ceiling, turning the floor into a geometric whirlpool. Older couples fill the tables along the balconies and the stage, and twenty-somethings mill around the back of the room. A man with a small wooden chair on his head rests next to me at the bar. At 8:00p.m., the lights dim, and the jazz band onstage is replaced by a woman in a black mermaid dress. “You all excited for the show?” she booms. “Nothin’ like some naked ladies on a Tuesday night!” The elderly couples clap politely. The twentysomethings hoot. Gorelesque is about to begin.
The show is exactly what it sounds like: a horror-themed, blood-filled burlesque. Similar shows take place across the country, each one running only for a single night. This particular production is held in the Oberon, the fabulous, often glitter-filled little theater on Mass. Ave, but it’s attracted performers from all over the area.
The woman in the mermaid dress turns out to be Danielle Hect, host for the evening. Hect explains that while Gorelesque Idol is meant to be a “safe space,” it’s also a competition. She gestures to the panel of judges sitting in the VIP section. The judges will make comments after each dance, and the audience will vote on a favorite. That dancer will travel to NYC to take a spot in the national competition.
The audience is tolerant but restless as Hect explains the rules for the evening, and when the first dancer shimmies onstage, they release their pent-up anticipation in a thunderous round of applause.
The dancer, a “burn victim,” is wrapped head to toe in bloody bandages. She struts around to Halloween-themed music, unpeeling layers of gauze one at a time, until she’s standing in front of the audience in only a few artfully placed strips of fabric. Both entertaining and appalling, she seductively peels back a strip on her thigh to show us a gaping wound. She flips the blackened bandage back and forth a few times, does a few more rounds of the stage, and slinks off.
The judges love it. “I never knew scabs could be sexy,” says one. The rest quickly assent, then turn their eyes expectantly back to Hect and the rest of the dancers. They know no one’s here for the commentary.
The performances that follow are equally grim—the slow unpeeling of a woman’s skin, a two-person marionette act involving an eerily boneless doll-woman, and a sequin-covered homage to “The Blair Witch Project.” A Nightmare-Before-Christmas-esque boogeyman in head-to-toe burlap and an enormous reptilian headpiece stalk around the room; a ghoulish clown strips down to a housedress; a cannibal woman brandishes a head on a stake.
Intermission gives me the chance to catch my breath. A woman dressed as some kind of Old West saloon girl hands me a voter card, and I lean against the wall to watch the audience recover and mingle.
I must have missed the memo about dressing up because some members of the audience are wearing costumes nearly as elaborate as the dancers’. In fact, when the performers come out and start chatting with the public, they fit right in. Introductions are made. Jokes are told. Maybe it’s all the camp and glitter, but this crowd seems much more natural than the average group of strangers. I spot the guy wearing the chair again just as someone else approaches him. “I should buy you a drink,” says the stranger. “You’ve got a friggin’ chair on your head.”
Chair Guy shrugs. “I can’t help it. I was born this way.”
The second half of the night passes at lightning speed. There are performances by the host, the judges, and a crew of girls in matching black lace. There is an audience member costume contest (Chair Guy is upstaged by a skeleton with platform sneakers and killer dance moves). There’s a bit of banter, a lot of acknowledgements, and, finally, the results.
Hect calls all the dancers to the stage and hands them each a pink carnation as they line up along the thick velvet backdrop. The judges stand behind her and hand her a stack of cue cards. She delivers the standard line about closeness of votes and difficulty of decisions, the tech team starts a drum roll, and Hect announces that the winner is “Devore Darling!”
The marionette girl steps forward and the crowd cheers, but the judges look horrified. They pull Hect to the side, whisper, and push her back to the front. Face pale, Hect quiets the audience and announces that the winner is actually Femme Bones, Cannibal Woman. Bones bites the head off her carnation.
As the audience trickles outside, they seem taken aback by the biting October chill. Over the last few hours, the interior of the dark little building has become a pocket of warmth. In fact, laced with the aromatic combination of an open bar, a heavily perfumed crowd, and more than a dozen enthusiastic dancers, the air had become nearly thick enough to feel against your skin. Walking into the Oberon a few hours ago may have been a shock, but reentering the real world is now a bigger one.

Chances are if you’re reading The Harvard Crimson, you’ve never heard of Peace Love Unity Respect. The acronym is a silly combination of sounds—a feline’s pleasure with an extra letter snuck in—and the cliché it stands for wouldn’t last a minute in college classrooms. But since the ’90s, PLUR’s been a credo and a life philosophy for rave subculture. This summer it became my personal mantra. This fall I’ve decided it was Friedrich Nietzsche and Martin Heidegger’s as well.
Right now—remember time is meaningless with EDM or on uppers—warehouses across the world are filled with youngsters clad in fur and glitter. Accoutrements range from plush Pikachu backpacks to pacifiers: pragmatic aids for the jaw-clenching and texture-fetish that accompany MDMA highs. Though commercialized, Avicii-headlined festivals present the EDM scene as dance-crazed, traditional ravers do more than head-bob. Instead, most spend their nights at smaller events, striking up random conversations with people they’re never spoken to. Earnest compliments alternate with expressions of affection; hugs are traded for beaded bracelets called kandi. There’s hardly a drop of cynicism or irony to be found; it’s a world steeped in PLUR.
Four years ago, I knew this world pretty well. As the only licensed driver in my high school friend group, I’d often find myself shuttling friends to warehouses in South San Francisco—then staying to soberly watch PLUR take place from afar. I’d joke about the acronym, but I remained fascinated by the community and kinship it seemed able to create.
The mantra resurfaced this summer when I had my mid-college crisis: a phenomenon that, for most people, results in breaking up with a significant other or fleeing to study abroad. Mine took place on a beach an hour north of Boston, where I finally confronted a habit of distancing myself from others that I’d picked up at Harvard. I’d exit any conversation that seemed banal; say no and no and no again; spend a great deal of time alone reading Proust. Sure, I’d couched my insecurities in the language of psychoanalysis and valid cultural critique, but in truth I was simply detached and judgmental. It took a week of isolation in an apartment, a breakdown while listening to “Midnight Train to Georgia,” and six hours on Singing Beach reminiscing with a friend I’d driven so often in high school to realize just how closed off I’d become.
So I decided to try out PLUR. Maybe my memories of the kandi-loving kids I’d known in San Francisco could teach or reteach me something I’d lost on the East Coast.
The problem with PLUR, though, is that it’s often superficial and almost always chemically induced; a stranger may be a momentary soulmate, but that Love tends to fade as serotonin levels drop. I joked that my summer would be a three-month-long rave, but I wanted more than fleeting Unity or performative Respect.
Over the next twelve weeks, I pushed myself to uncover what authentic, day-to-day PLUR could look like. Though I never bought a binky, I thought about the acronym every day and in almost every conversation this summer. When a Berlin barista asked about my boots or a professor of anthropology interrogated me on an international flight, I’d summon the image of inflated pupils and flashing lights. I’d play a mental clip of EDM, tap into my forgotten vivacity, and speak.
Authentic PLUR, it turns out, is rather elusive, as authentic clichés tend to be. But I’ve come to believe it requires affirming the complexity of those around me, remembering that every person’s wonders and insecurities are just as fascinating and intricate as my own. Enthusiastic interest is genuine if it’s grounded in a belief that people are fundamentally interesting, simply because they are people. Practically, PLUR means pushing through skepticism to say something that may not be novel or ground-breaking, but doing so because it might stimulate a conversation. It means asking questions that leave me vulnerable in the hopes I’ll reveal a layer of nuance in the interaction. Above all, it means recasting the distance I’d coveted as narcissistic and frankly pretty boring. I don’t know about you, but I’ve realized I get pretty sick of my own mind.
This fall, I’m taking German Social Thought, and most days I find myself wondering why ascetic thinkers like Nietzsche and Heidegger are so oddly into PLUR. One of the repeated gripes these Germans have concerns our tendency to withdraw from the world. Traditional theory says we should be objective, that if we create enough distance between ourselves and external reality, we can access universal truth. They call it neo-Platonism; I prefer Freshman-Year Insecurity.
Martin Heidegger finds that ludicrous. For him, the best way to understand a hammer is to use it, just as I’ve found the best way to understand a person is to talk to her. Trying to abstractly get at what tools or people mean is ineffective, or at least, unpleasant. The surface of a first conversation not need be superficial, for it expresses something fundamental about that person—if you affirm that person and ask the right questions.
Nietzsche, too, thinks distance is the scourge of modern society, for it cripples our ability to interact fluidly with the external world. Condemning a vapid story as it’s told ensures I won’t have something natural to say when the monologue ends; but listening closely to trivial comments tends to reveal something meaningful lurking beneath them. A raver’s tendency to start a heart-to-heart with anyone is a radical “yes” to the world and to people. When, one day in section, our TF described Nietzsche’s preferred moral system as “saying yes,” I delightedly scribbled in my notes, “Was Nietzsche the origin of PLUR?”In some ways, this concordance isn’t entirely surprising. Disillusioned with past models, these thinkers sought new ways to structure social interaction just as ravers create isolated experiences to transform the way people communicate. PLUR and high social theory both stem from a belief in the significance of others; both are tinged with a deep fear of isolation.
This resemblance says something about high and low culture that I’d ignored in my disdainful, pre-PLUR days: Academic philosophy and hallucinogen-fueled acronyms often end up talking about the same sort of thing. Sure, it’s possible to fire up one’s diction, to coat PLUR in jargon and theory, but the core tenets will remain the same. Nietzsche’s abstractions led him back to basic principles of immersion: forget your detached theoretical grounding and engage fully in the present moment. My own flirtations with the ivory tower, it seems, have done the same.
One of Heidegger’s famous maxims—“essence is existence”—speaks to this point. For Heidegger, there are no discrete, isolated individuals, since we are already influencing and co-creating each other. Translating to PLUR terms I get something like this: Find Peace with the people unfolding before me. Love their surface for what it is. Understand the Unity I already have with that surface. Above all, Respect even a seemingly trivial existence for its complex essence. This is my mantra, and I’d like to think an MDMA-rolling, spandex-wearing Heidegger would approve.

“It’s a magic way to spend two years.”
Bruce B. Simpson, who is originally from Scotland, is wearing a grey, pinstriped suit. He’s representing McKinsey & Company, a management consulting firm where he’s worked since 1986. He has just given a presentation to a group of Harvard Business School students in the Charles Hotel’s ballroom, sharing photos of his family’s adventures paddling in kayaks and hiking on tundras. Throughout, he compared the whales and glaciers they have encountered to the problems consultants must solve.
If he had his way, Simpson says, he would encourage prospective consultants to consider staying longer than two years, the duration of most firms’ initial contracts; but two years is a good place to start. “I think what’s magic about those two years,” he elaborates, “is the variety of work you get to do….[and] the range of problems you get to touch.”
Off to the side is a navy blue wizard’s hat with white stars, which Simpson, a director at McKinsey’s Toronto office, wore during his talk. The hat is not a normal part of his wardrobe, but, since it’s the night before Halloween, he’s taken his cue from the dozens of audience members en route to an HBS bash, dressed in full or partial costumes.
Still, there’s a funny symbolism in his invocation of the supernatural and his choice of accessory: Consulting does seem to have an uncanny ability—a magic power, some might say—to attract a sizeable portion of Harvard students, year in and year out. It’s not just HBS alums who flock to the profession, but undergraduates, too. Whether or not the job itself is “magic,” as Simpson believes it is, few seniors know enough to surmise.
According to data collected in Harvard’s annual senior surveys and distributed by the Office of Career Services, over the course of the past four years, between 8 and 11 percent of graduating seniors became consultants right after college. The Crimson’s own senior survey data shows that of those seniors who enter the workforce directly after graduating, the percentage of consultants is far higher; for the Class of 2014, it was 14.42 percent.
And yet, less than one percent of those entering the workforce said they expected to be in consulting in 10 years. Of course, this projection could be only speculation. Few, if any, seniors are certain of the paths their careers will follow.
The consulting industry is uniquely positioned to profit from this uncertainty, offering a limited-commitment alternative in the form of two-year contracts to good thinkers eager to learn how to solve problems in business and management. The major consulting firms have a highly visible presence in on-campus recruiting and promise to expose their youngest employees to high-powered leaders across industries and around the world.
For Harvard seniors seeking intellectual stimulation and professional prestige after college, an application to these firms can make good sense. The firms can, and almost always do, serve as stepping stones, training their young hires in technical skills and business know-how that open doors to a variety of jobs in other fields. But though Harvard alumni invariably describe their tenure at these firms as educational and enriching, many find that they are no closer to certainty about their futures after two years of consulting than they were when they began.
As far as its dealings with undergraduates go, the Office of Career Services might better be described as the Office of Next Steps. The prevailing philosophy among the group’s leaders, these days, is that undergraduates will not—and should not—see the first ten years after they graduate as part of a single career trajectory, but as a series of next steps.
At the Office of Career Services on Dunster St., I start to ask OCS Director Robin E. Mount and Deborah A. Carroll, who oversees the On-Campus Interview program, if it’s fair to say that consulting is a career choice that lends itself well to the project of path-finding.
Before I can finish, Carroll interjects. “I’d be careful with the ‘career’ word,” she warns me.
Mount quickly agrees. Later in the conversation, she explains, “Our students are panicked about choosing something for ten years. ...They’re commitment-phobic.”
About 83 percent of Harvard graduates, Carroll and Mount point out, go back to graduate or professional school at some point after college. “What [that number] really means,” Mount says, “is that people are testing hypotheses. They are doing what we’re calling ‘next step experiences.’” OCS’s promotion of this outlook, she says, has helped to take some of the pressure off undergraduates as they look ahead. “Ever since we’ve buried the ‘career’ word and started talking about ‘next steps,’ you could just see this huge weight get taken off of a lot of students.”
Consulting firms specialize in marketing next steps. In the world of management consulting, and, by extension, in the landscape of on-campus recruiting, three major firms loom large. “The Big Three,” as insiders refer to them, widely considered to be the most prestigious in the industry, are McKinsey & Company, The Boston Consulting Group, and Bain & Company. All three are privately held. Their primary work consists of studying problems and suggesting solutions to the companies and organizations they count among their clients. These “cases” or “engagements” can last anywhere from several weeks to several months, and are typically executed by a pyramidal team of consultants led by one or a few senior employees. At the bottom of the pyramid, overseen by mid-level “engagement managers,” are the newest consultants, often freshly out of college, who help generate analyses and ideas for the team to present to the client. They work long hours on research and build Microsoft Excel models and PowerPoint presentations to buttress the team’s proposals. In between cases or case phases, young consultants are reassigned, joining new teams on new engagements, and so on and so forth. Even within the two years they often sign on for, then, their professional commitments are short-term. As for what comes after these two years, all three of the Big Three firms are explicit in stating that they do not expect their new employees to make a life-long commitment.
A McKinsey recruiting pamphlet, for example, assures potential applicants, “As profoundly stimulating as it is here, people do leave. We’re okay with that.” The recruitment literature of the other two major firms is similar—and comes across as similarly welcoming to those who may fear commitment. BCG’s website touts the opportunity to “[develop] new skills and experience to help you at every stage of your career—at BCG and beyond,” while Bain’s website explains that the firm’s entry level position is “a great way to set yourself up for future success—at Bain and beyond.” Taking a job at one of these firms, they imply, is just as much about the firm as it is about the “beyond.” As it is advertised, the message seems to be, “Come here to learn and grow, and if you want to leave after two years, you’ll hardly have to explain yourself.”
Many Harvard seniors become consultants precisely because of this appeal.
Michelle Wu ’07, who began work at BCG after graduating from Harvard, says she was attracted to consulting “because of the opportunities to learn and the fast-paced environment and the intellectual challenge of it.” Equally compelling, she adds, was the timeline. “The other motivation for me was that it was a two-year commitment and therefore relatively short term, [so it would] let me think about what to do afterwards.”
Consulting jobs present themselves as low in risk and high in reward. “The way that someone explained it to me that I thought was very accurate and applicable to my view of consulting was that as Harvard...students, we inherently are curious creatures and we want to open as many doors as possible for ourselves,” says Bonnie Cao ’12, “and consulting is essentially the extension of that.” Cao, who worked at McKinsey, adds, “If you’re not positive what you want to do after college, consulting is always the safer route….It never closes any doors, it only opens more.”
Connie Lee ’12 says she came to Harvard with a vague idea of becoming a lawyer. “I was so indecisive in college and not sure about where I wanted to go,” Lee says. She interned at BCG the summer after her junior year and decided to return to the firm after college. The level of responsibility and exposure to various industries she had there, she reasoned, would make BCG “a great launching pad” while helping her to better identify her own interests.
Others see consulting as providing the logistical means to fulfill concrete personal goals in the short-term. Andrew S. Alcorta ’11 wasn’t sure exactly what he wanted to do after graduating, but he knew he wanted to have a job that would enable him to travel while strengthening his professional credentials. “I did want to build up some skill set and some resume credibility before rolling the dice a little more,” he says. Taking time to travel after graduation, Alcorta started working at BCG in the winter of 2012. Still with BCG, he spent the past year in Istanbul.
Conversely, for some international students, taking a job at a prominent American consulting firm is a straightforward way to obtain a visa and remain in the U.S. past graduation.
The ubiquity of consulting firms in Harvard’s on-campus recruiting program can make them unexpectedly attractive even to those who are more confident about the direction of their careers. Osman Shawkat ’11 concentrated in physics at Harvard and considered going into academia. But put off by what he perceived as the slow pace of academia, he was reluctant to pursue that option. “When somebody told me you can go do a new project every couple weeks [as a consultant]...I thought, ‘That sounds amazing.’” Shawkat says. “With everybody and their brother doing either consulting or finance, the exposure is there. It seemed like a good idea, and I went for it.”
In her Baccalaureate address to the Class of 2008, University President Drew G. Faust reflected on the forces at work at Harvard College that lead so many of its graduates to seek employment in the finance and consulting sectors.
“I think you are worried,” she told the class, “because you want your lives not just to be conventionally successful, but to be meaningful, and you are not sure how those two goals fit together.” She placed some of the blame for this worry on the tone set by Harvard’s faculty and administration. “We have told you from the moment you arrived here,” Faust said, “that you will be the leaders responsible for the future, that you are the best and the brightest on whom we will all depend, that you will change the world. We have burdened you with no small expectations.”
There are neat echoes of these great expectations in consulting firms’ job descriptions. The firms guarantee that the high achievers they seek to hire will have the chance to make a real difference through their work. The McKinsey’s brochure’s selling points, for instance, include opportunities to “Change the world” and “Improve lives.”
Further, consulting firms’ preference for excellence is attractive in that it is not limited to particular areas of expertise but is open to a range of accomplishment. If figuring out how to change the world can seem daunting to liberal arts graduates who leave college with little technical training, the firms make it clear that they are prepared to train them. According to its promotional literature, McKinsey invests more than $100 million annually in “learning and training programs.”
“When considering applicants, we generally look for examples of excellence—strong academic performance, interesting work experience, and meaningful leadership positions,” William B. Dechard ’01, who recruits for McKinsey at Harvard, wrote in an email. “Harvard students fare very well because they have tremendous drive, a desire to apply their critical thinking skills in a business setting, and an eagerness to seek out new opportunities and challenges.”
James C. Winter ’11, who works at the mid-size strategy consulting firm OC&C, called me from a train in rural England; he’s currently working at the firm’s London office and was returning from a weekend trip. When the connection failed, Winter followed up with an email. “The liberal arts education can feel like it limits your options,” he wrote, “but consulting does give you license to concentrate in what you want but still enter the business world seamlessly after graduation.”
A history concentrator with a secondary in ethnic studies, Gary D.J. Gerbrandt ’14, who now works at Bain in Canada, went through on-campus recruiting last fall along with many of his friends from various fields of study. He says he thinks consulting firms “look for people who have a diversity of interests and a diversity of backgrounds.”
This willingness to hire students of all academic interests is made possible by consulting firms’ extensive training and mentorship programs. “You see a lot of our students, because of the liberal arts background, feeling that if you want to work in business, you need some business training,” Mount says. Consulting, an industry that has maintained large budgets for training as other sectors have cut back, is a tempting track for those who want the chance to change the world.
“It’s like finishing school,” says Mount. “It’s advancing your learning.”
Joseph M. Kerns ’08, a social studies concentrator, chose to work at McKinsey after realizing that his main goal in a first job was developing leadership and business skills. Kerns says that inexperience is almost expected of entry-level consultants. In addition to formal training, pre-MBA-level consultants learn a great deal from hands-on experience. Most describe a steep learning curve. From business etiquette to methods of numerical analysis and presentation formatting, Harvard College typically teaches few of the skills that are central to the daily lives of consultants.
“You get better over time,” Kerns asserts. “The cool thing is that McKinsey...has a model of hiring smart, talented people who don’t necessarily know anything when they start and everyone knows that’s how it goes.”
Beyond the excitement of learning new skills and the promise of solving problems on a global scale, some find the reality of arduous schedules overwhelming, and the lackluster client lists disappointing.
Most new consultants are aware of the long and unpredictable hours that the work entails, but say it can be difficult to fully grasp what this means until they’ve experienced their first string of fourteen-hour days. “It’s such an obvious thing,” says Rebecca A. Zofnass ’09, who worked at Bain for three years after graduating from Harvard, “but you just don’t really think about it.”
James T. Kloppenberg, a member of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Standing Committee on Public Service and a history professor, says he thinks it’s strange that consulting has come to be perceived as a glamorous job. “They’re extremely challenging jobs,” he counters.
Kloppenberg’s son took a job at McKinsey when he graduated from Amherst College, and while he “found the work interesting,” Kloppenberg reports, he described the conditions as “abominable.”
“There is that underside to it that that these are extremely talented people who are being exploited for other people’s benefit,” Kloppenberg notes.
Kloppenberg recognizes that some of the excitement comes from the high level of demand. “Even though you’re the lower person on the totem pole,” he says, “you’re dealing with people who are very well qualified, and very hard-driving, and very talented, and so there’s a kind of buzz that goes along with that.”
Because cases are assigned to consultants by more senior employees, recent hires can’t predict exactly what they’ll be working on as they begin projects.
When Ben L. Brinkopf ’11 started at BCG’s Dallas office after college, his first assignment was to a team of consultants working with “a very small carpet-cleaning company that literally manufactured machines that you would rent at the grocery store.” He was most interested in learning about the airline industry and had expected to travel; surely, he remembers thinking, he had been misinformed. A carpet-cleaner, he jokes, “is the most un-sexy product you will find. And I thought at that moment that…[going into consulting] was a complete mistake.” The project lasted for several months.
The size of the carpet-cleaning company, however, proved beneficial, enabling Brinkopf to take on a greater degree of responsibility than he says is typical for a first case. “Often you work your way up in consulting so that after you’ve mastered the fundamentals, then you take on more parts of the project and start interfacing with clients even more,” Brinkopf says. “But in my very first project, since it was such a small company, it was very easy for us to interact with senior members of the leadership team.”
Ultimately, Brinkopf says, the case helped him realize that his future clients’ industries or products would be far less important to his experience as a consultant than the team he was working with. He cites a larger tenet of management consulting: “At BCG we like to say, even though there may be a hierarchy of positions, there’s no hierarchy of quality of ideas.”
More often than not, though, new consultants have a far less influential position within their teams than they expect they will. Though, in retrospect, Brinkopf sees his first case as unusually hands-on, at the time he was somewhat disappointed with the role he was expected to play. “I came out [of Harvard] with the idea that in my first month I’d be giving the pitch deck to the CEO telling him or her what the company needed to change and how they could do it,” Brinkopf recalls. “Quite honestly, I was mistaken.”
Proximity to power does not always amount to influence. Alex J. Lee ’06 has worked at Novantas, a small consulting firm in New York City, since he graduated from Harvard eight years ago. “Let’s be honest,” he says. “If you’re a 24-year-old kid with 55-year-old CEOs, they’re not going to be sitting there listening to you,” Lee says. “It’s a sexy idea,” he concedes, though he’s quick to add it rarely happens that way.
There are, to be sure, tangible benefits to working at a “brand name” firm. Bigger firms encourage their employees to attend business school and even pay for them to do so if they agree to come back to the firm for several years of work afterward. They also help facilitate externships everywhere from the United Nations to tech companies. And even beyond the material support mechanisms, names like McKinsey, Bain, and BCG never hurt on an application.
While interviewees uniformly praised prestigious consulting firms’ treatment of their employees, most also recognized that the field of consulting itself is simply not for everyone. It rarely works, they say, for those who have already identified a job they would rather be doing elsewhere.
About a year and a half into her stint at BCG in Boston, Michelle Wu had to take a leave of absence from the job in order to return home to Chicago and take care of her mother, who was ill. “The company had very generously offered to let me think about changing offices,” she says, but ultimately she realized that the time commitment of working as a full time consultant, even if she were to be based in Chicago, would be too great a burden.
Wu says she hadn’t considered the constant travel a downside when she started as a consultant. Instead, she saw it as a perk. But after moving home to become her sister’s legal guardian, she recognized that she “wasn’t going to be able to travel on a moment’s notice,” she explains. “The lifestyle wasn’t going to be able to work for me.”
Forced to take time off from consulting, Wu found that she did not want to go back. “It was very interesting to go from topic to topic and become really skilled and learn a lot about what you were consulting the company on,” Wu says, “but then oftentimes the case would end right after you had developed the solution, and you wouldn’t get to see what happened.”
She wanted to see the results. “I really realized that I enjoyed having a direct impact in making people’s lives better, and with consulting you’re not only in the business world, for the most part...but you’re one level removed from the work that is going on,” Wu says.
Using the skills she had gained at BCG, Wu opened a tea house in Chicago and began to consider attending law school. She was accepted at HLS, and looked to her legal studies as a means of further involvement with neighborhood small business and city government. Today, after graduating from HLS in 2012, she serves as a Boston City Councilor At-Large.
Before her two-year contract at McKinsey’s Stamford, Conn. office was up, Bonnie Cao spoke to a mentor at the firm about her interest in the entertainment sector. She wanted to know if there might be further opportunities to engage in entertainment consulting at McKinsey. “He was very blunt with me,” she recalls, “and I appreciated it.” Cao’s mentor told her that the best way to spend the majority of her time in the entertainment industry was to look for a job in the entertainment industry. He encouraged her to get started right away.
Though it’s rare to leave before one’s contract has expired, as Cao did, she credits McKinsey’s training sessions on personal growth and the mentorship she received there with helping her find a job she loves.
Within weeks of conversing with her mentor, Cao moved across the country to begin working for Sony Pictures in Los Angeles. She considers her experience to be far from the norm. “When I left,” she explains, “I actually got a ton of emails from my McKinsey colleagues, being like, ‘Let’s chat, I want to figure out how you got to this point.’” The whole experience has underscored a point for Cao: “The reason that we get into consulting is that we’re not sure.”
Osman Shawkat, the physics concentrator who chose consulting over academia, is glad he did, though he ultimately realized that his interests lay elsewhere. “Consulting is fun, it teaches you a lot of skills, but you’re not really making anything,” he says. “Your product is a [slide] deck,” he continues, before ceding, “I think the job we did was important, I think it was useful.” Given his abiding interest in engineering, Shawkat has concluded that, for him, slideshows are not enough to hold his interest: “I just need to make something a little more tangible.”
Shawkat says he thinks the culture of great expectations at Harvard can lead the College’s young alumni to place too much emphasis on leadership, causing them to ignore other enriching professional opportunities. “We always just look to be leaders, and I think there’s a risk of being just professional managers,” he says. “We do it at the expense of actually getting into a field, understanding it and being able to do it top to bottom.”
When the fast clip and inconsistent schedule become exhausting—or consultants decide they want to learn more, elsewhere—the idea that consulting “opens doors” does seem to bear out. Joe Kerns founded a startup with a colleague from McKinsey, and Connie Lee works at a startup “founded by a former BCG-er.” Ben Brinkopf is at Harvard Business School. Becky Zofnass graduated from HBS and is now an HBS leadership fellow at Teach for America. Other former consultants end up in more strictly financial positions in private equity and investment banking.
“I used to think [consulting] was not the right step to take,” Kloppenberg says. “But looking at the people I know who’ve done it, I’m inclined to say, if you’re doing it for the right reason, it can be a very good experience.”
It’s a good experience, Kloppenberg says, if “you want to learn about the world outside the university, and because you realize that this is a way to explore a lot of different worlds of work in a two-year period. I think accumulating a range of experience after college is a very useful thing to do. Traveling is a nice way to do that. Teaching English in another country is a nice way to do that. But working for a consulting firm...is another way to do that. ...Those opportunities can open doors, and open doors culturally, socially, in a lot of ways other than simply opening the door to the next promotion.”
Still, consulting is only one of many possible post-graduate experiences that involve novelty, networking, skill-building, and valuable mentorship.
Gene A. Corbin, assistant dean of student life for public service, spends a great deal of time promoting entry into what he calls the “public interest sector.” Corbin is by no means “anti-consulting,” he says, but he’s keen to point out that consulting may not be as uniquely beneficial as undergraduates perceive it to be.
“The notion that if you go into the public interest sector [you] won’t get mentorship and won’t get skill development, and then if you go into consulting, you’ll get all this mentorship, all this skill development that will somehow be transferrable to what you really want to do,” Corbin says, “strikes me as curious.”
The question of “what you really want to do,” Corbin notes, can remain unanswered. “Something that students don’t realize,” he says, “is that you live with that question the rest of your life.”
Often, when it comes to choosing next steps, there is no magic wand.
Since leaving consulting, his first job out of college, Osman Shawkat has done what OCS would call “testing hypotheses,” working at a bike shop and in research and development for varying lengths of time. When I ask him if he has a better sense, now, of his ideal career path, Shawkat pauses, reflects, and then answers: “I think so.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The historically complex relationship between Russia and China will either strain or strengthen in coming years as the two contend for power in Eurasia, said Vitaly Kozyrev, a visiting scholar at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies, at a lecture Wednesday afternoon.
“Both sides recognized [in the late 17th century], as they recognize now, that they have a lot in common,” said Mark C. Elliott, History professor and director of the Fairbank Center for Chinese Study, who moderated the event. “There is a lot to gain by exploiting those areas of common interest, whether economic or political—but they both are rivals, and they’re always in danger of tensions escalating.”
Speaking to about 20 attendees in the CGIS Belfer Case Study Room, Kozyrev discussed the feasibility of Russian president Vladimir Putin’s “Eurasian dream”—his vision of a strong sphere of influence in Central Asia and beyond—given China’s increasingly dominant presence in the region.
“[The ‘dream’] is related to the perception of Russia as a Euro-Pacific country, which is the unique role of Russia as a bridge…a civilization between Asia, with its unique set of values, and Europe,” he said.
Russia’s formation of the Eurasian Economic Union—a political and economic alliance that will include Belarus, Kazakhstan, and later Armenia—earlier this year should not be mistaken for an attempt to rebuild the old Soviet bloc, according to Kozyrev.
Instead, Russia’s present strategy sees “economic integration...as the foundation for development, peaceful competition, security, and stability,” he said.
Yet in light of the past summer’s conflict in Ukraine, Kozyrev continued, Western nations have punished Putin’s maneuvers with economic sanctions, leaving Russia politically isolated in the region. Rather than competition with China for influence, Kozyrez said he sees the potential for an alliance between the two countries.
“The Ukrainian crisis has pushed Russia into the embrace of China, so the question is to what extent Russia will try to find some kind of compromise with China,” he said.
Despite the nations’ potentially opposed visions, the two have outwardly cooperated to compete with the West, Kozyrev said. China and Russia already partnered through the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and China notably declined to condemn Russia’s crackdown in Crimea earlier this year, suggesting possibilities for future partnership between the two powers.
“You wonder whether we’re seeing the outlines of a new world order slowly coming into focus, one that bears some similarities to a world order we thought had passed away,” Elliot said.

The University’s endowment returns lagged behind those of other American colleges and universities during fiscal year 2014, according to early findings from a study of 426 institutions of higher education conducted by the National Association of College and University Business Officers and Commonfund Institute.The study found that these institutions averaged a return rate of 15.8 percent, slightly higher than the 15.4 percent returns posted by Harvard's endowment, which is the largest among U.S. institutions of higher learning and is currently valued at $36.4 billion. The University’s endowment, which is managed by Harvard Management Company, also returned a lower rate than the 16.8 percent average for institutions with assets in excess of $1 billion, according to the early study from NACUBO.“With only a few exceptions, higher relative performance by the largest endowments is in keeping with the findings of our Studies over more than a decade,” said Commonfund Institute executive director John S. Griswold in a press release. “The greater diversification practiced by the largest endowments and their emphasis on a variety of sources of return, both public and private, tends to result in higher long-term investment performance.” The report noted that colleges and universities are continuing the trend of increasing allocations to alternative investment strategies, such as private equity and private capital, with 65 percent of institutions with assets of $1 billion or more employing such alternatives. Venture capital, energy and natural resources, and private equity posted the highest returns among the various asset classes, with averages of 21.2 percent, 18.4 percent, and 17.0 percent, respectively, according to the report. No asset class had a negative return in FY 2014.
Across most asset classes, Harvard experienced strong returns, although it reported weak gains in public and private equities, at .9 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively. According to the University’s most recent financial report, HMC plans to continue to increase its allocation to private equity in 2015, with a target of 18 percent.
The NACUBO report also cited the continuation of double-digit gains in four of the past five years by surveyed institutions, with endowments beginning to recover and rebuild after suffering losses in fiscal years 2008 and 2009.The data represents only a subset of the total sample of institutions that the study will evaluate. Approximately twice the 426 colleges and universities surveyed in the preliminary gathering will be taken into account for the final report, which is slated for release in January 2015.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Admissions and Financial Aid Office is in active discussions with other institutions about establishing an additional system for students to apply to college, according to Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67.
“We are always interested in new initiatives that encourage promising students to apply to college, and we have been part of the discussions about a third way that students could potentially apply,” Fitzsimmons wrote in an email.
Last week, The Chronicle of Higher Education reported that a committee of several colleges and universities, including Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Dartmouth, are soliciting proposals for a new application system that would “improve the experience of applying for college for students and high school personnel,” according to the confidential proposal request, which is dated May 12.
The request also stated that coalition institutions are aiming to create “an application solution” in cases of difficulties or system failure with other application modes, as well as establish “a new collaborative option for individual higher education institutions as they work in their own ways to enroll the very best and most diverse freshman classes they can.”
Currently, students may apply to Harvard through the Universal College Application and the more widely used Common App, which 517 colleges accept. Fitzsimmons wrote that the Admissions Office would continue to use the Common App for the “foreseeable future.”
“Whatever might happen with this third–still exploratory–possibility, we will, as always, encourage students to apply in the way that best meets their needs,” Fitzsimmons wrote. “We will also continue our longstanding policy of allowing students to personalize their applications by using the various optional features of Harvard’s portion of the application.”
According to the request, a public college can join the coalition of institutions interested in a new application system if it has in-state tuitions “that make attendance possible for large numbers of students.” Similarly, private colleges must meet the full financial need of their students, and all institutions that join the coalition must have high graduation rates and low loan default rates among graduates.
Technical mishaps on the Common App are not unheard of. After the Common App unrolled a new web interface last year, the company drew criticism from many students who reported trouble saving information to their application and formatting their essays. During mid-October, weeks before early admissions deadlines for numerous colleges, millions of students could not access the site. Though Harvard did not move back its early admissions deadline of November 1 last year, many colleges, including the University of Chicago, Columbia, Dartmouth, and Yale, did.
Fitzsimmons did not specify when he thinks the third application platform might go up, but the draft of the report indicated the new application system could go live as soon as Aug. 2015.

UPDATED: November 6, 2014, at 2:10 p.m.
Despite a unanimous vote by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Tuesday condemning the University’s changes to non-union health benefits, the new plans rolled out as scheduled on Wednesday.
The annual open-enrollment period for health benefits coverage through the University’s health care plan began Wednesday at 8:00 a.m. and will close in two weeks on Nov. 19.
According to the Harvard Human Resources website, this open enrollment period is the only opportunity for current employees to enroll in health benefits unless they experience a change in status, as defined by the IRS, such as marriage, divorce, or a birth.
University President Drew G. Faust has given no indication that the new plans will be changed given the Faculty’s vote. After the meeting Tuesday, she told The Crimson that she would be “replying in due course,” but declined to comment further.
The new benefits plan applies to the University’s non-union employees, namely administrators and teaching staff, including professors. These members of the Harvard community will see lower premiums under the new plans, but will also be expected to pay up to $250 in deductibles per year for non-routine medical appointments, and to incur 10 percent of the cost of treatment thereafter. The total out-of-pocket contribution from an employee is capped at $1,500 a year and $4,500 a year for families of three or more.
Members of FAS have criticized the policy for being “regressive” for disproportionately burdening women and employees with families. Critics also argue that the changes were unnecessary and that the administration adopted them without transparency.
History professor Mary D. Lewis, who sponsored the motion at Tuesday’s meeting prompting the vote, wrote in an email on Tuesday evening that she sees several options for moving forward with efforts to reverse the changes. She wrote, "the University could change the policy to maintain the 2014 plan design by renegotiating with its vendors, which would probably entail extending the current open enrollment period.  Failing that, it could create a temporary reimbursement fund to compensate faculty and staff while awaiting a return to the 2014 policy, offering a second open enrollment period later in the academic year."
The unanimously passed motion, filed last week, asks “for 2015, the President and Fellows be asked to replace the currently proposed health care benefit plan with an appropriately adjusted version of the 2014 health benefit package, maintaining the 2014 plan design.”
The vote does not require that Faust or the Corporation take any action on the policy but does establish the official stance of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the University’s flagship professorial body.
Non-union staff will receive their benefit cards about two to three weeks after they complete the open enrollment selection.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Business School alumni have created a mobile website that seeks to streamline the often difficult task of splitting a restaurant bill.
The startup, called SplitNGo, was developed at the Harvard Innovation Lab as part of its Venture Incubation Program. Restaurants using the service provide a link to the website, on which customers can pay with credit cards directly on their smartphones.
SplitNGo eases dividing up a bill among a group without the need for complicated calculations, according to co-founder Andres Sarmiento. Once the payment is made on the website, the waiter is notified.
“With SplitNGo, you can split your bill among your friends,” Sarmiento said. “You can do it all at the same time. It just takes a few clicks.”
According to co-founder Steve Gorodetskiy, SplitNGo creates a more secure bill-paying system.
“It’s actually more risky to pay the waiter than to pay using SplitNGo,” Gorodetskiy said. “The waiter takes your credit card and disappears. You don’t know what they are doing.”
SplitNGo adopts a more European style of transaction, Gorodetskiy explained.
“In Europe, they bring the payment piece to the table,” he said. “The card never leaves your hand.”
The service will especially benefit restaurants during peak hours of the day by speeding up the flow of customers, Sarmiento said.
“When the restaurant is full and more people are coming, they’re just turning them away. So, by using SplitNGo, restaurants can turn their tables faster without damaging the experience for the customer.”
Christopher C. Muller, a professor at Boston University’s School of Hospitality Administration and advisor to the co-founders of SplitNGo, called the product a “win-win-win” for customers, restaurants, and waiters.
“Technology like this can be very impactful to the restaurant industry,” Muller said. Customers benefit from having a seamless restaurant experience, restaurants enjoy increased efficiency, and the waitstaff has more time to serve customers instead of working through the payment process, he said.
One Harvard Square restaurant, Grendel’s Den, has begun offering customers the option of using SplitNGo when paying. Placards on tables at the restaurant direct customers to use the mobile website.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students largely expressed positive reactions to the Harvard Teacher Fellows program, an initiative that was formally announced by the Graduate School of Education on Monday and aims to provide training and teaching experience for Harvard seniors interested in entering the teaching profession.
During their senior spring, students can enroll in the program, which will attempt to bring together best practices of existing teacher education programs, said GSE Dean James E. Ryan. Students enrolled in the program will complete coursework and undergo intensive field-based preparation before beginning to teach, and they will have the opportunity to apply to and complete a GSE master’s degree.
“I think the really innovative parts of this are: focusing on subject matter preparation, a significant field-based component, and a reduced teaching load during the first year in the classroom,” Ryan said.
He added that details on the selection process for applicants are still being discussed and will be finalized after a program director is appointed.
The first batch of participants in the program will come from the Class of 2016. Laura K. Brennan ’16, who serves as president of Harvard Students for Education Reform and is enrolled in the Harvard Undergraduate Teacher Education Program, said she sees the program as welcomed relief to a “lack of institutional support” for students interested in education. However, given concerns about the program’s potential overlap with the UTEP, which allows College students to earn certification as secondary teachers, she said she is uncertain about applying to the program next year.
“It starts in senior spring—what does that mean for people writing a thesis?” she said, adding “as someone currently enrolled in the UTEP, it’s not clear to me...if I want to apply to the fellowship, exactly how it will adjust to the parts I’ve already completed.”
Sarah F. Cole ’16, who is pursuing a special concentration in education and American society, said she will definitely apply to the program.
“Part of the reason that teachers are underperforming right now is because we are under-preparing them and aren’t really investing in them,” she said. “This program is an example of ways in which we really can invest in our teachers and make sure they are ready for their classroom experiences.”
Blake A. McGhghy ’17, a member of the Student Labor Action Movement, said that he and other SLAM members hope the new program will avoid what they perceive as some shortcomings of Teach For America, a nationwide program that recruits college graduates to teach in low-income communities for at least two years. McGhghy, along with other members of SLAM, participated in a rally in September to demand that Harvard cut ties with TFA, and cited displacement of committed teachers as one problem caused by TFA.
"We are very excited that Harvard is investing more resources in opportunities for people who want to do careers in public education,” he said. “However, we will continue to demand that Harvard cut ties with programs such as TFA that threaten public schools and teachers.”
However, according to Jon R. Star, a GSE professor who led the development of Harvard Teacher Fellows Program, the new program is not designed to replace other teacher education programs such as TFA.
“We are not doing this as competition with TFA at all. This is complementary, and it is another route for undergraduates to think about pursuing teaching,” he said, adding that the GSE has a “very productive relationship” with TFA.

Graduate Student Council representatives detailed responses to a survey, which found that teaching fellows largely favor smaller section sizes, at their meeting Wednesday night.
GSC Vice President John Gee outlined the results of the 2014 survey for Graduate School of Arts and Sciences students. More than half of the 1,200 respondents indicated that their ideal instruction size is eight to 12 students per section. The survey report went on to recommend reduced section sizes, citing motivations including greater pedagogical value and improved quality of teaching.
The figures also revealed that current or former graduate student teaching fellows wished for more clarification about teaching time requirements.
Over half replied that they would feel uncomfortable saying no to a course head requesting additional work beyond their requirements and a similar number indicated they work eight to 14 hours a week for each section they teach. Of the respondents, 20 percent indicated they had experienced a significant delay—which the survey described as more than two weeks—in receiving paychecks.
Gee said after the meeting that the data seemed to indicate that “TFs as a group appear to be overworked.”
GSC President Summer A. Shafer organized the representatives in a discussion about possible improvements to the teaching experience. Students expressed a desire to introduce ways for previous teaching fellows of a course to provide feedback for future section leaders, such as course instructor evaluations. Representatives also suggested introducing more third-party mediators to act as liaisons between teaching fellows and instructors.
The Harvard Teaching Campaign is currently seeking to place a referendum question on a 12-person section size cap on this month’s Undergraduate Council election ballot. At a UC meeting on Monday, representatives struck down legislation that would have automatically placed the question on the ballot. As a result, the teaching campaign will need to garner 670 signatures by Sunday in order for the question to be included.
Luis A. Perez ’16, one of the organizers of the undergraduate wing of the Campaign, said he is “very confident” that the petition will gather the required number of signatures by the end of the week. Around 400 students have signed the petition so far, according to Perez.
The GSC also appointed an international students representative and filled two vacant positions on a committee on libraries.

By the light of 43 candles, students from the Boston area gathered after dusk on the steps of MIT’s Killian Court Wednesday to begin a march in protest of political injustice in Mexico.
According to the students, the demonstration was an opportunity to demand justice for 43 missing Mexican students from the Ayotzinapa Rural Normal School, kidnapped in Iguala, Mexico, this September. The Mexican students had been planning to organize a peaceful protest against unfair hiring and funding practices in the government when they were halted by the municipal police, believed to be following the mayor’s orders. There is still no word of the students' whereabouts.
“These are college students. These are kids our age,” said Ariana Campos ’16, vice president of RAZA, one of the major Latino clubs on Harvard’s Campus, referring to the missing 43. Although there was a recent march about the missing Ayotzinapa students held in New York City, Campos said, “I would like to see a stronger reaction from Harvard.”
Nathan Goldberg ’18 said he was so outraged by what he called government-organized crime in his country that he was motivated to organize Wednesday’s march. The march started from MIT and ended at the Mexican Consulate in Boston, involving undergraduates and graduates from several colleges in Boston, including MIT, Harvard, and Tufts University.
Marleen Sanchez ’17 said that the march was “a sign to show that we are demanding some action, even here.” Goldberg echoed the same sentiment.
According to Goldberg, the day was designated by a student in Mexico to be a Global Day of Action, which led to university students in Mexico going on strike and protesting.
“We’re trying to do the same thing, show solidarity for the cause, and even if we can’t do much, this is the most we can do here,” Goldberg said.
He mentioned the importance of student activism in light of the kidnappings.
“In Mexico, we look at the news every morning, and see another kidnapping, another murder, another two people, three people, and we’ve almost become numb—it’s an everyday thing,” Goldberg said. “I think this [issue] is big enough that it’s kind of snapped us out of it. It’s not okay for even one person to be murdered or kidnapped.”
After two hours of walking, the group reached the Mexican Consulate, only to have the vast majority turned away by police. According to the Harvard students, officials at the consulate were willing to come out of the building in order to communicate with the group, but the police maintained that they did not have the manpower to control the crowd if something went awry and would not permit entry for the majority of students.
Two students from the protest were allowed entry into the consulate. The others involved stayed outside and, while still holding candles, held a two-minute moment of silence.

Renowned social psychologist Claude M. Steele spoke of the effects and remedies of the “stereotype threat”—a concept that he developed in his influential work “Whistling Vivaldi: How Stereotypes Affect Us and What We Can Do”—at a forum at the Graduate School of Education on Wednesday night.
In a filled Longfellow Hall, GSE Dean James E. Ryan opened the event by underlining the importance of engaging in conversations about diversity, especially in a community of educators. He mentioned that Steele’s “Whistling Vivaldi” is a required summer reading for all GSE students and faculty members.
In Steele’s speech, he summarized years of research that he has conducted on the “stereotype threat,” which occurs when individuals underperform in tasks for which negative stereotypes about aspects of their identities—be it race, age, gender, or nationality—exist. According to Steele, this is because awareness of stereotypes takes up cognitive resources that can otherwise be devoted to performing the task at hand.
Steele mentioned an experiment in which female students did worse than male students on a difficult mathematics test, even though both were equally skilled in mathematics.
“When the test is very difficult, that’s when the stereotype interferes with one’s thinking and processing that is needed to do well in the task, and performance goes down,” he said. “It’s like multitasking.… It takes a toll.”
His research has shown that a solution as simple as informing female students beforehand that “women traditionally perform as well as men on this test” can eliminate the performance gap.
When proposing potential remedies to the threat and in answering a question about what the Harvard community should do in light of these findings, Steele stressed the importance of promoting conversations across group boundaries and putting oneself in others’ shoes.
“[We should] try to see the experience of different students and colleagues from the standpoint of what it is like to be them,” he said. “I think this is one of the most profound challenges that this increasingly diverse American society has to deal with.”
Audience members, many of whom were educators, said Steele’s insights helped inform their own work.
“I work with minority students, and he provided a lot of insights into the external pressures that they face,” said Benjamin J. Felton, a GSE student.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council will receive no funding directly from the University this year, but top Council leaders say the College is considering picking up the tab for about $36,000 the Council currently earmarks for Drug & Alcohol Peer Advisors and Phillips Brooks House Association, freeing up a sizable portion of the UC budget.
The development marks an all-but-official end to an almost year-long campaign by Council leaders to push for increased student group funding.
Last February, UC President Gus A. Mayopoulos '15 and Vice President Sietse K. Goffard '15 unveiled a plan to demand a $250,000 funding increase directly from the University. With public declarations to students replete with impassioned rhetoric about the need for more funding, they convened with several top Harvard administrators and hosted a rally outside Massachusetts Hall.
Gradually, however, their hopes and public prioritization of the funding goal appeared to fizzle. Even as Council leaders continued to disagree with administrators as recently as this week, they have spoken optimistically about a new grant that could be made possible by the College’s potential coverage of DAPA and PBHA funding.
Mayopoulos and Goffard are currently in conversation with the Office of Student Life and the Office of the Dean of the College about a new “bridging and belonging” grant, designed to promote interaction among various student groups.
The grant, whose idea was spawned from a meeting with Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana last month, will serve to fund events “truly co-organized by various different student groups,” according to Goffard. He and Mayopoulos described their conversations with Khurana as productive and said that the college seems to be “very cooperative.”
“We are happy because...this means ultimately more money for students and student groups,” Goffard said.
Still, the Council leaders appear to disagree with administrators on the need for more student group funding.
Goffard said that Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich informed them earlier this semester that “the data show that, in his words, student groups are already ‘amply funded’ at Harvard.” OSL had been gathering data over the summer to assess the demand for more funding.
Friedrich wrote in an emailed statement that OSL has been continuing a conversation about funding with the UC and looks forward to discussing the possibility of the bridging and belonging grant.
Mayopoulos and Goffard said OSL did not allow them to view its compiled data in full, due to the sensitive nature of the numbers. In an email forwarded to The Crimson, Assistant Dean of Student Life Emelyn dela Pena informed Mayopoulos and Goffard that student groups received about $1 million in funding from sources other than the UC, not including funds restricted for particular groups.
Both Mayopoulos and Goffard said, however, that they do not believe the University denied the UC additional funding for purely financial reasons.
“I think there were legitimate concerns that were never explicitly stated, but exist nonetheless, that extracurriculars are distracting from academic life at Harvard,” Mayopoulos said.
Despite that perceived discrepancy, the pair expressed reserved optimism at having pushed for increased funding in the first place.
“[In] the end, we did get an answer for students in the sense that their extracurriculars weren’t funded any more, despite us really making a case for it,” Mayopoulos said.

HUPD has had their hands full with us Harvard students over the past few weeks. Between unchecked bags, stolen soda, and suspicious smells, it seems that a lot's been going on around campus. As part of our Securitas Series, we've combed through recent HUPD logs and published some of the more colorful entries below.
October 13Officers dispatched to a report of an individual who left the area without having their bag checked. Officers arrived and report security identified individual and all was in order.
We’ve all wondered about the consequences of running past the bag check person. Turns out you don’t get mauled by trained angry squirrels as we envisioned.

Officers advised the individual to come out of the restroom numerous times to which they did not comply. Officers then proceeded to go into the restroom and place the individual under arrest for trespassing.
Don’t be so modest HUPD! We all know “proceeded to go into” entails karate kicking down the door with the might of a Bengal tiger.
October 23Officers dispatched to a report of the smell of marijuana. Officers arrived and spoke to the reporting party who informed them of the room that the smell was coming from. Officers spoke to occupants of room and could not detect exactly where the smell was coming from but did inform them that smoking of any kind was not allowed in the building.

Students aren’t the only fashionistas on campus. Harvard profs and TFs have their own unique sense of style, too! Here is a selection of some of our most iconically dressed educators.
Shaye J.D. Cohen may be the Littauer Professor of Hebrew Literature and Philosophy, but he’s known among his students for being the “guy with crazy neckties.” He tells Flyby about his fondness of color and “loud” accessories.
“If I’m gonna be a grown-up and wear a tie, I might as well wear a tie that shouts. If it doesn’t shout—why wear it?”
Dr. Tobias Ritter, Professor of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, is a scientist with an eye for color composition. Far removed from drab white lab coats, he sports a bright orange blazer that pops effortlessly against his navy blue shirt.
When asked to describe his sartorial choices, he shrugs with modest nonchalance. “Colorful, I guess. Professional, but maybe not boring. I try to be a little different.”
Professor of Philosophy Bernhard Nickel wears an easy smile and an earring in his left ear. He describes his fashion philosophy as “classical,” although he seems to add his own retro spin: his towering 6’5” frame is spiffily dressed in a black tie and a pink button-down shirt with a geometric grid of thin blue stripes.
“I really dig the 50s,” he muses. “I enjoy cut and color—texture, not so much. I like everything to be very smooth.” He also confesses that he’s a modernist: “I like modern architecture, so I try to dress like that as well.”
William Baldwin is a Teaching Fellow for the English Department who, in terms of fashion, studies the script. “I’d rather not be creative about it. At least for menswear, there’s a big rich body of rules that you can draw from and learn a lot about over time.”
Thoughtfully dressed up, he dons a black tie, striped blue button-down, and beige suit jacket replete with a folded pocket square. He describes his sense of style as pretty conservative: “It’s jackets and leather shoes and ties. I’m much more comfortable in a suit and tie—a t-shirt feels pretty lazy to me.”

Happy Thursday, Harvard! The weekend is almost here—but really, it is! In honor of the winter slowly creeping upon us, here are some cold weather fashion trends seen around campus:
1) Patagonia on Patagonia on Patagonia: No, it really isn’t superfluous to wear my Patagonia fleece jacket over my Patagonia pullover over my Patagonia long-sleeved shirt.
2) Socks and Sperry’s: When “winter-proofing” your loafers simply means wearing colorful socks under them—now you’re ready to face the snow.
3) Harvard apparel: Great excuse for testing out how warm your Harvard-branded clothes actually are before Harvard-Yale, when you may or may not have gone too hard at the tailgate and end up feeling warm and happy at all points throughout the day.

It’s Freshman Parent’s Weekend, y’all. And if you’re anything like me, you haven’t come up with an itinerary. What to do? Where to go? Your family is looking to you to show them all the excitement the Cambridge life has to offer, apart from the Harvard-hosted events. Little do they know you have spent most of your time in the stacks of Lamont and otherwise know nothing about city life. Don’t worry, I've got you covered. Here are a few events to demonstrate to your parents that you are, contrary to the number of hours spent Lamontstering/Netflix-ing/sleeping/partying, an engaged college student.
Harvard Football vs. ColumbiaSaturday 1 p.m., Harvard StadiumHarvard is playing Columbia today at Harvard Stadium. A pretty low-key rivalry in the Ivy League (the least spirited league in the country) we must admit, but go Crimson!
Boston Comedy FestSaturday 8 p.m., 10 p.m., Davis Square TheatreUp-and-coming stand-up comedian, Ron Funches, will be performing tonight at Davis Square Theatre for the Boston Comedy Fest! It's sure to be a laugh.
The MappariumOpen 10 a.m. - 4 p.m., 200 Mass. AveThe famous Mapparium at the Mary Baker Eddy Library in Boston is a must-see. Not only is it the world’s largest walk in globe, it has awesome acoustics. The quietest whispers can be amplified exponentially. Can anyone say penis game?
Whale WatchingThis seems like a really fun thing to do with your family, especially if you have younger siblings. Catch a boat from Boston Harbour to see humpback and finback whales, dolphins, sea birds, and more. If no whales are spotted, you get a free ticket. Sounds like a deal to me! It’s going to be cold this weekend so make sure to bring the parkas along.
ChinatownTasty, reasonably priced food. There comes a time in a freshman's life when one realizes how overpriced and oddly unsatisfying Cambridge food can be. Please don’t be offended when we do not want to bring you to Annenberg, parents. You can do so much better.

The most notable display of first Amendment rights around campus right now is the Divest Harvard movement, particularly the “Fast for Divestment” campaign that ran from October 20 to October 24. Flash back 17 years, another protest fast took place on campus, this time during 1997’s Freshman Parents’ Weekend. The “Free Tibet” movement protested a speech in Sanders Theater by Chinese President Jiang Zemin. “We are hoping to give Jiang a strong message that people all over the world need freedom and that freedom is a basic human right,” one of the organizers said.
While freshman parents were getting lost around the science center or discovering their kid’s secret stash of empty bottles, they also navigated their way through clusters of protesters chanting “Free Tibet” through the Yard. Some even joined in. The Tibet protest was far-reaching, with monks and Boston community members joining in. The issues may have changed, but a tradition of student activism lives on.
