After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As former Harvard President Abbott Lawrence Lowell, Class of 1877, once said, “A well-educated man must know a little bit of everything and one thing well.” During his tenure as president, Lowell backed his words by restructuring undergraduate education, instituting concentrations and a distribution requirement. But today, the College’s Program in General Education—the modern successor of the original distribution requirements—fails to match the vision set forth by Lowell.
A recent report on the General Education program found it to be “failing” to achieve its initial goals and “occupies no place in the College’s identity,” according to information about the report published in The Crimson. For a program that takes up eight of a Harvard student’s roughly 32 classes, the conclusions the report offers are deeply disturbing. Unfortunately, we hardly find these results surprising.
First and foremost, there is a problem of bureaucracy: In order for a class to count towards one of the eight requirements, faculty members must go through a rigorous process to get their class approved. This process creates inherent inconsistencies in the program; some classes that should count for a given requirement often do not simply because faculty members failed to apply or had applications denied.
Faculty members also cite concerns about Gen Ed courses being more difficult to teach than other classes. This is partly due to a discrepancy in class sizes, as the average enrollment of a Gen Ed class is between 50 and 99 students, compared with 10 to 19 for non-Gen Ed classes. Instead of effectively teaching students about a wide variety of topics, the program causes unnecessary stress for all parties involved.
The more alarming flaw in the Gen Ed program is the lack of a coherent purpose. In its current form, the program attempts to be two things but fails to do either well. According to the report, the program combines a general education philosophy with a distribution requirement structure. Professor Sean D. Kelly, director of the committee that created the report, told The Crimson that “in general the program is nowhere near the best version of what it aims to be.”
A simple distribution requirement would be a much better way of meeting the goal of students knowing a decent amount about many things. This would produce students who are both well-rounded and well-educated by giving students the opportunity to more effectively learn about a wide variety of topics in a system with less rigid requirements.
Unfortunately, with the glacial pace of change at Harvard, we are afraid that any sort of meaningful improvement in the program will not come for years. We hope that any alterations to the Gen Ed program occur as soon as possible in order to maintain the vibrancy and ideals of Harvard’s undergraduate curriculum.
Harvard places a focus on a liberal arts education. The goal is a noble one, but it is clear that the current General Education program has been unsuccessful in achieving its aims. Distribution requirements would more effectively accomplish this goal with greater efficiency and less bureaucracy. It is time to return to a system where Harvard students can truly learn a little bit of everything.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“I have seen this institution change for a lot of reasons. One reason it has changed for good is because of women,” Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid remarked last January. “Women think differently than men.”
There’s normally backlash when 74-year-old white guys pontificate about the inherent differences between genders, but Senators Elizabeth Warren, Patty Murray, and Amy Klobuchar—flanking Leader Reid as he announced their membership in his new leadership team—smiled and nodded. Politicians on both sides of the aisle, men and women alike, have been keen to support the trope of the conciliatory, centrist woman.
Two years ago, after the 2012 elections, ABC News celebrated the record-breaking 20 woman senators of the 113th Congress with a special roundtable interview. “With all due deference to our male colleagues,” Senator Susan Collins told Diane Sawyer, “women’s styles tend to be more collaborative.”
“I think by nature we are less confrontational,” Senator Claire McCaskill agreed.
Why?
“We’re less on testosterone,” Senator Dianne Feinstein opined.
Typecasting all women as collegial and more likely to compromise is unfair and shortsighted. It ignores the tremendous diversity of women’s experiences and personalities and dangerously limits women to the roles that affirm this generalization.
This past midterm, the U.S. reached a record high for female representation in Congress (with a paltry 104 voting members). This is a step forward, but it’s hardly an occasion for self-satisfied back patting. The sobering reality is that we have only five woman governors, and have yet to elect a woman president.
Voters look for strong, decisive candidates for executive office, but women who are firm and forceful rather than conciliatory are lambasted as power-hungry, untrustworthy shrews. In January 2008, CNN host Glen Beck called Hillary Rodham Clinton, then a contender for the Democratic presidential nomination, a “terminator” bent on “stripping away all trace of emotion, femininity, and humanity.” Women are denigrated when they exhibit the characteristics associated with executive leadership positions.
In response to these disparagements, leaders are playing into societal expectations rather than challenging them. The claim that female politicians are “collaborative” and “less confrontational” is simply a modification of the centuries-old dogma that a woman should be seen and not heard. “Collaborative” women end disagreements instead of starting them. They keep the peace instead of leading wars. They embrace an antiquated, oppressive brand of femininity in the mold of the midcentury housewife—sensitive to the personalities of male legislators, listening deferentially. We are preserving a double standard for women politicians. Men can be terminators, but “collaborative” women cannot.
The trope of the conciliatory woman limits women politicians to the few positions compatible with their perceived strengths. We need more women in politics, but not just women who will compromise, build consensus, and never offend. We also need women who will generate controversial ideas. We need women who will crack skulls and whip votes and lead their party into battle. We need women who will become commanders-in-chief and lead our country into battle. Equality can come only when women are free to realize every role that men play in American politics, not just those consistent with a sexist double standard.
The trope of the conciliatory woman may increase women dealmakers in Congress, but it inhibits the election of women to governorships, presidencies, and other executive offices. Above all, it denies women the right to define themselves and still be viable candidates. That’s not real progress.
“Collaborative,” “less confrontational” dealmakers have a place in Congress, but legislators of all genders have the responsibility to work together and get things done, and women should not have to “think differently than men” to be elected and respected. We can achieve true equality only when women are free to be both bargainers and bomb-throwers. Typecasting all women as collaborative peacemakers may help shatter glass ceilings in legislative bodies, but it reinforces glass ceilings for executive offices—and the stereotypes and double standards that erected them in the first place.
Let’s stop using the trope of the conciliatory woman. Bipartisan compromise is great, but compromising with glass ceilings is not.

“Enter to grow in wisdom. Depart to serve better thy country and thy kind.” So it is written above Dexter Gate as one enters Harvard Yard.
I came to Harvard to slake my thirst for knowledge. I wanted to learn more about mathematics, but I had vague wild designs to learn about everything else too. I wanted to study quantum mechanics and molecular biology and organic chemistry. I wanted to broaden my horizons. I didn't know anything about politics or economics, but Harvard seemed the perfect place to learn. Harvard is full of knowledge, and full of knowledgeable people.
I think I have gained more knowledge here than in my entire life before college, and that gets me excited. It also leaves me daunted. The more you know, the more you know you don't know. “Of making many books there is no end, and much study is a weariness of the flesh,” reads Ecclesiastes 12:12. And yet at least we know where to get knowledge. There may not be enough hours in the day to learn it all, but we know which books to read, and which professors to ask.
But I wonder where we learn wisdom.
“Enter to grow in wisdom...” Wisdom is different from knowledge. When I think of wisdom, my first thought is not of my classmates or even my professors (though many of them are wise). I think of my parents and grandparents. I think of old priests and much-loved pastors. I think of Paul the security guard in Quincy House. Old saints, robed in graciousness and dignity, patience and peace. That is what wisdom looks like.
Old saints, I must emphasize, are not the same thing as heroes. Saints are not perfect. But that's not what being a saint is about. In her book “Still: Notes on a Mid-Faith Crisis”, Lauren Winner has quoted Samuel Wells as saying: “A saint can fail in a way that the hero can’t, because the failure of the saint reveals the forgiveness and the new possibilities made in God, and the saint is just a small character in a story that’s always fundamentally about God.” As Winner remarks, “It turns out the Christian story is a good story in which to learn to fail.”
That's the kind of truism that I can only repeat secondhand. I don't really know what it means yet. Let's not fool ourselves: We have to grow into our words. There are whole books, like “Brideshead Revisited," that I can read and understand and yet know that I won't really understand it until I've lived it. Wisdom seems to be found only at the end of a long, slow road.
And now it is time to depart, to take our clumsy first steps along that long road, “to serve better thy country and thy kind.”
I hope someone teaches me wisdom, that I may serve better, because I can't bear to settle for less. I don't want to live a boring, trivial, wasted life. I don't want to be climbing a corporate ladder, or making money for money's sake, or living for those fancy academic letters after my name. God help me, I need to live for something bigger than myself.
“He has made everything beautiful in its time. Also He has put eternity in their hearts, except that no one can find out the work that God does from beginning to end.” Ecclesiastes 3:11.
It's been a wild old time here at this rather good school in Boston. It's been a time of intellectual growth and exploration. I didn't expect to get hooked on philosophy and theology above all else. I never could have imagined that I would spend more time reading the Bible than any other book during these Harvard years.
And little did I know how much joy I would discover in writing. Which brings us, dear reader, to the end of “Unapologetics.” This semester, we've considered such diverse topics as the problem of suffering, the relation of science and the Christian faith, the concept of sin, the vision of community. Through these topics I hope to have suggested something of the warp and woof of Christian thought, and its expression in art, poetry, literature. I have not given a systematic, rational defence of the faith. Take these remarks only as rough brushstrokes, words gesturing at experiences. Maybe with more time they might have been made systematic. But it is always time to move on. God is always ahead of us.
Not long until Commencement now. The pre-nostalgia begins to set in.
May we depart to serve better.
Et gloria in excelsis Deo.

After almost 10 years of delays and disputes, the town of Weston and Harvard’s Arnold Arboretum have settled a lawsuit and agreed on a nearly $14 million land deal, which will include Harvard paying for partial cleanup of portions of land that contain high levels of arsenic, according to a press release.
Last year, the Board of Selectmen of the Town of Weston, Mass., voted to file a lawsuit when Harvard allegedly failed to “remediate” contaminated portions of 62.5-acre Case Estates, which the University had agreed to sell to town, per the terms of a 2010 contract.
The property is located near the intersection of Ash, Wellesley, and Newton Streets in Weston. Harvard first acquired the property at the center of the dispute in the 1940s from Marian Case, for which the estate is named. The Arnold Arboretum made use of the land of the estate for gardens and educational facilities, according to to the Weston Town Manager’s website.
In 1985, the Arboretum sold 35.65 acres to the town of Weston and in 2006, voted to sell the remaining 62.5 acres as well. But as Weston was finalizing plans to finance the purchase, engineers examining Case Estates discovered high levels of pesticides and agricultural chemicals from before Harvard’s ownership, when the property was an apple orchard.
“I am pleased that Harvard and Weston are moving forward together in a collaborative spirit that underscores a collective commitment to land preservation, community uses, and education,” Arnold Arboretum Director William Friedman said in a statement.
One portion of the land known as the “Hillcrest Corridor” will be used for all agricultural and recreational purposes, and a 14-acre wooded part will be reserved for walking and biking, according to the press release. The rest of the property could be used for new home construction.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
College seniors debated the value of donating to Senior Gift late last week as the Undergraduate Council’s former president critiqued the annual fundraising drive and his peers sparred over the initiative by sending GIFs over a class email thread.
The Harvard College Alumni website touts the Senior Gift, an effort by members of the College’s graduating class to solicit donations from their peers, as an “opportunity to educate Harvard students about the importance and impact of alumni giving, and to encourage classmates to make their first gift to the College.”
Over the years, however, questions about students’  financial status, inclinations to contribute, and where their money will be used have prompted student skepticism about the fundraising drive and a wide range of debate.
This year, that debate took on new life when some students flippantly replied to an email from Gift organizers urging their peers to donate in the drive’s final hours. Responses over the email thread, to which seniors replied last Thursday, included GIFs mocking the Senior Gift and single lines of commentary including “My Senior Swift: One teardrop-stained guitar” and “Guess I'm the only one participating in Senior Twitch.”
According to Sietse K. Goffard ’15, the class’s first marshal and the former vice president of the UC, the thread ultimately spanned more than 150 email messages.
“[T]his thread definitely crashed my phone's gmail app,” Samuel T. Kim ’15 wrote on the thread.
Beyond GIFs and one-liners, though, the thread included heated debate about the value of donating to Senior Gift. Former UC President Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15 sent a lengthy message over the thread explaining why he had chosen not to give to Senior Gift, citing his desire to make a statement to alumni about College administrators and how they engage with students.
“I’m tired of everyone pretending that everything is great here, or that even if we don’t think it is, we’re willing to smile for the alumni - and that is the message that [I] *personally* feel I would be sending to the alumni association by giving to the senior gift,” Mayopoulos wrote.
Following the email debate, the gift’s deadline was extended to midnight on Sunday.
Reflecting on the debate surrounding the gift this year, Goffard said some of his peers are questioning the impact their donations may have, particularly in light of the University’s ongoing $6.5 billion capital campaign.
“The backdrop of the whole Harvard Campaign and the large donations in the past years have made people have second thoughts or questions about the impact of the donations,” he said.
In an interview, Mayopoulos said he thinks members of his class are recognizing that the administration has not “dealt openly with them all the time,” citing the surveillance cameras placed in classrooms without undergraduates’ consent and plans to close overnight infirmary hours at Harvard University Health Services, among other administrative decisions.
“I think that students are better informed about these issues than they have been in a long time,” he said.
Mayopoulos also said many people have been “turned off” by the idea of donating in part because of what he described as the Senior Gift Committee’s aggressive approach to courting donations. Mayopoulos said he originally had not intended to comment on the email thread but ultimately wanted to articulate from the perspective of “someone who spent time trying to make Harvard [a better place]” that there are a number of ways to give back.
In response to last Thursday’s  email thread, Senior Gift Co-Chair Tianhao He ’15 acknowledged seniors’ concerns “about the email etiquette of the Senior Gift Team” in an email on Friday co-signed by the other chairs. He’s email acknowledged that the Committee had failed to bcc recipients of the email that sparked the debate.
“Spoiler alert: we are human and we slip up sometimes,” He’s email said.
He’s email also contained a link to a form for seniors to give feedback to the Senior Gift Committee.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Closing arguments in the trial of a man charged with the May 2013 murder of a Harvard University security guard were presented on Friday before a jury in Suffolk County Superior Court in Boston.
According to the Boston Globe, the defendant, now 29-year-old Boston resident Devone Suber, had pled not guilty to the charge of fatally shooting 35-year-old Maiqi Hernandez and wounding another woman in Hernandez’s Roxbury apartment.
Prosecutor Edmond Zabin, Suffolk County Assistant District Attorney and chief of the District Attorney’s Homicide Unit, stated in the closing arguments after two weeks of testimony that, although hot-tempered, Hernandez, a father of two, had no enemies besides Suber with any motive to kill him.
Prosecutors alleged that Suber and Hernandez had an argument in the Prentiss Street apartment building just after midnight on the day of the shooting. According to the prosecution, Suber left the building, then returned with a gun shortly after midnight on May 3, shooting Hernandez in the chest when he opened the door to his apartment.
Boston police stopped Suber on Annunciation Road about 10 minutes after the shooting, using a physical description provided by Hernandez’s friend Angel Delgado, who witnessed the shooting. Suber was carrying a box of .357-caliber ammunition with five cartridges missing, which, according to prosecutors, could have been used in the murder weapon. Suber claims to have found the ammunition.
Eduardo Masferrer, the defense attorney, questioned the reliability of the prosecution’s key witness, Delgado, who had falsely stated to police that Hernandez had not used alcohol or cocaine on the night of the shooting and whose description of the shooting was partly inconsistent with the testimony of other witnesses. Masferrer also pointed to the fact that no gunshot residue had been found on Suber’s hands and claimed that inconsistencies in Suber’s testimony resulted from a learning disability.

UPDATED: May 12, 2015, at 9:15 p.m.
British students said they generally felt that their peers at Harvard showed interest during the recent elections in the United Kingdom last Thursday.
In the election, Prime Minister David Cameron retained his position as the UK’s Conservative Party received 37 percent of votes and 331 seats in Parliament. The Labour Party, led by Ed Miliband, received 232 seats.
“A lot of people were asking about it,” Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 said. According to Sachee, who is from England, the British Club hosted a viewing party of election coverage for British students. Other students hosted individual viewing parties as well.
In addition, the Institute of Politics hosted a “General Election Party” on Thursday, inviting its attendees to “learn about the world’s oldest parliamentary democracy,” according to their website. The Center for European Studies also hosted a panel on the election on April 30 with speaker Edward Fieldhouse, who served as principal investigator of the “2015 British Election Study” at the University of Manchester.
Hannah R. Phillips, a student from Scotland who watched the BBC coverage in her room, said that student interest in the election “depends on who you hang out with.”
“My British friends were obviously very concerned,” she said.
Nicholas J. M. Bonstow ’17 agreed, adding that most British students were “very engaged” with the election. Bonstow is from England and is an inactive Crimson editor.
Despite the positive reactions, Sachee and Phillips added that discussion around American elections will always be more prominent.
“American elections are going to be bigger because it’s right here, but I think there was enough awareness,” Sachee said.
“I know a lot of Americans who know what’s happening, but I didn’t expect anything more than there was,” Phillips added.
According to Bonstow, Americans can “learn so much from British politics.”

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: May 12, 2015
An earlier version of this article misstated the percent of the popular vote earned by the Conservative Party. In fact, it received 37 percent of the vote, not 51.

When junior Alister Bent and classmate Sindhu Vegesena step onto the volleyball court, there are two obvious characteristics that set them apart from their fellow teammates.
For one, both are clad in a different color jersey than the rest of their teammates. More significantly, both players are among the shortest on their teams.
The different color and smaller size have the same explanation: Bent and Vegesena are liberos—a special defensive position in indoor volleyball that is responsible for controlling serve receives and converting them into solid passes. The libero remains in the game at all times and is the only player who isn’t limited by the rules of rotation.
“They’re not allowed to hit over the net at all,” Bent said. “Basically their role is to be the primary serve receiver, so they should be the best passer and the best defensive players as well.”
In a game where height is traditionally an advantage, the fact that the shorter liberos stay in the game at all times may seem like an inconvenience. However, their lack of height is far from detrimental.
“Defense is actually easier when you’re shorter,” sophomore setter Corinne Bain said. “You can dive easier and be closer to the ground. It gives you more time to dig the ball.”
Dressed in a different color jersey so officials can easily track their movements, liberos emerged internationally in the late 1990s. While the direct aim of introducing such a position was to improve defense and ball movement, it also indirectly gave shorter players a chance to continue their volleyball careers.
At 5’7", Bent jumped at the chance to swap from his high school position of outside hitter to libero, as it meant being able to play college volleyball.
“I definitely wouldn’t have had an opportunity [to play college volleyball] coming out of high school being 5’7”," Bent said. “Having the libero position was definitely a chance for me to come into the program. It’s been huge in that respect."
However, other liberos such as Vegesena took a different path and developed at that position from an early age. Chosen for her high energy and desire to control the ball, Vegesena was taught how to channel these aspects of her athleticism into becoming a libero.
“I started playing club volleyball as a nine-year-old on a 12’s team, so I was shorter…than all my teammates,” Vegesena said. “I was also hyper and the worst kind of ball hog, so having that [libero] jersey gave me an excuse to behave the way I did.”
Now standing 5’8", Vegesena has come a long way from her childhood volleyball days. As libero, Vegesena is responsible for a much larger part of the court than her teammates.
The libero has been compared to the goalkeeper in the sense that it’s the job of the libero to prevent any balls from hitting the ground. On the other hand, the position also bears similarities to football quarterbacks because liberos are the first to touch the ball off the serve and therefore control the trajectory of the pass to the setter.
“When the ball’s coming to you, there’s no hiding,” Bent said. “Any ball that’s going and it’s not clear who’s ball it is, it’s the liberos. It’s their job to hustle and make sure nothings hits the ground…. Communication is key.”
Although the height requirements to play a libero are a prerequisite, the mentality required to hit the ground again and again in each game without having the satisfaction of scoring is something that needs to be cultivated. Vegesena’s discipline to play such a position came from her coaches as she got older.
“It was easy to physically sacrifice myself, but mentally I was completely undisciplined,” Vegesena said. “My coaches cracked down on me hard. I think for liberos there’s a certain standard of dependability and mental toughness that’s expected.”
The mental toughness in discussion comes handy when on the court. With volleyball serves capable of travelling almost 100 miles per hour, liberos face the daunting task of reading the server and reacting to their serves in a split second.
“We’re trained to read bodies and angles from the backcourt,” Vegesena said. “But there are times when plays are too fast to read and your body just reacts. I’d say that’s my favorite part [of being a libero].
These nuanced challenges faced by the libero can be lost upon the crowd during matches. When all eyes are on the hitters who are scoring the points, it’s easy to overlook the foundation on which all offensive play is built—the libero.
On the court, however, it’s a different story.
“If the libero’s having an amazing day, it’s very noticeable to the players on the team,” Bain said. “It might not be noticeable to the crowd, but it’s definitely noticeable to us. Libero’s make all the difference to the rest of us.”

UPDATED: May 12, 2015, at 9:19 p.m.
Take out the brooms. Again.
For the second year in a row, the Harvard women’s track and field team swept away the competition to take home the Ivy League Outdoor Heptagonals title, out-throwing, jumping, and running the field for a total of 157 points, 39 points more than second place Princeton.
It was also the second year that the women swept both the indoor and outdoor Heps title; over the last three years, the Crimson women have taken five out of the six indoor and outdoor Heps championships.
The men took sixth place with 54.50 points behind the Tigers.
“I thought they [all] competed fantastically,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “They had a fantastic meet. I thought our student-athletes competed extremely well [and] I’m really proud of them.”
The competition started off on a high note for the Crimson as senior Taylor DuPont threw a personal best 53.88 mark in the hammer throw to claim third. Classmate Hannah Mayer place second in the javelin with a mark of 44.56 meters.
On the men’s side, sophomore Elliot Safo claimed third with a 7.17 meter jump in the long jump, and in the hammer throw, captain Ben Glauser returned from injury for the first time this outdoor season, claiming fifth with a throw of 58.37 meters.
The success of day one continued on the track, where freshman Courtney Smith and senior Whitney Thornburg claimed personal bests and all-time Crimson top-10 finishes in the women’s 10,000 meter race. Smith placed third with a time of 34:53.67, while Thornburg claimed fourth with a time of 35:04.25.
Day one ended with the women in second and the men in fifth—both behind Princeton—setting the Crimson up for a fruitful second day. But day two got off to a quick start in the field events for Harvard, as sophomore Nikki Okwelogu delivered once again for Harvard, as the Fresno, Calif., native broke her own personal and Ancient Eight record in the shot put, throwing a mark of 17.32 meters.
Okwelogu claimed her second gold of the day just a few hours later, taking home the discus title with a mark of 53.78 meters, further than the previous meet best. For her efforts, the sophomore was named the Field Athlete of the Meet.
“Nikki is a special competitor,” Saretsky said. “Her performances were outstanding, and she was incredibly deserving of the [award]. She’s now won that indoors and outdoors, and they’re very well deserved.”
The track events also provided many points for the Crimson, especially on the women’s side. Junior Paige Kouba started off the day with a third-place finish and school record in the 3,000 meter steeplechase, clocking in at 10:15.81.
Much like at the Indoor Heps, the sprints turned out to arguably be the team’s strongest area, with multiple individual titles coming from stellar performances from Harvard runners.
Senior Danielle Barbian took home the 100 meter dash title, setting an Ivy League record with a time of 11.59 seconds, with classmate Ashley Collinsworth close behind her at 11.79, good enough for third.
In the 100 meter hurdles, junior Autumne Franklin took home the title with a time of 13.70, with sophomore Jackie Modesett close behind with a time of 13.89 for a third-place finish.
In the 400 meter hurdles, sophomore Jade Miller took first with a time of 57.30, a meet record, with Franklin close behind in second with a time of 58.31. Modesett took fourth, clocking in at 59.41.
In the women’s heptathlon, junior Madison Hansen took home an Ivy record and title with a total of 5,506 points, just two points ahead of the previous Ivy mark.
On the men’s side, captain Jarvis Harris led the team with a first place performance in the 400 meter hurdles, clocking in at 51.10—a personal record and the third-best performance in Harvard history. Harris also took third in the 110 meter hurdles with a time of 14.36.
“In the grand scheme of the entire weekend, I think I can definitely walk away proud,” Harris said. “I performed really well [and] I gave my best effort in all of my events…I definitely can say that I’m quite pleased with this Heps performance.”
The 5,000 meter race saw junior Tom Purnell take fourth with a time of 14:38.40 in what was arguably the most exciting race of the day. The junior was separated from first place by less than a second in a race that came down to the wire.
“The future is quite bright for us,” Harris said. “We’ll have people who will be coming back…the freshmen and sophomores were really good this season and have gotten their feet wet this first year and they’ll be a lot more comfortable.”
While the women will undoubtedly celebrate their title over these next few days, Saretsky insists there is still work to be done. The team next turns their attention to IC4A’s as well as NCAAs; after sending a program best seven athletes to Eugene, OR., last year, Saretsky believes the team can improve on that number.
“That’s what we’re striving for,” Saretsky said. “As a program each year we’re trying to get better, we’re not satisfied where we’re at…. We want more and that’s what we’re working towards.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After two rounds of play at the NCAA Regional tournament in South Bend, Ind., the Harvard women’s golf team found itself in a similar position as 2014—on the bubble fighting for a spot in the national championships. However, after posting its worst team score of the three days in Saturday’s final round, the Crimson dropped out of qualifying contention and finished 10th.
“To be where we were after two rounds felt pretty normal to us, which was great,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads said. “We were pretty optimistic going into the [final round], and we weren’t trying to do anything different…. We just didn’t play very well today, which was unfortunate. I don’t think it was nerves…. We just didn’t play very good shots today which made scoring a little bit tough.”
Building off her strong Ivy Championships performance two weeks prior, senior Brenna Nelsen, who is a Crimson sports editor, led the charge for Harvard with a 4-over showing in her final collegiate tournament, leaving her in a tie for 14th on the individual leaderboard.
After opening on the back nine Thursday and making the turn a stroke over par, Nelsen tallied three-straight birdies on the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th holes to propel her to the only sub-par round of the tournament for the entire Harvard team.
The senior’s three-round score of 220 was also just a few shots off pace to qualify her for the NCAA Championships as an individual. While this past week turned out to be her last competing for Harvard, the tournament represented a comeback of sorts for the Monte Sereno, Calif., native.
“I was psyched for Brenna—[it was] not surprising at all given how good of a player she is,” Rhoads said. “She dealt with way more injuries than anyone should have to during her time, and it wasn’t any different this week…. Her technique and her mind [were] in a good place…. It was a nice way to finish her career.”
Though the tournament did not finish with the outcome that Rhoads and the rest of the team may have been hoping for after their near-qualifying performance the previous year, it did cap a season that saw Harvard win its fourth-consecutive Ancient Eight title, which is the longest streak in Ivy League women’s golf history.
“Although the other teams wouldn’t have distracted us, it’s a natural thing [to feel pressure] when you have a potential first time thing on the line, because no other Ivy team has ever come close to making nationals,” Rhoads said. “We were four shots off last year, and we were in position again this year.”
After tying for fourth at the Ivy League Championships, sophomore Anne Cheng and junior Courtney Hooton finished tied for 21st and tied for 36th, respectively, to buoy the Crimson squad to a top-10 finish after the group finished in 13th in last year’s NCAA Central Regional.
Cheng had a three-day score of 222 at the Warren Golf Course, going the entire week without a double-bogey or worse. The performance came a year after Cheng recorded a top-10 finish at last year’s NCAA regional as a freshman.
“I think we see this as a learning experience to have the opportunity to be here and to be this close,” Cheng said. “We’ve really progressed far as a golf program. It’s been a great opportunity, and we’ll try again next year.”
Shooting out of the third spot for Harvard, Hooton had a stellar second day with an even-par 72. She sandwiched Friday’s round with first and third round scores of 77.
With Rhoads’s squad graduating just two members—Nelsen and captain Tiffany Lim—this year, the team will have yet another Ivy title and a chance to qualify for the NCAA Championships in its sight.
“Our team is unique in that we all have a lot going on outside of the team,” said Lim, who shot a three-round total of 237 at the regional. “[But] over the summer, some of the [members of the team] will set aside a few weeks from their jobs and internships to practice their golf game.”
