After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Some of the things the audience participates with are so funny and often really crude. It's hard not to break character and laugh along with them,” says actor Bobby Malley ’20, who will play Brad in the “Rocky Horror Picture Show.” Presented by the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club, this cult classic will come to the Adams Pool Theater on Feb. 17 and Feb. 18.
In this classic tale, a newly engaged couple, Brad and Janet (Sara Bobok ’19), find themselves stuck in the rain when their car breaks down. Looking for help, they come to a castle that is owned by Dr. Frank N. Furter (Patric C. Verrone ’18), a transvestite doctor who just so happens to be throwing a party unrelated to Brad and Janet’s arrival. During the festivities, Dr. Frank N. Furter reveals his greatest creation yet, Rocky Horror (Henry R. Lynch ’20), a man created to sexually please his master, and declares that he will be returning to Transylvania. Meanwhile, Riff Raff (Ben G. Cort ’18) and Magenta (Sumner N. Perera ’19), the house butler and maid, take the opportunity to reveal their true intention: leaving the planet.
While some audience members are sure to be familiar with the show’s 1975 film version or theater performances, HRDC promises a unique experience that synchronizes and showcases features of both the film and live adaptations, all on one stage. This fusion did not come without challenges. “Figuring out how to stage with the movie behind the actors so that the actors are creating characters anew at the same time that they are honoring older performances is difficult,” says co-director Julia E. Belanoff ’18.
Despite the strangeness of the show itself, the Rocky Horror Picture Show engages relevant themes. “A lot of the show is science fiction,” says Perera. “Planets, aliens. It’s very strange and weird. But even in that craziness and in this world, I think there are a lot of elements of truth within it. Specifically, the show talks about an awakening of your sexuality, becoming more free and truthful with yourself.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 14, 2017 at 5:40 p.m. 
Just as bright lights and high-pitched ringing accost someone when waking up from a coma, they also ended the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club's production of “A Kind of Alaska.” HRDC put on Harold Pinter’s play in a cozy black box theater, in which director Thomas W. Peterson ’18 assembled a skilled cast for a simple production that successfully channeled all focus to the dialogue and actor’s expressions.
The play begins with Deborah (Eliya Smith ’20) as she wakes up after a twenty-nine year coma. Her doctor (Chloe A. Brooks ’19, an inactive Crimson editor), who is scripted as male but played by a female actress, accompanies her from her first moments of consciousness, filling in some gaps of information in spurts that still leave bouts of mystery. After a series of discussions and revelations, Deborah’s sister Pauline (Brooke E. Sweeney ’17) enters the room to reunite with her younger sister. This reunion illuminates facts hitherto unknown, and Deborah enters a frantic bout of physical motion and mental outcries. Lighting signals a shift. Scenes move from external experiences to those happening inside the mind. In the last few minutes, Deborah narrates her thoughts and reactions in chronological order, exiting the stage in a bath of light.
The cast impressively portrayed a spectrum of complex characters. Smith convincingly executed a challenging physical role that involved lying very still, standing up with partially atrophied limbs and enduring a crazed episode. She encapsulated Deborah’s mental confusion aptly as well: Her eyes often welled with tears and other times encapsulated laughter, and she conveyed Deborah’s sass and personality with grace. Both Brooks and Sweeney further energized the dialogue with clear facial expressions and deep gazes. Brooks’s doctor was both excited and sad. He was earnest in describing the truth of the world Deborah awoke to and his attempts to protect her from it. Deborah’s sister’s empathy was palpable, and her devotion even more so.
At some moments the crisscross of emotions was especially poignant. At others, the show fell flat. Lengthy moments of silence filled with fixed eye contact and wavering lips left something to be desired. At one point the doctor announces that he had not woken up Deborah earlier because he had not been able to obtain the right awakening fluid, a moment that should have been tragic but just sounded humorous.
Part of the reason the focus was on the actors’ facial expressions was the simplicity of the set. The stage was mostly empty with a few sporadically placed pieces of furniture: a hospital bed, a chair, and a table. The costumes were also minimalistic: a hospital gown dressed Deborah, the doctor wore a black outfit reminiscent of Steve Jobs and a doctor’s white coat, and Pauline wore a simple grey sweater and jeans. Each was distinct but not individually striking.
The lighting brought color to what would otherwise have been a black and white world. The changes in lighting facilitated the transition between the external world and the internal. The reliance on lighting, however, proved a little melodramatic. The signals were clear, but perhaps too well defined. Sound also accompanied transitions of light. The cutoff of background noise denoted the start; a high-pitched ringing prefigured the ending. These indicators combined with long silences notable only for intense gazes slowed down the pace of the production, which only displayed the show’s weaknesses. The expected occurred, and seemingly complex feelings remained superficial.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: February 14, 2017
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that "A Kind of Alaska" was an American Repertory Theater production.

The audience at the Tsai Auditorium broke out in laughter at one at point on February 8 when the performer onstage animatedly related the story of Seibei, an unfortunate antiques collector. “Samurai are sensitive to heads falling off,” a Japanese merchant told Seibei, who had just sold a Buddha statue to a samurai. Seibei gasped with his face screwed up, setting off another roar of laughter, fearing that the statue had broken at the head and that the samurai would seek revenge.
This is rakugo. Yanagiya Sankyo and Yanagiya Kyonosuke, two masters of the 400-year-old art of Japanese storytelling, came to Harvard on Feb. 8 to perform “Tsuru” and “Ido no Chawan,” two tales in the classical repertoire of Japanese stories. The event was presented by the Edwin O. Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies and the Consulate-General of Japan in Boston.
The night began with remarks by Harvard’s Japanese professor, Wesley Jacobsen. “Through this Japanese art form, we realize there is a universal, human element,” Jacobsen said.
Despite the simplicity of the art form, the human element communicates itself clearly. Yanagiya Sankyo took his place on an elevated platform to demonstrate gestures used in rakugo. Taking off his sandals, he sat kneeling on a small cushion. Dressed in traditional Japanese silk robes with wide sleeves and solid color, he had two props with which to animate his stories: a small folded paper fan and a kerchief. A solemn tone accompanied the rituals onstage. But levity returned when Sankyo demonstrated eating, crying, running in the rain, and getting drunk—one person weaves a story, enacting the various characters with seamless transitions.
After the demonstrations, Yanagiya Sankyo performed “Tsuru,” a story about how eager but forgetful Haichi learns the story of how Japan’s symbolic bird, the crane, got its name. He tries to tell the story to a friend, but his memory fails him. The next tale, “Ido no Chawan,” performed by Yanagiya Kyonosuke, centered on honest Seibei, the itinerant antiques collector, who buys a statue of the Buddha from the poor but virtuous samurai, Chiyoda. Seibei then sells the statue to another samurai, who, finding money hidden in the statue, summons Seibei to return it to Chiyoda. Seibei finds himself stuck running errands for two virtuous clients.
The “human element,” comes through in the moral meaning of each tale: the folly of one’s eagerness to show off in “Tsuru” and the foolishly strict adherence to one’s values in “Ido no Chawan.”
But the nonverbal aspect—namely, performers’ commitment to strong facial expressions—is equally prominent. The effect of the minimalist use of props is striking in “Ido no Chawan.” The age-old maxim, less is more, finds its full force in rakugo.
Yanagiya Sankyo and Yanagiya Kyonosuke first brought their art out of Japan for an international convention in Paris. Other American universities, including the University of Michigan and MIT, have also hosted the performers for rakugo demonstrations. But the future of the art, cherished as it is in the academic sphere, is uncertain. “It’s very difficult to teach,” Yanagiya Sankyo said, through a translator. “What they were doing in the Edo period is very difficult to understand.”
But rakugo’s ability to communicate without words may help it achieve a degree of universality. “Some of you laughed because of the Japanese,” said Yanagiya. “Some of you laughed because of gestures. That pleases me.”

John Darnielle has presence. In pictures, he appears nebbish, his hair youthfully shaggy and his glasses askew. One assumes that the genius behind the band The Mountain Goats—adored with cultish fervor—and the 2014 book “Wolf in White Van” must possess all the stereotypical qualities of an introverted, reluctant genius: powerful, though nervous, self-effacing, and solipsistic. Yet onstage at the sold-out Brattle Theater, promoting his recently released sophomore novel, “Universal Harvester,” Darnielle was comfortable and charismatic, as genial as your Midwestern uncle and as thrillingly erudite as your favorite professor. He first addressed his audience with an extended riff on deep vein thrombosis, and when a ringing phone disrupted him, he archly admonished the audience member at fault: “You silence that phone or I’m coming down there. Did you think that rule didn’t apply to you? I silenced my phone.”
A reedy tenor on record, Darnielle is a resonant baritone in person, and even then, his style of speech depends on the activity he is engaged in. As he stood at the podium, reading a passage from “Universal Harvester,” his voice was soothing and deliberate, a pitch-perfect approximation of an audiobook reader’s. Darnielle’s prose is not flashy, yet it is deeply rhythmic: one automatically understands that he has spent the last quarter of a century fitting lyrics to meters. His sentences expand and contract like breathing creatures, and they brim with evocative details, the kind that made his albums—“All Hail West Texas,” “Tallahassee,” “The Sunset Tree”—the classics they are.
Darnielle said that “Universal Harvester” began to take shape after he thought through one simple question: When Iowans have family reunions, why do all the conversations focus on where people wound up, instead of how people are doing? As for the title “Universal Harvester,” Darnielle explained that it was the name of a company which sounded heavy metal to him as a teenager (“It’s like the cold hand of death, man!”) He even named his pet Egyptian spiny mouse “Universal Harvester.”
In conversation, Darnielle discards the gravitas and becomes a motormouth, holding forth on his preferred topics with humor, enthusiasm, and clarity. His interests are impossibly diverse. In his dialogue with author and host Kelly Luce, he managed to touch on Theodore Roethke, Anton Bruckner, John Cage, and Parliament. When asked about the elements of horror in “Universal Harvester,” Darnielle discussed his fascination with such movies as “Bride of Frankenstein” (which, he theorized, is a Greek tragedy), “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,” and “Silent Night, Deadly Night,” the controversial 1984 slasher film. “It’s horrible in every aspect,” he said of the film. “I’ve seen it four or five times.”
While such a conversation might seem hopelessly diffuse, Luce guided Darnielle with rich questions and witty comments into divulging useful insights into his craft. Bringing up Truman Capote’s dismissal of Jack Kerouac’s work (“That’s not writing; that’s just typing”), Darnielle refuted it with a shrug, a grin, and three words: “Well, typing’s good!” he said. “Writing is first labor, then inspiration.” In other words, he explained that he types and types without an explicit purpose, then prints out his work and reads it aloud while pacing.
When Luce wondered if art and fiction function differently post-election, if such powerful tools for connection and empathy ought to be employed towards political ends, Darnielle said that becoming a political writer requires discipline and that one could not simply wake up as one. Citing the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, he said, “the scales fell from my eyes,” insisting that one could not remain unmoved by society’s struggles. He advised first listening and absorbing if one is not personally familiar with such a topic, instead of tackling it uninformed.
Darnielle’s responses to questions from the audience were equally illuminating. When asked how he decided the placement of cathartic moments, which appear often in his work, Darnielle replied that he never goes looking for them. “Catharsis comes from caring about your characters and believing them as people,” he said. When asked about the moment he knew he had a talent for words, Darnielle confessed that he still does not know, but said that he began to take himself seriously once he recognized the masters—“Willa Cather, Joan Didion”—and discovered humility at their feet. He recommended against writing to gratify your ego. “It’s not a good reason to write, to show people that burning itch you have to write. It’s a very dude reason[.]... Stop trying to impress yourself,” he said. In response to a comment about his focus on adolescence, Darnielle said that he wants to forgive his younger self, and that he wants to explore the gap between the kid who makes mistakes and the adult who knows well enough not to make them. “Once you have that knowledge,” he said, “you can’t imagine yourself not having it.” Darnielle says that his writing then becomes a form of self-reflection. “It’s a process of self-improvement,” he concluded.

As a former engineering student, Michael J. Kline most likely never envisioned himself teaching a pottery masterclass through the Ceramics Program at the Office of the Arts at Harvard. Yet following his passion led him to just that on Saturday, Feb. 11—not to mention a successful career as an artist. Kline became a studio potter in 1993 after earning a BFA from the University of Tennessee. His work is featured in various magazines and books and made an appearance in the 2007 film “Craft in America.” He sat down with The Harvard Crimson to discuss his path as an artist over the years.
The Harvard Crimson: When did you realize you wanted to pursue pottery?
Michael J. Kline: I knew right away when I touched clay. It’s almost a cliche, but I knew there was something about this material that I really responded to, maybe in … a subconscious way. I just really liked the way it felt and I … wanted to gravitate towards it, and later I found out that people actually did have successful careers working with clay and being artistic. But that unfolded slowly over the next few years.
THC: Did wheel pottery come naturally to you?
MJK: No, actually…the pottery wheel is a very technical device; you needed skills to learn. So I remember being really frustrated with the wheel, but I was persistent. So with lots of different people helping me—and repetition—I finally learned how to use the tool. But it was the clay itself that really kept me engaged. You can just approach clay with your hands and form it … Clay had a really immediate reaction, although it did have rules that I had to learn, that I continue to learn as I explore other ways of forming, but I think the immediate response is what really gave me confidence to explore it.
THC: What have been some milestones in your career?
MJK: The milestones may be more typically when my parents acknowledged what I was doing as a young person. Coming to an art show…was the point where they understood that there was a security in the field that I was pursuing. It was something I could make a living at. The other milestone that happens over and over again is—in a funny way I guess you’d call it a milestone—I finally built my own personal studio, after many years of renting facilities and being in a community studios and institutional places. I built the studio about eight years ago, and that was quite an accomplishment, to have my own place. And I still think from time to time … “Oh, this is my own place, and this is all from the success I’ve made with the pottery in my career.”
THC: What do you draw your inspiration from?
MJK: Well, a lot of historical pottery. I seem to be fascinated by the readily available history of ceramics. And in a more subtle, subconscious way, the landscape around where I live; the mountains in North Carolina. So there’s sort of a variety and a puzzlement of the way the landscape exists that fascinates me. The hills, the ways we get through that landscape; trails, or even climbing a mountain, and looking down on the landscape. I think there’s all these different perspectives that keep it infinitely interesting, and in a subconscious way as a part of my encounter with making pots and clay. I use some clay from the fields, so that’s inspiring—the material itself is inspiring to me. Although it’s kind of a bankrupting process of digging clay. I can buy clay really easily from a supplier, but there [are] parts of my process that really sustain me, and I think we use the word inspiration as a way of … [describing] what sustains you in a creative process. You want to sustain yourself and continue to inspire yourself.
TCH: Do you have a signature style or technique that really defines your work?
MJK: One of the most significant signatures is my brushwork, which is mostly floral motifs in a very dense pattern, and another thing I’ve been doing in the last few years is based on a Korean technique of inlay. The surface of the clay is stamped and or carved and then those impressions in the clay are filled with a different color slip, which is like a liquid clay. So there [are] two different colors of clay put together on a unified surface. I’ll see an image on Instagram that somebody’s tagged me [in] saying, “Oh, this is inspired by Michael Kline’s inlay work.” So it’s really nice, and I guess part of that is me putting out [my work] into the internet.

With a pink wall and fairy lights draped around a fireplace, the Leverett Library Theater was transformed for “A Valentine’s Day Cabaret.” The first official Harvard College Musical Theater performance, this cabaret performed on Feb. 11, just in time for Valentine’s Day.
Carolina P. Ribeiro ’18, the president and founder of HCMT, said the show is a new way to showcase musical talent at Harvard. “[Cabaret is] a really casual way to come and perform songs that they maybe wouldn’t perform through HRDC. Songs that they really like” said Ribeiro. “[The event was meant to] let people know what we are about [and] see passion, voice, and personality really shine through.” Sarah B. Rossman ’19, Cabaret Chair, felt the show was particularly well-received because of its nearness to the upcoming holiday. “[The audience expects] love because it’s Valentine’s Day themed,” she said.
Unlike a typical musical, a cabaret offers a casual collection of performances ranging from comedic to tragic and with sources from “High School Musical 2” to “Fun Home.” Ribeiro mentioned that the range of options offered by a cabaret can make them particularly interesting.  “[I] like the opportunity to see people perform songs that they get to choose themselves and that they see themselves in and seeing what kind of spin they give characters when they’re playing this song. It’s really different, I think, from what we see in an HRDC production, where the casting choices are made by someone else, usually a director. This time people really have ownership and clearly love the songs,” said Ribeiro. She added that the rehearsal process also differs from a typical production. “It’s like a lower-time-commitment version of a show hanging out with the people you would normally do a show with but without the rehearsal ten hours a week.”
Although this was the first time everyone working on the show had been together in one room, the performance got strong positive feedback from the crowd. Audience member Meghan Onserio ’19 was particularly enthusiastic about the production.  “It was really good and I really loved it, just watching people shine,” she said.
After Ribeiro and Chris S. Lee ’18 founded HCMT in the fall, Rossman joined as the Cabaret Chair, handling HCMT’s cabaret production. After a few months of rehearsals, “A Valentine’s Day Cabaret” hit the stage. “This is something we’ll get to do at least once a year, but hopefully once a semester from now on,” said Rossman.
When asked about the inspiration for directing the cabaret, Rossman said that it offers new roles that wouldn’t be found elsewhere. “I like that it gives people [a space] to play roles that they otherwise would not be able to get cast in. For example, I will be singing a non-traditionally female song, which I’m super pumped about,” she said. “Musical theater makes me happy and it makes a lot of people happy.” Ribeiro agreed with the importance of the focus on musical theater. “People come here and see what it’s all about. [We are] trying to promote musical theater on campus and let people shine in whatever way they see fit. We want people to bring themselves into the work,” she said.

On February 11, members of the Cambridge and Boston communities convened at Harvard Square’s Grolier Poetry Book Shop for a Valentine’s-appropriate poetry reading. The 90-year-old business resides amidst Harvard’s campus on Plympton Street. This particular event featured poet and Harvard College alumna Therese Sellers ‘82. The site of the reading held particular sentimental value for the author herself. “The Grolier is this famous, celebrated center of poetry and I certainly came [while in college] and browsed to look at the books to get some of the Grolier inspiration,” Sellers said.
Sellers read ten poems from the published anthology “Dark As a Hazel Eye” and answered questions from the crowd of twenty people that filled the small poetry shop. A successful poet, Sellers publishes haikus on her popular Twitter account and is the author of Greek nursery rhyme book “Alpha is for Anthros.”
A collection of 52 poems comprise “Dark as a Hazel Eye,” each written by different authors ranging from emerging to renowned. These poems find a unifying theme in drawing inspiration from and featuring either chocolate or coffee. The seductive power of chocolate and coffee inspired the bookshop to schedule the reading near Valentine’s Day, and many couples came out to the reading. To supplement the auditory experience, chocolate and coffee were available to taste.
Sellers began her reading with her own poem, a collection of five haikus about coffee. When asked about her sources of inspiration, she pointed to events and happenings from her daily life. Of the five haikus that made up her contribution, Sellers credited one to “the lid of a Dunkin Donuts Coffee cup” and another to “my fierce determination to stay in bed in the morning even when all of society and all social pressures are telling me to get out of bed.”
After reading her favorite ten poems from the anthology, Sellers shared a new poem. Departing from the event’s proclaimed topics of coffee and chocolate, she expanded upon the Valentine’s theme with a haiku about people on the T carrying roses for their sweetheart. Immediately after, she opened the floor and answered questions relating to specific poems, their historical significance, and the publishing process.
Doran cited some of the financial options that Grolier is exploring to make their business model sustainable, including finding ways to host more readings and renting out larger spaces. “There’s difficulty in running a small independent business in Harvard Square,” she said.
No Harvard students attended the reading—the majority of the audience was nearer middle age. “I would think it would be wonderful if more Harvard undergraduate poets would collaborate more with this historic book store,” Sellers said. The successful poet hoped her own fondness for the store could be shared with more undergraduates.

A dinner party? Look no further than the 2010 California Cabernet. An evening concert?  Wear an Armani three-piece. An impossible assassination? Call John Wick. In a genre some perhaps would itch to define as tasteless, the hitman action-thriller “John Wick: Chapter 2” uniquely makes connoisseurship its hallmark. Getting outfitted for the next kill is as simple as visiting the “Sommelier” (a gunsmith in the Wick universe) for a private tasting of German and Italian firearms, the local cartographer for ancient maps of Roman catacombs, and of course the tailor for something with sartorial taste and bullet-proof lining.
Sidestepping the unimaginative sequel naming formula “Whatever Movie 2” the follow up to 2014’s “John Wick” opts for the more literary “Chapter 2.”  Keanu Reaves returns in the role of the eponymous ex-hitman dragged yet again from retirement, this time to Italy in order to fulfill a blood oath he gave years earlier to a fellow assassin (Riccardo Scamarcio). While he may not like coming back to the scene of international contract killings, one can’t expect a guy with “Fortis Fortuna Adiuvat” (“Fortune Favors the Bold”) tattooed on his back to stay at home with his dog for all that long. Littered with a who’s who of supporting actors—Laurence Fishburne (of “The Matrix”), Ian McShane (of “Deadwood”), John Leguizamo (of “Ice Age”), Lance Reddick (of “The Wire”), hip-hop legend Common (of “Selma”), and the eternal Franco Nero (of “Django," “Django Unchained")—this journey to Italy makes an effort to build an expansive world in which to unleash hell with style.
And the carnage does not disappoint. The kinetic fight choreography is executed with aplomb, whether it is Reeves versus dozens of trained killers or Reeves versus dozens of taxi cabs (or both). Of course, this is what one should expect, since director Chad Stahelski is a veteran stuntman and stunt coordinator himself. Unfortunately, when the scene isn’t filled with action, which thankfully it mostly is, the direction tends to slouch into cheesy flashbacks, graphic novel subtitles or video game-inspired aesthetics. Although they are always done with good humor, and certainly worth a laugh or two, these moments chafe against the film’s tasteful ambitions, with mixed results overall.
That’s not to impugn the director’s taste unilaterally. To his credit the film contains several homages to the great action films of the past, which takes the film’s connoisseurship to the action genre itself. The opening shot of the iconic motorcycle chase scene from Buster Keaton’s “Sherlock Jr.” projected on a NYC skyscraper, which syncs up Keaton’s skidding through a window with a modern motorcycle skidding on its side, shows a sense of discernment and appreciation for the history of the action film genre.Paired with the scattering of Italian sculpture on display throughout the film, the “classical” action film nears art historical “classicism” with an eye for elegance. At first glance, “Chapter 2” may seem like a maximalist display of non-stop action, but when compared to similar franchises like “The Fast and the Furious,” the Wick films come through with a refreshing simplicity: one man, one gun, many villains.
The irony of humanist pleasures in a film with a staggering body count can only be taken with humor, though one can’t help leaving the theater wanting either further debasement and self-parody, or even better, through exploration of Stahelski’s refined artistic interests. Even though the film’s high-brow tastes never come fully into contiguity with its middle-brow ones, “Chapter 2” remains a satisfying offering from a skilled team of actors and filmmakers. Also, watching Common attempt to speak Italian is a treat all unto itself.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Halfway through my freshman year, a good friend took me to a sorority punch event. It was my first foray into the Greek life scene, and I was nervous. This was a space I knew wasn’t always welcoming to black bodies or queer love. But once there I fell right into it, singing at the top of my lungs, dancing with friends and strangers. My fears seemed unfounded. And then “Gold Digger” came on.
Any black person who’s ever been to a college party knows what happened next. My friend and I were dancing with a larger group―all white, and all strangers. Jamie Foxx sang the hook, Kanye jumped in, and two white men, bigger than me, older than me, and louder than me, looked me in the eye and yelled out “She ain’t messin’ with no broke NIGGAS.”
I immediately left the dance floor. I was truly and honestly shaken. I’m sure the two wanna-be Yeezys meant no harm. But their actions held more at stake than the spine-chilling history of the word, and how it terrifies me when it slides out the lips of a white man. It’s about what these two men thought they could do. For them, “ni**a” was just a word, and a Kanye song was just a couple of beats and a catchy hook. They had no problem taking control of the situation, the music, and the language, because it meant nothing to them.
I’m not going to waste space explaining what hip hop means to the black community, how it has become an art form of liberation and a culture of black self-love. I hope that’s clear already.
But what people still fail to understand is what this means for white listeners and artists. There’s something wrong when white people feel empowered to spit a racial slur on the dance floor or while rapping along to the Jay Z blaring in their headphones. There’s something wrong when people like Post Malone and Eminem see the cultural implications of hip hop and decide to enter that space regardless. And there’s something wrong when a party, hosted by a majority-white sorority, DJed by a white man, and attended by an overwhelmingly white crowd, plays Kendrick Lamar’s “Alright”, the rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement, as a party jam. White people know what hip hop means to black people. They just don’t care. That is, many white people know that hip hop has historically been a mode for black liberation. Yet they feel empowered to devour the culture and dispose of its bodies.
Let’s get back to Kanye for a moment. “Crack Music”, one of his early hits, features the hook “It’s that crack music ni**a, that real black music ni**a.” It’s a critical exploration of America’s obsession with hip hop. “Now the former slaves trade hooks for Grammys / This dark diction has become America’s addiction,” he spits cynically. In other words, hip hop sells, because black sells. White America’s always had a fetished fascination with black culture, from socialites ducking into Harlem to Charleston with Count Basie to hordes of hipsters in line to see “Moonlight”. So, like Kanye, black hip hop artists have happily kept “baggin’ up this here crack music” and doling it out.
But what happens when that’s not enough? What happens when white people get tired of being the guest, and want to become the owner? These days, there are more white hip hop artists than ever. And, like chameleons, they decide to blend in with an updated version of blackface. They wear chains and locs. They twist their tongue to “sound black.” How many of these artists, I wonder, spoke out after Flint, or marched with Black Lives Matter? They perpetuate mindless consumption and appropriation of black culture without acknowledging or caring about the community who uses it as a means for freedom and expression of grievance.
These artists have opened the door for today's party culture. I've walked down the street on a Saturday night and heard historically white final clubs blaring “F*** Tha Police”. I've had countless drunk white people sling their arms around my shoulders and bellow out “Ni**a!.” I've seen sorority girls wail to Drake and then rationalize their vote for Trump the next morning. Too many white people think they're entitled to hip hop, but not responsible for the people hip hop was meant to save. Thanks to Iggy Azalea and Macklemore, the soundtrack to black liberation has been hijacked. They’ve taken perhaps the most important and defining piece of black culture and reduced it to a Spotify playlist titled “Get Lit”.
So, what? White people should stop listening to hip hop? Well ... it’s complicated. A good start would be seeing final clubs diversify their next punch class, or Young Thug fans publicly support BLM. If white college kids can consciously examine their use of “ni**a” or their support of Action Bronson, I’ll consider it a step in the right direction. To quote Ms. Lauryn Hill, “You can’t just call hip hop a trend!” Remember, those Chance bars you love to spit out mean a lot more than a fun Saturday night.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 1989, as the Berlin Wall came toppling down and the Soviet Union began to fall apart, Francis Fukuyama proclaimed “the end of history.” Although he was referring to what he considered the triumph of the Western liberal idea, that phrase has acquired a variety of meanings. In a stroke of great irony, we can now observe the end, or at least hiatus, of one history: that of a truly unified United States.
Today, the US is riveted by divisions and polarization: in race, religion, ideology, politics, and more. The truth itself is clouded and contested, highlighted by the advent of “alternative facts.” Driving it all, at the core, is a growing fundamental divide in belief of what defines our nation.
It is in this context of crisis in our liberal democracy that we must consider the speech given recently by Senator Marco Rubio during the Attorney General confirmation hearings. A number of the words that were said, especially relating to broader ideas and at the beginning, were absolutely correct. Can anyone contest that “debate [is] impossible if matters [become] personal?” And his statement, “I don’t know of a single nation in the history of the world that has been able to solve its problems when half the people in a country absolutely hate the other half,” rings with an intuitive truth.
The superficial correctness of some of these larger sentiments, however, only makes the faults in the speech more egregious.
Beneath Senator Rubio’s words is a deep bias. To claim that one half of the country hates the other seems itself a gross exaggeration, and it also implies that one side is specifically to blame. However, the dislike, the sheer political polarization, is mutual, running in both directions, and this implication is both disingenuous and dangerous.
There is also a deliberate ignorance of reality. With a few exceptions, the recent history of Washington has been unrestrained partisanship. How can the senator proclaim with zeal that “this isn’t a partisan issue,” when partisanship is what has driven Washington? Was the confirmation of Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court not a partisan issue? Or the budget conflict that led to government shutdown? When does partisanship end and begin, and on what types of issues?
Perhaps most importantly, the senator does not go far enough; he does not carry his arguments to their logical conclusion. It sounds good to declare the essential necessity of decorum and evenness in debate. While true, he fails to acknowledge a key component of that necessity: that it, debate, is a prerequisite to compromise. Compromise drove the founding and history of this nation. It is not enough to simply acknowledge the validity of the other side’s argument but not work together, not take the best of each side’s stances, and not craft a better solution for all that is acceptable to all. That, I would argue, was the aim of the founders in crafting a government founded on debate and checks between branches of government.
Senator Rubio acknowledged that when his colleagues disagree with him, he tells himself “I don’t agree, but I know why they’re doing it; because they represent people who believe that.” There is a difference, however, between acknowledging and understanding, between noting and incorporating. Even now, we witness Congressmen falling in line with their party more and more. This is a fault of both major parties, but the end result is the same regardless: Compromise continues to slide away and the Senate becomes less and less an institution predicated on comity.
I applaud the senator for many of his words and for driving at the heart of the dysfunction that has increasingly characterized our government. In his own words, “we are reaching a point in this republic where we’re not going to be able to solve the simplest of issues.” In that, he was completely right.
It is a shame, then, that there is much he omitted, whether in in the interest of party lines or his own belief and conception of our ideals. But these omissions only allow our ills to fester, and if we continue to fail to confront them, we will indeed witness an end of our history, in one way or another.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The English Department’s recent proposal to add a diversity requirement for concentrators is a bold and laudable move. In the midst of an ongoing discussion regarding diversity in thought and how best to emphasize it at the College, the proposal is certainly a welcome shift and we hope that other departments also consider this important precedent.
If approved next week by the Committee on Undergraduate Educational Policy, the motion submitted by the English faculty would go into effect for the Class of 2020. It would require future English concentrators to enroll in a course involving writers “marginalized for historical reasons.” The criteria for “marginalization” include authors writing about issues such as “racism, patriarchy, and heteronormativity,” and focusing on courses with ethnic or women authors, according to the English Department Chair James Simpson.
This proposal is commendable and reflects extensive discussion that has taken place about measures to increase diversity in coursework. Nevertheless, it is imperative that the department ensure that the classes that satisfy the new requirement truly reflect historically marginalized communities in the United States or abroad, especially since Harvard has had difficulties offering these types of courses in the past. We hope that the diversity requirement will create greater demand and incentive for these types of classes to be offered to students.
More broadly, we call for all applicable academic departments—namely those in the humanities and social sciences—to follow suit by diversifying their syllabi and course options, moving away from the typical canon of Western male authors that these departments tend to highlight and emphasize. This  shift would allow for reflection on the ideas that these diverse voices add to the ongoing conversations in disciplines such as political and social theory.
To build on top of these goals, every Harvard student ought to consider taking courses on non-Western authors and schools of thought at some point during their four years here. It is all too easy to take courses at the College that focus entirely on Western thought. One way to achieve this would be for Harvard to add a General Education requirement on diversity of study, focusing on ideas not traditionally a part of the Western canon. These new Gen Ed courses would highlight marginalized communities whose voices have been barely considered or explored, providing Harvard students with the tools to consider worlds vastly different from their own.
Historical and cultural diversity continues to be a salient issue for many at the College, as various fields of student life and academics have discussed the best way to be inclusive and welcoming to all. Expanding course choices and requirements to reflect the pluralism that exists in the student body is a powerful impetus that will expose Harvard students to new ideas that may previously have not been a focus. It is reassuring that the English Department’s proposal indicates an understanding and acceptance of this idea.
We urge the Committee on Undergraduate Educational Policy to pass the English Department’s motion at their meeting next week. It will mark an ongoing transformation and empower future classes of students who come through Harvard to gain exposure to authors whom they might never have encountered or considered in novel educational contexts.

Harvard College received 39,494 applications to its Class of 2021, setting a new record for the third year in a row and surpassing last year’s total by 450 applications.
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67  attributed the 1.2 percent rise in applications to the popularity of the College’s new Theater, Dance, and Media concentration, its financial aid program, and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
This year’s applicant pool saw a 12.3 percent increase in students interested in studying computer science, building off a 22.1 percent increase in interest in the field last year.
The pool also saw a 3 percent increase in prospective humanities concentrators. In a press release, Deborah Foster, director of Undergraduate Studies in Theater, Dance and Media, said she was “astounded” by the number of high school students who had contacted her about the new concentration, which kicked off in 2015.
The racial and ethnic composition of the pool was similar to that of last year, but saw small increases across several groups: 21.8 percent of applicants identified as Asian American, 12.6 percent as Latino, 10.5 percent as African American, and 2.3 percent as Native Americans and Native Hawaiians. In an interview, Fitzsimmons said the admissions office would continue to ramp up its recruitment of students from minority backgrounds in the coming years.
“The reality is if you don’t recruit a very diverse student body, your university will be less relevant to the country as time goes by, and it’s not a mystery to see what the country’s going to look like,” Fitzsimmons said.
The number of women applying to the College increased by 2.5 percent, and women comprising 49.9 percent of the total applicant pool.
“When I attended Harvard it was 4 to 1 male to female. Women could not use the undergraduate library. Women could not go into the front door of the Harvard Club of New York until 1973,” Fitzsimmons said. “It’s been changing pretty rapidly.”
The Class of 2021 will be the first class subject to the College’s penalties on members of final clubs and Greek organizations.
While the geographic composition of the applicant pool was also similar to previous years, Fitzsimmons said a nationwide plateau in the number of graduating high school seniors—particularly in the Northeast and Midwestern United States—could decrease applications from those regions in the coming years. Conversely, the Southwest and the South, as well as certain Western states such as California, will experience an increase in high school seniors.
Fitzsimmons said that President Donald Trump’s recent executive orders regarding immigration and travel to the United States did not impact this application cycle because the application deadline was January 1, nearly three weeks before Trump’s inauguration.
Going forward, though, Fitzsimmons said he plans to continue the admissions office’s pursuit of top students from around the world, and to direct various Harvard services to assist them in the process of obtaining a visa and arriving in Cambridge.
“We will just continue to take the best students, wherever they’re from, whatever their citizenship is,” Fitzsimmons said.
Harvard has already offered admission to 938 early applicants from a pool of 6,473, representing a 14.5 percent acceptance rate—the lowest since the College reinstated its early action program in 2011. Last year, the College accepted a record-low 5.2 percent of applicants to its Class of 2020.
The College will release admissions decisions on March 30, and admitted students will have until May 1 to accept or decline their offers.

Chomping on donuts and sipping hot chocolate, freshmen reveled in the snow Monday courtesy of a Undergraduate Council-sponsored snowball fight in Harvard Yard.
Though Cambridge saw heavy snowfall throughout Sunday, most courses were held as usual Monday. Despite the slushy conditions, students said the UC’s spontaneous funding of winter treats left some students feeling better about the prospect of continued classes.
Students like Diana Ding ’20 gathered to converse with friends, while others played in the snow.
“I think it’s a really fun idea,” she said. “It’s really simple, but it’s something that everyone will want to come to, and I’m really excited.”
Finance Committee Chair Neel Mehta ’18 said he decided to come to the freshmen event to see the UC’s money in action, as well as to participate in the snowball fight. Approximately 50 students munched on the snacks and lobbed snowballs at each other.
“I have never been in a snowball fight in college, so this is a very, very good thing. I’m so glad they put it on,” Mehta said. “One of the best ways we’ve spent $200 dollars.”
Though Lily B. Ge ’20 didn’t throw snowballs, she braved the cold and viewed the event as a respite from her academics.
“This definitely was a really good study break. It feels better than to have to go buy food for myself,” she said.
Lourdes A. M. Kaufman ’20 said despite low temperatures, the snowball fight offered the freshmen class an opportunity to enjoy each other’s company.
“It’s a lot of fun—very cold, but worth it,” she said. “Definitely community building, lots of fun hanging out with our classmates.”
Elm Yard representative Adam E. Harper ’20 said he came up with the idea for a freshmen-wide snowball fight over the weekend while sitting indoors with his friends. Harper said he immediately contacted Freshmen Class Committee members, according to Elm Yard representative Salma Abdelrahman ’20.
“It was actually pretty quick,” she said. “Adam just texted the FCC—Freshman Class Committee—group chat and was like ‘Let's do a snowball fight...let’s do something that will build community and bring people together.’”
On Sunday night at the Council's general meeting, Harper presented an ultimately-successful piece of legislation to allocate $200 of the Council's money to purchase supplies for a freshmen snowball fight.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences approved a revamped General Education program in March 2016, University President Drew G. Faust hailed it as a “historic moment.” The overhauled program, scheduled to take full effect in fall 2018, will replace a Gen Ed curriculum described in a 2015 FAS report as “failing on a variety of fronts.”
But for students currently attending the College, the gradual move to the new program has been less momentous. Among current juniors and seniors straddling the transition between the old and new Gen Ed programs, the changes have been met with a range of reactions.
The overhauled Gen Ed program will require students to complete classes in four new Gen Ed categories, fulfill a distribution requirement, and take one numerical reasoning-based course. For the Classes of 2017 and 2018, though, the old requirements are still in place—though the selection of classes that count for Gen Ed credit has expanded to allow those students to “benefit from the spirit of the new program,” according to the Gen Ed website.
Over the summer of 2016, the Office of Undergraduate Education retroactively changed some students’ academic records so that courses previously not listed as Gen Ed courses now fulfilled requirements.
“The vast majority of juniors and seniors have a lot more flexibility than they had before, and we have heard from many of them who are really happy with how the transition is going,” Stephanie H. Kenen, Administrative Director of the Program in General Education, wrote in an emailed statement.
But some students—including Daniel V. Banks ’17, a former Undergraduate Council Vice President—said the change penalizes students who fulfilled their Gen Ed requirements before the change.
“They reward people who did not do their requirements earlier on in their college career,” Banks said. “I would have had a few more classes at Harvard that were actually important to me and educationally fulfilling, and instead I was retroactively told that what I did two years ago was a waste of time.”
Others, including Liz Kantor ’18, said their records had not changed under the new system.
“Before the transition, I had six Gen Eds and I have two left to do, so it hasn’t really affected me at all, “ Kantor said.
“Obviously, I want to take fewer Gen Eds,” she added.
Kenen acknowledged that some upperclassmen would not benefit from the changes, but said the Gen Ed office wanted to begin implementing the new program as quickly as possible.
“There are, however, some juniors and seniors who had already fulfilled most of their Gen Ed requirements,” Kenen wrote. “ They, unfortunately, cannot benefit from the same flexibility as some of their peers.”
Though Mary Jiang ’17 said the Gen Ed changes had not impacted her academic record, she added that she hopes future students will continue to take classes outside of their comfort zones under the new program.
“I’m guessing the administration wants to make it more flexible students for students. I really hope that doesn’t come at the cost of students not being required to confront classes they haven’t wanted to take before,” Jiang said.
Sean J. Kinyon ’18 said he was optimistic about the new Gen Ed curriculum, praising the new program for allowing students to take divisional classes to fulfill requirements.
“I think it’s really cool to provide some more flexibility for kids so that they can stay within their comfort realm but study it within other realms as well,” Kinyon said.

Since President Donald Trump’s election in November, University President Drew G. Faust has faced mounting pressure to take a stand.
Students have rallied in Harvard Yard, urging the University to protect its undocumented students. International affiliates have asked for support after Trump signed an executive order barring immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries. And professors have voiced concerns about cuts in research funding.
At the helm of an institution that has much to lose under some of Trump’s proposed policies, Faust has had to respond.
“Whatever our personal political views, emotions run high and feelings deep in what for many is a challenging and uncertain time,” she wrote soon after the election. “Violence, hatred, and divisiveness put all of us at risk; they put our society at risk; they put the very idea and purpose of universities at risk.”
But as Faust has taken a more active approach to national politics, her position as president of one of the most renowned universities in the world has both limited and enabled her ability to push for change.
Harvard is designated a 501(c)3 organization—a tax-exempt status that prohibits universities from endorsing or opposing political candidates. According to Internal Revenue Service guidelines, “leaders cannot make partisan comments in official organization publications or at official functions of the organization.”
Harvard relies on this tax designation to maintain its endowment, as Faust explained in a letter to members of Congress in April.
“Universities are meant to be nonpartisan; we are nonprofit institutions and that is an aspect of that privilege that comes with that privilege,” Faust said in an interview. “And we want to focus on issues that matter to us and the resolution of issues that are central to higher education, not on taking sides in partisan disputes.”
Amid widespread fear and uncertainty, Faust has toed a line between taking action on behalf of the University and maintaining the nonpartisanship she is bound to as the leader of a tax-exempt institution. But as some of Trump’s policies have continued to affect the University’s work, that line has become increasingly blurred, and Faust finds herself regularly responding to political developments when she used to do so more sparingly.
“Whether it’s a political issue or a faculty member has done something outrageous and people are saying ‘won’t you denounce this person?’—I just don’t see myself as denouncer-in-chief,” she said in an interview Friday. “I see myself as upholding values and upholding principles and advancing agendas. And I think that’s the role I should be playing.”

'Ramping Up'
Harvard has long operated a federal relations office in Washington, D.C., and many other universities maintain similar offices. Since 2011, Harvard’s lobbying arm has spent roughly half a million dollars on advocacy efforts each year—a number that held steady for 2016.
But after Trump’s election, Faust said in a December interview that she will be “ramping up” her own lobbying efforts this year, and Harvard’s Associate Vice President for Public Affairs and Communication Kevin Casey said the amount of money Harvard spends on lobbying will likely increase in 2017.
On Faust’s agenda when she meets with lawmakers are three priorities: federal research funding, financial support for education—including financial aid and avoiding an endowment tax—and the University’s ability to “attract talent from all over the world.” During the campaign and in the early days of his administration, Trump has proposed or enacted policies that affect all three areas.
In January, Faust met with members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, including Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and minority leader Charles Schumer. She plans to visit Washington again in April.
“When I said I was ‘ramping up’ I was thinking of my personal involvement, and how much time I’m spending in Washington as part of my overall schedule and what outreach I personally want to do and be engaged in,” Faust said.
Faust has been a vocal supporter of the DREAM Act, which offers a legal path to residence for some undocumented immigrants, for many years. She signed a letter in December with university presidents across the country defending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, an executive order signed by former President Barack Obama in 2012 that offers legal protections undocumented young adults. During his campaign, Trump pledged to end the program.
Faust has also spoken to Senators Dick Durbin and Lindsey Graham about advocating for the Bridge Act, bipartisan legislation that would provide legal protections to undocumented students if Trump eliminates DACA.
While most of her political advocacy has centered on Capitol Hill, Faust joined other university presidents in sending a letter to Trump condemning his Jan. 26 executive order, which bars immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries—Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen—from entering the United States for 90 days. While a temporary stay suspended the order, its future remains uncertain.
Not a 'Denouncer-In-Chief'
Some students, however, feel that Faust should go further. In a letter to Faust in January, student  activists urged Faust to take a more active stance on specific campus issues they argue are increasingly relevant with Trump’s political agenda.
Calling on administrators “to embark on a course of action that upholds our community values in the face of a new political reality,” student activists outlined a series of demands for change on campus, including divesting the endowment from fossil fuels, supporting undocumented students, hiring a Muslim chaplain, and creating an Ethnic Studies department.
After Trump’s immigration order, Faust announced in a University-wide message that Harvard would hire its first Muslim chaplain. But she declined to label Harvard a “sanctuary campus,” and maintained in an interview Friday that the University would not divest from fossil fuels.
“It’s heartening to see students engaged with such a wide range of issues and the passionate way they feel about them and the energy they put into promoting them, and so I very much appreciate that,” Faust said in an interview. “There are a lot of good ideas that they’re espousing. There are other ideas that we’re not going to accept.”
Although some recent University actions take a stand on political issues—such as calling for ending Trump’s immigration ban—Faust herself has never referred to Trump by name in her official communications.
“I think if you look at anything I’ve written and said, you will never find a person named in any of it,” Faust said in an interview. “People want me to denounce this or that or another person over the years, and I don’t think I’ve ever done it. Ever.”
Instead, Faust frames her statements in terms of higher education’s priorities. This focus formed the basis of two amicus briefs Harvard filed with other universities challenging Trump’s immigration order. Both briefs—one submitted to a Boston federal court on Feb. 4 and the other filed Monday in a federal court in Brooklyn, N.Y.—structure their arguments around the importance of maintaining American universities’ global networks.
The executive order, the Boston brief argues, “undermines the values and contributions of open academic exchange and collaboration.”
In a letter to the Harvard community about the order, Faust wrote, “Amid this widespread doubt and unease, we will continue to insist that policymakers take full account of how fundamentally our universities depend on the ability of people to travel across borders without undue constraint.”

The Harvard Management Company named Brian C. Rogers ’77, a prominent investment manager, to a position on its board of directors Monday.
Rogers’s appointment comes during a period of major reorganization at the firm. In January, HMC's newly-appointed chief executive N.P. Narvekar that he would lay off around half of the 230-person staff and move to outsource the bulk of HMC’s investments to external managers.
The changes mark a major strategy shift at the firm responsible for managing Harvard's $35.7 billion endowment, which has long used a unique "hybrid" investment model that kept the bulk of its assets invested by internal staff but also retained external firms.
Narvekar lauded Rogers’s experience in asset management in a press release and emphasized the role Rogers will play in the firm’s restructuring.
“It is an honor to welcome Brian to our Board,” Narvekar wrote in a statement. “I am confident Brian’s experience in asset management will be extremely valuable as we develop new investment and risk frameworks to support our new investment model.”
Rogers currently serves as chairman of the Baltimore-based investment management firm T. Rowe Price Group, a position which he has held since 2007. He holds degrees both from Harvard Business School and the College, where he lived in Mather House and concentrated in Economics.
“HMC has a long history of creating significant value for Harvard University and I am delighted to be able to contribute to the organization’s next phase of succes,” Rogers wrote in the press release.
Rogers currently sits on a number of boards, including the Johns Hopkins University and Johns Hopkins School of Medicine Boards of Trustees and the investment committee for Vanderbilt University. He is the HMC board's 11th member.
HMC has struggled to keep pace with its peers in a market that has been difficult for large institutional investors. In fiscal year 2016, the firm posted its worst investment returns on its investments since the nadir of the financial crisis, and the endowment dropped nearly $2 billion in value.  According to to University President Drew G. Faust, HMC's lackluster returns are expected to constrain University budgets for years to come.

Harvard Hillel and the Harvard Islamic Society hosted a presentation and panel discussion Monday, briefing attendees on Islamophobia at Harvard and around the United States.
The event, called “Stand Up Against Islamophobia,”  was the first in a series of events hosted by Harvard Hillel called “Stand Up,” aimed at engaging Harvard's faith groups and addressing discrimination against religious minorities.
Amitai B. Abouzaglo ’20, the event’s moderator, said the goal of the event was “building strong relations—community relations and personal relations—between the Muslim community on campus and the Jewish community on campus.”
The first portion of the event was a presentation from Director of External Relations of the Harvard Islamic Society Anwar Omeish ’19, which discussed the existence of institutionalized Islamophobia, defined by Omeish as structural discrimination based on race, culture, religion, or identity.
Omeish said her group was engaged in efforts by the recently-launched Anti-Islamophobia Network to combat policies that institutionalize Islamophobia.
“Islamophobia is not [just] interpersonal, it’s also structural,” Omeish said. “It extends into policies, and it has extended into policies before the Trump administration and obviously it’s worse now, but this is something that Muslim people experience.”
The next event brought together three members of the Harvard Islamic Society:  Sahar M. Omer ’20, Tajrean Rahman ’20, and Saim Raza ’19. The panelists spoke about their personal encounters with Islamophobia and support from peers in their hometowns and at Harvard.
The panel also included a question and answer session during which an audience member asked what Harvard can do to help Muslim students feel more comfortable. Omeish and other members of the Harvard Islamic Society said they have met with the Harvard administrators to devise new strategies to support the Muslim students at Harvard.
After the event, Abouzaglo said he hoped the event would foster “strong relations—community relations and personal relations—between the Muslim community on campus and the Jewish community on campus.”
“Right now, I believe that the Jewish community is in a position of great privilege,” Abouzaglo said. “As people who have experienced a history or historic oppression that now that we find ourselves more comfortable specifically in America that we have a moral conscription to stand up and ally with all marginalized groups.”
“For me, the most important allyship of solidarity is with those of fellow religious minorities in America,” Abouzaglo added.

UPDATED: February 17, 2017 at 5:40 p.m. 
A College subcommittee is soliciting feedback on a proposal to replace Harvard’s current housing model with one more similar to Yale’s, in which students do not choose with whom they enter a House.
The potential switch comes in the midst of an administrative effort to “re-center” social life in the Houses. Though still in an exploratory stage, the Residential Subcommittee of  the College-wide group on inclusion and belonging has sought student opinions on the potential move from undergraduate Peer Advising Fellows at two town hall style events.
Brooks B. Lambert-Sluder ’05, who works at the Advising Programs Office and directs the PAF program, said PAFs were chosen by the subcommittee—on which Lambert-Sluder is a “guest”—to provide the initial feedback because “PAFs are really well positioned through their work advising first-year students and building communities in entryways and thinking about the transition from first year to second year, to reflect seriously about this.”
PAFs are assigned in groups to freshman entryways and help advise first-year students on academic and extracurricular matters.
In an email to PAFs before the event, Lambert-Sluder wrote that the town hall would discuss “one particular proposal to strengthen” connections between freshmen and upperclassmen Houses. Lambert-Sluder also circulated two Crimson articles—one detailing previous instances in which the administration considered a switch to Yale’s model, and another urging the adoption of a model closer to Yale’s.
In an interview Tuesday, however, Lambert-Sluder stressed that the possibility of changing Harvard’s current Housing system is “so preliminary that there’s not even a recommendation—this is well before any recommendation stage.”
“I’ve been at Harvard for a long time, and this idea comes up every generation or one-and-a-half generations of College students,” he said. “The College is always trying to figure out if we’re doing things the right way.”
Indeed, the College has often discussed such a switch in recent years.
In a spring 2015 meeting, College administrators and leaders of Harvard’s final clubs discussed the Yale model under “potential College administration-led social initiatives.”
The ideas follow those presented in a 2009 report titled “Report on Harvard House Renewal,” which wrote that a subcommittee discussed a move to Yale’s model. Reports in 2001 and 2004 also considered such a switch.
Lambert-Sluder said that PAFs at the two meetings arrived at no clear consensus about the proposed switch.
“This is quite a broad brush—and I don’t want to claim to represent the 20 or so opinions that were shared specifically—but in general ‘mixed’ is a fair word for [the PAFs’ reactions],” he said.  “I think PAFs thought critically and made really constructive suggestions about strengths and weakness of this particular proposal.”
Lambert-Sluder said there would likely be opportunity for more general student feedback on such a proposal “if and when” it progresses.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 14, 2017 at 3:50 p.m.
Dozens of Cambridge residents attended a City Council meeting Monday, urging the body to create a new “tree task force” in the hopes of mitigating the impact of climate change and encouraging residents to plant more trees.
The policy order creating the task force, which was written by City Councillor Jan Devereux, advocates implementing “more aggressive” efforts to plant trees and requests that City Manager Louis A. DePasquale consult with the Cambridge Department of Public Works, City Arborist David Lefcourt, and other City departments to better protect the city’s “urban canopy.”
“If we have a tree task force and we have a high visibility for that, I think that will reinforce the importance of trees in the public mind,” Devereux said.
That policy order passed unanimously following a minor amendment proposed by Councillor Craig. A Kelley that changed the language of the order to specifically include trees in the focus of the task force. Mayor E. Denise Simmons and Councillor Dennis J. Carlone were added as comakers to the bill following their support.
Also at the meeting, City Councillors passed recommendations by DePasquale to adopt a new Inclusionary Housing Zoning Petition, which looks to increase numbers of affordable and family-sized housing units in some of the city’s large residential developments. The new petition requires newly permitted residential buildings over 30,000 square feet to allocate at least one fifth of their floor space to family units. In the previous recommendation, only developments over 50,000 square feet were held to that requirement.
Carlone aired concerns at the meeting that the changed zoning requirements would not be enforced with developments that had already been granted permits. He said he thought developments with existing permits should also be held to the new one-fifth standard for family housing.
Carlone also asked that a “full schedule list of building construction dates” for multi-building projects impacted by the petition be given to the council to ensure transparency moving forward.
The City Council also moved to its second reading of the Central Square Restoration Zoning Petition, which updates certain zoning requirements in Central Square, requiring establishments selling alcohol and with venues for dancing and socializing be limited to several streets. 
Some residents spoke against the new zoning requirements, with many saying that the areas on the outskirts of the proposed zoning areas were included unintentionally and that the new regulations could inadvertently change rules for some lower-density areas in Cambridge.
After December’s 10-alarm fire in East Cambridge, the Council approved a new zoning ordinance allowing victims of the fire to rebuild their original structures within 24 months, regardless of existing zoning regulations.
At the meeting the Council also granted thousands of dollars in funding to other Cambridge organizations, including Cambridge Community Television, the Cambridge Food Pantry, and community schools for additional bus transportation at Monday’s meeting.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Graduate Council members voted unanimously to “stand as a united body against the polarization affecting this country” in an open letter adopted at the body’s Monday meeting.
In the letter, the Council discusses President Donald Trump’s immigration order without taking an explicit stance on the highly controversial and widely criticized travel restrictions. For almost an hour, Council members debated details of the statement.
“We believe in bridging the divisive nature of this order. We stand for providing safe environments dedicated to equality and due process,” the letter reads.
The letter, which was addressed broadly to Harvard graduate students, notes the executive order’s impact on the Harvard community and asserted the Council’s commitment to students on campus. But at their meeting and in the letter, the Council was cautious not to take a political stance on the topic.
“Irrespective of specific politics, on which we respect the right of every student to his or her own opinion, this body is united as advocates for truth, which includes the values of integrity and justice,” the letter reads.
Trump’s executive order, issued last month, halts immigration from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen for 90 days and suspends entry for Syrian refugees indefinitely.  Multiple federal courts, however, have issued preliminary injunctions to prevent enforcement of part of the order, pending further litigation.  As many as 111 Harvard affiliates come from the listed countries, and at least four Harvard scholars had difficulty entering the United States after Trump signed the order.
The council considered releasing a statement on the immigration order at a previous meeting two weeks ago, but did not take any action at the time.
A key issue during the meeting's discussions was whether the statement would be interpreted as being partisan in nature and whether it was appropriately encompassing of all graduate students’ views. The Council has previously declined to adopt statements on policy issues for this reason.
Council Vice President and Business School representative Simeon Bochev said that members of the Business School’s student association had expressed concerns over the inclusivity of the draft statement.
“At HBS this was a contentious discussion,” Bochev said, “The major concerns regarding the statement came from students who felt their voice was not welcome, not just at Harvard Business School, but at Harvard broadly.  “
“These are people who are not Trump voters or Trump supporters, but people who feel that they aren’t actually included,” said Bochev, “Quite frankly, I also feel sometimes that if I don’t hold a certain view, I’m not respected the same way.”
Natalie Z. Wang, the body’s Chair of Advocacy and Diversity, added that she had received emails from students sympathetic to Trump’s policies who said they were concerned about whether the Council would conflict with their views.
“From my position, I am very happy to be receiving these e-mails,” Wang said, “The reason for that is that they feel comfortable coming to me.  And they see that my position and what we do is something that could acknowledge [their concerns].”
All 11 voting members of the Council present for the meeting, however, ultimately voted in favor of adopting a final version of the open letter.  At the meeting, the Council also unanimously voted to send University President Drew G. Faust a statement requesting additional student involvement in the search for a new Law School dean.

The GSAS Action Network, a graduate student advocacy group, will attend public meetings with members of Congress to discuss labor and environmental policies in the coming weeks, the group decided Monday.
At the Monday meeting, the group, formerly called the Progressive Action Network, also voted to change its name at the meeting, discussing concerns about partisan associations with the word “progressive.” In an email, Dakota McCoy, a graduate student and one of the group’s organizers, described the GSAS Action Network as a“nonpartisan group for social and environmental justice.”
According to McCoy, members generally intend to address “issues of social and environmental justice, things like pipeline construction, renewable energy, labor rights, prison policies” in addition to “issues of race, gender, and women’s rights” when they meet with policy makers.
Some graduate students said that their academic interests influenced their decisions about what they want to tell their representatives.
“I really want to connect with my local politicians,” said Mary K. Salcedo, a graduate student in Organismic and Evolutionary Biology. She said that she intended to speak with her representatives about supporting women and people of color in science.
The group planned two other events to be held in February. On Feb. 21, GSAS Action Network members will co-sponsor an event called “Carving Story out of Expertise” with Society for the Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science. During this event, Dr. Ari D. Shapiro, a journalist who has worked with National Public Radio, will teach graduate students how to communicate their research to the public in clear terms.
On March 5, members will attend a workshop instructing them on how to lobby their representatives for specific reforms.
With these two events already scheduled, members said that it was important for the group’s third event to be focused on advocacy rather than education.
“Those are both very much learning skills workshops and those are very important but I got some feedback that one event should be direct advocacy,” McCoy said.
Members of the group praised these initiatives, stating that they were bringing graduate students from different fields together and allowing the organization to advocate for change.
“As scientists and sociologists and anthropologists and psychologists we’re coming together and supporting initiatives,” Salcedo said. “We’re hoping that if we can actually act, then we can change decisions.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The National Labor Relations Board will consider objections to Harvard’s student unionization  election at a hearing Feb. 22 and deliberate over whether or not to call for a re-vote on the issue.
Graduate union student organizers filed an objection to the November election in December, arguing that the University did not provide complete and accurate lists of eligible voters for the vote. The University also filed a much more limited objection to the election.
The NLRB had already scheduled a hearing to discuss the election because of its close results. In an initial vote count, 1,272 voters supported unionization while 1,456 opposed it, while 314 ballots remain under challenge because of disputes about the voters’ eligibility.
Because the vote margin remains smaller than the number of challenged ballots, the election deciding whether undergraduate teaching assistants and graduate student research assistants and teaching assistants can form a union remains too close too call. The NLRB will discuss both the objections and the challenged ballots at the Feb. 22 hearing.
In an order announcing the hearing’s date and agenda, NLRB Regional Director John J. Walsh Jr.  wrote that “the Challenged Ballots and Objections raise substantial and material factual issues that may be best resolved by hearing.”
If Walsh finds that the union organizers’ objections are valid, he could call for a re-vote.
In its objection, the Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Auto Workers argued the NLRB should not count the results of the election and should instead hold a re-vote.
The union organizers wrote that the lists of eligible voters that Harvard provided before the elections—referred to as Excelsior lists—were incomplete and contained students’ “preferred names” instead of legal names. The union charged that some students on the list were unable to vote because their legal names on their IDs did not match the names on voter lists.
The union contended that these flaws with the list of eligible voters warrant a re-vote.
“Because the Employer's failure to substantially comply with the Excelsior requirements could have affected the outcome of the election, the direction of a second election is warranted,” lawyers representing the union wrote.
While the objection filed by the Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Auto Workers takes issue with the conduct of the election more broadly, Harvard’s argument is more narrow. In its objection, Harvard contends that the NLRB improperly declared one ballot void because it contained a written note addressed to the vote counter.
“Because the voter’s intention was clear (having placed a large black “X” in the “No” box), the voided ballot should be counted in overall tally,” lawyers representing the University wrote.
For union organizers, the NLRB’s decision to consider the objections was encouraging.
“We’re thrilled to advance to the next step on the way to a fair, democratic election here at Harvard,” said Andrew Donnelly, a graduate student and union organizer. “We totally anticipate that the law is on our side here. Harvard made a completely defective list. We were anticipating this result and we’re thrilled to move onto the next step.”
Paul R. Curran, director of Labor and Employee Relations, wrote in a statement that Harvard’s lists were as accurate as possible.
“The University carefully, in good faith, and in cooperation with the HGSU-UAW produced a list of eligible voters based on the union’s description of the bargaining unit,” he wrote. “And, prior to the election, the University directly and immediately responded to union concerns about the list.”
Some graduate students who oppose unionization are calling on the NLRB not to conduct a re-vote. In a letter to Walsh, group of 14 graduate students defended the conduct of the November election. Jae Hyeon Lee, a graduate student who signed the letter, called the election “fair.”
“As Harvard admitted in resolving many of the challenged votes, [the Excelsior list] was not complete in the sense that it did not get every voter right, it did not include every possible eligible voter in the list, but I don’t think it’s a fair standard to judge whether the election was conducted fairly or not,” he said.
By the time the NRLB conducts its hearing later this month, it will have been more than three months since students first went to the polls.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 14, 2017, at 4:21 a.m.
BOSTON — Close down the monopoly on Commonwealth Avenue. Because for the first time in 24 years, the Beanpot belongs to the Harvard Crimson.
Prior to Monday’s clash of the two best men's hockey teams that the East Coast has to offer, either Boston University or Boston College had won every Beanpot since Harvard last celebrated on Garden ice back in 1993. But playing in its first tournament championship game in nearly a decade, the No. 3 Crimson outshot the No. 4 Terriers by a whopping 46-17 margin en route to a historic 6-3 victory Monday night over the 30-time champions at TD Garden.
“Our group felt like it was their night, and they were willing to make sure it was their night," Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “I’m very proud of the group. It’s been a long time coming, and I’m very happy for these guys.”
“So much work went into this game, into building this team that we have,” co-captain Devin Tringale said. “[The Beanpot] has been something we’ve wanted for a long time, so for it to happen, it’s awesome.”
Freshman forward Nathan Krusko, named the Most Valuable Player of the tournament, netted two go-ahead goals for Harvard—one in the first and one in the second. The latter gave the Crimson a 3-2 edge with 1:06 remaining in the second period, and Harvard never looked back.

Less than two minutes of game time later, co-captain Alexander Kerfoot punched home the Crimson’s fourth goal, which ultimately proved to be the winner. But sophomore Ryan Donato still had an exclamation point to provide.
Playing in perhaps his future home, the Boston Bruins draft selection came up with a steal at the attacking blue line, darted to the right wing, and then danced back towards the slot. And then he fired away.
The puck slid right by freshman goaltender Jake Oettinger, giving the Crimson a 5-2 edge with 7:13 to go. Up shot the arms of the sophomore, just as everyone in the building, including a Harvard student section no less, began to realize what might be in store.
“It was a big goal,” Ted Donato said. “I don’t think any of the goals tonight I would characterize as anything but. But that made the light at the end of the tunnel a little brighter.”
The Terriers did offer a quick response courtesy of star freshman Clayton Keller, who scored twice in the game. But in a period in which BU managed only seven shots, the lead had proven insurmountable. Freshman defenseman Adam Fox provided the game's final score—an empty-netter heaved the length of the ice—with 1:50 left to play.
“This is a game of want and desire, and you’ve got to do it for 60 minutes,” BU coach David Quinn said. “You can’t all of a sudden elevate your want and desire when you have the puck.”
“Really disappointing, really a head-scratcher in a lot of ways,” Quinn added. “I don’t know if we thought we were just going to be able to show up and win because we had beaten them before…. I don’t know. I’ve got to find out, that’s for sure.”
Quinn was left to scratch his head right from the start, as the Terriers took three penalties in the opening frame and were outshot, 18-2. But the Crimson only managed to break through once on a 5-on-3, allowing BU to show its first sign of life at the outset of the second period.
In fact, the Terriers logged as many goals in the second as they had shots in the first. Skating on its first power play of the night, BU evened the score just 1:29 into the period. Junior Brandon Hickey delivered a slap-pass into the slot, sophomore Bobo Carpenter threw the puck on net, and freshman Kieffer Bellows punched home the rebound that knotted things at one.
Stationed in front of Harvard netminder Merrick Madsen less than three minutes later, Keller tipped in a blue-line blast from junior defenseman John MacLeod to hand the Crimson its first deficit of the tournament.
Just as BU was beginning to take control of the contest, however, the Crimson’s Luke Esposito matched Keller with a tip of his own. With his back to the goal midway through the period, the senior second-liner deflected just enough of a point shot from classmate Clay Anderson to send the puck flying past Oettinger.
And from then on, it was all Harvard.
“BU made some plays to start the second, but I really liked the attitude and the answer on the bench,” Ted Donato said. “I thought we were relentless all night. Our guys just kept coming, and our best players I thought were just immense.”
Spotting a loose puck by the bottom of the right circle with the second period winding down, freshman defenseman John Marino spun around to set-up Krusko's second tally with a feed towards the crease. The puck skipped off the left skate of freshman Dante Fabbro towards Krusko, who reached to his backhand to lift the go-ahead goal right into the cage.
The Crimson would immediately jump on the power play upon the ensuing faceoff thanks to a Fabbro hook, and before period’s end, sophomore defenseman Charlie McAvoy took his second shorthanded penalty of the night to put Harvard up 5-on-3 for more than a minute.
But the Crimson would only need 53 seconds. Right at the start of the third, senior Tyler Moy threw a pass through the crease to a lurking Kerfoot. Oettinger sprung to his left to make the save of the night with his pad, but the Harvard co-captain kept poking at the puck until it finally trickled through.
Kerfoot’s goal brought about the first multiple-goal edge for either side. And for both the Crimson and its co-captain, the backbone of a senior class playing in its eighth Beanpot game but just its first nightcap, that was enough of a cushion to ride to the finish.
“I think it was something they really wanted,” said Ted Donato about his seniors. “They wanted to leave this kind of legacy that they were a group that was going to break the curse.”
GAME NOTES
—The Crimson finished 2-for-5 on the power play Monday night, with both conversions coming on 5-on-3. BU defenseman Charlie McAvoy, a Boston Bruins prospect, took both penalties that produced the two-man advantages. One was a Bruin-on-Bruin board of Ryan Donato in the first period that helped set up Krusko’s first goal of the night.
—Five different Harvard skaters finished with multiple points on the night. Tyler Moy, Sean Malone, and Clay Anderson all logged two assists; Adam Fox netted a goal and an assist; and tournament MVP Nathan Krusko recorded two goals and an assist.
—With the win, Harvard moves into third in the PairWise rankings. BU slips to fifth.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Monday night, something happened for the first time in 24 years. The Harvard men’s hockey team captured its first Beanpot title since 1993 after doubling up Boston University, 6-3, at TD Garden. When the Crimson last accomplished this feat, only one member of the current team, Phil Zielonka, was even alive. And he was less than two weeks old.
The Beanpot finale, as is usually the case, was further enhanced by the decorated history between these two local foes. The 154 games played between the Crimson and the Terriers date back to 1922, and less than two miles rink-to-rink separate BU (19-9-2, 11-5-2 Hockey East) and Harvard (18-5-2, 12-4-2 ECAC), making the two schools the closest Division I hockey programs geographically.
SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS
When the horn sounded after 20 minutes, Harvard owned a startling 18-2 lead in shots on goal. Three BU penalties, two of which led to a 5-on-3 that resulted in the Crimson’s first goal, noticeably skewed the shot numbers in the game’s beginning third. Four Harvard skaters each notched at least as many shots as the entire Terriers team in the first period.
Although BU has conceded fewer shots, 281, in the first frame than in either of the later two periods this season, the Crimson’s 18 shots before the first intermission matched the second-most opening period attempts it’s had during its current campaign. An early January matchup against Princeton featured 20 shots on goal from Harvard in period one.
“[Harvard] had the puck a lot,” BU coach David Quinn said. “We were slow, the puck movement was slow—and the skating. Really disappointing.”
The Crimson’s domination on both sides of the ice helped tie its largest first-period shot differential of the season. Defensively, Harvard’s blue line kept the Terriers’ attack efforts away from the high-scoring areas, as neither of BU’s shots in the period came inside the faceoff circles.
On the offensive end, the Crimson’s flurry of shots in the opening frame set the tone for a game-long peppering of BU freshman netminder Jake Oettinger. Harvard’s 46 shots on the evening stand as its second-highest total this season.
In such a crucial game, the Terriers allowed over 40 shots on goal for the first time all year, falling to 5-10-2 under Quinn when conceding this sum. Furthermore, Monday’s duel marks just the second time the opposition has limited BU to fewer than 20 shots during the 2016-2017 campaign.
“We definitely emphasized getting shots to the net, but I think that just goes to show our style of play and how we were playing tonight,” co-captain Alex Kerfoot said. “We had a lot of offensive zone pressure and generated a lot of opportunities up and down the lineup.”
The Terriers went on to double their shot attempts in the first 90 seconds of the middle frame and shortly thereafter converted on the man-advantage to tie the game; another goal followed mere minutes later.
“[Harvard] is deep, they’re good, they’re well coached,” Quinn remarked. “Right from the get-go, we were chasing the pace of the play. And then the second period started and we had pace, and we had some chances and some offensive zone time.”
WELL DONE, YOUNG BLOOD
All three Terrier goals came from the sticks of freshmen on Monday night, with Clayton Keller and Kieffer Bellows bulging the twine behind Crimson goalie Merrick Madsen. These performances helped BU tilt the ice back toward neutral for parts of the game, particularly in the second period.
“We knew BU was going to keep coming,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “[The Terriers] have so many talented guys and so many playmakers.”
BU has the youngest roster in the country this season—the average age being 20 years and five months—and freshmen account for 104 of the team’s 245 points to date. Combined with the sophomores, the Terrier puppies are responsible for 82 percent of BU’s scoring this year.
Specifically, Keller, who saw his 15-game scoring streak come to an end on Friday against UMass Lowell, leads his team in goals and points. The seventh overall pick in last year’s NHL Draft also sets the pace among all college freshmen with 1.45 points per game.
The Terriers’ high-flying youth contrasts harshly with how the Crimson’s scoring breaks down: Harvard seniors have combined for the most points of any graduating class in the NCAA this season, currently with 133.
BU’s underclassmen, however, do more than simply score: rookie netminder Jake Oettinger, who, on Monday night, made a season-high 40 saves but allowed a season-worst five goals, is the second-youngest player in Division I hockey. In October, the winner of this year’s Eberly Trophy—given to the goaltender with the best save percentage in the Beanpot—made his first career start for the Terriers at the ripe age of 17.
POWER UP
While Harvard potted four goals at even strength including an empty-netter, the Crimson also victimized the Terriers on the power play, converting twice in crucial moments on the man-advantage. BU sophomore defenseman Charlie McAvoy was responsible both times for sending his team two-men down.
Harvard boasts the fifth-best power play percentage in the country at 26.2 percent, a significant contributor to its +43 goal margin, good for second in Division I. Giving the Crimson five man-up attempts—in particular, two lengthy two-man advantages—was perhaps the Terriers’ greatest lapse on Monday night. Harvard cashed in on both of these opportunities thanks to Kerfoot and Beanpot MVP Nathan Krusko.
Both Crimson forwards have six power play goals apiece to date, and because of his prominent role on his team’s second power play unit, Krusko enjoys a high-quality shot selection that has led to a team-best .195 goals per shot on goal rate.
BU’s untimely penalties snuffed any rally it was trying to stage in the second frame. Having conceded a late-period goal—Krusko’s second of the night—the Terriers squandered any chance of a pushback, as they returned to the kill after two stick infractions.
“Not only did we go down [3-2 at the end of the second]…we’re killing a five-on-three,” said Quinn. “So you can imagine what was going on in [the Harvard players’] heads in between the second and third periods.”
The Terriers entered the tournament finale with the NCAA’s fourth-best penalty kill at 87.1 percent and even survived 22 straight opponent power plays earlier in the season. This sturdy shorthanded unit was bound to cave, however, under the constant zone time and pressure from the Crimson attack.
