The Tony-winning musical “Kinky Boots,” currently running on Broadway, has received both critical and popular acclaim as a progressive show that promotes the acceptance of gender-nonconforming characters. However, the musical only engages with bigotry on a superficial level and fails to address the main character’s ingrained prejudices in a meaningful way.
The story centers around a cisgender man, Charlie Price, who forms a business partnership with Lola the drag queen in a last-ditch attempt to save his family’s shoe factory. Together, Charlie and Lola manufacture a line of boots which combines the flashy designs typically marketed to cisgender women with heels strong enough to support the build of transgender women.
For most of the show, Charlie comes across as ignorant but not ill-intentioned. He clearly does not understand cross-dressing, referring to drag queens as “trans-vet-erans” immediately after having learned the connotational difference between “transvestite” and “drag queen.” Yet overall, he is civil and generally polite to Lola. He uses female pronouns without comment and is willingly vulnerable with her about his past, showing a level of trust and respect that indicates an acceptance of Lola as a person.
Until, that is, Charlie is behind schedule.
During the factory’s push to finish their new line of boots in time for a fashion show in Milan, a stressed-out Charlie radically switches tactics, electing to have cisgender women model the shoes instead of drag queens to avoid “embarrassing the name of Price & Son by parading a planeload of misfits.” He tells an outraged Lola, “Once the industry sees your work, you’ll be able to stop all this and have a normal life.” The derogatory qualifier of “normal” reveals that Charlie believes cross-dressing is anything but. When Lola calls him a fool, Charlie shoots back, “I’d wager if we stood side by side and asked passersby which one of us is fooling himself, most of the votes would swing your way.” He continues: “You’re a joke. You think you’re being all mystical and deep representin’ the best of both sexes, but I’m here to tell you all you are is daft. You say you want to be treated like a man; then start acting like one.” And then, the final nail in the coffin: “I’m sorry, but sometimes the truth hurts.” Wounded and furious, Lola leaves the factory, soon followed by the rest of the workers.
Charlie’s arrogant, offensive, and close-minded outburst does not undermine the integrity of the musical — far from it, in fact. On the contrary, this scene startlingly establishes that Charlie’s awkwardness around Lola throughout the show was not simply a result of unfamiliarity, as it had previously seemed, but rather a sign of deeply rooted biases.
For the purposes of the musical, this in and of itself is not a problem. The fact that Charlie is portrayed so positively before his prejudices are exposed may even make the message more powerful. This seemingly jarring change forces viewers to realize that an outwardly likable character can be just as bigoted as an abrasive and openly hostile one. As a candid exploration of prejudices and of how a character genuinely overcomes them, the musical could have engaged with audience members of all viewpoints rather than merely those who already share the writers’ opinions. Especially with the potentially schmaltzy message of acceptance at the core of “Kinky Boots,” this approach could have been very effective for reaching viewers less familiar with or supportive of different gender identities, without conveying malice or condescension.
Unfortunately, the musical takes a different route. Seemingly unbothered by Charlie’s disparagement of Lola, his employees do not request an apology before they forgive him, even tearing up their paychecks to fund the company’s final effort. And worse still, Lola returns to save the business just a few scenes later. For Lola, an apology via voicemail seems to be enough to redeem Charlie’s cutting insults.
In glossing over Charlie’s prejudices regarding gender norms — which, if they have not changed in his weeks of working with Lola, could not have fundamentally changed in the days between his attack and their reconciliation — “Kinky Boots” contradicts the very message of acceptance that it claims to promote. The musical’s oversimplified resolution suggests that having prejudices is not intrinsically bad, so long as they remain internalized. The token progressiveness of “Kinky Boots” masks the show’s blind eye to the subtler, far more prevalent form of bigotry displayed by the main character, a bigotry which, if unconscious and internalized, is very real.
The intent of the creative team of “Kinky Boots” — to represent a community rarely given a respectful spotlight in theater — is admirable, and I am sure that they meant no harm by the musical’s ending. However, when addressing such complex subject matters, they and future writers must carefully consider every implication of the plot. Especially in a professedly progressive story such as “Kinky Boots,” it is vital to resist hasty, predictable happy endings that, though emotionally satisfying on the surface, downplay the real difficulties of the themes involved.

“Winnie-the-Pooh: Exploring a Classic” opened its doors on Sept. 22, inviting the public to engage with almost 200 artifacts and sketches of author-illustrator pair A. A. Milne and E. H. Shepard. The gallery tells the story of their partnership and inspirations, particularly Milne’s son Christopher Robin Milne and his teddy bear named Pooh. As an interactive and exceptionally child-friendly space, it urges adults and kids alike to immerse in their surroundings.
The exhibit opens with a space reminiscent of a nursery. The walls are white with light blue stripes, displaying photos of the Milne family. “We Are Introduced,” reads the wall plaque, which details Christopher Robin Milne’s life in Chelsea, London, and their weekend trips to Ashdown Forest — the inspiration for Pooh’s make-believe home, the Hundred Acre Wood. In an adjacent “nursery” room sits a little bed, a reproduction of Christopher Robin Milne’s, with his favorite toys nearby: Eeyore, Pooh, Piglet, Kanga, and Tigger. Hanging on the wall beside them is a glass-plated letter from A. A. Milne to Shepard. It reads, “I think you must come here on Thursday, if only to get Pooh’s and Piglet’s likeness.” The viewer is steeped in this little boy’s world, which his father so fostered and expanded by way of bedtime stories and the books they inspired.
Then the gallery takes a turn. Without being overtly educational, the environment encourages kids to interact. In the next room, viewers are invited to crawl through a short door, over which a sign reads “MR. SANDERS.” Suddenly, it’s Pooh’s home! All at once, the room becomes a highly interactive space filled with games and activities directed at a young audience. The sound of rain plays through the speakers, reminiscent of the film clip “Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day.” Kids thunder, skipping across a Poohsticks bridge. There is a slide, and a Hunny dining table where kids can sit and sketch.
It’s loud, exciting, and stimulating, and this emphasis on interplay — and play itself — is no accident. Wall text abounds with descriptions of collaboration between the Milne-Shepard families, as well as the subtlety of “Winnie-the-Pooh’s” educational agenda.
“Milne reveals the characters rather than describing them,” one wall reads. “We come to know them gradually through their conversations and adventures.”
The gallery’s thematic focus on interplay results in a provocative, exciting experience, as viewers are encouraged not to glide through galleries passively, but rather to make some noise, draw some connections, learn something new by tapping into their inner child. No matter what age, visitors to the gallery won’t help but walk over the Poohsticks bridge.

“40 years ago, on Halloween night, Michael Myers murdered three people,” Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) says. The old Michael Myers was an amateur.  Now, in David Gordon Green’s “Halloween,” the silent killer is back, deadlier and scarier than ever. Not only does the film successfully reboot a series that has suffered for years from a series of lackluster entries, but it also stands on its own as being one of the better horror movies to be released in several years.
Ignoring the nine sequels and two attempted reboots, “Halloween” (2018) serves as a direct sequel to the original 1978 film. In 1978, following his murder of three teenagers on Halloween night, Michael Myers (the serial killer, not the comedian) was apprehended and imprisoned in a mental institution, where he has remained for 40 years. Laurie Strode, the only teenager to have battled Michael and escaped, has been traumatized by her experience and has spent decades preparing herself and her family for the day that he might return. While being transported to another institution, the prison transport bus crashes, and Michael Myers arrives back in his hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois for a final confrontation with Laurie Strode.
There are a lot of things that this iteration of “Halloween” does correctly. Be it the likable main characters, the similarities between this film and the 1978 original, some excellent cinematic shots, or John Carpenter’s original haunting theme music, there is a lot to keep you invested. However, as a horror movie, there is one thing that is critical to a film’s efficacy: the feeling of fear and dread. For the first time in a long time, this film nails it. From the second Michael Myers arrives back in Haddonfield, each scene is packed with tension and suspense, for he could be around any corner, standing in any shadow, or hiding in any room. Additionally, there is no doubt as to what Michael Myers’ intentions are. If he catches someone, they are dead. Michael’s constant presence and inescapable intentions, make for some incredible moments in the film, especially during the exciting, heart-pounding finale.
The brilliance of the Michael Myers character exacerbates this fear. He is one of the most menacing horror movie villains, and his scariest features are the ones that are emphasized the most in this new adaptation. His classic Halloween mask is now dirty, more ragged, and scarred, much like the character himself. He remains as silent as ever, his breathing being one of the few indicators of his presence. And perhaps most effectively, he never rapidly pursues his victims. He walks at a calm pace, never in a hurry to catch them. Yet almost certainly, he will.
Still, despite the iconic nature of Michael Myers, he is only one of several amazing characters that bring the film to life. An unexpected gem is Julian (Jibrail Nantambu), a small boy that is being babysat in a house that Michael invades. Nantambu is hilarious in the role and steals every scene he is in. However, the real star of the show is Jamie Lee Curtis reprising her role of Laurie Strode. Curtis is a phenomenal actress who perfectly encapsulates the character for which she has now become famous. Curtis’ ability to paint Laurie Strode as a strong, capable fighter while simultaneously highlighting her weaknesses and instabilities breathes life into the character.
Another strong feature of “Halloween” is its ability to thematically refer back to the original 1978 version while also differentiating itself and providing a new, unique take on the story. Many moments are direct call-backs to the original, including a nearly identical title sequence, which should thrill fans of the older film. However, knowledge of the original is not required to make this an enjoyable experience. While John Carpenter’s original, iconic theme is used to great effect, it is used infrequently in its original form, with different variations of it appearing throughout the film. Finally, and most interestingly, the dynamic between Laurie Strode and Michael Myers is completely flipped. Whereas in 1978 Laurie was the clear victim, in 2018, the lines are blurred. As Laurie thematically transitions from the hunted to the hunter, it becomes unclear who should be afraid of whom. It is thrilling to watch that dynamic play out during the course of the narrative.
Additionally, the cinematography strategically escalates the tension and fear by often focusing on what is happening offscreen, rather than on it. Few of the deaths happen onscreen, with the camera angled to miss the killing blow. The brutality and fear are still conveyed, as the camera focuses on the knife plunging over and over, but we miss the unnecessary gore that often accompanies it in similar films. Furthermore, when the camera does show the killing blow, it is shocking and highly effective. A truly impressive long-take is also used when Michael first returns to Haddonfield to begin his new killing spree. Watching his slow, methodical process begin over the course of several minutes with no cuts works well at highlighting the efficacy of his techniques as well as his robotic and unstoppable nature.
That being said, not everything about the film is great. The beginning gets off to a bit of a rocky start, with some clunky exposition and a bit of a ridiculous premise. Green spends a lot of time introducing characters, many of whom aren’t particularly interesting. Furthermore, the introduction of additional villains serves only to bog down the narrative and distract from the engrossing and horrifying phenomenon that is Michael Myers.
However, overlooking some of the film’s flaws, “Halloween” is a strong new entry in what was a tired series. With a frightening villain, interesting main characters, and a feeling of dread that pervades the entire film once Michael Myers returns, the new film reminds us, “There’s a reason we’re supposed to be afraid of [Halloween] night.”

Harvard — the pinnacle of academic success. If you’re here, you’ve made it; if you’re not, you yearn to be. It’s a place where doors fly open and dreams come true. Companies are born, startups take off, and just the emblazoned crimson-colored “H” alone can land a job at any top law, financial, or consulting firm. It’s easy to become lost in it all — at a place made up of only the best, the pressure to succeed is immense.
The extracurriculars, the 4.0 GPA, the fancy summer internship at J.P. Morgan Chase or our local senator’s office — it’s what we all aim for. Throw in trying to have a social life in a social hierarchy dominated by final clubs, and it quickly becomes a sprint to check off the boxes of being the “perfect” Harvard student.
Now put 7,000 undergraduates together all competing for the same thing, and the picture becomes a bit less glamorous: trying to outlast peers at 3:18 AM in Lamont, furiously handing out business cards with plastered-on rehearsed smiles and freshly dry-cleaned suits at a networking event, or kicking ourselves because our roommate — who seems to be better than us at everything — managed to snag four points higher on the last midterm. It’s not a sustainable  — nor healthy — lifestyle.
At Harvard, we’re taught that we must be “on” all the time, always at our best, always projecting confidence, and always know the answer. There is somehow shame if we don’t. We’re trained not to let our guard down. Much of this we do to ourselves. Every lunchtime conversation is a discussion about careers, courses, and theses. We count how many times we can drop the word “apropos” in a conversation, or use “an historic” to sound like an academic. It’s a place where we can always find someone better than us at virtually anything, and resultantly, we all try to live “Facebook lifestyles” — sharing only the good and concealing our shortcomings, trying to project a hollow image of confidence, perfection, and unwavering ability.
As I’ve come to learn as of late, perfection doesn’t exist. We’re all only human. In constantly comparing ourselves to other high-achievers in a cutthroat academic and social culture, we create an environment in which our sense of self-worth is chalked up to a GPA and the length of our resume. We all feel it day in and day out; but nobody ever talks about it.
In this type of atmosphere, we’re force-fed a completely ludicrous definition of what “success” is, which we have proliferated ourselves through this culture. To be successful, we have to graduate and land “the job” — making six figures within the first couple years. We want the Cape house, the fancy car, and to fly only first-class while sipping whisky with our pinky outstretched in the air like Spongebob. We base our happiness on this ill-rooted metric of what we collectively agree “success” is, and any failure to reach this cookie-cutter aspiration diminishes our self worth even more.
It’s the reason we question, “Why am I here? Did Harvard make a mistake?” It’s why we all feel like we’re never good enough, and envy our friends/peers who outwardly appear to have it all together. It eats away at our sense of value like an angry sea eroding cliffs until they topple. And it’s why we sit miserably for months or years debating whether or not we should talk with anyone about this. Trust me — you’re not alone. A quick stop by HUHS and realizing you recognize everyone in the waiting room shows there are more people in this boat than you think.
Success is not measurable in dollars. It’s not proportional to the number of square feet of our house, nor the height at which our office sits in a shiny city skyscraper. Success is not a number printed on our transcript, and it certainly isn’t the how many LinkedIn connections we’ve made.
The only “success” worth pursuing is being happy. It’s about the people you meet, the memories you make, and the laughs you share with those you care about the most. It’s not sitting in the basement of the Science Center on a Thursday night cramming to score three points percent on a midterm. It’s sneaking to the Science Center roof at midnight with someone you’re close to, uncorking a bottle of wine, and watching a meteor shower together.
We can’t all be the CEO of Goldman Sachs or a Supreme Court Justice, and that’s perfectly alright. We can’t all fight for the same thing just because that’s what we believe success is. Not everyone can be the “best” at that.
Rather, we each have our own unique combination of gifts; no two people have quite the same combination. It’s how we carve out our own niche and do what we love with said combination that we can become the best at. We’re all the best at different things. Embrace it.
Being away from Harvard this fall has allowed me to escape “the bubble” and see clearly. I want my peers to all know that we are good enough; we are successful, and what we’re taught “success” is doesn’t matter at all.
Sometimes, put the problem set on hold. Give the essay only 100 percent effort instead of 500 percent. Take a moment to look up at the sky. Share dinner and drinks with close friends. Go and watch the sunrise bathe Harvard Yard in an amber-colored light. Do something that makes you smile. At the end of the day, these are the moments that matter.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Like many students at the College, I recently received an email from my (wonderful) resident dean letting my House know that selling our tickets to the Harvard-Yale football game to other students violates the Athletic Department’s policy. The Winthrop House resident dean reportedly threatened to refer to the Office of Academic Integrity and Student Conduct anyone who attempts to sell their ticket — an especially common practice this year, when “The Game” will be at relatively faraway Fenway Park, which, unlike Harvard Stadium, enforces strict seating rules.
As long as students stop selling on administrator-accessible House email lists, I don’t know how or if the College intends to enforce this policy. Gifting tickets is apparently still allowed, so it’s not like Fenway could just check every student’s ID. (And if they tried, well, this is an event where students stampeded through the metal detectors last year). But we should all resent the idea that Harvard undergraduates should not be allowed to decide what to do with their ticket. Lower-income students, in particular, deserve the choice between going to a football game and getting over $100.
It’s not just that this iteration of The Game promises to be less convenient and less socially fulfilling. It’s that some students genuinely have little interest in athletics, and attending an hours-long event outdoors in late November is not their cup of tea. On the other hand, some of their classmates have friends who want to attend The Game despite not being current Harvard undergraduates.
Supposedly, the ban on selling tickets supports “community” and “school spirit” (in the words of the resident deans), but as with every policy, we should evaluate it based on consequences, not intentions. If the less-interested aren’t allowed to sell, literally everyone involved loses, including on metrics like “community” and “school spirit.” The uninterested, like Maxwell K. Ho ’21, can no longer exchange their ticket for the cash to fund a meal with their friends, and the buyers can’t bring their friends to The Game. The rule even costs anyone at The Game who would prefer a positive, energetic crowd: Without sale, the seats in Fenway would either be filled with less enthusiastic spectators or remain empty, while the would-be attendees sit at home. It doesn’t take a supply-and-demand graph to see how allowing students to sell their tickets, rather than making them either give them away or reluctantly attend, would result in more of these beneficial trades.
Yes, this petty prohibition seems like a trivial problem, especially given the difficulty enforcing it. But it is a useful exercise in seeing how moralistic interventions in markets can be regressive and counterproductive on their own criteria.
And another intervention — this one mandated by Uncle Sam — could have more serious consequences.
In prior years, the barriers between the pre-drinking and game-watching sections of the typical undergraduate’s Game day have been a few hundred yards (and, in theory, a metal detector). Administrators turn a blind eye to the massive underage alcohol consumption, so students tailgate until they’re comfortably numb, stop, and find their seats a few minutes later. Now, those barriers have multiplied, and that’s partly Harvard’s own making.
When students who want to be drunk for any event — formals, parties in the Quad, or The Game — know in advance that they will not be able to drink there, the solution is obvious: Drink much, much more before they leave their rooms. And, of course, how much they need to drink depends on how far in the future that event is.
So, you do the math: You’re a sophomore or junior below the drinking age. You live a 15-minute walk from the Science Center Plaza, where the College-sponsored tailgate — er, “Harvard-Yale On-Campus Student Gathering” — will take place. You know that alcohol will only be served in a “21+ bar monitored by [Student Events Services] staff,” but you want to check out the “Gathering” for a while, and then board the shuttle from Memorial Hall to Fenway—which will take 15 to 20 minutes. The Game will start at 12 p.m. and last for two hours. How much alcohol should you drink in your room by 10:30 a.m.?
Now, try solving that problem at 10:15 a.m., when you’ve already had three shots!
For that reason, given the foolishness of the drinking age in the context of college, this year’s Game was probably doomed to result in more binge-drinking, vomiting, and hospitalizations from the moment it was moved to Fenway. The question, then, is: How do we let people drink as close to kickoff as possible, despite that logistical challenge?
I grant that we probably could not serve alcohol to the underaged at an official, centralized tailgate with staff present. But then why not move the tailgate to its usual home around Harvard Stadium and let student groups and House Committees provide the refreshments? That would not only give a bit of plausible deniability but also shave several minutes off the shuttle ride. (That area is also much larger than the Science Center Plaza and the tiny Ipswich Lot by Fenway, the site of another College-sponsored tailgate.) It wouldn’t fix the problem entirely, but I would predict that by giving students a shorter delay and encouraging lower-percentage drinks, we could save a lot of ambulance miles.
This year’s Game presented special challenges to administrators, but students have found their own solutions: After all, they know their own preferences for different experiences far better than administrators. They will act accordingly to circumvent the rules where they can, often foiling the best-intentioned plans. I hope my future-policy-making peers, who currently find themselves on the side facing these policies, consider parallels when the tables are turned and the stakes are greater.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh released his “Resilient Boston Harbor” plan to protect Boston from the impending effects of climate change. The plan draws heavily from the city’s climate action plan, Imagine Boston 2030 and a series of 2070 flood maps, signaling a strong movement towards adaptation-minded efforts. Though Resilient Boston is a potentially costly project, the plan is an important series of initiatives that will begin to address the climate impacts we see today and those of future generations.
Climate change is real. We see the effects of a fluctuating climate every day—from increased severity in storms, to changing weather patterns, to elevated indices for wildfire. In Boston, the effects of climate change are expected to manifest as sea levels rise and stormwaters flood the area. The degree to which governments are able to curb their greenhouse gas emissions in the near future will predict the extent to which preparation for climate change is necessary. We applaud Boston for being proactive in producing a plan to address the changes to our climate that we know are coming.
In conjunction with the City’s mitigation goals, the resilience efforts promoted in the plan present a good starting point. They address the localized effects of climate change in a manner that is both effective and productive for maintaining and ameliorating Boston residents’ quality of life.
However, while we commend Boston for its efforts, we believe the city can do even better going forward. Importantly, climate science is an extremely dynamic field that changes every day. Therefore, while the initiatives offered by the plan address the projected effects of climate change we can predict now, we hope this document can be easily amended to future developments within the field.
We also hope that Boston will continue to prioritize equity as a chief concern in its climate planning. Though climate change will affect everyone, it is proven to have differential effects on groups of income levels, ages, races, and other identity factors. As Boston pioneers a more resilient future, we hope that the City will not only consider the most vulnerable populations in their climate planning efforts, but also foreground them.
Additionally, although the Resilient Boston Harbor initiative was outlined by the City of Boston, we believe Harvard should also play a large role in climate planning efforts. Climate change will affect every facet of human society, and it is a responsibility of the University, and other private and public institutions across the Boston area, to aid in climate planning efforts. Harvard already has an ambitious climate action plan, however, it is largely centered on mitigation efforts to stem the University’s direct effect on greenhouse gas emissions.
The University, as one of the richest and most influential institutions in the world, should not only devote itself to climate science, but also to adaptation planning. Harvard is a central part of the Boston-Cambridge community and cannot ignore its impact on the surrounding community. Therefore, it should actively aid, both financially and in terms of planning, resilience efforts initiated in the area. While this will require both intellectual and fiscal resources, it is important to note that Harvard’s sustained preeminence is contingent upon a world that does not fall prey to climate change at large.
We commend Boston’s efforts in creating a community more resilient to climate change as outlined by the Resilient Boston Harbor Plan. However, we urge the City to prioritize the most vulnerable communities in the area in its planning efforts, both as the plan stands now, and as it develops. We further call on Harvard to play a more active role than just producing scholarship and enacting its mitigation plan by taking the lead as a university institution envisioning adaptation as an integral component to its sustained operations.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Prime Minister of New Zealand Bill English took up residency at the Institute of Politics as a visiting fellow this week — and bestowed some wisdom from the other side of the globe.
Leading a study group session called “Tales from Politics Down Under and Data Driven Reform,” the former politician shared his insights on social policy with Harvard affiliates.
English’s visit was part of a larger effort by the IOP to encourage students to pursue public service by bringing world leaders to Harvard, according to a press release.
English served as prime minister of the island country from 2016 until he stepped down earlier this year. English also served as the Minister of Finance from 2008 to 2016. English brought his wealth of experience to multiple discussions with Harvard students over his three day visit, focusing primarily on the unique methods his government used to craft New Zealand’s social policy.
“When we were in government, we implemented a sort of large-scale data-driven social policy, and we actually turned it into day-to-day operation,” English said in an interview with The Crimson. “I’ve been able to talk about it here with people who’ve thought about it thoroughly and have good healthy academic skepticism. So, it’s a good test of ideas.”
Implementing a data-driven social policy program in the United States would be difficult, English said — but not impossible. “Using integrated data in government is technologically challenging but doable, and we’ve been changing the ways the systems work around that," he said.
“Quite a number of people are interested in what we do and how we do it, even if it’s hard to do here, because it does allow you to provide the right services to the right people,” he added.
In an interview, English said that his time at the Kennedy School introduced him to new perspectives.
“I’ve got six children, and across the age group, 18 to 30. So I’ve heard most things young people can come up with. So, I’m hard to surprise,” he said. “But I’ve been impressed with the genuine admiration of public service and the level of thoughtfulness, and actually the openness to different points of view.”
English said he was delighted at the high level of student participation during his visit.
“[Harvard] takes seriously the opportunities for students. A lot of universities would say they focus on the students, but when you come here, you actually do spend the majority of your time speaking to students, and I really enjoy that,” he said.
English is the most recent — and only international — IOP visiting fellow to come to Harvard this school year. The other three visiting fellows for fall 2018 are all former mayors of U.S. cities.
As a parting note, English gave a piece of advice to budding politicians, encouraging them to think on a deeper level about what they can bring to public service.
“Competence and knowledge matter a lot in politics,” he said. “By far the majority of it is work that can be done well by people who are knowledgeable, curious, and also able to interact with a wide range of people in pushing ideas or getting things done.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At every House on campus, from 4 p.m. to 8 a.m., a security guard is stationed at the main entrance. Many Harvard students will give their security guard a wave when they walk back into their building at night — but for Dunster students, John Pomeroy was more than just a security guard. Throughout his 14 years at Dunster, he became a fixture of the House. Those who knew him say he was a jokester, a wise confidant, a storyteller, and most of all, a true friend to all who stepped into his office.
“He conveyed to all a spirit of helpfulness that went well beyond the routine responsibilities of a security guard. Like many of his counterparts across campus, he became part of the community sharing his wisdom with Dunster students and tutors and giving them encouragement in their studies and activities,” former Dunster Faculty Dean Roger B. Porter wrote in an emailed statement.
Pomeroy died on Oct. 14 at the age of 74. He leaves behind his wife, three children, and eight grandchildren. Before working at Harvard as a security guard, he served in the United States Navy from 1962 to 1964 and owned several businesses.
Since 2004, Pomeroy's was the first face students would see, greeting them with a smile, as they walked into Dunster house. For many Dunster students, he was also the first person they met as a sophomore when they picked up their keys at the start of the school year.
“I just remember seeing this big smiling face and this really welcoming presence in the guard's office when I first walked in,” said Janani Krishnan-Jha ’20, a current student in Dunster House. “When he asked me questions about myself, I just felt like he really cared and that he really was listening to me.”
Not only was Pomeroy a welcoming and friendly face, but he would always make time for conversation. Students said he had a knack for names and would ask for updates on previous conversations. Too often students said they would lose track of time speaking with him.
“You couldn't go by the front desk, which is the main entrance in and out of Dunster, without stopping and talking to him for at least 10 minutes,” said Cheryl Chen, one of the Dunster faculty deans. “It always made me happy when I walked out and he was at his desk, so I'll miss that.”
Throughout his time at Dunster, Pomeroy made an extraordinary impact on its students and affiliates, according to those who knew him. He dedicated his life, in the House and beyond, to giving to others.
“John was a one of a kind person. There are a few people that you get to meet in your life that truly impact you and change you for the better in ways that you would never have imagined,” Timothy Kang ’18 said. “I want to say — not saying that I've lived the longest of lives — but I want to say that John is one of those people, definitely for me, and for so many people that pass through this house.”
“It was just remarkable how many people he could connect with. It wasn't like he was friends with just seniors or a certain group within the community. If you gave him the time and just started to talk to him, you could be in there for hours,” said Emma M. Orcutt ’19, Dunster House Committee chair.
Pomeroy was a storyteller, and a number of Dunster students remembered lessons they learned from him sharing experiences from his own life.
“One thing that I have remembered in this week following his passing and reflecting about his life is his tremendous capacity to love. I learned a lot about what true love is by hearing him talk about his wife,” Krishnan-Jha said.
Pomeroy was friendly to everyone he met regardless of their background.
“He could sit there and talk to the president of the United States and he could sit there and talk to one of the custodial staff.” said Nasser Hussain ’08. “He could do that with recognizing both of their humanity, without elevating one over the other, and without he, himself, feeling too uncomfortable and being very respectful of both their presences.”
Not only did he connect with students throughout their time as undergraduates, but he kept in touch with some as they furthered their careers and their educations.
Hussain met Pomeroy during a routine lockout in 2005, as a sophomore in Dunster house and became a close friend of Pomeroy’s for 13 years, keeping in regular contact with him well beyond his time at the College. Pomeroy was a trusted confidant for Hussain throughout his time at Columbia getting his Ph.D. — which John encouraged him to pursue — and became an essential part of his most formative years, according to Hussain. Hussain graduated with his Ph.D. this year and shared that moment with Pomeroy, something that he says he will cherish forever.
“I haven't met anybody like him. I've been at Harvard, at Columbia, I've worked at cool places in London, I've experienced a breadth of life, you could say, and there's good people out there,” said Hussain. “But I've never met anybody like John. Ever.”
Pomeroy also played an important role in the lives of other security guards at Harvard. He trained numerous new guards including his fellow Dunster guard, Theresa Gumes — whom he called his “Dunster wife” — and Adams guards William Oliverio and Evens Pierre.
“He was a good source of advice, and he would come to be a person to lean on and go to with anything, any kind of advice or things like that. It was a good relationship from the beginning,” Oliverio said.
At a wake held in Pomeroy’s honor on Oct. 18, his real family and his Dunster family finally got the chance to meet. While emotional for many, the wake was a chance for his co-workers and family members to share stories and memories.
Oliverio, who also attended the wake, said he was excited to see so many students there. An official Harvard shuttle brought the students and Dunster affiliates to the ceremony.
“It was a strong symbol of what John meant here at Harvard and Dunster House and I think he would have liked to have seen such a full force there,” Oliverio said. “Seeing that bus at the back of the parking lot was really an overwhelming show of presence.”
Students said Pomeroy’s impact and grandfatherly presence will long remain in Dunster House.
“The best way to celebrate him is to try to practice the kind of warmth towards others that was so much a part of his whole way of existing,” Sean D. Kelly, Dunster faculty dean said. “Every time we find ourselves doing that successfully I hope we'll think of that as a tribute to him and that's the way I think he'll live on in the house, one of the ways.”
“I miss him every day, as you walk past his office and you expect him to be there,” Orcutt said. “I hope people remember that he was such an incredible figure for this house. He was not only someone that kept you safe and looked out for you, but someone who made it feel like home, really for me, made Harvard finally feel like home.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard continues to grapple with shifts in federal immigration policies that affect its affiliates, some faculty who focus on immigration patterns and policy want a larger platform to voice their expertise and support staff and students directly affected by the changes
Under President Donald Trump, the future of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program remains in doubt, new restrictions have made it harder for foreign students from certain countries to obtain visas, and Harvard workers who hold Temporary Protected Status find their futures in limbo.
One way in which faculty have begun to collaborate with students, staff, and administrators on these issues is through the Harvard Community Organized for Immigration Action. According to their website, HCOIA, a new group established at the beginning of the school year, aims to respond to “anti-immigration rhetoric and policy” by “bringing the University’s resources to bear on the problem both internally and in the wider community.”
Several faculty members said they believe this new combined effort between faculty, staff, and students serves as the most productive way to address immigration concerns at Harvard.
“I’m really inspired by the design and the structure of HCOIA and how it is a coalition of students and staff members and faculty,” said Kristina Shull, a post-doctoral fellow in the Charles Warren Center for Studies in American History. “The ethos of it is that for people in the coalition who are the most directly affected by these issues to have the loudest voice, so I think that that’s definitely going in the right direction.”
Many faculty members who work on immigration issues emphasized that they have valuable perspectives the University should take into account when planning Harvard's official efforts to advocate for less restrictive immigration policies.
“I think that faculty whose research expertise is relevant to the issues in question are a tremendous resource available to the University administration for consultation, participation, coordination as befits the particular issue being lobbied around,” said Kirsten Weld, a social sciences professor and member of HCOIA.
Weld also said that faculty involvement is particularly important because the uncertainty and stress caused by immigration issues often impacts their interactions with students.
“I think faculty do really care about this issue because it affects their teaching, it affects my classroom,” Weld said. “It affects their time management, it affects their sleep, it affects their general levels of stress and anxiety in ways that are corrosive to the work that we're all trying to do at the University.”
Education Professor Roberto G. Gonzales said Harvard Legal Counsel Robert W. Iuliano sought out his expertise while working on a series of amicus briefs in defense of DACA last year.
“I shared findings of my research with them and shared also a declaration I wrote,” Gonzales said. “I think on campus, that’s where I’ve been able to kind of leverage my expertise to inform the larger efforts on behalf of the University.”
History and Literature Lecturer Emily Pope-Obeda said there is room for improvement in coordination between faculty and administrators, though.
“It seems like the initiatives and efforts coming out of the administration were pretty separate and were not necessarily informed by a lot of the faculty,” Emily Pope-Obeda, a lecturer in History and Literature, said.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow has begun to consult with faculty since he took office in July. Last month, President Lawrence S. Bacow held a meeting with members of HCOIA — and University spokesperson, Melodie L. Jackson said he has sought out faculty voices when considering immigration issues in his first months at Harvard's helm.
“President Bacow has discussed immigration issues with faculty, students and staff from around the University, including those who are part of Harvard Community Organizing for Immigration Action,” she wrote in an email Wednesday. "Harvard remains deeply committed to supporting those in our community who have been impacted by changes in the federal government’s TPS, DACA and other immigration policies, and we will continue to make every effort to have our voice heard and to advocate for permanent legislative solutions to these challenging issues."
Gonzales said it seems that so far, Bacow has focused primarily on efforts beyond Harvard's gates.
“I think we’re very early in the Bacow presidency, and it seems to me that he’s focused his early attention on more outfacing activities, so being a public presence, doing the lobbying, I think actively trying, getting Harvard’s name out there,” he said.
Bacow traveled to Washington, D.C. over the summer to meet with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. Immigration was one item on the agenda.
"[I] talked to people about immigration issues, about DACA, about the importance of continuing to extend the protection of Temporary Protected Status for students, for staff, for others, why it was important that places like this continue to be open to talented men and women from around the world," Bacow said in September.
Though some faculty say there have not been many coordinated efforts between faculty and administrators, the past year has seen a number of faculty initiatives, including a planned act of civil disobedience in which 31 faculty members were arrested.
“I was really encouraged, as a second week faculty member at an institution, to see how ready faculty were to take an action in support of their students and the broader Harvard community,” Pope-Obeda said.
Ahmed Ragab, an associate professor of Science and Religion at the Harvard Divinity School, took part in the 2017 protest just an hour after he was naturalized as a citizen. Ragab said that unlike many immigrant advocate groups who demonstrate throughout the country, the Harvard faculty members who were arrested did not face charges.
“Ultimately, the fact that this did not happen to us is again another testament to the privilege that we have,” Ragab said. “We need to exercise our privilege and use our privilege to protect or to sort of speak for those who do not have the same kind of privilege.”
Faculty have also invested in educating Harvard affiliates by elevating the voices of other immigration experts. Last semester, faculty hosted a series of events  with the goal of creating a space for dialogue regarding not only DACA, but issues including Temporary Protected Status and support for undocumented students. Weld mentioned that while they did receive funding from a variety of institutions throughout the school, “the impetus for it was entirely faculty-driven.”
With the new coordinated efforts of HCOIA, faculty are beginning to think about developing plans around immigration issues they feel Harvard has not yet fully addressed.
“Another question is what would happen if ICE came to campus? Do educators and faculty and staff on campus have direction or a plan for that? And that’s something I’d like to see being developed over this year,” said Shull, referred to Immigrations and Custom Enforcement, the federal agency that deports undocumented immigrants.
Weld echoed similar concerns over Harvard’s preparedness to address the repeal of TPS, specifically for Salvadoran staff. TPS provides legal protections for immigrants from countries plagued by war or natural disaster. A federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting TPS holders earlier this month, but whether they will be allowed to remain in the United States legally in the long-term remains uncertain.
“It's my understanding that there are something on the order of between 200 and 250 Salvadoran TPS holders among the custodial and culinary staff of the university, and if the legal appeals don't manage to reverse that, then in I believe September of 2019, those people are going to lose their ability to work legally and their status overnight,” she said. “That seems to me like something the University should have a contingency plan for.”
When it comes to organizing plans to address these immigration concerns, Pope-Obeda stressed that while faculty provide a crucial perspective, those who are most closely impacted by the issues should assume leading roles.
“I think as faculty members, especially those of us who have the privilege to be secure in our own citizenship status, it's important for us not to rest on that and to take the lead from the impacted groups,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Starting next semester, some students might find themselves rating their courses on a different evaluation platform set to replace the “Q Guide,” the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ current course evaluation system.
Last year, an FAS committee chose a new course evaluation platform provider, “Blue,” which the College’s Office of Undergraduate Education intends to eventually replace the “Q Guide.” Currently, the Q Guide allows students to evaluate their courses and instructors through a series of multiple choice questions and open-ended responses.
Elisabeth L. Laskin, assistant dean of undergraduate education, is seeking faculty members in the Arts and Humanities and Social Sciences divisions who will agree to pilot the Blue platform in spring 2019.
“These scores will not be immediately accessible by students in following years,” Laskin wrote in an email, citing the potential change in response rate and the lack of data for benchmarking.
In addition to the push by the Undergraduate Education office to convince professors to pilot the system, the Undergraduate Council is soliciting student input on the course evaluation system redesign. The Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning is hosting focus group sessions for undergraduates to provide feedback on the redesign of the Q Guide.
Some UC representatives involved in the redesign feedback process are encouraging student participation because they said they believe undergraduate perspectives will play an important role in revising the old system.
“Providing input into matters that affect us and our education is extremely important, and I hope to be able to provide that as well as to hear from fellow students and administrators.” Jungyeon Park ’20, an Undergraduate Council representative, wrote in an emailed statement.
According to Park, undergraduate interest in providing feedback on the Q Guide was greater than initial expectations, which led the UC to add focus group sessions.
“There were initially three planned, but they were filled very quickly,” wrote Park. “We added an additional two focus groups so that more students can partake in them.”
Jenny Y. Gan ’22, another UC representative involved in the redesign, said the Q Guide changes come at a time when other undergraduate academic changes may be afoot. FAS has also recently explored the elimination of “Shopping Week,” a Harvard tradition that allows College students to walk in and out of class for a week before ultimately enrolling in courses.
“Since the future of Shopping Week is in jeopardy, this Q Guide renewal is critical,” Gan said. “People are going to rely on it more if we no longer have Shopping Week to test out classes.”

Former Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith took the stand Tuesday to defend his role in maintaining the College’s race-conscious admissions practices on the seventh day of Harvard’s high-profile admissions trial.
Specifically, Smith spent much of his roughly three-hour long testimony defending the conclusions of a committee he formed in 2017 to research race-neutral alternatives to affirmative action. The “Smith Committee” concluded that "Harvard could not both achieve its diversity interests and achieve other equally important educational outcomes, such as academic excellence” — a finding Smith stood by on the witness stand Tuesday.
Smith's testimony comes during the second week of a trial that is expected to conclude in early November. At stake is whether or not Harvard discriminates against Asian-American applicants, as anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions alleges in its 2014 suit against the University. Among other charges, SFFA claims that Harvard has not fulfilled the Supreme Court’s requirement that colleges should give “serious, good faith consideration of workable race-neutral alternatives” to race-based affirmative action.
Smith said in his testimony that he selected the other two members of his committee — Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana — for their understandings of the admissions process and the undergraduate educational experience, respectively. In discussions of their findings, the three were often joined by attorneys from the University’s Office of the General Counsel.
According to the committee’s final report, the percentage of admitted students with the highest academic ratings on the admissions office’s internal scale “would be expected to drop from 76% to 66%,” if a race-neutral alternative was implemented.
“The committee felt [this change] was a significant drop,” Smith said Tuesday.
This is not the first time the Smith Committee has entered the courtroom — SFFA expert witness Richard D. Kahlenberg ’85, an education researcher and fellow at the Century Foundation, testified about the committee Monday, charging that the group did not adequately consider race-neutral alternatives.
Smith also noted that the College already tried one measure that has been suggested as a race-neutral alternative — eliminating Early Action admissions — and this did not increase diversity. With the Early Action program, students can apply to the College in the fall and receive a non-binding offer of admission by mid-December.
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences voted to eliminate this program in 2007. By 2011, Early Action was reinstated after Smith and the Faculty concluded that the program’s absence “wasn’t helping” and “was at times hurting” Harvard’s admissions process — specifically, the College’s ability to retain high-performing admits of underrepresented minority backgrounds.
The students, rather than applying in the Regular Decision pool, were taking their talents to colleges and universities which continued to offer Early Action or Early Decision programs, Smith testified Tuesday.
“While this race-neutral alternative may work for other institutions, it’s our experience — our recent experience — that it does not work for us,” Smith said.
SFFA lawyer J. Scott McBride asked Smith if race-neutral alternatives were rejected by the committee because they may affect the status of legacy admission, the special consideration the children of Harvard graduates in the admissions process. Smith denied this claim.
“I can envision a simulation where you would eliminate the consideration of race of one factor among many but you still have the consideration of alumni,” Smith said.
In the end, Smith said the committee "felt that no racial alternative could substitute the consideration of race."
"I think it’s a part of the applicant’s experiences,” Smith said. “It's not necessarily an impact on every applicant’s record, but in many cases the experiences of the cultural and racial background has affected their life.”
Smith is not the first top Harvard administrator to take the stand; Dean of Admissions Rakesh Khurana finished his testimony Tuesday morning. Former University President Drew G. Faust is scheduled to appear in court within the next week. Smith said he spent a significant amount of time preparing for his three-hour testimony — he even took a sabbatical from his position as a professor of engineering and applied sciences.
Harvard lawyer Seth P. Waxman ’73 ended the former dean’s testimony on a moment of levity.
“Go back to your sabbatical,” Waxman said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Xenophobia and populism make it hard for leaders to push for better immigration policies in the Americas, Former Prime Minister of Peru Beatriz Merino and former California Representative Loretta L. Sanchez told an audience at the Institute of Politics Tuesday night. Both women, however, urged aspiring leaders not to let that stop them from trying.
Addressing immigration and the role it plays in the politics of their countries, Merino and Sanchez compared their experiences in leadership as a Peruvian former head of state and an American former legislator of Mexican heritage, respectively.
“You can tell [populists] all day long that immigrants give more to the United States in taxes than they take in services. The wavelength of ‘here are all the reasons why immigrants are good’ don’t work,” Sanchez said. “It’s an emotional issue, and populism is based on emotion.”
The event, called “Immigration Through the Lens of Latina Leaders,” attracted around 60 attendees. Topics included the recent increase in Venezuelan immigrants to Peru and the extra tenacity it requires for women to rise in the ranks of political leadership.
“At the end of the day, it is always about values and integrity,” Merino, who was the first woman to be a prime minister in Latin America, said.
Immigration has been a hot political topic for several years — especially since the 2016 U.S. presidential election —and Harvard’s campus has been no exception.
In his opening remarks, Fernando M. Reimers, an Education School professor who moderated the event, referenced University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s speech at his inauguration two weeks ago. Bacow spoke about his refugee parents and his conviction that immigrants are indispensable to Harvard and American society.
Merino on Tuesday painted a less sunny picture. She said she was having apprehensions about the state of democracy amid the growing nationalist rhetoric in Peru.
“One would have thought that democracy was a safe ship, where we were all going to sail for the rest of our lives,” Merino said. “And then, suddenly, populism came along.”
“Then, of course, populism based itself in nationalism,” she added. “But then it’s only a step to racism.”
Sanchez, whose parents immigrated from Mexico, spoke of her personal experience with racism during her time working in government. Following her election to Congress in 1996, then-Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich initiated an investigation believing, Sanchez said, that she “drove a bus from Mexico with illegals” to vote for her.
Sanchez also stressed the importance of knowing the “unwritten rules” of politics, especially for marginalized groups like women or Latinx people.
“We need to decide we’re gonna run,” Sanchez said, cautioning that encouragement is less often extended to underrepresented groups.
Recounting her family’s immigration story, Sanchez advised the audience to approach contentious debates on immigration with the power of the personal story, which she said carries far more weight than studies or statistics.
The forum was the result of a collaboration between the IOP and Conexión, an organization that aims to provide Latinx Americans with mentorship and professional support.
“It’s Hispanic Heritage Month, I think it’s important to demonstrate that we pay attention to these things, that we know that it matters,” Phyllis Barajas, Founder and CEO of Conexíon said. “And as we stated, these are our neighbors to the south, and they’re very important. They’re intertwined economically, socially, militarily, in all phases they’re intertwined with us.”

As the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences grapples with the results of its first comprehensive climate survey, Dean of SEAS Francis J. Doyle III said last week the School will strive for transparency and release a “completely candid, transparent disclosure of the things we learned.”
“We didn't sugarcoat things, we didn't try to hide behind the averages of the population because quite frankly, that was one of the compelling messages: that averages are deeply misleading,” he said. “When we drilled down into groups within that overall demographic, there are very different messages. So we felt it was critical that we address these. That we own the challenges and issues that we've got.”
The survey, conducted last spring, polled SEAS affiliates about their experiences with aspects of the school including its overall climate, career growth, and bias and harassment. Of the more than 2,100 members of SEAS, 436 members responded, representing a 21 percent completion rate.
The report on the survey identified “a breakdown in confidence” in the school’s ability “to meaningfully address negative behaviors and actions in the workplace, lab, and classroom.” The results also spotlighted statistics for incidents of harassment or discrimination: Twenty-seven percent of survey respondents indicated that they’ve experienced harassment or discrimination at SEAS.
Given the low response rate, Doyle said SEAS has been hosting a series of conversations with School affiliates to better account for the voices of people who did not respond to the survey. Doyle said SEAS invited Judy “JJ” Jackson, a diversity and inclusion administrator at MIT, to facilitate the conversations.
In order to keep the meetings “candid” and “open,” Doyle does not attend most of the meetings. He said he attended one staff meeting, where he fielded anonymous questions by text.
“Eighty percent of the people haven't weighed in, and you can speculate on a wide range of possible reasons for why that may be. From apathy — disconnected, unconcerned, uninterested — to so alarmed that they're afraid to reply for fear of being singled out. That's a wide spectrum. That's the entire spectrum, right?” he said.
The School’s Committee on Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging, led by Alexis J. Stokes and Doyle, held off from developing plans from the survey results in order to ensure more voices could be heard first, according to Doyle.
With the meetings almost over, Doyle said the committee will soon develop a list of priorities for the school to take moving forward.

When Megan Turner (not her real name) asked her high school teacher for help applying to Harvard, she hoped for a glowing letter of recommendation.
What she got was a “negative” essay referencing her “‘small-town’ insecurity” that almost sank her candidacy, according to previously confidential papers released in the Harvard admissions trial Monday.
The teacher’s recommendation “raise[d] flags about [Megan’s] personal qualities, her ability to interact with others, and her ‘brightness,’” the filing reads.
Details of Megan’s case — as well as evaluations of 10 other Harvard hopefuls also given fake names — surfaced in a 13-page court filing titled “Discussion Guide to the 2012 Casebook.” Each summer, the College’s Admissions Office profiles a handful of previous applicants in a “casebook” and distributes it to employees. The book is meant to teach staffers how to evaluate candidates, Director of Admissions Marlyn E. McGrath ’70 testified last week. Monday’s filing is the 2012 iteration of this training manual.
Harvard chose to highlight the candidates in the casebook because they were borderline cases, meaning the Admissions Office struggled to decide whether to accept or reject them. For each applicant, the document details the bullet-pointed factors that rendered the high schooler “appealing” and the traits that gave Harvard “pause.” It also provides the final outcome for each student.
The University’s lead trial lawyer William F. Lee ’72 introduced the casebook in court to bolster his argument that Harvard’s admissions process is holistic. The College’s Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 has repeatedly said his office considers each applicant as an individual and not as part of a demographic group.
Whether or not this is true will prove key in the high-stakes trial, which kicked off Oct. 15 in the John Joseph Moakley United States Courthouse in Boston. At stake is whether or not Harvard’s race-conscious admissions policies have led the school to illegally discriminate against Asian-American applicants, as anti-affirmative action group Students For Fair Admissions alleged when it sued the University in 2014.
Harvard has repeatedly denied SFFA’s charges. If the case winds up before the majority-conservative Supreme Court, it could spell the end of affirmative action in the United States.
For Megan — described in the document as a “Native American and Caucasian young woman from rural area of a Mountain States [sic]” — things got worse before they got better.
Reviewers admitted Megan's application essays were “very well-written” but lamented they “came across as very negative and dismissive of her high school context.”
“Some readers may even find them slightly arrogant,” the filings read.
Still, Megan was “very bright and very active,” a “school leader,” and possessed “many energies.” So Harvard began making calls. Admissions officers spoke with the teacher who wrote the less-than-flattering recommendation, his teaching assistant, and Megan’s school guidance counselor.
In the end, “after many hours of debate,” Megan won a spot at the College.
The filing shows others were less lucky. And for anxious high schoolers gunning for a spot in the Class of 2023, the document offers coveted insight into what Harvard seeks out — and what it shuns.
The students described in the document hail from widely different backgrounds and represent varied skill sets, ranging from a “Vietnamese-American woman” who attended a “public school in the heart of a major American city” to “one of the top female recruits for women’s crew.”
But stories of successful applicants prove a common truth: Harvard admissions officers are looking for academic superstars who have overcome adversity in their personal lives and can offer a clear vision of what they would accomplish in Cambridge.
Smarts reigned supreme. In nine of the 11 cases, admissions officers pointed to strong academic performance as a compelling reason for admission. The word “bright” appears eight times in the document.
“Extremely bright student across academic fields with very strong faculty support,” one admissions officer noted of “Sergei Liukin.”
“Inherently very bright; impressive SAT II results despite substandard K-10 education,” another admissions employee wrote of “Mandisi Botlhoko.”
Staffers were particularly impressed when applicants performed well in school despite facing difficulties at home. Some praised students’ ability to maintain top-notch grades even after moving around and switching schools multiple times. Other employees noted that candidates had surmounted “family upheaval,” “modest backgrounds,” and “financial difficulties” to keep their GPAs intact.

But admissions officers also looked to the future. Reviewers repeatedly sought to assess whether applicants would find a way to thrive on Harvard’s campus.
Sergei “would make the most of Harvard academics,” the filing reads. “Thomas Smith” would do the same with public service organization Phillips Brooks House and the Institute of Politics, per the document. And “Peter Duran… could do [robotics] in the School of Engineering or Applied Sciences [sic].”
Still, not everyone was successful. In almost every case that ended in a Harvard “yes,” one more factor came into decisive play — the applicant’s charisma.

For one student, nicknamed “Grace Blake Cheng,” personality paid off in spades.
Grace was a “strong student” in high school, but nothing exceptional. One reviewer noted her test scores “suggest she won’t be a top engineering student at Harvard” — and predicted she “will have to work hard here.”
Nonetheless, “unlike most in the casebook,” Grace was a “clear admit.”
“Grace’s teachers, guidance counselor, and alumni interviewer describe her in terms we rarely read,” the document states. “A true ‘1 personal’ — one of the few we see each year.”
Her personality was so “unusually appealing” that she earned a “likely letter” meant to demonstrate Harvard’s “enthusiasm for her case.”
“We include [Grace] because it shows the importance that non-academic and non-extracurricular factors in our process [sic],” the document reads.
Though all of the applicants are “admissible,” the filing asserts almost “none is clear [sic]” — and it tells you why.
The document lists “pause factors” for each candidate. These more problematic traits — including less impressive grades, uninspiring extracurriculars, and excessive braggadocio — spurred lengthy deliberations in the Admissions Office, waitlist placements, and calls to a plethora of teachers and counselors. Once or twice, admissions staffers phoned the students themselves.
Comparatively lackluster grades or test scores frequently led admissions officers to hesitate.

“While a strong overall candidate, Evelyn [Satmar]’s credentials are not unusual in our applicant pool,” the document reads.
“Certainly a strong student but — believe it or not! — not unusually strong in Harvard’s applicant pool,” officers wrote about another student. “Nothing here elevates Peter into the ‘1 academic’ circle.”
Admissions officers also took note of activities outside the classroom. Reviewers mentioned that at least three candidates failed to find an “extracurricular niche” in high school.
“While the package is appealing, the case lacks the ‘hook’ provided by a special academic or extracurricular talent,” officers wrote of Mandisi. “Not clear whether his running will translate to college competition.”
“What, exactly, will she do at Harvard?” reviewers asked of Evelyn.
For other applicants, admissions officers raised more personal concerns — many related to ego.

Two candidates’ pause factors included “arrogance.” One was placed on the waitlist and never accepted; the other admitted to Harvard only “after many hours of debate.”
Admissions officers particularly pondered whether high schoolers’ hubris would hurt them at Harvard — wondering whether applicants could successfully trade standout status for relative anonymity among hundreds of star students.
“What will his transition be like — from big fish in small pond to Harvard — and how will Sergei interact with roommates, classmates, and administrators?” one reviewer wrote.
For Tracey Eckham, it was her failure to “interact” while still in high school that proved fatal.
Admissions officers took Tracey to task for being “unhappy.” Despite achieving “good scores,” pursuing “many interests,” and taking a “challenging” high school “curriculum,” Tracey was waitlisted and eventually denied admission.
“Letters refer to her as a bit of a loner (‘lone wolf’) and quite driven; letter from crew coach even suggests that she may be depressed and is withdrawn at times,” Tracey’s admissions officer wrote.
“Personal qualities very hard to assess — who is Tracey Eckham?” one reviewer asked.

The leaves are falling, and the air near Tatte smells of pumpkin pie. We’re between midterms, so let’s give people pumpkin to talk about!
Jack-o-Lantern
Carve into your pumpkin a warm, welcoming smile to greet your friends or a creepy leer to keep away unwanted guests. Or, just put a candle in it for when you can’t find your way to the light switch in the morning. (Or at least an electric candle—as open flames are not technically allowed in dorms).
Door Stop
It’s annoying to stay up to let your roommate in when they forget their key (or worse, to be woken up in the dead of night). And besides, a potential thief would ideally stub their toe trying to kick the pumpkin out of the way, letting out a high-pitched scream. Or while they lift it out of the door frame, the door would slam shut in their face. Either way, the robber is sabotaged and you can call HUPD. This one’s a win-win.
Cinderella Carriage
The Quad too far for you? Have no fear — your fairy godmother will show up, console you about your midterm results, and whisk you away to your party this weekend. Maybe you won’t feel as hollow inside after.
Pumpkin Keg
To perpetuate the Oktoberfest vibes, use our big, orange friends to drain a beer at your next party (or live life on the edge and try pumpkin ale). Stock up, though — one medium-sized pumpkin only holds about 6-10 standard drinks. Or, if you want to go non-alcoholic, spice things up with some pumpkin-spice tea (perhaps with that gourd-geous someone in your life).
Wait for the Great Pumpkin
Let’s throwback to those happy golden childhood days of Charlie Brown and be Linus waiting for the Great Pumpkin. The real question is: do we wait in a pumpkin patch, the Old Yard, or Tercentenary Theatre?
Be the Gourd of the Rings this autumn, but try not to get smashed. The poor pumpkins can’t handle it. And if you see pumpkin in your pi while solving your next math pset, piece out and enjoy a slice of real pie. It’s not an irrational thing to do.
