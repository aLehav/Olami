“Oh, there’s Arabic graffiti?”
Artist eL Seed is used to comments like these. He heard them echoed as he stood outside the Science Center on the morning of Monday, March 26. eL Seed, a self-proclaimed “calligraffiti” artist, stood outside discussing the common reactions to his artwork—like the one above—from the Arab and Muslim community. Behind him, a team of volunteers set up a large blank canvas.
From 11 a.m. to roughly 4 p.m., eL Seed worked continuously to create a piece that is part Arabic calligraphy, part graffiti, and part public performance art. He added layer after layer of color and shape, using impeccably straight strokes to form the phrase “take back the purple” in Arabic. “Take back the purple” is a symbolic allusion to the old political regime in Tunisia that was toppled in last year’s revolution. “eL Seed has been very involved in post-revolutionary Tunisia, and so part of what he’s doing today is linked with some of that,” says Paul Beran, director of the Outreach Center at the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Harvard. “The art form itself is very interesting because it’s playing off of both calligraphy and graffiti.” eL Seed’s radically unique interpretation of traditional Arabic calligraphy jumped off of the pages of Islamic manuscripts and landed in the middle of Harvard, directly engaging the undergraduate community.
eL Seed has pieces all over the world—especially in Quebec, the Middle East, and France. Although he grew up in France, eL Seed is ethnically Tunisian and currently lives in Quebec. “I never felt really French, and I really felt the need to get back to my roots. I thought a way to do that was to learn Arabic, so I found Arabic calligraphy,” he says. “I started creating my own calligraphy without any rules, because traditional Arabic calligraphy is very in the box with a lot of rules that you need to know, so I started incorporating Arabic into graffiti.”
eL Seed’s modernization of this deeply religious art form echoes a greater desire for the Muslim community to preserve and integrate its culture with the force of globalization according to Ali Asani, professor of Indo-Muslim and Islamic Religion and Cultures and head of the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations. This type of artwork creates a context that artists from the Islamic community can use to reinterpret traditional art forms. “It’s a way in which people are able to connect their experiences to modernity, but [can also] root it in their past,” says Asani. “With calligraffiti you see a traditional form of art that has been highly developed and highly esteemed in the Arab world now being utilized in a different context—in the context of graffiti and the emergence of urban culture.” Artists like eL Seed strive to prove that art in the Islamic world has an extremely rich history and continues to grow in both practice and potential.
The interest in the roots of Islamic art and culture not only links eL Seed’s work to tradition but also creates a forum for his community to feel a sense of empowerment in politics. eL Seed prompts the public to make changes in society by placing powerful words in outdoor spaces—not by criticizing the government. “People were telling me that the mural was a part of their soul, so that was very touching,” he said about a mural he recently finished in Kairouan, Tunisia, with the help of several civilian volunteers. “In the Arab and Muslim community, I feel that we need to make another step forward, because the art scene isn’t completely open yet. We need to push a bit, shake the people up a bit.” The conspicuous showing of his work in public is his solution to this. “When you paint on the street, it’s like you’re taking back the public space. Why do they call it public space if you can’t paint in it?”
This highlights the significance of eL Seed’s performance-based exhibition at Harvard. It both connects undergraduates to a distinctly different form of Islamic art and prompts them to reevaluate stereotypes they may currently hold. “The arts humanize and give [us] a very different lens to view the Arab world than just looking at things with the view of political conflict,” says Asani.
But ultimately for eL Seed, functions of politics and public art aside, calligraffiti is most importantly a form of artistic expression that empowers the Arabic community. “I’ll keep bringing my message to people and I’ll keep doing my art the way I want to do it,” he says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Friday morning set the tone for what was certain to be a rap battle for the ages—one He-bro versus another. Yes, two Jewish rappers, Maxbetter S. Vizelberg ’14 and Max Elstein Keisler—a third-year Extension School student—were set to have a rap battle near Harvard Hillel. Just as things were heating up, disaster struck: “I’m a pacifist,” Vizelberg said.
Indeed, both were uncomfortable with the idea of a “battle.” Elstein Keisler—or “DR K”—cited logistical problems and said that there wasn’t a good beat to rap to, and Vizelberg said plainly, “I don’t freestyle.”
Just as it looked like there wouldn’t be a battle after all, they both agreed to take a new approach and have, as DR K coined it, “the Harvard Cipher.” According to DR K, a cipher is a collaboration of two or more rappers freestyling with each other. The two rappers proceeded to show off their skills and elaborate on the role that Judiasm plays in their lives as rappers.
Vizelburg, who has had moderate YouTube success with Harvard- and Jewish-themed raps, shies away from categorization. “Personally, I would brand myself as a student and wouldn’t necessarily take the term rapper,” Vizelberg said. “I just happen to write poetry, which can be delivered in the form of raps, like with a beat in the background.” He maintained that he only raps occasionally: “I enjoy making raps for my friends for their birthdays or special events, maybe a holiday.” He thinks that the image of himself as a “Jewish rapper” might come from a YouTube video he made for JewishBoston.com but does not think it is an accurate representation of his work. “I wouldn’t label myself as a ‘Jewish rapper,’” Vizelberg said.
DR K also resists the idea of being categorized by his religion. “I do rap about Jewish issues, and I don’t avoid them, and I’m not going to be like, ‘Oh, don’t call me a Jewish rapper,’ but I’m not going to market myself as a Jewish rapper, you feel me?” he asked. DR K also recently released an album. “You know, I rap for myself man. I rap stuff I think about, stuff I care about,” DR K said. His album, called “Pay To The Order Of DR K,” covers a range of ideas, including uniquely Jewish issues. “I have a track on my album called ‘Where I’m From’ where I kind of rap the history of the Zionist movement in the whole 20th century.” His second album,which is in production, is a collaboration with other native Bostonian rappers.
Both acknowledge that Judaism is an influence in their art to different extents. Vizelberg said that he only writes about Judaism in his lyrics on an infrequent basis. “I’ll cater [raps] to important things that are relevant in [audience members’] lives, so if they’re not Jewish, then clearly the content wouldn’t be related to Judaism, but if they’re Jewish, then I’ll throw in some [relevant] aspects,” he said.
DR K presented a slightly different view on the role of Judaism in his lyrics. “I would say that it does play a pretty large influence, just because I’m a rapper, and…the culture I came from, what books I read growing up, and what politics I have—that’s very influenced by Judaism,” he said. DR K elaborated on the specific themes that Judaism brings into his work. “I’d say the feeling of being somewhat of an outsider in America shows up in my lyrics. That’s just the American Jewish experience of, you know, ‘You’re not quite in this one culture, and you’re not quite in this other one,’” he said.
What was supposed to be a rap battle ended in a short and simple cipher. It displayed the capabilities of these two very different students who refuse to be classified—even as rappers. “Shout out to your favorite Adams resident,” Max Vizelberg and the “real and trill” DR K for showing their lyrical capabilities and defining themselves outside of the Jewish Harvard rap community.

2011 was the 375th year of Harvard College, but it was also the fourth year of the Harvard College Program in General Education. The former anniversary was celebrated with a massive cake, but the latter may hold more significance for students. The new Gen Ed requirements have calcified a trend of seeking applicability instead of meaning out of the undergraduate education, a trend that betrays the ideals upon which Harvard as a college was founded. Pre-2007, this mentality was already pervasive in the actions and priorities of students, but now it is actually endorsed by the University. As one of the last cohort of students fulfilling their general requirements under the Core Curriculum instead of Gen Ed, I worry that the Core hasn’t been mourned enough. The Core provided a good education, and its trendy, 21st-century, interdisciplinary, “useful” replacement is an unwelcome change.
From the ’40s to today, college-wide undergraduate requirements have swung from being philosophical to applicable. In 1979, the College moved from mandating that students take courses in social sciences, humanities, and natural sciences to mandating courses in seven of eleven disciplines. Then-Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Henry A. Rosovsky oversaw the creation of 70-odd specific “Core” courses that were independent of any department. Then, in 2007, the faculty voted to move to Gen Ed, which requires students to take classes in eight general categories of learning. At the time, On Harvard Time joked that the curricular review committee had just used a “thesaurus.”
But a close look at the Core reveals that it is significantly different from Gen Ed. Under the Core, students are meant to learn methodologies of different academic disciplines: how to think like a historian (History B), an English professor (Literature A), a biologist  (Science B). This did mean that students often took Core classes on absurdly specific topics. New York Times columnist Ross G. Douthat ’02, one of the Core’s loudest critics, wrote in The Atlantic in 2005, “A Harvard graduate may have read no Shakespeare or Proust; he may be unable to distinguish Justinian the Great from Julian the Apostate, or to tell you the first ten elements in the periodic table (God knows I can't). But one need only mention ‘Mass Culture in Nazi Germany’ or ‘Constructing the Samurai’ and his eyes will light up with fond memories.”
In contrast, the Gen Ed categories are eminently applicable. These courses are meant to leave students versed in issues that have contemporary relevance, issues which they may use to make decisions about in the future. They will become “citizens of the world,” a phrase that, for me, always calls to mind George Clooney’s sterile technocrat in "Up in the Air." Thus, Gen Eds cover discrete sets of information on “important”—a wonderful euphemism for “fashionable”—topics. Courses like “Case Studies in Global Health,” “The Mainsprings of Global Power,” and “Thinking about the Constitution,” are the new ideal. Even rollover courses from the Core that are the same in overall content and instructor have shifted focus.
I think this is a mistake. True, the current dialogues on “global health” or “empire” are important, but they can be grasped by reading news articles for two hours. It is much harder to teach someone how to think like a historian or how to believe in the scientific method. This is indicated by the fact that Gen Eds have unwittingly become havens of grade deflation because often all they require for mastery is rote memorization rather than internalization of a new mindset. At the beginning of each shopping period, a common question in Gen Eds is “do you curve?” because everyone has caught on to the fact that Gen Ed’s intellectual framework is so weak.
Moreover, when the liberal arts try to be applicable, they cease to be liberal arts at all. Contrary to what Douthat posited, a liberal arts education is not and has never been about memorizing arbitrary tracts of information. It is about understanding the fundamental intellectual divisions of society—the economist and the social theorist or the scientist and the humanist. Once this is understood, it gives meaning to why some people believe Bohr’s model of the atom was the most important advancement of the 20th century and why others believe that James Joyce’s “Ulysses” was. Under the Core, the subject matter of a course was beside the point—the point was learning how to use a particular cognitive tool so that by the end of four years you could empathize with all epistemological worldviews.
Former president Charles W. Eliot, Class of 1853, wrote, at Harvard “the young man learns something of what has been done and thought in the world, before he takes active part in its work.” A Harvard education should not be valuable because it leaves students with relevant information; it should be valuable because it leaves students with meaningful analytical faculties. Indeed, understanding the difference between relevance and meaning and how to spot the qualities of each in any concrete initiative is the key reward of the liberal arts education. Thus, methodology and discipline, not subject, should be the priority when forming a cross-college curriculum. In this way, while the Core Curriculum sometimes descended into absurd specificities, it upheld the ideals of the liberal arts education. Harvard College need not lower itself to becoming a current events seminary; we can do better than that.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Justice for Trayvon” is the rallying cry for those demanding George Zimmerman’s immediate arrest in the shooting of Trayvon Martin. Yet forgotten in the rush to punish Zimmerman are the components of true justice: a presumption of innocence, dispassionate evaluation of the evidence, due process, and color-blindness. Justice means justice for all, and that means both Martin and Zimmerman.
New evidence continues to complicate a case that the media initially portrayed as clear-cut, turning many Americans against Zimmerman. Let’s survey the snags, not to discredit Martin’s account but to illustrate just how little we know with certainty about his death.
Did Zimmerman racially profile Martin in judging him “suspicious”? Here the distinction between racial profiling and holistic profiling is relevant. Zimmerman’s friend Frank Taaffe said young black males had committed a string of recent robberies in the diverse neighborhood. If Martin fit the profile of these specific suspects, was unfamiliar in the neighborhood, and was acting strangely in Zimmerman’s mind by walking behind houses, Zimmerman’s judgment was appropriate. It remains uncertain whether Zimmerman, mentor to two black children, uttered a racial slur in his 911 call.
Although Zimmerman made a poor judgment in following Martin, it isn’t clear that he wanted a confrontation. Zimmerman’s father said his son was only trying to follow Martin until he could locate an address to give police.
Who started the confrontation is also unclear. Martin’s family says Zimmerman caught up with, confronted, and attacked Martin. Zimmerman’s family says that after Zimmerman lost sight of Martin and turned back towards his vehicle, Martin confronted and attacked Zimmerman, breaking his nose and repeatedly smashing his head into the concrete. They say that Zimmerman only drew his weapon and shot Martin after Martin saw Zimmerman’s gun in his waistband and verbally threatened Zimmerman’s life.
Many claim police video of Zimmerman that night reveals no clear injuries. Zimmerman, however, had already received first aid and the police report shows that he was bleeding from the nose and the back of his head when police arrived. The medical records are not yet released.
There are three eyewitnesses in the case; two corroborate Zimmerman’s account. One says he saw Zimmerman, below Martin, crying for help while Martin beat him. Austin Brown, a black teenager, says he saw Zimmerman on the ground “moaning and crying for help.” Brown’s mother has since said police pressured him into giving more information than he remembered, but he repeated the claim afterwards. She may simply be concerned that her son will suffer backlash like Joe Oliver, a black supporter of Zimmerman, who says he has a “target on my back.” A third eyewitness says it was too dark to tell who was who.
Only non-eyewitnesses to the scuffle have corroborated Martin’s family’s account, but two voice identification experts said the screams in a 911 call during the incident are not Zimmerman’s.
Media coverage has favored Martin through selective images, descriptions, and context. Many simply reported that Zimmerman “confronted” and “gunned down” an unarmed teenager. For weeks, old photos of a much younger, smiling Martin were shown beside a mug shot of a much heavier, stony-faced Zimmerman. Few reported that Martin was several inches taller than Zimmerman. Zimmerman’s reported weight is outdated; he actually only weighs 170 pounds to Martin’s 160, according to Oliver. Zimmerman was labeled “white Hispanic,” a term helpful to the racial profiling narrative. Few corrected early reports that vastly overstated the frequency of Zimmerman’s 911 calls.
Zimmerman’s criminal history was reported quickly, but we only recently learned that Martin was repeatedly suspended from school, including for graffiti; was found with 12 pieces of women’s jewelry and a screwdriver in his backpack, a possible burglary tool; or that he might have punched a bus driver. The Martin family’s attorney said Trayvon’s past was “irrelevant,” yet has highlighted Zimmerman’s criminal history.
This is a very murky case and we still don’t know all the facts. More will be released to the upcoming grand jury. If the protests spurred a better investigation, great. Now we need to be patient and let the judicial system work.
Unfortunately, a rush to judgment continues. The media convicted Zimmerman long ago. Some even refuse to report his account. Much of the public is calling for violating due process by arresting Zimmerman before an indictment. Zimmerman, reportedly distraught, remains in hiding after he received death threats and the New Black Panther Party put a $10,000 bounty on him in return for a citizen’s arrest.
The national discussion on racial profiling sparked by Martin’s death is understandable: Racial profiling remains an issue in America. But that by itself doesn’t mean it occurred in this particular incident. The Sanford police department has poor relations with local blacks, but Jesse Jackson’s comment that Martin’s death proves that “blacks are under attack” was irresponsible. And it certainly doesn’t justify presuming guilty, without clear evidence, a man who claims he acted in self-defense simply because the person he shot happened to be black.
Both families involved in the tragedy are responding gracefully by calling for a full hearing of the facts. Zimmerman’s father said, “It's just amazing that some people are so hateful, and the people who are being hateful are the ones who know nothing about what happened.” Martin’s father said, "We're not asking for an eye for an eye, we're asking for justice, justice, justice."
Zimmerman may be guilty or he may not. Either way, he too deserves justice.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, University President Drew G. Faust and other high-ranking Harvard administrators officially inaugurated the new Army Senior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps office in the Student Organization Center at Hilles. At the ceremony, Lieutenant Colonel Timothy J. Hall, the director of Army SROTC at Harvard, announced that the program will, for the first time, offer classes for undergraduates on campus in the fall. This event marked yet another chapter in the University’s renewed relationship with ROTC, which returned to campus last year after the military repealed its “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy that Harvard had long opposed.
As we have previously argued, the return of the military to campus is a welcome move after the repeal of DADT. President Faust promised on numerous occasions that ROTC’s exile at Harvard would cease when the military abolished DADT and allowed gay and lesbian soldiers to serve in its ranks openly. Once the policy was repealed, the University, quite fairly, kept its word. More importantly, Harvard opened the door for a valuable form of public service—military service—to return to a place heavily steeped in the civic tradition of the armed services.
Harvard alumni have distinguished themselves on the field of battle by earning 17 Medals of Honor, the highest number among non-military institutes of higher education in the country. Indeed, since the earliest days of the country, our school provided support for America’s men and women in uniform. During the Revolutionary War, Continental Army troops briefly took up residence in Harvard Yard. Memorial Hall, a venerable landmark of our campus, was built to commemorate alumni who have served in uniform.
With these precedents in mind, Harvard seems to have handled well the manner in which it has welcomed back ROTC. A formal ceremony, with important officials in attendance, is a clear sign of the University’s support of the new relationship between Harvard and the Army. The solemnity and dignity of the occasion were more than merited, given the fact that the Army’s outpost at SOCH is the first physical military presence on our campus. Although ties with Naval ROTC are already established, cadets in that program continue to travel to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for training.
Although the discriminatory ways of the military have, for the most part, been amended, there is still room for improvement. It is especially troubling that individuals with a transgender identity are not allowed to serve openly. Harvard should work closely with both the military and advocacy groups on campus, like Queer Students and Allies, to promote greater inclusion in ROTC programs and provide a voice for those who still face a stigma in the armed forces. Yet the lingering flaws of the military do not warrant its continued expulsion from our school. Now that the Army has planted its flag, Harvard’s community should work with its representatives and be prepared to welcome further ROTC programs in the future.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Saturday, March 24, 2012, as I sat amidst the boxes of condoms, lubricant, and T-shirts and piles of evaluation forms, posters, and flyers, I began to wonder what exactly I had gotten myself into. Harvard’s inaugural Sex Week, planned by myself and the rest of the board of Sexual Health Education and Advocacy throughout Harvard College, was quite an undertaking. The week included twenty-plus events put on in conjunction with over thirty different student organizations and offices attended by roughly 1,700 people in total.
SHEATH set out to promote discourse and community building around the topics of sex and intimacy on campus, and with the support and contributions of all the individuals, students, student groups, and offices involved in Sex Week, we succeeded. Again and again as I reviewed the event evaluation forms, I saw variations on the same theme: talking about sex is important, and there needs to be a space to talk about sex here at Harvard. What I have learned in the course of Sex Week, though, is that talking about sex represents something much deeper.
Throughout the week, reporters peppered me with questions like, “Do college students really need an excuse to be talking about sex?”, “Isn’t this just a week for sluts?”, “Why are there so many faith-based events? What makes you think faith has anything to do with sex?”, and “Aren’t parents upset about all this? What do your parents think?” I found myself having less and less to say in reply. It seemed as though the unspoken assumption on the part of many reporters was that young people have never considered what love and sex look like in their own lives except in the most casual way. The further implication was that college students have nothing meaningful to say on the topic. I disagree strongly with both of these assertions.
Living in Cambridge, even if you are only here during your time at Harvard, you will notice that American culture places strong emphasis on sex as a site of social and personal meaning. From Sandra Fluke to Rick Santorum, contraception to abortion, marriage equality to divorce rates, and sex trafficking to sex scandals, sex is a topic that is very much alive in our national consciousness. Sex is presumed to reveal deep inner truths about us all. The ways in which we negotiate sex, love, and intimacy in our lives are imbued with powerful social meanings. In talking about sex and its role in our lives, our underlying assumptions about the world and our place in it are revealed. Sex Week allows us to use talking about sex as a lens through which to examine our lived experiences and our intellectual, emotional, and spiritual frameworks for navigating our relationships with ourselves and others. Moreover, it allows us the unique chance to learn the ways in which other people do the same.
Before Sex Week began, I would glibly quip that as a graduating senior I was most excited for the Job Fair co-sponsored by the Office of Career Services. However, the event that ended up being the most meaningful to me was one of the smallest of the week—a luncheon held by the Harvard Chaplains with fewer than ten students (and fifteen chaplains) in attendance. I wound up in a small discussion group with a chaplain, my roommate since junior year, and a few other students who I had never met. In that hour, I learned more about the woman who I had lived less than 100 feet away from for two years than I had learned in our friendship up to that point. Our lunch was one of the most intellectually and emotionally rich experiences I have had during my four years here, delving deep into what defines us as people as we spoke about our loved ones, our childhoods, and our shifting, evolving beliefs, thoughts, fears, and hopes for our lives.
That, to me, is the beauty of Sex Week. I would never have learned these things about my roommate without the space to start a conversation not just about sex, but about all those other deeply personal issues that sex touches upon. From those who never step foot into a Sex Week event to those who attend each one, I hope that the Harvard community will find more ways to engage in the thorough intellectual and emotional introspection that examining one’s own relationship(s) to love, sex, and sexuality demands, and to build relationships with each other in sharing what we have identified in ourselves and our communities. During next year’s Sex Week, I hope you will talk about sex, but more importantly, I hope you will listen.

UPDATED: April 2, 2012, at 4:02 a.m.
Three Harvard Business School faculty members won awards in the 2012 ecch Case Awards Competition, which recognizes outstanding case writing from around the world.
Winners came from thirteen schools in seven countries, demonstrating the growing popularity of the case study method of learning that originated at Harvard Business School.
The competition recognized the work of three Business School professors—Christopher A. Bartlett, John A. Deighton, and Hanna W. Halaburda.
Bartlett’s case—which was coauthored by Business School alumna Carole Carlson and examines the European breakfast foods company United Cereal—won in the Economics, Politics and Business Environment category.
Deighton and Halaburda’s cases both explored marketing challenges in a digital age. Halaburda tracked the development of The Lord of the Rings Online game and how its creators sought to differentiate it from competitors such as World of Warcraft in the multi-player online game market.
“Digital markets—markets involving the Internet and other digital technologies—are often characterized by network effects,” Halaburda said. “This case looks at successful entry strategies for new companies in a market that is characterized by these network effects.”
Halaburda’s case, which was co-written with recent Business School alumni Ivan Nausieda, Robert McKeon, and William Collis, won in the Hot Topic competition that focused this year on social media.
Deighton won in the Marketing category for “Dove: Evolution of a Brand,” a case which tracks the spread of Dove’s Real Beauty campaign over television and the Internet. “It’s a case about how a brand shifts from a fairly traditional position to something [Dove] called a brand with a point of view,” Deighton said.
“Dove had seen the opportunity to position itself around a feminist issue...namely the fact that the beauty industry was taunting them with unattainable standards of beauty,” he said.
Deighton added that late-night comedians and YouTube were both instrumental in attracting mainstream attention to the campaign.
Both Halaburda and Deighton said that their approach to case writing emphasized the way business scenarios could be examined in a classroom discussion.
“A good case [is based on] whether it introduces a good enough puzzle that students discover something that they did not know after discussion of the case,” Halaburda said.
The ecch Case Awards Competition, run annually since 1991, announced this year’s winners in February.

Children enjoyed Chinese-inspired activities like origami, calligraphy, and dragon face paint at a carnival on Sunday, intended to bring adopted Chinese children in the U.S. together for a day of fun while raising money to help a boy in a Chinese orphanage.
The event, which was organized by Harvard China Care, aimed to raise $5,000 to help fund surgery for TianLe, a Chinese orphan suffering from spina bifida, a birth defect that can cause paralysis.
Many Chinese parents, constrained by the country’s one-child policy, abandon daughters and disabled children like TianLe in orphanages, event organizers said.
Many of the rambunctious children who filled the Student Organization Center at Hilles on Sunday were adopted from such orphanages. These children, now living in Cambridge and the surrounding area with their adoptive families, participate in Harvard China Care’s year-round offerings for adopted Chinese children, including a program for 4- to 10-year-olds called Dumplings Playgroup and a mentoring program for teenagers.
Stephanie J. B. O’Neil, the mother of an adopted Chinese girl who participates in the Dumplings Playgroup, said that Harvard China Care gives her daughter an opportunity to connect with her Chinese heritage.
“China Care gives the girls what we can’t,” O’Neil said. “Interacting with people from the same background...helps [our children] connect with their Chinese culture that we don’t really know about.”
Michelle C. Sterk, mother of another Dumpling Playgroup participant, added, “China Care allows them to have a sister program that will support them as they grow up.”
Admission to Sunday’s carnival, which included activities like Twister games and treatments at a makeshift nail salon, was free, but the event raised money through the sale of raffle tickets and t-shirts. Attendees were also encouraged to give donations to help fund TianLe’s surgery.
Student groups, including the Asian American Dance Troupe, Din & Tonics, Magicians’ Society, and Wushu, gave volunteer performances at the carnival.

MSNBC broadcaster Rachel Maddow took a critical look at America’s state of perpetual war in a discussion of her recently published book, “Drift: The Unmooring of American Military Power” sponsored by the Harvard Book Store Sunday afternoon.
The book—Maddow’s first—explores the evolution of the military’s role after the Vietnam War. In this post-Vietnam era, Maddow argued, the government began to shield Americans from understanding the true cost of war in an effort to sidestep national debate.
The historically unprecedented mix of tax cuts and long wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, Maddow said, are “not the actions of a country that believes it is at war.”
This phenomenon, she continued, was due in large part to the unilateral decision-making of President George W. Bush’s administration.
“Presidents aren’t supposed to wage war on their own,” Maddow said in front of a packed crowd at the First Parish Church in Cambridge. “It’s supposed to be the Congress that makes the decision, and a nice by-product of Congress making the decision is that the debate is out loud and engages the public necessarily. It also makes you have a better debate because you have to win the argument.”
The founding fathers, Maddow continued, designed the Constitution in a way that forced politicians to engage in this sort of public debate.
“It’s not slowing it down for the sake of slowing it down,” Maddow said. “It’s so bad arguments get ferreted out.”
According to Maddow, much of the expansion of presidential power has its roots in the 1986 Iran-Contra affair. To boost public support after the scandal, Maddow said, the Reagan administration adopted the principle that—in a paraphrased version of Nixon’s words—“if the president does it and it’s vaguely related to national security, then it’s not illegal.”
The mantra, she continued “became not just a weird outlier of bizarre legal theory to try to save a president in trouble—it became a template for a new idea of the presidency.”
In a subtle jab, Maddow dedicated her book to former Vice President Dick Cheney, who she said played a large role in the Bush-era effort to downsize Americans’ understanding of the war.
“I can’t think of anything else that might convince him to consent to an interview with me,” she said with a smile.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BOSTON—Pacing back and forth beside a large wooden podium and gazing out at a lecture hall filled with college students, Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren seemed right at home Saturday. However, the students were not really her own and the lecture was closer to “Politics 101” than “Introduction to Contracts” during the senatorial candidate’s keynote address at the College Democrats of Massachusetts’ annual convention.
“What the experience with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau taught me is, it’s true that that power is there, but we have something that’s stronger and more powerful, and that is we have all of us,” Warren told the crowd.
One hundred and fifty-six students from 22 colleges and universities around the state, including a half-dozen from Harvard, attended the convention at Emerson College, where they heard speeches from Democratic Congressional candidate Joseph P. Kennedy III among others.
In a roughly 16-minute speech that focused on her own middle-class upbringing and work in Washington, Warren laid out the now-familiar terms of her candidacy. But rather than stopping there, she was not shy about making a direct connection to students, a demographic the Harvard Law School professor should know well.
“I’m here today with a very naked, a very open plea,” Warren said. “My plea is: Please, please be part of this Senate race,” Warren told the crowd, later adding “This is how this works. I want to go to Washington so that I can have your back, to make that happen I need you to have my back.”
And indeed, it seems students do have her back, at least those who attended this weekend’s convention. Introduced as the candidate “who has awoken the passion of our generation,” Warren drew great applause and spent nearly a quarter of an hour shaking hands and taking pictures with enthusiastic supporters after her speech. For some students, the theoretical inheritors of the broken future Warren speaks against, the candidate’s own story and dedication to issues like student loan reform and credit reform hit close to home.
“She’s talking about how she grew up in Oklahoma, she went to public schools, public college, public law school, and it’s like—not to say that I don’t appreciate leaders that go to the best schools—but I think that she has this really genuine message of wanting to help those people that grew up like her,” said Emerson College student Samm Leska, one of the organizers of the convention. “I think she’s a fighter.”
“She is definitely a very smart woman, but not the usual politician, which I think draws people to her,” said Boston College student Ali Roth, who volunteers for Warren’s campaign.
College students have been a key demographic for Warren’s campaign since it began last fall. In any race, young people often bear the brunt of responsibility for door-to-door canvassing and phone banking, but the Harvard Law School professor’s own candidacy has been particularly bolstered by the organizational and logistical support of students who have volunteered or interned with the campaign.
“Students own a part of this campaign. And it is their energy, their heart in this campaign that really makes it run,” Warren said in an interview.
A day after Warren addressed college Democrats, a Boston Globe poll released Sunday showed Senator Scott Brown leading Warren by just two points, 37 to 35, with 26 percent of voters saying they were undecided. The slim lead is well within the margin of error and amounts to a statistical tie, confirming what poll after poll has suggested: The race for U.S. Senate is far from over.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 2, 2012, at 3:59 a.m.
More than 40 military veterans, Harvard undergraduates, and local community members participated in a five kilometer race on Saturday to honor Marine scout sniper Clay W. Hunt, who advocated for veterans’ rights and struggled personally with post-traumatic stress disorder. Hunt committed suicide in March 2011.
The 5K was co-sponsored by Harvard College Veterans Engagement Initiative and Team Rubicon—a veterans service organization that Hunt helped to found. According to Levi Briscoe, New England Coordinator of Team Rubicon, the “RUN AS ONE” races were designed to create a sense of community among U.S. veterans.
“[Team Rubicon] gives Marines a place to come home to,” Briscoe continued, especially for soldiers who find it difficult to transition back to civilian life.
Robert L. Schneider ’13, HCVEI's project leader for the event, gave words of encouragement at the starting line before sending the runners around the Harvard Stadium, down the Charles River, and back.
Race participants were given the option of donating to Team Rubicon in honor of an individual of choice. The final tally came in at $2,045.
HCVEI Project Coordinator Sean E. Kesluk ’14 said that when he heard of “RUN AS ONE,” he jumped at the opportunity, reaching out to Team Rubicon to ask if they could hold a race on Harvard’s campus.
With the return of Harvard’s Army and Naval ROTC programs this past year, the armed services have been the focus of campus discussion as Harvard aims to repair its ties with the military.
“There certainly has been a stigma against veterans within the Harvard community,” Kesluk said, “but any school or community could significantly benefit from increased service.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: April 2
An earlier version of this article referred to Robert L. Schneider ’13 as the president of the Harvard College Veterans Engagement Initiative. In fact, he was the project leader for the RUN AS ONE race co-sponsored by the organization.

In addition to the previously revealed YardFest performers The Cataracs and Das Racist, mash-up artist 3LAU and student motown and soul band The Nostalgics will perform at this year’s spring concert, the College Events Board announced on Friday.
The concert will return to its historic location in Tercentenary Theatre.
The artists were chosen based on a public poll distributed to House lists during the fall semester.
In the survey, students gave preferences for artists and genre of music.
According to Robert M. Hero ’13, a member of the YardFest selection committee, the most requested genres were Top 40 and hip-hop.
“Jay-Z and Kanye West were way more expensive than what we could afford,” Hero said. “It’s hard to appease everyone while working on a budget.”
J. Andre Mauri ’13, co-chair of the College Events Board, said he is happy with the lineup given the budgetary and scheduling constraints.
“YardFest is one of our favorite events because it brings school spirit and gets all years [of students] united,” he said.
The Cataracs, a hip-hop indie-pop duo based in Los Angeles, will be the headline artist at YardFest.
The group was formed in 2003 when high school friends David “Campa” Benjamin Singer-Vine and Nyles “Cyrano” Hollowell-Dhar joined forces. After releasing their first album in 2006, their most popular hits have included “Top of the World,” “Club Love,” and “Baby Baby,” the last of which was featured on “Keeping Up With the Kardashians.”
Das Racist, an alternative hip-hop group based in Brooklyn, N.Y., will also perform.
The group emerged as internet celebrities in 2008 after releasing their song, “Combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.”
Their most popular songs include “Hahahaha JK?” and “Girl.”
The third artist, 3LAU, is a 21-year-old mash-up, remix, and House producer, who is also a student at Washington University in St. Louis.
Currently the official House DJ of FratMusic.com, 3LAU has produced hits like “Girls Who Save the World,” “Dubsex,” “Yacht Week in America,” and “All Night Long.”
YardFest will feature a Harvard student band as an opening act for the first time, following the CEB’s mission of encouraging student involvement in social events on campus, according to Mauri.
“We wanted to draw more attention to YardFest by having the students participate and take ownership of the event,” Mauri said.
Friday night, the CEB hosted “Battle for YardFest,” a competition that determined which student group would perform. The CEB has hosted several “Battles” in the past.
The Nostalgics, which is composed of Harvard undergraduates, emerged victorious.
“We were totally surprised and felt pretty flattered,” band member Charles G. Gertler ’13 said. “This will be one of the biggest venues that we play in, so we are very excited.”
In preparation for YardFest, Gertler said the group is “definitely going to try to learn and write new tunes” and adapt its music for the venue.
“Our fans, if we have any, should be excited about hearing us with a really well-mixed sound system and professional sound people behind us,” Gertler said.
Formed in the spring of 2010, The Nostalgics features students from each class.
The band describes itself as “the soul of Harvard University,” according to its website.
In the fall, the Nostalgics performed at the inter-house formal at House of Blues after winning a battle of the bands contest.

New research from the Harvard School of Public Health suggests that routine mammography screenings may lead to a significant amount of overdiagnosis of invasive breast cancer. Generally viewed as an important tool in detecting breast cancer, mammography screening was found to overdiagnose between 15 to 25 percent of breast cancer cases.
The research was based on data gathered from nearly 40,000 women with invasive breast cancer in Norway. Researchers compared the number of breast cancer cases reported in women who had been offered screening with those who were not offered screening.
“The implications are that you really have to think through whether you want to go to the screening or not,” said Mette Kalager, the study’s lead author and a visiting scientist at the School of Public Health.
Kalager, who comes to Harvard from her post as a researcher at the Telemark Hospital in Norway, said that the positive effects of mammography screenings may also be overestimated, as many women are unaware that the harms may actually outweigh the benefits.
Based off the study, Kalager estimated that for every 2,500 women, only one death from breast cancer will be prevented whereas six to ten women will be overdiagnosed and treated with surgery, radiation therapy, and possibly chemotherapy without any benefit.
“There clearly is a benefit for a certain age group [women aged 50-69], but there are also certain harms which I think is true of any type of screening process,” said Rulla M. Tamimi, senior author of the study and an associate professor at the Harvard Medical School. “We haven’t done a good job with educating women about what the harms are.”
Tamimi, a School of Public Health graduate, said that though mammography has existed for a number of years, there have not been many improvements in terms of breast cancer screening.
“Ultimately, better tools are needed to reliably identify which breast cancer will be fatal without treatment and which can be safely observed over time without intervention,” read an editorial published alongside the study.
The study and editorial—which was written by Suzanne W. Fletcher, professor at the Medical School, and Joann G. Elmore, a professor of Epidemiology at the University of Washington School of Medicine—were published in the April 3 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine.
In the editorial, Fletcher and Elmore noted that two factors may suggest that estimates of overdiagnosis from Norway may not necessarily generalize to the United States. They also noted that U.S. radiologists are more likely than their European counterparts to report abnormalities found on mammograms and that U.S. women generally start annual mammography screening at age 40, while Norwegian women start biannual screening at age 50.
“We have an ethical responsibility to alert women to this phenomenon,” Fletcher and Elmore said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the rate Jeff Cohen was going on Saturday afternoon, even a real Wolverine would not have been of much help to the Michigan defense.
The senior attackman had a career day against the Wolverines, scoring seven goals and recording eight points to lead the Harvard men’s lacrosse team to an 11-6 win at Harvard Stadium. With the performance, Cohen moved within two goals of the Crimson’s all-time scoring record, held by David Bohn ’60.
“He’s been shooting the ball really well,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “He did a good job today getting open, getting in the right spots, and putting the ball in the right spots.”
After Michigan (1-9) got on the board first, Cohen responded with two quick scores to give the Crimson (5-4, 2-0 Ivy) the lead.
At the 5:38 mark of the opening frame, the senior cut left from behind the net and put the ball past Michigan goalie Emil Weiss. Thirty seconds later, Cohen added another goal off an assist from junior Jack Walker.
Harvard continued to fire on all cylinders as the quarter wore on. At the 3:36 mark, sophomore attackman Daniel Eipp came from behind the net and beat Weiss with a ground-ball shot. Two minutes later, tri-captain Terry White took a long cross-field pass from Cohen and fired a high shot over Weiss’ shoulder. Just 14 seconds after that, Eipp took a pass in front of the net from freshman Sean Mahon, beat his man right, and scored to put Harvard up, 5-1, after one.
“We gave up one [goal], but we answered the bell,” Wojcik said. “We came right back and were really sharp on offense.... I was happy with how we responded after they scored initially.”
Cohen earned a hat trick 1:18 into the second, spinning in front of the net and scoring on a ground-ball shot despite tripping. After Michigan’s Trevor Yealy added a man-up goal moments later to cut the Harvard lead to 6-2, Eipp hit Cohen in front of the goalie box, giving the senior a great look for his fourth goal of the day.
“We were moving the ball [well], and that generated shots,” Cohen said. “When we move the ball quickly, we can get good looks on the backside.”
Michigan made a run early in the third to get back in the game. Less than two minutes into the period, Doug Bryant beat his defender, senior midfielder Mark Scalise, to the right before beating freshman goaltender Jake Gambitsky. Two minutes later, Thomas Paras scored of a cross-field assist to cut the Harvard lead to 7-4.
But from there, Cohen went back to work. At the 9:28 mark, he took a pass from tri-captain Kevin Vaughan, juked out his defender, and beat Weiss to the left side of the net for a man-up goal. He scored again from five yards out off an Eipp pass 76 seconds later, and—following another Michigan penalty—scored his third goal in under two minutes off an assist from freshman Will Walker.
“[Cohen’s] just confident,” Wojcik said. “He’s shooting it well and he’s helping our offense and our team finish plays.”
David McCormack and Yealy responded with scores for Michigan to cut the Harvard lead to 10-6 heading into the fourth.
In the final period, Cohen—needing two goals to tie the Harvard and four to tie the NCAA single-game scoring record—was unable to get on the board.
But junior midfielder Ryan Stevens picked up the slack less than two minutes into the quarter, taking a cross-field pass from sophomore Carl Zimmerman and beating Weiss from the left. Paras added his second goal of the game midway through the period to make the score 11-7, where it would stay.
Led by Cohen’s 13 attempts, the Crimson outshot the Wolverines, 40-32. The Harvard defense forced 22 Michigan turnovers, while Gambitsky finished with 10 saves.
“Jake’s playing better each game,” Wojcik said. “He’s continuing to improve and our defense is doing a good job limiting the high-percentage shots he sees.”
The Crimson victory continued a rough opening season for Michigan, which is playing lacrosse at the varsity level for the first time.
“It was at times a little sloppy,” Wojcik said. “We did some good things offensively and defensively [and] had a couple mental errors here and there that allowed them to stay in the game, but Michigan did a really good job capitalizing... Credit to them for hanging in there. It was a tight game throughout.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a road trip to the nation’s capital, Harvard women’s water polo picked up two decisive wins over Mercyhurst and George Washington, 10-4 and 18-12, respectively, in a Saturday doubleheader at George Washington University.
The two wins clinched a No. 2 seed for the Crimson in the CWPA Southern Division Championship.
“These were two crucial games to win,” senior attacker Shannon Purcell said. “We’re heading into the Southern Division tournament in second place, and if we had lost to either or both of these teams, we would have received a lower seed.”
After this weekend, the Crimson (12-9, 4-1 CWPA) will play No. 19 Hartwick in its last home game of the season before traevling to compete in the CWPA Southern Division Championship and the CWPA Eastern Championship.
“This is the part of the season that really matters,” senior two-meter Devan Kennifer said. “I don’t think we are going to do anything much different but rather try to find our weaknesses and clean them up before we play in the games that matter.”
HARVARD 18, GEORGE WASHINGTON 12
The second game of the doubleheader played out to a different, more offensive tune.
The Crimson’s 18 goals were the most the team has scored since an April 2 contest at Connecticut College last season.
Capitalizing on a shorter, shallower pool, Harvard played spoiler on George Washington’s (8-10, 1-4) Senior Day.
“A lot of [our success] had to do with the fact that we were playing in a shallow-deep pool, and it was only 25 yards long,” Purcell said. “We saw areas that they were dropping back, and we attacked from there.”
Harvard scored at least five goals in three frames, and a variety of players found the back of the net for the Crimson.
Junior attacker Aisha Price, senior attacker Lizzie Abbott, and Kennifer each scored four goals against the Colonials. Purcell added three scores of her own.
Harvard was able to get a variety of looks at the goal from outside and in 6-on-5 situations.
“There was a lot of outside shooting,” Purcell said. “Our 6-on-5 was really good that game. We made really good reads. We also had a lot of great shots out of set.”
While Harvard controlled the offensive tempo for the majority of this game, George Washington was able to narrow the lead to a couple scores in the third frame and wake up the large crowd of Colonial fans.
“The fans were thunderously loud,” Kennifer said. “The room that the pool was in is small and causes sound to echo. We basically couldn’t hear very much at all so we had to communicate more than we usually do with each other.”
But Harvard was able to pull away in the fourth behind another double-digit save game from freshman goalie Ariel Dukes.
HARVARD 10, MERCYHURST 4
In the first game of the doubleheader, the Crimson rode a strong defensive effort to a 10-4 victory over the Lakers.
Harvard jumped out to an early 4-0 lead in the first frame. Sophomore attacker Shayna Price, also a Crimson sports comper, found the back of the net two times within the first three minutes to put pressure on the Mercyhurst (7-14, 0-5) defense. Kennifer and senior attacker Monica Zdrojewski both added goals in the first frame to further widen the lead.
Zdrojewski, who scored again in the second and third periods for her fifth hat trick of the season, led the Crimson with three goals. Shayna Price and Kennifer chipped in two goals apiece.
While six Harvard players contributed goals to pace the Crimson offensively, seven players contributed two or more steals to set the tone defensively.
As the team did in its second contest of the doubleheader, Harvard again took advantage of the smaller pool to aggressively defend the passing lanes and force many Lakers turnovers.
“Basically, there’s no counter in the game [with the smaller pool],” Purcell said. “You have to be up in the lanes on defense. We just capitalized on that, and we pressed them really hard, and we were able to make those steals.”
Kennifer finished with five steals and Frager with four to lead the Crimson. As a team, Harvard tallied 24 steals, a season high, to hold Mercyhurst to four goals.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The talent, it seems, is there for the Harvard women’s lacrosse team. The consistency, however, is still a work in progress.
Taking on No. 2 Syracuse Saturday afternoon at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Mass., the Crimson hung with its opponent for the second half, matching Syracuse, 4-4, in the frame.
But Harvard (4-5, 1-2 Ivy) was unable to recover from an early first-half deficit, falling to the Orange, 10-6.
“We played well in moments,” said co-captain Melanie Baskind, whose squad trailed Syracuse 6-2 at halftime. “They’re the No. 2 team in the country, and we proved we can play with them.”
While the Crimson struggled finding the back of the net—Harvard’s six goals matched its second lowest offensive output of the year—Baskind shined individually, totaling three goals on eight shots and two assists.
“Syracuse had a solid defense, but Mel challenged, and she found great opportunities, and she finished on them,” co-captain Ellen Gleason said. “That’s exactly what we needed.”
But Baskind’s strong offensive performance was not enough for the Crimson to overcome a talented Orange (6-2, 1-0 Big East) squad currently riding a five-game winning streak.
Syracuse, which received a game-high four scores from Alyssa Murray and three from Katie Webster, used its speed and transition offense to take control of the contest.
“I think what really stood out with them that we haven’t seen so much in other teams was how effective they are in transition,” Baskind said. “The speed at which they were moving the ball and connecting with each other, I don’t think we’ve seen that from a team yet this season.”
While the Crimson adjusted to the heightened pace, Syracuse took advantage, grabbing the 1-0 lead off a Sarah Holden score 5:17 into play. Harvard sophomore Jenn Leffew answered with a goal off a pass from Baskind to even the game at 1-1.
But the Orange responded with a 5-0 run over a 10:06 stretch to take a commanding 6-1 lead with 3:06 to play. Murray and Webster fueled the Syracuse run with a combined three goals and an assist.
Taking it to the net on her own, Murray scored the visitors’ second goal, and Webster followed 63 seconds later with her second score of the afternoon. Murray found Kailah Kempney for her first goal with 6:23 to play to put Syracuse up, 4-1.
Webster and Becca Block each beat freshman goalkeeper Kelly Weiss (seven saves, 10 goals allowed) over the next three minutes.
“[Syracuse’s transition play] was something we struggled with in the first half,” Baskind said.
Sophomore attacker Chelsey Newman put an end to the Orange run with a score 18 seconds before the end of the period to pull the Crimson within four, 6-2, heading into the break.
The second half was a different story. Baskind set the tone 3:10 in with her first score of the night, an unassisted shot past Orange goalie Kelsey Richardson (two saves, four goals allowed), who replaced Alyssa Costantino (six saves, two goals allowed) at the half.
Sixty-six seconds later, Murray put Syracuse back up by four with a free-position score, but Baskind responded with back-to-back goals over a 29-second stretch to cut the Orange’s led to two, 7-5, with 22:02 to go.
“We did do a good job slowing them down in the second half,” Baskind said. “That’s something that I look back on and I’m pretty pleased with.”
But pulling within two was as close as the Crimson got, as Webster beat Weiss on the ensuing Syracuse possession. Murray put the visitors up four with 15:27 to go, and the Orange finished out the game with a 10-6 win.
“We didn’t put our best effort forward,” Gleason said. “We could have definitely made it a closer game.”
Saturday’s Harvard-Syracuse matchup marked the first women’s collegiate sporting event to take place at Gillette Stadium, home of the NFL’s New England Patriots and the MLS’s New England Revolution.
“It was a great opportunity,” Gleason said. “I think our team really enjoyed it. Wish we had come away with a win though—that would have made it even better.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While the Harvard track and field team divided over the weekend, the conquering didn’t come quite as easily.
Some members of the squad headed to the Sunshine State to compete in the North Florida Invitational against some of the nation’s elite teams, only managing one win, while others stayed closer to campus and took care of business at the Tufts Snowflake Classic.
NORTH FLORIDA INVITATIONAL
Harvard was up against some of the nation’s best track and field teams at the North Florida Invitational in Jacksonville, Fla. The squad was pitted against a field that included Auburn University, the University of South Carolina, and Florida State University, and the University of Virginia.
“It was intimidating at first...but it’s kind of cool being the underdogs,” freshman Erika Veidis said.
The Crimson embraced its role as the underdog and was able to notch a number of top-five performances, including some personal records.
Junior Nico Weiler earned Harvard’s only event win of the meet in the pole vault. Weiler cleared 5.30 meters, a mark just shy of the school record, to take home the victory.
But Weiler wasn’t the Crimson’s only field athlete who impressed at the meet.
In his first collegiate meet, Freshman Dean Sullivan finished in third place in the javelin with a heave of 67.00 meters. The rookie’s mark is the second best in school history.
While most members of the Harvard squad had the entire indoor season to compete in their respective events, Sullivan and the team’s other javelin throwers are just beginning to see competition, as the javelin throw is limited to outdoor track.
“Dean is doing a great job of listening to [throwing coach Cathrine Grace Erickson],” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “His throw was better than he threw in high school by about a meter. There’s still quite a bit to work on, but I’m excited about what’s to come for him.”
On the women’s side, senior Kailyn Kuzmuk posted the best performance of her career in the 1500m run. Following a rough start to the race, Kuzmuk was able to make her way up to the front of the pack and finish in third place with a personal-best time of 4:26.05. The veteran’s time ranks fifth all time for the Crimson.
“[Kuzmuk] ran like a seasoned veteran,” Saretsky said. “I was thrilled with way she competed.”
Florida State was otherwise dominant in the women’s 1500, placing four runners in the top seven spots with senior Violah Lagat taking first.
The Crimson women did its best to steal a page from the Seminoles’ book in the 800m run. Veidis and fellow first-year Molly Renfer, as well as senior Meghan Looney all finished in the top seven places in the event. The trio finished in third, sixth, and seventh places, respectively.
“The race was incredibly daunting at first,” Veidis said. “I was thinking to myself, ‘Oh my gosh, are you going to be able to run these two laps?’ I hadn’t run an 800 since January, and I’m dealing with minor injuries…so I wasn’t expecting all that much. I really surprised myself.”
The invitational was hosted by North Florida University. Harvard will return to the venue later in the season for nationals.
TUFTS SNOWFLAKE CLASSIC
While their teammates were soaking up the sun and competing against a few of the nation’s perennial track and field powerhouses, some members of the track and field squad remained in chilly Massachusetts to take on some regional competition.
The Crimson flexed its muscle against the meet’s weaker field, tallying up a number of event wins.
Senior John Dingus topped the competition in the 400m dash, cruising to victory with a time of 50.28 seconds.
“John’s a great competitor,” Saretsky said. “He’s in great shape, and I think he has more success ahead of him. As season progresses and he gets in more competitions, I think we’re going to see his times drop even lower.”
For the Harvard women, the distance runners showed that they will be a force to be reckoned with down the stretch this season. Sophomore Morgan Kelly, freshman Viviana Hanley, and senior Kirsten Jorgensen took the top three places, respectively, in the 5000m run. Kelly’s time of 17:28.53 earned her the event win, with Hanley less than a second behind her.
“I think [the weekend] went really well for us,” Saretsky said. “We had a number of outstanding performances. There’s a bit of an extra challenge when you’re competing in two places, but I was very pleased with how our student-athletes went out and competed.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 13 Radcliffe heavyweight crew’s racing results on Saturday proved to be as mixed as the day’s weather. Though the Black and White 1V was unable to take down the defending national champions No. 7 Brown, the Radcliffe heavyweight crew took three of four races for the day.
“It was a good start to the dual-meet season,” junior Celia Kohl said. “I think that there is a lot of build off of, but I think in general we had a strong performance.”
“Brown did win the NCAA Championship last year, so the way that we see it, since there are three qualifying NCAA boats and we won two out of those three races, this past weekend was a Radcliffe win over Brown,” junior coxswain Jorie Sullivan said. “Although we are all looking for more speed with our 1V boat, we are still pleased with our overall results.”
In the marquee varsity eight race, the Bears emerged victorious edging out the Black and White in a highly competitive race by 3.4 seconds. With Brown’s 1V victory, Radcliffe suffered its first varsity defeat of the season, dropping to 4-1 on the year, while the Bears tallied their first of the season, improving to 1-2.
Both boats were rather evenly matched for the first half of the race. But in the final 500 meters, Brown’s pace proved too much for the Black and White to keep up with, and the Bears began to pull away, leading by a length ahead in the final meters of the race.
Brown finished the varsity eight race in 6:16.0, 3.4 seconds ahead of Radcliffe, which crossed the line in 6:19.4.
Despite the close loss to the Bears in the varsity eight race, the Black and White blanked Brown in the three other matchups. In the second varsity eight, third and fourth varsity eight, and the varsity fours, Radcliffe finished with comfortable victories.
In the second varsity eight race, The Black and White began the race in the lead and stayed ahead the entire 2000 meters. In the final stretch, Brown was able to push back, but Radcliffe was too far ahead at that point to give the Bears a chance at victory. The Black and White 2V finished the course in 6:27.5, a 5.6 second victory over Brown.
In the 3&4V race, the third varsity eight finished first in 6:51.5, nearly three seconds ahead of Black and White 4V (6:54.4) and nearly five seconds before last place Brown (6:56.4)
The Radcliffe varsity four ended the afternoon dual meet with a victory over the Brown varsity four in  7:10.4, a 6.1 second victory over the Bears who finished in 7:16.5.
“I think that it is awesome to see the amount of depth that we have on this team this year,” Kohl said. “I think that it is something that is going to be a key factor of our performance for the rest of the season. It’s one thing to have a strong top-level boat, but when you have strong performers and strong racers all the way down to the 4V, that is what’s really going to drive us forward this spring.”
After taking on Brown this past weekend, the Black and White will line up against Ivy foes Columbia, Cornell, and Princeton in the Class of 1975 Cup.
“Princeton and Brown have already raced each other two weekends ago, and Princeton beat Brown by a boat length in the 1V,” Sullivan said. “When we race them, it should be an interesting matchup. I think that going up against Princeton will be our opportunity to re-prove ourselves and showcase our speed.”

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: April 8
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that in the women's heavyweight crew race on March 31, Radcliffe held a slight lead over Brown halfway through the race and that the two teams entered the final stretch very close to one another. In fact, Brown and Radcliffe were neck-and-neck midway through the 2,000-meter race, but in the third 500, Brown opened a sizable lead to win by a length. In addition, the article incorrectly stated that a gun signaled the start of the race. In fact, rowing races do not use guns as signals.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite entering the first weekend of Ivy play with just two wins under its belt, the Harvard baseball team came out strong, earning a 6-2 victory over Cornell on Saturday in the weekend’s first matchup. But the Crimson went on to drop its next three contests, beginning with a defeat at the hands of the Big Red in the second game of its first doubleheader, 12-7.
Princeton swept Harvard on Sunday by scores of 12-6 and 4-1, respectively, to round out another tough weekend on the road for the Crimson.
“Because it was our first Ivy League weekend, we really wanted to make a statement in [the first] game,” said sophomore first baseman Steven Dill. “The first game of Ivy season is always huge.”
The Crimson bats came alive in both matchups against Cornell, and the team outhit its Big Red counterparts, 22-17, for a total of 13 runs on the day.
“We really haven’t had too many offensive struggles this year,” said junior third baseman Kyle Larrow. “Our bats have been going every game, which is good as far as keeping us in the game…. From a building standpoint, hitting is something we’re going to try to ride in Ivy League series and hopefully get a lot of wins.”
After Harvard’s lengthy roadtrip from Ithaca to Princeton, the Tigers outhit the Crimson (3-19, 1-3 Ivy), 16-12, on Sunday, as junior captain Andrew Ferreira and freshman Tanner Anderson picked up losses on the mound for the Crimson.
But despite the losses, the team remains positive about its chances as it enters the heat of Ivy season.
“I feel pretty good about our team after this weekend,” freshman centerfielder Mike Martin said. “The games we were losing, I felt we weren’t being outmatched. We were just not executing up to our potential. Wins will come once we start stringing hits together.”
PRINCETON 12, HARVARD 6
For the third time on the weekend, Harvard took an early lead over one of its Ancient Eight rivals. But Princeton (9-10, 3-1) scoring streaks quickly shifted the tide in favor of the Tigers.
“We got a lot of hits off of [Princeton pitcher Kevin Link]. We just couldn’t string them together,” Martin said.
Sophomore left fielder Jack Colton got Harvard on the board in the second inning, scoring on classmate Jake McGuiggan’s sacrifice fly.
But Princeton responded in the bottom half of the second. After third baseman Sam Mulroy was hit by a pitch, back-to-back RBI hits gave the Tigers the 2-1 edge.
Senior second baseman Jeff Reynolds hit his second home run of the weekend in the third inning, and Martin also hit one out of the park in the ninth, sending home three runners. But Princeton’s five-run sixth quieted any Harvard hopes of a comeback.
“We gave them a lot of 3-1 counts,” Martin said. “And they went up there and hit doubles and triples.”
PRINCETON 4, HARVARD 1
Princeton jumped out of the gate in the first contest between the two teams, picking up three runs in the fourth inning on a wild pitch, a walk, and a single from Tigers right fielder Alec Keller.
In the sixth inning, Princeton added its fourth and final run of the game, as second baseman Alex Flink batted in fellow infielder Jonathan York.
Senior catcher John Smart earned Harvard’s lone RBI of the game, sending home freshman right fielder Zach Boden with a single to right field in the seventh. But that was as close as the Crimson would get in the 4-1 loss to the Tigers.
“In the first game [of the series], we faced a pretty good pitcher [in Princeton’s Matt Bowman],” Martin said. “He pretty much shut us down.”
CORNELL 12, HARVARD 7
Although Harvard amassed a six-run lead in Saturday’s second contest, scoring five runs in the first two innings, Cornell (15-5-1, 2-1) tied up the game with a six-run effort in the bottom of the fifth. The Big Red took the lead one inning later, plating three runners in the sixth frame. Harvard failed to recover from the deficit.
“The second game [on Saturday] slipped through our fingertips,” said senior left-handed pitcher Brent Suter. “I thought we should have taken two from them [on Saturday].”
Harvard threatened in the eighth inning, as freshman catcher Ethan Ferreira batted in Boden on a single down the first base line. But while Boden’s score put the game within reach, 9-7, Cornell scored three more in the bottom of the eighth to put the contest out of reach.
“We just gave them too many good pitches to hit,” Suter said. “We fell behind from a pitching standpoint. Our offense put enough runs up to win the game…. We let things that were in our control slip a bit.”
Dill led the Crimson with four hits in as many at bats on the game, while sophomore right fielder Zach Boden scored two runs for the Crimson.
Cornell second baseman Brenton Peters cleared the bases with a three-run triple in the eighth inning to seal Harvard’s fate. The middle infielder led his team with four RBIs in the game.
“It was definitely disappointing to have them score those late runs in such a close game,” Dill said. “But that happens sometimes. They just put bat on ball and drove it.”
HARVARD 6, CORNELL 2
In its Ivy League season opener, the Crimson took a two-run lead in the first inning, as senior designated hitter Marcus Way batted in sophomore shortstop Carlton Bailey.  Later that same inning, Way scored a run of his own, unearned, on a single from sophomore outfielder Jack Colton.
But unlike in its second game of the day, Harvard was able to hold on to the early lead, allowing just two runs over the course of seven innings.
“We were plugged in, both on defense and on offense,” Suter said. “It was a good, complete team win.”
Harvard struck again in the fourth inning, as Smart’s sacrifice fly scored Boden, giving the Crimson its second unearned run of the day.
“We came out strong,” Dill said. “There are definitely a lot of positives to build on. Our hitting was good, our defense was very good and our pitching.”
In the fifth inning, Colton batted in Way with a single. The Crimson stretched its lead to 6-1 in the sixth inning, as Martin and Smart each scored runs on RBIs from Smart and Way, respectively.
“The first game was huge for us,” Larrow said. “We were able to get the lead early and held onto it, which was really big…. It’s nice to come out hot in the first game [of Ivy play] and get runs on the board well.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When all the serves were completed, volleys finished, and shots hit, the Harvard men’s tennis team completed its weekend with a sweep as well as its 11th and 12th consecutive wins. On Friday and Sunday afternoons, the Crimson defeated Binghamton (7-11), 7-0, and St. John’s (15-6), 5-2, respectively, at the Murr  Center.
“It was a good weekend,” junior Andy Ngyuen said. “It made us feel confident coming into the Ivy League, but it also humbled us. We realized that there are really good teams out there, and the rest of the season, with Ivies, isn’t going to be any different.”
HARVARD 5, ST. JOHN’S 2
Playing its first outdoor match of the season, Harvard (16-1) found itself in a close, even match with the Red Storm from the first point to the closing shot.
“St. John’s came out ready,” freshman Shaun Chaudhuri said. “They were fighting really hard and a lot of us went into the third set. It was definitely a battle out there, and we’re just happy to be able to pull through.”
Afte winning the doubles point, the struggles began for the home team and it quickly found itself down in four out of six matches. But three hours into the match brought something unexpected—rain.
The weather forced the remainder of the games to be played inside. Only freshman Denis Nguyen’s match, a 6-3, 6-2, win, had been completed before the move occurred.
“Personally, I struggled more in the outside play,” Chaudhuri said. “It’s different playing out there, and I think a lot of our team benefited by coming back indoors. Either way, you’re still playing tennis though.”
Sophomore Christo Schultz’s match was the first to finish in the indoor courts as he fell, 3-6, 6-4, 3-6. Soon after, senior Jonathan Pearlman also fell to St. John’s, 0-6, 7-6, 5-7, after coming back from an 0-6, 1-3, hole.
Fortunately for the Crimson, Chaudhuri pulled off a timely victory and cracked his opponent, 7-5, 3-6, 6-2. Rookies Henry Steer and Alex Steinroeder followed their classmate’s lead, and each finished up their matches with a win. Steer took his match 7-5, 3-6, 6-4, while Steinroeder completed the day with a 4-6, 7-6, 6-2 come-from-behind victory.
HARVARD 7, BINGHAMTON 0
This victory marked Harvard’s fourth sweep of an opponent this spring and its second in 7-0 fashion.
In doubles play, the Crimson took two out of three matches, winning on the No. 2 and 3 courts while undergoing its only loss of the day in the No. 1 spot.
While co-captain Alistair Felton and sophomore Casey MacMaster were defeated by their Bearcat counterparts, 9-7, Pearlman and Schultz handily beat their competition, 8-2. To earn the doubles point, the Nguyen brothers underwent a lengthy match, ultimately resulting in a 9-8 win.
“[Denis Nguyen and I] have been trying to play with more energy and not worry about anything,” Andy Nugyen said. “We had to play a really long point, come back, and save a match point, but we’re a great pair and have done well so far this season, so we knew that if we just played freely we would continue our ways.”
Harvard had even more success in singles play.
The team was victorious all six of its matches and went to three sets only once.
Steer won his match, 6-2, 6-4, while Steinroeder took care of his opponent, 6-4, 6-2.
Pearlman, coming off of his doubles victory, had no problem in the No. 1 position and finished his sets, 6-2, 7-5. Denis Nguyen, also playing only minutes after his last match, quickly wrapped up his second appearance of the day, 6-3, 6-1. Schultz continued his unbeaten spring season when he won 7-5, 6-0, and Chaudhuri concluded the day’s work for the Crimson when he finished up his match 6-4, 1-6, 6-1.
For Harvard, this weekend’s set of matches was viewed as a jumping-off point for Ivy play.
“We’re going to just stay confident,” Nguyen said. “We know that pretty much all the Ivy teams are going to be gunning for us, so we can’t play reserved. We have something to lose. We have to still go after it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite splitting its opening Ivy League series with Cornell on Friday, the Harvard softball team (15-8, 3-1 Ivy) bounced back to sweep Princeton (5-18, 2-2) on Saturday at the Class of 1895 Field in Princeton, N.J.
The Crimson took down the Tigers, 6-5 and 8-0, respectively, in the doubleheader, moving to a 3-1 record in the conference to keep pace with Cornell (12-11, 3-1).
“The loss against Cornell showed us that every game is going to be tough and that we need all aspects of our game firing at the same time to keep ourselves in every game,” co-captain Rachel Brown said. “We let the loss fire us up for the next day in the games against Princeton.”
With the back-to-back wins over Princeton, the Crimson improves to 15-8, as it moves deeper into its conference schedule.
“We really used the games against Princeton to grow, and to continue to tackle some small goals on the road towards our greater goal of winning Ivies,” co-captain Whitney Shaw said. “The weekend was crucial to build our confidence back up and show…what Harvard softball is capable of this season.”
HARVARD 8, PRINCETON 0
With a tightly contested 6-5 win over Princeton under its belt, Harvard completed the sweep thanks to an offensive outpouring and strength at the mound. Sophomore pitcher Laura Ricciardone recorded six strikeouts in the contest and only allowed one Tigers runner to get past second base.
“[Riccardionne] pitched her heart out in game two,” Shaw said. “She took a team that had just almost come back from a six-run deficit in the first game and shut them out. She showed a lot of fight on the mound.”
It took an inning for the Crimson to get on the board, but in the top of the second, Crimson junior Kassy Shiotani reached home after a wild pitch, giving Harvard a lead it didn’t relinquish for the remainder of the contest.
Following the run in the second inning, junior Ashley Heritage scored on a Princeton error to increase the lead to two. RBI singles from sophomores Kasey Lange and Shelbi Olson gave Harvard the 4-0 advantage.
The seventh inning saw the most offense in the game for the Crimson, which tacked on four more off of another RBI from Lange, an RBI from freshman Katherine Appelbe, and a two-run single from freshman Adrienne Hume. The four runs sealed Harvard’s 8-0 thrashing of the Tigers and its Saturday sweep.
HARVARD 6, PRINCETON 5
Following a tough 10-8 loss to Cornell, Harvard looked poised to take the first game of a doubleheader against Princeton handily, as the visiting Crimson scored four runs in the third inning off of a grand slam off the bat of Shaw.
Senior Jane Alexander widened the lead in the fifth after reaching first on an error, taking second on a steal, and scoring on an RBI single from Lange.
The Tigers didn’t go down easily though, striking back in the bottom of the fifth and closing the lead to two off of a home run from Alex Peyton that plated three Princeton players.
Lange, who had two RBIs in the contest, and Alexander, who finished 3-for-4 with a pair of steals, paired up again for another run in the seventh. With one out, the sophomore hit a sacrifice fly that brought the senior home and gave Harvard the three-run lead.
In the bottom of the final inning, the Tigers drew within one after Cara Worden slammed a two-run single. But Brown was able to end the game from the mound, garnering her 12th strikeout of the game and ninth win of the season.
Offensively, Shaw led the way with a team-high four RBIs. In the win, seven of the Crimson’s starters recorded at least one hit.
“Princeton came out fighting…and we learned that no game is over until the last out is made,” Shaw said. “At any time, the pace of the game can switch to the other team, which is why we need to play…from the top of the first to the bottom of the seventh.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The fans rose to their feet as the Harvard men’s volleyball team delivered its final serve of the evening. To the crowd’s dismay, the Crimson failed to convert the match point.  But the cheers continued until the next serve, when the New Jersey Institute of Technology server sent a ball high and out of bounds, ending the final home game for Harvard co-captains Matt Jones and Dan Schreff.
The Crimson (16-3, 8-2 EIVA) capitalized on strong defensive play to ensure that its seniors left the Malkin Athletic Center with fond, final memories, defeating conference opponent NJIT (10-13, 4-4) in three straight sets. The victory marked Harvard’s fourth win in a row, and the tenth in its last eleven games.
“NJIT is a really good team,” Schreff said.  “It was a really good battle today. What I thought we did well today is our blocking. [Friday night against Rutgers-Newark] we weren’t closing out our blocks, so tonight we got our hands on some of those hard driven balls and allowed our back row to pick up some of those digs. The defense really stepped up tonight.”
It took a while for the home team to find that defensive energy, though, as the Crimson held a slight, 14-13, lead over its opponent late into the first set.  Harvard scored the next three points to stretch its lead to 17-13, but the Highlanders continued to fight. The score stood at 20-16 when the Crimson elicited cheers from the crowd with two blocks. Harvard remained stalwart on defense until it had won the first frame, 25-18.
The Crimson carried that momentum into the second set, jumping out to a commanding 11-3 lead. It looked like Harvard was primed to run away with the lead until Highlanders’ coach Ryan McNeil took what proved to be a crucial timeout.
Whatever McNeil said in the huddle inspired his team, as NJIT came out of the break on a 5-0 run, forcing Crimson coach Brian Baise to call a timeout of his own. Harvard regained its composure in subsequent play, going up, 24-16. But the Highlanders did not give up. Undaunted by its large deficit, the Highlanders scored another five straight points.
The latest NJIT run prompted another timeout for the Crimson. Again, Harvard came out of the huddle strong. The team picked up the final point of the set when Jones recorded one of his team-high 14 kills, ending the frame, 25-16.
“Really, the first two games total were decided by runs,” junior setter Rob Lothman said. “The first game we started off pretty slow and got hot at the end, and the second game we started off hot and got slow at the end. It would be nice to put together a really solid game on the whole and not have a run in the middle like the one we give to the other team.”
The Highlanders came out strong in the third set, taking an early 2-0 lead. The Crimson evened the score and proceeded to take a slight advantage until NJIT tied the game at 12.
Although the Highlanders managed to wrestle back the lead, the home team was not to be denied. Harvard tied the game at 14 and then took the lead, which it would not relinquish. The Crimson went on to win the final set, 25-21.
“It was fun…to get a win in three in front of our home crowd, and it’s a big league win regardless of the day,” Jones said. “It is weird to think that this is the last game I’m going to play in the MAC ever again.”
Schreff shared the sentiment.
“This feels really good,” he said. “The season is going really well, so it’s awesome to close out our homestand with two victories and a strong home crowd.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard men’s heavyweight crew started off its spring season on Saturday by competing on opposite coasts.
The first and second varsity eights traveled to California to compete in the San Diego Crew Classic, a two-day racing event.  Meanwhile, on the East Coast, the third varsity boat and the two freshman boats raced against Cornell.
The Crimson had a successful weekend overall, taking first place in four of five events and putting up a strong, second-place finish in the Sharp Cabrillo Cup.
SAN DIEGO CREW CLASSIC
The first two Harvard varsity boats competed alongside nearly 4000 racers at the San Diego Crew Classic on Saturday and Sunday. The Classic allowed the Crimson to take on its West Coast challengers, UC Berkeley, Stanford and UC Davis, early on in the season.
The outing was a successful one for both boats: The first varsity boat won the Copley Cup in 6:17.88, and the second varsity boat placed second in 6:21.99 behind the Cal A crew.
On Saturday, the 1V qualified for grand finals in 5:55.043.  Harvard led second-place Navy by two seats early on and stretched that lead to almost a boat length by the end of the qualifier.
The Crimson won the Copley Cup title the following morning. Two seats behind Cal, Harvard overtook the Golden Bears near the 1000-meter mark.
“Even though we were down, we were really confident about how we were rowing and started taking seats,” said senior Patrick Lapage, stroke seat of the first varsity eight. “Once we started to boost [our] rhythm, we had done enough to secure the win.”
“It is good to get off to a winning start but there is still a lot of work to do for Sprints and Nationals,” Lapage added. “We are happy with it, but we are going to put it behind us and crack on with it here.”
The second varsity eight also qualified for grand finals on Saturday morning with an open-water victory over Cornell. In the finals of the Sharp Cabrillo Cup, the Cal A crew nearly achieved an open-water lead over Harvard at the start. The Crimson mounted a comeback but was unable to make up the distance.  Harvard finished in second by 2.7 seconds, edging out the Cal B crew, Cornell, Stanford, and UC Davis.
HARVARD VS. CORNELL
Harvard coasted to victory over Cornell, with all three Crimson crews topping their Big Red counterparts on Saturday in Ithaca,  N.Y.
Under a slight headwind, but otherwise mild conditions, the third varsity eight defeated Cornell by a margin of 12.8 seconds. But because of the Crimson’s lane draw, the crew started down and inside of the first and larger of the two turns in the Cornell course.
“After we did our start and high strokes, we found ourselves even because of some of the advantage Cornell was getting from being on the outside of the turn,” said senior David Paresky, third seat of the third varsity eight.
The race remained relatively close throughout the first 500 meters.
“I thought they had a good strong start, and so did we,” said sophomore William Hakim, coxswain of the third varsity eight. “For the first 500 meters, we were both really going at it.”
At around the 500-meter point, the race started to open up in Harvard’s favor.
“We took a push and we really started taking seats,” Hakim said. “We just kept moving and kept our foot on the pedal through the rest of the race.”
Harvard was able to hold on to its lead and defeat the Cornell crew in 6:09.8.
The first and second freshman eights each won their races with times of 6:03.7 and 6:18.4, respectively.  The strong showing at Cornell was important for building momentum for the Crimson right at the start of the season.
“In the past, Cornell has been one of our tougher dual races,” Paresky said. “It was really exciting to get such a big win early in the season.”
Harvard continues its Ivy League matchups with a race against Brown on April 7th in Providence, R.I.
“Last year, the 3V was not able to win [the] Sprints Championship at the end of the season,” Paresky said. “That was a big disappointment for us given that we had gone undefeated in the regular season.  I think the focus this year is just to make sure to get faster so that we can give it our best shot when it comes time for Sprints.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a series of errors gave away the second set, the Harvard men’s volleyball team had seemingly lost all of the momentum it had earned in its first-game victory. But after a lengthy locker room meeting, the Crimson refocused and turned on the jets, cruising to a 3-1 victory against Rutgers-Newark in front of a raucous crowd at the Malkin Athletic  Center Friday night.
Harvard (16-3, 8-2 EIVA) recovered from a second game fraught with attack errors and mental lapses, and the team energy appeared to take a dip. But after the second-game intermission with Harvard coach Brian Baise, the Crimson’s focus seemed resharpened, and the level of play began to reflect that.
“I will say I didn’t think it was our strongest game,” junior setter Rob Lothman said. “But fortunately, we were able to dig deep, Coach [Baise] had a good locker room talk, we built each other up, and we were able to come out in games three and four and really grab some momentum.”
The opening exchanges of the first game were mostly even, with the two teams trading points back and forth. But Harvard was able to engineer some short runs to give itself some breathing space, and behind co-captain Matt Jones’ five kills, the Crimson edged Rutgers-Newark (8-12, 1-9), 25-20.
Harvard looked like the better team going into the second game but soon fell behind, 6-1, as Scarlet Raider Grant Metheny notched three service aces early. The lack of defensive discipline was matched with some Crimson attack errors, and the visitors began to reclaim the momentum.
Lothman believed the mistakes in the second game built upon each other and that the team’s response could have been better.
“We were just making mistakes, getting frustrated,” Rob Lothman said. “It’s true in every sport, but this sport in particular—you need to be able to get over your mistakes quickly…. They just compounded, and when they compound, it’s easy to drop a lot of points in a row.”
Baise added, “Mentally, when we make an error, [we need to] leave that error behind. Sometimes, I think we dwell on our mistakes too much.”
And though Harvard began to find its offensive rhythm, the Crimson could not dent the cushion the Scarlet Raiders had built for themselves. And after Baise’s second timeout of the frame at 17-9, Rutgers-Newark continued piling on, extending its lead to 11 with a 3-0 run.
And though the Crimson eventually dropped the game, the home team grabbed 9 of the frame’s final 14 points and reclaimed some momentum before a brief intermission.
“In the locker room, we really focused on not being frustrated when we made a mistake and really picking each other up and focusing on the next point,” Lothman said. “[We want to] make sure everyone else comes in and gives you a pat on the back, and lets you know, ‘We got your back, let’s get this next point. Don’t think about the last one.’ Because when you think about the last one, that’s usually when you drop the next one.”
The energy change was noticeable immediately, and Harvard’s passing and hitting improved greatly in the third game. The Crimson held a two-point cushion until 13-11, when Harvard strung together several powerful runs to extend its advantage. Despite two timeouts called by the Scarlet Raiders, the Crimson was back in the driver’s seat.
Behind freshman outside hitter DJ White’s five kills in the frame, Harvard rolled to a 25-15 win to take control of the match.
The Crimson continued to roll early in the fourth set and stormed to a 4-0 lead. Rutgers-Newark never found a foothold back into the match after its poor start, and Harvard took the set and match, 25-20.
Co-captain Matt Jones added five of his game-high 15 kills in the decisive set.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After successfully coaching the Harvard football team to an undefeated Ivy season in 2011, Harvard coach Tim Murphy will play life coach for a couple of hours this May, when he gives the undergraduate commencement address at his alma mater, Springfield College. This decision was announced last Thursday.
Murphy earned a bachelor’s and master’s degree from Springfield and was a four-year starter on the school’s football team. As a senior in 1977, he earned All-New England honors at linebacker.
Murphy bolstered his commencement speaker application this year by being named the president of the American Football Coaches Association. His candidacy was further helped by the success of former player Ryan Fitzpatrick '05, who gained notoriety early in 2011 by leading his Buffalo Bills to a 4-1 start, including a win over the eventual AFC champion New England Patriots.
Springfield’s graduate commencement will be on May 12, with the undergraduate commencement being held on the following day.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
LeBron James and the rest of the Miami Heat are in town facing off against the Boston Celtics. And that led me to wonder: Who is the Miami Heat of the Ivy League?
There are many sides to consider in terms of assigning a member of the Ancient Eight to a franchise considered by some to be the NBA’s evil empire. What team takes on the embodiment of sellouts, makes national media for the wrong reasons, and disappears in the fourth quarter?
Without a doubt, all signs point to New Haven.
Earlier this season, Yale football replenished its coaching staff by reaching out to Harvard DB and special teams coach Tony Reno. After Reno took over as head coach for the Bulldogs, three additional Crimson coaches “took their talents” to New Haven in search of Yale’s first championship in five seasons. Sound familiar, LeBron?
With LeBron’s rapidly receding hairline in mind, it’s clear that being the center of attention can come with its pressures. That’s something Yale QB Patrick Witt should be familiar with.
In the weeks leading up to The Game, Witt took over national headlines with—dare we say it—“The Decision 2.0,” as he decided between playing in his last Harvard-Yale matchup and attending his Rhodes scholarship interview...or so we thought. In the weeks following The Game, reports surfaced stating that Witt’s candidacy for the scholarship had in fact been put on hold.
There’s nothing quite like performing under pressure and coming through in the clutch. For both the Heat and the Bulldogs, however, there’s been a strange tendency to vanish in the fourth quarter.
Just as LeBron and Miami received grief for their collapse in the 2011 NBA Finals, Yale got its own earful for the Harvard-Yale game of 1968. In 2008, filmmaker Kevin Rafferty even produced a documentary on the game, Harvard Beats Yale 29-29.
Leading 29-13 with less than two minutes to play, the heavily favored Bulldogs were in position to capture the Ivy League championship. But in the final minute, Yale collapsed, giving up 16 points in the final 42 seconds and allowing Harvard to “win” 29-29.
And to top it all off, in similar fashion to the Crimson’s blowout victory over the Bulldogs at the Yale Bowl, 45-7, this past fall, the Celtics prevailed over the Heat at the TD Garden on Sunday, 91-72.

Last week, Flyby published a piece summarizing the festivities that will be taking place around Ivy League campuses this spring. Since then, two further schools have announced their line-ups:
Cornell's Slope Day will see alternative rock band Neon Trees open for British singer/songwriter Taio Cruz on May 4.
Columbia's spring term celebrations now also have a face, though perhaps one that is not as prominent as Taio Cruz. The latest installment of Bacchanal will see Wavves, Curren$y and headliners Big Gigantic energizing the crowd at this year's 90s-themed (Baccha90s) party.
But the Columbia Spectator reports that the music world is less than satisfied with the students to attend the show.

Half a trailer is parked outside the Science Center, bearing a Plaza Taco logo on it. Although the logo looks cute, how the food tastes is the real question at hand.
Plaza Taco will offer four tacos: Korean BBQ Beef, Carnitas, Pollo Asado, and Vegetarian.
The Rundown:
Korean BBQ Beef
Korean barbecue beef comes equipped with the meat itself, shredded lettuce, tomato, kimchee, sour cream, and barbecue sauce.
Carnitas
Pulled pork is served alongside pico de gallo, lettuce, sour cream, guacamole, shredded Monterey Jack, and hot aioli.
Pollo Asado
Lime pulled chicken is complemented by pico de gallo, lettuce, sour cream, guacamole, shredded Monterrey Jack, and chipotle sauce.
Vegetarian
Spicy seitan get paired in this final offering with pico de gallo, lettuce, guacamole, shredded Monterrey Jack, and jalapeño cilantro sauce.
This Flyby correspondent sampled the Pollo Asado and the Vegetarian tacos. Here's what she found.
Pollo Asado: The lime is generally slightly sour, the pulled chicken has a sweet tinge to it, and the pico de gallo and the chipotle sauce have hints of spiciness to them that complement the sweet and sour flavors. Overall, the pollo asado is a mix of tastes, rich and saturated. Of course, the guacamole, sour cream, and lettuce gave the taco that extra, needed freshness.
Vegetarian: You're given a taco. You start to eat it, when parts of the taco fall out. They are a rich, brown color. Isn't this supposed to be a vegetarian taco? The speciality of Plaza Taco's vegetarian taco is seitan, or wheat gluten, which has a similar texture and appearance to meat. The seitan for the tacos is cooked with soy sauce and actually tastes very, very good. Filled with flavor, this taco is a keeper.
Go check out Plaza Tacos from 11 a.m. - 3 p.m. Monday-Friday. Tacos cost $4.75 each.
