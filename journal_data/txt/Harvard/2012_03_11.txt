After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the Harvard men’s lacrosse team takes on Georgetown, one thing is assured—the game is going to be close. 
Coming into Saturday’s contest, each of the squads’ meetings the last three seasons was decided by one goal. In 2012, the outcome was no different, with the No. 20 Crimson dropping an 11-10 contest in Washington, D.C.
After losing by one goal against Hofstra last weekend, Harvard looks to be continuing a disturbing trend of dropping tight games that began last season, when it missed the NCAA Tournament thanks to four one-goal defeats.
On Saturday, Harvard (2-2) went into the fourth period down, 9-7, before evening the match on two scores by sophomore attackman Daniel Eipp. But the Hoyas (2-1) responded with two goals of its own, and junior attack Jeff Cohen’s response, with 4:45 left on the clock, was all the Crimson would be able to muster the rest of the way.
“I think [losing by one is] worse than losing big, because you know you’re right there with a chance to win,” Eipp said. “That was our downfall last year, so we can’t let that happen again this year.”
Junior midfielder Alex White got the scoring going 3:39 into the contest, taking a pass from Cohen and beating Georgetown goalie Matt Winter.
Jason McFadden and Dan McKinney would respond with two unassisted goals for Georgetown before Cohen found freshman defenseman Stephen Jahelka with 2:55 to go in the period. Jahelka, Harvard’s top recruit, fired a shot past Winter for his first collegiate goal.
After the Crimson’s Joe Petrucci was called for slashing 30 seconds later, Brian Casey beat Harvard junior goalie Harry Krieger for a man-up score to put the Hoyas up, 3-2, after one. 
Tri-captain Kevin Vaughan responded to tie the game 1:24 into the second. But a sixty-second illegal body check penalty on senior midfielder Andrew Pataki gave Zack Angel and McFadden the ability to add two more man-up scores to give Georgetown back the lead. The Hoyas would finish 5-of-6 on man-up opportunities on the day.
With the scoring coming quickly, Eipp found freshman attack Will Walker, who beat Winter at the 10:47 mark to cut the Harvard deficit to 5-4. Despite the four goals in the first five minutes, neither team scored for the remainder of the period until Georgetown’s Travis Comeau slipped a shot past Krieger with just 19 seconds to go.
“I made a bad play at the end of the half, and they came down and scored that goal,” Vaughan said. “It was definitely a momentum-shifter. You hate to give up any goals in the last minute of any quarter.”
The third period was dominated by six penalties—four on the Hoyas—which allowed each squad to add two man-up scores.
Cohen added his second goal of the game just 55 seconds in to cut Georgetown’s lead to 6-5, but McFadden responded with a man-up score a minute later. After the Hoyas’ Zac Guy was called for slashing, Eipp (from Walker) and Cohen (from Eipp) tied the game at seven with man-up goals just 45 seconds apart.
“Jeff’s the guy we look to to score goals when we need them,” Vaughan said. “He’s the guy that’s keeping the boat afloat, and we need more guys playing like him to be successful.”
But Angel added his second score of the contest with 9:07 to go, and after a slashing penalty on senior defenseman Paul Pate, Comeau scored his second late-in-a-period goal by beating Krieger with 1:13 remaining in the third.
Harvard tied the game behind Eipp early in the fourth. But after falling behind once more, the Crimson was unable to take advantage of a number of late chances to even things up again, despite outshooting Georgetown 9-2 in the period.
“I think we came out very focused in the second half with some momentum,” Eipp said. “But we made some key mistakes with possession of the ball that led the loss. We had a couple of opportunities to score at the end of the game, and we couldn’t make it work.”
Eipp and Cohen each registered five points on a hat trick with two assists on the afternoon, giving Cohen a team-high 13 goals through four games this season. Angel and McFadden had hat tricks for Georgetown, while Krieger and Winter both made 12 saves.
Freshman midfielder Keegan Mitchel won 15-of-22 faceoffs and collected seven ground balls as Harvard won both those categories handily but—thanks in part to 23 turnovers—was unable to take the contest.
“We committed a lot of penalties on the defensive end, committed a lot of turnovers on the offensive end, and those two things definitely led to a lot of their goals,” Vaughan said. “It’s not for a lack of talent or a lack of will that we lost this game. But we’ve got to be more disciplined, limit the turnovers, and try to play a bit smarter.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With winter seasons coming to a close, spring seasons underway, and March Madness on the horizon, The Back Page takes a look at the top five teams in Harvard athletics at the moment.
5. Men’s Volleyball
After losing to a powerful Penn State squad, Harvard has rolled of five straight wins, including a tight, 3-2 victory over George Mason, to whom the team had lost in early February. At 11-2 and led by co-captain and reigning EIVA offensive player of the week Matt Jones, the squad will spend its spring break in California as it looks to continue its winning streak on the west coast.
4. Men’s Tennis
Entering this weekend at the Hilton Mission Valley Spring Classic in San Diego, No. 26 Harvard looks to continue its success this year so far. The Crimson stands at 10-1 overall with ECAC Division I championships already under its belt as it heads into the major part of its schedule.
3. Women’s Swimming and Diving
After securing the 10th Ivy League title in team history, Harvard finished tied for second the ECAC championships behind first place Navy. With 12 all-Ivy selections, the Crimson will send a total of five swimmers and divers from to the NCAA championships, with three going to the NCAA Zone Diving Championships this weekend and two to the nationals the following weekend.
2. Men’s Basketball
Although Harvard had its 28-game home winning streak snapped a couple weeks back in a heartbreaking loss against Penn, the Crimson bounced back with two close wins against Columbia and Cornell. And with a Penn loss last Tuesday night, Harvard is headed to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 1946. The Crimson will look to bust some brackets next week after it hears it seeding this selection Sunday.
1. Women’s Squash
Finishing the season at a perfect 17-0, Harvard captured both the Ivy League championship and the CSA national championship, defeating Yale in relatively-easy, 8-1 victory in the final and avenging its loss against the Bulldogs in last season’s final. A major difference this year was freshman Amanda Sobhy, who followed up her strong team performance by winning the CSA Individual Championships last Sunday. On the men’s side, sophomore Ali Farag won the CSA Individual Championship as well, capping a very strong showing overall for Harvard squash.

On Friday the Knicks had an opportunity to improve their playoff prospects against ninth place Milwaukee. But while the team found its offensive rhythm against the Bucks, it had no answer for its opponent defensively, eventually falling, 119-114.
Down the stretch, the Knicks went on a 7-0 run to rob momentum from the Bucks. But Brandon Jennings iced it from the line to bring his total to 25 on the night. Mike Dunleavy, and Ersan Ilyasova also came up big with a combined for 51 points.
For the second straight game, Jeremy Lin ’10 finished with an impressive 20 points. In 40 minutes of play, he went 8-for-14 from the field. While he was on the floor, the Knicks had a 13-point advantage on the scoreboard.
Thanks to Knicks coach Mike D’Antoni’s run-and-gun offensive style, back-up Baron Davis also saw significant playing time.
Lin displayed his playmaking ability, finding both Landry Fields and Amare Stoudemire for easy first quarter finishes.
Stoudemire led the way for New York with 27, and Anthony, despite missing a key late-game free throw, finished with 22.
Lin, who only sat for five minutes in the first half, scored nine and recorded eight assists.
Turnovers continued to hamper Lin. He had five on the night, including one that led to a Jennings flush. On the other end of the floor he finished with four steals.
With the loss, New York comes up empty-handed on its four game road swing. The squad also lost to Boston, Dallas, and San Antonio.

The Harvard women’s lacrosse team was 174 seconds away from snapping its 11-year losing streak against No. 9/10 Penn.
With 2:54 to play in Saturday’s conference matchup at the Quakers’ Franklin Field, junior Danielle Tetreault found the back of the net off a free-position shot to give the Crimson a 12-11 lead.
But Harvard couldn’t hang on. With 1:06 to go in regulation, Penn’s Caroline Bunting evened the score at 12 with her fourth goal of the contest, sending the game to overtime. The Quakers struck sixteen seconds into the extra period to their first lead in more than 50 minutes of play and didn’t give it up, claiming a 14-13 win.
“Not meaning to sound dramatic, but that was probably one of the most disappointing results I can remember,” co-captain Melanie Baskind said.
The loss drops the Crimson (2-2, 0-2 Ivy), which entered the season ranked No. 19 in the country, into a tie with Columbia for last place in the Ancient Eight standings.
Tetreault and junior Micaela Cyr finished with three goals apiece while co-captain Melanie Baskind led Harvard with a season-high four goals. Baskind’s final score with 16:23 to play gave the Crimson its largest lead of the afternoon, 10-5.
But after being held to five goals in the first 45 minutes of play, the Quakers offense hit its stride, responding with four goals in a five-minute stretch,
Tetreault stopped the bleeding with a free-position goal with 7:57, but Bunting and Erin Brennan answered with back-to-back scores to even the score at 11 with 5:55 to go.
Tetreault, who scored the game-winner for the Crimson in its double-overtime victory over James Madison on Tuesday, came up in the clutch once again, giving the Crimson a 12-11 lead with her third score of the afternoon.
Harvard appeared to be in the driver’s seat, claiming the ensuing draw control. But a Crimson turnover with 2:43 to go gave the Quakers (3-2, 1-0) another shot. Penn’s Taylor Foussadier picked up the loose ball and Bunting put away the equalizer 1:37 later.
The Quakers had two more opportunities to find the net before the end of regulation, but Courtney Tomchik’s shot with 10 seconds to play sailed high and Brennan’s attempt at the buzzer was turned away by Harvard keeper Kelly Weiss.
The Quakers got on the board first in overtime, as Brennan beat the Crimson’s rookie goalkeeper.
The game appeared headed to a second overtime when Harvard senior Jess Halpern evened the score at 13 with 1:20 to go. But the Quakers weren’t done, as Penn’s Maddie Polawksi pulled down the ensuing draw control.
Penn milked the clock until less than 30 seconds remained when Tomchik attacked the net. The sophomore finished an unassisted score with 24 seconds to go to put the Quakers ahead, 14-13.
Bunting won the game’s final draw control, and Penn ran out the clock to capture its first Ivy victory.
Bunting, Tomchik, and Brennan finished with 11 of the Quakers’ 14 scores. Bunting and Tomchik notched four apiece while Brennan, a unanimous first-team All-Ivy selection in 2011, scored three goals and an assist.
“They’re program is changing,” Baskind said. “Historically, Penn has taken a lot of pride in its defense…. You’re seeing other teams score more against them this year, but they’re scoring a lot more goals themselves. They’re dangerous on the attack.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s basketball team has learned its opponent for its first NCAA tournament game in 66 years, but that news might not even be the biggest of the day for coach Tommy Amaker and his staff.
On Sunday afternoon, the Crimson earned a commitment from four-star prospect Zena Edosomwan, who turned down scholarship offers from UCLA, USC, UC Berkeley, Texas, and Washington and decided to undergo a post-graduate year at Northfield Mount Hermon School (Mass.) in order to attend Harvard.
“It’s a special day for all of us—for me [and] for Harvard basketball," Edosomwan said.
Currently a senior at Harvard-Westlake School (Calif.), the 6’9", 225-pound forward is a top-100 prospect on Scout.com—the first player of such a distinction on that site to commit to an Ivy League school—as well as a 92 on ESPN.com.
“Coach Amaker and [assistant coach Yanni Hufnagel], they’ve just been very supportive, and I couldn’t see myself anywhere else," Edosomwan said. "It’s the best school in the world, the basketball is building, and I want to be a part of that—I want to make history there.”
Edosomwan, the jewel and main target of Amaker’s 2012 class, has been determined to attend Harvard since he visited the campus in late September.
And he has taken standardized tests multiple times in order to do so.
Harvard-Westlake coach Greg Hilliard told The Crimson last week that Edosomwan was waiting for the results of his January SAT to determine if he had qualified academically for Harvard.
“I’ve talked to all the coaches that are still waiting and hoping he  comes to them, and none of them have ever run into somebody who has the  options that he has and is waiting for a non-scholarship school, which I  think is pretty amazing,” Hilliard said. “His heart and mind are  definitely in the right place.”
Instead of continuing to try to gain acceptance for this year's class, Edosomwan has decided to reclassify as a 2013 prospect and attend nearby Northfield Mount Hermon, one of the top prep programs in the country, before aiming to arrive in Cambridge in the fall of 2013.
“It's been his dream to attend Harvard, and he wasn't going to stop until he'd explored every option,” said Northfield Mount Hermon head coach John Carroll. “He did his research, and he talked to the Harvard guys, and we do a good job of getting guys ready for the Ivy League.”
Edosomwan is a member of the Rivals Top 150 and will replace current Northfield Mount Hermon senior Evan Cummins, who committed to Harvard last May, in the Hoggers front-court.
"We're not going to tell him how we're going to use him—he's going to tell us," Carroll said. "He's very, very strong. He's an endless worker—off the court, on the court, in the classroom, out of the classroom. He's just a really hard-working, modest, humble kid."
The gifted athlete remains well aware of the challenges that lie ahead.
“There are no guarantees,” Edosomwan said. “Going to Northfield Mount Hermon betters the chances of me getting into Harvard.”
"He'll continue to take the test, and he'll take a strenuous courseload," said Carroll, whose program boasts 25 graduates currently playing Division I college basketball—11 of whom are in the Ivy League, including Crimson senior Andrew Van Nest and sophomores Laurent Rivard and Matt Brown.
Carroll said that five of those 11 were post-graduate players and that no post-graduate Hogger has ever failed to academically qualify.
"We've spent a lot of time visiting practices, talking to coaches, talking to academic people, talking to admissions people at different schools," Carroll said. "Northfield Mount Hermon does an incredible job of preparing kids for any college, and we've just happened to have gotten really good at preparing kids for the Ivies."
This fall, Amaker will welcome to campus current high school seniors Cummins, Siyani Chambers, Mike Hall, and Agunwa Okolie.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s almost time to dance. And as of Sunday night, the Harvard men’s basketball team finally knows where.
The Crimson is the 12th seed in the East Regional of the NCAA tournament and will face No. 5 seed Vanderbilt on Thursday in Albuquerque, N.M.
"We're thrilled to represent our conference, our university, and certainly our program and to do the best we can," Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. "We're excited to put ourselves in this position and we're certainly hoping for the best. We know this great tournament is going to be as sensational as it has always been with a number of incredible games."
The Crimson—which will play in its first NCAA tournament since 1946—comes into the game on the tail of a big two-game sweep of Columbia and Cornell in the team’s final Ancient Eight games of the year.
But Harvard did not know for sure it would make it to the Big Dance until Princeton knocked off Penn Tuesday night, eliminating the possibility of a playoff between the Quakers and the Crimson to determine which team would claim the Ivy League’s automatic bid. With the Tigers’ win, Harvard earned its first outright Ancient Eight title in school history—and along with it, a chance to dance.
Because the Ivy League doesn’t have a conference tournament at the end of the season, Harvard was among the first teams to punch a ticket to the NCAA tournament. And the Crimson players feel they are ready to take on upcoming challenges in Albuquerque.
“This is the reason that all of us came here,” said junior forward Kyle Casey, who was recently tabbed to the All-Ivy first team. “It’s been a long three years—and four years for [co-captains Keith Wright and Oliver McNally].... There have been a lot of ups and downs, but it’s nice to see the hard work paying off.”
"[This is] surreal,” Wright echoed. “It’s hard work paying off.... To be able to celebrate with [my teammates] and seeing our name up there on the screen was priceless. You can't really explain it. There aren’t really words for the feelings that I have.”
If the Crimson is able to upset the Commodores, it would meet the winner of the matchup between 13th-seeded Montana and fourth-seeded Wisconsin on Saturday.
But Harvard can’t look past Vanderbilt, which enters the NCAA tournament on the heels of a huge upset of the tournament’s overall No. 1 seed, Kentucky, in the finals of the SEC conference tournament Sunday afternoon.
“Certainly, Vanderbilt, just seeing what they've done today beating Kentucky in the final of the SEC tournament, obviously we know how tremendous of a ball club they have,” Amaker said. “I know they're a veteran basketball team [and] a good ball team…to play the way they played in the past and have the kind of team they have now. "
If the Crimson can win two games this coming weekend, the second leg of its journey would bring Harvard a lot closer to home, as Boston plays host to the Eastern Regional semifinal and final games. But, according to McNally, that possibility isn’t even on Harvard’s radar right now.
“All these specifics, they don’t really mean anything yet,” McNally said. “We’re in it. We were able to do it. This is why I came here. I love the sport of college basketball.... This is the best sporting event in the world, and to be a part of it, that’s one the biggest dreams I’ve had so far.”
With midterm season just behind the squad, Crimson players noted increased fan excitement all around the Harvard campus.
“Everybody’s in the library, studying,”  Wright said. “You’re walking to go get a snack in between study  sessions, and you see students. They’re giving you high fives and  telling you good luck and congratulations. And these are people that you’ve never talked to before or seen before.  The culture that I’ve seen grow here is absolutely phenomenal.”
But midterms won’t be an issue this weekend, and Amaker feels confident in the team’s usual pre-game preparations heading into the latest game endowed with the title of 'biggest game in Harvard basketball history.'
“We’re going to be ready to go to work tomorrow,” Amaker said. “We’ve been practicing well.... We know that we’ve played in a tournament before this year, and we’ve been in a neutral site environment on courts, and we’ve played against some teams comparable to the team we have to play coming up this week. So I think we need to take business as usual in a lot of ways.”
