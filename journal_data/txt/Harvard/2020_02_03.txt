After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The problem of race ambles around inside my mind often — like a parasite, gnawing away at the pleasures of everyday life. The substantial effort made by heroes — yesterday and today — in pursuit of racial equality is remarkable. But nevertheless, racism’s pernicious role in our society has proved quite resilient. We have entered a “woke” era in which racial injustices are better understood than in times before. But as a black American, I do fear that our approach to combating racism has concerning blindspots.
In our attempts to attack racism we sometimes neglect its malevolent roots. If we seek true progress, we must strive to deconstruct the concept of race altogether.
Racism was soaked into the American cloth long before talk of revolutions and constitutions. So it should be no surprise that it’s a stain requiring a backbreaking effort to remove — a centuries-long project near and dear to social progressives. Obviously, any solution must begin with identifying the problem at hand and as a result — in recent years in particular — journalists and social scientists have made a good faith effort to understand and publicize racial injustices. It’s been well-documented that in this country your race has a tremendous impact on your economic and social opportunities.
The government can pass reforms to address racial issues, as many of the 2020 Democratic candidates propose to do. But most of us are not politicians, so what’s our role in racial progress?
Individuals can strive to counteract institutional injustices by looking inward toward their own racial biases. “How are my biases affecting my behavior towards someone?” Because so much of racism is subconscious, in order to make a self-correction, one needs to employ vigilance. This approach has positive effects, but ultimately fails the long term goal of deconstructing race.
It necessitates racial categorization — further focusing our perspective through the lens of race.  One must know each and every stereotype to actively combat it. Recall the H&M controversy, where the company (likely accidentally) listed a shirt reading “Coolest Monkey in the Jungle” with a black child as the model and were met with strong backlash. The expectation inherent in this backlash is that H&M should have been aware of the historical significance of the imagery, noticed it, and amended it. The controversy illustrates how this approach can force Americans to maintain racial stereotypes in the foreground of their consciousness.
This approach of acknowledging and emphasizing race certainly has short-term positive effects, so it is difficult to write it off entirely. I would personally prefer if people thought twice before “complimenting” me for being “so gosh darn articulate.”
In a similar vein, members of oppressed groups have taken it upon themselves to adopt ways of coping with racism’s boot. The Black Pride movement illustrates how a group repeatedly beat down by messaging of their worthlessness can fight back against those notions. Here at Harvard, there are many affinity groups which provide their members with a nurturing way to encourage pride like Black Men’s Forum or the Asian American Association. Fighting the emotional stress of racism by embracing one’s own race allows for healing. It is incredibly valuable. But, this too has a long term trade-off.
Practically, race clearly matters a great deal, but I believe that the ultimate goal in a just society is to weaken race as a salient identifier. The Caribbean philosopher Frantz Fanon said it best when he argued, “the man who adores the Negro is as ‘sick’ as he who abominates him.” Fanon pushed back on what in his time was called “negritude” — the movement to embrace and cherish one’s own blackness. He argued that it was nonsensical to cherish something that should not even exist.
In other words, society is “sick” with the constructed social phenomenon of race. And many progressives’ approaches to grappling with racism fail to address the root of the problem — the existence of race itself.
There is a constant trade-off between the benefit of emphasizing race to form a solution and the harm of strengthening race as tool of categorization.
Redistributive remedies require identifying the recipients and their needs. We cannot be race-blind. However we must always be cognizant of the trade-off. As, say, an interviewer, the anti-racist benefit of correcting one’s own biases might outweigh the cost. But this is not always the case. For example, I struggle to see how preventing Katy Perry from wearing cornrows has enough of a positive effect for me and other black people that it should outweigh the cost of implementing stringent social rules about race. Solidifying racial distinctions is no trivial cost.
These rules declare that who you are should matter, which is very different from responding to how it does. Though in good faith, they seem contrary to progressive ideals. In some cases, we must embrace the importance of race as it is the only path to progress. But simultaneously, we must always remember the trade-off because deconstruction is the only escape from the problem of race.

Last Monday, a Connecticut Superior Court annulled all charges against the ten Harvard students and alumni who partook in the pro-divestment protest at the Harvard-Yale football game in November. The decision, delivered by Judge Phillip Scarpellino, erases any legal record of the arrest, enabling all protesters charged to truthfully claim they have never been arrested under Connecticut law.
We reaffirm our support of the protesters themselves, including those who were not ultimately arrested. By storming the field they demonstrated a steadfast commitment to pursuing change through direct action, and their passion and boldness are laudable. With the dangers and consequences of climate change increasingly apparent, we continue to support the divest movement and its participants.
The Court’s decision, however, also embodies an undeniable degree of legal privilege. We can’t help but feel that the high-profile nature of the case favoured such an outcome. Not every college protest attracts reactions from leading national politicians, and we remain at least open to the possibility that an association with two prestigious institutions weighed in the protesters’ favor. Consequently, the legal non-ramifications of the arrested protesters’ actions must be viewed in the context of that insulation.
This, of course, does not mean that the Court’s decision is not worth celebrating, at least out of sympathy for those it benefits. It also does not imply that the demonstrators’ actions are somehow less commendable. Acknowledging privilege does not necessitate discounting the efforts of those who benefit from it. It merely amounts to being aware of the structural factors at play that make certain actions more permissible in some groups than in others.
It’s also worth noting that not everyone who enjoyed the privilege those arrested had chose to deploy it to serve such a worthwhile end. Accordingly, we commend those who participated in the protest for using their advantaged position to pursue divestment, and for running to the field in the name of change. Even if their particular social and demographic context ensured a lenient, slap-on-the-wrist outcome, their actions remain admirable and we hope they do not flag in their efforts to make our community a more just and equitable place.
Indeed, acknowledging that most members of our student body are well positioned to partake in somewhat shielded activism is, if anything, a reason to encourage them to do so. As we have argued in the past, protests are crucial, empowering, and bring visibility to a broad variety of perspectives. They reflect a refusal to remain silent when institutions — particularly our institution — act in ways we judge to be wrong or harmful.
The events of Harvard-Yale exemplify that Harvard students enjoy a privileged position to make our voices heard, a national media that amplifies our efforts, and a judicial system merciful to our actions. We hope Harvard students will continue to use this privilege to work towards enacting important change.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I was younger, I looked to the stars for humanity’s future. But recently, a chant I heard at a climate rally reminded me to keep my attention close to the ground: “There Is No Planet B.”
There are some people who disagree with this slogan; they believe that “Planet B” really exists, orbiting the Sun just a bit further than Earth. One such believer is Elon Musk. If you visit Musk’s twitter account — which I don’t recommend, it’s pretty cringy — you’ll see that his cover photo is an illustration of the planet Mars in four stages of development. The first shows the red Mars that we know today; the second depicts a greening Mars with a small liquid ocean; the third expands the foliage and waterways and even introduces a Martian atmosphere; the fourth is almost indistinguishable from Earth.
This process, known as “terraforming,” is a massive technological undertaking whereby a celestial body, like a planet or a moon, is modified in order to become habitable for humans. It’s a common theme in science fiction, but some people — like Musk — think it could actually be achieved. Elon thinks of Mars as a backup planet in case something goes wrong on Earth. All we need to do is tweak Mars’ current features to be more like Earth’s, and voila: humanity has a cozy new home.
Unfortunately, Elon Musk is wrong. Mars is not, and will never be, our “Planet B.”
There are many non-trivial features of Mars that we simply cannot change. Mars’ gravity is only 38 percent that of Earth, and its year lasts 687 days — both factors would make adapting to life on Mars a significant challenge for Earth plants and animals. But, as proponents of terraforming would point out, not every feature of Mars is as immutable as these.
Currently, Mars’ soil is full of perchlorates — hazardous chemicals that could kill the crops we try to grow. Fortunately, perchlorates dissolve in water, so all we have to do is rinse out the soil. So... how do we get water on Mars?
Well, thankfully, Mars has a lot of water already in the form of frozen ice caps. Freeing up that water requires heating up Mars’ surface temperature well above its current -81°F average. But, hold on... how do we do that?
Well, the main reason Mars is so cold is due to its very thin atmosphere, which is incapable of trapping in the Sun’s heat. If Mars were to have an Earth-like atmosphere, the planet should begin to heat up, melting the ice, allowing us to grow crops. Makes sense. But how do we produce a thick Martian atmosphere?
That’s the trillion-dollar question.
And unfortunately, this is where we hit a dead end. Existing proposals for how to give Mars an atmosphere require three main ingredients: lots of money, lots of time, and technology that we don’t yet possess. Plus, even if we could give Mars the right atmosphere, the planet has no way to hold on to it. Unlike Earth, Mars has a relatively weak magnetosphere — a magnetic “shield” that protects a planet’s atmosphere from escaping into outer space. Without a strong enough magnetosphere, any atmosphere that we give Mars would be stripped away by the force of solar winds.
Clearly, Mars will never be a second Earth. But even if it were technically possible to terraform Mars, there are other compelling reasons to avoid doing so.
The first is an aesthetic argument. While some people might look at Elon’s cover photo and feel excitement, I feel the opposite. Why on Earth do we need another Earth in this solar system? Mars is such a unique planet, with its high mountains, deep canyons, and beautiful rust-red soil. We don’t need another blue-and-green marble orbiting the Sun. (Maybe I’m just biased because red is my favorite color.)
If that doesn’t convince you, consider the scientific loss. As it stands, scientists are unsure if Mars has any lifeforms. Some speculate that there may be microbial life living deep below Mars’ surface. This would be an astounding discovery. Tragically, terraforming would erase our ability to confirm the existence of life on Mars — it would be near-impossible to distinguish which microbes were native to the planet and which were brought with us from Earth.
Ultimately, I think people like Elon Musk are driven by a genuine sense of scientific curiosity when they discuss terraforming Mars. Even so, I think the idea is a ridiculous distraction. Those who tantalize us with fantasies of other habitable worlds are doing humanity a grave disservice. Any attempt to terraform Mars would be a massive failure, and would cost precious time and resources that would be far better spent on protecting the Earth. While fighting climate change is a challenge, it’s one million times easier to keep Earth habitable than to start a new habitable planet from scratch.
There is no Planet B. This fact shouldn’t scare us; instead, it should make us cherish our home on Planet A.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With more than 20,000 signatures in hand, supporters for Harvard Forward on Saturday hand-carried nomination forms for the annual Board of Overseers election to Loeb House, which houses Harvard’s governing boards and its administrative offices.
Harvard Forward — a student and alumni group working to bring attention to climate change and recent alumni representation within Harvard’s governance boards — endorsed five candidates to sit on the Board of Overseers — the University’s second highest governing body.
Each candidate received over 4,500 alumni signatures, according to a Harvard Forward press release. About 3,000 signatures from eligible voters are required to put a candidate on the ballot.
“The final signature count, pending verification from the Office of the Governing Boards, consists of nearly 1,400 online signers and more than 3,400 unique in-person signers,” the press release reads. “Given that each candidate must be nominated individually, the campaign ultimately collected over 20,000 separate signatures.”
Despite Harvard Forward endorsing its own candidates in October, Harvard did not nominate any of the group’s endorsed Overseer candidates to the ballot last month. However, a candidate could make it onto the ballot by submitting a petition with 2,936 alumni signatures — one percent of eligible voters in the prior year’s election — by Feb 1.
Harvard Forward’s campaign comes as students and faculty are calling on the University to divest from fossil fuel companies. Harvard Forward’s platform argues that the school should divest all assets from fossil fuels, reserve 20 percent of seats on the Board of Overseers for recent graduates, and develop more transparent investment guidelines.
The University has repeatedly declined to divest. Instead, University President Lawrence S. Bacow has stressed engaging with fossil fuel companies and increasing scholarship that helps combat climate change.
At Saturday's event, a group of roughly ten Harvard Forward organizers gathered in front of Cafe Pamplona in Harvard Square before walking to Loeb House to deliver the nomination forms. Supporters held previous campaign signs that read “We’re looking for 2,936 Harvard alumni who care about climate change.” They crossed out “are looking for” on the sign with markers and wrote “found more than.”
At 4:20 p.m., Harvard Forward supporters, carrying the petitions in six full baskets, entered Loeb House.
Danielle O. Strasburger ’18, Harvard Forward’s campaign manager, celebrated the group’s milestone with a bottle of champagne shortly after dropping off the forms.
The candidates thanked their supporters on social media after achieving the required number of signatures needed to be considered for the ballot. One of the candidates — Margaret “Midge” Purce ’17 — wrote on Twitter that she was proud over 4,500 people nominated her and the other four contenders onto the Overseers ballot.
“SO PROUD to say that over 4500 people signed to nominate myself and 4 other candidates to Harvard’s Board of Overseers!!!” Purce wrote on Twitter. “My dad’s gonna be so proud.”
University spokesperson Christopher M. Hennessy wrote in an email to The Crimson that Harvard is grateful for engaged alumni.
"Harvard has diverse and engaged alumni around the world, and we are grateful for their continued commitment and interest in the university,” he wrote.
The University has received the nomination forms, and it will now verify and validate petition submissions over the next two weeks, according to Hennessy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the first week of classes underway, members of the Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Automobile Workers strike traded in their picket signs for syllabi and resumed their roles as teaching fellows.
The union began its strike on Dec. 3 over disagreements with the University on three key contract provisions regarding compensation, health care, and sexual harassment and discrimination procedures. The strike — which delayed some departments’ grades and forced others to change their final exam formats — came to an end on Jan.1 with no contract.
Negotiations are ongoing, but many graduate students have returned to work. Alexis Turner, a Ph.D. candidate in History of Science, said the process of resuming her role as a teaching fellow was “very straightforward” in her department.
“I think people have largely picked up where they left off,” Turner said. “Immediately after we returned to work, there was about a week of furious grading, but other than that, I think it’s been uneventful.”
Some classes — such as Economics 10a — changed their final exam formats last semester so that grades could be released without delay. Teaching fellows for those classes said they were greeted with a clean slate, with no lingering exams to grade.
Joseph H. Meeker, a teaching fellow for Economics 10a and 10b, wrote in an email to The Crimson that he found the transition back to work to be a smooth process.
“The biggest thing on my plate at the end of the semester was helping to grade exams and it seems like that was taken care of,” Meeker wrote. “I think everyone is excited to hit the ground running in the new semester.”
He further wrote that although he respected the HGSU-UAW strike efforts, he was excited to return to normalcy.
“I was proud to join the unit in the strike effort but now that it's over, I'm happy to return to my teaching duties,” Meeker wrote. “I'm not sure how close we are to having a contract, and I know that we might have to take action in the future to make sure we get the protections we need. But in the meantime I'm excited to get back to work.”
Harvard faculty members said they welcomed the graduate students’ return. History Professor Alison Frank Johnson wrote in an email to The Crimson that the graduate students remained “full members” of the University’s academic community during the course of the strike.
“This start of the semester is proceeding smoothly and as usual,” Frank Johnson wrote. “As always, I’m grateful for the work done by graduate students in our community.”
Abraham “Avi” Loeb, the chair of the Astronomy Department, said the faculty aim to “cultivate a very healthy environment” with their graduate students. Even in light of the strike, Loeb described the relationship between faculty and graduate students as “constructive,” rather than “contractual.”
“We understand the concerns that led to the strike, and we very much hope that they would be resolved to the satisfaction of the union,” Loeb said.
In December, the University and the union agreed to request a federal mediator to help with negotiations, as only one three-hour negotiating session occurred during the four-week strike. Four bargaining sessions with the federal mediator took place in January, but no contract has been reached.
Turner said although the strike ended without a contract, she hopes it made the University realize that graduate students play an integral part on campus as teaching fellows.
“I do think that the strike did affect the University,” Turner said. “Based on the degree to which they responded to the strike while we were on strike, it did seem to me that it made them at least a little bit nervous.”

Lawyers representing Reihana Emami Arandi — an Iranian citizen deported from Logan International Airport last fall while trying to attend Harvard Divinity School — filed a civil rights complaint with the Department of Homeland Security’s Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Office on Thursday.
After being accepted to the Master of Theological Studies program at HDS in May 2019, Arandi submitted an application for a student visa. She subsequently participated in an in-person clearance interview at the United States Consulate in Dubai, underwent a full review, screening, security checks, and approximately 90 days of additional administrative processing.
Arandi received her visa in mid-September and traveled to the U.S. on Sep. 18, roughly one week later.
Just after landing at Logan, Customs and Border Protection detained and questioned Arandi for over eight hours, according to court documents her lawyers filed in December. By 10:00 p.m. that night, the officers determined Arandi had “immigrant intent,” revoked her visa, and issued an expedited removal order with an additional five-year ban from entering the United States. Arandi was denied the option to withdraw her petition to enter the U.S. and reapply, which would have avoided the five-year ban, Corral said.
On the night of Arandi’s detainment, the Harvard International Office received several calls on its 24-hour emergency line, according to University spokesperson Jason A. Newton. The officer notified attorneys at HIRC, who agreed to represent Arandi alongside Susan Church, a Cambridge-based attorney.
The filing comes amid reports that an apparent memo has circulated U.S. CBP offices mandating officers to vet “all individuals” born between 1961 and 2001 with any “link” to Iran or Lebanon, according to POLITICO.
“We’re starting to see a pattern of these expedited removals at Logan Airport,” Jason Corral, an attorney at the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinical Program and one of Arandi’s lawyers, said.
Corral said he sees no basis for CBP to conclude that Arandi intended to stay in the U.S. permanently. Arandi has no friends or family in the United States, and the Divinity School is the only program in the United States she applied to, he said.
“We weren’t given any information as to why she had been detained,” Corral said.
Arandi flew home to Iran that night, having given up her employment at home and forfeited the opportunity to study at Harvard last fall.
The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Arandi’s lawyers subsequently filed a motion with CBP to reopen and rescind the expedited removal order on Oct. 18, asking that CBP to come to a decision by Oct. 25 so Arandi could still attend the Harvard Divinity School this academic year, according to December’s court filing.
CBP did not come to a decision on the motion within the timeframe, so Church filed a mandamus petition in the U.S. District Court in the District of Massachusetts on November 14, requesting the Court require CBP to quickly adjudicate the motion.
On Nov. 26, CBP denied the motion to rescind the expedited removal order without providing more information. Arandi’s lawyers revised the petition and refiled it on Dec. 16. The revised petition is currently pending before court.
“It’s a serious problem when our government allows a student to have three to four months of vetting and allows a single CBP officer, with the approval of a supervisor, to take that away,” Church said.
In response to concerns about international travel and CBP inspections at the border, Harvard's Vice Provost for International Affairs Mark C. Elliott wrote a letter to the school's Iranian community on Jan. 15. The letter included a link to an ACLU document regarding the rights of people entering the U.S. at the border, as well as information about handling CBP secondary inspections.
Newton wrote in an email that “while HIRC is handling all aspects of the legal case, HIO continues to be in regular contact with Reihana.”

In an email sent to Harvard affiliates Sunday, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’77 and Harvard University Health Services Director Giang T. Nguyen announced that all University-related travel to China would be postponed until further notice.
Garber and Nguyen also advised that people with “highly exceptional circumstances” for travelling to China before the end of February contact the Office of the Vice Provost for International Affairs. The email included a health form for all University affiliates who returned from China after Jan. 18 or are currently in China to receive additional assistance from HUHS.
This is the second email that Garber and Nguyen have sent to Harvard affiliates concerning coronavirus. On Jan. 29, Garber and Nguyen sent a similar email in which they advised against travel to China.
Sunday’s email came two days after the U.S. Department of State issued its highest travel advisory for China and three days after the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a public health emergency.
Over 14,000 cases of coronavirus in at least 23 countries have now been recorded, and the death toll is above 300.
On Saturday, Massachusetts state officials confirmed that a student at the University of Massachusetts Boston who recently returned from Wuhan, China — where the outbreak is believed to have originated — contradicted coronavirus. This is the first reported case of coronavirus in the state.
Garber and Nguyen acknowledged that the virus may cause “anxiety and emotional strain” and directed individuals towards Harvard’s mental health resources, including Counseling and Mental Health Services and Harvard’s Employee Assistance Program.
The pair included a reminder about the importance of treating all Harvard affiliates with “dignity and respect,” and reiterated that the risk that anyone at Harvard will contract coronavirus remains low.
“We emphasize that treating every member of our community with care and respect is of principal importance, especially during trying times like these. No member or segment of our community is at fault for this outbreak,” they wrote.
Garber and Nguyen wrote that the coronavirus outbreak is an “evolving situation” that Harvard is closely monitoring and that HUHS will continue to send periodic updates and update its website with any new information.

The Harvard University Police Department responded to several break-ins in Wigglesworth Hall on Saturday night, according to an email to students from Crimson Yard Resident Dean Dwight Fee.
Fee wrote that there were “some break-ins and attempted break-ins” in the F and H Entries of Wigglesworth Saturday. He told students to bring any keys “hidden” outside their room inside, to lock their windows, and to make sure their doors were locked at all times.
The Harvard University Police Department is conducting “an ongoing and active investigation” of the break-ins, HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano wrote in an email Sunday evening.
Wigglesworth students and proctors in F entryway could not be reached for comment on the incident. It is unknown if items were stolen during the reported break-in.
Burglars and trespassers broke into Wigglesworth as recently as September 2018, when several residents reported that a suspect had climbed through a first floor window during the night and taken students’ laptops, wallets, and phones.
Other freshman dorms and upperclassmen houses have also reported robberies in recent years. Over a single weekend in September 2016, several laptops were taken from Canaday Hall and Stoughton Hall in Harvard Yard as well as Adams House, Mather House and Leverett House along the river.
Last week, HUPD reported that more than $6,000 worth of electronics were stolen from the Dillon Fieldhouse in Allston, home to many varsity sports’ locker rooms, facilities and coaches’ offices.
In 2016, the Undergraduate Council’s Student Life Committee voted unanimously 11-0 in support of installing exterior security cameras outside of residential halls.
Roughly 90 laptops are stolen each year at Harvard University, according to the HUPD website.

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences will debate a motion that advises Harvard to divest its endowment from fossil fuels at its monthly meeting Tuesday, according to an agenda shared with faculty members Friday.
The motion, which will be introduced by English department chair Nicholas J. Watson, would advise the Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — to instruct the Harvard Management Company to withdraw from and no longer pursue investments in companies that “explore for or develop further reserves of fossil fuels.” The proposal also asks the Corporation to replace HMC investment advisers who are “unwilling or unable to comply” with the motion.
Watson wrote in an email that he understands an FAS vote cannot compel the University to divest, but he hopes such a vote would pressure the Corporation to divest.
“We do want to press the Corporation to act, so that Harvard can be near the forefront of this movement, rather than bringing up the rear,” Watson wrote. “In our view, not only is a shift away from fossil fuels urgently necessary for the future of the planet; the only way this shift is going to come about is by taking on the fossil fuel industry directly. If a major research and educational institutional like Harvard isn’t willing to do this, who will be?”
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on Watson’s email, referring to previous statements on divestment.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow, following the precedent of several University presidents, has maintained that the University’s endowment not be used as a tool to enact social change. Instead, he has said that the University must work with industry players to address climate change, among other arguments.
Watson wrote in his email that a group of professors using the name Harvard Faculty for Divestment has been calling for divestment for more than five years. In 2014, the group wrote an open letter to former University President Drew G. Faust and members of the Harvard Corporation urging for fossil fuel divestment.
In a survey administered by The Crimson in May 2018, 67 percent of FAS faculty indicated they support fossil fuel divestment.
Tuesday’s vote marks the culmination of a months-long discussion on climate and divestment that played out in the faculty’s October, November, and December meetings. In December, Watson introduced the motion which the faculty will vote upon on Tuesday.
English professor James T. Engell ’73 proposed an amendment to Watson’s original motion which the faculty will also vote on Tuesday, per the agenda. In it, he suggests that all future endowment investments should be subjected to a “system of decarbonization” in order to achieve emissions reduction goals set by international experts.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Scientists at Harvard and Vanderbilt University released a study Friday showing that only a fraction of stars eventually collide as black holes.
Karan Jani, a co-author of the recent study and postdoctoral fellow at Vanderbilt University, said the motivation for the research came from the understanding that only a certain amount of stars can become black holes and eventually collide, a concept the team called a “stellar budget.”
“The maximum is that every star becomes a black hole. But that’s not true, because the sun is not going to become a black hole,” Jani said. “So there is only a fraction of the stars that can become black holes, and so that’s where we started finding a fraction of how many of them end up being black holes?”
Black holes are born when massive stars collapse into themselves and can go on to orbit and collide into each other. These interactions cause gravitational waves, called “LIGO events” after the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, a laboratory that focuses on tracking gravitational waves in the universe.
The study found that roughly 14 percent of stars collide after becoming black holes. Abraham "Avi" Loeb, a co-author of the study and chair of the Harvard Astronomy department, said researchers compared the birthrate of stars and the rate of LIGO events to arrive at the figure.
“We know the birthrate of stars of all masses, and especially those very massive ones, we know how frequently they are born, per unit volume in the universe,” Loeb said. “Then, we see the LIGO event rate, we see how many events take place per unit time, per unit volume. And we ask, which fraction of the most massive stars, which fraction of them participates in those LIGO events. And by ‘participate,’ I mean two black holes being in a pair that merges [and] comes together because of the emission of gravitational waves.”
Jani said the research will provide a foundational understanding of the production of black holes from stars.
“What our study does is, it is almost like a financial theory of black holes where you have this credit of how many [stars] you can make into black holes and how many of them are out,” Jani said.
Loeb said he thinks the future is bright for other kinds of research involving black holes.
“Altogether, this is really a very exciting time to work on black holes. These are regions of space and time that are the most extreme,” he said. “They are very distorted, and when you get into a black hole, you can never get out. So, they are the ultimate prison.”

On February 9, 2019, United States Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III (D-Mass.) took the stage to carry out a coveted task in Massachusetts politics: introducing U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) — his former Harvard Law School professor — as she officially launched her 2020 presidential campaign.
Greeting him with a hug at the podium was Senator Edward J. Markey, Warren’s counterpart (D-Mass.). Markey, who spoke before Kennedy, praised him for “brilliantly” delivering the Democratic response to President Donald J. Trump’s State of the Union address in 2018.
It was a neat and tidy picture: Massachusetts’ three biggest-name Democrats, united around the common cause of electing Elizabeth Warren president.
The trio’s relationship, however, was about to become far more complicated.
Kennedy, who also introduced Warren at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, declared his former professor to be the “leader who will restore the solidarity that Donald Trump stole.”
Seven months later, Kennedy officially announced that he was kicking off a new candidacy of his own, and running in a Democratic primary to unseat Markey — who Warren had already endorsed.
Still, Kennedy said in an interview with The Crimson last week that he is not disappointed Warren endorsed Markey.
“She had endorsed Senator Markey months before I got in this race and I’m not going to speculate as to what she would have done if the timing was different or if I jumped in the race,” Kennedy said. “I’m grateful for the relationship that I have with her and I’m grateful for her commitment to our state and I’m proud of the race that she’s running for president.”
Warren’s endorsement of Markey came just two days after the New York Times reported in August that Kennedy was considering challenging Markey in the Senate election. Kennedy entered the race roughly a month later, in late September.
Despite lacking Warren’s endorsement, Kennedy has continued to campaign for his former Law School mentor. On the campaign trail, he praises her progressive policies and often recounts his memories of being her student at the Law School. Experts note that Kennedy may benefit politically by tying himself to Warren’s candidacy.
Earlier this month, Kennedy stumped for Warren in New Hampshire, holding two events in Exeter, N.H. and Nashua, N.H. separately.
Making a fervent case for Warren in New Hampshire — a state where he is not on the ballot — Kennedy offered nothing but praise for his former professor and prospective colleague in the Senate.
For Sam Kelley, a Kennedy volunteer and Massachusetts resident who traveled to New Hampshire to knock on doors for Warren, Kennedy’s continued support for Warren — despite her endorsement of Markey — is a testament to his leadership.
“I think Democrats in the end always have each other’s backs,” Kelley said. “And I think with Congressman Kennedy still supporting a candidate that he believes in just shows the kind of leaders we have in Massachusetts.”
Kennedy first met Warren while attending the Law School, where she taught him contracts law and bankruptcy law.
Kennedy told The Crimson that he enrolled in Warren’s bankruptcy class in order to be taught by her.
“I took bankruptcy because she was the teacher — not because I had a binding interest in bankruptcy, but because I knew that she could make me look at it differently and teach me something about it that I wouldn’t otherwise get,” Kennedy said.
At the DNC in 2016, Kennedy told the story of his first day in Warren’s class, when she called on him and he had to admit that he did not know the definition of the word assumpsit.
On the campaign trail in New Hampshire this month, he told a version of the story about his first day.
“The lasting contribution that I will make out of my life in public office is, without question, the fact that if you Google the word assumpsit, my picture comes up,” Kennedy said in Nashua.
In an interview, Kennedy said Warren was a “tough” professor.
“What I think became clear over time was not just that she was tough, that she demanded the most out of her students every day, but that what she asked for was your best effort,” he said.
Warren and Kennedy’s relationship improved after his first day blunder. Abbye J. Atkinson, a law school professor at the University of California Berkeley who was in Warren’s section with Kennedy, said that the relationship between the two was “jovial” in class.
Kennedy recalled that he “spent hours” in Warren’s office studying bankruptcy and contracts law. During one office hour appointment, he said he overheard her hurrying to get off the phone with former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) so that she could make time for his questions.
“I remember very clearly waiting outside her office for office hours and listening to her on the phone trying to get off the phone call,” Kennedy said.
“That’s a pretty amazing thing that she’d be willing to do that — and that she did do that,” he added. “And it’s why I think her students are so devoted to her — because she made every effort to ensure that they got the attention that they needed to get what they deserved. And not every teacher did that.”
Since Kennedy graduated from the Law School in 2009, his career has moved almost in sync with Warren’s path in politics.
Five months after Warren announced her candidacy for Senate in 2012, Kennedy — then a prosecutor for the Middlesex County district attorney’s office — also announced a bid to join the Massachusetts congressional delegation.
Both ultimately prevailed in their first ever races. Kennedy replaced longtime U.S. Representative Barney Frank in the Massachusetts fourth congressional district, and Warren defeated incumbent Republican Scott P. Brown to capture the seat held for decades by Kennedy’s great-uncle, Edward M. “Ted” Kennedy, who died in office in 2009.
Kennedy said in an interview that he and Warren would often consult each other about the difficulties of being rookie candidates.
“We’d obviously trade phone calls all the time and talk it through about the challenge of being first-time candidates,” Kennedy said. “And to be fair, when the Senator ran, the level of scrutiny and attention placed on her was far different the level of scrutiny and attention placed on me.”
“It was an amazing experience to be able to run my first race, obviously, with her at the top of the ticket in Massachusetts,” Kennedy added.
Kennedy and Warren again made leaps together this election cycle, with her running for the presidency and him in his first race for Senate. Kennedy said the two still keep in touch.
“We keep in reasonably consistent contact, particularly given the challenge that she’s got and the places that she’s got to be,” Kennedy said. “But given the challenges that she’s got in front of her, I try to make sure that she has the space she needs to be able to run her race.”
Michelle Wu, another former Warren student who now serves on the Boston City Council, said that Warren is always happy to see a former student thriving in their career.
“I think she’s always especially excited and warm seeing her former students,” said Wu, who has served as a surrogate for Warren in Iowa and New Hampshire. “At heart, she’s a teacher. She just wants all of us that she counts as her students among the generations of young people that she’s had the chance to teach — she just wants all of us to reach our full potential.”
Even for two longtime friends, it is hardly customary for Senate campaigns to send hoards of volunteers and staffers across state lines to knock on doors. Kennedy’s willingness to back Warren, experts say, may stem from both his stated desire for his former professor to win the presidency and his own political interest in Massachusetts.
Asked after the event in Nashua whether he was hoping to win over Warren’s endorsement from Markey, Kennedy was quick to swat the notion down.
“Literally never was once a consideration on my mind,” he said. “For those who have made endorsements in this race long before I got in it, I’ve not asked any single person there to reconsider it.”
Eric P. Lesser ’07, a Kennedy ally and former aide to President Barack Obama, said in an interview that Kennedy’s support for Warren is genuine.
“I think he’s supporting her because he thinks she’d be the best president, which is also the reason I’m supporting her,” Lesser said. “Both Joe and myself have been supporting Elizabeth since day one.”
Some experts, though, observe a political edge to Kennedy’s decision to campaign publicly and strongly for Warren.
“I think that both things are likely to be true — that he has a lot of affinity for Elizabeth Warren, he would like to see her win the nomination and the presidency. But I also think it helps him politically to be seen in Massachusetts as doing everything he can to assist her candidacy,” said Peter N. Ubertaccio, a political science professor at Stonehill College.
How much of a factor Warren’s endorsement will bare in the Senate race remains to be seen. Outside of a minute-and-a-half endorsement video put out by the Markey campaign in which Warren made the case for his re-election, she has largely stayed out of the race.
David A. Hopkins ’99, a Boston College political science professor, said it is still unclear how far Warren will go in supporting Markey, especially as she continues to campaign for the presidency.
“While she has nominally endorsed Markey, what we don’t know is how much energy she will actually put behind supporting Markey in the campaign,” Hopkins said. “Will she campaign hard for him? Will she cut an ad for him? Will she really lead the argument against Joe Kennedy?”
“The longer her presidential candidacy goes on, the less she’s able to really mobilize personally on behalf of Markey,” he added.
In an interview, Kennedy reiterated a campaign strategy that he learned from Warren during the 2012 election. Kennedy said that in their conversations that year, “one of the things that she said repeatedly” is simply that “more is more.”
“The more people that come out, the more people that get engaged, the more people that get activated, the more people that believe in their system and believe they have something to contribute — that cascades up and down a ticket,” Kennedy said.
Kennedy added that part of the lessons learned from 2012 was the importance of engaging more voters across the Democratic ticket — a tactic he is employing today as he campaigns for both himself and Warren.
“Part of our job as candidates is to make sure that you are pulling more people in and you’re challenging them to get engaged and you’re giving them pathways to get engaged,” Kennedy said. “You’re ensuring that the motivating force behind a bigger race can actually spill over into other races and other issues that you care about.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A federal appeals court last month affirmed a district court’s dismissal of a lawsuit by former Harvard associate professor Kimberly S. Theidon, ending her long-running lawsuit alleging that the University unfairly denied her tenure.
Theidon first filed suit against Harvard in 2015, arguing that sex discrimination and retaliation for her advocacy for victims of sexual harassment led to her being denied tenure in the Anthropology department two years prior. United States District Judge Leo T. Sorokin dismissed her case in February 2018, ruling in summary judgement that Theidon did not prove sex discrimination or retaliation.
Theidon filed an appeal to that ruling in March 2018, but on Jan. 22, 2020, a three-judge panel affirmed Sorokin’s decision. The panel’s opinion remained under seal until Friday.
Theidon, who is now a tenured professor at Tufts University, wrote in an emailed statement that the First Circuit ruling marked a “disappointing” end to a “long legal saga.”
“To the young women — and men — who reached out to me: I believe your painful stories, I am sorry for this outcome, and I hold you all in my thoughts,” Theidon wrote.
She added that she believes “systemic gender discrimination and harassment” on college campuses is driving many young women out of academia.
“The black box of tenure, lacking transparency, is precisely how silencing and impunity work to the disadvantage of those who would speak up and unsettle the status quo,” she wrote.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Anna G. Cowenhoven declined to comment on the First Circuit’s ruling or on Theidon’s statement.
Theidon argued in court that there were irregularities in her tenure review process that were evidence of sex discrimination, according to last month’s ruling. The First Circuit judges, however, determined that Theidon failed to adequately prove that claim. Former University President Drew G. Faust testified in a deposition in the case that Theidon failed to make “major contributions to the field of anthropology” that met Harvard’s standards for tenure, per the ruling.
Theidon also claimed she faced a “discriminatory work environment” in the Anthropology department, according to the ruling. In 2008, when Theidon was promoted to associate professor, then-acting chair of the Anthropology department Mary M. Steedly allegedly told Theidon that she would need to behave like a “dutiful daughter” and that her tenure application would be “held to a higher standard” than her male co-workers’ applications, the ruling states.
Theidon also argued she was denied tenure in retalitation for speaking out publicly about sexual harassment and gender discrimination at Harvard. In 2013, Theidon called Harvard a “sexually hostile environment” in the comments section of a Crimson article.
The First Circuit panel wrote in the ruling that there was “no evidence” that the committee evaluating Theidon’s tenure application was aware of her advocacy.
Theidon joined Harvard’s faculty in 2004 and became an associate professor in 2008. She argued in her lawsuit that, prior to being denied tenure, she had received indication that she was in a good position to receive promotion.
“My journey illustrates why women do not come forward; and, this is why we must,” Theidon wrote Friday. “I move forward, thankful to have both my conscience and career intact.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Attacking his opponent, St. Lawrence University’s Belal Nawar, with an onslaught of straight drives and gut-ripping cross-courts, Harvard men’s squash senior captain Sean Hughes sent his opponent scampering into the back corners before finishing off the rally with a vicious forehand kill. His accurate play led him to a hard-fought 3-0 victory over his opponent in the third seed matchup. It was one of Harvard’s nine victories in a sweep of St. Lawrence on Saturday afternoon. The squad has won its last 25 matches dating back to the beginning of last season.
Harvard Junior Adam Corcoron, who played fifth seed, obliterated his St. Lawrence counterpart, conceding just one point in the final game to win his match 3-0, by scores of 11-0, 11-0, and 11-1. Junior Samuel Scherl, who played second seed, won his team-high 23rd match in a row with a 3-0 victory of his own. First-years Ayush Menon and Liam Rotzoll, who played eighth and ninth seed respectively, continued their undefeated starts to the season and improved to a combined 17-0.
Hughes, who has been on the team each of the last four seasons, credits the team’s incredible run of success to its strong work ethic and excellent leadership.
“I think the work ethic that this team has is pretty unparalleled,” Hughes said. “We are coming in twice a day most days and working very hard. We have good guidance from [Head Coach Mike Way], [Associate Head Coach Hameed Ahmed], and [Assistant Coach Luke Hammond], who are very knowledgeable about the game.”
“We [do] a lot of fitness and strength training. And I think we're really deep from one through nine,” added Rotzoll.
In his first game against Nawar, Hughes was caught a little flat-footed by Nawar’s rapid style of play — however, he managed to recover in time to win the game and, eventually, the match.
“I could have come out stronger,” Hughes said. “I think I think I came into it a bit loose and [Nawar] kind of took advantage of that. [Nawar] plays at a very high pace. He came out and was on top of the ball, and I was definitely on the defensive side of things.”
“[But] I locked the court down [at] the end and that worked well,” Hughes added.
The day before its match against St. Lawrence, Harvard’s squad swept its match against the University of Virginia Cavaliers, 9-0. Senior captains Saadeldin Abouaish, Timothy Brownell, and Hughes all won their matches to remain undefeated on the season. Sophomore George Crowne made a successful return to the lineup with a 3-0 trouncing of his UVA opponent in the sixth pairing.
For Brownell, the two victories were especially important because they showed he was fully back in form after missing time due to an injury.
“I was out a lot of the fall with the injury,” said Brownell. “So for me being on court and feeling better and my feet moving around has been a really big part of it. For me, being able to win two matches this weekend against good opponents is a real confidence booster. [I] thought I played well enough and that's just gonna keep the momentum going, rolling forward, because we're gonna have some big matches.”
Harvard will face more stiff competition in its next match, when it faces off against rival and number 2 seed Trinity on Wednesday.
“Trinity is always a tough team every year,” Brownell said. “We're going to try and stay the same [and] we're just going to try and be ourselves play our game on Wednesday. It's going to be [an away match], so it's going to be loud. It's going to be noisy, but I think we're ready.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In back-to-back games this weekend, Harvard women’s basketball hosted the two most dominant teams in recent Ivy League history. Since 2010, Princeton and Penn have traded places for first and second place in the league. Though Harvard (11-6; 2-2 Ivy) has not had its share at the title since 2008 – when it tied with Cornell and Dartmouth — the Crimson bested Penn (10-5; 0-2 Ivy) on Friday evening. The following night, Harvard fell to back-to-back defending Ancient Eight champion Princeton (15-1; 3-0 Ivy).
HARVARD 46, PRINCETON 60
Despite staking out an early 5-0 lead, Harvard could not keep up with Princeton’s marquee players for long.
Princeton came out in a high-pressure woman-to-woman defense, which stifled Harvard’s motion offense. On numerous occasions, Princeton prevented the Crimson from finding opportunities to score, and Harvard was forced to take rushed, last second shots to beat the clock.
“I think that the scout on us is get in our grill,” co-captain and junior forward Rachel Levy said. “I think it's gonna be something we're gonna have to continue to work on...But I think that that's fixable.”
Though Harvard experienced trouble running its offense, the team scored seven consecutive points towards the end of the first frame to cut Princeton’s lead to single digits. Levy called this offensive surge a “crossroads” for the team.
“Our biggest goal is never separate as a team and I think that was a crossroads for us,” she said. “Either they're going to push the lead or we're gonna climb our way back. And we came together and put our heads down and we pushed forward and were able to close that lead, which gave us a lot of gas going in the second half.”
Despite this encouraging run, Princeton senior forward and reigning Ivy Tournament Most Outstanding Performer Bella Alarie responded with a deep three from behind the top of the key to bring her team’s lead back to double digits. Harvard held Alarie, who stands at 6-foot-4 and is being courted by WNBA teams, to 13 points on Saturday night.
Sophomore guard Maggie McCarthy was the lifeblood of Harvard’s effort against Princeton. Leading her team at point guard, McCarthy dished out five assists and shot an efficient three-for-four from behind the arc. Clocking in forty minutes of gametime action, she only conceded two turnovers.
“Maggie McCarthy is my hero,” coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said after Saturday night’s game, in which McCarthy played the entire game after resting for only seven minutes against Penn the night before. “That kid’s got a tough as nails heart.”
In addition to McCarthy, freshman guard Lola Mullaney and senior forward Jeannie Boehm provided needed points to Harvard’s insipid offense. They co-led Harvard in scoring, contributing 10 points each. Both players had inefficient performances, though. Mullaney shot three of ten from downtown, and Boehm went 5 for 14 from the field.
Harvard’s ability to put the ball in the hoop was certainly hindered by the absence of co-captain and senior guard Mackenzie Barta, who went down early in the second quarter after colliding with an opponent. Barta had to be carried off the hardwood by her teammates and did not return for the remainder of the game. Her status is unclear.
In addition to putting the ball in the hoop, Harvard struggled to grab rebounds. Princeton’s starters stood at an average of roughly six feet tall, compared to Harvard’s first five, who average a height of five foot nine. Harvard was outrebounded by Princeton 38 to 23. 
HARVARD 58, PENN 51
Friday evening’s game seemed personal for the Crimson, whose matchups against the Quakers last season were replete with victory, drama, and tragedy.
Harvard’s 29-point loss to Penn at the end of last season was “fresh” on Crimson players’ minds, according to Boehm. In such a way, the win “meant the world” to her and her teammates, she said.
Crimson players were visibly smiling throughout Friday night’s game. They dove on the ground for loose balls, pushed the ball ahead on fastbreaks, and shot with confidence from three-point range.
“I was definitely really excited for this game,” Mullaney, who scored 20 points for the third time in her nascent Ivy League career, said. “Last year they beat us by a lot and we were really ready for this game and it just felt good coming out and getting a lead really quickly.” She scored half of Harvard’s threes, shooting five for eight from behind the arc.
From the post, Boehm put on a dominant performance, recording her fourth double-double of the season. She finished with 16 rebounds and 10 points.
Harvard will continue Ivy League play at home next weekend. The Crimson will face Yale, who is undefeated in league play, at 5 p.m. on Friday. At 4 p.m. on Saturday, Harvard will take the floor at Lavietes Pavilion against Brown, who has yet to pull out a win in conference.

BOSTON — The No. 17 Harvard men’s hockey team began its 68th Beanpot tournament run against No. 12 Northeastern, a matchup that tends to feel more like a Huskies home game than one played on neutral ice. The last time these two teams faced off, in 2017, the Crimson overcame a late Northeastern push to secure a championship game bid, which it then won.
Harvard fans watching for a repeat occurrence would look in vain, however. The Huskies (15-7-2, 8-6-1 HEA) shut down the Crimson (10-7-4, 8-4-3 ECAC) and its powerplay when it mattered most for a 3-1 win. Northeastern will head to the finals looking to capture a third straight Beanpot title next week. Harvard’s lone goal-scorer was sophomore forward Jack Drury; his 14th of the year will be cold comfort as the Crimson heads to the consolation game instead.
“Obviously, it was a hard-fought game,” head coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “Ultimately, they made one more play than we did. We had our chances… I thought [Northeastern graduate-student net-minder Craig] Pantano made some big saves in the second half of the game. I thought our execution wasn’t great.”
Not long into the first, Harvard had its first powerplay opportunity, touching off a battle of the special teams giants. Entering into Monday’s game, the Huskies had the nation’s fourth-ranked penalty kill (89.2%), while the Crimson brought the country’s top powerplay unit (30.7%). Northeastern’s unit kept the Harvard skaters to the perimeter for the start of the penalty, disrupting passes in key areas.
Then freshman forward Nick Abruzzese found sophomore linemate Jack Drury at the goal mouth. Rather than continuing to cycle the puck, Drury spun around and roofed it over the right shoulder of graduate student net-minder Craig Pantano.
Drury’s tally is the latest in a nine-game scoring streak, over the course of which he has 18 points to his name. The score also marked the first time the Crimson has broken the ice in its Beanpot semifinal since its 2017 championship run.
Harvard held onto its early lead for less than seven minutes. The special teams statistics weren’t nearly as impressive the other way — the Huskies came in with a 21.2 percent strike rate on the man-advantage, while the Crimson held a penalty-kill efficiency of 80.8%. 22 seconds into the penalty, Northeastern captain Ryan Shea fired a shot from the blue line, and junior forward Zach Solow tipped it past Harvard rookie goaltender Mitchell Gibson to tie the contest.
“We had a bend, don’t break mentality, and it served us well,” said Northeastern head coach Jim Madigan.
The teams continued to trade chances through the opening frame; the score, however, remained a 1-1 stalemate. Though the Huskies had outshot the Crimson, 13-6, in the period, Harvard had seen a solid offensive push towards the end of the first.
In the middle frame, Harvard managed more zone time and more possession. Indeed, the squad would end up outshooting Northeastern, 8-4, in those 20 minutes, bringing the overall shot differential much closer. At the same time, the Huskies’ fewer shots were high-quality chances; Gibson had to remain sharp to keep the score even. In a game with few whistles overall, Harvard incurred two penalties in the second — infractions that would cost the team before the second intermission.
Harvard’s first second-period penalty kill went far better than its earlier man-down play. The Huskies had little time and space in the offensive zone, and critical clears allowed Harvard to escape unscathed. A late-period penalty, however, undid the effects of that kill and Harvard’s own offensive time.
With time nearly expiring on the powerplay, Northeastern rookie forward Riley Hughes collected the puck behind the goal line and tossed it in front of Gibson. While the net-minder stopped senior forward Grant Jozefek’s stuff attempt, senior Brendan van Riemsdyk picked up the change and found the back of the net.
“We should’ve had [the goal mouth] covered,” coach Donato said. “It was the end of the powerplay, but we’d got our fifth guy on the ice, so we really had no reason not to have the front of the net covered. We weren’t in penalty-killing mode.”
Van Riemsdyk’s second goal of the season put his team up 2-1 with only 30 seconds left in the frame. A last-second powerplay for Harvard was poor consolation. When the teams returned to the ice, though, the refs whistled the Huskies for hitting from behind, giving Harvard a golden 5-on-3 opportunity.
But the NCAA’s best man-advantage unit was overcome here by Northeastern’s shutdown penalty kill. To the delight of the raucous Huskies student section, Harvard could not capitalize on its chances — much as the story had been in the second.
“We had some hesitancy to shoot the puck,” said captain Nathan Krusko of the powerplay. “I felt like as the game went on we were very reluctant to take pucks to the hard areas…. We had some good looks [and] we can tip our hats to the goalie, but we have to find ways to cash in if we want to win those big games.”
Around the halfway mark of the period, Harvard’s desperation spiked, and the team threw everything and the kitchen sink at Pantano’s net. Harvard attempted 31 shots in that frame, half of which were on target and gobbled up by the net-minder. In contrast, the Huskies attempted just 11, preferring to crowd their own zone to protect their lead.
Several of those Harvard chances were a hair’s breadth away from goals — sophomore Casey Dornbach shot into a defenseman’s skates at the side of the cage, and, on another occasion, threw the puck behind Pantano through the blue paint. Sophomore Jack Rathbone, returning from injury, beat Pantano on a wrap-around try but once again, the puck did not cross the goal line.
The action wasn’t only at the Northeastern end of the ice. The Huskies had some grade-A opportunities of their own, but Gibson turned away all the pucks he faced in the final frame, giving his team another boost in its quest for a comeback.
With two minutes left in regulation, Harvard pulled Gibson in favor of rookie forward John Farinacci in the hopes of finding that elusive tying goal. As with the 5-on-3, however, Northeastern broke up plays in key areas and largely neutralized Harvard’s offensive threats.
The dagger came with less than a minute left. Blocking a shot in his own zone, Shea flipped the puck towards Harvard’s empty net. The rolling biscuit only just made it into the cage, padding the Huskies’ lead and effectively ending Harvard’s chances.
“Honestly, I wasn’t shooting for the net,” Shea said. “I kind of just flipped it out just to...regroup, but it caught [an] edge a little bit… Once it went in, I was like, ‘Here we go, we’re going back to the championship.’”
Harvard had played 10 of the previous 11 Beanpot consolation games heading into Monday’s matchup — and, unfortunately for the team, it will play another come next week. The last Harvard class that has won a Beanpot title will graduate this spring, and fans will have to set their sights on next year’s Boston hockey classic.

Once upon a time, there was just one singular biology concentration at Harvard, much like at many universities in the country. But times have changed. With so many biologies to choose from, how do we keep track of them all? Using Harvard’s most notorious “celebs,” of course.
Neuroscience (formerly Neurobiology): David Malan
With the highest number of concentrators, Neurobiology is the CS50 of Harvard Biology. Neurobiology attracts students for its flexibility and applicability to disciplines from chemistry, psychology, and economics.
Human Developmental and Regenerative Biology (HDRB): Larry Bacow 
The newest addition to the Harvard Biology concentration family, HDRB has quickly risen through the ranks when it comes to popularity.
Molecular and Cellular Biology (MCB): Dean Rakesh Khurana
Your classic, lovable, and dependable biology, MCB is the OG biology concentration. It’s also the second most popular, but HDRB might be giving MCB a run for its money.
Integrative Biology (IB): Andrew Berry
Not only is the vivacious Andrew Berry the Integrative Biology concentration adviser, he also embodies the philosophy of IB in allowing students to pursue any discipline that relates to biology: everything from physics to zoology to botany is fair game.
Chemical and Physical Biology (CPB): Your Expos 20 Preceptor
The chemistry and physics of biology (if that wasn’t already clear), so obviously it’s unnecessarily complicated – just like your 12-page final Expos paper. CPB is the smallest biology concentration at Harvard, so you’ll get to know your classmates very well as you slog through those extra math classes.
Human Evolutionary Biology (HEB): Greg Mankiw
For the econ snakes hiding amongst biology concentrators, waiting to reveal their true selves come recruiting season. Can anyone say behavioral econ?
Fear not if you can’t find yourself among the biology concentrations; not everyone was meant to live and breathe Science Center Hall B.
