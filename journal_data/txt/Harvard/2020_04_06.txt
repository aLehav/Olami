Editors' Note: The Fuller Craft Museum is closed due to COVID-19 for the foreseeable future. This article was written before the closure.
In honor of its 50th anniversary, the Fuller Craft Museum — located in Brockton, Massachusetts — has crafted a multifaceted, gold-themed exhibit to display their artistic achievements throughout the past half-century.
Beth McLaughlin, the chief curator at Fuller Craft Museum, explained why the museum chose gold as a medium.
“It was a really powerful media to honor our history and all the accomplishments that we've had over the 50 years that we've been here,” McLaughlin said.
The past 50 years have been transformative for Fuller Craft, which has grown from a general art museum to, in the past 15 years, a craft-specific outlet.
“So this was a great opportunity for us to present both works from the fine art world and the craft world to really capture our full history,” McLaughlin said.
Suzanne Ramljak, the exhibit’s co-curator, further explained the significance behind the selection of gold.
“The multiplicity of materials and the media and approaches that represent the museum's history are also combined with the multiple perspectives and associations that gold carries,” Ramljak said. “So you'll hear me say there's not just one gold there, there are multiple golds: many shades of gold, many meanings and functions of gold throughout cultural history… gold functions in positive and negative ways throughout history.”
Gold in all forms, shades, and styles adorns the walls of “Striking Gold: Fuller at Fifty,” weaved into fabrics and jewelry, melded with porcelain and other materials. However, another, less-familiar use of the material is also interlaced into the exhibit: “dirty” gold and golden guns. The exhibit aims not only to celebrate the accomplishments of the museum, but also to evoke deeper discussion. According to McLaughlin, it strives to make visitors question previously held perspectives and engage in a more active viewing experience.
This more personalized viewing also extends to another exhibit within Fuller Craft Museum, “Serious Bling: Radical Jewelry Makeover —The Artist Project.” “Serious Bling” demonstrates 32 unique, striking pieces of jewelry, and invites viewers to reevaluate how they perceive the impact of their actions upon the wider world. The project, curated by Susie Ganch, tackles its goal in an unconventional way: through hand-crafted jewelry remade from recycled materials.
Ganch explained that her project means to address the problem of sustainability and bring about more meaning to the jewelry items that consumers wear. In addition, the exhibit provides artists from around the world with the opportunity to create art from already existing materials.
“People don't really think about jewelry that much,” Ganch said. “Jewelry is something you put on and you forget about, but somebody made it. And it's made because of a reason... We're trying to give it as much exposure and attract as many people to it as possible. Because in part, we're trying to say, maybe you don't need a lot of jewelry. Maybe you need a few really great things.”
This message of renewability speaks to a more economically and ecologically friendly approach to designing jewelry, one many consumers have already bought into.
When asked about the personal significance behind the pieces — especially for those designing them — Ganch brought the idea of narrative into the spotlight.
“Some of that artwork in there is imbued with sentimentality and narrative, but a lot of the artists are not imbuing a new narrative,” she said. “They're actually accepting an aesthetic from the previous life of the material they've selected, and maybe not dealing with the donor’s story … When the donor gives us their jewelry and they tell a story about why they gave it to us, artists choose to use it or not.”
According to Ganch, the goals of “Serious Bling” are sustainability and accessibility, particularly accessibility to a new conception of artistry. Each jewelry piece has not only been crafted with precision and the intent to remake the materials themselves, but also with the intent to reconstruct the minds of those who are willing to listen. At the Fuller Craft Museum, this transformation has already begun.

Like a bride walking across the aisle, Katy Perry’s first single of 2020, “Never Worn White,” is introduced by the familiar tune of the classic “Wedding March.” The song is heartfelt yet undeniably poppy — Perry leaves her emotions for the lyrics.
Focusing on her engagement to and pregnancy with Orlando Bloom, “Never Worn White” is Perry’s exploration of the idea of marriage and her reservations about the commitment it entails. The marriage references are clear throughout — in the song’s music video, through which she announced her pregnancy, she even wears a wedding gown that reveals her baby bump.
“'Cause I've never worn white / But I wanna get it right / Yeah, I really wanna try with you,” she sings in the song’s chorus, revealing her desire to marry Bloom and have a successful relationship with him, while also hinting at the pressure she feels to have a successful marriage with the man who was “Man enough to come / Answer [her] mama's prayers.”
With her lyrics, Perry throws herself wholeheartedly into the relationship, letting her mind wander to the “full family tree” she hopes to have with Bloom. She also recognizes the difficulties it could bring, singing that she would give her “Blood sweat and tears / To reach [their] destiny.” At the same time, a chorus of harmonizing vocalists repeat “I do” in the background, reaffirming Perry’s commitment despite the struggles ahead.

In “Never Worn White,” gone seem to be the standard radio-friendly gimmicks that ran rampant in Perry’s most recent releases such as her 2019 single “Harleys in Hawaii” and 2017 album “Witness.” Instead, “Never Worn White” showcases Perry’s vocals in the best way, allowing her voice to rise effortlessly above a simple piano melody. The song imitates a style that has been growing in popularity with songs such as Kesha’s “Praying” and Demi Lovato’s “Anyone.” In this way, Perry lends her voice to the growing trend of strong female pop stars breaking from their generally upbeat repertoire in exchange for the confessional ballad. In doing so, she shows her voice is strong enough to carry a song without her traditional ensemble of autotune and synth-heavy backgrounds, turning a pregnancy announcement and its seemingly candid lyrics into a genuine hit.

Do you listen to 100 gecs? It’s the question all the cuffed-jeans-kids are asking.
Since the 2019 release of their breakthrough album “1000 gecs,” 100 gecs, the experimental duo comprised of Laura Les and Dylan Brady, have risen to cult stardom. Their music is fun. It’s catchy. It simultaneously embraces and challenges the pop genre with its nonchalant maximalism and absurdist momentum — take, for example, the song “gecgecgec,” in which the only lyric for the first half of the track is the syllable “gec,” repeated with rhythm-defying irregularity.
100 gecs released a remix last month of one of their most popular songs, “ringtone.” The song features Charli XCX, Rico Nasty, and Kero Kero Bonito, three mainstream artists with the power to catapult 100 gecs into the hearts and Spotify queues of their larger fan bases.
In the remix, 100 gecs are, like, 75 gecs — they tone down some of the more grating processing effects used at the end of the original version of “ringtone” and in many of their other songs. The transitions lack the build and release of tension that the climax of the original “ringtone” does so well; rather, one verse stops and another begins as if each singer is passing off a baton to the next. Without the original song’s nonstop energy, the more relaxed transitions create a feeling of spontaneous conversation perfectly suited to a collaborative project. 100 gecs posted a video for the remix on YouTube in which Les and Brady pass paper cutouts of their collaborators’ heads taped to popsicle sticks back and forth, illustrating which artists are featured at any given time. When Les, her voice distorted by autotune, asks, “Wait, Charli, can you sing the chorus again please?” we are reminded once again of the song’s fun, collaborative vibe.
The highlight of the remix is easily Rico Nasty’s verse. In the middle of the song, the beat cuts out and the rapper picks up with a change of pace. “I think I might be addicted to your kisses,” she sings, to swelling static and a rhythm unlike any other in the song. The production mirrors the rap-metal style of her more recent albums. Likewise, Kero Kero Bonito’s verses sound about as Kero-Kero-Bonito as one could imagine, with whimsical pop vocals and the occasional ring of a telephone in the background.
The song succeeds as a remix in that 100 gecs manage to build upon their original “ringtone” without replacing it. The “ringtone” remix may be a more laid-back, less processed version of the original — but it’s no less fun.

Reality competition shows depend equally on their hosts and their contestants, and though “Making the Cut” delivers on the former, it falls painfully short on the latter.
“Making the Cut” is Amazon Prime Video’s newest fashion-forward television show. The premise: Twelve aspiring designers attempt to produce showstopping looks under a time crunch (in the pilot, in a mere 58 hours) to satisfy the tastes of the judges. Each week, one designer is eliminated and another is crowned the winner. The designer that makes it through the finale earns a million dollars, a collection sold on Amazon, and a mentor to help grow their label.
The show leans heavily on its hosts, Tim Gunn and German supermodel Heidi Klum, who are reality television stars as emblematic as Lisa Vanderpump or Lauren Conrad. Gunn and Klum were also the cornerstones of “Project Runway,” the smash-hit series following a similar blueprint: wannabe designers, frantic sketching and sewing, and critical judges. (Who could forget Michael Kors and his sidekick spray tan as he loomed ominously in the shadows of the runway, accompanied by that sinister soundtrack?)
In many ways, “Making the Cut” and “Project Runway” are virtually indistinguishable from one another, save that the imitation fails to quite live up to the glory of the original. As in “Project Runway,” Gunn strolls in halfway through the challenge in an impeccably-tailored suit to consult his pupils. After a whopping two days, one of the contestants inevitably has a mental breakdown due to homesickness, but fortifies themselves after a restorative — and tearful — call home. Another competitor remains fatally firm in their flawed style opinions in front of a panel of accomplished judges.
There are, of course, some differences. The designers in “Making the Cut” are more international than in “Project Runway” — while seven are from the United States, others are from Germany, Italy, Israel, Belgium, and Malaysia, and another was born in Seoul before moving to Oklahoma. The designers are also more established than most of the fledgling aspirants of “Project Runway;” all have already founded their own label, and many have shown at fashion weeks worldwide.
Perhaps the largest deviation from the plot of “Project Runway” is the incorporation of invisible seamstresses. This is a design show, Klum and Gunn stress, not a sewing competition. Though the contestants on “Project Runway” were expected to both design and sew their own clothes, the hopefuls on “Making the Cut” must do only the former before sending their patterns off to assistants. The show offers not a question of tailoring so much as one of the concept behind the cloth. This idea is, admittedly, better than the original — it allows for fashion designers to do what they do best (design), rather than to spend their time agonizing over a crooked seam.
But the notion suffers from poor execution, as the contestants fell largely flat on-screen. The producers of “Making the Cut” clearly forgot the cardinal rule of good reality TV: It’s not a matter of talent, but of memorability. Everyone remembers Tiffany Richardson, the contestant who inspired Tyra Banks’s unforgettable “We were all rooting for you!” speech in Cycle Four of “America’s Next Top Model.” Richardson couldn’t model professionally to save her life, but this, Banks recognized, was not the point. What mattered was that Richardson pronounced “magenta” as “magnetic” and then threw a fit in front of the cameras.
Not one of the contestants are standouts, at least as of the premiere. No one is truly funky, or zany, or spectacular: All seem to be relatively well-adjusted human beings, at least as creatives go, which makes for good business but less-than-superb television. Moreover, many of their designs — while technically fashionable — are not necessarily fun to watch. The runway show at the end of the premiere’s episode featured little black dress after little black dress.
That said, Gunn and Klum are, as ever, delectable hosts. Klum grows older every year — and her hair extensions longer — but her supermodel gloss never really fades. Her sophistication is the perfect match to Gunn’s charming, high-collared gentility. Any man that uses “titillating” unironically in conversation, as Gunn does in the premiere, is made for reality TV.
The problem at the heart of “Making the Cut,” though, is that even the judges — Naomi Campbell, Nicole Richie, Carine Roitfeld, and Joseph Altuzarra — are far more interesting and dramatic than the competitors. Richie’s handful of lines were more noteworthy than the first two-thirds of the episode, which both attests to Richie’s history as a successful reality TV star in her own right (appearing alongside former bestie Paris Hilton on “The Simple Life”) and the doldrums of the competition itself.
All this is not to say that “Making the Cut” is wholly irredeemable. The show benefits from what its predecessor lacked: a virtually unencumbered budget. Amazon Prime, gifted with Jeff Bezos’s bottomless bank account, revamps shows with alacrity. In this sense, the producers have taken full advantage of their opportunities, equipping themselves with shiny new studios and castwide flights to Paris.
Still, the question remains to be seen as to whether “Making the Cut” will develop what ultimately made “Project Runway” — at least for the first eight or nine of seventeen seasons — timeless: a personality. After all, it’s a show about fashion, which is art in its own right. It should be colorful, not black-and-white.

Don’t ask me what I’m even doing here, she says. My life is a series of real-life Wikipedia spirals. Just keep looking up related readings. Couldn’t tell you how my initial research landed me here.
“Here” is a remote corner of the library where it’s impossible to tell the time of day, where light is weak but vision is somehow clear. The books are dusty, long untouched, and we aren’t disturbed as she flits through the shelves in search of pertinent material. I sit at the empty table to wait.
She talks to me over her shoulder. I read somewhere that the release of this one dumb American comedy in the ’80s was linked to the fall of the Soviet Union, she says. Not any movie to do with politics or war — I mean, I imagine they kept most of those out, you know. But they let this one release. Kind of a crazy theory, but looking into that stuff, it’s intriguing, isn’t it? Things we don’t even think about, in our media, things different people can see differently based on societal context and—
She stops, blushes. Sorry, she says. You don’t want to hear about this. Stupid stuff.
This isn’t for a class, is it?
Nah. She laughs. My concentration’s still biology, for med school, technically. Knowing a lot about ’80s comedy movies doesn’t really open doors. Biology gets you lab jobs and research positions and summer internships. And, you know, you’re a doctor by the end of the road.
Is that what you want?
What a question. She laughs again — not quite as hard this time — and turns back to the shelves.
When there’s more to the truth, I’m pretty good at hearing it. I’ve learned when to let it come out on its own. Once I might have tried to push the issue, but now I just sit back, let her pull down a book and scan the first few pages; I know reality is filtering its way through the back of her mind.
She’s not satisfied with the first book or the second. The third, though, she lays down on the table before turning to face me again.
You’re wondering why I’m such a procrastinator, she says, like it’s a given. Why I spend all my time with stuff that doesn’t matter when I’m barely scraping through my classes. When midterms are shaping up to be a nightmare. You’re wondering why I lose sleep over this, spend my nights and weekends in the library, when it’s not going to help me one iota in the long run.
Why do you?
I can’t tell you, she says. She lowers her head and stares down at the table’s cracked varnish. Only I like it. And the instinct is, liking something is a good reason to do it, right? Or is that the way a kid thinks? Am I a kid? Should I stop being one, if I am? Am I being short-sighted?
She looks at me like she expects me to answer, but I don’t, of course.
I got into Harvard, she says, and that means I have this whole world of opportunity spread out in front of me. I have this sparkling education and this lucrative, fulfilling future career and all I need to do is just take it. Pay attention, do my work, grind through the painful lectures and psets. I got myself through high school, didn’t I? And I chose this. I knew what I was doing and I chose this.
There isn’t really a follow-up question to that. I wait.
Finally she takes a deep breath, exhales, and settles her hands back on the book she picked out. Here’s the thing about the ’80s, she says. Why do we want them back so badly? It’s not just personal nostalgia. Plenty of the people watching “Stranger Things” weren’t even alive back then. It’s some sort of cultural thing, that’s the point. And it’s not logical at all. So little of what we like in media is logical. It’s all about these tenuous emotional connections we form with things without even being aware of them, these versions of the past we construct, and these versions of the world in general, because —
She cuts herself off again. The excitement warming up in her voice drops out abruptly. Her laugh is quiet as she looks away. Sorry, she says. You’re not writing about any of that, you don’t care. Just got carried away.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly every conversation among Harvard students has been dominated by the view that returning home is a negative. We’ve heard that time zones, internet access, family situations, and even sheer boredom will make this semester difficult to complete. These are serious concerns, and it is to the College’s credit that it has taken steps to alleviate them.
In these dark times, however, there’s also a silver lining.
Right now, more Harvard students are likely at home than at any time since before we started college. There are no internships to run off to, no research projects to stay on campus for, no vacations to experience with our friends. Instead, we are back in the places where we started. At home, with our parents, siblings, and perhaps friends, we are spending more time with the people who turned us into who we are today.
These few months are a special opportunity. We have the opportunity to marry the aspirations and values that originally inspired us before entering Harvard with the knowledge and determination that we have gained in school.
Our homes remind us of our common humanity. Behind our math psets and social studies readings are the same mundane concerns that bind us to everyone else. We are spread out around every corner of the globe, but we share the same anxieties about the wellbeing of our families amid social distancing and uncertainties over our collective futures. We might take this time to pause and consider ourselves as part of a larger whole.
When we do so, we can appreciate that there truly is a story behind each of us. The annoying background noises in our Zoom classes tell those stories — the struggles, challenges, and proud moments that paved our meandering paths to Harvard. We could all take some time to appreciate the screaming siblings, unkempt beds, and oddly colored walls behind our peers in class. These little quirks pierce through the aura of exceptionalism which on campus can make Harvard feel like an impersonal ivory tower.
Perhaps that is the greatest irony of social distancing: that in this moment of intense isolation, we actually recognize the self-preoccupation that characterizes our college lives. On campus, we find ourselves so busy with the next exam, the next paper deadline, and the next interview that we take our classmates and roommates for granted. Now, when we have the privilege of near-infinite time — by Harvard standards, that is — to focus on those mundane problems, we often find ourselves longing for the affirming presence of our peers.
On campus, amid the hullabaloo of classes, thesis writing, and internship searches, we often see our successes and struggles at Harvard as a distinct phase in our life, separate from our upbringing. It’s as if walking through Johnston Gate clears the canvas of our life so a new set of pastels can color our future. Now, the advent of coronavirus is forcing us to reconcile these two versions of ourselves.
Many can probably relate to the way we both thought, before we started as freshmen, that our Harvard education would help us change the world. Yet despite these aspirations, the effect of college has been to tamp down these passions in favor of supposedly more realistic and achievable pursuits. This time at home might remind us of the limitless potential that our starry-eyed teenage selves dreamed of fulfilling.
Harvard is indeed a transformative place, but too much time there can be stifling. Returning home has given us clarity to think about what kind of people we are and what values we want to hold for ourselves. While we reflect on our present and our past, we might also ponder what those values hold for the future.
When we eventually graduate into the uncertainty of the world changed by the coronavirus, this reminder of what we wanted to do and who we wanted to be can help guide us, not just through the choices we make at Harvard, but also through the rest of our lives.
Etched above Dexter Gate are famous words that have inspired generations of students before us. As we enter Harvard Yard, the gate tells us: “Enter to grow in wisdom.” As we exit onto Massachusetts Avenue, it reminds us: “Depart to serve better thy country and thy kind.” The years we’ve spent at Harvard have hopefully given us some wisdom. The hours we now spend at our childhood desks give us ample time to think about how to use that wisdom to serve the communities that shape us, now and in the future. We are a product of both our Harvard experience and our childhoods at home.

Is humanity prepared for an extinction-level event?
No, I’m not referring to the coronavirus. As devastating as this current pandemic is, it doesn’t pose an existential threat to humanity. But imagine a deadlier virus were to emerge — one with a 100% fatality rate. Or an asteroid impact? Or a nuclear holocaust? Is our species prepared?
To protect the human race against extinction, one proposal that has been floated by scientists and science fiction authors alike is to establish human settlements on other planets; a multi-planetary species is far more resistant to extinction than a uni-planetary one. The most realistic candidate for a human colony is Mars.
I’ve already written a piece arguing that terraforming Mars — molding the planet to be as Earthlike as possible — is an unrealistic and undesirable goal. But, at least on paper, establishing a human settlement on Mars sounds far more feasible than terraforming the entire planet. So, in light of the recent reminder of the fragility of the human species, let us seriously consider the idea of a Martian colony. Specifically, what obstacles — both scientific and ethical — might stand in the way of forming a successful colony?
Let’s start with the natural first question: Is it even possible to transport humans and goods to Mars en masse? As of right now it’s not, but the research is promising. Two massive rockets, NASA’s Space Launch System and SpaceX’s Starship, are currently in development, both with the capacity to carry over a hundred tons of payload into orbit. But a successful colony will need lots of material; Elon Musk suggests sending up Starships in fleets of 1,000. It will take time and money for SpaceX to amass such a fleet, but it’s certainly possible.
But another question remains: Are there enough volunteers to live on Mars?
At first glance, it seems like there are. When the now-bankrupt company Mars One announced that it wanted to build the first Martian settlement, a reported 202,586 people applied. Given humanity’s innate curiosity, I’m not surprised by this level of interest. However, I fear that the public isn’t fully aware of the dangers of life on Mars.
We all know that Mars lacks a breathable atmosphere. But did you know that Mars is sometimes enveloped by planet-wide dust storms that can last for weeks? Or that the Martian soil is full of toxic chemicals? What about the fact that the planet’s low gravity may degrade our bones, muscles, and other bodily systems? Worst of all, did you know that Mars’ radiation levels are over ten times higher than Earth’s, and that just flying to Mars and back would expose an astronaut to 60 percent of the recommended lifetime radiation dose?
If you didn’t know these facts, I don’t blame you — space companies benefit from the propagation of a romantic vision of Mars that downplays the grim realities of life on that planet. For a colony to be successful, though, far more time and money will need to be spent researching solutions — either medical or technological — to the numerous health risks that I’ve mentioned.
I suspect that, even if these risks were widely known, there would still be enough adventurous souls to fill up a colony on Mars. And, since the purpose of the colony is to be a stronghold for humanity in case of disaster, we should hope that these volunteers would be representative of us as a species — a mix of our diverse values, faiths, and backgrounds.
Unfortunately, that’s unlikely to be the case. If NASA gets us to Mars first, then we can expect that most of Mars’ settlers will be college-educated American citizens. On the other hand, SpaceX seems happy to send any interested person to Mars — that is, anyone who can afford the roughly $500,000 ticket. (Musk floated the idea of a loan that could be paid back through labor on Mars — in other words, futuristic indentured servitude.)
Furthermore, for any colony to be truly self-sufficient, these colonists will need to mate and form a new generation of colonists. Is it ethical for living humans to force their unborn descendants to live on Mars, when those future lives will likely be characterized by hardship and suffering? I would argue that it’s not, unless near-future breakthroughs solve all of Mars’ significant health risks. But even then, there will be the unaddressed psychological toll of growing up millions of miles from the planet where 99.9 percent of your species lives, while being forced to learn about blue oceans and green forests that you may never see.
Clearly, the idea of colonizing Mars is fraught with ethical questions. But global crises like the coronavirus pandemic remind us of the frailty of our species, and the threat of human extinction could outweigh the numerous costs of a Martian settlement. Of course, there are some clear arguments against sending humans to Mars; however, given that many influential members of society already support interplanetary colonization, it’s probably going to happen regardless of what you or I believe.
That being said, a successful Mars colony should be planned out with input from all sectors of humanity, not just wealthy technocrats. So, I hope that people from all sorts of backgrounds will offer their perspective on the colonization of Mars, and that they’ll do it soon — before the Red Planet looks like the new Beverly Hills.

The School of Engineering and Applied Sciences announced that new international research appointments will not be offered before Oct. 1, 2020 in a newsletter update sent to SEAS affiliates Thursday.
The announcement comes in light of U.S. consular office closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The update cited uncertainty surrounding timing of consular office reopenings and handling of visa applications as the reason for delaying international research appointments.
According to the SEAS website, approximately 70 percent of SEAS academic hires and appointments are “foreign nationals.” International SEAS appointments and hires usually coordinate with the Harvard International Office to obtain visas and proper documentation for working in the U.S.
Ke Li, a postdoctoral fellow in Environmental Science and Engineering, wrote in an emailed statement that he was surprised to hear the announcement. He wrote that while the announcement will not affect current international researchers at Harvard, including himself, it will discourage prospective international postdocs and students from coming to Harvard.
Li added that although he is unsure of exactly what impact the update will have on research conducted by SEAS and Harvard, he anticipates it “will not be marginal.”
Li wrote that he knows of several colleagues that will now have to wait to pursue research opportunities due to the uncertainty surrounding visa applications.
“Some of my friends who have been offered to do postdoc or visiting student research have to hold their breath, because they don’t know when the visa application will be reopened,” Li wrote.
Tianguang Lu, a postdoctoral fellow in SEAS and another current international researcher, explained that while this announcement would not affect his own research, prospective visiting students and scholars may lose the chance to conduct research abroad at Harvard.
“If Harvard delays appointments, they may have to choose another option because they have funding limitations on their schedule,” Lu said. “Most of the visiting students, for example, they choose to visit abroad because they may have one or two years left to graduate. If they can’t do it now, they may never have this experience, so they may choose another option.”
Lu said he does not know at this time the extent to which this announcement might affect the overall Harvard research community.
The SEAS Office for Faculty Affairs did not respond to a request for comment.
In the newsletter, SEAS Communications provided a link where Harvard affiliates can submit questions regarding COVID-19. Representatives from SEAS and the FAS Division of Science answer these questions on a daily basis.
The newsletter also encouraged SEAS affiliates to contact the Office for Faculty Affairs with questions regarding the international research appointment announcement.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard students have transitioned to online instruction for the remainder of the semester in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, undergraduates enrolled in dual-degree music programs say they have faced a number of interruptions to their coursework.
Harvard’s dual-degree programs allow students to simultaneously enroll in the College and either the Berklee College of Music or the New England Conservatory. Participants earn a four-year bachelor’s degree at Harvard and stay on for an extra fifth year at one of the partner colleges to obtain a master’s degree.
Evan L. Vietorisz ’20, a student in the Harvard/NEC program, said because Harvard announced it would dismiss students before NEC, dual-degree students were left temporarily uncertain of how arrangements would be made for them.
“NEC dismissed its students a few days after Harvard did, so temporarily the dual degree program participants were wondering if and how we would remain in Boston if NEC did not cancel in-person classes,” Vietorisz said. “This quickly became a moot point, though.”
Eric A. Tarlin ’21, a student in the Harvard/Berklee program, said he feels his classes at Berklee have experienced more interruptions than those at Harvard since moving online.
“The fact that Berklee is a performance-based music school means that its classes’ formats were more drastically affected by the COVID-19 epidemic,” Tarlin said. “My Berklee ensemble, private lessons, and recital workshop all involved playing together with other people, in real time, which is simply impossible with the latency of video chatting.”
Tarlin also mentioned that the move off-campus created challenges for juniors in the dual-degree program who needed to audition for graduate programs this spring.
“As a second semester junior, this spring was supposed to be an opportunity for me to really hone in on what Berklee graduate programs I wanted to aim for,” he said. “Now, the process is delayed, and my class won’t have the luxury of a live audition and live accompaniment.”
Avanti Nagral ’20 — a student in the Harvard/Berklee program who is currently taking her classes virtually from Mumbai, India — said she is “functioning on an EST schedule courtesy classes,” but nonetheless remains optimistic about online learning. She added that the changes have simplified the logistics of moving between campuses.
“The only thing that has changed for me beyond the time zone, but I think for everybody generally, is when we were in Boston, doing this program involved a lot of travel back-and-forth,” Nagral said. “And I guess that travel has now completely been cut out — we can just log into Zoom, or Webex, or whatever, one after another.”
Jennifer Baker ’21, a student in the Harvard/Berklee program, said that while the transition to virtual instruction has posed challenges, faculty at both institutions “have been very accommodating and flexible.”
“I am particularly impressed with how my performance-based classes at both Harvard and Berklee have transitioned so well to online learning,” Baker said. “Navigating the transition to virtual instruction has been difficult for performance classes, but overall it has worked better than I expected.”
Vietorisz said faculty at NEC have also been supportive of dual-degree program participants, noting that instructors have become more flexible when assessing students’ work.
“This is especially important because people who do creative media are often expected to work more during times of crisis because of the idea that the stress of the moment fuels creativity,” Vietorisz said. “This is true for some people, but not others, and NEC has made it clear that both responses to the current situation are okay.”
Grading policies at all three schools have reflected the increased flexibility that Vietorisz observed: Harvard has adopted a universal emergency SAT-UNSAT system, Berklee has instituted an opt-in pass-no credit system for all classes, and NEC is offering a pass-fail option for courses other than studio lessons.
Tarlin said that because the two schools’ grading systems operate entirely separately throughout the dual-degree program, differences between the College and Berklee’s new policies will not affect his Harvard transcript.
Jennifer C. Caraluzzi, who serves as the program manager of graduate studies at Berklee, wrote in an email that she has encouraged dual-degree students to maintain “a sense of control in their daily lives in this difficult time.”
“Although there’s so much uncertainty right now, we can only encourage them to approach this one day at a time,” Caraluzzi said. “One of the main messages I have tried to communicate to the students is that we will continue to make music and grow as artists despite these unique circumstances.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Amid nationwide reports of so-called “Zoombombing,” Harvard University Information Technology will activate password protection by default on all Harvard meetings held over Zoom beginning Wednesday.
HUIT will also restrict the ability to share one’s screen with other meeting participants to the host by default, HUIT spokesperson Tim Bailey wrote in an emailed statement.
The novel coronavirus pandemic has forced work and teaching at Harvard online — much of it to the videoconferencing platform Zoom. As the number of Zoom users across the world has skyrocketed, the company has faced criticism over its privacy and cybersecurity features.
Companies and schools nationwide have faced incidents of so-called “Zoombombing,” in which uninvited individuals enter a meeting and share inappropriate or hateful material through Zoom’s audio or screen-sharing functions.
In response, Zoom and even the FBI have encouraged users to make meetings private by requiring a password or enabling a waiting room setting to vet attendees before they enter the meeting. In a March 20 blog post, the company provided tutorials on its privacy features and encouraged users not to share meeting links publically or on social media.
Out of more 73,000 meetings conducted across the University thus far, HUIT has received two reports of “unauthorized access,” according to Bailey. He wrote that the “enhanced security features” HUIT will activate Wednesday are intended to increase the privacy and security of Zoom meetings and classes.
“As the University has transitioned to virtual learning, privacy and security remain of the utmost importance to HUIT,” Bailey wrote. “We have, and will continue to, work with Zoom to address any concerns regarding this critical tool for remote teaching and learning.”
“We are pleased with Zoom’s response so far, including quickly fixing reported vulnerabilities,” he added.
Though Harvard affiliates use the application through a University subscription, Zoom announced that, as of Saturday, the same security measures Harvard is implementing have been made standard for individual users on free accounts.
The company has faced scrutiny for a number of other security issues in recent weeks. Vice News first reported on March 26 that Zoom was sharing some user data with Facebook, a practice the company said it ended the next day. The company also removed a feature that allowed meeting hosts to track the attention of attendees and admitted it had incorrectly suggested in the past that its app used end-to-end encryption.
Zoom Founder and CEO Eric S. Yuan wrote in an April 1 blog post that he was “deeply sorry” for the security lapses, adding that an influx of users amid the pandemic had allowed the company to uncover “unforeseen issues.” He outlined a number of steps the company was taking to improve cybersecurity.
“We did not design the product with the foresight that, in a matter of weeks, every person in the world would suddenly be working, studying, and socializing from home,” Yuan wrote. “We now have a much broader set of users who are utilizing our product in a myriad of unexpected ways, presenting us with challenges we did not anticipate when the platform was conceived.”
“We recognize that we have fallen short of the community’s – and our own – privacy and security expectations,” Yuan added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard transitions to remote instruction due to the coronavirus crisis, graduate students across the University’s 12 schools have advocated for tuition reimbursements to compensate for the in-person components of their education they can no longer access.
Harvard announced the University would switch to online classes and told affiliates to vacate campus Mar. 10 to help mitigate the COVID-19 outbreak. While Harvard decided to prorate room and board costs for all students leaving campus, it will not offer refund tuition as long as online instruction continues throughout the semester, according to the University’s website.
Still, many Harvard graduate students say they continue to have concerns about tuition reimbursements. Harvard Graduate Council president and School of Public Health student Bryan O. Buckley said students frequently raised tuition concerns on a Google sheet run by the newly-formed student group Students vs. Pandemics, and that student government presidents at the graduate schools said tuition reimbursement was on “top line” for many of their constituents.
Buckley — who said he has met with University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76’s office to discuss this issue — cited changes in quality of education, future economic insecurity in light of the pandemic, and inability to cultivate a professional network on campus as reasons why students are pushing for reimbursements.
“People are still going to get their degrees one way or another,” Buckley said. “But I also think one of the rich parts about being at Harvard [...] is also the social capital that you're able to make while here at Harvard. The connections that you're able to make, the people that you're able to see, a lot of the programming that you're able to attend.”
Law School student government co-presidents Princess Daisy M.A. Akita ’15 and Daniel M. Egel-Weiss also said they believe there are “a lot of opportunities that are lost” for Law School students when they are not physically on campus. Egel-Weiss cited the Law School’s lunch talk series, as well as access to the gym and free Wi-Fi.
“We're not looking for a full refund,” Egel-Weiss said. “We were just looking for compensation for those items that we no longer have access to.”
Akita also said students understand the process of reimbursement would be complicated by the fact that Law School students only pay one tuition bill that includes all services.
“It's really hard to delineate which pools of funds go to which specific provision that the Law School provides to students,” she said. “With this lack of clarity, it's really hard to know whether we should be advocating for ‘X percent of tuition’ based on the rollback of some of the things that students are accustomed to receiving from the institution.”
On the other hand, Harvard Medical School and Harvard School of Dental Medicine Student Council President LaShyra T. Nolen said students at the Medical School have overall been “very satisfied” with the response of the HMS administration.
“Even though the quality of our education might be impacted by the fact that we aren't able to be physically present to do lab projects and to work with PIs, I think that our professors have been readily available to answer any questions and to engage with us and to make sure that our quality of education hasn't been detrimentally impacted by these major changes,” Nolen said.
Harvard Kennedy School student government president Charlene A. Wang said Kennedy School students are interested in tuition reimbursements to help alleviate travel expenses students who are taking care of elderly parents incur, rent prices for students who cannot transfer their leasing agreements, and economic pressures on international students.
“Since we have a significant international student population, there are students who are coming from countries where their currencies are devaluing, so it's also important for them to get some sort of reduction in tuition this year,” Wang said. “It sounds like for students that even just $1,000 or something would make a big difference.”
In addition to tuition reimbursements, Law School and Kennedy School students are also concerned about extending University health insurance coverage for graduating students past July 31. Since states such as New York and Massachusetts have postponed the bar exam due to the coronavirus pandemic, Akita and Egel-Weiss said graduating law students may not be able to work after leaving Harvard, potentially leaving them without health insurance coverage.
“If the health insurance is ending on the 31st of July, then if they don't have a job until much later in the fall, then they're not covered insurance-wise,” Akita said. “In a pandemic, that is really alarming.”
Egel-Weiss added that the possibility of post-graduation job insecurity also prompted students’ push for tuition reimbursements.
“While we understand that there are larger issues in society right now than these refunds, those issues may impact students economically,” Egel-Weiss said. “We want to make sure that we're looking out for our students for a whole new world, in light of the pandemic.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Administrators at the Dean of Students Office say they will digitize rather than discard much of their operations as Harvard transitions online due to the coronavirus.
With University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s March 10 mandate that students vacate on-campus housing, Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair and her office lost the ability to extend normal services to students in person, including housing lotteries, inclusion and belonging projects, and freshmen support efforts.
Despite the departure of students on campus, O’Dair said in a Thursday interview that her office’s priorities and mission will remain largely unchanged.
“Our role is still to support students, even though the majority of students are not here,” O’Dair said.
O’Dair said the DSO is continuing to provide remote academic and advising support, and that major departments under her supervision — such as Harvard College’s Title IX office — are “fully up and running.”
“Our residential staff, in particular resident deans and academic coordinators, are still working every day to support the academic progress of our students to support their personal situations, whatever they may be,” she said.
Associate Dean of Student Engagement Alexander R. Miller said Thursday that the divisions he oversees — the Office of Student Engagement and the Office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion — have had to be “nimble” in addressing remote student interactions.
“Our student engagement units are thinking about virtual engagement, and what that looks like,” he said. “We're being thoughtful about how we can deliver that work remotely.”
Miller — who also serves as the acting dean of inclusion and belonging until Alta Mauro takes over the role May 1 — added that the EDI Office has adapted to supporting students remotely, including by holding virtual office hours.
“While we are on campus, we see the students in front of us,” Miller said. “We've had to be thoughtful about how we can provide the same level of programming and support, but only in a virtual environment. Our staff are thinking about the impact of this new virtual environment and how that will impact belonging and inclusion.”
Associate Dean of Students Lauren E. Brandt ’01 said the DSO also continues to support faculty and resident deans, tutors, and proctors as they work to maintain the essence of the Harvard residential system from afar.
“Many of the proctors are doing virtual study breaks with their entryways. The PAFs are involved as well,” Brandt said. “The tutors and the houses are finding new and different ways to reach out to their students as well. While it is a different way of interacting with students, it’s still very much a sense of what the Harvard residential system does.”
In the absence of students, Houses have largely transitioned to virtual platforms like Zoom to sustain House life and provide students with a connection to their peers, tutors, and faculty deans.
Despite its unchanged priorities, O’Dair acknowledged that circumstances require the DSO to adapt in order to support students as the semester wears on.
“This is such a huge disruption for everyone,” she said. “It's almost like every day we have to think about how we do things differently given this new reality, and that's really what we're focusing on.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of Harvard College Rakesh Khurana said in a Tuesday interview that he sees the transition to online learning as an opportunity for students and faculty to innovate in pedagogy and practice adaptability.
After Harvard mandated that students leave campus and finish their semester remotely to prevent the spread of coronavirus, faculty said they were concerned about logistical issues and learning quality in online classes.
Khurana said, however, that faculty members had, overall, reported increased levels of participation among their students by the third week of online classes.
He added that Zoom, a teleconference platform used for most classes, offers a number of advantageous features that promote engagement in the virtual classroom, including an in-meeting chat and “breakout” rooms.
“The chat side allows faculty to see questions that are emerging among students that might not otherwise get vocalized during the class and allows the faculty to understand the areas that might need clarification,” he said.
He added that the breakout rooms, which allow an instructor to send smaller groups of students into their own digital “rooms,” permit immediate and intimate discussion, which might have otherwise been difficult to organize in some in-person classes.
Khurana said he has been especially proud of the “learning orientation” of faculty, staff, and students as they have adapted to using Zoom.
“It is also teaching us that we can adapt, that we're capable of learning new things, that our fears, often, about doing something new are not always well-founded,” he said.
He also said students have embodied the College’s mission of fostering resilience throughout the move to online learning. He noted that resilience is a character trait the admissions office seeks in applicants.
“Leadership, ultimately, is the ability to be comfortable with being uncomfortable,” he explained. “It's the willingness to adapt and change to circumstance, but be steady in your values.”
Khurana also said he has admired the innovative ways students have forged digital connections with their now-distant peers, adding that his staff has also recently begun using the professional messaging service Slack.
“I'm seeing the reuse of things like Discord, and all sorts of other areas that I felt were made for video game chatting, are suddenly being used for creating a kind of hang-out community,” he said.
While Khurana said he believes it is “unfortunate” that the spread of coronavirus necessitated the College’s online transition, he also said he values the chance to reflect on new directions in pedagogy, as well as to celebrate the buoyancy of Harvard affiliates.
“If you would have told people a few weeks ago that we're going to run an entire experiment in which we're all going to change the way we learn and the way we work, my sense is that this is not an experiment most people would have been willing to run,” he said.
“But what it makes us realize is that on the other side of this is resilience and adaptability,” he added.

We all know that Zoom has changed the game when it comes to lectures. It feels all too ~optional~ to do our work, and now we don’t have letter grades. Either way, keep reading for the ultimate rundown of all the types of people we’ve all been seeing in our Zoom lectures.
The One Actually Doing Work
This person is easy to spot. They always have their camera and audio on, look nice regardless of the time zone, and actually participate in class. You always see them writing or taking notes, and they’re definitely carrying the class on participation. Maybe they’ve lost all sense of self without school and have decided to throw themselves into their work, or maybe they just have nothing better to do — who knows?
The One With the Virtual Background
Their video feed is always on solely to show you their virtual location. Some people choose a spot on campus like a classroom or dhall as their background, while others are just on the moon or lost in the grass picture that Zoom inexplicably comes with.
The One Who May or May Not Be In Class
You haven’t seen this classmate since you left campus. With their video and sound always off, it’s impossible to tell if this person is sitting in front of their computer watching TikToks, or if they’ve left completely to make lunch.
The One Who’s Constantly Eating
Speaking of lunch, this is your classmate who is never without a quarantine snack. Whether it’s a full meal, cereal, or just a pack of Oreos, they’re always making the rest of us jealous of their seemingly unending supply of tasty treats.
The One Who Doesn’t Even Go Here
There’ve been more and more problems with people crashing Zoom lectures, both to just awkwardly and silently creep and to be “funny” and disruptive. To them we say: get out, please just leave us in peace. We’re all already doing the best we can here, and you guys aren’t making it any easier.
There’s no question that spotting lecture personalities is 100% easier on Zoom – gallery view, anyone? – and the funny things that people do in class definitely have changed now that almost everyone’s off-campus. Hopefully, it keeps classes engaging if you need something else to pay attention to during lecture. Happy Zooming!

Too often, we don’t realize a good thing until it’s gone. Despite that one stretch in February where it feels like school will never end, our time at Harvard is limited. The days spent running from clubs to classes feel long, and the nights spent working on pset after pset feel even longer. But all those times we finally got meals with our incredible classmates, discovered secret study spots halfway through reading period, and squeezed into tiny dorm rooms for some classic claustrophobic hang outs prove that these are the moments that we will remember when we look back on these four years. As we all adjust to being away from campus, here are some ways you can bring a little bit of Harvard life home.
Set Boundaries with Your Roommates
If college has taught us anything, it’s how to live with other people. Your hyper little brother or strict parents might seem like heaven after months with your suitemate who refused to throw out their trash. It’s important to decide for yourself when the best times for you to hang out with the people you’re quarantined with are, as well as the best ways to help keep each other sane through all this isolation. Maybe your nightly routine involves staying up until 3 a.m. psetting and winding down with your throwback playlist, in which case saying goodnight to your parents and shutting yourself in your room is definitely the move. But playing card games after dinner or setting mock-J.P. Licks as the official Friday night dessert can help you feel like you’re keeping your traditions alive. Still, don’t forget to maintain your boundaries. If you find yourself needing advice on how to reply to your Bumble match, this is your reminder that your parents are not the right people to ask for help.
(Red) Spice It up With Some HUDS Classics
To truly recreate the full experience of Harvard dining, text three of your friends to see if they’re free to “grab a meal,” reschedule twice, and then FaceTime each other while you eat and complain about how long your reading is. Not every dhall meal is a win, but there are definitely some classic HUDS dishes we’re starting to miss. Whether your go-to is the three cheese grilled cheese, salmon in whatever sauce HUDS was feeling at the moment, or some iconic red spiced chicken, set aside an evening to recreate it for dinner at home.
Stick to a Schedule
You probably don’t want to hear this, but attending your lectures and sections is a great way to preserve the academic aspect of college. Spend some time each day doing your psets or grinding out that essay — when you’re lost in an especially scintillating chapter of Kant, you won’t even notice that you’re in your room with the blinds drawn instead of in your usual Lamont nook. Block out time for the things you would normally do, whether that’s working out in the mornings, calling friends or relatives, or indulging in a little self-care (face masks, anyone?). There’s nothing more satisfying than a perfectly color-coded bullet journal, or, in true Harvard fashion, a Gcal planned down to the minute.
Maintain a Social Life
Whether you’ve had a semester and a half or years to bond with your Harvard peers, it’s crazy how quickly these people can start to feel like family. They may not live next door anymore, but setting up weekly Zoom calls or tagging them whenever you come across good memes are great ways of ensuring that you guys can pick up right where you left off when you reunite. For the freshmen out there, it’ll also be good practice for keeping in touch with your friends who get quadded. We may not be Harvard State, but Saturday nights are still a thing. Slip your beverage of choice into your virtual shopping cart and schedule a time to Netflix party that Love is Blind or Cheer episode your blockmates have been meaning to catch up on since winter break.
If you follow these tips, you can transform wherever you are into your own little Harvard — just without the bells waking you up from your midday naps. Maybe the silver lining of this time spent away from the people and place we’ve come to love is that we’ll appreciate the time we do spend at Harvard that much more.
