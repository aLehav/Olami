After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hillary Clinton feels like a promise. She’s the missing page in a textbook filled with dead white men—the closest thing to living proof that girls can win at politics, too. She’s what many young women have been waiting for. So why don’t we like her?
Clinton’s national lead over Bernie Sanders narrows every day, and while Clinton has stayed on top with the female demographic overall, Sanders has edged her out as frontrunner when it comes to millennials: Recent polls have Sanders ahead among Democratic and independent women aged 18 to 34 by as many as 19 points.
This deficit isn’t new. Warning bells rang as far back as September, when the early summer’s sunny numbers gave way to a bleaker fall forecast for Clinton. Then as now, while older women stood strong with Clinton, younger ones were slipping off to Sanders’s camp. A few things might explain the gap.
On the simplest level, Clinton seems out of touch and unrelatable. Some women say they don’t see Clinton as their grandmother. Others can’t see her as a sister. That’s understandable. Efforts at hipness from Clinton can ring as hollow as Mitt Romney standing next to a group of black people and blurting, “Who let the dogs out?” before woofing twice. It’s a problem a gig on Saturday Night Live and a few stump speeches from Lena Dunham can’t fix. But there’s more to Clinton’s crisis than stiffness or an age gap.
Clinton’s femaleness seems to have backfired. Instead of drawing young women closer to her, it’s pushing them further and further away. It doesn’t matter that Clinton is a woman. It matters that she’s not our kind of woman. Millennial female voters never expected to see themselves in Sanders. Not seeing ourselves in Clinton, or Clinton in us, is so jarring precisely because we think we should.
These past weeks, it’s been easier than ever to feel jarred. No longer is it only recent missteps, like a private email server, that dog Clinton. Now, decades-old indiscretions have come back to haunt her as well: The scandals of the 1990s, when Bill Clinton’s campaign for a second term came under threat amid multiple allegations of sexual harassment, have started to loom large over his wife’s own run.
“Bimbo eruptions,” Clinton aide Betsey Wright famously said in response to the claims. “Floozy,” Bill Clinton called one of the women who spoke out. “We have to destroy her story,” Hillary Clinton announced of a second. Fearful that Republicans were preparing to turn the tide against the then-president, the Clintons formed a united front.
For many younger women, Clinton’s choices in the ’90s doom her in 2016. Certainly, the discrediting crusade she helped wage against her husband’s accusers wouldn’t fly in today’s political climate. But for older women, it has proven easier to write Clinton’s decision off as a product of the past—just as it has proven easier for them to forgive Clinton for holding more conservative positions in more conservative climates.
Different circumstances call for different decisions. Those who have lived long enough to witness society’s shifts are more likely to comprehend how someone could make a decision in one era that she wouldn’t make in another. It’s tough for younger women, who only know today’s standards, to relate.
Perhaps older women have also discovered that sometimes life calls for, well, hard choices. Sometimes, no option falls in sync with the people we think we are, or the people we want to be. It’s difficult always to make the right call over the course of three decades—especially when, as in Clinton’s case, every personal decision turns political and public. This is a problem younger women haven’t yet had to confront and a problem they may have more trouble understanding.
Thinking that way, it’s fair to weigh more heavily what Clinton says and does now than what she said and did in the ’90s. Because presidential candidates tend to do in the Oval Office what they vowed to do on the campaign trail, that’s not a bad tack to take.
The notion of girl power shouldn’t be enough to keep every female Democrat worshipping at the altar of Hillary. But past and personal slip-ups that don’t jibe with our current conception of sisterhood shouldn’t be enough to keep us away, either—at least for those of us who find the candidate’s policy positions up to snuff.
As far as those positions go, Clinton has a strong record on women’s rights, from equal pay to emergency contraception, and has campaigned for change in the same direction. And even aside from the feminist front, the country needs a progressive pragmatist in the White House—not a mythmaker with a pipe dream for a platform. With the policy smarts to think up solutions and the political skill to push them through, Clinton is the best person for the job.
Hillary Clinton is not our sister. She’s a politician. If we get behind her, she could be a president.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the recent release of the General Education Review Committee’s final report, a redesigned Gen Ed program seems inevitable. The new Gen Ed program should present the best teaching that Harvard has to offer while attracting students to courses both inside and outside their disciplines. While we still have concerns about the proposed structure of the new set of requirements, we are glad that the report directly addresses the need for improving the quality of teaching in Gen Ed courses.
For example, the report stresses the importance of pedagogy, proposing “high-visibility incentives” for professors and the creation of a professorship "explicitly designed to award faculty teaching well in the Gen Ed Program.” These ideas will guarantee that no professor approaches Gen Ed teaching as a trivial afterthought.
In the same vein, increasing the resources given to the Gen Ed program is a positive development. Teaching fellows with more training, smaller section sizes, and incentives to teach well in the Gen Ed program will lead to better learning for undergraduates. These laudable initiatives from the review committee underline its understanding of the sources of discontent with the current system and its determination to alleviate them.
Nevertheless, even the new system continues to pose issues for teaching quality. If, for example, Gen Ed classes are to remain at roughly the same size, departments in the natural sciences and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences which currently provide fewer Gen Ed courses will need to create more.
Throughout discussions of improving the quality of teaching within the Gen Ed program, a sometimes overlooked issue is the current model of graduate student teaching. A case in point is Professor Shaye J.D. Cohen’s course on the Hebrew Bible, notorious for being an easy way to satisfy the Culture and Belief General Education requirement. Cohen himself acknowledged as much this week when he said that “rigorous demands” for coursework would deter students from enrolling. For Cohen, ensuring a large enrollment in his courses is important because without large Gen Ed courses, his graduate students “would all go hungry” for lack of teaching positions.
In the last section of its January final report, the General Education Review Committee pointed to this exact issue, observing that “the current graduate teaching model motivates some faculty to maximize course enrollment… as a way to support their Department’s graduate programs.” Recognizing this flaw is a crucial first step to improving the pedagogy of the Gen Ed problem.
Indeed, undergraduate teaching is directly affected by funding concerns for graduate students. Students in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences are generally expected to teach during their third and fourth years of study as part of their funding packages. In departments like history, however, fourth year graduate students are expected to be off campus conducting research. Were the report to fully address these administrative differences as well as the issues with how graduate students are employed, it would give us more confidence that the revamped Gen Ed program will result in a higher quality of teaching.
Since the report calls for the creation of classes outside of existing academic departments, cooperation between the departments and the Gen Ed program is crucial. Harvard must ensure that Professors and TFs have the resources to put pedagogy first. We hope that the review committee’s report will give impetus to this change.

I have acquired the habit of inspecting my walls whenever I enter my room. It is a flippant rejoinder to the recent “revelation” that Winthrop House contains asbestos. In truth, I cannot call the announcement newsworthy; anyone who has lived in Winthrop can attest to its structural dilapidation. Still, I partake in the waggish social rituals that the news has generated. I offer my condolences and prayers to friends; I half-jokingly talk with fellow residents about our earnings from the inevitable class-action lawsuit—but only half-jokingly because, while the presence of asbestos was expected, it is nonetheless worrisome. I think about the students and staff who have been affected. I think about the administrative response, which assured us that no one has been “exposed to inappropriate or dangerous levels of asbestos.” Notwithstanding its unsettling resemblance to the prologue of "Contagion," the response felt dismissive and forced. Given that students have criticized the state of Winthrop for years, it is clear that the powers who handle University funding are unlikely to listen to complaints of structural feculence (unless, of course, it affects the bottom line). Met with this silence, I continue to write down Mesothelioma hotline numbers. I think about buying a facemask.
And then I remember. I remember that there are places in this country where facemasks have no power. Places where structural violence is met with tepid anger and bottled water. Seven hundred miles west, the city of Flint cannot be bothered with witty rhetoric and self-indulgent routines. Residents there are being sacrificed in the pursuit of balanced budgets. To save money in the face of declining tax revenues, government officials turned to historical precedent: They poisoned poor people. Water management reorganizations coupled with the looming termination of a municipal water service contract led to the unilateral decision to use the Flint River (a highly polluted waterway) as an interim water source, carrying the water through decrepit pipes. And so, since 2014, Flint residents have been forced to pay for odorous, discolored water. Water so corrosive, General Motors refused to use the water for its car parts; water so dangerous, municipal officials were promised water coolers in every office. Even without the revelation of lead contamination, any resident in Flint could have talked about how unsafe the water was.
But lead was found. And lead poisoning, even in small quantities, is debilitating. Moreover, these harmful effects are disproportionately borne on children—undue exposure to lead almost invariably results in health complications, learning disabilities, social impairment, and decreased motor skills. Just one child being forced to drink lead-contaminated water is unforgivable. Michigan poisoned an entire generation. Yet, as I search for resignations, prison sentences, and uprisings, I encounter a sobering truth: Apologies, apparently, are sufficient penance for these children.
Lead poisoning is largely irreversible. It does not forgive. So why should we? Why are we content with letting criminals roam free? Why are we content with anything short of a complete infrastructural overhaul, paid for by those responsible? Why are we silent?
We say nothing, because we know the implications. We know that Flint is not the only city that is faced with contaminated drinking water. At least thirteen cities across the state have reported dangerously high levels of lead. Like Flint, many of these cities are communities of color, cities with aging infrastructures, economically disenfranchised residents, and declining tax bases. We cannot calculate the number of children affected by chipping paint and corroding water pipes, but we know the number is indefensible. And if we acknowledge the cities in Michigan, won’t we then have to turn to Chicago? And Baltimore?
I write this piece, and I wonder, when will justice come for these children? Will it come from op-eds? Will it come from bottled water? I ask these questions, and I cry. Surely, the poisoning of children (even those who are black, brown, or poor) can inspire moral outrage. But I have seen Michigan’s response countless times: Assurances, increased oversight, promises—these are the peaceful solutions promised by our government.
But we will never find justice in these methods, for justice is not peaceful. Justice is retributive. Justice is redemptive. So we must redeem these lives with brimstone. Will we make the transgressors drink lead? Will we poison their children? We are certainly not above such tactics in the pursuit of lesser goals, like budget surpluses.
I think these things, and still I cry. Because the crisis in Flint is a confirmation of a basic, American reality: Certain lives do not matter. This reality predominately affects black and brown children, but white children too—a reality in which we are all complicit. I see individuals up in arms over the re-sentencing of an arsonist, but who will not spare a bullet for those suffering from actual brutality at the hands of government. I see myself writing this piece, privileged enough to toy with the possibility of taking legal action against the most affluent educational institution in the world, when the law has abandoned these children. Where has our conscience gone? Are we too depraved to tear down a government that has killed the innocent?
The truth is, we have already tuned out their screams.
So I sit here silently, looking at the cracks in my walls.

Economics 10b: “Principles of Economics” is once again the largest course in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, marking the third consecutive year it has achieved that distinction, according to data from the registrar's office.
With an enrollment totaling 558 students as of Sunday afternoon, the flagship introductory economics course remains a popular choice for undergraduates. Economics 10a: “Principles of Economics” drew 700 students last fall, even with competition from courses like Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I.”
“I’m delighted when we have high enrollment numbers in Ec 10,” N. Gregory Mankiw, Economics professor and the course head, said. “Students understand that knowing a little bit of economics is an important basis for being a well-informed citizen.”
Government 1359: “The Road to the White House” was another popular choice this term, drawing in 467 students, up from 299 the last time it was offered. The course, offered only in presidential election years, is more than just an exercise in current events, according to course instructor and Government lecturer Carlos E. Diaz Rosillo.
“It’s not just a class about the current campaign,” Diaz Rosillo said. “It’s a serious, rigorous class about how the political science theory applies to an actual campaign.”
Diaz Rosillo attributes some of the course’s popularity to students’ curiosity about politics, especially in an election year in which there are contested nomination battles in both the Republican and Democratic parties.
“There are a lot of people who are eager to learn about what’s going on,” Diaz Rosillo said. “My goal is to expose students to cutting edge scholarship on presidential campaigns.”
The introductory biology class Life Sciences 1b: “An Integrated Introduction to the Life Sciences: Genetics, Genomics, and Evolution” also remained popular this spring with enrollment totaling 398 students.
“As an instructor, I’m thrilled to see that there’s that much interest in biology and in particular genetics,” said Pardis C. Sabeti, one of the course heads and an associate professor of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology. “I do very much believe that genetics is one of those technologies that’s truly transforming and will field major breakthroughs in the years ahead.”
Rounding out the list of the semester’s most popular courses were Psychology 15: “Social Psychology” and Societies of the World 38: “Pyramid Schemes: The Archaeological History of Ancient Egypt,” a general education course.
“Obviously I’m delighted,”  said Fiery A. Cushman, an associate professor and course head for Psychology 15, about the course’s popularity. “The whole point of teaching the class is that I think it’s interesting material and helpful, so I’m thrilled that more people will get exposure to it.”
Societies of the World 38, the only general education course ranking among the top five most popular courses this term, grew to 344 students from 77 last spring.
“The accessibility and the excitement of Ancient Egypt has a broad appeal, and I think the word is getting out,” Peter Der Manuelian, Societies of the World 38’s professor, said, referring to his course. “I view this as a gateway course... for those who want to stop in on the land of the pharaohs.”

A group of Harvard professors and students from across the University has begun meeting to review Harvard’s Title IX policies and potentially recommend changes.
The committee— led by former interim Dean of the College and current professor Donald H. Pfister— has thus far studied Harvard’s existing approach to sexual misconduct on campus, Pfister said. Although the committee has no mandated goal or report, according to Pfister, it will recommend policy recommendations when necessary. The committee meets once a month, Pfister said.
“We’re not charged a specific end point, but rather to be a kind of ongoing group that is monitoring and thinking about these issues,” he said. “If we find a place where policies need to be modified, we would come up with suggestions about it.”
The committee begins its work as Harvard’s Title IX policies and procedures, overhauled in July 2014, continue to be the subject of scrutiny. Professors at Harvard Law School have publicly and privately criticized the University’s approach to the issue, charging in an open letter in the Boston Globe that the Harvard's process for investigating sexual harassment is stacked against the accused. After prolonged pushback, the school eventually adopted a separate set of procedures that broke from the Harvard's centralized model. The federal government, meanwhile, continues to investigate Harvard College’s compliance with anti-sex discrimination law Title IX.
Beyond debates about policy, sexual assault became a central focus on campus last semester, after administrators released the results of Harvard's sexual conduct climate survey. The survey found that 31 percent of senior undergraduate female respondents at the College reported they had experienced some kind of sexual assault during their time at the College. In the aftermath, University President Drew G. Faust called the results “deeply disturbing” and said Harvard’s response to the issue was “completely insufficient.”
Pfister said that the committee is reviewing data from the survey and cases that have gone through the Office for Sexual and Gender-Based Dispute Resolution, the centralized office that leads investigations into sexual misconduct at every Harvard school except the Law School.
The members of the committee come from almost every Harvard school. In addition to Pfister, the committee includes: Jean M.  Cunningham, an associate dean at the Business School; Christine A. Desan, a Law professor who signed the letter in the Globe; David E. Golan ’75, the dean of graduate education at the Medical School; Sonia Hernández-Díaz, a professor at the School of Public Health; Mark D. Jordan, a professor at the Divinity School; Pamela A. Mason, a lecturer at the Graduate School of Education; Margaret E. Newell, deputy provost; Felix Oberholzer-Gee, a Business School professor; Julia M. Rogers, a graduate student; Tommie Shelby, an African and African American Studies professor; Blair Storie Johnson, a graduate student; Sarah E. Wald, the dean’s chief of staff at the Kennedy School and a lecturer there; and Langston Ward ’17.

Partying in Cabot House just got easier.
The introduction of a streamlined “Fast Track” party registration pilot program at the start of the semester means Cabot undergraduates can now register parties on shorter notice and with laxer requirements, expediting the process for registering in-House social events.
In the past, registering a social gathering in Cabot for more than 15 people required multiple physical signatures submitted at least 24 hours in advance. The new system allows Cabot juniors and seniors to fill out a brief Google form any time before the party begins, and requires no staff involvement apart from notifying a designated tutor on call for parties of up to 50 students. Parties exceeding that size are subject to the normal registration process, Cabot House Dean Tiffanie L. Ting wrote in an email  announcing the new guidelines. 
Ordinarily, students hoping to register parties must fill out extensive forms provided on a House-by-House basis. The standard forms prohibit students under 21 years old from hosting events with alcohol, and requires the signatures of all members of the suite in which a party will be hosted.
Cabot’s pilot, a break from the normal model, does not require students to fill out information regarding age and alcohol consumption—it only asks them to affirm their commitment to responsible drinking. Nor does the new form require signatures.
All suite members must attend a workshop on responsible party-hosting before being added to Cabot's "fast track" party registration list.
Administrators have recently attempted to re-focus undergraduate social life in the Houses. Last semester, Cabot House renovated its Junior Common Room—recently named the “aquarium”—as a hub for House and College-wide social events. Staff in Adams House also created a similar room that students may reserve for private events.
The rollout of Cabot’s new party registration program comes as Rakesh Khurana, Dean of the College and co-Master of Cabot House, criticizes final clubs and students critique the lack of social spaces available on campus.
University President Drew G. Faust has also spoken out against final clubs and committed resources to strengthening social life on campus. During an interview in October, Faust said she had donated a lump sum to the College to fund undergraduate social events, including October’s “[BLANK] party,” a College-wide event hosted by undergraduate women groups.
Cabot’s new policy is similar to the Mather House party registration process, called the “Fast Pass,” which is intended to decrease the time between registering a party with House administrators and the time of the event.
Trevor A. Mullin ’17, co-chair of Mather’s House committee, said students can register parties in Mather any time during the day of the event when using the “Fast Pass” system. At least half of the host room’s residents must attend a preliminary two-hour training session run by the Drug and Alcohol Peer Advisors and Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response at the beginning of each year. House staff approval is not required to register Fast Pass parties in Mather.
Neither the Undergraduate Council nor Cabot HoCo were responsible for the initiative, according to Undergraduate Council President Shaiba Rather ’17 and Cabot House Committee Chair Rebecca J. Ramos ’17.
Ting did not respond to a request for comment.

For the first time since the 2012 fiscal year, Harvard’s endowment grew at a faster rate than the national average for American colleges and universities last fiscal year, according to a National Association of College and University Business Officers and Commonfund Institute report released last week.
Harvard’s endowment, managed by the Harvard Management Company, grew by 5.8 percent in the last fiscal year, exceeding the NACUBO national average of 2.4 percent for private colleges and universities. The endowment, which rose to $37.6 billion in the 2015 fiscal year, also outpaced the average growth rate of endowments valued over $1 billion—4.3 percent.
While Harvard beat national averages this year, it still lagged behind several peer institutions in return on investment. Yale and Princeton, for example, grew at rates of 11.5 percent and 12.7 percent respectively, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology boasted returns of 13.2 percent. Last October, University President Drew G. Faust said she is concerned about the endowment’s lackluster returns.
FY 2015, which ended June 30, 2015, was a year of transition for HMC. Stephen Blyth started at the helm of Harvard's investment arm in January 2015, and he has begun making changes to HMC’s structure and compensation methods. Several staff departures have also followed during Blyth’s tenure.
In HMC’s 2015 FY report, Blyth urged investors to take a longer-term view of the endowment returns.
“Like many, I believe that the annual ‘horse race’ between endowment returns is counterproductive to fostering the appropriate long-term investment strategies suitable for Harvard,” he wrote, suggesting that the endowment’s performance should be viewed in a “rolling five-year window.”
Harvard’s endowment has not yet recovered from the $11 billion loss it suffered during the 2008 financial crisis, according to the 2015 FY report. While its nominal value is higher than ever before, when adjusted for inflation, Harvard’s endowment remains smaller than its peak in 2008.

Janet L. Yellen, Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, will receive the Radcliffe Medal in May in recognition of her work in guiding the nation’s economy.
The Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study gives the award each year to an “honoree whose life and work have made a significant impact on our society,” according to the Radcliffe Institute’s press release.
“As Chair of the Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen is skillfully charting the nation's course in unpredictable and sometimes rough economic seas,” wrote Lizabeth Cohen, dean of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, in an emailed statement.  “The Radcliffe Medal honors her for extraordinary leadership and her commitment—as our morning panel will explore—building an economy for prosperity and equality.”
Yellen, the first female chair of the Federal Reserve, will receive the medal on May 27, Radcliffe Day. The annual celebration honors the Institute’s mission and commitment to “excellence and inquiry,” according to the Radcliffe Day website.
During a luncheon, Yellen will discuss her work at the Federal Reserve, along with Ben S. Bernanke ’75, former Chair of the Federal Reserve, and Economics professor N. Gregory Mankiw.
The event will begin with a panel, titled “Building an Economy for Prosperity and Equality,” which features four economic and public policy experts. Cecilia E. Rouse ’86,  an economics professor and Dean of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University, will moderate the panel.
“The conversation is not exclusively a tribute to the honoree —rather it is intended to illuminate the complex [worlds] in which our honorees navigate and make progress,” wrote Radcliffe spokesperson Alison Franklin, in an emailed statement.
U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg served as last year’s honoree.  Other past medalists include Harvard President Drew G. Faust, former tennis professional Billie Jean King, and actress and arts advocate Jane Alexander.

As Iowans head to caucus Monday for the first primary of the election cycle, some Harvard College Republicans are apprehensive about the prospect of Republican front-runner and businessman Donald J. Trump leading their party.
Should Trump win the Republican nomination, the Harvard Republican Club is unsure whether they would endorse him, according to Gwen R. Thomas ’17, HRC president.
As of Sunday evening, the latest Iowa poll from the Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics put Trump five points ahead of his nearest competitor in the Republican field, Ted Cruz. Nationally, Trump’s lead is arguably stronger, with a recent Bloomberg poll indicating that Trump leads the Republicans with 34 percent support compared to second place finisher Marco Rubio’s 14 percent.
Trump’s divisive campaign poses a difficult challenge for Republicans struggling to find a voice on Harvard’s undoubtedly liberal campus. As the Harvard Republican Club tries to appeal to a diverse group of students who adhere to an array of conservative ideologies, Trump’s rhetoric alienates other conservatives, some say.
“Generally, the Republicans and conservatives at Harvard understand that if we truly want to appeal to the next generation, we can’t be an angry, anti-immigrant, anti-religious freedom movement,” said Kent K. Haeffner ’18, treasurer of the HRC and campus leader for Harvard students for Jeb Bush.
Four  Harvard Republicans said Trump’s message, which they characterized as often racist and provocative, does not align with their mission.
Although the Harvard Republican Club does not typically endorse a candidate during the primaries, the organization conducted a straw poll at a general meeting in November. The informal poll indicated that 48 percent of the membership supported Marco Rubio, 48 percent Jeb Bush, and four percent percent Carly Fiorina, said Aaron I. Henricks ’16, former president of the HRC. The survey indicated no support for Trump.
Henricks, who claims to know most public conservatives on campus, doesn’t know of any Trump supporters at Harvard.
“I think I’ve heard rumors of one existing, maybe in the far reaches of the Quad, but I don’t think they’re serious,” Henricks said.
Other Harvard Republicans including Cameron K. Khansarinia  ’18, a vice president of the HRC, also denied knowing a single Harvard student for Trump.
As the National Co-chair of Students for Rubio, Khansarinia added that he is “disappointed” in his party’s support of Trump, arguing that his rhetoric is “divisive.”
“It’s simply not what the conservative movement or what our country stands for,” Khansarinia said.
Harvard Republicans' distrust of Trump poses a dilemma for the HRC, which Thomas said has “gone all in” to support the nominee of their party in the past. If Trump wins the nomination, the club will have to vote whether or not to campaign for him, Thomas said.
Although the HRC is hopeful that Trump’s pre-election polls won’t equate to actual votes on election day, apprehension remains that their own party will nominate Trump.
“The bubble was supposed to burst a long time ago on Trump,” Thomas said.

Harvard United for Bernie, the student group supporting Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, held a series of four phone banks last week in a push to contact potential voters in Iowa ahead of Monday’s caucus.
Formed by a group of Harvard undergraduates who attended a Sanders rally held in Boston last October, the group has coordinated weekly phone banks since then, according to president He Li ’16.
The group now counts more than 150 members on its email list and is gaining traction, Justin G. Curtis ’19, vice president of Harvard United for Bernie, said. He added the group has also canvassed in New Hampshire in preparation for the upcoming primary there. 
“We have a pretty active Harvard United for Bernie Facebook page,” Curtis said. “People are commenting and sending us messages, so we’re gaining traction.”
While the group itself has gained momentum, its members have said they have seen an increase in popular interest for the Vermont Senator who calls himself a “Democratic Socialist.”
“When we started calling into Iowa in October and November, people were receptive, but said they were just starting to look into the race, or that they were not thinking about it until January,” Li said. “People are paying a lot more attention now."
Li said he was pleased with the weekend's turnout of nearly 15 phone bankers who made nearly 2,000 calls by the end of the push.
Student callers from across the College  said they supported Sanders because of his focus on issues of social justice and the middle class.
Sarah A. Welsh ’19 said she was impressed by Sanders’ ability to speak to people who may not necessarily agree with his stances, and found her most meaningful conversations were those with less informed callers.
“For me, to share my knowledge about Senator Sanders and his policies is very meaningful,” Welsh said.
Phone-bankers were optimistic about Sanders’ chances in Monday’s caucuses.
“We feel really good about his chances in Iowa," Li said. “He has this incredible ground game going on in Iowa,” Li said.
Joe Caiazzo, director of communications and politics for the Sanders campaign in Massachusetts, commended the role of college and universities in the campaign and the impact of phone bankers on campus.
“I think the best way to campaign is through direct voter contact, which is through phone banks and through canvassing,” he said. “The biggest thing [college student groups] can do is encourage the student body to vote, to make an actual, conscious effort to make it easier for students to get to polling locations,” he said.
Harvard United for Bernie has also collaborated with other colleges in the Boston area to organize trips to New Hampshire to canvass in preparation for next week’s New Hampshire primary election, Li said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Clad in a Harvard beanie, worn jeans, and sneakers, Ron K. Unz ’83 did not look like someone seeking to become one of the University’s most esteemed alumni and powerbrokers.
On Sunday morning, Unz, equipped with a series of charts and graphs detailing the annals of Harvard budgeting and admissions data, stood for hours outside the Harvard Coop and the Science Center. He had arrived in Cambridge early that morning by way of Palo Alto with a singular purpose: to formally launch a campaign for Harvard’s Board of Overseers. 
Per Unz’s estimate, he had collected almost 300 signatures over a series of weeks—shipping petitions to alumni across the country—to earn a spot on the ballot for Harvard’s second highest governing body. He arrived in the Square to collect a few more signatures; each member of his ticket needs 201 of them by Monday to enter the race.
His tactics are unconventional, but Unz—who took a red-eye flight from Palo Alto—is an unusual candidate. An outspoken conservative, Unz, along with four other Harvard alumni including five-time presidential candidate Ralph Nader, launched a campaign earlier this month on a dual-pronged ticket. They want to abolish undergraduate tuition and make public more detailed data about Harvard’s admissions process.
While Unz won’t know if his efforts were fruitful until he turns in the petitions, he remains optimistic.
“You can never be sure,” Unz said. “But because we only need 201 valid signatures and we’re going to be turning in close to 300, I think we definitely have a very good chance of getting on the ballot.”
In their campaign materials, the prospective candidates argue that Harvard tuition should be free given the size of the University’s endowment—valued at $37.6 billion, the largest of any educational institution in the world. They say such a move would precipitate widespread publicity for Harvard and inspire students from lower income families to apply.
“If Harvard abolished tuition, I think you would have a much more regionally and socioeconomically diverse student body,” Unz said, standing at his post near the Coop.
The slate—which also includes physicist Stephen D. Hsu, conservative writer Stuart S. Taylor, Jr., and NewEgg’s Chief Legal Officer Lee C. Cheng ’93—also calls for greater transparency in undergraduate admissions. Together, they want more information about how the College chooses its students. They say they are suspicious that Harvard’s race-based affirmative action policies could, in effect, discriminate against Asian American students.
While University spokesperson Jeff Neal declined to comment for this story, he has previously defended both Harvard’s tuition and admissions practices. In particular, he has pointed to the generosity of Harvard’s existing financial aid program and the educational value of race-based affirmative action.
Still, Unz remains persistent. Skeptical of standard methods of shipping and mailing, he flew to Cambridge with what he said is more than 30 pounds worth of petitions to hand-deliver them to Harvard on Monday—the deadline to qualify for candidacy.
His group’s lofty ideas have drawn widespread media attention, but foot traffic is slow in the Square, Unz lamented.
Around 11 a.m., former bookbinder and Harvard Square regular Robert Marshall walked past, praising Unz’s campaign. Marshall, who claims he attended Harvard for a few semesters decades ago, said he supports Unz’s group.
“Listen: Harvard is Harvard. Harvard will never change. But we hope to make some changes,” Marshall said, taking one of Unz’s purple “Free Harvard, Fair Harvard” buttons.
“I want to wear one. I can put it over my city jacket,” Marshall said.
Harvard officials past and present have contested the feasibility of Unz’s goals. Unz himself admits that, even if elected, it is not likely he would be able to make tuition free. But for him, the campaign is just as important as its end goal.
“Sometimes an election campaign is more important than who actually sits on the Board of Overseers,” Unz said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A mobile calendar application that last year’s Undergraduate Council leaders lauded and funded— even as some representatives questioned its efficacy has powered down.
Ventfull, which had been available at Harvard for the past two semesters, recently shut down, according to Brown undergraduate Joseph Stein, a co-founder of the application.
“The effort we were putting into maintaining it and bringing in new customers was disproportionate for the amount of money we were making from it,” Stein said. 
The application, initially released in February 2014 by Stein and then-Brown undergraduate Peter Simpson, aggregates on-campus events and displays them in a calendar format. Former UC President Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16 and Vice President Dhruv P. Goyal ’16 introduced the application to Harvard in 2015. Frequently praising Ventfull during their presidential campaign, Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal said the program would mitigate the “fear of missing out” among college students.
As the UC continued to fund the calendar application throughout last year, many representatives criticized what they deemed a failing and underutilized program. Newly elected UC President Shaiba Rather ’17 and Vice President Daniel V. Banks ’17 updated the representatives on the future of Ventfull at the first Council-wide meeting of the semester.
“Our Ventfull partnership is off,” Rather said to applause from several UC representatives.
Ventfull’s termination followed unsuccessful negotiations between UC leaders and the application’s developers over Harvard's potential purchase of the program.The groups ultimately forwent any deal after they reached an impasse in gaining access to Ventfull’s code base, Goyal said.
“There were certain things that we wanted to do that the current code wouldn't let us do. Having access to that code would give us the flexibility to tailor Ventfull towards the needs of the Harvard campus,” Goyal said. “They were willing to sell the application, but we were not willing to buy it unless we had the ability to vet the code and study it.”
When Ventfull declined the UC's request to vet the code prior to purchase, the UC backed out of negotiations, Goyal said.
“The impasse in the negotiations is a matter of life, and we just had to deal with it,” Goyal said.
Since its launch last February, the application was met with mixed reviews from Council representatives, who initially voted to spend $1,200 for a one-semester trial period. The UC continued to fund Ventfull out of the Council’s operations budget last summer. More than 2,700 students had signed up for the application, Goyal said.
Most recently, the UC voted 26-14 in December to spend another $1,200 to fund Ventfull for a third semester.  That transaction will not take place, according to Goyal.
Last December, many UC representatives criticized the application, which they characterized as a failed program. An April report by the UC’s Student Relations Committee states that “while the idea of Ventfull was good in intention, there was general agreement that it was not being used by the campus.” The report recommended that the Council consider a “free alternative that is already widely used,” such as Google Calendar.
Some representatives who had voted against funding the application last semester praised the program’s termination.
“I’m very glad that it’s dead,” UC representative Oliver W. Kim ’16, an inactive Crimson editor, said. “It was a waste of students’ money, it was used by nobody, and it was a drain on the UC’s time and effort.”
An update to Omni, a separate Harvard application that aggregates student resources, removed Ventfull from its features last Tuesday. UC representatives will discuss potential alternatives to the calendar application in the coming weeks, Rather said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Board of Overseers plans to meet informally with undergraduate students ahead of the body’s next meeting, according to newly elected Undergraduate Council President Shaiba Rather ’17 and Vice President Daniel V. Banks ’17.
During the meetings, the Board of Overseers—Harvard's second highest governing body— will solicit feedback on student issues, Rather and Banks said at the Council’s first general meeting on Sunday. Banks, who along with Rather campaigned on a platform calling for Harvard to elect an undergraduate to the Board of Overseers, said the Council aims to have more interaction with the Overseers than in previous years.
The Council’s first meeting began with a statement from Dean of Freshmen and newly appointed Interim Office of Student Life Dean Thomas A. Dingman ’67, who praised the representatives’ efforts to work on projects related to freshmen.
“This year’s first year group has been extraordinary to work with,” Dingman said, citing freshman projects that included placing printers in more freshman dorms, enhancing brain break, adding game tables to several dorms, and installing a kitchen in Pennypacker.
“We’re always looking for ways to improve life at Harvard,” Dingman said.
The UC held its first meeting in the Leverett House Library Theater, a first for a body that typically meets in Harvard Hall or Sever Hall.
“This is part of a program of rotating UC Gens,” Rather said, referring to the Council’s weekly meetings. “UC Gens are open to the entire school–the entire school might not know that, or they might know that and not want to walk all the way to Harvard Hall. We want to lower that barrier to entry.”
To encourage more students to attend UC meetings, Rather and Banks plan to change the venue throughout the semester. They said they also plan to advertise the location and time of meetings.
The UC considered two pieces of legislation on Sunday. The first concerned rules about the authorization of spending, and a second focused on the purchase of a new projector for the Office of Student Life. Representatives ultimately tabled both pieces of legislation, pending votes at a future meeting.
The projector legislation spurred some backlash from UC members who debated the source of the funding for the equipment. Some representatives argued that the Council’s Student Initiatives Committee, rather than the UC’s operations budget, should fund the projector.
Rather and Banks named Daniel R. Levine ’17— an inactive Crimson editor the UC’s new Rules Committee Chair  and Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18 new Parliamentarian.
Rather said ten spots on the UC are open for election this semester. Special elections are tentatively set to begin on Feb. 9.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

The shades of last year’s Ivy League Championships haunted Harvard men’s swimming and diving team this weekend, as, for the second time in under a year, the Crimson came into a meet at DeNunzio Pool undefeated and left with a loss.
Despite decisively besting Yale (8-3, 4-3 Ivy League), 263-90, Harvard (9-1, 6-1) fell to Princeton (6-0, 6-0), 224.5-126.5, this Friday and Saturday in Princeton, N.J.
Although the Tigers managed to win the annual H-Y-P contest for the first time since 2012, the meet was marked by a number of encouraging performances from Crimson athletes as the team enters the championship portion of its season.
“Throughout the whole season we've been swimming faster at each dual meet than the last, so we're on a perfect trajectory heading into Ivy champs,” senior captain Jacob Luna said. “This was a great way to cap off the regular season because everyone is seeing their hard work paying off even though we're still broken down from tough training.”
Harvard’s strongest showing of the weekend came from its divers, who continued the team’s run of dominance on the boards.
Sophomore David Pfeiffer led the team once again, taking first overall in the three-meter event. Sophomore Bobby Ross was close behind in second, with freshman Luke Martinez’s third-place result rounding out a Crimson 1-2-3 sweep. Pfeiffer won the one-meter event as well, as Ross took third.
However, while Harvard commanded the diving portion of the meet, the swimming events were all about the Tigers, who finished the weekend with first place finishes in 14 of 19 events overall. The Crimson, meanwhile, placed a swimmer in podium position in all but six events, but managed to take top marks in just four.
Harvard nonetheless kicked off the meet with a strong showing in the 200 freestyle relay. The team of sophomore Steven Tan, junior Paul O’Hara, freshman Sebastian Lutz, and Junior Max Yakubovich took second  just .03 seconds behind the leader.
The Crimson’s run of promising results continued in the next few events, as sophomore Jack Boyd ended up third in the 200 free and classmate Koya Osada matched Boyd’s mark for a third-place finish in the 100 back.
Harvard would also go on to capture two of the top three spots in the 50 free, with Lutz earning second and Tan touching the wall close behind him to end up in third.
However, Princeton quickly began to find its footing. The Tigers captured 1-2-3 sweeps in four of 10 events on the first day to put the Crimson solidly in second at the halfway point of the meet.
Saturday’s events saw Harvard gain momentum, as the team accrued wins from Boyd in the 500 freestyle and the lineup of Lutz, Yakubovich, O’Hara, and sophomore Ed Kim in the 400 freestyle relay.
Paced by those results, the Crimson earned a top-three finish in every event of the second day but one, including third-place marks for O’Hara, Osada, and sophomore Shane McNamara in the 100 free, 200 back, and 200 breast, respectively.
A second-place finish from O’Hara, Tan, Yakubovich, and Lutz in the 200 medley relay also helped to narrow the gap between Harvard and Princeton in the team scores.
“After not doing as well as we wanted in our relays last year, it was great seeing all our relays do so well,” junior Aly Abdel Khalik said. “We’re all excited to see how they do at Ivies, and this meet set that up perfectly.”
Nonetheless, the Tigers would hold strong to walk away with the overall victory, with Yale firmly in last.
Although Princeton managed to end the Crimson’s three-year streak in the H-Y-P meet, a number of individual results bode well for Harvard as the team returns to training before making another trip to DeNunzio Pool for the Ivy League Championships on February 25.
“We know Princeton is going to be tough to beat, but we believe that with the work we’ve put in this season, we are in a great position to put up a good fight at Ivies and hopefully come out with the win,” Abdel Khalik said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After dropping the doubles point in a nail-biter tiebreak at third doubles, it came down to two singles matches at the Murr Tennis Center on Friday. No. 33 Harvard men’s tennis (3-2) needed victories from both junior Brian Yeung at second singles and Andy Zhao at fifth singles to edge out No. 32 Tulane (4-1).
Both Yeung and Zhou managed to come back and battle into the third sets of their games after going down in the first set. In the deciding set, Yeung attempted to fight through sudden cramping, but ultimately Tulane sophomore Constantin Schmitz overpowered Yeung to take the match, 6-2, 6-7, 7-6. Though the Green Wave’s overall victory was already decided, Zhou finished his match and came out with a personal win.
“We really gave it our all at every position, no one stopped fighting,” co-captain Nicky Hu said. “Overall I’m proud of the guys, and there’s not much more we can ask for. Sometimes the points just don’t go our way.”
The day started with a close doubles lineup. Hu and Yeung fell to top-ranked Tulane senior Dominik Koepfer and junior Chi-Shan Jao, 6-3, at first doubles, while junior Sebastian Beltrame and sophomore Kenny Tao took home a 6-2 victory for the Crimson at second doubles.
In the decisive third doubles match, co-captain Conor Haughey and senior Kelvin Lam took on Schmitz and Tulane junior Sebastian Rey. In an extremely close back and forth, Haugey and Lam ultimately dropped the game in a tiebreak.
“We knew going into the match that Tulane was going to be a really tough team,” Hu said. “We went out with really good energy in doubles. They had a really good doubles lineup and our lineup is looking really solid right now too…. we lost in a real close one.”
Despite falling behind in the doubles competition, the Crimson came back with strong individual performances in the singles competition.
“It looked up and down our line that we had good energy, which is tough to do a lot of the time after losing a close double’s match like that,” Hu said. “I’m proud that the guys were able to rebound with positive energy there.”
At the number one spot, Hu took on Koepfer. In the Oracle/ITA’s first single’s poll of the 2016 season early this month, Koepfer became the first Green Wave player to take the title of the top single’s player in the country. Despite a strong effort from Hu, he fell 6-2, 6-4.
“He is a really, really good player so I didn’t really even give him a run for his money,” Hu said.
Beltrame battled through food poisoning to close out a tight tiebreaker win over his Tulane opponent, 7-6, 7-6 at third singles. At fourth singles, Tao delivered a smooth straight set win over Rey, 6-4, 6-2.
“Personally it was a good day because I lost my matches last week at TCU, so coming back, playing at home and getting a win in both double’s and single’s helped me restore my confidence a little bit,” the California native said.
Rounding out the ladder, Zhou took home the win at fifth singles while sophomore Grant Solomon fell to his opponent 6-3, 6-4 at sixth.
“Andy did a really good job of fighting through and trying to win the match even though it didn’t really matter,” Tao said.
With two more games this weekend, the team will have plenty of time to practice before facing Ivy League competition.
“We’re looking to really peak by the time we get to Ivy League season and NCAAs. That means maybe sacrificing some matches now because it takes some time to transition, so hopefully by the time NCAAs rolls around everyone will be playing the way they want to play,” Hu said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s tennis team (0-2, 0-1 Ivy League) is still waiting on its first victory of the season after a nail-biting loss against cross-town rival Boston College (1-1, 0-1 ACC). Playing at home, the Crimson took the Eagles to a seventh match after facing an early deficit.
After last weeks’ defeat to Cornell, Harvard once again fell 4-3, with the contest again being decided in the final match.
The Crimson found itself in a hole early on, as Boston College dominated doubles with strong performances all around. Of the three matches the Eagles claimed victory in two by a score of 6-3 which deemed the third match redundant. That match ended unfinished and knotted at 4-4.
“I think in doubles it could have gone either way,” junior June Lee said. “But they were more aggressive at the net.”
With the loss in the doubles competition, Harvard was down 1-0 in terms of points. The six single bouts, each counting for a point, would determine the outcome of the match.
Lee went up against the Eagles’ Lexi Borr in what was a dominant performance. She dispatched Borr in straight sets (6-4, 6-3), and leveled the score at 1 apiece.
The two squads traded blows for the next four matches.
In the fifth singles game and with BC up 3-2, Harvard captain Amy He was fighting to keep the Crimson in the tie. Though the contest was on the line, she shrugged it off and took control, winning comfortably in straight sets against BC’s Jennifer Ren 6-4, 6-2, to force game 7.
In the last set it came down to freshman Sabrina Xiong, in a winner takes all matchup. For any player this would represent a daunting task, but for a freshman that extra degree of pressure could set in.
Her earlier doubles match went unfinished and she would need that energy in what turned out to be a long and difficult contest.
On the other side of the court, standing in the way of a Xiong and a Harvard victory was the accomplished freshman Jacqueline Urbiniti, who as a senior in high school, was a five-star recruit.
The match got off to a fantastic start, with both players going back and forth, battling their way to a first set tie break.
However, Urbiniti would keep her calm and win the tie break, claiming the first set.
Though fresh from a grueling first set defeat, Xiong came out strong in the second, claiming breakpoint after breakpoint. Her strong forehand and pinpoint serve gave her the advantage on her serve, and her returns aided her in winning the set at 6-2.
“Sabrina did an amazing job of fighting and I think she handled the pressure of that really well,” Lee said. “I think it's a great learning experience for everyone, especially the freshman.”
The third set went much like the first. Urbiniti did a much better job at protecting her serve and Xiong did not show any signs of losing her serve until late. Urbiniti finally broke through, and went on to claim the third set 7-5 and the victory for the Eagles.
The players iterate that much work is still to be done after this tough start.
“I think we definitely need to work on execution and just making that one extra shot under pressure which makes a difference in a match,” Lee said.
“We are not taking this loss lightly,” sophomore Annika Ringblom said, “and we will back working hard tomorrow to show what we are really made of at ECACs next weekend.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

A couple of career highs in points fueled the Harvard women’s basketball team (8-9, 3-1 Ivy) to a weekend sweep in New York this weekend, as the Crimson downed both Cornell and Columbia on back-to-back days.
Harvard overcame a fourth quarter buzzer-beater by the Big Red (10-7, 2-1) on Friday night to win, 65-56, in overtime. They were led by senior co-captain Kit Metoyer, who notched a career-high 26 points to go along with seven rebounds and six assists.
Less than 24 hours later, the Crimson staved off a couple of late Lions (11-8, 0-4) runs to notch a 69-66 victory. Senior co-captain AnnMarie Healy paced the team with a career-high 27 points while shooting 13-of-14 (92.9%) from the field.
After ending the non-conference schedule with five losses in of six games, the Crimson has opened up the Ancient Eight portion of the season with three wins in four attempts. It is a stark contrast from last season, when they defeated just one of their first four conference opponents.
“It’s definitely a confidence booster,” junior forward Destiny Nunley said. “I thought maybe we had a tougher non-conference schedule… but like I said, we don’t really give up, and we look only at the next game. We’re not looking too far down the road.”
Harvard 65, Cornell 56
Harvard opened up on Friday with an overtime victory at Newman Arena. Metoyer led the way, making six of 11 three-pointers on the way to a career high 26 points.
Cornell was paced by Nia Marshall and Megan LeDuc, who each scored 17 points in 41 minutes.
The Crimson and Big Red remained locked throughout the first quarter until Cornell rode a 10-2 run to finish the period, grabbing a 17-13 lead.
A Metoyer triple started Harvard’s response, however, and by halftime Harvard had scored 12 unanswered points to take a 30-21 advantage.
Marshall made two jump shots to open the second half, cutting into the Crimson’s lead, but a pair of Metoyer triples to end the third quarter gave Harvard a 42-31 lead heading into the final frame.
The Big Red started the fourth quarter with 10 unanswered points, but senior guard Shilpa Tummala sank two insurance free throws to extend the lead to three with just 43 seconds left. A 25-foot buzzer-beater by LeDuc, however, tied things up at 52 to force overtime.
“We don’t ever give up,” Nunley said. “Especially when they hit the buzzer-beater, we were really down for a second, but then we were like, ‘Alright, what’s next? Let’s finish it out strong, let’s not give them another chance,’ and that’s what we did.”
The Crimson started quickly in the overtime period, with a pair of field goals and four Tummala free throws burying Cornell just two minutes in.
“A lot of teams I coached in the past would not have been able to handle the overtime, and maybe would have let it slip away,” coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “I loved that we were gritty, I loved that we were tough, and I loved that we were able to dominate the overtime.”
Harvard 69, Columbia 66
In a potential trap game after the hard-fought overtime win the night before, Harvard held off a pesky Columbia squad to win its third straight road game in conference play.
Healy’s career-high 27 points required just fourteen field goal attempts. It is the most points scored by a Crimson player since last March, when Temi Fagbenle ‘15 scored 31, also at Columbia.
“[AnnMarie] was immense, they couldn’t stop her,” Delaney-Smith said. “They eventually started to double team her, but even that didn’t stop her. She was just in a zone today, and did a great job.”
The teams traded runs early, with Harvard’s 12-3 start cancelled out by a 10-4 Lions run that knotted the score at 22 in the second quarter. Two Healy baskets closed out the half, giving her 19 points and Harvard a 35-32 lead at the intermission.
The game remained back-and-forth throughout, with the score tied up at 64 with 2:27 to play. Taking a handoff from Nunley, freshman guard Madeline Raster connected from downtown to give the Crimson a lead it would not relinquish.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 22 Harvard women’s water polo team jumpstarted its 2016 season by cruising to a two-match sweep at Blodgett Pool on opening day Saturday, beating Villanova 14-4 before downing Iona in similar fashion, 14-5.
The Crimson (2-0) spearheaded its performances with dominating defense. In goal, freshman Sam Acker and sophomore Cleo Harrington started for Harvard, combining for 17 stops across both games.
“Everything we talk about starts on the defensive end,” head coach Ted Minnis said. “Our defense is going to fuel our counter, which feeds our offense. We spent more time in the week talking about the defensive end than we’ve spent talking about any other phase of the game.”
With the two wins, the Crimson moved to 13-2 on opening days.
HARVARD 14, IONA 5
Iona (1-1) started its season off by eking out an upset win over Brown, but Harvard was able to shut its party down a match later. Freshman attacker Kristen Hong started the scoring early while senior attacker Yoshi Andersen followed with her first score of the year, and the Crimson rode a 9-2 halftime lead to a 14-5 victory over the Gaels in the afternoon game on Saturday.
“We wanted to come out really hard, to be aggressive and match their intensity,” Harrington said. “We just came out fired up.”
Harvard did just that, using a 5-goal first-quarter and shutdown defense to build an insurmountable lead early on. With the lead in hand, the Crimson’s pestering defense refused to allow the Gaels a clear shot.
“We wanted to press and make sure that we didn’t give them any easy passes,” Harrington said. “[Coach] Ted always says, ‘defense first, offense second, great games start with defense’—so I think we just had that mindset.”
Junior 2-meter Melissa Balding kept the team’s foot on the gas with three second-half goals, all blistering shots, one of which bounced off the right post but still found the back of the net. Balding was third on last year’s Harvard team with 50 goals.
On the younger side of the team, the freshman core of Hong and utilities Nikki Daurio and Colby Stapleton combined for five scores against Iona, a performance that has given the team high expectations for the years to come, even after the Crimson notched a team-best 20-13 record last year and graduated three seniors.
“We have some really good freshman, as you can see,” Harrington said. “Everyone’s super pumped about them, tons of amazing returning players. I’m really excited about this team.”
HARVARD 14, VILLANOVA 4
Harvard swept Villanova last season, blowing the Wildcats out both times the teams played, and Saturday followed the same trend. The Crimson opened its season with a morning 14-4 win over Villanova (1-1), using strong contributions from its freshman attacking group and a second-half shutout to continue its dominance over the Wildcats. Hong led the way with five goals, pacing a Harvard team that led 8-4 after two quarters.
“I think we had a little first-game jitters and excitement going on,” Minnis said, regarding the four first-half goals that the defense gave up. “But I think really it comes back to us playing together and working as a group out there, staying on the same page.”
Acker, as a freshman starting the season opener in goal, came out of the halftime break and shut out the Wildcats for the rest of the game.
Her fellow freshmen—Hong, Stapleton, and Daurio—did their part on the other end of the pool, combining for eight goals in the game. In her own right, Acker, turning the Crimson’s stifling defense into counterattacks the other way, also contributed in the second quarter with a beautiful distance outlet pass to senior attacker Charlotte Hendrix, who delivered for her first goal of the season.
“We talk a lot about—it doesn’t matter if everybody knows what we’re doing, as long as we’re on the same page, we’re going to be a tough team to beat,” Minnis said. “I think that that showed today, and that was a great way to start the season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Led by strong performances from freshman Gabby Thomas and sophomore Jay Hebert, the Harvard track and field teams set a number of personal records at the annual HYP meet this weekend. Both the men’s and women’s teams finished in second place behind Princeton.
In a trend that is starting to feel familiar, Thomas led the way for the Crimson female squad, with first-place finishes in the triple jump and the 60 meter dash. Thomas’s collegiate career is off to a blazing start: last weekend, she set a personal best in the 200 meter dash—good for first overall among all freshman sprinters in the nation—and now has won at least one race in every meet of the year so far.
Thomas’s time of 7.51 seconds in the 60 meter barely edged out the 7.56 second dash run by teammate and fellow freshman Ngozi Musa, who would go on to claim victory in the 200 meter with a personal best of 24.80 seconds.
“The freshmen [this year] are really awesome, which kind of just shows the caliber of team that Harvard has,” junior hurdler Jade Miller said. “We’re able to recruit good girls who could have gone to a lot of other top-tier track schools.”
Miller herself set a personal best in the 400 meter dash, with her time of 54.80 seconds good enough for second only behind teammate Autumne Franklin—who ran a 54.39, also a personal best. But the personal records didn’t stop there: sophomore Marlee Sabatino also cleared a career-high 12’9.5” in the pole vault to claim second.
“I was really happy with how the meet went for me,” Sabatino said. “I had a lot of problems in warm-ups and was very unsure about how I was going to compete that day, but ended up turning it around…. I’m still hoping to jump a lot higher.”
Elsewhere, junior All-American Nikki Okwelogu dominated the shot put with a season-best 54’8.75”—a full 14 feet better than second place, and a mark that would have earned her third in the men’s shot put.  Junior Jackie Modesett also scored a victory in the 60 meter hurdles.
The men’s squad was led by sophomore Jay Hebert, who set a personal record in the 60 meter hurdle with a time of 8.16 seconds, a mark good for second all-time in the Crimson record books.
“It definitely surprised me too,” Hebert said. “The conditions out there weren’t the best, so to go out and drop a personal record made me feel really good and made me think about what I could do if I did have perfect conditions.”
The conditions didn’t stop freshman Myles Marshall from claiming a personal high of 1:03.34 in the 500 meter dash, good for second at the meet and third all-time in Harvard history. The men’s squad also scored second in four other events, including two season-bests by senior Malcolm Mason Rodriguez in the long jump and triple jump.
Overall, the men’s team finished a considerable margin behind Princeton in the standings, with 35 points to Princeton’s 112, but is confident in its ability to improve on last year’s 5th place finish in the Ivy Championships.
“[Physically], we just need to get a lot of the people that we have healthy, because we have a lot of talent that’s injured and hasn’t run this year so far,” Hebert said. “As far as team mentality though, we’re probably in a better spot than we were last year.”
To the team, though, HYP is less about winning and more about preparing for the Ivy Championships come February.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

It was a tale of two teams this weekend at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center, as the Harvard women’s hockey team showed up Saturday afternoon and played a dominant 60 minutes of hockey after being shut out by Quinnipiac the previous evening.
The Crimson (12-8-1, 9-6-1 ECAC) came out strong against Princeton (17-5-1, 10-5-1) with the most goals in a game since Jan. 9, beating the Tigers 4-1.
“I think we played 60 minutes of really great hockey and did what we were looking to do,” head coach Katey Stone said. “We had a great forecheck and took care of the puck. We had very few turnovers and today was a very good day for us.”
Both teams defenses came out of the gate ready to play, allowing neither offense to take a shot on goal in the first four minutes of play. Princeton broke the silence with the first two swats at the back of the net, but it was the Crimson that put together the first successful scoring drive of the afternoon.
Sophomore forward Karly Heffernan scored her fifth goal of the season off of a scramble in front of Princeton goalie Kimberly Newell which led to Heffernan’s shot that found the back of the net.
For its second tally of the night the Crimson was able to push the puck into Tiger territory and senior forward Miye D’Oench took a shot from the left hash in front of the goal. The shot was stopped in front of the net by a line of Princeton defenders, but junior forward Sydney Daniels was able to take advantage of a deflection and with help from classmate Briana Mastel poked the puck to the back of the Tigers’ net.
After being unable to muster much offense the previous day, the two goals early in the game were able to set the tone on the ice.
“[Scoring early] is huge,” D’Oench said. “You play the game slightly differently when you’re up and obviously you always want to have the same sense of urgency but you get to play it a little bit more conservatively and take less chances when you’re up.”
Following the first intermission Princeton immediately responded to its deficit. In a drive off the second faceoff of the period, Tiger forward Morgan Sly was able to get the puck past Harvard goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer with the help of Karlie Lund.
Maschmeyer played another solid game in goal for the Crimson, recording 34 saves off of the 35 shots seen, bringing her save percentage up to .951.
D’Oench responded with her eleventh goal of the season, short handing a pass from senior forward Michelle Picard and taking a shot from the left side of the net which hit the post and then the netting.
“It was sort of a fortuitous bounce,” D’Oench said. “There was a scramble in front of the net and the puck popped out to the point and they shot it and it dribbled out to my stick off to the side…. I one timed it and thought with my luck it was going to hit off the post and go out but this time it went in which was nice.”
D’oench finished the game with a goal and two assists, boosting her already team leading point total to 25.
The third period remained quiet for both teams until the concluding minutes of regulation. With two minutes and 33 seconds left in the game, sophomore forward Haley Mullins was sent to the penalty box for two minutes after being called for checking. This gave Princeton a man up advantage. To put even more pressure on Harvard’s defense, the Tigers then pulled their goalie, making it a 6-on-4 advantage on the ice. Despite playing with two fewer players on the ice, the Crimson was able to stay strong defensively and hold its opponent from scoring.
“The good part of that situation was that [Princeton called] a timeout and we had a regular media timeout so we had some time to go through things on the sideline and I think our kids played that tremendously,” Stone said.
With the net still empty after the power play kill, Daniels took the opportunity to give her team an insurance goal when she scored an empty-net goal with the help of D’Oench with 12 seconds left in the game, sealing the 4-1 victory.
Harvard was able to kill all three of the opposition’s power plays throughout the night, which has been a point of improvement the team had looked to work on coming into Saturday’s contest.
Saturday’s victory was Harvard’s first win against a top ten team since scoring six goals against Clarkson on Jan. 9. With an upcoming schedule that includes a match up against top ranked Boston College, the Crimson will enter February with a win against a ranked opponent under its belt.
“We’ve hit a little bit of a rough patch in the past few weeks and I think the coaches have been going back to doing the little things and I think tonight was a great improvement,” D’Oench said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A pair of battles between ECAC heavyweights saw the Harvard women’s ice hockey teams split games against No.4/4 Quinnipiac and No.9/9 Princeton. After dropping a 1-0 decision to Quinnipiac in a defensive brawl, the Crimson bounced back to defeat Princeton by a 4-1 margin.
A TALE OF TWO GAMES 
The few fans who showed up for both games would be hard pressed to find many similarities between the two Crimson’s performances this weekend. After the team struggled on almost all fronts against Quinnipiac and was outplayed on Friday, Saturday’s matchup saw Harvard play one of its arguably most complete games of the season against the Tigers.
While the team struggled to gain momentum early on against the Bobcats, it aggressively attacked the Princeton goal and scored two goals in the first frame, en route to its first game with more than two goals after failing to do so in the five previous games.
Additionally, the penalty kill was pivotal for the Crimson in the latter game. After allowing Quinnipiac to score on its only power play of the night, Harvard killed all four of Princeton’s power plays on Saturday. Among those kills was an impressive shutdown of a 6-on-4 power play after Tiger goalie Kimberly Newell was pulled from the net for another forward in an attempt to narrow the then-two goal deficit.
“We were on them, right away,” said Harvard coach Katey Stone on Saturday. “I thought our forecheck was the difference today in the game… I’m happy they got the win today because [the team] certainly earned it.”
MASCH'S MESH 
One constant in both games was the stellar play of co-captain and goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer. The Bruderheim, Alberta native–who is the Crimson’s all-time leader in saves–held two potent offenses to a mere two goals, while posting a combined 72 saves including a season-high 37 against Quinnipiac.
“Emerance came really big for us, especially at the end,” said senior forward Miye D’Oench after the Princeton game. “I don’t know how she saved a couple of those.”
One could even argue that only one goal of the weekend's two was Maschmeyer’s fault. In the matchup against the Bobcats, it appeared that the netminder had been pushed out of the crease by a Quinnipiac player, allowing the puck to squeeze into the goal. While further review by the referees confirmed the goal stood–the refs claimed one of Maschmeyer’s teammates had caused the incident by bumping into the Quinnipiac player who pushed Maschmeyer–it was the only blemish for the goalie.
The senior’s play between the sticks has been pivotal to the success of the Crimson this season. Maschmeyer is currently ranked second in the nation in save percentage and seventh in goals against average and more than held her own against fellow elite goalkeepers and Quinnipiac and Princeton counterparts Sydney Rossman and Newell, outdueling the latter on Saturday.
“We got a great effort from [Maschmeyer],” Stone said. “She’s been amazing… To be able to weather the penalties at the end, the 6-on-4, I’m proud of our kids.”
SITTING ON THE BUBBLE
Though the weekend’s split gave Harvard two points in a tight-knit conference race, there is still plenty of work to be done if the Crimson wishes to extend its season as long as possible.
Harvard currently sits fifth in the conference, meaning it would have to play an extra series and then go on the road for its quarterfinals matchup in the ECAC post-season tournament were it to make it that far. While a post-season conference championship would guarantee a spot in the NCAA Tournament, the Crimson would likely have to go through opponents such as Quinnipiac once again.
If Harvard fails to win the ECAC, a wild-card berth is not guaranteed. With only eight teams making the playoff field, and four of those going to conference champions, the Crimson would likely have to be ranked within the top eight nationally in order to vie for one of the four remaining spots.
With Harvard currently outside the top-10 in the PairWise Rankings, it has plenty of work to do to regain its ranking. The road to recovery starts this Tuesday, as Harvard will get its second crack at No.1/1 Boston College in the semifinals of the Beanpot. A win against the then-top ranked Eagles in the 2015 Beanpot Finals helped spark a run of play which saw the Crimson finish as national runner-ups.
While it may be tempting for the team to get caught looking ahead, the team insists it will take the road one game at a time, starting with its matchup on Tuesday.
“The trick is to take it one game at a time,” D’Oench said. “You focus on the next enemy. Right now it’s BC so we’re focusing on that for now.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Until this past Friday night, it had been two seasons since Harvard wrestling registered a dual meet win against Ivy League foe Columbia. With a winning streak, and a chance at redemption on the line, the Crimson brought the heat into the Lions’ den to notch the victory, 22-14.
“To go out and beat Columbia this week, especially following our big win against Bucknell last week, it was validation that we really are turning the corner as a team,” sophomore Josef Johnson said. “There’s really high energy right now, and I think the biggest takeaway for us was that it was another great team win.”
With a forfeit at the 125 position in previous weeks due to injury, the Crimson saw a major change as freshman Nolan Hellickson took to the mat to start out the meet.
“Getting Nolan back at 125 was big, and he started the fire from the get go,” Harvard coach Jay Weiss said. “Following his win there, I think our guys were really able to feed off each other’s energy, and that was exciting to watch.”
Following Hellickson’s decisive 18-0 technical fall victory, senior captain Todd Preston, who is ranked ninth in the nation in the 141 division, kept the momentum going for the Crimson.
“With Todd I think we saw a side of him we hadn’t seen in a while,” Johnson said. “He honestly got really nasty this match, and we saw a ferocity that we hadn’t seen out of him in a little bit so it was really nice to see him get after it.”
While these early victories put Harvard in solid position to notch the win, it was Johnson’s bout at 173 that stole the day. The sophomore managed to wrestle through overtime ticks to outlast Zack Hernandez, 9-7.
“That was a triple overtime, exciting match and he came out on top,” Weiss said. “So that’s got to help his confidence. Hernandez has beaten us in that weight class the past two years, and to qualify for the NCAA tournament, he’d knocked two of our guys out. So that was a really nice win for the team and for Josef.”
Another key contributor for the Crimson’s effort was junior Jeffrey Ott. Ott held on in a tight match to get a decision for the team, with a final score of 3-0.
“With Jeff at 133, he’d already lost to that guy a couple times already,” Weiss said. “So I love it when we have guys go out and avenge earlier losses. He looked strong and did a really good job out there.”
Senior Devon Gobbo also found a similar result against a previous competitor, beating Columbia’s Tyrel White 9-3.
“That guy (White) pinned us last year, so it was not only an intense loss but it was a pin,” Weiss said. “So Devon was wrestling one of their top guys and we almost got a major out of it, which is was awesome.  I wasn’t surprised by it because I know the level of wrestling that Devon is capable of, but that was a big one for us as a team.”
Senior Josh Popple also put points on the board for the Crimson, returning from injury to earn a major decision against Columbia’s Troy Hembury, 9-0.
“When Josh went out there, we didn’t need those points anymore for the win, but he still wrestled to win,” Weiss said. “It just shows you how people are feeding off each other and scoring points for the team. We have a really special group and I’m excited to see over the next couple weeks how they finish the season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s tennis team entered Sunday trying to avoid falling to .500 for the first time since early 2014. Holding a record of 3-2, it had already dropped games to No. 28 Oklahoma State and No. 32 Tulane. With another tough contest against a ranked opponent looming, this time No. 37 Drake, the Crimson had its work cut out to maintain its winning record.
By the end of the day, however, No. 32 Harvard (5-2) had claimed a victory over not only the Bulldogs (2-3), but also crosstown rivals Boston University (1-2).
The triumph over Drake in the morning featured a Crimson comeback and was won in a tense three-set affair, as Harvard squeaked by, 4-3.The afternoon game against the Terriers, on the other hand, was much more straightforward.The Crimson dominated from start to finish to earn the 7-0 win.
Harvard 7, BU 0
After sending out most of his more experienced players against the Bulldogs, Crimson coach Dave Fish ’72 called on his fresher, lesser-used underclassmen to face the Terriers.
These underclassmen responded impressively, dropping only one set across both singles and doubles. In the process, three freshmen earned their first official wins in dual-match play.
“The younger guys have been working just as hard as the regulars in practice,” Fish said. “It was good to see that work pay off today.”
Harvard set the tone right away against the Terriers by sweeping doubles. The pairing of junior Brian Yeung and freshman Andy Zhou, which is ranked No. 39 nationally in the ITA polls, delivered at the No. 1 spot with a 6-3 win over BU juniors Jake De Vries and Jay Leelavanich.
Christopher Morrow and Michael Peters, seeing the first dual-match action of their careers as doubles partners, powered to a 6-1 win to definitively take the doubles point for the Crimson.
In singles, Zhou battled BU senior William Kwok to a close, 7-6, 6-4 win. Fellow freshmen Morrow and Sam Beren also secured points for Harvard in straight sets. Morrow defeated Terriers junior Mario Sandoval, 6-4, 6-1, while Beren overcame BU freshman Jeff Chan, 6-3, 6-4.
For Morrow and Beren, the results were their first singles wins as college athletes.
“We were all in the same boat heading into the day, so it was good to get our first wins together,” Beren said. “Everyone was super supportive and it helped us stay loose and focused.”
Crimson sophomores Grant Solomon, Jean Thirouin, and Xavier Gonzalez all earned victories as well to cap off the dominant team performance.
Harvard 4, Drake 3
With the score knotted at 3-3, this matchup between two ITA Top-40 squads came down to a third set between Crimson junior Brian Yeung and Bulldogs freshman Vinny Gillespie.
Yeung, after losing the first set, 1-6, had pulled back to win the second set, 6-1. Riding his momentum, Yeung raced out to another commanding lead in the third set, and, up 5-1, needed just one more game to claim victory.
However, Gillespie held serve to pull to 5-2, broke Yeung to reach 5-3, and held serve again, pushing the set to 5-4. The next game reached a deuce point, but serving for the win, Yeung finally broke through.
“He [Yueng] did a great job of staying with his game,” Beren said. “He had a tough loss in a similar situation on Friday, so it was good to see him stay aggressive and not let nerves get to him this time.”
With the 1-6, 6-1, 6-4 result, Harvard defeated Drake in the overall proceedings, 4-3.
The match did not start quite as well as it finished for the Crimson, which quickly fell in a 0-2 hole after dropping the doubles point and seeing Bulldogs freshman Ben Clark beat Zhou, 6-3, 6-2.
On the back of strong play in the No. 1 and 2 spots by captain Nicky Hu and junior Sebastian Beltrame, Harvard fought back to tie the match. Kelvin Lam also earned a crucial victory before Yeung secured the clinching point for the Crimson.
“Our team believes in the saying that ‘successes are usually failures halfway through,’” Fish said. “I’m proud of how the team didn’t give up today and we pulled it out.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 1, 2016, at 12:00 a.m.
Steve Michalek reluctantly dropped his gloves as his teammates waved him on.
The former Harvard men’s hockey goaltender did not plan on resorting to pugilism in his first career American Hockey League start Saturday, but he had little choice after Charlotte Checkers goaltender Daniel Altshuller skated the length of the ice following the Iowa Wild’s fifth goal of the Des Moines matinee.
The goalies stared each other down before Michalek collared Altshuller with his left hand. Altshuller proceeded to pull Michalek’s jersey over his head, but Michalek knocked Altshuller off balance.
As the pair tumbled slowly to the ice, Michalek landed two high jabs before tackling his aggressor to the delight of the home crowd. Michalek finished his afternoon with 32 saves in the Wild’s 5-1 win and was named the game’s first star.
“It was great getting the first win out of the way, the first game out of the way,” Michalek said Sunday. “Definitely not how I imagined it happening, but it was fun.”
A year ago, Michalek grabbed hockey headlines for a more bittersweet accomplishment.
Before a TD Garden crowd that braved the icy conditions of a freshly-fallen blizzard, the senior goaltender fought off cramps to make 63 saves—a single-game record for the 64-year-old midseason classic that brings together Harvard, Boston University, Boston College, and Northeastern—but a costly turnover allowed BU to prevail two minutes into double overtime, 4-3, to deny the Crimson’s first berth in the tournament final since 2008.
“It was tough,” Michalek said. “I grew up wanting to play in a Beanpot school and win a Beanpot, and unfortunately it never happened…. That loss has really stung just as bad as any loss I can remember.”
Today, Michalek will follow the score from his home in Illinois as the No. 7/7 Crimson (12-4-3, 8-3-3 ECAC) open the 64th edition of the Beanpot against the No. 5/5 Boston College Eagles (17-4-4, 10-1-4 HE) 5 p.m. tonight at TD Garden.
While last year’s finalists, No. 9/10 BU and Northeastern, earned the primetime nightcap, the opener has the makings of a de facto championship game. After a 6-1 loss to Clarkson two weeks ago, Harvard has won three straight and sits fifth in the PairWise Rankings, one spot ahead of BC.
Co-captains Jimmy Vesey and Kyle Criscuolo pace the team with 16 and 14 goals, respectively, while four deep lines have helped the Crimson average an ECAC-best 3.84 goals per game.
Harvard’s last Beanpot title came in 1993, three months before Vesey was born.
“It’s just kind of been too long that we haven’t gotten one,” Vesey said after the Crimson’s 4-1 win over Princeton Friday. “We put it on our goals at the beginning of the year, and we’re going to go after it.”
For BC, Beanpot droughts are measured in months, not decades. The Eagles have won five of the last six tournaments and entered October as the national preseason No. 1 thanks to the nation’s top recruiting class. After three straight losses to end December, the Eagles went undefeated in January and recently celebrated coach Jerry York’s 1000th career win.
In goal, BC junior Thatcher Demko leads the NCAA with eight shutouts this year and backstopped BC’s last Beanpot title with a tournament-best .966 save percentage in 2013-2014. On the other side, Harvard’s Merrick Madsen has yet to play in a Beanpot after Michalek started every game for Harvard last season, but the sophomore has grown into the Crimson’s top option with a .936 save percentage, impressing his former teammate along the way.
“I remember talking with our goalie coach [Brian] Eklund about how good [Madsen] could really be if he put it all together this year,” Michalek said. “I’ve watched a lot of highlights and it looks like he’s really more than put it together, and it’s great to see. I know it was tough for him last year, but he was an unbelievable teammate, unbelievably supportive, and he worked hard all year to get better, and it’s really paying off.”
Michalek has yet to watch a full Harvard game this year, but he plans to look for a stream of today’s game.
“I believe in these guys,” Michalek said. “I’ll be definitely eager to see how they do.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard women’s swimming and diving fell short in the much-anticipated HYP meet, with Yale and Princeton both handing the Crimson its first losses of the season, 167 – 133 and 165 – 135 respectively.
The first day of the meet took the Crimson (5-2, 5-2 Ivy) by surprise, with the squads from both New Haven and Princeton coming out of the gate strong.
“On the first day of this meet, our cheering and our attitudes on the whole were a little lackluster,” sophomore Geordie Enoch said. “By [Sunday] morning, we definitely turned that around and left the meet proud of how we got behind one another. But we learned that we can't afford to make a switch like that at ivies; we need to have everything together from the start.”
Despite ending the weekend 0-for-2, Harvard still put up some noteworthy performances. The meet began with a second place finish in the 200 medley relay, with a time of 1:42.67—only 0.22 seconds behind the first place Tigers. The Crimson squad included senior Danielle Lee, Enoch, freshman Sonia Wang, and junior Victoria Chan.
Lee continued to put up strong performances throughout the meet, taking first in both the 100 and 200 backstroke, and competing in the fifth place 400 freestyle relay. In the 100, Lee touched the wall in 54.68.In the 200 she finished in 1:58.37, a full second ahead of the second place finisher, fellow Harvard senior Kendall Crawford.
Enoch attributes the grace under pressure to the swimmer’s rock-solid ties to one another.
“During training trip every year, we are able to get closer and really bond, so we know each other's strengths and weaknesses,” Enoch said.“Because we know each other so well, we can regroup and make sure we're doing everything we can, in and out of the water, to try and get back on track.”
Other standout performances included junior Daniela Johnson’s performance in the 200 free, taking third with a time of 1:49.79. In the same race, senior Margaret Ramsey took fourth in 1:50.81.
The older classes held the team down this meet, helping their younger teammates recover from the hits early on in the meet.
“The strong leadership from the juniors and seniors have also helped keep the energy high and nerves down in the underclassman in between sessions,” Lee said.
The team’s younger swimmers also impressed. Sophomore Katie Evans took third in the 100 breast, followed by Enoch in fifth. Wang continued to put up quality performances in her individual events as well, taking first in the 200 butterfly, with her time of 1:58.49 nearly two seconds ahead of the second place contender.
But the Crimson, battling fatigue, failed to put enough points on the board, even with these top finishes.
“The intensity and yardage in our workouts has not yet tapered off,” Lee said. “Most of us were tired and sore from practice going into this meet.”
On the platform, the Harvard diving contingent also saw its share of highs and lows. In the three meter, sophomore Jing Leung scored 277.55 to take home silver, while fellow freshman Katie Russ scored 269.10 to take bronze. In addition, another freshman, Mikaela Thompson, took sixth while junior Elina Leiviska placed eighth.
The one meter competition went similarly as well. Thompson placed the highest of the Crimson squad, taking second with 290.05. She was followed by Russ in fourth and Leung in seventh.
All in all, the weekend proved a tumultuous test of everyone’s nerves in preparation for Ivies.
“We are all looking to perfect and work on the little technical things such as our underwater kicks, our body positioning, or starts and turns to give us that extra edge for Ivies,” Lee said. “I am looking forward to continuing this energy and team support we have up until Ivies.”

You’re well rested, well fed, possibly a little tanner if you went somewhere warm: you just got back from a vacation.
While Harvard might be considered a beacon of shining light in the academic world, in meteorological terms, Boston is pretty mediocre. It’s cold, wet, and the sun sets before you even start to mentally wake up. After spending my winter break abroad, further South, or in the warm sun of California, it can be hard to readjust to Cambridge life. So how can one overcome their post-vacation woes? If you posses the super-human ability to simply block something from your memory, then by all means use it. However, if you’re a mere mortal like us, you’ll have to resort to different mechanisms.
One option is to simply commit to far more academic and extracurricular commitments than you know is feasible. This technique, which is especially common amongst freshmen, is a surefire way to  forget your vacation, and also make your life miserable. Having employed this strategy a number of times in the past, we at Flyby can confirm that this isn’t the way you want to do things.
Another slightly less painful way to get over your vacation is to do something fun. Yes, we know, it's a novel idea to do something "fun" that is not "productive." But maybe try to pick up a new skill like doing pottery, or read a book for fun, or go to one of Boston's many museums. Even listening to music and taking a walk down the Charles can help you readjust to Harvard life.
Or you could convince your parents to visit you at college (unfortunately, we at Flyby are #unloved and thus un-visited). It’s still early enough in the semester that you don’t really have too much work, so you’ll have time to hang out with them. Spending time with parents can be highly therapeutic and make home feel a little bit closer. Plus, they’ll wine and dine you.
Your last option, of course, is to take another vacation. Seriously. There are so many opportunities here to travel abroad (maybe  even on Harvard’s dime). If you spend your entire semester anticipating your next vacation, you’ll surely get over your post-vacation woes.

Flyby exec and amateur astrologist Kyle E. O’Hara counts many things among her talents—her impressive ability to drink Diet Coke before 10 a.m., her dogged pursuit of the position of El Jefe’s #1 customer, and her remarkable skill at napping at inopportune times. But most prominent of these talents is her questionable-at-best ESP. Check back on the first of each month for your Flyby Horoscope, courtesy of Kyle.
As a hard hitting journalist-blogger, it is my duty to bring you, dear readers, the #facts. Moreover, as a scientist*, I am here to tell you that nothing is more factually legitimate than horoscopes. Horoscopes help us figure out what to do with our love lives and careers better than any honest-to-goodness introspection or serious talks with our friends and mentors ever could. Here is just a sliver of my infinite wisdom to help guide you through your February:
AQUARIUS: Last semester, you took a risk, and your courage paid off. Remember that when evaluating this semester’s schedule—concentration credits are not everything. Try out the things that you find interesting. The stars are telling me that the best choice you can make this month is to comp The Crimson.
PISCES: You often find yourself overthinking the small things in your life. Declutter your Google Calendar, and make some time to be alone with yourself. Rethinking your priorities will allow you to soar. You are going to see success in your extracurriculars in February, especially if you comp The Crimson.
ARIES: You spend much of your mental energy trying to keep up with friends, with trends, with classes. You often feel that things are slipping from your grasp, but don’t know why or how. This month, realize that relaxing and and trusting yourself to handle it allows you to effortlessly keep up. Blogging is in this month — comp Flyby.
TAURUS: You occasionally struggle to express yourself. You wonder if your friendships are still strong as when they began, or now exist out of convenience. Seek out people with whom you share passions, not just proximity. Your social life will become infinitely better this month when you meet your fellow Crimson compers.
GEMINI: Heartbreak can be hard to deal with, especially when you have to see that person around campus. This month will be important for self-exploration, accepting, and moving on. Looking for new love? You may just find it among your fellow writers at The Crimson.
CANCER: After a long fall semester, you feel as if you may be stuck in a rut. It’s all too easy to fall into the same habits, even when they don’t make you happy. February will be a month of internal conflict, but working to expand your interests will serve you well. Learn a new skill this month — comp Crimson Multimedia.
LEO: Rethinking your choice of concentration can be scary, but it is important to take a step back and make sure you still feel passionate about your concentration before you dedicate more hours of study to it. The answer may be that you don’t—but don’t let this scare you. Harvard has a lot more to offer. Seek intellectual fulfillment at The Harvard Crimson.
VIRGO: Winter break was a transformative time for you. You’ve returned to campus feeling refreshed and ready to take on a new semester. This month, you will be relaxed and motivated enough to do your readings—even for your Gen Ed. Share your productivity with the world this month by joining the staff of The Crimson.
LIBRA: A quick look at your bank account balance shows that you must keep an eye on your late-night spending habits this month. An on-campus job will not only cover your post-party trips to Felipe’s, but will help you learn the importance of budgeting and self-control. February will bring financial success if you comp The Crimson Biz Board.
SCORPIO: The state of your dorm room reflects the state of your mind. Take some time this February for Spring cleaning. You will feel more calm once you see that everything has its own place. Be productive this month by joining The Crimson’s comp.
SAGITTARIUS: You came to a large realization this winter break that has allowed you to see the world, and your life, in a new light. Remember that feeling of epiphany, even as you start to get bogged down in work this semester. This February, you will have to work hard to hold on to this new perspective, but it will be worth it. Talk about your feelings — comp Editorial.
CAPRICORN: February is often a hard month at Harvard, with short days, tall snowbanks, and lonely Valentine’s Day. However, this February will be unlike the others for you. Keep a positive outlook and positive things will happen. This month holds success in every facet of your life, as long as you comp The Crimson!

Mobile apps can be overwhelming. With over 1.5 million apps available for download in leading app stores, it’s difficult to figure out which apps are truly essential to our happiness and well-being on campus. What else do we Harvard students need besides Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat? Turns out, there are a few more important apps that deserve a place in all of our phones.
TinderWant to meet new people, but too afraid to talk to them in real life? Try Tinder! Whether you’re looking for a significant other, a hook-up buddy, or just a friend, you are sure to match with plenty of fascinating people—including that one kid from your section that you didn’t mean to swipe right on.
BumbleSometimes, one app just isn’t enough. Bumble is another popular dating app commonly used on campus. Created by the same person who made Tinder, Bumble is different from Tinder in that women have to message men first, and matches expire after 24 hours if no one makes the first move. Also, rumor has it that the people on Bumble are more attractive. Who knows?
OmniGet all the latest information on shuttle times and HUDS menu so you know whether you should walk to class or keep waiting for the shuttle, and whether you should get excited for waffle fries at lunch or avoid the dining hall altogether on a given day.
UberLate for class, stuck in Boston when the T has stopped running, inebriated, or just downright lazy? Uber is here to save the day. Whether you’re taking a 20-minute journey into Boston or a quick 2-minute stint from Tasty Burger to your room, this handy app has got your back.
LyftIf the surge price on Uber is way too high, or if you consider Uber too mainstream, give Lyft a shot instead. As a bonus, the cars are easily identifiable with a 5-inch-long pink “glowstache” that drivers put on the dashboard.
VenmoWe all have that moment when we walk into Felipe’s and realize that we forgot our wallet. Gone are the days of owing someone money, struggling to find exact change, and subsequently engaging in a wild goose chase as you try to find the person so you can give them their $12.48. Thanks to Venmo, you can pay your friend back immediately, and throw in a fun emoji for kicks.
Pic StitchIf it’s your best friend’s birthday and you want to show the whole world how much you love each other, why not make a lovely photo collage of all the good times you two have had? That’s what everyone else does, at least.
GroupMeWelcome to GroupMe, the (un)official means of communication for large groups of people. This includes any and all extracurricular organizations, social clubs, and other conglomerations of random people. Get ready for endless notifications.

The Chipotle E. Coli outbreak was without a doubt the biggest national crisis of 2015. Not a day goes by that I don’t think about how much better my life would be with a burrito bowl and the best chips and guac in Cambridge. And to think of the class of 2019, deprived of the source of so much of the Freshman 15 during their first semester. Truly tragic.
We at Flyby have great news for everyone feeling the lack of Chipotle as much as us: it’s (probably, almost) safe to go back!!!!!! The CDC is expected to end its investigation ASAP, so we can all get back to rationalizing needing to skip HUDS dinner another time this week for a burrito. I personally can return to my very professional habit of arriving to meetings with a burrito bowl in my purse (don’t act like you’ve never done it).
After months of putting our health above our immediate Mexican food needs (for once), we can at last return to doing what we as college students do best: mistreating our bodies without worrying about the consequences. Before we know it, our trashcans will be filled with empty Chipotle containers that will serve as a sign of our nutritional and fiscal irresponsibility.
Felipe’s can finally go back to being our late-night drunken compromise instead of our main option for Mexican food in the Square, thank goodness. Because we all know El Jefe’s wasn’t gonna make the cut, no matter how dire the situation got.
