After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After leading a master class at the Harvard Dance Center this past Friday on the Alvin Ailey/Horton technique, dancer Antonio M. Douthit stretched out on the studio floor and gave workshop attendees a brief account of his first foray into dance.
“We should have been arrested,” laughed Douthit, a St. Louis native, as he recalled how he and two friends heard the sound of percussion through the window of a local dance studio, entered, and asked to participate in the class. The instructor allowed their group to dance that afternoon, and invited them to return the following day. Douthit came back repeatedly to dance and launched a brilliant career that brought him in 2004 to his current position as a company dancer of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater.
Douhtit’s visit to Harvard’s campus was coordinated by Stephanie L. Riven, a visiting practitioner at the Graduate School of Education and founder of the Center of Creative Arts (COCA), the St. Louis-based organization where Douthit completed his early dance training. There, he was enrolled in the pre-professional dance program, where he received mentorship and resources that allowed him to pursue jobs with several prominent companies including Dance Theatre of Harlem and Les Grands Ballets Canadiens de Montréal.
While his career has taken him all over the United States, Douthit remains very committed to outreach in his hometown. “Antonio comes to St. Louis each year to give back to the community, to teach young students who’ve had experiences similar to his,” said Riven. “He is a great mentor and very much admired in St. Louis for what he’s been able to achieve.”
When he has finished dancing professionally, Douthit plans to open a small community center in St. Louis that will provide quality dance education to young people growing up in a sometimes unpredictable urban environment.
On April 22, Douthit led assembled dancers from the Harvard community in a series of demanding combinations originating in the Horton technique. The Horton approach incorporates elements of many cultures’ native and folk traditions, and has strongly influenced the Ailey Company’s distinctive choreographic style.
Despite the challenging nature of the Horton-based exercises, Douthit stressed that his primary goal for students in the workshop was to have fun. “A lot of times when you do master classes, people have been training for a long time,” Douthit said. “You want to give out valuable information, but you want to let [students] have fun with what they’re doing, and not have them feel that it’s just another technique or strengthening class.”
A few of the dancers in the Friday class had also participated in previous Ailey intensives offered at Harvard, such as Dramatic Arts 123: “The Ailey Legacy,” and returned to revisit their experiences. “I think what the Horton and Ailey technique offers is ... a dance form that calls upon your physical reserves—calls upon muscularity, focus, [and] technique,” said Christine Bennett, assistant dance director at the OFA, who organized and also danced in the workshop. “[The Horton technique] is extremely codified and there’s a history there. If you’ve ever seen Alvin Ailey you know that the result is an exquisitely fine-tuned physical instrument ... This kind of technique is an inspiration for dancers.”
Douthit’s routines preserved the challenges inherent to his art form—the participants explored ways of moving that required them to isolate upper body from lower body, bend their torsoes from side to side, and work their laterals and core muscles.
Though the routines were undoubtedly rigorous, they were tackled by dancers of all levels who faced the more challenging exercises with a sense of humor buoyed by the supportive and lighthearted atmosphere. According to Bennett, this open, non-competitive environment is a great benefit of the Harvard dance program, and one that the staff hopes to continue fostering in the coming year. “Something to think about and something I hope to do is to add a few more classes on culturally based dance forms with no barrier to entry,” said Bennett. Even so, Douthit was impressed by the talent that he saw during the workshop. “Harvard rocks,” said Douthit. “No, seriously ... you would think because it’s such an academic school there would not be such a strong dance program, but I was taken aback by how strong some of the dancers were.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The story of Kevin Shee’s ’11 artistic trajectory as one of the most prominent, respected, and genuinely well-liked members of the Harvard dance community began like that of many others. Shee, who began training in dance at the age of five, was by his teens well-versed in jazz, tap, ballet, and lyrical dance. He had planned on quitting dance as a pre-frosh but soon discovered that the college offered of an impressive number of classes, performing groups, guest choreographers, and other resources for the serious dancer. Shee decided to continue with the art and never looked back. His colleagues and mentors attest that since his very first semester, he has stood out not only as one of the most versatile and technically accomplished of the College’s male dancers. Yet Shee has also been one of the most artistically open—and has come to play a truly special role in the Harvard dance community at large.
Throughout his career at Harvard, Shee has held principal roles in such varied pieces as Jaime Blanc’s “The Rite of Spring,” Twyla Tharp’s “Sinatra Suite,” and numerous student-choreographed ballet and jazz pieces. Along with these roles with the Harvard Ballet Company (HBC), Shee is also a member of the Harvard Asian American Dance Troupe (AADT) and the Harvard Breakers. As his fellow dancers note, Shee’s talents as a dancer are as versatile as these performing groups are distinct. As Marin J. Orlosky-Randow ’07-’08 said, “When Kevin came to Harvard he was already physically gifted, which he’s maintained over the years and everyone can see. He’s also grown artistically; I think he’s become a more thoughtful performer, and I’ve seen him become more introspective." Ricky D. Kuperman ’11, a student choreographer who has worked directly with Shee, also attests that while his exceptional physical abilities are certainly not to be ignored, his talents go beyond technique. “He’s exactly the kind of dancer any choreographer wants to work with. He is incredibly open to trying difficult or new movements, and willing to take serious artistic risks.”
Due to his remarkable repertoire, Shee holds a special place in Harvard’s dance scene. Virtually the only dancer seriously involved in different groups as the AADT and HBC, he has become an integral part of campus dance organizations that, according to him, don’t often have much contact. Nonetheless, he seems to have been able to collaborate with all groups with ease and values each particular club for its specific merits. As Shee says, “I grew up doing all different styles, and that prior experience lets me do all these different things on campus. I’ve really enjoyed working with HBC, which is much more technically focused, as well as the AADT, which has a really different mentality and a great sense of community, but attracts a very different crowd.” The students who break this boundary are few, he says.
A Molecular and Cellular Biology concentrator, Shee has plans to work in cancer research at the Broad Institute in Cambridge upon graduation. It seems that even there he will be able to bring his characteristic versatility and artistic abilities to the realm of scientific investigation. “There is actually a lot of crossover between the research I’ll be doing and my work as a dancer. I find that both are in their own way modes of creativity and innovation—ways of exploring new possibilities—a theme that seems to come out in everything I want to do.” Shee also says he plans on continuing to take dance classes at the Harvard Dance Center and in Boston, and possibly even perform as a guest artist with Harvard dance groups in the future. “Dance at Harvard holds a special place in my life, and I am looking forward to seeing it grow even after I graduate ... the program has really drawn out my love and passion for dance—it defines me.” Indeed, though dance is integral to Shee’s identity, his superb versatility and artistic style remain adaptable.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Many seniors leave Harvard with aspirations to enter the professional field upon graduation, but how many of them can say that they have been a ‘professional’ before their freshman year of college? Meet Elizabeth “Liz” C. Walker ’11, one of the most prominent ballet dancers in Harvard’s dance scene and co-recipient of the Office for the Arts Suzanne Farrell Dance Prize.
Recounting her gap-year experience, Walker says, “In my senior year of high school, I auditioned for companies across the country, and [Los Angeles Ballet] is where I got an offer. When I was in high school I was intensively training and really wanted to join a company, and maybe do school part time. But then I was accepted [to Harvard College] and I was conflicted. I knew Harvard let you take one year off, which was great, [but] by the end, I really wanted to just continue dancing full-time.”
So what pulled Walker to leave Los Angeles for Cambridge? “I knew I could not give up the chance to come here [but] ... wanted to go somewhere where I could study something other than dance, and meet different types of people still dancing at a high level. Harvard is one of the best places for classical and contemporary ballet [in academia]. I was thinking of coming here for one year and going back to dancing—because dance years are precious. But I was injured and ended up staying for two and a half years. I’m so glad I did because I had so much more of a real experience here.”
Walker’s peers are also grateful for the time and energy that she has invested during her four years at Harvard. “Liz is perhaps one of the fiercest dancers I know—she’s incredibly technical and beautiful when it comes to classical ballet, but also is stunning in more contemporary works,” says Hazel A. Lever ’13, the current president of the Harvard Ballet Company (HBC).
Kevin Shee ’11, co-recipient of the Office of the Arts Suzanne Farrell Dance Prize alongside Walker, only had praise to offer: “On a technical level, she’s easily one of the best dancers that Harvard has ever had. As a partner, she’s always been a pleasure to work with, giving me feedback and making adjustments as necessary to help things run more smoothly. As a friend and person, she breathes life into whatever space she enters, especially in the studio during the long hours of rehearsal or class with her random hilarious dance moves and one-liners.”
A History of Art and Architecture concentrator, Walker has not only graced Harvard’s finest stages. but she has made a lasting impression on her mentors and professors. According to former Dance Director Elizabeth Bergmann, “[Walker] has graced the stages of Harvard with her extraordinary long legs and elegant line. Her interpretations of her roles has been exquisite—from dancing “The Bride” in Martha Graham’s “Appalachian Spring” to her contributions in Claudia Schreier’s [student] choreography. [She] brings the level of performance to new heights through her professionalism and her enormous talent,” she wrote in an emailed statement.
Deborah Foster, Head Tutor and Senior Lecturer in Folklore and Mythology, who has taught Walker in class, calls herself “a huge fan” of her dancing. “ Her presence on stage is captivating; I could never take my eyes off her. I have no doubt that Liz will pursue a career in dance—she seems to be one of those individuals who simply must dance. Not only is she a talented performer, but she is also highly intelligent, utterly thoughtful, and enormously kind.”
Despite this praise, Walker remains humble and holds her peers in high regard. “The Harvard dance program has provided some really great opportunities, [and] the Harvard Ballet Company is student-run, so we take a lot more ownership over the final product, each performance that we do. I had the chance from sophomore spring to junior fall to direct HBC [and] learned about everything that goes into a performance and each planning stage.”
As graduation draws near, Walker plans to return to the professional world that she entered years ago. “I just got a contract to go back to L.A., where I will be starting in October,” said Walker.
Of the things she will miss the most at Harvard, Walker says, “I will miss all of my friends the most. I will miss waking up every day and being in this amazing place—the dance studios, art museums, libraries—it’s a little world and is such a unique thing to have ... I hope that dancers take advantage of as many opportunities as possible, and challenge themselves with different choreography.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some might say Benjamin J. Nelson ’11 harbors his vast creative energy in his flowing blond hair. The origins of Nelson’s indomitable spirit remain uncertain, but their effect is undeniable. The enthusiastic Nelson has been an active member of the campus theater and music scene in his time at Harvard; he has served in multiple positions as both a performer and organizer.
As a board member of the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert & Sullivan Players, Nelson has been in six consecutive productions. He has served as president and treasurer of the organization, and he produced a show in the fall. Joshua R. McTaggart ’13, a Crimson arts comper, wrote of Nelson in an email, “I’ve worked with Ben in a few capacities since last fall ... One word describes Ben: eccentricity. As a producer, [Nelson’s] enthusiasm for the arts helped make ‘Ruddigore’ an enjoyable project. His boundless energy, his funny quips, and his love of margaritas made the whole experience both fun and artistically successful.” Of Nelson’s acting, McTaggart shared, “Never before has someone given characters so much energy and excitement. As Von Eisenstein in ‘Die Fledermaus,’ he was a hysterical caricature of a brilliant cad—drunk, womanizing, and over the top.”
Perhaps Nelson’s most remarkable contribution to the arts at Harvard is his involvement with the Harvard Krokodiloes (Kroks). Nelson remembers seeing the Kroks for the first time during his prefrosh weekend: “They were so polished and so confident, and I wanted to be one of them,” he says. A few months later, Nelson’s was given a spot in the group. Now a senior, Nelson serves as music director. He had creative ideas for the development of the group, and succeeded in making these visions a tangible reality.
Members of the Krokodiloes are thankful for Nelson’s leadership and energy. Fellow Krokodiloe Jesse Wong ’12 says that “[Nelson] has shaped the ragtag and misbehaving group of cut-ups that we are into a respectable and reputable performing force on campus. He has a great sense of what makes up exciting programs and a great drive for getting things done.” Senior Kevin Chow ’11 echoed these positive sentiments in an email. “[Nelson] is, simply put, ambitious—ambitious beyond belief.” Nelson undertook the unprecedented challenge of making the Kroks learn a completely new repertoire in time for the 65th anniversary concert. Through an immense effort and outreach to old music directors, Nelson accomplished his goal. “Ben pulled it off. He heckled arrangers to finish arranging in time so that we would have enough time to learn the music, he ran tight rehearsals to make sure that we were efficient at learning the music, he was even tyrannical at times, and he demanded only the best from us. I think it goes without saying that all the Kroks have a great deal of respect for him for pulling this feat off. As a graduating senior, I am extremely happy and honored to have sung in the group that he led,” writes Chow.
Though Nelson’s talents do not stop at singing and acting—he’s served as a ringer in the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra and Bach Society Orchestra on trumpet and has directed musicals—he cites the Krokodiloes as the most influential part of his Harvard career. “The Kroks and [the Gilbert & Sullivan Players] have been the most formative activities, but the Kroks have dominated my experience the past couple of years … You see these people every day, and you even spend 10 weeks with the same guys every day over the summer. It is formative and takes over your life, but in an absolutely incredible way,” he says.
After Harvard, Nelson plans to continue his involvement in the arts. “I think I want to do something in the entertainment industry, or the production side of film. I don’t really have a definitive idea, but I have a lot of leads that I am following.” Though ambitious, his humility comes through most in his gratitude to Harvard. “I was not the same person that I am today when I first showed up on campus, and, I think, mostly for the better,” he says. He is thankful for the unique opportunities the College has afforded him.  “I’m from South Dakota, and before I came here I’d only been to Canada. And now I’ve been to 16 countries and sang at Carnegie Hall.”

If piano was the only instrument that David H. Miller ’11 had ever learned to play, countless performance groups and the Harvard music department would have missed out. In just four years at Harvard, Miller, a music concentrator, has worked as assistant conductor for the Harvard-Radcliffe Mozart Society Orchestra, served on the board of the Harvard Early Music Society, and played double bass in the Brattle Street Chamber Players, a dynamic 14-member string chamber orchestra. An integral member of the college music scene, he has ensured that his absence will be felt.
One of his first experiences with music, however, was not nearly as positive as one might expect. “I took piano lessons as a kid and hated it, which is very ironic to think about now,” Miller says. Only when he learned to play the double bass did his interest in music flourish and eventually develop into a dedication to the performance arts.
In addition to performing in a vast array of musical groups, Miller connects with music on an academic level as a music concentrator; naturally, he brings certain aspects of musical performance and training to academic coursework, and often finds himself inadvertently joining the two. “When I’m doing academic work, I approach it with a performer’s mindset, to a certain degree. That’s how I learned to interact with music: as a performer,” said Miller, who plans to continue with music after graduation by studying bass in Vienna next fall. “One of the amazing things about Harvard is that you have the opportunity to do such a wide breadth of activities. I would love to combine playing and academic work, which is something I’ve really enjoyed here.” Those who have had the pleasure of performing with him hold Miller in high regard: “David is an incredible musician, a really committed person and he’s the reason why Brattle [Street Chamber Players] is as good as it is these days,” said Charlotte S. Austin ’11, a viola player in the Brattle Street Chamber Players and a close friend of Miller’s. “As president, he took the group into his hands and transformed it, and [led us in] a tour to New York, which Brattle had never done before.”
Though the combination of academic work and playing outside of class is immensely enjoyable, Miller admits that it is, of course, a challenge to engage with music on such a immersive level both in and outside of schoolwork, but “academic study and performance have a very symbiotic relationship,” Miller notes. “They both do things that the other can’t. A piece of music really requires someone to perform it, and when you take [an academic approach] to music, you can delve deeper into the fabric of the music itself without having to worry about the practicalities and the technical aspects of performance.”
Miller maintains a yearlong relationship with music by traveling the world in summers between school years to pursue his passion for playing and conducting. He played bass in a music festival in North Carolina after freshman year, completed thesis research in Switzerland last summer, and studied conducting in Paris after sophomore year. “Those [experiences] have been really valuable in complementing what I do here,” says Miller of his summer activities. Though he has found inspiration over his summer abroad, his collaborations with other musicians at Harvard provide their own kind of inspiration. In nostalgic reflection on his time as an undergraduate at the College, Miller says that the extraordinary passion of those with whom he’s worked has helped motivate him as well. “It’s incredible how invested and committed people are to really achieving something at a very high level. In many ways that’s been the most affirming, inspiring thing that I’ve experienced here. It makes me feel like what I’m doing really matters if it matters so much to [so many] other people.”

April 29-April 30, 8:00pm
Sanders Theatre
Conducted by Andrew G. Clark
On April 29, the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra (HRO) will join the Holden Choirs in presenting a titanic program featuring Ludwig van Beethoven’s inspiring “Symphony No. 9” and the Boston premiere of the introspective “On the Transmigration of Souls” by John C. Adams ’71. These epic pieces require a Herculean effort to produce—both pieces are for chorus and orchestra and demand so many performers that extensions to the stage are required. “On the Transmigration of Souls” also calls for a children’s choir, which must perform on the Sanders Theatre balcony since no space remains for them on stage.
But the massive performing forces are not merely for show; the two featured pieces offer a taste of two disparate parts of the classical world: the intellectual romantic and the modern. There is nothing left unsaid about Beethoven’s superlative 9th Symphony; considered one of the greatest classical pieces of all time, it is described by Director of Choral Activities and concert conductor Andrew G. Clark as “an affirmation of humanity and the community.” Adams’s piece, although much newer, holds its own against Beethoven’s classic. It was commissioned by the New York Philharmonic as a tribute to the victims of the attacks of September 11, 2001, and since then has been awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Music and a Grammy Award. According to Clark, the piece is typical for Adams, who “tackles controversial and compelling material, whether it’s responding to September 11th or writing operas about Nixon’s visit to China—‘Nixon in China’—or the Manhattan project—‘Dr. Atomic’… and allows the audience member to see different events through different lenses.”
Adams, a Massachusetts native, will be in the audience to hear the Boston premiere of his work that HRO violinist Aviva I. Hakanoglu ’14 describes as “one of the most powerful and dynamic pieces I have ever played.” She adds, “we are playing a really powerful program”—a program that Clark describes as a contrast between the joyous and awe-inspiring Beethoven and the more restrained and timid Adams.
The program, one that would tire most professional orchestras, has been difficult to assemble, with Beethoven’s Ninth clocking in at an immense 70 minutes and “On the Transmigration of Souls” exemplifying the immensely complex style of contemporary classical music. However, HRO bassist Bran S. Shim ’14 is optimistic. “It’s been a very trying journey that has been worth it,” he says. “The audience is definitely going to be moved.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The College Board has received criticism after some versions of the March SAT Reasoning Test included an essay question about reality television.  The essay prompt asked , “How authentic can these shows be when producers design challenges for the participants and then editors alter filmed scenes?  Do people benefit from forms of entertainment that show so-called reality, or are such forms of entertainment harmful?”  Many students objected to it, claiming that even hardworking, well-read students were at a disadvantage to those who watched a lot of often-lowbrow TV.  Their complaints, however, lead one to wonder what exactly the SAT should test .
The SAT is designed to provide a simple, quantifiable number measuring a student’s verbal and quantitative skills. The test has long been criticized for giving advantages to upper-class students who have the time and money to receive “coaching” for the test.  It’s built a reputation for asking very similar questions each year, making preparation relatively easy and routine. Many successful SAT takers come into the test with a SparkNotes-level knowledge of a few books with broad themes that seemingly apply to any prompt (the role of man in society, alienation, innocence vs. experience—you get the idea).  Students then find some loose way to connect these ideas to the test prompt and regurgitate the commentary they’ve honed in numerous practice tests.  The reality TV question, at least, required something different: It forced students away from such book references, demanding they form an opinion on their world.
College is the time when students are supposed to “find their voice.”  When they arrive on campus, students are less expected to repeat memorized facts than to form original theories.  Asking a question that requires students to look at modern culture with a critical eye is exactly what the SAT should be testing.  If students have to rely on a few memorized concepts to formulate an argument, they shouldn’t do well.  While memorization should help, it shouldn’t guarantee success.
Those who claim that a student needs knowledge of specific television programs to answer a general question on reality TV miss the point.  Students who spent the essay giving an in-depth description of Jersey Shore would not get much credit. To do well, the student would need to make a cohesive argument about the effects of reality TV, rather than describing what happened on a program.  The description given in the prompt was more than enough to make such an argument.
The fact that the students arguing against this kind of prompt believe that meaningless details about specific television programs make a good essay demonstrates the main problem: Students approach these SAT prompts with the goal of packing in details to support an argument.  Students shouldn’t have to focus on extraneous details that don’t directly answer the question; the focus should be on developing an idea with personal insight.
There’s no doubt that the prompt was a difficult one that would put students out of their comfort zones of practice examples.  It’s not exactly fair that, after years of bland, mindless questions, the test designers suddenly asked for something entirely different.  Nevertheless, now that students have been warned, the SAT shouldn’t go back.  Topical and thought-provoking prompts are exactly what the College Board should be asking. Let’s not test how many opportunities they have for preparation; let’s test how they think.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Earlier this month, two Democrats—Pennsylvania’s Robert P. Casey, Jr. and Washington’s Patricia L. “Patty” Murray—introduced a provocative piece of legislation in the Senate. The Campus Sexual Violence Elimination Act, an expansion of the 1990 Jeanne Clery Act, would require colleges to include all incidents of sexual violence that occur on their campuses in their annual crime reports, to offer sexual-violence protection programs, to define consent in sexual relationships, and to assist victims of sexual assault in changing living arrangements. Ultimately, the new legislation would provide a much-needed expansion of the Clery Act’s nearly twenty-year-old definition of sexual assault and increased support for victims on campuses.
As of now, almost 20 advocacy groups have voiced their support for the Campus Sexual Violence Elimination Act, and we can only hope that it passes as quickly as possible. The frequency at which unrecorded incidents of sexual violence occur on campuses—even on our own—is deeply troubling, and universities like Harvard must be made to take stronger leads in fighting head-on such an epidemic. In our view, this new legislation would do exactly that: It would hold universities even more accountable for the safety of their own students and would work toward facilitating an appropriate environment on each campus.
This bill seems especially relevant given that the past year has shown us that even in the most seemingly progressive of intellectual environments, an atmosphere of sexual violence can still encroach on the culture of a university campus.
One of the things this past year has shown us is that even in the most seemingly progressive of intellectual environments, an atmosphere of sexual violence can still encroach on the culture of a university campus.  This past October, for instance, members of Yale’s Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity made national headlines when they marched around campus chanting offensive slogans such as “no means yes, yes means anal” and “I’m a necrophiliac, I fuck dead women.” As a result, 16 current and former Yale students have rightly reacted not only against the fraternity but also against the university itself. Earlier this year, they filed a formal complaint against their own institution, saying that Yale’s “inadequate response” to the incident only facilitated a “hostile sexual environment on campus” and clearly violated Title IX, the federal gender-equity law.
As these students understand, only university administrations can ultimately effect change within their campuses in the long term. In the meantime, before this legislation is passed, we can only urge our own administration to consider the dangers of its own campus environment and to behave as though the Campus Sexual Violence Elimination Act were already in place. Although there are already numerous initiatives such as Take Back the Night active on our campus, none would be as strong as an increased University-wide commitment to public accountability.
Whether or not Harvard men have chanted offensive things in the Yard, it would be still be nearly impossible to find a Harvard student who did not have at least one anecdote of seeing an act that could have been classified sexual violence. Even though an adoption of the Campus Sexual Violence Elimination Act carries with it a significant potential for embarrassment in terms of public disclosure, Harvard—and other universities—should embrace the new responsibility it brings and join the nationwide battle against sexual violence on college campuses that this new legislation represents.

I love my roommates, the four girls who sprinkle bits of joy into my day. Together, we are lovers of flowers, though we often forget to water them, fail to tend them, and let them wilt away and drop their petals on our bureaus. One of these beautiful roommates achieved enlightenment when she wisely decided to forgo the roses and Gerber daisies in exchange for a tiny cactus that promised life at the expense of beauty. Constantly strategizing on how to cheaply transform our rooms into greenhouses, we pilfer flowers left behind after fancy dining hall dinners, and we willingly accept the bouquets offered to us during our last senior events.
As April rains turn into May blossoms, I remember why I water the faithful Hyacinth and Kalanchoe sitting on my desk instead of checking my email, even when my email-checking so often trumps other tasks. Flowers are little celebrations of life. And though a single white rose is dying slowly beside me in a vase as I type this, I cannot throw it away or rush its natural passing. It is a symbol of celebration, which is a reminder of how much I am blessed.
Long before my college roommates entered my life, my mom showed me the beauty of celebrating life and wonder and beauty through the gifts of God and nature. My mom is a gardener, tried and true, gloves and trowel, and she taught my sisters and me how to plant tulip bulbs. She painstakingly drew up chore charts assigning each of my sisters separate plots of the yard to weed, water, and plant. Even when we ignored the chore charts, and we usually did, we couldn’t escape gardening. Never quite mastering authoritarianism, my mom didn’t believe in grounding us; she believed in weeding. Whenever we fought too much or complained too long, my sisters and I were punished by being pushed out the door and into the flowerbeds. We knelt in the dirt and carelessly weeded, petitioning my mom to forgive us and let us give up and go play. But secretly, as far as punishments go, we didn’t mind too much hanging out in the yard and watching the flowers grow.
In my family, Easter is the culmination of early spring gardening. Our yard blooms purple, yellow, orange, and pink as the children—and teenagers, and occasionally adults—from church hunt for Easter eggs in search of candy. The Easter egg hunt is a timeless, sugar-filled, and competitively cutthroat tradition, but it is only a trivial celebration within a glorious celebration. It is a light blessing within the magnificent blessing that is the Resurrection of Christ the King. To Christians, Easter is the celebration of the gift of life blessed with freedom and grace.
Above all, I think, it is the strangest story ever told: A man who said he was God sacrificing himself on a wooden cross for the sinful creatures of the earth, and passing from death to life, from grave to earth.
“He is Risen,” my dad greeted me before early Easter sunrise services year after year. “He is Risen Indeed!” I responded. This then, is the spirit of Easter for Christians—life made anew before the cross in the dawning of spring.
At Harvard, Christians celebrate Easter alongside our friends celebrating Passover, the commemoration of the Exodus and freedom from slavery. Like the Resurrection, Passover celebrates a divine rescue into freedom. Side by side, Christians and Jews celebrate new life and the greatest blessing—a  God who loves, and a God who keeps his promises to his children.
This week is a communion of two religious worlds. It is a rare moment when we can seek truth together, in the same God, at the same time, on the same campus. Furthermore, this week is a retreat into remembrance, and a call for renewal. We find that we are not unlovable, but we are undeserving of such great love. We live, but this life is a gift. We are children of God, but we owe our lives—this eternal childhood—to the God who paid our debt.
In the season of Holy Week, and the season of Passover, we ponder our greatest blessings and celebrate the triumph over death, sin, and wandering in pursuit of our God. Revelation, the last book of the Bible, decrees that in the last days, believers will sing the “song of Moses the servant of God and the song of the Lamb.” But, even now, our voices can together be raised in praise, in celebration, and in awe of this gift that is life.

There are two ways to address the mid-term to long-term fiscal deficit. One way, which Paul Ryan and the Republican presidential candidates prefer, is to eliminate every dollar that we spend to invest in our country’s future and support the poor and middle class. Yet if we are a society that believes in taking care of the poor and elderly and investing in our future, there are numerous fair, humane, and sensible opportunities to cut spending and raise revenues that don’t involve cutting programs that are essential to our nation’s well-being. A recently released plan called“Our Fiscal Security,” crafted by the Economic Policy Institute, Demos, and The Century Foundation, has a variety of ideas that allow us to plug the long-term fiscal deficit with sensible and fair measures.
One very quick way to get our long-term deficit under control is to let the Bush Tax Cuts expire, which would increase revenues by $3.3 trillion over the next ten years. These savings would immediately decrease our deficit to a sustainable level. President Obama does not plan to renew the tax cuts for the top two percent of earners, but even the middle-class and lower-income tax cuts are heavily slanted towards the wealthy, and the vast majority of Americans would see a only a small change in their tax bills if rates changed back to Clinton levels.
The Bush tax cuts are far from the only regressive and wasteful measures in our tax code. Capital gains and dividends are currently taxed at 15 percent, a regressive measure which allows the financial sector to grow larger than necessary and allows the rich to pay lower tax rates than everyone else. These should be taxed as ordinary income, a measure that would bring in $917.6 billion over a decade. Returning the estate tax to Clinton-era levels, making the mortgage-interest deduction more progressive, implementing a millionaire’s tax, and eliminating the payroll tax cap are all additional and sensible measures we can take to bring in needed revenue.
On the spending side, as we face a future of limited resources, we can significantly cut back on unnecessary expenses while still maintaining a strong military. The bipartisan Sustainable Defense Task Force has found $960 billion in savings over the next 10 years through small but sensible downsizing of our nuclear arsenal, European and Asian bases, and weapons systems, as well as consolidation of overlapping organizational structures, brigades, and combat teams. We’d still far and away be the strongest military in the world with a downsized force of 230 Navy battle ships, 1,000 nuclear weapons, 65,000 troops in Asia, and 23 Marine Corps infantry battalions, to name some of the task force’s specific targets.
Because healthcare costs are rising at a rapid rate, Medicare and Medicaid costs are another sizable driver of the long-term deficit. Republicans realize this and plan to decrease government expenses by shifting the responsibility for payment to poor and senior consumers, instead of fighting the sources of rising costs. In the Affordable Care Act, Democrats take multiple positive steps towards controlling healthcare costs, including a surcharge on expensive health insurance plans and an Independent Payment Advisory Board to help control payments to doctors and hospitals.  The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill will save $143 billion over ten years, and President Obama has proposed strengthening these cost controls to save up to $290 billion more in the next decade. The reform bill’s savings will be much larger in reform’s second decade, and Harvard professor David M. Cutler '87 has estimated that many of our test and pilot projects to control costs might bring savings much larger than CBO estimates.
As we look towards industries of the future and fighting climate change, carbon and gasoline taxes are deficit-cutting measures that should bring together deficit hawks and environmentalists. A sensible carbon tax where half the allowances would be repaid to poor and middle-class consumers could still raise $52 billion for the government over the next decade, while increasing the gas tax by 25 cents a gallon could raise $305 billion over the next decade. These measures would create major incentives for investment in the clean energy industry while having a significant impact on emissions and individual behavior.
The deficit debate is all too often framed by conservatives as a situation  in which we have no choice but to cut services to the poor, sick, and elderly. Yet we always have a choice when it comes to our budget, and this plan gives us an opportunity to implement a more fair taxation system while setting sound policy and preserving the social safety net. Paul Ryan and the Republican presidential candidates have made the deficit debate one about our values, and it’s time for progressives to put forth proposals that are intelligent and fair.

A two-day interdisciplinary conference that examined the changing experiences of soldiers in modern society was hosted by the Humanities Center last weekend.
Titled “Soldiering: The Afterlife of a Modern Experience,” the event was intended to “examine the gradual disintegration of the Soldier-Subject in the postwar period and the ‘afterlife’ forms of modern soldiering,” according to the conference website.
Topics included the role of new military technology, the formation of postwar national identities, and the distinction between soldiers, civilians, and the state, and featured speakers from a variety of Harvard humanities departments, as well as from universities across the country.
Oded Na’aman, a graduate student and one of the conference organizers, said he was excited about the interdisciplinary nature of the event.
“People are working in different disciplines, but they have the same kind of concerns,” he said.
Conference attendee Winston A. Gee ’13 agreed, citing the panel on the representation of soldiers in poetry and literature as an example of an interesting and unique perspective on the topic.
The conference also featured a screening of the film “Human Terrain: War Becomes Academic,” followed by a discussion with the film’s director, James Der Derian of Brown University.
“The movie was made about the interaction between the army and academia, and we thought that it could attract people who were more interested in the political, rather than the academic, aspect of the conference,” Na’aman said.
The event was one of the Humanities Center’s annual graduate student conferences, the topic of which ws selected through an application process.
This year, the accepted proposal was submitted by Na’aman and fellow graduate students Tal Arbel, Melissa Lo, and Sabrina A. Peric.
Gee, who heard about the conference from his Social Studies tutorial leader Arbel, said he enjoyed the discourse about the increasing technological aspect of soldiering.
“The conference meshes very well with my interest in social theory and also gives a more comprehensive look at what it’s like to be a soldier,” Gee said.

Approximately 20 students from the Harvard chapter of the Students for a Just and Stable Future (SJSF), a student collective that campaigns against the threat of global warming, hosted an Earth Day lobbying event on Friday to further the standing of two bills that the organization drafted and proposed to the Massachusetts legislature earlier this year.
Each Friday since the beginning of the spring semester, representatives from SJSF have been visiting the State House to meet with legislators in an attempt to advance the organization’s causes, which are outlined in two separate bills. One bill calls for the phasing out of coal use in Massachusetts by 2015. The other bill calls for the creation of a task force that would develop a plan for generating solely clean electricity in the state by 2020.
In honor of Earth Day, the Harvard chapter of SJSF, along with several students from Wheaton College, Brandeis University, the University of Vermont, and Worcester Polytechnic Institute—the four other universities represented in the volunteer collective—decided to make a concerted effort to advance the status of the bills within the House on Friday.
“A lot of the students who made it this Friday were actual Massachusetts residents [unlike most Harvard students], so when we were talking to their senators or representatives, it made a difference because they were their actual constituents,” said Serena Y. Zhao ’12, the SJSF Harvard chapter organizational level coordinator. “[Earth Day] was also a nice time because it is a time when people are thinking of their effects on the environment. It was just a way to get people excited.”
Although the Undergraduate Council voted against a bill earlier this month supporting SJSF’s Earth Day lobbying event, the number of Harvard students present was sufficient to accomplish the organization’s goals for the day, according to John E. Beatty ’11, a founder of the Harvard chapter.
“We had a lot of success,” Beatty said. “This is a very important cause for the Harvard branch. We have a lot of co-sponsors in the State House, most of them representatives, and we’re just hoping this will help build more momentum for the bills.”
Because Earth Day also coincided with Good Friday, much of the State House staff was absent, and students were only able to meet with a total of 15 legislative aides. However, students left packets of materials including copies of the bills, formal letters to committee chairs, and letters of support from constituents in the offices of seven legislators specifically targeted by the group.
Members of the SJSF said they hope the bills earn a hearing in the House as early as this fall.

Clare M. Gillis, a recent Harvard graduate who was reporting on the Libyan civil war, was finally allowed to call home last Thursday, marking her first contact with the outside world more than two weeks after being captured in Libya.
“She said they were treating her very well. She had what she described as pink pajamas,” said Jane Gillis, her mother, in an interview with The Crimson.
Clare Gillis’ parents received the phone call at around 1:00 p.m. Eastern time, when they were in the office of the Atlantic Magazine in Washington, D.C. In the 20-minute conversation, Clare Gillis told them that she had been moved to a women’s civilian jail in Tripoli and had remained there since April 19.
“None of the women spoke English, and [Clare’s] Arabic is very, very basic,” said Jane Gillis. “[But] they were combing each other’s hair. They were doing wash together. They were basically interacting.”
Clare Gillis’ father, Robert Gillis, said that they cannot predict when their daughter would be released, as they are unaware of the specific steps that are being taken by the State Department and the Turkish government, which have been working together to ensure her release and that of another captured journalist James Foley.
The Turkish ambassador to Libya has been trying to secure a visit to journalists that are being held by the Libyan authorities, according to Jane Gillis.
“The phone call was the first step,” she added. “We hope that Clare will be seen shortly and then [the journalists] will be released.”
She said she hopes that Harvard can make use of its alumni network to help expedite the release of her daughter, who spent 10 years at Harvard as a graduate student, a history adviser at Adams House, and teaching fellow for nine undergraduate courses.
“If there’s anyone who is connected with Harvard [that] has business with the Libyan government right now, I would encourage them to encourage the Libyan government to release Clare and all of the others,” she said.
Before she was captured on April 5, Claire Gillis was covering the civil conflict in Libya as a freelance reporter for the Atlantic and USA Today.
According to her parents, she was “in her element” in Libya, working 12 to 14 hours a day.
“She is interested in the dynamics of struggle and wants to report...what people were willing to do to invest in the efforts to make a better life for themselves and for others,” said Robert Gillis.
In a press conference in Washington last Thursday, Secretary of State Hillary R. Clinton called for the immediate release of “Americans who are being unjustly detained by Libyan authorities, including at least two reporters,” in reference to Clare Gillis and Foley.
Foley was also allowed to call home last Friday, telling his family that he was not injured and was well treated at a detention center in Tripoli, where Clare Gillis previously stayed.
According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, 80 attacks on journalists have been documented since the beginning of the conflict in Libya. These attacks include 49 detentions, 11 assaults, at least three serious injuries, and four fatalities.
Among the deaths were two award-winning photojournalists Tim Hetherington and Chris Hondros, who were killed in Libya last week.

The Undergraduate Council passed legislation creating stricter guidelines for endorsing student movements at its general meeting last night.
The legislation was created to address the Council’s lack of formal guidelines for granting or denying endorsement to student movements, according to the legislation.
The bill limits political endorsements the UC can make to ones solely involved with University policy and requires those seeking UC support to provide more information about the initiative.
“This specific act was in immediate response to problems that arose in endorsing the Cage Free Eggs movement,” said Jimmy P. Biblarz ’14, co-sponsor of the act. “But we’ve been dealing with this lack of consistency with the UC endorsement thing since Marty Peretz.”
Last fall, student backlash against the establishment of a fund in honor of Martin “Marty” H. Peretz—who attracted criticism for making inflammatory comments about Muslims in a blog post—led the Council to pass legislation condemning the University’s decision.
Due to the inconsistency in procedure, the co-sponsors of the act agreed that too much time was wasted deliberating whether it was the UC’s place to be endorsing specific student initiatives and, consequently, taking away from more important discussions concerning upcoming projects and other business.
“The strength of this legislation is that it provides a clear definition of what can even be considered,” said Danny P. Bicknell ’13, co-sponsor of the act.
Biblarz agreed, saying that this legislation is important because it “codifies” what the UC can endorse.
“It doesn’t mean we have to endorse it,” he said. “But this identifies that it is our right.”
Some UC members voiced concerns that student organizations would be “turned off” by these new procedures, which could be construed as further complicating the endorsement process.
The co-sponsors said they already anticipated this potential deterrent and intend to offer the assistance of a UC representative to “shepherd” student groups through the endorsement process.
“We want to welcome student groups in,” said UC President Senan Ebrahim ’12. “We don’t want this to be presented as more hurdles for students to jump through in order to be endorsed.”
According to the co-sponsors, the requirements should not be viewed as obstacles, as the legislation is largely intended to set clearer standards and make the process more objective and smooth.
“One of the problems we had with a lot of student groups was that they didn’t know what they wanted or what they wanted to get out of the UC,” Biblarz said. “Any legitimate organization should have this identified for themselves, and we are just requiring that they have it written for us as well.”

Standing behind a microphone in Science Center D, Daily Guerrero ’14 delivered a spoken word poem in the style of a hip-hop artist, but rather than taking on many of the themes common to hip-hop, she used the piece to “expose the ugly truth of female sexual objectification and its effects.”
“You are joining the ranks of men that can’t transcend because the physical is all they can comprehend,” she rapped on stage.
Guerrero won first place and $200 in the Black Community and Student Theater (BlackC.A.S.T.) second annual Poetry Slam, which attracted about 50 students on Friday.
The event was organized to bring together a variety of students from across campus who create poetry, rap, or spoken verse.
“Last year we had a really great show, so we decided to make it an annual event,” said Odelia S. Younge ’11, co-president of BlackC.A.S.T. “We wanted to do the event again because there is a big poetry contingent on campus we can cater for.”
This year, 10 performers all competed for the grand prize of $200. BlackC.A.S.T. hoped the event would give a platform to aspiring poets and performers in the Harvard community, with expert judges providing constructive criticism.
“The judges are looking for stage presence, content, and delivery,” said Younge, who said she hoped the event provided a comfortable and positive environment for the students.
Phrases like “Keep it raw, keep it real” and “I do not follow dreams/I lead them,” written on the chalkboard behind performers, were echoed in the self-written works of the students.
Lauren Faye, a high school student who was visiting Harvard, said she found the performances extremely moving.
“It is incredible to see the student’s personal experiences coming out in their poetry,” Faye said, “and the emotions they portray were really genuine.”
The judges said they had a difficult time selecting a winner, but after nine performances, the unanimous decision was to award the prize to Guerrero.
In her performance, Guerrero attempted to turn hip-hop’s negative influence on its head.
Entitled “The Woman Degraded,” Guerrero’s performance was based on a close friend telling her that he was looking for a relationship with no commitment, where he could treat the woman as an object.
Speaking after the event, Guerrero said, “I love poetry because it allows people to turn pain into power, weaknesses into strengths, fear into courage. Spoken word poetry especially draws its power from being raw and real.”
Guerrero said winning was not her motivation for entering the competition.
“Winning the slam just makes me feel really happy to have received recognition for something that I love to do.”

Harvard announced that it will sponsor five bike stations in Allston and Longwood as part of Boston’s “Hubway” bike sharing program, which officials said will launch this summer.
Hubway, unveiled last week by Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino, will allow users to rent bikes at 61 stations scattered around the Boston metropolitan area.
Riders must first sign up for memberships on kiosk touch screens, and prices will likely range from about $5 per day to $85 a year. Trips shorter than 30 minutes are expected to be free.
Harvard’s support of Hubway is the latest example of the University’s encouragement of biking in the area.
In 2009, Harvard and Boston collaborated on the completion of bike lanes on North Harvard Street. The University worked with the city last year to stripe bike lanes and install a cycle track on Western Avenue in Allston.
Cambridge also recently installed three free bike maintenance stands around the city.
Planning for Hubway began in 2008 and is a collaborative project between the Metropolitan Area Planning Council, the Federal Transit Administration, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, and the Massachusetts Department of Transportation.
“Over the past four years we have taken great strides toward making Boston a city that welcomes and encourages bicycling, but this innovative bike share system may be the most significant step yet,” Menino said in a press release.
“It’s a completely new part of our transportation network, giving people a green and healthy way to get around,” said Marc Draisen, the executive director of the Metropolitan Area Planning Council, in the press release.
Hubway currently has 11 sponsors, including Harvard, Northeastern, Children’s Hospital Boston, and New Balance.
Cambridge officials said the city is hoping to join the regional bike sharing program this fall or early next year. Harvard has also agreed to sponsor four bike share stations in Cambridge when the program expands.

A team of researchers from Harvard and the Broad Institute at MIT identified 11 genes that are implicated in the malaria parasite’s notorious ability to rapidly evade drug treatments—a discovery that could revolutionize malaria treatment.
For the study, the team used gene-hunting technology to search the genetic code of 57 different parasites from three different countries.
They found 11 genes that aid in drug resistance—one of which was previously confirmed and 10 that were discovered for the first time. A parasite that was still vulnerable to drugs became much more resistant to treatment when it was injected with PF10_0355, one of the newly discovered drug resistant genes.
This suggests that the gene may play a crucial role in building drug resistance among parasites, said Daria N. Van Tyne, one of the study’s authors from the Harvard School of Public Health.
“We feel that this is one gene of potentially many that affect drug-resistance mechanisms,” Van Tyne said. “We’re now working to follow up and understand how these and the other genes identified work.”
Currently, malaria affects more than 240 million people around the globe and kills 850,000 every year, especially in Africa, Asia, and South America. Reducing the toll of malaria is a major challenge because of the parasite’s talent for swiftly developing resistance to multiple drugs.
By identifying the mutations associated with drug resistance, scientists can better understand how parasites evade the drug, according to Sarah K. Volkman, senior research scientist at the Harvard School of Public Health’s Department of Immunology and Infectious Diseases.
“Once we understand the processes used by the parasite to avoid the effects of the antimalarial treatment, scientists can develop new drugs that circumvent the strategies employed by the drug-resistant malaria parasite,” Volkman said.
With the success of their work—which took over two and a half years to complete—the scientists plan on continuing their collaboration. They are currently investigating ways to develop a surveillance system that will contain a battery of genetic markers that tag resistance to different drugs.
“If a patient came in, they could look at the genetic code of the parasites and determine which drugs would be most effective in treatment,” Assistant Professor of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology Pardis C. Sabeti said. “It was not surprising that we found the existence of malarial-resistant genes. What was surprising was that we found them all within such a small sample of only 57 parasites.”
Much of the discovery was attributed to the technology used. The scientists used a genome-wide association study to look at the entire sequence of the parasite’s genome. Sabeti, who contributed to the computational genetics component of the collaboration, said that this technology allowed the researchers to analyze every single nucleotide of the sequence—24 million in total.
This application of genetic manipulation has rarely been applied to parasitic research.
Professor Dyann F. Wirth, director of the Harvard Malaria Initiative at the Harvard School of Public Health, said that most people who study genomes do not come from a microbiology background.
“It takes a while for them to adjust to changes in the way they think about the world,” Wirth said.

From secret courts to choreography, activism to AIDS, Sever Hall 113 was abuzz Friday evening with discussions of gender, sexuality, and culture at the Harvard College Women’s Center and Harvard College Queer Students and Allies’ second annual Undergraduate Gender Research Colloquium.
While the five presenters hailed from departments across the social sciences—History and Science, Folklore and Mythology, History, Social Studies, and Women, Gender and Sexuality were all represented—the original research they had done converged around the theme of gender and sexuality.
The interdisciplinary nature of the colloquium was exemplified by work such as that of Julia T. Havard ’11, who incorporated a choreography component into her History and Science thesis on “movement constraints, codes, and violations in the shaping of the female body through physical education and aesthetic movement in Victorian America.”
Brandon T. Perkovich ’11 spoke to the value of combining the study of medicine and culture in his History and Science research on the role of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, an organization that calls attention to gender issues, in the invention of safe sex in the gay community of San Francisco in the 1980s.
“Within the context of a History and Science thesis you’re allowed to ask questions like ‘Is it such that condoms had to be something that were used to prevent AIDS, or is there an alternative? And if there is an alternative, why isn’t that alternative being used?’” Perkovich said.
History concentrator Tony R. Meyer ’11 delved into the history of queer youth at Harvard. Likening Perkins Hall 28, the preferred hangout of a tight-knit group of gay men on campus, to a “queer fraternity,” Meyer explored the development of notions of sexual vocabulary, categories, and culture in the local queer community in the shadow of the Secret Court of 1920, an attempt by University officials to out and expel gay members of the Harvard community.
Other presenters revealed a personal side to their work.
Molly E. Moses ’11 illustrated the research paper she wrote for Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding 26: “Gender and Performance” by showing her own tallith, a fringed shawl traditionally worn by Jewish men at prayer which had controversially begun to be adopted by women.
Tara D. Venkatraman ’11 said she was inspired by her own experiences observing gender dynamics in leadership development, social justice, and classroom settings to explore her topic “Coming to Voice as a Young Urban Female Leader.” Taking a six-week hiatus from her thesis last fall, she said she felt similar challenges as those of the women she interviewed.
“My thesis journey mirrored pretty exactly some of the struggles that I think young women often go through in terms of expressing their opinions and speaking with the voice of authority,” she said.
But ultimately, she said, her return to her thesis was worthwhile because it allowed her to give voice to “young women who wouldn’t have normally been studied in an academic context or wouldn’t normally have had their voices validated as texts, as sources of knowledge.

The United States may have the strongest military in the world, but it had better hope that its next war doesn’t come down to an eights race. Or at least, not one against Harvard.
The U.S. Naval Academy was twice thwarted this weekend by the Crimson—once by the heavyweights on the Schuylkill and once by the lightweights on the Charles.
But true to form, the Midshipmen made Harvard fight for victories in several races and stole two from the Crimson lightweights.
“They’re just pretty tough, aggressive guys,” said junior Mike DiSanto, seven seat of the heavyweight first varsity eight. “Those guys are great competitors. They go out, and they go hard every single time we race them.”
NO. 2 LIGHTWEIGHTS vs. NO. 6 NAVY LIGHTWEIGHTS
Races can be won at any stage, so Harvard’s first varsity eight refused to wait, using a strong starting sequence to propel it to a narrow victory.
“We had a great start, which positioned us very well for the rest of the race,” said senior two-seat Jared Dourdeville. “Whenever Navy took a move, and they took a couple of very strong ones, we were able to counter.”
The Crimson finished in a time of 5:53.0, which was 1.2 seconds ahead of the Midshipmen’s 5:54.2. The margin was just enough to give Harvard the Haines Cup for the third year in a row.
The second varsity eight race told a similar story.
“In the 2V race, from what I heard, they had a good start as well,” Dourdeville said. “Navy took a strong move at the 1000 and took a couple seats back. The 2V was able to hold them off.”
The Crimson cruised to a 2.8 second win in the 2V race.
A hotly contested race turned into an easy victory for Harvard in the freshman eight event.
The Midshipmen had taken an early lead, but the Crimson’s 1F was able to regain control of the race and take a three-seat lead when one of Navy’s rowers caught a crab.
“That certainly influenced the final margin,” Dourdeville said.
But Harvard’s race still showcased the improvements the boat has made over the course of the season. The 1F began its season on a losing note but has since rallied to earn wins over strong teams such as Dartmouth and now the Midshipmen.
The Crimson’s two losses came in the third varsity eight race and the second freshman race.
Navy took the 3V race by 10 seconds and the 2F race by 5.6 seconds. It was the first time Harvard’s 3V had lost all season.
NO. 3 HEAVYWEIGHTS vs. NAVY HEAVYWEIGHTS, PENNSYLVANIA
A powerful start by Navy in the first varsity eight race threatened the end of Harvard’s boat-club-wide undefeated streak, but the Crimson’s third 500 put to rest any worry that the Midshipmen would blemish Harvard’s record.
Because the Schuylkill course has a turn in it, starts are staggered, and Navy started slightly back of the Crimson. But the Midshipmen quickly made up the distance to take a commanding early lead.
“They had seven seats up on us at one point,” DiSanto said.
But Harvard was unfazed by Navy’s lead.
“We kind of knew they were going to go out hard,” DiSanto said. “I think that was kind of their plan. I don’t think anyone in our boat was too nervous. We haven’t had [to come from that far behind] before. It was good to be put in that situation and come back. It was just the nine of us keeping faith in each other and having composure.”
The Crimson moved through the Midshipmen in the third 500 and ultimately won the race by 3.6 seconds to claim the Adams Cup for the 12th straight time.
While the first varsity eight race was a tight battle for most of the race, the rest of the events played out rather predictably. Harvard’s second varsity eight won by 8.7 seconds, its freshman eight won by 6.2 seconds, the third varsity eight won by 7.8 seconds, and the fourth varsity eight won by two seconds.
The Quakers were third in each event save for the 4V race in which they did not compete.
The Crimson has yet to lose a race in any event—including a race in which the 4V raced Princeton’s 3V and the 4V’s wins over several programs’ 1Vs in the team’s first weekend of competition.
“It’s a pretty amazing thing,” DiSanto said. “It’s just something that’s happened. We’re trying to keep it going for as long as possible. It’s really a testament to our coaching.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a story the Harvard men’s lacrosse team had witnessed before.
With 7:47 remaining in Saturday’s contest against Princeton (4-7, 2-3 Ivy), co-captain Dean Gibbons scored his third goal of the game, completing his sixth hat trick of the year and putting the Crimson (8-5, 2-3) up, 9-6.
But the Tigers responded under a minute later, when Alex Capretta scored for a third time of his own to cut the Harvard lead to two. At 6:31, Luke Armour beat Crimson sophomore goaltender Harry Krieger, and all of a sudden, Harvard was only up by one.
For three straight Ivy League contests coming into Saturday, the Crimson had lost a late lead and fallen by one goal, finding a more heart-wrenching manner in which to do so each time.
Those losses meant that Saturday was a game the squad had to win if it wanted to maintain any chance of making the Ivy League Tournament in two weeks—and earning the continuation of its season that comes with it.
It was then that Harvard decided the show which had defined its conference season up to this point would not have a fourth episode.
This time, the defense stepped up, and Krieger made a big save on a shot by Princeton midfielder Tyler Moni with 59 seconds remaining to give Harvard a much-needed victory.
“It was an incredible win for us,” senior attackman Matt Hull said. “Both teams came out, gave it their all. It kind of had the feel of a playoff game; it had that electricity before it because both teams knew what was at stake.”
It was the Tigers who jumped out to a quick lead. At 9:06, senior Chris McBride tallied the contest’s first score, and Capretta beat Krieger twice in a 90-second span to put Princeton up, 3-0.
But Harvard came roaring back with six unanswered goals. Gibbons put the Crimson on the board at 3:56 by firing one past Tigers goalie Tyler Fiorito, and Hull cut the Princeton lead to one a minute later.
“As a senior, the meaning of the game was even more paramount to me,” Hull said. “I said, ‘I’m going to leave it on the line,’ and my [fellow] senior Dean Gibbons had sort of the same mindset. We got really pumped for this game, and we were really focused.”
Harvard then shut out the Tigers in the second quarter while recording four tallies of its own. Gibbons tied the game at 13:26, and junior Jeff Cohen added his team-leading 26th score to put the Crimson ahead, 4-3, with 6:43 to go in the period.
Hull added his second goal a minute later, then finished the hat trick by beating Fiorito off a pass from Gibbons with just 1.4 seconds remaining in the half.
“There was a soft spot in the center of their defense,” Hull said. “Some of their defenders were very good on-ball but tended to get lost off-ball ... It was partially the game plan [to attack those areas]. I saw those openings and gaps and took advantage of them.”
Coming out of the half down 6-3, the Tigers got on the board when McBride beat Krieger at 11:03. But Harvard would respond quickly again, as sophomore Jack Doyle scored at 10:22, and junior co-captain Kevin Vaughan added a goal at 7:49. Both tallies came off passes by Gibbons, giving the senior a team-high 25 assists.
The Tigers came back with scores by Armour and Mike Grossman before the period came to an end, cutting the Harvard lead to 8-6 heading into the fourth. But the Crimson would hold off the Tigers in the final period, and emerge with wins over its conference rival in back-to-back years for the first time since 1987-88.
“It feels great,” Gibbons said. “Before the win last year, we hadn’t beaten Princeton for over 20 years. Now we’re trying to start a streak of our own.”
Fiorito finished with 16 saves to Krieger’s 15. The teams took an equal amount of shots in each of the first two quarters, but Princeton went on the attack in the second half and out-shot Harvard 27-12.
“Harry played great yesterday,” Gibbons said. “One of his best games of the season. Considering the talent they have, its quite an accomplishment for him to have the game he did.”
The victory gives Harvard the ability to control its own destiny to reach the Ivy League Tournament. With a win over Yale next weekend, the Crimson will earn the third seed, and the ability to avoid No. 3 Cornell in the first round of the four-team event in Ithaca, N.Y.
The Crimson was in the same situation last year—facing a win-and-in situation against the Bulldogs in the season finale—but missed the tournament after falling by one goal. As with Saturday’s contest, Harvard is determined not to let history repeat itself.
“It’s a lot about our mindset,” Hull said. “If we go out there as play as hard as we can, play our brand of lacrosse—fast-paced, up-beat—if we can do that, we’re confident we can pull it out and get into the Ivy League Tournament.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With 23:19 remaining in Saturday afternoon’s contest at Harvard Stadium, Columbia sophomore Kacie Johnson helped the second-to-last-place Lions take a 9-6 lead—their largest advantage of the game—over the Harvard women’s lacrosse team.
But just when it seemed as if Columbia (4-9, 1-5 Ivy) was poised to spoil the Crimson’s (9-4, 5-1 Ivy) chance of earning a share of the Ivy League title, sophomore Danielle Tetreault’s free position goal sparked an impressive 9-0 run for the home team, which would go on to win, 15-9.
“It’s just a game of momentum,” said junior tri-captain Melanie Baskind, who notched the go-ahead score for the Crimson off a free-position shot with 13:44 to play. “It’s just feeding off of each other’s energy.”
In the early going, it was the Lions who had the energy.
Columbia freshman Paige Cuscovitch scored the first two goals of the game, giving the visitors an early 2-0 lead. The Crimson and Lions traded the next four goals, putting Columbia ahead, 4-2, with 19:40 remaining in the first half.
Harvard and the Lions went on to play 15 minutes without scoring, with the Crimson missing plenty of opportunities—partly due to some big saves by Columbia junior goalie Karlee Blanke, who had 10 stops on the day.
The Lions finally scored with 4:01 left in the first half, giving Columbia its largest lead of the game.
But Harvard went on a short run to end the half. With 1:48 remaining, Harvard junior Jess Halpern faked out her defender and scored to cut the Crimson’s deficit to two.
With the clock winding down in the first half, the Crimson missed a desperation shot, but Baskind was able to bat the loose ball into the net with three seconds remaining, cutting the Lion’s lead to one going into halftime.
Harvard’s four goals marked its lowest first-half offensive output of the season.
“We were running our motion, and we weren’t clearing space for each other,” Crimson coach Lisa Miller said. “When we play against a packed-in defense, or a shell defense ... sometimes we just don’t give each other enough room, and our timing’s a little bit off, so we struggle to score against that.”
“I think we’re best when we move off ball, and we don’t get complacent,” Baskind added. “I think we just got to sharpen up and focus a little bit better next time.”
Harvard continued to struggle scoring the ball in the start of the second half.
Just 43 seconds into the frame, Johnson put the visitors back up by two, and the Crimson struggled at getting shots off of its free-position attempts.
But Baskind scored with 25:39 remaining to cut the deficit back to one. The Lions then went on to score the next two goals, giving Columbia an 8-5 lead with 23:29 left in the game.
But Harvard drew upon past experiences and did not panic.
“I think one of the beauties of playing a tough schedule is that you get used to playing in every different type of situation,” Baskind said. “I think we’ve been there before.”
With 21:50 left, Tetreault scored off of a free-position shot to cut the Lions’ lead to two. With 16:08 remaining, sophomore Jennifer VanderMeulen cut to the middle and scored off of an assist by Tetreault. One and a half minutes later, Tetreault scored on a fast break to knot the score at 8-all, the first tie of the game.
The scoring surge continued for the Crimson.
Less than a minute later, Baskind scored off a free-position shot to give Harvard its first lead of the game, and VanderMeulen scored the next two to put the Crimson up by three.
“We started to win the draw controls,” Miller said. “Draw controls in this game are everything.”
Three more goals by Halpern, Tetreault and VanderMeulen put Harvard up, 14-8, with 5:13 remaining, and helped seal the come-from-behind victory for the Crimson.
“We started to run some set pieces,” Miller said. “Then we can go back to our motion after we run that ... We’ll find a way to score one way or another.”
VanderMeulen led Harvard with five goals on the day, four of which came during the Crimson’s 9-0 run in the second half.
“She’s a goal scorer,” Miller said. “Goal scorers need to score or they get tight ... I think as soon as the first one fell, you could see her kind of loosen up a little bit.”
Halpern, Baskind and Tetreault each finished the day with three goals, while sophomore Nina Kucharczyk scored one.
Junior goalie Kerry Clark had five saves on the afternoon.
With Saturday’s win, Harvard can now clinch a share of the Ivy League title with a win at Dartmouth on Friday night.
“I think anyone who was watching it would say it was ugly, and it was,” Baskind said. “What’s important is that it’s another Ivy League win for us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Faced with choppy waters and gusty winds on a rainy morning, the Radcliffe lightweight and heavyweight crews took to the water to take on opponents both familiar and unfamiliar on the Charles River Saturday.
The lightweights squared off against Ivy foe Princeton and Bucknell in the Class of 1999 Cup, while the heavyweights rowed head to head against its historic rival Yale for the Case Cup.
NO. 4 RADCLIFFE LIGHTWEIGHTS VS. NO. 1 PRINCETON
Coming off a painful loss to Stanford last weekend, the Black and White lightweights were looking to regain momentum with victories over Princeton and Bucknell.
But Radcliffe’s expectations did not live up to its reality.
By the end of the competition on Saturday, the top-ranked Tigers (7-0) had bested the No. 4 Black and White, while the No. 6 Bison placed third in every race.
The first race of the day gave the Black and White an encouraging start to the day’s competition, as the Radcliffe second varsity eight powered past the Princeton 2V.
With the sound of the horn, the Black and White 2V came out strong and led Princeton by a comfortable margin at the halfway mark.
And in the second half of the race, the Black and White refused to relinquish its lead.
Instead, it extended its lead in the second 1000 meters of the course to cross the finish line in a time of 7:01.00, 12.7 seconds ahead of the Tigers.
But the Black and White varsity crew would not be able to match the success of its 2V counterpart.
In the varsity race, the Tiger crew got off the line very quickly and led throughout the race.
Although Radcliffe was able to match the speed of Princeton, and by the last 500-meter mark, even looked poised to make a final surge towards victory, the final surge never materialized, and the Tigers were able to hold off the Black and White to finish with a time of 6:42.6.
Radcliffe finished 7.1 seconds behind with a time of 6:49.7, while Bucknell placed third with a time of 7:03.1.
The loss gave the Radcliffe lightweights their second defeat of the season.
NO. 16 RADCLIFFE HEAVYWEIGHTS VS. NO. 8 YALE
After eight long years on the losing end of the racecourse, the Black and White (7-4) heavyweights defeated No. 8 and defending NCAA varsity champion Yale (6-3), to take the Case Cup and bragging rights between the two rival schools.
Radcliffe’s victory over Yale also marked its second straight victory against a top-10 opponent.
“Winning the Case Cup in the varsity eight and being competitive in all our boats this weekend was a really huge turning point for our team this season,” senior heavyweight rower Tara Larson said.
In the 1V race, the Bulldogs exploded off the line first and maintained a slight lead for the first 1000 meters of the race. But during the third 500 meters, the Black and White was able to move in on Yale and even things up.
Heading into the final 500 meters, both crews set off on powerful sprints towards the finish line, but Radcliffe’s furious pace was too much for the Bulldogs, and the Black and White surged ahead to grab a three-second victory over Yale.
Despite the success of the Radcliffe 1V, other Black and White crews struggled against the Bulldogs.
The Yale second varsity eight edged out Radcliffe by six tenths of a second, while the Black and White 3V, 4V and Varsity Four were all bested by stronger Bulldog crews.
Nevertheless, these losses were unable to diminish the victory of the Radcliffe 1V over Yale, as the Black and White celebrated their first Case Cup victory since 2003.
Radcliffe hopes to build off of this success in the remaining races of the season.
“The biggest influence that this weekend will have on the rest of our season is just the huge confidence booster this win against Yale has given us,” sophomore heavyweight rower Celia Kohl said. “Obviously we’ve had some ups and downs this season, but as a whole, we’ve always known that we had a fast boat but it’s taken some steps to get there.”
“Our team is really fired up because now we know for certain that the podium at the sprints championship is totally within our reach,” Larson said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After scoring just one run in two games against Yale on Friday, the Crimson’s offensive struggles continued in the third game of the series, as the Bulldogs (22-15, 10-6 Ivy) overpowered Harvard (9-31, 5-11) on the way to a commanding 8-1 victory yesterday afternoon. But Harvard came back to win the nightcap at O’Donnell Field for the second time this weekend, stunning Yale, 10-3, to earn its second win in four games against its rival.
“We started to bring some things together in that last game,” said senior pitcher Ben Sestanovich, who earned the win on the mound for Harvard. “We played some great defense and scored some runs. We pitched pretty decently and came out on top.”
HARVARD 10, YALE 3
In the top of the first, it looked like Yale might continue its dominant start to the day, as the Bulldogs earned the first run of the game.
But Harvard scored two in the bottom of the first, giving the Crimson a 2-1 lead it would not relinquish, with junior second baseman Jeff Reynolds and senior shortstop Sean O’Hara each notching an RBI.
“It was good to bounce back after a pretty pathetic first game,” Sestanovich said. “And it’s a lot better to go home on a victory than a loss.”
Senior centerfielder Dillon O’Neill led the team in scoring with three runs in yesterday’s nightcap, as hitting proved to be a key element to Harvard’s victory. Five Harvard players earned at least one RBI in the game, with Reynolds sending home three on two hits. Freshman third baseman Jake McGuiggan and O’Hara each contributed two RBI.
A highlight of the day came from McGuiggan, as the rookie slammed the ball beyond the right-field fence for a two-RBI home run in the fifth inning. The homer—McGuiggan’s first in his college career—opened up the game for the Crimson, pushing Harvard to a commanding 6-1 lead.
“McGuiggan’s home run really helped today,” Walsh said. “And it was good to see O’Hara, who’s been struggling at the plate, hit some line drives at the end there.”
In the sixth, Yale changed pitchers four times, as Bulldog pitchers sent co-captain Tyler Albright and sophomore first baseman Danny Moskovits home on a walk and a hit batsman, respectively, to put Harvard up, 8-1. A Yale fielding error allowed two more Harvard runs to score before the end of the inning, as the Crimson claimed a nine-run lead—its largest of the game.
“In the second game, we came out and, lo and behold, we swung the bats a little bit,” Walsh said. “But there was one inning there where we scored four runs without a hit. Even though we got 10 runs, [we couldn’t] really feel like the bats came alive.”
Yale scored two in the eighth, as senior infielder Trey Rallis hit one out of the park to bring the Bulldogs within seven. Luckily for the Crimson, no more Yale runs would score, as a short ninth inning ended on a double play.
Sestanovich—who recently underwent surgery for an elbow injury—had a strong night for Harvard, starting the game and striking out four batters in 5.1 innings.
“For me, the weekend was [all] Ben Sestanovich,” Walsh said. “You have to root for somebody like that. He went out there and had a really good outing.”
Harvard scored runs in double digits for the first time in seven games during yesterday’s nightcap.
“We’re hoping it’s contagious,” Walsh said. “We got a few hits and hope to carry that momentum into the week.”
YALE 8, HARVARD 1
In Sunday’s first game, Yale—which sits atop the Rolfe division in Ivy League standings—notched its second win against a Harvard team that has struggled for consistency so far this season.
Junior left-handed pitcher Brent Suter pitched the first four innings for the Crimson and struck out five batters, though he allowed seven runs scored in the first five innings.
“Suter’s been hot and cold for us all year,” Walsh said. “He didn’t have as good a fastball or breaking ball today [as he usually has] in the pen.”
Harvard went down by one in the second inning, but a Yale scoring surge in the fourth and fifth left the Crimson in an 8-1 hole.
“We have to learn to battle a little bit when we’re down early in the games,” Walsh said.
Harvard picked up its only run in the fourth, as Albright brought in junior designated hitter Marcus Way to bring Harvard within two of the Bulldogs, 3-1. Harvard earned just four hits in the loss.
With Harvard-Yale bragging rights on the line, this series has increased meaning for the Crimson.
"Everyone is familiar with the [Harvard-Yale] football rivalry,” McGuiggan said. “The baseball rivalry is just as big.”
“It was great that we were able to pull off the split,” Sestanovich added. “It would have been nice to win all four, but we’ll take it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
They say you can’t win a championship on the first day—but you can lose it.
This became all too apparent to the Harvard men’s golf team this past weekend at the Ivy League Championships at Galloway National Golf Club in Galloway, N.J.
Though the Crimson’s golfers were able to shoot well in the second and third round, Harvard’s first-round hole proved too deep to escape.
“It was a big disappointment,” junior Mark Pollak said.
Yale, whom the Crimson had beaten the weekend before, took the Ancient Eight championship, stopping Columbia’s run of three straight titles. The Lions, who took second, finished 20 strokes back.
Harvard’s team score of a 324 on Friday put it in seventh after the opening round. Only Cornell, which shot a 330, fared worse.
“We haven’t been a very consistent team, and that really showed true in the tournament,” junior captain Tony Grillo said.
Only Pollak went below 80 in the first round, as the junior shot a 79. Rookie Theo Lederhausen shot an 81, Grillo and freshman Seiji Liu each shot an 82, and rookie Michael Lai shot an 89.
The team had trouble responding to challenging weather in the opening round.
“The course was really difficult—we had some bad weather,” Pollak said. “But the course rewarded good play ... It was very fair.”
But the Crimson was able to pick up its play on Saturday, and actually had the second-best round of the league’s competitors that day.
Only Columbia was able to top Harvard’s combined score of 310. The Lions shot 307. Three Crimson players—Pollak, Lederhausen, and Liu—broke 80, with Pollak once again leading the way, this time with a 75.
But the second round wasn’t nearly strong enough to compensate for Harvard’s struggles in the first round, and after two days of play, the Crimson found itself tied for sixth place with Brown.
Meanwhile, Penn had surged to first place overall after turning in a combined 619, with the Bulldogs trailing by one stroke at 620.
With Princeton and the Lions tied for third with 626 apiece, the stage seemed to be set for a four-team showdown for the title.
That is, until Yale blew everyone out of the water in the third round with a 288 that allowed it to cruise to a 20-shot victory.
The Bulldogs’ team score was 14 shots better than the best round for any other team in the tournament.
Columbia’s 302 in the final round allowed the Lions to move past Penn for a second-place finish. The Quakers finished three strokes back to place third. Dartmouth was fourth, and the Tigers finished fifth.
“Yale played really excellently, and they are surely deserving of the victory,” Pollak said.
The Crimson tied with the Big Green for the third-best team performance on Sunday, but it was nowhere to be seen in the title hunt.
All Harvard’s third-round performance did was move the Crimson into sole possession of sixth place.
The Bears and the Big Red finished seventh and eight, respectively.
But while Harvard didn’t attain much success as a team, Pollak shot well enough to earn second-team All-Ivy honors.
“He was really the anchor of our team,” Grillo said. “He played the most consistent. If the rest of us played as consistently as he did, we probably would’ve won, but we didn’t play well.”
Like his team, Pollak found the most success in the second round. Sitting in 13th place after his first-round 79, the junior moved into a tie for sixth place.
But another 79 moved Pollak back into a tie for 11th place with Dartmouth’s Andrew Jankowski.
Lederhausen was the Crimson’s second-best finisher. The rookie, who took 13th, was just one shot shy of tying Pollak to join him on the second-team All Ivy roster.
The Crimson’s performance throughout the season gives it reason for optimism as it heads into the offseason.
Harvard graduates none of its athletes, and its performance at the Century Intercollegiate showed that the team could keep up with the league’s top golfers.
But while the future looks bright for the Crimson, Harvard once again ends its season a dark note.
Another year of play has left the Crimson still looking for the Ivy title that has eluded it since 1974.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Going into the last weekend of Ivy play, two things needed to happen for the No. 55 Harvard women’s tennis team to earn a five-way share of the Ivy League title: a win over No. 56 Dartmouth, and No. 50 Brown to defeat No. 34 Yale.
But the chance slipped away, with the Crimson (9-9, 4-3 Ivy) falling, 4-3, in a close match against the Big Green (14-8, 6-1) at the Murr Center on Saturday afternoon.
“It was a very exciting match that came down to the very last match in singles,” Harvard coach Traci Green said. “My hat goes out to Dartmouth for the way they competed and the way they played.”
The Crimson started off strong, claiming the doubles point with victories on the No. 1 and No. 2 courts.
The top pair of sophomores Hideko Tachibana and Kristin Norton finished first, toppling their opponents, 8-2, to give Harvard the edge in doubles play.
The No. 2 duo of junior co-captain Holly Cao and freshman Hannah Morrill followed, defeating Big Green seniors Ryan Reichel and Sabrina Stewart, 8-5, to secure the doubles point for the Crimson.
“The doubles point is the first point of the match, so it’s crucial that we get off to a good start,” Cao said. “But in the end, it’s only one point of the seven, so you still have to perform well in singles.”
On the No. 1 court, No. 79 Cao made quick work of Dartmouth senior Molly Scott to earn the singles win in straight sets, 6-2, 6-0.
But the Big Green took back the momentum to tie up the match, 2-2, as both Blosser and junior Samantha Gridley fell in straight sets to Reichel and sophomore Christina Danosi on the No. 4 and No. 6 courts, respectively.
Tachibana regained Harvard’s edge with a victory at the No. 2 spot against Dartmouth sophomore Sarah Leonard, posting a scores of 6-3, 6-2.
But with two matches still to play, it was anybody’s game.
On the No. 3 court, the Big Green stayed alive as freshman Melissa Matsuoka defeated Norton in a close match, 6-4, 6-4.
With the overall score now tied up at 3-3, all eyes were on court No. 5.
Morrill took the lead, winning the first set, 6-3, but Dartmouth senior Georgiana Smyser fought back to claim the second set, 6-3.
Both teams’ chance at the Ivy title would come down to the third and final set.
Morrill grabbed an early lead, up 2-1, but Smsyer regained momentum to take the final set, 6-3, to clinch the victory and a share of the title for her squad.
“As a freshman, Hannah has improved so much this season,” Cao said. “Even though she lost, she did a really great job and kept her composure, and we are proud of her.”
With the Bulldogs downing the Bears, 4-3, Yale and the Big Green tied for the top spot in the league. The Bulldog win also signified that the Crimson had no chance of sharing the title.
“Every single team in the Ivy League has been playing well,” Green said. “It speaks volumes about the league how there are so many ranked teams now, and any team can win on any given day. Overall, we have made a lot of progress internally this season…We are going to take every single win and every single loss and learn from it.”
“In singles, there were a lot of close matches that could have gone either way,” Cao said. “But when it came to the big points, Dartmouth did slightly better than us, and that’s what made the difference today. Overall though, as a team, we’ve done a better job of supporting each other and have made a lot of big strides throughout the season. We’ve done a good job and have a lot to be proud of.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
By taking on the Brutus Hamilton Invitational in Berkeley, Calif., and the Larry Ellis Invitational in Princeton, N.J., the Harvard track squad went coast-to-coast to bring back some school records, season records, and personal bests.
“I think we had a good weekend overall,” Crimson coach Jason Saretsky said. “I was most pleased with our sprinters and jumpers out in Cal and our middle distance runners and jumpers in Princeton.
“This week was more about continuing to work on individual performances, as we gear up for outdoor championships in two weeks.”
LARRY ELLIS INVITATIONAL
After strong performances against Yale in the annual Harvard-Yale dual meet, a contingent of Harvard runners and jumpers made its way down to Princeton this past Saturday to take on the rest of the Ancient Eight and the Northeast.
Clearing the bar at 1.65 meters, senior Dina Emde finished in a 10-way tie for third place in the high jump, behind second-place McKenzie Majchrzak of Army and first-place Monique Roberts of Columbia.
In the 1500-meter race, senior middle-distance runner Jamie Olson and freshman distance runner Morgan Kelly finished in second and third place, respectively. Olson finished in a time of 4:45.12, while Kelly finished a little under three seconds later in 4:48.09.
In the women’s 800-meter dash, freshman Alaina Murphy won her heat of the women’s 800-meter with a time of 2:13.24, while classmate and teammate Emma Lucken finished in third in her heat of the 800-meter with a time of 2:22.54.
On the men’s side of the 800-meter race, sophomore Weishen Mead ran away with first place in his heat in 1:53.52. With that time, Mead set not only a new season best for himself but also walked away with the third fastest time for the 800-meter event in the competition.
BRUTUS HAMILTON INVITATIONAL
On the other side of the country, another contingent of Crimson runners and jumpers was similarly making new records.
On the women’s side, freshmen Christina Twicken and Meisha Brooks and juniors Shannon Conway and Magdalena Robak won the 4x400 relay race in a time of 3:45.1.  Their mark was not only a best for the four runners but also the fifth-fastest time in Harvard history.
“They’ve just had a really strong year,” Saretsky said. “And it’s a similar time to what they ran during the indoor season at the ECACs. Its great to see them back to that form. It looks like they are hitting their stride as we head into the championship part of the season.”
Sophomore Sydnie Leroy posted a season-best mark in the women’s pole vault while taking sixth in the event. Leroy, who posted in a final height of 3.71 meters, came up just short in her attempt to topple the school record in pole vaulting.
In the 1500-meter race, senior Claire Richardson and junior Kailyn Kuzmuk finished in 10th and 11th place, respectively. Kuzmuk’s finishing time of 4:32.18 was a new personal best for the distance runner.
Clearing the bar at 1.68 meters, sophomore high-jumper Mary Hirst finished in fifth-place in the high jump but just 0.2 meters off her personal best of 1.70 meters. In the women’s 100-meter hurdles, freshman sprinter Olivia Abbate posted in a time of 14.97, to finish in seventh place overall for the event.
On the men’s side, junior Nico Weiler and sophomore Fedor Garin finished 2-3 in the pole vault, respectively, with Weiler clearing a height of 5.00m and Garin clearing 4.85m.
Back on the ground in the men’s 200-meter dash, junior sprinter John Dingus finished in third place with a time of 21.93, behind Utah State’s Armahd Lewis and Silas Pimentel.
Despite its victories so far this season, the Crimson hopes to continually build off of its success in its remaining races of the season.
“We are strong in a lot of different areas right now,” Saretsky said. “We have great depth and we have contributions being made from all the different areas, so it’s really exciting to see things coming together as a team.”
Kuzmuk went a bit further as she iterated her team’s desire to end the season with at least a third-place finish at the Heptagonal Championships.
“The big goal that we have as a team is to finish in the top three at Heps, and we have our eyes on competing against teams like Cornell,” Kuzmuk said. “ But I think that if we continue to give it our all, work together as a unit, and continue to support one another, we’ll be able to reach our goal.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A blocked punt in the first quarter of a Saturday-night exhibition game at Harvard Stadium gave the White team an early lead while prompting onlookers to wonder whether one of the more unlikely scenarios in sports would come to fruition.
Would Harvard’s defense actually manage to outscore its own offense?
But the Crimson, the team representing Harvard’s offensive unit, responded quickly to even up the scoreboard and later scored once more to give it a 14-7 win over the White team, Harvard’s defensive unit.
The White team set the tone early by keeping the Crimson from earning a first down in the opening possession and forcing the offense to punt, at which point freshman linebacker Connor Loftus blocked the punt attempt and returned the ball the three-yard distance to the goal line.
“I think it was a missed assignment,” said junior defensive back Daniel Minamide. “We have a really good special teams coach. He knows what he’s doing. We’ll get everything straightened out.”
The extra point attempt was good to give the White team a 7-0 lead.
“We like to see the defense get some points on the board,” added rising captain and linebacker Alex Gedeon.
But the offense was soon able to counter. Sophomore Colton Chapple had struggled to find his rhythm in his first set of downs under center, but the quarterback was much more effective when he got the ball after the White team’s opening touchdown. Chapple and classmate Rich Zajeski, a running back, teamed up to move the chains.
The Crimson got on the board when Chapple found junior wide receiver Adam Chrissis streaking down the right side of the field.
“I think Colton did a great job,” Gedeon said. “Last year, he kind of got thrown in there. He’s a really dependable guy.”
In a game that pitted upcoming Harvard athletes against each other, it was fitting that it was another young athlete, rising sophomore Thomas Schadewald, who scored the winning touchdown. Schadewald’s rush through the center gave the offense a second-quarter lead it would never relinquish.
With many players either injured or taking semesters off before competing as fifth-year seniors, the game was largely a contest among freshmen and sophomores.
“I’m happy that they got the opportunity to play and learn from that experience,” Minamide said.
Minamide was one of the few upperclassmen to participate.
“We’re lucky we have Dan Minamide,” Gedeon said.
But Minamide was just as impressed with the performance of his younger teammates.
“At least from a defensive secondary point of view, the young guys are doing a great job,” he said. “I’m definitely proud of how hard they work...We saw a lot of guys step up.”
Minamide noted that rookie corner Jaren Wilson has stood out this spring.
“He’s had to step up in just a huge way,” Minamide said. “He’s a really confident player. He’s still learning all the different parts, but he is doing a great job, and he is going to be a great player some day.”
Meanwhile, Minamide said that freshmen Rey Kirton had emerged as a leader from the safety position, and noted that Loftus and rookie linebacker Danny Frate have also stepped up.
“I think safeties have a little more responsibility,” Minamide said. “Rey’s done a great job in terms of learning...Also, Connor Loftus and Danny Frate: those two guys are doing an awesome job. They’re just flying.”
The offensive unit was similarly filled with young athletes—with returning-starter Chrissis one of the few exceptions—but at least two of the faces, sophomore running back Rich Zajeski and Chapple, were familiar.
Zajeski emerged as Harvard’s third-string back last fall, while injuries prompted Chapple to start three straight games, all of which were wins.
With rising fifth-year senior Collier Winters gone for the semester, Chapple has been taking all of the snaps with the first-team offense all spring.
“He’s been doing a really good job,” Minamide said. “People are starting to follow him and view him as a leader.”
Also taking snaps on Saturday were freshmen Michael Pruneau and Cory Briggs, who combined for five completions. Pruneau impressed on one play where he faked a handoff to freshman Damani Wilson before sprinting for a first down.
“Mike’s a really good athlete,” Gedeon said. “That’s going to be an asset: his ability to get out of the pocket and extend plays with his feet.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After struggling in its first spring tournament, the Harvard women’s golf team found its stride in the Spring Brown Bear Invitational two weeks ago, finishing second in a field of 12 teams.
In this weekend’s Ivy League Championships, the Crimson proved that performance wasn’t a fluke.
Harvard finished second overall, shooting a +53 at the three-day tournament at the Atlantic City Country Club in Northfield, N.J. Captain Mia Kabasakalis led the way for the Crimson, finishing second individually in a field of 35.
Yale took first place, finishing four strokes ahead of Harvard on the par-72 course with +49.
“You’re always disappointed when you come up a little bit short of what your goal is,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads said.  “[Coming in], I thought four teams could’ve won this week…It was going to come down to who prepared the best, and then who just executed the best for three days.”
“And we almost did that,” Rhoads continued. “Almost.”
The first half of the first round couldn’t have gone much better for the Crimson. After nine holes, captain Mia Kabasakalis and junior Christine Cho were +1, and the team’s four top scorers were just a combined +7.
“In the first nine holes, we were in a really, really good place,” Rhoads said.
But then Harvard began to slip. Rookie Bonnie Hu had consecutive double bogies on the 13th and the 14th, Chu had four running bogies, and Reuter was +5 on the final six holes. The Crimson still finished with a respectable +25, just three strokes behind the Bulldogs for the best score of the day.
But Harvard’s weak finish on day one had lasting consequences.
“The difference in the tournament was not what happened [Sunday] or what happened [Saturday] but really [what happened] the second half of the first round,” Rhoads said. “We let a very good round turn into a good round, and in the end, it’s only a couple shots that separates the top couple teams.”
A part of Harvard’s problem on Friday afternoon was the rough weather conditions. The course was both cold and windy, leading to quite high scores. In fact, the seven teams averaged 20 strokes less on Sunday than they did on Friday.
“It was really cold and really windy,” Kabasakalis said. “Pin placements were tough, and the wind was really drying up the greens. They were really slick.”
The weather let up slightly the next day, though scores remained high. The Crimson dropped four strokes from its performance on Friday, but Penn had a stronger showing to move into second place. Yale retained the lead.
While Kabasakalis had the low score again for the Harvard on the second day, finishing +4, Hu, usually Harvard’s most reliable player, continued to struggle on the scorecard. Prior to the tournament, Hu averaged just 3.24 strokes over-par each round. On Friday and Saturday, the freshman finished +8 and +7, respectively.
“The first round, she’d hit putts that would go right over the edge, and I’d say, ‘Just keep on hitting putts like that, and they will fall,’” Rhoads said. “And they didn’t fall at all in the first round. [In] the second, she started doing the same thing.”
But for Hu and the rest of the Crimson, everything clicked on Sunday.
Aided in part by the easier weather, Harvard dropped a full 14 strokes from its Saturday total. Kabasakalis and Hu tied for the low score on the team, as both players finished +1.
Hu had one of the best rounds of the year going, as she was -3 after 14 holes. But a triple bogey on the par-3 15th put the freshman back at even par, and she finished the day +1.
“Bonnie killed it today,” Kabasakalis said. “She struggled a little bit the first two days, but she came back in a big way today.”
Over the three days, Hu finished tied for 12th.
Kabasakalis’ +1 on Sunday gave her sole possession of second place individually. Though she averaged 6.53 strokes above-par during the season’s earlier matches, the senior finished +8 over the three rounds of the Ivy League Championship.
The rest of the team had strong finishes as well. Cho shot a 74 and finished in 10th place overall with a three-day total of +14. Junior Jane Lee finished with a 75 on Sunday, and freshman Fritzi Reuter came in with a team-high 78.
But the strong effort on Sunday wasn’t quite enough. The Bulldogs shot just +5 on the tournament’s final day, giving the team a four-stroke victory over the Crimson.
For Harvard, coming so close to victory made the second-place finish sting that much more.
“Yale played really well when they needed to today,” Rhoads said. “We got beat, which is better than beating yourselves, but it’s hard to come up only a couple shots short at the end of a long season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite dropping its first of four weekend games against rival Yale (22-15, 10-6 Ivy), 3-0, the Harvard baseball team (9-31, 5-11) rebounded to split Friday’s contests at O’Donnell Field, emerging victorious from the two teams’ second matchup by a score of 1-0.
Due to anticipated rain on Saturday afternoon, the first of two doubleheaders was played a day early on Friday afternoon. Two low-scoring pitching duels ensued, as both teams struggled from the plate.
HARVARD 1, YALE 0
A single up the middle of the field by senior centerfielder Dillon O’Neill—who went 2-for-4 in the game—catalyzed a series of strategic plays that led to the game’s winning run.
“This year we’re playing with the new aluminum bats,” freshman third baseman Jake McGuiggan said. “They don’t have as much pop as the old ones ... Sometimes we need to use the bunting game to manufacture runs.”
With O’Neill safely on first, Harvard’s next at-bat saw a sacrifice play by junior second baseman Jeff Reynolds help O’Neill advance to second base.
A fielding miscue by the Bulldogs allowed the senior to reach third base on the same play.
McGuiggan sealed the deal with another bunt, as the freshman squeezed O’Neill home to earn the RBI and put Harvard up by one.
“At that point, we hadn’t scored a run yet all day,” McGuiggan said. “It was really important for us to get at least one run on the board, even if it meant going for a suicide squeeze.”
“When Coach approached me about [the possibility of a squeeze], I knew it could have been the difference in the game,” McGuiggan continued. “It ended up being the difference. When we’re not scoring too many runs, any run we can get [is great].”
Though O’Neill would be the only runner on either team to cross home plate on Friday, Harvard earned six hits in the teams’ later matchup and committed zero fielding errors.
“The second game [against Yale] was one of the best ball games I’ve ever been involved in,” Walsh said.
On the mound, senior right-handed pitcher Max Perlman earned the win for the Crimson, striking out 10 batters out of the 31 he faced.
“Max was pitching exceptionally well,” Walsh said. “Around the sixth or seventh inning, he got his curveball going. I think they might have been able to chip away at him a little bit, but [Yale couldn’t beat him] once he got that curveball going.”
Perlman pitched Friday’s second game against the Bulldogs in its entirety, allowing only four hits in nine innings despite passing the 100-pitch mark in the eighth.
”His pitch count was high going into the last inning,” Walsh said. “I didn’t know if I was going to take him out ... When he said he wanted the ball, I said, ‘Great, let’s go with it.’”
With the win, Harvard evened the series, 1-1, heading into the final two contests of the weekend.
YALE 3, HARVARD 0
Three early runs on a walk and Harvard error put the Crimson in a deep hole, as the team dropped the opening game of this year’s Harvard/Yale series.
Senior pitcher Eric Eadington walked the first batter home after loading the bases in the first, and a fielding error allowed two more runs to score before the initial frame expired.
Though Yale senior pitcher Vinny Lally got off to a slow start, walking two Harvard batters to start the game, the Crimson was unable to capitalize.
Lally caught a Harvard runner leading on second base and struck out two batters to close the inning without a Crimson score.
“It was one of our worst first innings,” Walsh said. “Things got better after that.”
Despite the sluggish start, pitching was impressive on both sides, as Lally—who has yet to lose a game this year—struck out nine Harvard batters and Eadington earned seven strikeouts of his own. Both starters pitched for seven innings.
“In the first game, [there was] outstanding pitching,” Walsh said. “Eadington] lost the first game, 3-0, but a couple missed plays in the first inning [gave Yale the early lead].”
Though no runs were scored after the top of the first inning, Yale earned four hits on in the opening game of the series. Harvard earned its only hit in the fourth inning, as junior designated hitter Marcus Way singled up the middle.
“We only had one hit,” Walsh said. “It’s so discouraging for our bats at this time of year. I won’t take anything away from their pitcher ... He was tough, and we knew that but we had him on the ropes in the first inning [and didn’t capitalize].”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the realm of academics, the university has never been a stranger to facing off against the best and brightest the world has to offer.
But, a mere fortnight after the men’s soccer team faced off against Haiti, the women posted a similar challenge to a cross-continental opponent, showing that Harvard can compete internationally in athletics as well.
The Crimson (9-7-1, 4-3 Ivy) hosted the Irish women’s national team at Soldiers Field Soccer Stadium, toppling its opponents, 2-1, in a thrilling friendly match.
“I think it was a good result,” Harvard coach Ray Leone said. “They were very good, but we had about four or five good opportunities, and we managed to finish on two of them.”
Set to play without its six seniors from the fall, the Crimson women’s soccer team came together Friday night to get a head start on next year’s fall campaign. First on the agenda was teamwork.
“We really spend a bunch of time trying to work hard on improving [our] team play,” Leone said. “We lost a lot of great players in this senior class, and this game gave us a chance to see where we have gaps and try to fill them.”
Luckily for Harvard, the junior class was up to the task.
Led by junior co-captain defender Lindsey Kowal, the women got off to a great start on the pitch, lacing the ball through their opponents and maintaining most of the possession.
“Without a doubt, our strongest suit Friday night was our ball movement,” Leone said. “We maintained it for about three-quarters of the match, and it really made a difference. No particular players stood out on the field; it was really a team effort.”
That is, besides the two who scored.
Junior midfielder Rebecca Millock, recipient of an All-Ivy League Honorable Mention in the fall, was the first to get on the scoreboard, powering the ball out of the goalkeeper’s reach and straight into the back of the net.
Millock, who finished her junior season with 12 shots in 17 games, had often struggled to find the net in her Crimson career, never recording a goal for Harvard.
Still, for both her teammates and coach Leone, the result of her strike this time was far from unexpected.
“Rebecca’s had a lot of good shots for us this spring,” Leone said. “But this one, she just crushed. From the moment it left her cleat, that ball looked destined for the goal.”
Then, when the Irish team fought back to bring the game to 1-1, the Crimson had a response to quell the comeback rally.
Junior midfielder Sophie Legros, who had also never put one in the net for Harvard, struck gold with her first shot since her sophomore season, giving her team a one-goal edge over their visitors which would prove the difference.
Legros, who played for Henin-Beaumont of the France Feminine Division I League, was no stranger to the European style of play, and as one of the squad’s only two international players, it just seemed to fit.
“Before the game, I let her know that this was her game to play and her game to win,” Leone said. “We were very happy to see her be the one to score the winning goal.”
Proving its mettle without the senior class that took part in back-to-back Ivy League titles in 2008 and 2009 and NCAA tournament berths in both those years, Harvard has high hopes for the fall season.
“It’s been a little tough filling their shoes, but we’ve been working really hard this spring doing a lot more than we usually do,” junior defender Patricia Yau said. “I think that all that hard work has paid off, and it’s shown in our later games [this spring].”
The team will be returning junior co-captain Melanie Baskind, who was tied for first as the top goalscorer with nine strikes on the season.
Sophomore standout Alexandra Conigliaro, who was good for four goals and four assists this past season, will give the Crimson the attacking punch it’ll need to go deep in the Ancient Eight.
“I’m excited,” Yau said. “We’ve learned a lot more about each other playing this spring, and our chemistry is great. I think we’ll have a very strong core returning next season, and if the recruiting class can come and fill in [our gaps], it will be a great season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard softball coach Jenny Allard celebrated her birthday yesterday in a big way.
The Crimson (28-14, 12-2 Ivy) took on Yale (15-21, 6-8) in an Ivy League doubleheader at Soldiers Field and easily took a pair of victories over the Bulldogs, 8-0 and 11-1.
Allard’s birthday wasn’t the only celebration going on at the field yesterday. Harvard’s two lone seniors and co-captains, infielder Ellen Macadam and outfielder Emily Henderson, were honored as part of the team’s annual Senior Day festivities. Allard was impressed with how the veteran duo performed against Yale.
“Both of our seniors played great today,” Allard said. “They showed great leadership out there. Ellen and [Emily] played great defensively and made some things happen on offense.”
HARVARD 11, YALE 1
In the second game of yesterday’s doubleheader, the Crimson got on the board early and never looked back.
Macadam got the ball rolling for Harvard with a base hit to center field to lead off the game. Sophomore Stephanie Regan reached on a Bulldog error, and freshman Kasey Lange was hit by a pitch to load the bases with no outs for the Crimson’s cleanup hitter, junior first baseman Whitney Shaw.
Shaw crushed a pitch from Yale’s Kristen Leung, sending it over the left-field wall for a grand slam.
“The bases were loaded, and I knew that it was important to attack them early on and keep the rally going,” Shaw said. “Everyone had done a great job of getting on base. I was trying to get a base hit—it happened to go out.”
Shaw and the high-powered Harvard offense gave the squad a lead, and the team’s pitching didn’t allow Yale to mount a comeback. Freshman Laura Ricciardone was on the mound for the Crimson, and pitched a solid five innings, giving up just one earned run.
After Ricciardone shut out the Bulldogs in the top of the second, Harvard went back to work offensively. Macadam hit her second single of the game to left field and stole a base to put herself in scoring position.
Regan brought the senior home with an RBI single to right field, pushing the Crimson lead to 5-0.
After Leung walked Lange and an error allowed freshman Allison Scott to reach first, the bases were once again loaded for Harvard. And when sophomore Ashley Heritage hit a two-RBI double to centerfield, Yale coach Barbara Reinalda decided that the day was over for her freshman hurler, bringing in sophomore Jackie Manzer to try to contain the streaking Crimson offense.
But the runs didn’t stop coming for Harvard. Manzer walked junior Mari Zumbro to load the bases for junior Jane Alexander. She hit an infield grounder, and the Bulldogs converted on a play at the plate, but Alexander reached on the fielder’s choice to keep the bases loaded with two outs.
Harvard’s offense wasn’t finished. Sophomore Olivia Piccione doubled on a long fly ball to left field, bringing in two more Crimson runners and making the score, 9-0.
Yale wasn’t out of the frame just yet—Harvard scored two more runs on a Macadam double before the third out.
Yale’s sole score of the twinbill came in the top of the fourth inning, when Christy Nelson homered to left-center field. Despite the one blemish of the day, members of the Harvard squad were happy with how they handled their Ivy opponent.
“Yale is good competition,” Shaw said. “In all three aspects of the game, we dominated. We outhit them, we outpitched them, and we played solid defense.”
HARVARD 8, YALE 0
The first contest of the doubleheader began as a pitcher’s duel between the Crimson’s Rachel Brown and the Bulldogs’ Chelsey Dunham. Unlike the second game in which Harvard had immediate offensive production, Dunham was able to stifle the Crimson for four full innings.
“[Dunham] did a good job of coming out and hitting her spots,” Allard said. “It took us a little while to get going offensively, but our defense kept us in it.”
On Easter Sunday, the Harvard offense finally rose up in the bottom of the fifth inning.
Heritage singled to right field and stole second, putting her in scoring position. She came home on a squeeze play, and shaky defense from Yale allowed Alexander to reach on the sacrifice bunt.
After Heritage’s run, the Crimson quickly opened up the game, scoring three runs in the fifth inning and five in the sixth.
“We made it happen—the squeeze was really clutch on Ashley and Jane’s part,” Shaw said. “It’s a part of our game, making little things happen out of nothing.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It looks like Ivy League softball is headed for a rematch.
After Harvard fell to Cornell in a decisive third game in last season’s Ivy League Championships, the Crimson and the Big Red both sit atop the North and South Divisions, respectively, of the Ancient Eight.
Harvard, with a 12-2 league record has more or less clinched its spot in the finals, barring a colossal breakdown in the last week of the season.
At 9-5, Cornell hasn’t demonstrated the same league dominance as the Crimson. But the division is the Big Red’s to lose with just four games left in the regular season.
All that separates Cornell from a rematch is a home-and-home with the Ivy League cellar-dwelling Princeton team. The Tigers are just 4-10 in league play and have lost their last six straight.
Cornell went 3-1 against Princeton in 2010, and the two have not yet met this season.
Harvard has six games left before its second straight Ivy League Championship appearance. The team plays a doubleheader tomorrow against Yale—a pair of makeup games for Saturday’s rainouts—before a home-and-home of its own this weekend against Dartmouth.
The Bulldogs and the Big Green—both 6-8—share the last-place spot in the North Division.
Once again, two weeks from now, Harvard softball won’t just be worrying about its academic finals. Cornell may be its biggest test.

Just when we thought Zuckerberg was done for good with Winklevi drama and all other legal matters, Paul D. Ceglia of Wellsville, NY filed a lawsuit against Facebook claiming partial ownership of the company.
The name Ceglia might ring a bell. Last July, Ceglia sued Zuckerberg for "monetary damages and 84 percent ownership of Facebook, Inc.," according to the civil suit document. As evidence for the claim, a "Work For Hire" contract was put forth in which Ceglia allege that Zuckerberg had sold Ceglia 50 percent of a project cited in the document as "The Face Book" for $1,000. At the time, Zuckerberg is purported to have helped code Ceglia's project "StreetFax.com." Facebook dismissed the civil suit as a scam and the contract as a forgery.
Ceglia's record is all but clean. In 1997, he pleaded guilty to possession of 400 grams of psilocybin (or hallucinogenic mushrooms). Later, in 2010 Ceglia was sued by New York Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo for running a fraudulent wood-pellet fuel distribution company in Wellsville, NY and defrauding customers of over $200,000. The case was settled in October 2010.
Now Ceglia is back with a Winklevossian persistence. He re-filed an amended 25-page lawsuit and has produced leaked emails from an alleged correspondence with Zuckerberg from seven years ago.
While the legitimacy of the emails is still under debate, the alleged correspondence sheds interesting light on the continuing metamorphosis of Zuckerberg's public image. In some portions of the correspondence Ceglia attacks Zuckerberg's purported sense of Harvard entitlement.
"I'm starting to think you just blew that money Mark. You know perfectly well that you can't just take a persons [sic] investment and then spend it on women and beer or whatever you do up there in Harvard. I've been stalled long enough on this thing and if I don't see something soon I'll have no choice but to contact the school and perhaps your parents in Dobbs Ferry and let them know whats [sic] been going on," Ceglia purportedly wrote in an email.
With all this in mind, the screenshot of Ceglia's Facebook page is doubly ironic. Under "Philosophy," Ceglia quotes Gandhi's famous quote "An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind."

Love letters seem to be a thing of the past. But if you've always dreamed of possessing a few, especially from an iconic American figure, be sure to head to New York after finals with your checkbook in hand.
On May 19, Christie's, the world renowned auction house, is auctioning off 22 love letters from a young Jackie O to her Harvard beau, R. Beverley Corbin, Jr. '47. Also known as "Bev" and "Buddy Darling" in Jackie's letters, Corbin was a member of the Owl Club.
The letters, which are all handwritten in blue ink, are part of Christie's "Printed and Manuscript Americana" sale and are expected to fetch $25,000 to $35,000 at the auction.
Christie's has described the letters as "Love Letters from a Feisty, Teenage Jackie Bouvier to her Harvard Boyfriend."
The letters were written between 1945 and 1947 when Jackie was a teenager at Miss Porter's boarding school in Connecticut. They chronicle the long distance relationship between Jackie and her Harvard boyfriend and reveal a particularly witty side of her teenage years. Jackie, for instance, suggests in her letters that her beau should smuggle cigarettes, chocolate, and a hip flask to shock a certain "Mrs. J."
The letters also reveal some of Jackie's thoughts on the future.
"I'm never going to send my children to boarding school," Jackie wrote. "The boys can go to P.S. 148 with gangsters, and then go to Columbia & the girls can go to Hunter College and they'll all be morons but at least they wont have to tear around and get their teeth knocked out playing hockey every day ... Can you think of anything worse than living in a small town like this all your life and competing to see which housewife could bake the best cake?"

Harvard received stellar reviews this week in the second-annual list of the "311 Greenest Colleges" released by The Princeton Review and the U.S. Green Building Council.
Based on a survey of school administrators conducted last year, the guide evaluated each college on its commitment to sustainability goals. In particular, criteria included energy consumption, carbon footprint, budget for locally grown food, waste diversion rate, and the presence of environmentally-focused student groups on campus.
While it did not include a hierarchical ranking of schools, the list gave honorable mention to Harvard and 17 other colleges for achieving a "Green Rating" of 99 out of 100.
"I think the recognition is well deserved," said Kurt Tsuo '11, co-captain of the Resource Efficiency Program on campus. "The University has done a lot to reduce its environmental impact and stick by its 2008 goal to reduce carbon emissions."

Last Sunday, Far East Movement headlined the sixth annual Yardfest performance, drawing a record audience of students and prefrosh. After the show, the four members of the group stayed for a meet and greet before visiting the Harvard party scene.
Far East Movement posted on their twitter, "thank you harvard. yardfest was bananas. where's the parties they had in the social network?"
They were later spotted at the Owl, talking to students and playing beer pong.
"There were a lot of people there. It was really fun," said Neimy Escobar, a prefrosh. "They were just chilling. It wasn't like they were put on a pedestal. They were very nice to everybody."
According to Escobar, all four members of Far East Movement were at the Owl.
"I talked to the one in the blue, the one who fell while crowd surfing, for a good 15 minutes with two other prefrosh," Escobar said. "He was trying to convince us to go to Harvard. He said where else do you get to party with the Far East Movement."
On their website, Far East Movement put up a blog post with photos from their time at Harvard. The post can be seen here.
