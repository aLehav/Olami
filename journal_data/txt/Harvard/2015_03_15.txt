After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

PHILADELPHIA—“I was wide open.”
“It went in.”
That’s how co-captain Steve Moundou-Missi described one of the biggest shots in Harvard men’s basketball history. It was an eighteen-footer from just right of the top of the key. It left Moundou-Missi’s hands with eight seconds left and his team tied at 51 against Yale in Saturday’s Ivy Playoff game.
It went in.
***
“This is what you dream about.”
That’s what senior wing Wesley Saunders said about the win—about the run he’s had. The 53-51 victory sends the Crimson to its fourth straight NCAA Tournament. Saunders has had the same spring break plans every year of his college career.
***
“What an afternoon.” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said in an understatement as usual. “What an afternoon for Ivy League basketball.”
***
Before Moundou-Missi’s shot, there was the pass.
Saunders had scored 18 of the Crimson’s 28 second-half points coming into the possession (he finished with 22 points in the game), so Amaker put the ball in his playmaker’s hands once more.
With the shot clock off, Saunders started dancing towards the hoop. “Wait! Wait!” coaches and players yelled to him from the bench. Wait he did, backing out and exchanging the ball with junior co-captain Siyani Chambers as the clock showed 20 seconds left, and then 15.
Eventually Saunders got the ball back and strode to his right. He crossed his defender over and moved towards the hoop. Eight feet away from it, he picked up his dribble and half-spun into the paint until his back was to the basket. That’s when he saw Moundou-Missi curling behind him, his defender focused on Saunders’ drive.
Saunders dumped the ball back and Moundou-Missi did the rest.
“I trust Steve to knock down that shot more than I trust myself,” Saunders said. “I was just looking to make a play, and I got into the paint and they collapsed, and he made the right play to come behind and knock down the shot.”
Amaker tried to call a timeout at that point, but the officials did not hear him as the Bulldogs inbounded the ball and raced up the court. Javier Duren got by Saunders inside the arc and leaned around Moundou-Missi to throw up a shot with one second left. He said afterwards he thought it was going in. It didn’t, and neither did a tip back attempt from Justin Sears.
The Harvard players screamed towards the middle of the court. Almost exactly a week earlier, some of them had celebrated in an empty Lavietes Pavilion as Dartmouth beat Yale with a buzzer-beater to force Saturday’s tie-breaking Playoff game.
Now they got to celebrate with a horde of Crimson supporters, having beaten the Elis with a late game shot of their own.
That shot meant Harvard could forget its loss to Yale last week and the nine-point lead it let slip away in the final minutes this Saturday.
After a back-and-forth first half, the Crimson had opened up a 46-37 lead with a little over six minutes remaining thanks to a 15-point Saunders outburst over just eight minutes of play. It started with an and-one layup and included back-to-back three-pointers, the second of which Saunders celebrated by galloping nearly the length of the floor.
With 1:27 left in the game, Saunders was jumping again, but this time in frustration rather than elation.
Yale had put together a 12-2 run over the preceding few minutes, starting with an and-one from Sears and including six straight made free throws from Duren. That stretch ended when the Bulldogs took a 49-48 lead with 1:47 left on a Makai Mason jumper, eliciting a roar from the blue half of The Palestra.
Saunders thought he had recaptured the lead on the ensuing possession by driving diagonally from right to left across the basket, throwing up a shot with his right hand along the way. It went in despite a foul, but the officials ruled that contact came before the shot, meaning it would not count. Saunders protested while jumping up and down.
The officials decided to review the call and ultimately ruled in Saunders’ favor. The basket counted and he got a free throw. He nailed it to put Harvard up, 51-49.
Duren then tied the game with 55 seconds to play with two more free throws after being fouled with three seconds left on Yale’s shot clock.
The Crimson wound the shot clock down on its next possession before Moundou-Missi got an open look in the corner with 37 seconds left. Afterwards, he said that he thought the shot was going in, but it rattled it. A battle for the rebound led to the ball bouncing out of bounds. The officials said it bounced off a Bulldog and confirmed the call after a video review, setting up Moundou-Missi for his historic redemption.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 14, 2015, 7:30 p.m.
Playing in front of a raucous home crowd and a trip to Minnesota on the line, the third-seeded Harvard women’s ice hockey team (26-5-3, 16-4-2 ECAC) defeated Quinnipiac (26-9-3, 15-5-2), 5-0, on Saturday to book its sixth Frozen Four appearance in the history of the program and its first since 2008.
Saturday marked the fourth time that the rivals have faced each other this season, with the Crimson having taken home the first three matchups—two of which were decided in overtime—by the same score each time, 2-1.
This time, Harvard made sure to beat the Bobcats by a more convincing margin, avoiding the possibility of any late game drama en route to its quarterfinals victory.
“All three of those games were pretty similar games,” Crimson coach Katey Stone said. “We made a few adjustments this week that opened things up through the middle…. I think we had a few different attack options [but] out kids just made plays and they were ready to go.”
Harvard demonstrated its depth early on, as the third line made an early impact, helping the Crimson jump out to a two-goal lead in the first period while keeping Bobcat goaltender Chelsea Laden busy in goal.
Sophomore Abbey Frazer opened up the scoring for Harvard with a close shot on goal, the third goal for the defenseman this season, after classmate Briana Mastel found the forward inside one of the faceoff circles.
Freshman Haley Mullens doubled the Crimson advantage at the 9:05 mark, gaining control of the puck inside the attacking faceoff circle before turning around and shooting it past Laden. Third-line forward Karly Heffernan provided the assist on the play after also winning the initial faceoff.
“Our depth is what [has] gotten us so far,” co-captain Samantha Reber said. “We can throw anyone out against anyone’s top line and they will matchup if not put them on their toes and heels…It says a lot about our team, and it’s going to really help us move on in Minnesota.”
Laden had her hands full early on, as Harvard launched 10 shots on goal compared to the seven which Quinnipiac sent towards junior goalkeeper Emerance Maschmeyer (20 saves).
The second period saw the Bobcat attack come to life, as Quinnipiac attempted 23 shots—nine on target—forcing Maschmeyer to stay on her toes.
“As a goalie you love when the other team gets shots, [but] at the same time you don’t want too many,” Maschmeyer said. “My mentality was just one shot, one save at a time and not getting too far ahead of myself.”
While Harvard struggled to keep up the pace from the first period, tallying only four shots on target, the Crimson was able to do what the Bobcats couldn’t—convert one of its shots into a score.
Reber would break through at the 3:37 mark of the second to extend the Crimson lead, scoring her seventh goal of the season from just outside the crease off an assist by second-line sophomore defenseman Marissa Gedman.
This would cause Quinnipiac coach Rick Seeley to pull Laden, placing sophomore Sydney Rossman in goal instead. The Excelsior, Minn. native had seen the ice in only three games this season before being substituted on.
Quinnipiac obtained a power play in its favor later on in the period after Gedman was penalized for tripping but was unable to capitalize despite attempting four shots over the two allotted minutes. Missed opportunities were the story of the night for the Bobcats, who were unable to convert on any of their three power plays.
With a three-goal advantage already under its belt at the beginning of the third stanza, Harvard added extra assurance when sophomore Sydney Daniels provided her 19th goal of the season on a Crimson power play to extend the advantage to four.
The final touches were added by freshman Karly Heffernan, who placed Harvard’s fifth puck into the Bobcat net off an assist by Lexie Laing,
The team now travels to Minnesota, where it will face local rival No. 2/2 Boston College in a rematch of the Beanpot final, a match in which Harvard came out on top against the then-No. 1 Eagles, 3-2.
This time, the stakes will be larger as the rivals square off with more than just bragging rights on the line, as the winner will punch a ticket to the national championship game next Sunday.
“We love the challenge.” Maschmeyer said. “You want to play against teams that want to beat you. It’s so much more fun when they’re fired up too. They’re going to come out strong and we’re going to come out stronger, so it will be an awesome matchup.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 15, 2015, at 1:09 a.m.
NEW HAVEN, Conn.—Harvard sophomore forward Sean Malone saw an opening on Alex Lyon’s blocker side. Seconds later, Yale senior forward Trent Ruffolo saw the puck in the back of the Crimson’s net.
For the Harvard men’s ice hockey team, roughly five seconds in the final minute made the difference in a 2-0 loss in Game 2 of the ECAC tournament quarterfinals on Saturday.
Skating with an extra attacker on a penalty kill, Malone created a rush off the Crimson bench and clanged an open wrist shot off Yale’s inside left post, which forwarded the puck to Ruffolo, who buried an insurance marker from neutral ice into Harvard’s empty net with 27 seconds left in regulation at Ingalls Rink.
The score held for sophomore goaltender Lyon’s school-record seventh shutout of the season as the Bulldogs (18-8-5, 12-6-4 ECAC) staved off elimination and forced a deciding Game 3 date with the Crimson (18-12-3, 11-8-3) on Sunday.
“I think we’re frustrated because I thought we played a good game, did a lot of good things,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “Our guys kept coming…. Give [Yale] credit; they played well, but I thought our guys really battled and played a good hockey game and carried the play for most of the night.”
In a tight defensive game, Yale junior defenseman Mitch Witek was the only skater to beat either goaltender on Saturday, getting the Bulldogs on the board off an outside deflected shot at 3:43 in the second period. The Crimson rang iron twice in the last six minutes of the final period, including a crossbar attempt from sophomore forward Alex Kerfoot in the slot.
Despite consistent Harvard pressure in the game’s final stages, Yale sophomore forwards Chris Izmirlian and Mike Doherty broke free for a 2-on-1 break that forced Crimson junior defenseman Desmond Bergin into a hooking penalty with 1:40 left in regulation, taking away Harvard’s chance to tie the game with six attackers. Yet Malone, coming off the bench with a minute gone in the penalty kill and Michalek pulled, came painstakingly close to an equalizer regardless.
“That last one by Malone is a great shot and just kind of indicative of how the game was going,” Crimson co-captain Max Everson said. “Pucks just weren’t crossing the goal line for us.”
A night after winning at Ingalls Rink for the first time since Jan. 2005, the Crimson started the night a step quicker than the Bulldogs, carrying the play in the first period and drawing two power plays. Lyon’s blocker turned away the first frame’s best opportunity—a backdoor chance by junior co-captain Kyle Criscuolo off a feed from classmate Jimmy Vesey on a power play.
In the second period, Harvard continued to limit Yale’s opportunities to the outside, yet Witek telegraphed one of those opportunities in. Sophomore forward Frankie DiChiara created space at the left point for the junior defenseman, who snapped an open shot that deflected off the stick of Criscuolo, who had fallen to the ice for the shot-block.
“I think we just played a lot better than we did yesterday,” said Witek, who picked up his fourth career goal in 87 games. “We started out a little bit slow yesterday. We had more intensity tonight.”
Lyon (24 saves) had plenty of help from his teammates, who clogged up shooting lanes and blocked 19 Harvard shot attempts. The Crimson went 0-for-4 on the power play, and Vesey, who leads Division I in goals per game, was held to only two shots on goal.
Michalek (19 saves), meanwhile, was tested sparingly Saturday, yet he toed away a two-on-one Yale break early in the third frame and padded away a second-chance opportunity from junior forward Cody Learned in the slot with 3:30 left.
The Crimson and Bulldogs now rank tied-for-17th and 14th in the PairWise Rankings, respectively. Both will need a win on Sunday to extend their respective seasons.
“I think if we bring the same compete-level and the same effort, we can expect a different result tomorrow night,” Everson said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PHILADELPHIA—All attention was on senior wing Wesley Saunders as he, head down, barreled his way into the paint. As he planted his left foot in the heart of the key, his defender took a slight step backward, likely anticipating the trademark Saunders spin move—not the reverse pivot that took place instead, and certainly not his shovel pass to co-captain Steve Moundou-Missi that took place moments later.
And with the defense collapsed on Saunders, Moundou-Missi was wide open from the top of the key. He showed no hesitation before letting the ball go, and showed no sign of a celebration after the ball splashed through the net. But as he held his right wrist up in the air, the Harvard student section jumped to its feet. With Yale’s ensuing layup attempt unsuccessful as the clock wound down, the Harvard men’s basketball team was officially going dancing, defeating Yale, 53-51, in the conference’s one-game playoff Saturday afternoon at The Palestra.
“I trust Steve,” Saunders said. “He’s been carrying us down this last stretch defensively, offensively. I knew [that Yale was] going to collapse on me, and he played off my penetration, and he knocked down that shot—like I knew he would.”
Moundou-Missi’s demeanor in the game’s waning moments was indicative of the senior’s play over the past eight days, a performance that Saunders said has “carried” the team. After scoring 21 points in a losing effort against the Bulldogs (22-10, 11-3 Ivy) last Friday, Moundou-Missi once again kept the Crimson (22-7, 11-3) in the contest through his 36 minutes of play on Saturday afternoon—even when his teammates were struggling to find the bottom of the net.
The big man knocked down what was only his fourth three of the season in the first half to tie the game, limited conference player of the year Justin Sears to just five points in the second period, and, of course, sent the Crimson marching into madness with his straightaway jumper with less than 10 seconds remaining.
“Coach [Tommy Amaker] has been telling me to shoot the ball when I’m open—it’s a matter of confidence and not thinking about it,” Moundou-Missi said.
After the game, Moundou-Missi shrugged off the praise sent his way. It was Saunders’s set-up, Saunders’s pass, that won the game, he claimed—all he had to do was make the “wide open” shot.
But for a player more known for his defensive efforts than his offensive game, his last-second heroics epitomize the ‘madness’ so characteristic of collegiate basketball in March.
SAUNDERS’S THEATER
With just over 13 minutes to play, junior co-captain Siyani Chambers lobbed a long pass to backcourt-mate Saunders, who was waiting on the right wing. Saunders had just drilled a triple from the same spot, and immediately arced up another shot, with the Yale defense scrambling to get back in transition. As the ball sliced through the hoop, the ever-stoic Saunders turned away from the basket and began to skip up the court. He skipped all the way to Yale’s side of the floor, facing the Eli faithful, and stared at the sea of Yale blue before performing an emphatic, emotional fist pump.
Chants of “Let’s go Saunders” rained down from the Harvard student section, rewarding the senior for the latest basket in his personal 9-0 run—a 1:39 stretch of time in which Saunders singlehandedly transformed his team’s five-point deficit into a four-point lead, 36-32.
“[Saunders] made every big play we needed,” Amaker said. “[He had] big passes, big plays…. I’ve always said about Wesley what I said about Jeremy [Lin ’10], which is that it’s not about the points he scores, but the points he is responsible for. He put us on his back and carried us.”
The spurt began after Yale guard Javier Duren hit a contested floater to extend the Bulldogs’ advantage to 32-27. Only seconds later, Saunders received a pass on the right wing, bulldozed his way to the block, and bumped bodies with a Yale defender while spinning the ball into the basket. And one.
On the next defensive play, Saunders’s spiked down Duren’s attempted entry pass, before an Eli missed shot gave the Crimson the ball once more. Moundou-Missi found his classmate on the right wing, where Saunders shot over the outstretched arm of Bulldog Justin Sears. That basket gave Harvard its first lead since the opening half, setting up his transition triple—and his series of leaps to the Yale side of the court—just one minute later.
The game was still close, still only a two-possession game, but Harvard was back in control. And with Saunders replacing his typical dispassionate façade with his series of skips and his final, emotional fist pump, the Crimson ballooned its run to 17-5, effectively sealing the game both with Saunders’s passion and his performance.
“He made a lot of key baskets,” Yale coach James Jones said. “He stepped up and made some shots. We guarded him with a couple different guys, but he was able to knock down shots. That’s what good players do…. You expect he will step up and make plays.”
PLAY ON
A win today, and Yale would’ve been competing in its first NCAA Tournament since 1962. Instead, the Elis will spend Selection Sunday waiting to hear whether they were allotted a bid to the NIT, a tournament thought of as a little brother to March Madness.
Harvard, meanwhile, will head from the hardwood of The Palestra back to Cambridge, where, at 6 p.m. Sunday night, it will find out where it’s competing and who it’s competing against when it takes the floor of the Big Dance later this week.
The ticket punched with tonight’s victory marks Harvard’s fourth consecutive NCAA Tournament berth following a 66-year drought.
For this team’s seniors, several of whom were so crucial in the late stages of Saturday’s contest, the win against Yale guaranteed a fairy-tale ending of sorts to their collegiate careers, as while they entered as freshmen into a program that had never won an outright Ivy title, they will graduate never having lost the Ancient Eight crown. For these seniors, Moundou-Missi’s shot guaranteed that they will finish their times in Crimson at the exact place that they reached in historical fashion three years ago—at the heart of March’s madness.
“As a class, we talked about what we want our legacy to be,” Saunders said. “We wanted to cement our legacy tonight and come out with a victory. And we were able to do that.”
