After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rock singer-songwriter Patti Smith’s new book is a collection of photographs inspired by her recent journey on Instagram, which began in 2018. To create “A Book of Days,” Smith chose a photo to represent each day of the year, drawing from her collection of polaroids, cell phone photos, and the Internet. The collection is a form of print preservation, including old photos of Smith, aesthetic stacks of books, and photos of late social activists or musicians, most of which she posted on Instagram over the years. For readers, it's a reminder to appreciate the little moments every day and to spend time remembering the people and events of the past.
Sometimes, the photos feel insignificant: The collection is ultimately the product of an old woman who gets Instagram and starts posting screenshots of Safari images or photos of her coffee and old shirts. But Smith is not just any old woman. She has created an intimate aesthetic. Everyone wishes they could be Patti Smith, drinking coffee, reading obscure books, looking at statues, and taking photos with other cool rock and roll stars. There is an undeniable appeal to the aesthetic of Smith’s collection, but all of it can be found for free by following her Instagram account. It's easy, flipping through, for a reader to wonder, is this necessary? Why create a book out of photos that Instagram has seen first?
For anyone who isn’t a huge Patti Smith fan, “A Book of Days” is a coffee table book at best. It is the perfect size and shape for display with a simple yet enticing cover: Black with gold lettering, the cover features a black-and-white photo of Smith and her polaroid camera.
Certain photos offer interesting, sometimes comical, insights into the life of a ’70s rocker in her old age. With her career as an author, Smith ensures she doesn’t remain trapped in an image of her in her 20s, as many of her fellow legendary musicians have.
In one image in the book, Smith stands with her long gray hair next to Keanu Reeves. The captions reads, “Wishing a worthy fellow a happy birthday.” Photos of her with other celebrities are scattered about the pages, usually featured on their birthdays. In the introduction, Smith writes that for her, Instagram has served as a way to celebrate birthdays by remembering the departed and saluting our youth. “‘A Book of Days’ is a glimpse of how I navigate this culture in my own way,” she writes. With her photos, she attempts to influence the way people use social media, to turn it into a positive space for others like it is for her. And it is effective: The accessibility of some of the images remind people to look for that simple beauty and the feel-good moments in their own lives and share it with others.
64 of the photos in the book are not hers. They are photos of famous people, usually activists including Greta Thunberg, Martin Luther King Jr., and Hellen Keller’s teacher, Anne Sullivan. The outside photos seem out of place amidst photos taken by Smith, but the brief captions oftentimes include interesting tidbits. For instance, the Dec. 11 photo praises Alice Augusta Ball, who developed the first successful treatment for leprosy and died at 24. The captions accompanying more well known celebrities are shorter, thankfully, to avoid redundancy.
Other photos are placed without much context, however, like a photo of a wrinkled shirt on a bed that could easily be mistaken for someone trying to sell their old clothes on Poshmark. But the shirt has a deeper meaning: It was a gift from Michael Stipe, lead singer of R.E.M.
Photos like these offer an interesting glimpse into the way Smith thinks and interacts with the world, finding simple moments to appreciate each day: a gift from a friend, a cup of tea, how the books stack up on her desk, or reflections on travels.
There are also a lot of photos of beds. Either famous people’s beds or photos of beds that she slept in while traveling. At first glance, the beds seem out of place, or insignificant. But after some thought, the intimacy of the photos makes the reader spend a little more time thinking about where we spend almost a third of our lives without second thought. The photos also break the convention of social media, which can sometimes pressure people into only posting pictures of themselves.
Maybe more people should post photos of beds on Instagram. Currently, apps like Instagram hinder people. Kids get addicted to them; they are overwhelming sources of social comparison; They spread misinformation and allow for social media activism rather than tangible action. These issues are so prominent, some teenagers are even ditching cell phones altogether to escape the influence of social media. Smith acknowledges these issues, but thinks that social media can work for the better, too.
“Social media, in its twisting democracy, sometimes courts cruelty, reactionary commentary, misinformation and nationalism,” she writes. But as the book proves “It can also serve us. It’s in our hands.”

“On some level I knew horror wasn’t just about monsters doing bad things,” S. Trimble writes in the opening essay of “It Came From the Closet,” “It’s also about doing gender badly.”
This notion undergirds much of Joe Vallese’s anthology, released in early October by the Feminist Publishing Press and comprised of 25 essays from a talented group of queer and trans writers. “It Came From the Closet” dives head first into the muddy waters of horror — a genre notorious for its demonization of queerness and gender nonconformity — and the queer people that consume, question, and love it despite its problematic history. Replete with beautiful, memoir-style narratives, this collection of essays is well worth the read regardless of the reader’s affinity for horror or movie analysis.
While many of the essays use queerness as a lens through which to analyze horror, horror is also used to explore ambiguous notions of queerness. Though these two paradigms serve as the backbone of the anthology, they are far from the only things discussed as authors grapple with race, religion, disability, parenthood, family, illness, grief, friendship, and even twinship. These 25 essays traverse a vast sea of topics, gifting the reader with brief glimpses into an array of different lives, experiences, and interiorities. Some authors attempt to do what Trimble (author of the essay “A Demon-Girl’s Guide to Life”) citing Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick calls a “reparative reading”— an alternative way of looking at these films that explicates their resonances with queerness rather than their demonization of such; other authors like Zefyr Lisowski (writer of “The Girl, the Well, the Ring”) are far more critical of the genre that has historically weaponized queerness, transness, and gender non-conformity as a signifier of monstrosity.
These internal discrepancies, however, speak to the most compelling things about this book: The diversity in stylistic approach, the varying ways authors found to weave together horror and queer existence, and the multitude of lives that come alive on the page. Particularly notable essays include “The Girl, the Well, the Ring” by Lisowski, which intertwines analysis of “The Ring” and “Pet Semetary” with musings on chronic illness and disability; “Black Body Snatchers” by Samuel Autman which links Jordan Peele’s “Get Out” to Autman’s experience as a Black, queer journalist surrounded by the omnipresent whiteness and Mormonism of Utah; and “Indescribable” by Carrow Narby who articulates a fascinating exploration of “The Blob” and “Society” in an essay about genderlessness, corporeality and pain, and the pursuit of imperfect intimacies.
Perhaps most compelling, however, is Vallese’s own contribution to the anthology. In it, Vallese interweaves a dissection of “Grace”, a 2009 film about an infant that feeds on human blood, with a moving narrative about queer parenthood. The effect of this is a poignant essay about a gay couple’s journey to create a family intertwined with cinephilic analysis of a cannibalistic baby that, in spite of this seemingly contradictory and macabre content, leaves the reader feeling hopeful and light.
While many of the films discussed are predicated upon the vulnerability of bodies — in conjunction with the purported “monstrosity” of queer and gender nonconforming bodies — there is something undoubtedly resilient about authors using these films as the lens through which to explore their own lives and survival on the page. Many of the authors identify with the werewolves, witches, monsters, and blobs (yes, even blobs) that they write about, finding humanity and commonality in the monstrous, unearthing stories of community and self-discovery in the tales that normally haunt us.
The stakes of this should not be underestimated: “It Came From the Closet” finds value in identifying with the monsters that have historically been used to demonize queer people in film. Yet it does so with incredible success as this identification manages to humanize, deepen, and complicate all involved, alive and fictitious. While an ambitious project — to identify with the monster society has said you are — it is one that the writers of this anthology carry out with grace and skill. Notably, there is very little recognition of these high stakes throughout the anthology, and only one author acknowledges what it would mean for this book to fail: “It’s dangerous, I know, to connect transmasculinity or gender dysphoria with a movie about female self-mutilation,” Jude Ellison S. Doyle writes. “The idea that transmasculine people are self-harming ‘women’ is currently one of the main talking points TERFs (trans-exclusionary radical feminists) use to try to argue us out of existence.”
At its best, this anthology offers captivating personal essays, astute movie analysis, and lyrical prose that expands (and complicates) conceptions of queerness. In the moments it falters, authors rely on a tenuous link between the film they are purportedly discussing and a disconnected personal narrative. These low points are few and far between, however, and the quality of storytelling, prose, and analysis throughout the anthology more than makes up for occasional moments of disjointedness.
“It Came From the Closet” is a compelling read across the board — for those whose childhood was shaped by these cult classics to those whose horror movie consumption ends at the trailer — as much as it is an ambitious project to shift our conceptions of queerness and horror.

William S. Consovoy, an attorney who was a prominent face for conservative causes, died on Monday evening, his law firm Consovoy McCarthy announced on Tuesday. He was 48.
Consovoy had represented anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions since it first filed suit against Harvard in 2014, alleging the University’s admissions practices are “racially and ethnically discriminatory” and violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. He had been scheduled to give oral arguments on behalf of SFFA to the Supreme Court in October, but pulled out just days before to receive brain cancer treatment.
Two lower courts ruled in favor of Harvard, and SFFA appealed the decision to the Supreme Court in 2021. The court heard the case in October and is expected to issue a ruling in the spring or summer of 2023.
In a statement to The Crimson, SFFA founder and president Edward J. Blum called Consovoy a “brilliant legal mind who inspired so many of us to work to achieve the noble goal of equal rights for all Americans.”
“His laughter, wit and generous nature will be missed by his family, colleagues and friends,” Blum wrote.
A former clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas, Consovoy had a long history of serving conservative causes: before SFFA, Blum and Consovoy worked on an anti-affirmative action lawsuit against the University of Texas at Austin and also represented an Alabama county accused of violating the Voting Rights Act, successfully convincing the Supreme Court to overturn portions of the 1965 law. He also represented former President Donald J. Trump in a legal battle with Congress over the release of his tax returns.
The press release from the firm lauded Consovoy’s commitment to his clients and the future of the legal field.
“Will believed passionately in providing every client the highest quality representation, no matter the forum. And he believed just as passionately in providing opportunities for young lawyers to gain experience,” the press release reads.
Consovoy’s law partner, Thomas R. McCarthy, said Consovoy was not only “among the top advocates of his generation,” but was also “the most loyal of friends.”
“Always putting others’ interests before his own, Will went out of his way to help a friend or family member in need,” McCarthy said in the release. “He loved to make other people smile — and loved even more to make them laugh. It is his love, loyalty, and laughter that we will miss most of all.”
Consovoy, whose wife died following a battle with cancer in April 2021, is survived by his parents, stepfather, sister, and niece.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A group of students that sued Harvard for partial reimbursement of tuition after the University moved classes online due to the Covid-19 pandemic reached a settlement with the school, according to a filing by the students’ attorneys in court on Monday.
The plaintiffs’ attorneys wrote in a notice filed in Massachusetts federal court that the “matter has been resolved” and that “a stipulation of voluntary dismissal will be filed shortly.” The terms of the settlement have not been made publicly available.
Daniel J. Kurowski and Spencer M. Cox, attorneys representing the plaintiffs, declined to comment on behalf of the students. Harvard spokesperson Jason A. Newton also declined to comment on the settlement.
The settlement brings to an end nearly three years of legal action against Harvard as students sought tuition compensation from the University for semesters when the Covid-19 pandemic moved classes online.
Harvard Law School student Abraham Barkhordar, School of Public Health student Sarah E. Zelasky, and Graduate School of Education student Ella M. Wechsler-Matthaei initially filed separate complaints in 2020. All three students have since graduated from Harvard.
Zelasky’s complaint, originally filed in May 2020, alleged a “breach of contract” between the University and its students, who had a “reasonable expectation” of in-person learning and living. Barkhordar’s lawsuit alleged a lower quality of education received virtually, as well as decreased academic rigor due to the Law School’s shift to a mandatory pass-fail grading system.
The three plaintiffs later filed a class action lawsuit in August 2020 covering students from all 12 of Harvard’s schools.
Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the University shifted to an online learning model in March 2020 but did not adjust tuition, which students alleged in the lawsuit caused more than $5 million in damages.
Harvard filed a motion to dismiss in October 2020 claiming it “never made a promise, contractual or otherwise” to conduct in-person learning. In June 2021, Massachusetts District Court Judge Indira Talwani ’82 granted the University’s request to dismiss the case.
Massachusetts District Court Judge Angel Kelley reversed Talwani’s dismissal in March 2022 but limited the lawsuit’s scope to students enrolled in the Graduate School of Education, Law School, and School of Public Health during the spring 2020 semester.
Harvard is one of several universities that have faced lawsuits seeking tuition reimbursement for virtual semesters due to the pandemic. In September, Brown University settled a $1.5 million class action lawsuit for tuition and fee refunds.
