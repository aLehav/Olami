The Assembly Row Smoke Shop restaurant is best experienced when there's going to be a football game. Large plasma televisions greet patrons walking in, and they populate the restaurant densely enough that just about every seat has a good view of at least one of them.
Part of this stems from the location’s open, almost cavernous design. It houses a large traditional bar, a lengthy stand-alone bar table, booths along the wall, and spaced-out tables in the middle. The trophy-adorned walls feel miles apart, although the restaurant makes good use of the space with an open kitchen in the center. A section of the ceiling houses a minimalist American flag constructed from colored scrap metal. Overall, the space initially evokes the feeling of being in a warehouse that, while clean and modern, appears similar in style to competing restaurants in the area.
That area, however, is a bit of a hike from Cambridge, especially when the original Smoke Shop is easily accessible in Kendall Square. This reviewer recommends taking an Uber or Lyft to Assembly Row. While biking is an option, your stomach will thank you later for opting to rideshare.
The appetizers adequately prepare you for the upcoming crusade that is the main course. A sturdy yet exquisite pork belly and peaches dish is exclusive to the Assembly Row location. With a large enough appetite, the mac & cheese bites are also worth ordering. The subtle inclusion of spinach to the usual combination of fried cheese and bacon bits is a welcome addition.
The menu tempts patrons with its combination platters. The “Pit Crew” encompasses two meats and two sides, and its “Pit Boss” counterpart ups the ante by providing three meats and three sides. Thinking we could conquer the “Pit Boss," the photographer and I opted for pulled pork, brisket, and ribs as the meats, along with mac & cheese, bacon collards, and cornbread as the sides.
Each meat is exquisite in its own way. The pulled pork is especially noteworthy for its savory skin and overall tenderness. The ribs may pale in comparison, but the brisket, usually cast aside as a fine but inessential barbecue dish, punches well above its weight. The sides (particularly the collards) supplement the main course in the best way possible, offering a respite from the onslaught of meat. The specials are intriguing albeit pricey: Either of the two weekend specials — Saturday’s Big Beef Rib or Sunday’s Baby Back Ribs — will set you back just over $30. Still, the price may be worth it. Even a sliver of the beef rib is enough to leave you wanting more.
Owner and barbecue pitmaster Andy Husbands has also crafted three barbecue sauces that diversify each meat’s flavors: one sweet (but not overwhelming), one spicy (but not overbearing), and one mustard-like (but not overcompensating). These condiments pair well with each of the dishes, providing an extra kick to the meaty backbone of your meal.
After this feast, you no longer feel stuck in a warehouse. The environment around you almost feels religious. Andy Husbands is not interested in pushing barbecue into a new frontier, but rather seeks to worship it as it exists: meats and sides that need not be fancy to be delicious. With this knowledge, the spacious layout of the restaurant signals that you have walked into something akin to a cathedral. The Smoke Shop BBQ’s placement at Assembly Row drives home the devout connection. You are now among the prototypical churchgoers that fill Husbands’ pews on weekends, hungry to share the experience of eating savory barbecue while watching football. It does not matter if you arrive at this restaurant as a believer in the power of his cooking or a skeptic. In the end, provided you fully immerse yourself in the environment around you, you will leave this basilica of barbecue satisfied.

Frankenstein is not the monster. Not literally, anyway — the actual creature remains nameless throughout novel. He also doesn’t have green skin, a rectangular forehead, nor bolts sticking out of his neck. The prevailing representations of Frankenstein often depart from Mary Shelley’s novel, especially in the context of Halloween camp. Central Square Theater’s “Frankenstein,” which will be playing from Oct. 4 to Nov. 4, largely forgoes these misconceptions and closely examines Shelley’s story of Dr. Victor Frankenstein and his creation — but with some unusual twists.
Catalyst Collaborative@MIT’s production brings artists from the Underground Railway Theater and the Nora Theatre Company together with scientists from MIT to present plays that deal with science and technology. Fittingly, scholars often interpret Shelley’s work as a cautionary response to 19th century scientific advances, which makes the story more relevant than ever in a time when personal technology has an unfathomably strong grasp on each of our lives. Although Shelley first published “Frankenstein: or, The Modern Prometheus” exactly two centuries ago, director David R. Gammonds and playwright Nick Dear have adapted the story in order to best reflect its chilling relevance to modern day.
Gammonds’ directorial choice to have all six actors play the Creature adds depth and insight to Shelley’s story. Each versatile actor in “Frankenstein” portrays multiple characters: One or more human characters, as well as the Creature. Three to five actors play the monster at any given time, all swaying together in a collectively tortured and violent blob. This suggests that everyone has a little of the Creature inside of them, emphasizing the hypocrisy of the human characters who reject him. While popular scholarly interpretations posits Dr. Frankenstein as the only monster, Gammonds goes beyond this to paint the other humans in the novel such as the Delacey family as brutes, emphasizing their cruelty towards the Creature, even though the family acts as if they are simply victims of the Creature’s violence.
The costume design in “Frankenstein” also strives to represent the Creature that resides within all of us. Throughout the play, the actors wear all white, but when they portray humans, they wear an article of neon clothing — perhaps a futuristic dress or fluorescent shawl — on top of their white outfits. This suggests that the only difference between the monster and the humans that persecute him is a superficial piece of fabric, adding a slightly heavy-handed layer of richness to the story.
While Dear’s adapted script modernizes the novel, it lacks the work’s sophistication. Dear changed the plot of “Frankenstein” in a variety of ways, such as Dr. Frankenstein creating a female monster and changing the relationship between Agatha and Felix to that of lovers rather than siblings. For the most part, these changes do not interfere with the true story of the novel “Frankenstein.” What disrupted the story instead was the loss of Shelley’s graceful, flowery prose into a dumbed down translation from the page to the stage, such that the Creature’s coming-of-age felt a bit contrived and melodramatic and the relationship between Agatha and Felix resembled a corny rom-com. The play lost all the wonderful elements that make the original such an iconic gothic novel.
“Frankenstein” combined an extremely accessible script with a comparatively abstract and avant-garde presentation to create a production that enhanced some understandings of Shelley’s novel, but failed to live up to the original in terms of style. However, this production reflects impressive thoughtfulness in interpreting this novel on a level far above the typical “Frankenstein” Halloween play.

The trans electronic pop star SOPHIE only recently gained physical form.
Since 2013, she has made her name as an affiliate of the label and collective PC Music, a London-based group of electronic producers and vocalists. For most of her career, SOPHIE was ferociously anonymous. Her face, name, past, and identity remained hidden. But in 2017, she materialized, and since then her art has begged to be understood in the context of her now public transness.
Investigating SOPHIE thus allows us to ask: How can transness be represented, embodied, and manifested in art? This question takes on special significance in an aesthetic landscape where transness has entered the art of the Academy and the museum, from prestige films (Tom Hooper’s “The Danish Girl”) to literature (Maggie Nelson’s “The Argonauts”), where trans identity and definition is explored from within the confines of high art. SOPHIE’s art reveals another, richer possibility for trans aesthetics, a possibility rooted in low art.
The archetypal case of low art is that global phenomenon of banality called pop music. The theorist Theodor Adorno accuses pop music of the most grievous aesthetic sin: “standardization.” Pop music consists of a spare set of eternally repeated clichés, tropes, and structures. The pop song is a formula, devoid of originality and creativity. It is a realm where, to quote Adorno, “nothing fundamentally novel will be introduced.”
Understanding pop music as formulaic rests on a notion that high art exists for beauty and low art exists for pleasure. Beauty is understood as beyond human needs and desires and impulses. If beauty is a Cezanne nude — any art lover would surely be horrified at the notion of a museum goer ever being sexually aroused by such a work — then pleasure is pornography: biological, weak-willed, and mechanical. Low art, made purely for pleasure, relies on the mechanical formulas of standardization designed to please the consumer.
As a site of pure pleasure, pop music is assumed to have no political purpose, even as transness asserts itself in the world of high art. Why is pleasure discarded so? The philosopher and poet Audre Lorde has one suggestion: The erasure of pleasure is a symptom of a racist, patriarchal system of gender. In this system, one that emphasizes the rational male mind over the irrational female body, pleasure becomes a fugitive state, a dangerous source of resistance to formations of power that seek to control and own bodies.
Transess is that most radical assertion that gender will never be enough, that the entire project of gender ought to be destroyed. Transness is transgressive. Gender is a schema that is forced upon bodies against their will. The reduction of femme bodies to sexual objects on every street corner, the policing of the male body, the forcing of the intersex body into one or the other. Transness is the resistance against such incidents of enforced engendering. It is an assertion that what matters is not what others see, but how one feels.
SOPHIE embraces this most radical potential of transness: the evasion, escape, destruction of gender. This power of transness, this freedom it brings, is found in the pleasure offered by low art.
While SOPHIE’s art undeniably showcases profound creativity (her sonic landscapes are wholly self-constructed, emptied of any kind of familiarity), it uncannily locates itself within the pleasure project of pop music. As her track “BIPP” promises, “I can make you feel better.”
Take the penultimate track on SOPHIE’s debut album, “Immaterial.” The song is unabashedly a pop song. The thudding bass, the auto-tuned vocals, and the punching chorus are all designed to ensure the listener’s complete and utter absorption in the song, in pure pleasure. Out of this banality of pop, SOPHIE constructs a secret haven, a hidden home for all those whose gender has become their prison. For in pleasure, the gendered body becomes concerned not with the judging gaze of its audience, but with itself. Pleasure allows for, in Lorde’s words, the sensation of “It feels right to me.”
When the gaze of others is thus rejected, what can gender do but dissipate? When you lose yourself — lose yourself! — in “Immaterial,” in the sheer pleasure it revitalizes, can you not feel wisps of the self drifting away? The pure pleasure that SOPHIE provides allows one to transcend concerns with how others see one, how one fits within the schemas into which they have been thrown against their will. In transcending the schemas of gender, the body becomes putty for hormone supplements and corrective surgery. In this way, the embrace of pleasure as “It feels right to me” manifests paradoxically as a dematerialization. The given body is surrendered, rejected, escaped, and one drifts, immaterial, to the heavens.
SOPHIE’s aesthetics are built on such dematerialization. Her use of vocal and visual avatars, her disappearances and anonymity, her commitment to decentering herself from her art — these features do more than speak to any personal aversion to publicity. They demonstrate a commitment to a trans aesthetics that proclaims: “With no name and with no type of story, Where do I live? Tell me, where do I exist?” This desire for immateriality, an identity utterly unmoored from the weight of gender, rests on the ultimate power of pleasure as that most isolating and releasing promise of transness.
In SOPHIE’s low art, the promise of Auntie Walker is fulfilled: Freedom from the forces of race, gender, the body, is in fact possible. SOPHIE grants us that freedom in a trans aesthetics of immateriality. This aesthetic is an embrace of the singular moment on that grimy, sweaty dance floor, where the world falls away and what remains is a single urge, flesh and bones and heavy gender burning away like mist under a strobe light.
And in that ugly space, we live out SOPHIE’s words:
“I can be anything I want.”

—Contributing writer Nicholas P. Whittaker’s column, "Low End Theory,” digs deep into the archive of bad, taboo, and ugly art, seeking political liberation in the low.

The Huntington Theatre Company’s production “Sherlock’s Last Case” is a snarky comedy packed full of unexpected moments that test the legendary duo of detective Sherlock Holmes and his partner Dr. John Watson. When Sherlock Holmes (Rufus Collins) receives a mysterious letter from the late Professor Moriarty’s supposed son, he must solve yet another mystery to preserve his reputation and prevent his own murder. Written by Charles Marowitz and directed by Maria Aitken, the play will run from Sept. 28 to Oct. 28.
Sherlock and Watson (Mark Zeisler) first take to the stage in their famous Baker Street flat, where they launch into hilarious, tongue-in-cheek quips that are the perfect compliment to the dangerous case at hand. The most comedic moments mock the overplayed tropes found in Conan’s Sherlock works, yet reinforce the British humor that makes this detective so unique. Watson is a foil to Sherlock, particularly when it comes to Sherlock’s cold calculating nature. Watson is instead quite warm and respectful, as shown by his treatment of Mrs. Hudson (Jane Ridley), to whom he generously lends his car to aid her in her distant visit to a relative. Inspector Lestrade (Malcolm Ingram) is equally charming as he bumbles along in service of the Crown while also providing aid to Sherlock’s firm after Sherlock disappears. Liza Moriarty (Antoinette Robinson) is outstandingly comical as she stirs Sherlock’s desires and further mystifies the case.
The set is particular well done. The Baker Street flat is marvelously constructed with the hauntingly silent cuckoo clock in the background, in which a framed silhouette of Sherlock wrapped by a wreath appears later. The set does a good job of contextualizing Sherlock’s character by displaying esoteric items around the space to show his interests. Scenes in the mill basement have claustrophobic wooden beams surrounding the stage and a sinister chair which all work together to create a grim atmosphere. The costume design is also spot on, with Sherlock’s archetypal detective garbs and Liza’s beautiful blue dress as standouts through the numerous costume changes. The small leather tobacco bag and iconic pipe add to the authenticity. Altogether, this creates a wonderful reimagining of a play written over 30 years ago.
Although at times the play pokes fun at its own ridiculousness, such as in a scene involving a trained pigeon, it often feels weighed down by its reinforcement of traditional gender roles, outdated jabs, and references characteristic of its Victorian period during which it is set. Some of the most disconcerting lines are centered on the brutal rape of a girl by a rebuffed suitor. Other scenes involve unnecessary antiquated insults that are masqueraded as banter between the two main characters, all of which are ultimately both problematic and unnecessary. Nevertheless, it's a compelling interpretation of Sherlock Holmes at the height of his fame and the society he represented.
Even with its missteps, “Sherlock’s Last Case” is a brilliant performance by the entire cast that revives the beloved partnership for another thrilling adventure. Overall, the set and costume designs particularly bring to life the myth of Sherlock. Sherlock’s precise wit and sarcasm once again cannot be outsmarted, in this truly gripping production.

In the 1970s, changing the radio station was more than just the turn of a dial. It was a choice between music legends. A turn one way split a listener between Earth, Wind & Fire and Elton John, the other between Bob Dylan and David Bowie. The airways were saturated with artists revolutionizing their genres and nowhere was this more salient than in rock music. The year 1975 was characterized by a series of rock album releases that defined careers, pushed boundaries, and inspired musicians for generations to come.
July 1975: Fleetwood Mac’s “Fleetwood Mac”
The history of Fleetwood Mac is one defined as much by its members as by the music they created. It was in 1975 that the band released the eponymous album that propelled them to commercial and critical success, their first with the addition of musical (and romantic) duo Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks. Tracks like “Rhiannon” and “Landslide” showcased Nicks’ vocals and songwriting skills, as well as established the pop-rock feel the band would perfect on 1977’s “Rumours,” largely considered one of the best albums of all time. The group’s lengthy “Fleetwood Mac” tour contributed significantly to the historic romantic turmoil of the band’s members, defining its follow-up in substance as well as style.
August 1975: Bruce Springsteen’s “Born to Run”
Bruce Springsteen (aka “The Boss”) first staked his claim to fame with the release of his third studio album “Born to Run.” Beloved by critics but ignored by the public, Springsteen and the E Street Band began work on what would be their ticket from New Jersey to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame with one thing in mind: commercial success. Designed for maximum mass appeal, their effort proved a success, reaching number three on the Billboard 200. The Boss’s signature rasp, musical complexity, and penchant for narrative lyrics took over the radio, his lifelong staying-power certainly making up for the extra year or few it took to get there.
September 1975: Pink Floyd’s “Wish You Were Here”
While performers in the U.S. and U.K. gravitated toward hard and heavy-metal rock, a select group of British bands took up the waning torch of ’60s psychedelic and blues-rockers in the form of progressive rock. While Pink Floyd’s “The Dark Side of the Moon” (1973) is arguably the best known album from this period, 1975’s “Wish You Were Here” is a 5 track gem of an album that captivated music lovers on both sides of The Pond. The album’s whining synthesizers and saxophone, most notably on the 26 minute, 2 part behemoth track “Shine On You Crazy Diamond,” gave it a distinctly languid feel suitable for the melancholic tribute to founder Syd Barrett they conceived it to be.
November 1975: Queen’s “A Night at the Opera”
The British band Queen, helmed by the iconic Freddie Mercury, released 7 albums between 1973 and 1978, cementing their place forever in any and all conversations on and characterizations of rock music during the decade. Their 1975 release “A Night at the Opera” proved to be their most experimental and successful album yet, drifting fluidly between genres and musical styles and taking cues from progressive rock (“Death On Two Legs (Dedicated to…)”), the ballad (“Love of My Life”), and — notoriously — opera (“Bohemian Rhapsody”). The last of the three, “Bohemian Rhapsody,” reached an unpredicted level of ubiquity and became a microcosm for the band’s diverse musical influences, talent, and unrivaled theatricality. While it’s fair to say every album on this list has been named “one of the best albums of all time,” “A Night at the Opera” is in a league of its own.
December 1975: Patti Smith’s “Horses” 
A groundbreaking combination of music, poetry, and aesthetics picked up during her years in New York City’s artistic underground, Patti Smith’s “Horses” defined American punk rock music. What it lacked in commercial success, the album made up in critical adoration and in its lasting legacy. Tracks like “Birdland” and “Land: Horses / Land of a Thousand Dancers / La Mer(de)” incorporated selections of Smith’s spoken word poetry, seamlessly placed between chunks of frantic, garage-band instrumentation, while a smooth reggae beat undercut “Redondo Beach’s” layered tale of finding a body on the beach. A trailblazing effort by Smith, “Horses” created a punk rock frenzy around the globe and served as inspiration for the likes of “R.E.M.” and “The Smiths.”

While enshrined sitcom classics like “Seinfeld” and “Friends” spin colorful tales out of the mundane, “30 Rock” episodes are special in that they’re aggressively absurd. Each is a whirlwind, a screwball adventure packed with wisecracks that’ll whiz by if you don’t pay careful attention. “30 Rock” creator Tina Fey plays Liz Lemon, the head writer for a straggling NBC sketch show called “The Girlie Show” and is prone to moralizing displays at the local hotdog cart (line-cutters, beware). Liz isn’t a great person, like most other characters on the show. The “30 Rock” creators have peopled this world with a host of venal characters whom you wouldn’t want to befriend, but whose internal dynamics function as magically as a Rube Goldberg machine. “30 Rock” plays irreverently with the act of presentation: This world is outrageous, but because of our watchful eye and the mediation of the fourth wall, the zany (and sometimes offensive) elements of the show amount to a mockery of our foolish human tendencies. That being said, the inimitable combination of physical comedy and mordant wit that Tina Fey employs so consistently makes choosing these five episodes excruciatingly difficult.
1. “Black Tie” (Season One, Episode Twelve)
Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), Liz’s boss, invites her to accompany him to a lavish party celebrating the 25th birthday of his friend, Prince Gerhardt Hapsburg (Paul Reubens). Jenna (Jane Krakowski), TGS’s resident diva and Liz’s egotistical best-friend, gets her to think that Jack asked her out romantically, a notion that he gleefully dashes. The way Reubens animates the body that the writers have bestowed upon him, a product of centuries of inbreeding, is a tour-de-force performance in itself. Jenna, fancying herself a modern Grace Kelly, sneaks into the party and enjoys a romance with Gerhardt that ends in champagne-related calamity. Jack runs into his glamorous and temperamental ex-wife (Isabella Rossellini), who flies into a rage when Liz and Jack pretend to be a happy couple. The drama that ensues, like an initiation ritual, lays a stone in the mosaic of Jack and Liz’s friendship — they’ll have each other’s backs, even if it costs Liz some hair.
2. “Do-Over” (Season Three, Episode One)
Every time I watch “30 Rock” and declare one episode supremely insane, the next episode does the other one better. This episode exemplifies the “30 Rock” brand of humor that shocks without relying on vulgarity, with elliptical plots that, like fun house mirrors, twist and warp situations in unexpected directions. Liz decides she’s ready to adopt a child, so Bev from the adoption agency visits her workplace to interview her co-workers on Liz’s viability as a prospective parent. The visit goes spectacularly awry, as expected. When Bev winds up with a head injury and forgets everything she has seen and learned about Liz, she affords Liz a do-over that seems to go as successfully as it possibly could, until it doesn’t.
3. “Apollo, Apollo” (Season Three, Episode Sixteen)
Liz and Jenna feud once she finds out that Jenna once slept with Liz’s deadbeat boyfriend, beeper salesman Dennis Duffy (Dean Winters) after he enrolls in a sex addiction recovery program and must apologize to his former sexual partners. But the episode’s most resonant throughline is Jack and Liz’s. Jack watches home videos in anticipation of his 50th birthday, vexed by the knowledge that despite his superficial success, he won’t ever again be so happy that he could vomit, as he did when he was a toddler. He comes to realize that Liz and the ridiculous entanglements that are almost contractual requisites of their relationship bring him the greatest joy. In this case, his saving grace is an old phone sex commercial that Liz did as a ridiculously coiffed “Bijou.”
4. “Queen of Jordan” (Season Five, Episode Seventeen)
This episode takes the form of “Queen of Jordan,” a reality show brought to us by Angie (Sherri Shepherd), the domineering wife of movie star Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) who is dropping a new single titled “My Single is Dropping.” It’s a delightful send-up of reality show theatrics with captions like “Pete, Powerless Bald” that accompany the talking heads, and with reality show staples like a snappy entourage, weave-pullings by Angie, and wine-throwing by Jenna. The “30 Rock” writers somehow manage to stitch an emotional undercurrent into this ludicrously wacky episode, as Angie’s concerns about her and Tracy’s relationship underlie the glossy artifice of her show. She shares her husband’s gift for acting out to the inconvenience of everyone around her, and Tracy frequents strip clubs to hype himself up to go home to her. Their relationship is probably the strongest on the show. “30 Rock” is ultimately about unconventional and non-intuitive ways to have successful relationships — in Season Seven, Liz grapples with the gender-normative expectations of parenthood as a stay-at-home mom.
5. “Leap Day” (Season Six, Episode Nine)
Legend has it that every Leap Day, Leap Day William emerges from the Mariana Trench to trade children’s tears for candy and to encourage us to live a little. Everyone but Liz is religious about the holiday, and Kenneth (Jack McBrayer), the preternaturally upbeat NBC page, dresses in Leap Day William’s signature blue and yellow to shower candy upon the writers. When Liz runs into Thad (Steve Little) from college, formerly the nerdy “skin tag lad,” now an Internet billionaire, he confesses his longtime crush on her and proposes that she take his virginity for $20 million. An overworked Jack is forced to re-evaluate his life when he has a bad dream after eating rhubarb leaves (it’s a Leap Day tradition to eat rhubarb). Meanwhile, Tracy manages to spend his $50,000 Benihana gift card. If we learn anything from Leap Day, a day when the rules and limitations of the universe no longer apply (as if that were not already the case on “30 Rock”), it’s that we should “live every day as if it’s Leap Day, and every Leap Day as if it’s your last.”

“Adventures in New America” is absurd. The podcast is listed on Spotify as “the first sci-fi, political satire, Afro-futuristic buddy comedy,” and, according to this definition, it doesn’t disappoint. The world of New America is a strange one — a land culturally stuck in the 1950s with the technology of today and the politics of the future. The podcast radically comments on racial tensions, the meaning of the black experience, and the healthcare crisis while concurrently introducing the hidden value of 1982 pennies and Tetchy Terrorist Vampire Zombies from outer space. With all of these elements competing for space, it’s easy to see where the show could fall flat or overwhelm its audience. However, creators Tristan Cowen and Stephen Winter, who also voices character IA Olivier, funnel these divergent themes into an engaging podcast that has the potential to make a powerful social commentary.
The podcast follows two characters — IA Olivier, a black man who simply cannot get arrested despite his impassioned attempts, and Simon Carr (Paige Gilbert), a lesbian self-described sneak-thief — as the pair work together to collect the money for IA’s medical expenses. The premiere introduced the characters and established detailed world-building for later episodes. While we are given hints about how New America differs from our own America with the strange penny commercials, Techty Terrorist Vampire Zombie attacks, and oddly behaved policemen, these elements aren’t present enough to distract us from the character driven episode plot of the two personalities meeting. Winter and Cowen stretch our belief but don’t break it, keeping the rules within the world consistent, promising more information as the series continues and maintaining an immersive experience throughout the first episode.
However, the pilot of Adventures in New America surpasses absurdity into discomfort at times. Right after a strange penny commercial at the start of the episode, the listener is thrown into a scene where a few Tetchy Terrorist Vampire Zombies ambush and devour a black vocalist. The scene is made all the more disturbing by the overt racialization of the attack. One Tetchy Terrorist Vampire Zombie refers to their victim as “society’s trash” because of her blackness and remarking that by eating her they would be “doing the world a favor.” New America may be a different world but its creators drew inspiration from the inequalities, societal tensions, and racism within our own and blew it up to a disconcerting scale. While Cowen and Winter certainly make their point in this and similar scenes, they straddle the line between necessary and gratuitous hyperbole.
“Adventures in New America” will turn heads and start conversation, not only because of the show’s embrace of the absurd but also because of its desire to make a clear social statement and explore the black identity today. It has a lot to cover, but from the first episode it is clear that Cowen and Winter are masters in worldbuilding who can pull the discordant aspects of New America into one unified story as the series unfolds.

There, I am powerful — one of the most powerful in any room, even. I am the white woman, often the accomplice of the white man, but sometimes — many times — subject to his whims, and even his abuse.
Aside from my womanhood, my kind is King. I am still Brown, still Muslim, still This Me. But I am also light-skinned (more Wheatish than Brown), Sunni (not Shia, or worse, Ahmadi), Urdu-speaking, and English-speaking too, not Punjabi-speaking, Sindhi-speaking, Pashto-speaking; no populist provincial language graces my urban tongue.
I have all the trappings of a woman of my class: Somebody does my cooking and washing, a dog guards my expansive green gate, and a guard — a man this time, armed and uniformed — protects me and my kind from the majority. And I have various uncles and grandfathers in the army and government protecting me and my kind from any injustice.

Here, I am Pakistani-Muslim-immigrant-woman Me. I have risen here, though. I have become the semi-white-woman.
From an F-1 wielding visa dependent, my father pursuing his heavily subsidized MBA, my college-educated mother working under the table as a babysitter to our apartment-complex neighbors, as a cashier in the Arab grocery shop, salesperson at the Persian rug store, deliverer of food at the Chinese restaurant.
What began as a troop-of-four occupying a three-room, one-story apartment, bus-riding over the Indiana hills, became a family-of-four in an Upper East Side apartment overlooking the river, subway-riding, sometimes cab-indulging, private college-attending, software-engineering, Wall Street-working, art-pursuing.

There, I am standing at the bottom of the winding stairs when I see that he is halfway down the steps already. He immediately presses his body against the tall white wall, clearing the way for me to go past him without the slightest possibility of us touching. I tell him to go ahead, he shakes his head, No, and I waft past him, him, who waits until I reach the top of the landing before proceeding to the bottom.
This is white-woman-me, and dark-skinned, village-hailing him, him, one of five servants in a Lahori home.
***
Here, I am standing in the American embassy, Paris, dream-of-a-summer ending with the nightmare of Green Card stolen, a red-faced man telling me, on second thought, not to come back tomorrow. If the bright GREEN of my passport does not change things, the crescent moon and star, the “Islamic Republic of,” certainly does.
He does not know when they will be able to issue me the document that I need to go home.
Yes, he knows the website says 24 to 48 hours.
No, he cannot comment on whether the extra security checks are because I am Pakistani-Muslim-immigrant-woman: Me!
I start to cry.
It is $600 for the stamp, would be $600 more for a new Green Card, it is thousands of dollars spent on missed flights.
***
Here, I am the white woman unsettled, displaced to a netherland where I no longer have the white-woman-anonymity I used to, but still have enough economic and cultural and educational capital to pass. I am too light-skinned to present too much of a problem to most, my uncovered head proving to passerby that I do not pose The Threat, my bare legs proving that I have Thoroughly Assimilated. And anyway, I am too pretty to be a nuisance, made fetish instead, made occasional indulgence of the White Man who wants variety instead, made token Brown member of the elite college society instead.
Here, the White Man wants me to believe that I am white enough to be accepted, to identify with Him, to forsake the Black Man and remember who I was There. It is more convenient for me and my kind to side with the White Man, convenient especially for Him, who can then turn to the Black Man and say:
If They can succeed, why can’t you? They come here with nothing, but They work hard, They study hard, They become college graduates and entrepreneurs and sometimes even CEOs!
If those Asians can do it, why can’t you?
And then, us: bringing the colorism from our home countries with us, carrying the very resources that allowed us to immigrate in the first place, giddy to be allowed such proximity to whiteness, believing that Yes, of course we are better. We have pulled ourselves up by those fabled bootstraps! We have studied and worked ourselves to near death for this success! We have achieved the American Dream!
Us, we turn to the Black Man and say:
If we can do it, why can’t you?
***
Here, I am tired of the selfish choice we make to allow our Brownness and Yellowness to fade, to have inched toward Whiteness when the White Man decided it was beneficial for Him, when we decided it was easier to accept our newfound social status, when we decided it was easier to blame the Black Man for his failure and accept the praise so kindly thrown our way, the praise that has manifested in the Model Minority Myth that is apparently so damn painful because it isn’t true and we’re not ALL the quiet smart Asian, but somehow, even if it isn’t true, we’ve earned our success and the Black Man has earned his failure.
I am tired of our sustained devotion to the God of Silence. Of our belief that if we are just quiet enough, just unnoticed enough, just hard-working enough, Society will drain us of our melanin, realize that we are not like those Blacks or those Mexicans.
***
There, I am thoroughly uncomfortable, and Here, I am thoroughly confused. There and Here, I am unsettled by my own privileges. I want acceptance, but I cannot possibly live with it, either.
I cannot help but Remember that we were once systematically excluded from entering this country, once put in concentration camps, once a colonized people, that now, we are being tortured in the name of national security.
I cannot help but Remember that We are not White, and that being proximal to Whiteness, accepting this privilege, allows Us to be weaponized against Black America.
I refuse your “gift” of Semi-Whiteness.
—Contributing writer Minahil A. Khan’s column, “Unlearning, Decolonizing,” navigates the landscape of identity in her journey as a Brown Muslim immigrant woman decolonizing her psyche. Through personal narrative, it will explore the vacillation between self-love and self-hate, relationships with one’s family and cultural as well as religious communities, and the homeland, both imagined and lived.

There are few female poets so emblematic as Emily Dickinson, the spinster-poetess-recluse of Amherst, Massachusetts, whose work achieved enormous posthumous recognition and an indisputable spot in the American canon, yet whose life has been portrayed as tormented, lonely and timid.  “Wild Nights with Emily,” screened as part of the inaugural 2018 Boston Women’s Film Festival, rewrites the entrenched narrative of Dickinson’s life in a radical and refreshing way while exposing the challenges faced by female creators, many of which seem especially resonant in the year of the #MeToo movement.
What is most remarkable about this film is not only the revelation of Emily Dickinson’s lifelong love affair with her next door neighbor, Susan Dickinson (Susan Ziegler), who — yes — was actually Emily’s sister-in-law, but particularly writer and director Madeleine Olnek’s roster of exceptionally nuanced female characters. The ambitious, unreliable narrator Mabel Todd (Amy Seimetz), lover of Dickinson’s brother’s husband and driving force behind the ultimate publication and success of Emily’s poetry after her death, is at once a paragon of female ambition and an example of the huge barriers faced by female authors in and after Dickinson’s time. Fabricating a more societally acceptable personal history for Emily — the spinster narrative with which we are all familiar — Mabel at last gets Emily Dickinson’s work into the spotlight, earning accolades from the very industry that rejected that poetry during the author’s life, but in so doing erases all evidence of Dickinson’s muse, Susan, from the poetry, even literally taking rubber to page to remove Susan’s name from poems in the moments after Dickinson’s death.
In a film with obvious heroines in both Dickinson and her childhood friend, Susan Gilbert, Mabel is a villain with the viewer’s sympathy when it would have been easy to paint her as just another mean girl. It is interesting how the film conveys the idea that when options are limited for one woman, they are limited for all women, as when Mabel must rely on Dickinson’s blundering-idiot of a brother as an entrée to publishers although she is clearly the more visionary of the pair.
The film is a wry comedy at times approaching absurdity, such as when the lovers race between their neighboring homes, clutching layer upon layer of petticoats and bloomers lest they be discovered. Yet the film is also punctuated by moments of poignancy, from the first bloom of love between the girls at a Ladies’ Shakespeare Society meeting to the myriad deliveries of half-inked love poems on scraps of paper sent from Emily to Susan.
The film, despite its hilarity, strikes a sober note about the losses Emily and Susan feel due to the clandestine nature of their relationship due to societal prejudice against gay people. Not knowing that Susan herself is grieving following Emily’s death, Dickinson’s siblings ask Susan to bathe Emily’s body as they are too aggrieved to take on the task. The arresting imagery of Susan cleaning Emily’s body, unable to lay claim to the secret grief that threatens to overwhelm her, effectively parallels the imagery of Mabel erasing Susan’s name from Emily’s private writings in a gut-wrenching way. Thankfully for Emily and Susan, their long-lost love story must no longer be hidden away, and Susan’s name has been replaced in the letters (many of which are now housed in Harvard’s Houghton Library) with the assistance of infrared technology to detect the original writing erased by Mabel Todd. Muse and poet, resigned to silence by the mores of a different age, are at last reunited in writing and history to encourage the love and lettering of a new generation of women.

Starting in 2015, six volunteers participated in an elaborate space mission simulation for an entire year, pretending to be the first astronauts to land on Mars. They lived in a cramped little dome on the rocky terrain of Mauna Loa, a volcano in Hawai’i, which mimics the surface of the red planet. There were two main rules for their roleplay: (1) Never step outside without a spacesuit, and (2) outside air will kill you without a spacesuit. As far-fetched as this concept sounds, this is not a blurb off of a sci-fi novel but an actual, ongoing study orchestrated by NASA to better prepare for future space exploration. In Gimlet Media’s recent podcast, “The Habitat,” the fourth mission in the HI-SEAS (Hawai’i Space Exploration Analog and Simulation) project takes center stage.
To tell the inside story of what life was like for the volunteers – Carmel Johnston, the commander; Andrzej Stewart, the engineer; Christiane Heinicke and Cyprien Verseux, the European scientists; Shey Gifford, the doctor; Tristan Bassingthwaighte, the architect – during their Mars simulation, science journalist Lynn Levy produced a podcast series called “The Habitat,” which examines human relationships under the strain of shared isolation in an amusingly novel way.
A significant portion of “The Habitat” takes the form of the narrative, and like any tale, it’s only as good as the storyteller, no matter how captivating the subject matter itself may be. In the first episode, “This is the Way Up,” Levy assumes the tone of a commentator in a nature documentary, enunciating words carefully and conveying little emotion. Her lack of genuine excitement makes the delivery of both personal anecdotes and supposed “fun” facts about the mission fall flat. Given that her narration is meant to introduce important figures and transition between audio clips, Levy’s low energy not only affects the listener’s reception of the project’s backstory, but also colors our perception of the volunteers and their dialogue with soporific dullness.
However, despite its shaky takeoff, “The Habitat” manages to launch out of this world with the second episode. “Every Day Goes by Faster and Faster” is exponentially more engaging, partly due to the introduction of vlog-sounding segments that peek into the daily life of the HI-SEAS crew, with audio recordings that range from precisely 30-second-long showers to the sound of munching on freeze-dried peaches. The quick switches between the different voices and personalities of the volunteers ensure that the flow of the podcast is never lagging. The conversational speech and ambient sounds (of breakfast sizzling in a pan or approaching footsteps) in the recordings from the dome are highly immersive, creating a fly-on-the-wall listening experience in contrast to the detached atmosphere of the first episode.
Another major contributor to the improvement of the second episode is Levy’s development of a quirky edge to her previously bland persona. At one point, she inserts a clip of her attempt to cook dehydrated turkey chunks just to satisfy her curiosity about the taste of astronaut food. Levy also shows off a new affinity for choosing interesting anecdotes from space missions and finding the perfect places to insert them. Case in point: Following Bassingthwaighte’s account of how he unclogged a composting toilet that failed to make neat blocks of fertilizer from the team’s waste, Levy details some mishaps from the Apollo program involving “an escaped poop nugget, freed from the bounds of gravity” with gleeful immaturity. Her more relaxed, lighthearted style of narration transforms the overall mood of the podcast from that of a droning professor’s lecture to that of a cool summer camp counselor.
By this point, “The Habitat” also effectively investigates its central question about how people react to living in prolonged isolation together in a way that simultaneously offers a reality-TV-like plot structure that maximizes audience investment. The audio clips in the second episode are organized to first insinuate strained relationships, using a series of soundbites about the challenging living conditions, then ending with narration about the new traditions shared across the dome after the volunteers overcame hardships together.
“The Habitat” is a program that is initially attractive for its crazy, futuristic premise, but soon becomes more enjoyable for the interpersonal dynamics of the HI-SEAS team and the reveal of surprisingly unglamorous parts of astronaut life. While the premiere of the podcast feels overly self-conscious and tedious due to a slow-moving plot and dull narration, stick around for at least the second episode. As Levy and the cast of volunteers settle more comfortably into their personalities, “The Habitat” becomes an impressive bridge between the best parts of reality TV (hearing the daily drama of very different people being forced to live together) and documentary (getting answers to your craziest questions about space that were too inappropriate to ask in class).

Even if Kanye West had left his MAGA hat at home, his appearance on “Saturday Night Live” would have given us plenty to discuss. Specifically, I want to talk about the troll-like nature of Kanye’s performance of “I Love It” (featuring rapper Lil Pump and a sample from comedian Adele Givens), which seemed devoted to confounding/disappointing/making a mockery of expectations.
First of all, host Adam Driver only named Kanye in his introduction (“ladies and gentlemen, Kanye West”), but the first half of the performance — over a full minute — featured only Lil Pump as a lead vocalist, with Kanye merely dancing and offering occasional ad libs. What better way to troll the audience than by announcing “Kanye West” and then giving a performance that is at least 50 percent not Kanye West? But the trolling only grew more troll-some from there.
I haven’t mentioned, for instance, the fact that both rappers performed in costume as oversized barely-off-brand water bottles, Lil Pump as Fiji and Kanye as S. Pellegrino. The costumes were not complete non-sequiturs –– “I Love It” references “sparkling or still,” and the track’s music video features Kanye and Lil Pump dressed in similarly oversized suits –– but their absurdity and apparent lack of subtlety or deeper meaning felt deeply troll-esque.
Finally, there was the censoring of certain lyrics, which, while predictable (NBC’s censors generally keep curse words out of SNL broadcasts), so fundamentally altered the song — the central hook is “you’re such a fucking ho,” after all –– that it came across as another bait and switch. Just as the performance billed as “Kanye West” was revealed to be a Lil Pump/Adele Givens/absurd costumes spectacle with a Kanye cameo, the song billed as “I Love It” was performed in a comically deconstructed form, sometimes evoking Flight of the Conchords’ “Mutha’uckas” as much as the original “I Love It” recording. In Kanye’s verse, the vulgar but comprehensible “I’m a sick fuck, I like a quick fuck” became the lazy and nonsensical “I’m a real freak, I need a real freak.”
At the same time, though, curse-less lyrics referencing sex and drugs were left in, like Givens’s joke about faking orgasms, Lil Pump’s line about “sippin’ drank,” and Kanye’s “the condom slipped up.” In this way, Kanye trolled both those in the audience who were hoping for an unadulterated performance of his song and those who were hoping for “clean” entertainment (although those people should know better than to watch SNL), delivering a performance that was consistent with the spirit of neither. And for good measure, he threw in a “scoop!” ad lib, in a seeming reference to “Lift Yourself,” his single from this spring which itself has been widely interpreted as a troll.
Kanye’s peak musical years may be behind him, and his politics may be controversial and incoherent, but his troll game has perhaps never been stronger.

Amazon’s “The Romanoffs” represents the latest big bet in the battle over streaming content, with a budget of $50 million for the first season alone, a star-studded cast, and Matthew Weiner of AMC’s “Mad Men” directing. The anthology series will follow fictional descendants of the House of Romanov, the Russian royal family from 1613 until 1917, who are now scattered across the globe and must adjust to dwindling wealth and status.
Episode One finds smooth-talking American womanizer Greg (Aaron Eckhart) and his social climbing French girlfriend Sophie (Louise Bourgoin) living paycheck-to-paycheck in Paris, currying favor with Greg’s aunt Anushka (Marthe Keller) in the hope of inheriting her palatial apartment. Anushka is a bitter, racist hypochondriac and descendant of the Romanoffs, who lives alone surrounded by old family heirlooms and fires a new maid every week. Hajar (Inès Melab), an implacable young Muslim woman putting herself through school, is the maid agency’s last resort. Though Anushka initially treats Hajar with contempt, Hajar’s resolve and attentiveness win her over, and their friendship places Greg and Sophie’s schemes in jeopardy. The premiere of “The Romanoffs” is tonally inconsistent with a weak ending, but it makes up for its shortcomings with strong performances, especially by Eckhart and Keller.
Greg, more complicated and ruthless than the easygoing charmer he pretends to be, is a meaty role for Eckhart. He shines opposite Keller’s Anushka, who is the perfect foil for his insincerity: Greg, always schmoozing and feigning interest, plays the concerned nephew well — but not well enough that his intentions are unclear — and Anushka is ultimately too lonely to care. After Greg’s mask comes off for a few seconds when he is alone in a restroom, Eckhart’s choices and actions reveal hidden nuance.
Keller’s performance is likewise quite effective. When Anushka is taken to the hospital following a mild fainting spell, she asks the ambulance driver to slow down that she might “see the Arc De Triomphe one last time.” In exaggerating her illness for attention, she’s done it well enough to have convinced herself, and Keller milks these lines for all they’re worth. Keller also makes Sophie and Anushka’s developing rivalry more convincing by adding a slight Oedipal suggestion to her tone and mannerisms during her candlelit dinners with Greg.
“The Romanoffs” is driven by several strong pairings and rivalries. Anushka and Hajar’s developing friendship seems implausible at times, since the deeply racist Anushka insults Hajar so often and so unforgivably. But Keller and Melab make it work, in part because Keller makes Anushka’s loneliness feel so real. Hajar, as written, is perhaps too quiet and inexpressive, but in her few true altercations with Anushka, Melab compensates by bringing enough emotions to the surface to make Hajar believable. Greg and Sophie also work well together. Bourgoin as Sophie, who is one dead aunt away from the lifestyle she knows she deserves, occasionally channels Lady Macbeth in her conversations with Greg, although her cold proposals are deliciously edged with just enough sarcasm to avoid seeming improper.
It’s worth noting that production of “The Romanoffs” has been delayed and threatened by scandal. The collapse of its production company following allegations of sexual abuse against its co-founder Harvey Weinstein and the alleged misconduct of director Matthew Weiner means the status of Amazon’s would-be flagship series has been precarious. In light of this, it seems plausible that the ending of Episode One was rewritten. Towards the end of the episode, a woman is sexually manipulated by a powerful man with an ulterior motive, and the story seems to wrap up with the understanding that he’ll get what he wants. Then it concludes in a scene so saccharine and out of character as to seem grafted on. Whether or not this is the case, the premiere of “The Romanoffs” suffers from its ending, though it is overall a strong first entry.

“Create your own world, your own reality. DIY. Revolution.” With these words, Tim Mohr ends the preface of “Burning Down the Haus,” his chronicle of the 1980s East German punk movement. This message reverberates throughout the entire story as the true guiding line between the non-fictional characters Mohr details. The East German punk movement owes its success, he argues, to having found enough disaffected youths with a similar outlet for their anger toward the oppressive Erich Honecker regime. “Don’t die in the waiting room of the future,” these punks proclaim. When Mohr focuses on these people, each of whom individually contributes to the success of the movement as a whole, “Haus” excels.
The author’s ability to connect with these punks is not coincidental, however. Mohr, originally a translator, met past members of the movement during his time as a club DJ in Berlin. “In short, this book would never have been conceived without Kobs, and would never have been completed without Pankow,” he claims, referring to past members. This privileged access is what makes “Burning Down the Haus” so fulfilling to read. Mohr could have written a spectator’s account of East German punks, one that largely sits back and paints the scene with broad brush strokes, but his choice to dive deep into the lives of real people, each interesting in their own way, propels the book forward throughout the years of struggle these punks faced.
“Burning Down the Haus," though, does not glamorize their struggle. The punks have many enemies: the Stasi (East Germany’s secret police), neo-Nazi skinheads, a disinterested populace, even fellow punks acting as Stasi informants. Mohr deftly creates an environment of fear and paranoia by interspersing the book with punk lyrics of the era: “Minefields and barbed wire so nobody risks going over / Walls and electric fences, they’re snatching away our freedom / Automatic firing devices and minefields so we like it here / In our beautiful country, in our beautiful country.” In the face of persecution, some punks gave up the movement entirely. “It had always been so fun — the little gang of punks against the idiot overlords. All the difficulties had just brought them closer together,” Mohr describes. “But now [Chaos] felt overwhelmed. Beaten Down. The Stasi’s strategy of degradation had worked.”
Mohr’s account of the period is not all foreboding. The atmosphere of East Germany allows him to include some humor that, while dark, helps lighten the mood. And, in contrast with the Stasi, Mohr’s depiction of outsiders who support the punks is all the more touching. The decentralized church structure allows for individual pastors and deacons, such as Uwe Kulish, to create safe havens for the punks to freely associate. “The deacons who worked directly with the punks took their real-life concerns seriously, and helped them deal with trouble at work and in school and even with the police,” Mohr writes. There is even a low-level Stasi agent who gives a punk friendly advice on how to avoid jail time. These portrayals help humanize the constituents of “Burning Down the Haus” and expand its scope to East German society as a whole.
In one sense, “Burning Down the Haus” is Mohr’s attempt to demonstrate the power of art in an oppressive regime. Any notion of subtly nodding to present-day America is destroyed in his preface. “My initial belief in the importance of this story was reinforced after I returned to the U.S. and recognized an ominous echo in developments in my own country,” Mohr writes. Indeed, Mohr’s parallels between 1980s East Germany and modern-day America — mass surveillance, a legal gray-area that facilitates arrests, and the seeming failure of class or race-based protests — are correct and warranted. However, Mohr’s work should not be read as an instructional course, or even as a success story. While the Berlin Wall indeed falls, the punk movement also subsides. East German society as a whole certainly benefited from unification, but punkers themselves do not find widespread acceptance, which eventually necessitates a loose transition into the techno movement. This in itself is a stark warning to would-be revolutionaries: Even if they succeed in reshaping society, there is no guarantee their movement will survive to witness the aftermath.
That said, there is something heroic about this martyr-like approach to social change. And, at its core, lauding a bottom-up approach is what Mohr does best. As a result, even though Mohr arguably underplays the negative ramifications of the East German punk movement, “Burning Down the Haus” stands as a testament to the DIY ethos as a response to oppression, which, in this day and age, may be exactly what American society needs.

Friday saw the premiere of “Pod Save America” on HBO, a podcast turned limited series that will focus on the state of national politics ahead of the 2018 midterm elections. Advertised as a “no bullshit conversation about politics,” the show takes an in-depth look at the 2018 midterms and campaigns being run all across the country. Transitioning from a podcast to a TV show, “Pod Save America” puts a new spin on politics for a new audience.
The show is hosted by Barack Obama’s former speechwriters Jon Favreau and Jon Lovett, along with former Obama National Security Spokesman Tommy Vietor. They are joined by Obama Communications Director and Senior Advisor Dan Pfeiffer. This episode, held in Miami, Florida, marks the first of a four-part limited series, with subsequent episodes to be held in California, Texas, and Pennsylvania. They will speak with candidates, organizers, and activists throughout the country.
Much of the show was spent on straightforward commentary. Key issues included President Donald Trump, healthcare, the Republican Congress, campaign strategies, and getting out the youth vote. This episode features panel guest Erin Ryan, student activists from Florida, and voting rights activists Demetrius Jifunza. The way the show communicates its content can be overwhelming at times, perhaps to put the often cynical and bleak news climate into the context of impending change.
The hosts are impassioned, and their opinions are genuinely and skillfully articulated. This is clearly a politically-savvy group. Their depth of knowledge and understanding of political tendencies and nuances is impressive and convincing. This is no doubt due to the combined experience of working in numerous political capacities both in and outside of the Obama administration. The banter is lively and quick, with the whole panel matching each other’s wit and style. For example, Favreau’s gravitas complements Lovett’s humor well.
Although the show and its hosts display a clear Democratic bias, it holds up to a high standard of quality in terms of content, analysis, and wit. They make their opinions known bluntly, and do not shy away from partisan rhetoric. It should then not be a surprise to people that the hosts take some shots at President Trump, as so much of midterm politics centers on him. However, they make it very clear that divisive partisanship is not their primary goal. “We have to make the election about big things. About the things that matter to people’s lives,” Favreau says.
Pod Save America is a show about political urgency. In this time of political divisiveness, confusion, and cynicism, this is a necessary conversation to listen to. As Favreau acknowledges, “let's turn those cheers into existential screams, because it’s time for more news.” The show does this by transcending the typical pundit strategy, and trying to engage with voters rather than talk at them.
“Pod Save America” pushes past the podcast in their new TV medium. While parts of the episode do adhere to the podcast model (just sitting around and talking), other segments take advantage of the visual aspect, like in the canvassing segment with Vietor and Lovett, where the audience follows them on an afternoon of door knocking. This short, segmented format enables active engagement capable of attracting a larger audience unfamiliar with the new format.
The show, in its essence, is a call to action for Americans looking for significant change in the upcoming 2018 midterms. They stress its critical importance and potential consequences, but also inject a great deal of optimism into their outlook. No matter your party or political ideology, it cannot be questioned that the hosts care very deeply about Democratic politics. They don’t want you to just scream into the void. They want America to show up and vote.

“Venom” bravely resolves to rewrite the origin of a beloved Spider-Man villain in a story independent from the original franchise. At a time when many superhero movies can feel like permutations of the same heroic archetypes and contrived villains, “Venom” differentiates itself from the paradigm by featuring a hero that is not one but two people.
After a spaceship returns with specimens of shape-shifting alien lifeforms called symbiotes, the power-hungry Life Foundation, run by Dr. Drake (Riz Ahmed), explores ways to mesh the creatures with human beings through lethal experiments that exploit the desperate and unsuspecting. Meanwhile, an ex-reporter, Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy), struggles to get his life back on track after his fiancée, Anne Weying (Michelle Williams), leaves him. The plots collide after Eddie sneaks into Dr. Drake’s laboratories and finds himself an unexpected host of the symbiote named Venom. As two minds trapped in one superhuman body, they struggle against relentless captors and the corrosive nature of their own cohabitation. The protagonist’s dual nature adds a unique style to the action and enriches the storyline, explaining why the anti-hero continues to hold a special place in the Marvel Universe.
While the comics have Venom and Eddie unite under a mutual hatred of Spider-Man, the movie chooses to develop them as a unit for their own sake, which gives each character more depth and relatability. As such, the exclusion of Spider-Man ultimately allows for a closer examination of their dynamic. Generally consistent with the comics, Venom is an ostracized misfit on his home planet, something he and Eddie find they have closely in common. Together, they highlight the magic of teamwork, becoming a force more powerful than the sum of its parts.
Make no mistake, however: Their relationship is far from symbiotic. In Eddie’s body, Venom lays the ground rules — “Cooperate and you might just survive” — as they rampage through the city and bite off the occasional head. Eddie must wrestle with the appreciation of his newfound potential and the destructive toll such power takes on himself and others. Indeed, his internal conflict runs parallel to that of Dr. Drake, who shows the ugly consequence of letting pure ambition drive one’s actions. In the literal and figurative sense, when Eddie can’t escape his demons, he must learn to live with them.
Having rewritten Venom’s origin to such an extent, the movie arguably breaks out of the MCU, taking free reign in its fresh take on an established character. Fans have sparked debates over where the movie stands in relation to Marvel’s other hits, and though the answer remains relatively ambiguous, “Venom” undoubtedly stays true to Marvel’s essence. Behind every superhero movie is the underlying idea that through persistence and teamwork, good can overcome evil against all odds. That assurance is reflected both in Eddie’s attempts to journalistically take down the well-established Life Foundation and Venom’s eventual showdown with a formidable foe to be revealed.
Deeply meaningful in its written storyline, the movie carries through with satisfactory execution. As a disclaimer, it’s meant to be fun. Establishing scenes meant to get the narrative going are often short and to the point, making the movie fast-paced at the expense of occasionally choppy storytelling. Exposition, though artistically uncouth, serves to get the audience on board with the events without a belabored backstory. Such capitalization on entertainment likely explains the disparity between the critics’ and viewers’ take on the same story.
Outside of just being a “fun” movie, “Venom” does have its conventional merits. Acting can make or break a film, and Hardy’s performance brilliantly brings to life the likeness of Eddie Brock. In one particular scene, Eddie stumbles into a fancy restaurant, desperate to talk to Anne while still adjusting to the alien inside him that’s slowly feasting on his organs. Ravenously devouring diners’ plates, sitting in a lobster tank, and all the while telling everyone to shut up, Hardy perfectly embodies the distressed sickness one would expect to see in his character.
In its action scenes, the film effectively utilizes setting and special effects to accurately tell Eddie and Venom’s story, in its uniquely, action-packed chaos. When the sloping streets of San Francisco aren’t being used to reflect the downhill trajectory of Eddie’s life post-breakup, they become ramps for motorcycles and the crowded racetrack for a catastrophic car chase. The decision to have a fully CGI main character allows for physics-defying fight scenes, and a spectacular demonstration of the symbiotes’ capabilities in the final showdown.
In the end, “Venom” offers a creative retelling of the anti-hero’s origin, and its rich messages with an entertaining twist make it well worth a trip to the theater.

Transcending the stereotypical trash pile of jump scares, death by sex, and dumb teenagers tripping at the worst possible moment, recent knockout films such as “The Witch,” “Get Out,” “A Quiet Place,” and “Hereditary” seem to be the leading pioneers of the horror genre’s renaissance. Often snubbed during awards season and looked down upon as cheesy or hokey, horror movies are rapidly regaining their critical acclaim — just consider the brilliant screenplay and dissection of racial issues in “Get Out” or the bone-chilling terror and petrifying images in this year’s “Hereditary.” Spooktober is well underway, and while everyone continues to spread skeleton memes around the internet and plan their Vine-inspired Halloween costumes, “The Shining,” Kubrick’s masterpiece, set this precedent for horror as an elevated art form almost 40 years ago and that was truly my gateway drug into scary movies.
It wasn’t until I was 15 and had built up some immunity by watching tamer movies like “Coraline” and “Ghostbusters” that I decided to watch “The Shining,” the movie responsible for the famous “Here’s Johnny!” moment and frozen Jack Nicholson memes. Unlike some decrepit attic or dirty garage with a lone flickering bulb, the Overlook Hotel is spacious, well-lit, and beautifully designed with a view of vast, snowy mountain tops, yet it was terrifying like nothing else before. As the Steadicam followed Danny Torrance on his Big Wheel through the empty corridors, it felt floating in a vast, endless ocean with no way of knowing what horrors were swimming under the surface. It was the unsettling void of the building that made me uncomfortable in such a profound way — was it possible not to contemplate all the grotesque possibilities hiding behind closed doors or lurking just around the corner? My primal reaction to the movie could be summed up in one word: kenophobia (the fear of voids, empty rooms, and barren spaces). Growing up as an only child, I spent many hours alone and slowly got used to it, but despite my steadfast belief in science, I couldn’t ignore the unnerving, weird feeling I got in my finished, tastefully decorated basement. As a result, “The Shining” was scary in a way that didn’t seem cheap, but rather profound and touchingly personal. For once, I didn’t feel ashamed or embarrassed by my fear but rather impressed; Kubrick’s phantasmagoria was such a beautiful, awful enigma that it whetted my appetite for what quality horror could accomplish. I haven’t looked back since.
It is not strange for a bright little girl to idolize a badass nerd like Hermione Granger or for a middle-aged man working from a cubicle to recognize the Michael Scott’s and Toby Flenderson’s in his life, but it does seem strange that I’d make such a strong connection to a polarizing horror movie from 1980. I’d like to defend this movie’s strange place in my heart and break down just two scenes (even though I could probably write my entire senior thesis about this) that showcase the brilliance of its screenplay, acting performances, and of course, cinematography.
While for many Hollywood stars, portraying an insane madman or a cold psychopath marks a rite of passage and one of the biggest challenges of their career, Jack Nicholson, especially as he stalks Wendy (Shelley Duvall) up the stairs of the Colorado Lounge, makes it look so incredibly effortless. Immediately after discovering that her husband has spent the entire winter repeatedly typing “No work and no play makes Jack a dull boy” on his typewriter, Wendy is confronted by Jack Torrance (Nicholson), now at peak insanity and about ready to plunge into a murderous wrath. There’s something wonderfully humorous about Jack’s performance as he goofily imitates his wife, sticks out his tongue, and takes full advantage of his iconic crazy eyebrows. But how can your blood not also curdle when Jack chillingly states, “Wendy? Darling? Light, of my life. I'm not gonna hurt ya. You didn’t let me finish my sentence. I said, I’m not gonna hurt ya. I'm just going to bash your brains in!” This scene has stirred controversy for apparently requiring 127 takes before the meticulous Kubrick was satisfied and for pushing Duvall close to a mental break down, but I’ll selfishly continue to rewatch it for its mesmerizing tension and fantastic portrayal of unhinged insanity.
Any analysis of “The Shining” would be incomplete without a mention of Kubrick’s masterful cinematography from his sweeping shots of the Colorado mountain roads to the aerial perspective of the hotel’s eerie hedge maze. Walking away from a viewing of this movie though, it’s particularly hard to forget the horrifying image of a sea of blood pouring out of the Overlook’s elevators. It’s persistent, inescapable, and accompanied by a quiet, monotonous drone of dread. Whether you interpret the tidal wave of crimson slowly but deliberately swallowing up the camera as our unstoppable march towards death, the animalistic, violent nature of mankind, or the battle in our minds against inner demons, this gorgeous slow-motion shot has the power to chill bones. And the best part about it is that it does so without jump scares, loud, ominous music, or any other tired-out trope.
Stephen King, author of “The Shining,” may hate this movie for its blatant disregard of the source material all the way to the grave, but I’ll continue to treasure this Kubrick creation and am celebrating its return to Netflix right in time for the Halloween season.

In its first season, “Big Mouth” follows five friends, Andrew (John Mulaney), Nick (Nick Kroll), Jessi (Jessi Klein), Missy (Jenny Slate), and Jay (Jason Mantzoukas), as they journey through puberty and learn to deal with the changes that entails. “Big Mouth” is not the “Teen Wolf” kind of show where teenagers have Abercrombie builds and can double as models. “Big Mouth” is an animated take on real life. Andrew doesn’t have a six pack and chiseled pecs, but is instead a normal kid with half a mustache. Nick isn’t 6’3” with flowing hair and a jawline chiseled by Michelangelo, but is instead 4’7” and still growing. All of the characters in the show realistically go through middle school struggles. Their adventures include awkward mini-golf dates with parents one hole behind keeping tabs. However, as it should be in middle school even post-puberty, these kids still make the best of their time and have great memories. “Big Mouth” unflinchingly shows the pimple-filled, hormone-laden journey through adolescence that every child makes while educating and reassuring along the way that there is no one way through puberty and this show makes that clear.
Throughout its second season of 10 episodes, the five friends continue their hormonal journeys in new and exciting ways. Andrew struggles with a new libido and experiencing shame, learning to make conscientious decisions about sexuatlity. Nick deals with being a late bloomer, comparing himself to male classmates, and how to work through a relationship. Jessi deals with the common struggle of her parents’ divorce, an overbearing parent, and experimental drug use. Missy learns about body confidence and the power of healthy conversation. Jay explores his sexuality. Through its carefully constructed dialogue and thoughtful comedy, this animated TV show achieves what many sex ed classes throughout the nation only dream of: educating the people who go through the struggle of puberty and abolishing myths and misconceptions about pubescence.
The show informs its audience in a variety of ways. In Episode Five of the second season, “The Planned Parenthood Show,” one of the characters, the sex-ed teacher, learns about sex after his first time. The students try to understand contraception, STDs, pregnancy, women’s rights, reproductive health, and abortion in a fashion that is appropriately “not too preachy” as Coach Steve (Nick Kroll) states in the episode, and with poise. These topics have been taboo, behind closed doors discussions for decades. but an animated show is able to bring them back into the forefront of public health. For all the comedy and enjoyment that the show brings, “Big Mouth” is the pinnacle of honest discussion about difficult topics.
Beyond the show’s incorporation of difficult themes, such as drug use and abuse and pubescent development, it also can elicit genuine laughs and employs a goofy animation to lighten the mood. Also, the show explores development into adolescence in a comic, light-hearted, and genuinely enjoyable way. This is in part due to the excellent use of animation. The show uses a style unlike any other. It accentuates what most people would consider flaws but also what makes people individuals. All of the characters have large lips and big mouths. Some have smooth hair but pimples. Others have ratty hair but smooth skin. Yet others have long torsos and short legs. The caricatures depicted are those of actual people in everyday life, with points of both ugliness and beauty.
Further amplifying this message of individuality, the show strives to make every individual realize they belong whether they are queer or straight, tall or short, quick to mature or slow, smooth skinned or freckled, frizzy haired or straight. Even as teenagers in a pubescent world filled with Hormone Monsters (Nick Kroll) and Shame Wizards (David Thewlis), dealing with the struggles of growing up, these kids know that they belong. Many of the adults in their lives show them affection and help through worrisome times of self-doubt and self-loathing. Andrew, Nick, Jessi, Missy, and Jay are surrounded by great people willing to help through internal and external struggles.
Throughout the show’s too-short 10-episode season, this animated Netflix show has the opportunity to break tradition and make difficult conversations approachable. Like many cartoons today, it breaks boundaries and sets the stage for social change in the right direction, pubescent teens. As much as “Big Mouth” is an animated comedy, it is also a show filled with progressive, positive messages that leave viewers waiting for more.

2013 was a transformative year for 2000s emo diehards: My Chemical Romance broke up, Fall Out Boy returned from their four year long hiatus with “Save Rock and Roll,” and Panic! at the Disco released their fourth studio album “Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die.” While “Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die”’s catchiness and “edginess” made it an essential tween album, even the short time since has revealed flaws in its construction that call its status as a classic into question.
“Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die” is a medley of synthesizer heavy, storytelling songs in which Panic! at the Disco addresses a range of topics from unhealthy relationships and sexual orientation (“Nicotine” and “Girls/Girls/Boys”) to Las Vegas’ nightlife and promiscuity (“Vegas Lights” and “Miss Jackson”). The album’s opener “This Is Gospel” is an angsty song with a powerful chorus that broadcasts frontman Brendon Urie’s incredible vocal range and ability to belt at the top of his lungs. “Miss Jackson” (featuring LOLO) revolves around being in love with a woman who sleeps with a different person each night.
Paying homage to Panic! at the Disco’s hometown, “Vegas Lights” is an upbeat song about the magical atmosphere of Las Vegas at night. “In Girl That You Love,” Urie somberly sings over a synthesizer and steady drumbeat about giving everything up for the girl he loves. In “Nicotine,” Urie compares an unhealthy relationship to a nicotine addiction, accompanied by a repeated guitar riff. “Girls/Girls/Boys” tackles sexual orientation as Urie speaks of losing a closeted, bisexual girlfriend to another girl. “Casual Affair” is a simple song about chance encounters and one night stands. “Far Too Young To Die” uses metaphors to talk about the risk of losing the one that you love. The last upbeat and highly synthesized song on the album, “Collar Full” is another song about love and wanting to be shown love. The album’s closer, “The End of All Things,” is a piano ballad about an unchanging — you guessed it — love that acts as a reprieve from the synthesizer that was so heavily relied on in the rest of the album.
Compared to Panic! at the Disco’s guitar heavy and lyrically enticing third album “Vices and Virtues” — or to the Beatles inspired, acid trip of an album “Pretty. Odd” — “TWTL, TRTD” is too safe. Panic! at the Disco’s use of synthesizers instead of traditional instruments at first seems like an experiment conducted by the band to try to create a new sound but after a while, the repeated synth riffs over the majority of the songs do nothing but make the band – a band in which the lead singer can play many instruments expertly – look lazy and makes the completion of the album sound rushed. The lyrics are catchy, yes, but that is because they are simple and repetitive, not because they are particularly groundbreaking or notable. In “Girl That You Love,” for example, Urie sings the words “girl that you love” 16 times in a short three minutes and nine seconds. This would not be so bad if the rest of the lyrics in the song were compelling, but with lyrics such as “followed her, followed her, followed her, followed her home,” it’s safe to say they are not compelling — just kind of creepy. Piano ballad, “The End of All Things” is a pretty song but after a myriad of upbeat, synth heavy, repetitive songs, the album’s closer feels out of place, random, and almost like an afterthought. “TWTL, TRTD” isn’t a bad album, by any means. Despite the mediocrity of the rest of the album, “Nicotine” and “This Is Gospel” redeem the album thanks to their use of traditional instruments, Urie’s soaring vocals, and less repetitive lyrics.
In defense of “Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die,” sure, the songs are simple, repetitive, and annoyingly synthesized, but they are still upbeat and enjoyable and the simplicity works as a reprieve from some of the overly complex music that rock bands put out. Compared to Panic! at the Disco’s other music, “TWTL, TRTD” is without a doubt, not their best album, but that does not mean it is not enjoyable. The album is nothing but fun — with the exception of the last song of course. This album exemplifies Panic! at the Disco’s change in sound and subject matter and works as a stepping stone to their next two (and better) albums: 2016’s “Death of a Bachelor” and this year’s “Pray For The Wicked.” The album hasn’t aged well over the last few years and may hold up even worse in the future. Nonetheless, “TWTL, TRTD” will always be a special album for introducing a whole generation to Panic! at the Disco and emo pop.

Just as the most effective lies often hold a grain of truth, the most terrifying stories are usually grounded in reality. Imagine hearing tales of European noblewomen torturing, killing, and biting the flesh off the bodies of young girls, practitioners of voodoo in the French Quarter who could predict financial success as well as the survival of sick children, mysterious cases of humans spontaneously bursting into flame — and then being told that the stories were not stories at all, but that they actually happened. The nonfiction horror podcast “Lore” does just that, sneakily teaching its audience the ugly parts of history and unveiling the lasting effects of past injustices under the guise of a typical ghost story.
“Lore” is narrated, written, and produced by a single man: Aaron Mahnke. After the wave of acclaim surrounding the podcast’s initial release in 2015, Mahnke’s investigations into scary, real events have been adapted into a collection of books as well as a horror anthology series on Amazon Prime. The latest chapter of “Lore” is Episode 98: Never Alone, released on Oct. 15, detailing the formation of Seattle Underground in the mid-1800s, a seedy collection of gambling parlors and brothels that resided beneath the shiny, new downtown Seattle that was constructed after a devastating fire burnt most of the city to the ground.
An episode of “Lore” typically mirrors the plot progression of a thriller or mystery novel, first teasing the listener with a pivotal scene and then rewinding to reveal what led to that scene. Mahnke thrusts the listener into the midst of a strange, eerie situation without warning, capturing their interest with a brief taste of what seems to be just another ghost story. Mahnke then switches gears, explaining seemingly unrelated yet extremely detailed historical background that will eventually tie into an explanation of how reality informed the ghost story he began telling earlier in the episode. The clever strategy of beginning each podcast episode with anecdotes allows “Lore” to use the whimsical lacquer of a campfire tale to disguise otherwise dull history lessons and create a sense of unresolved mystery that a listener can only quench by listening to the rest of the podcast.
Given that “Lore” features no guests, no other voices or conversation to provide a change of pace, Mahnke alone carries the burden of keeping listeners engaged. His narration style is functional and pleasant enough for the most part. Mahnke’s relatively slow speaking pace and precise pronunciation are reminiscent of a father reading bedtime stories to his children, which builds an intimately eerie atmosphere and allows his audience to more easily absorb the plethora of information that he recites. Occasionally, however, a few oddly placed pauses and strange intonation can cause Mahnke to sound like a politician instead, reading off a script without fully processing the meanings of the words he’s speaking. Nevertheless, even if Mahnke’s delivery of the content is lukewarm, “Lore” still holds a certain charm because of his phrasing and spot-on word choice, painting vivid pictures with elegant prose.
“Lore” is especially refreshing in its unique take on horror — much of the horror genre tries to either prove or disprove the existence of supernatural creatures and scare the audience with the possibility that these demonic menaces actually exist. “Lore” does not take a stance on whether ghosts are real, but displays an anthropological view on how the very endurance of ghost stories illustrates the long shadows that traumatic histories can cast on the present. In the end, what “Lore” presents as truly terrifying is not supernatural beings, but instead the real people who committed the injustices that gave the ghosts reason for seeking vengeance and lingering in the earthly world.
History is often presented in truncated, bite-sized pieces. The result is that many people forget the past is a whole web of causes and effects happening in tandem. Some may mistakenly assume that historical events occur in a perfectly linear chronology, each event waiting politely for the previous one to finish before beginning, or worse yet, they unconsciously think that each war or reformation period exists in its own vacuum. To counter this, “Lore” deftly unites the plotlines of simultaneous histories through their common tangent point of a ghost story and effectively uses the horror genre as a platform to make the dark parts of our history memorable and visible in popular culture.

With a stunning glass exterior that seamlessly flows into Harvard’s new Smith Campus Center, Saloniki offers food and atmosphere fit for both the urban sophisticate and the culinary minimalist. This Greek restaurant opened on Oct. 3 and offers its customers a dining experience elevated by its beautiful space. The dining area elegantly integrates the urbanism of Cambridge with the charm of Greece. It feels spacious and open with its clean, white furnishings, abundance of natural light, and a ceiling decorated with fresh greenery.
The mission of Saloniki is to put a spotlight on the concept of “filoxenia” — the hospitality that Greece is so celebrated for. This focus comes through in their food, from the carefully designed presentation of dishes to the thoughtfulness behind the flavor. Nothing says “home-cooked” quite like a plate of simple, fresh food and the plates at Saloniki offer just that.
Saloniki offers a variety of different proteins, including but not limited to grilled lemon oregano chicken, Loukaniko pork sausage, and spicy lamb meatballs. The “Herc — which can come as either a pita or a plate and features braised, honey-garlic pulled pork — is a truly comforting option. Juicy and rich, the tasty pork is thoughtfully balanced by some sides that come with every pita and plate. The salad, dressed in a tart citrus dressing, refreshingly cuts through the richness of the meat. The spicy whipped feta dip offers a tangy, creamy respite from the fatty pork, and the classic fries and brown rice make for a mild palette cleanser between bites. To complete your Saloniki experience, I recommend washing it down with their house brewed Visino limeade, made with sour cherries and mint.
The unsung hero of the plates, however, is the house-made pita. As you enter the restaurant, you can see a cook tending to the fresh pita dough on the grill, and such a display is made all the more impressive when you take the first bite. It is unlike most other pita breads: It is notably thin, unusually crisp, and uniquely chewy. Mild enough to be the perfect vessel for the rest of the meal, yet flavorful enough to hold its own, the fresh-out-of-the-oven pita is an unquestionable display of “filoxenia."
Asides from their plates, Saloniki also offers souvlaki, salads, soups, and a broad array of small dishes. Their souvlaki is locally sourced, and is accompanied by Greek fries, tzatziki, sliced and seasoned veggies, and of course, a pile of pita. The lemon chicken souvlaki is particularly tasty, as the meat is tender and has a classic char-grilled flavor. The salads are refreshing, and can be made more substantial with the addition of meat. The Santorini has a particularly well balanced profile, as the playful sweetness of the strawberries meets its match with the saltiness of the feta. There is a plethora of side dishes, which makes the detail put into each one all the more impressive. The zucchini feta fritters are made from scratch, lovingly garnished with cilantro, and sit atop a smear of garlic yogurt. They have a delightfully crisp exterior and a rich and creamy interior.
And of course, no home cooked meal is complete without dessert. Saloniki’s sweets are full of subtlety. The baklava offers a nutty, sweet, salty crunch that can double as dessert and a snack: A drizzle of honey and a touch of cinnamon tie the thin, flaky layers of phyllo dough and the nutty mixture together. The almond cake is dense and crumbly, and saturated with a unique lemon syrup. Finally, the loukoumades (Greek donuts) are ever so slightly sweet, pillowy doughnuts that bring the utmost satisfaction. The customer can choose between a drizzle of honey and cinnamon dusting, a nutella variation, and a more healthy alternative of sour cherry, honey, and yogurt.
While the flavors are sophisticated, the ingredients are simple and whole. The service is similarly superb. At Saloniki, I was greeted by employees who were not only exceptionally friendly, but notably patient as I learned how to pronounce “loukoumades." Each offering beholds a trove of textures and flavors, making the harmony of each dish a display of excellence. Saloniki has managed to capture the spirit of “filoxenia,” bringing its diners an overwhelming sense of warmth and hospitality with each bite.

“Guys, swimming is tomorrow. It’s on the schedule!” Kathryn McSorley-Jodell (Jennifer Garner) is really quite organized. Trust me. She’s borderline type-A. No, actually, she’s passed that threshold. She’s really borderline unbearable. If the description of Ms. Kathryn appears repetitive, harsh, or overly simplistic, then the spirit of “Camping” has successfully been captured.
From the creators of “Girls,” this new HBO comedy reboots the short-lived U.K. television series of the same name. It centers around Kathryn McSorley — the classic cagey soccer mom from middle-class suburbia — and the cluster of family, friends, ex-friends, and in-laws she must navigate while on a camping getaway for her husband, Walt (David Tennant). As we’re gradually introduced to said cluster, something unfortunate becomes rather clear: These characters are wholly one-dimensional.
The show is engulfed in archaic stereotypes: We have our high-strung protagonist, her carefree sister, the beta-male husband and his over-exuberant younger brother, the irresponsible son, the butch lesbian — the list goes on. No character feels fleshed out beyond an arbitrary descriptor, and their awkward, unrelatable interactions make the chokehold of the script suffocating.
Familial and interpersonal relationships aren’t illustrated in any interesting or organic way. Walt literally exclaims “Brother!” to his sibling (Brett Gelman) upon their initial reunion, and that’s just about the extent of their sibling dynamic over the course of the premiere. The episode’s writers and series’ creators Lena Dunham and Jenni Konner might want to refer to a trusty little rule in storytelling: Show, don’t tell.
Granted, the premiere of “Camping” serves as just a single part of a planned eight-episode season. It is likely, if not inevitable, that we’ll see different sides of the characters across the remainder of the series, or some sort of growth for Kathryn at the very least. But a lousy episode cannot elicit positive reactions in the hope that the season will retroactively improve it. And even if the rest of the season did provide a greater focus on character, this expected growth narrative is terribly played out.
The journey being set up for Kathryn is nearly as tired as her archetype. Countless films from the likes of “Romancing the Stone” and “Tarzan” have told the story of an uptight woman irrevocably changed for the better by her experiences outside the overt rigidity of her society. She’ll probably grow as a person and learn to better relate to the wacky cast of characters she’s found herself surrounded by. But who is interested in revisiting this narrative? And even if this journey appears initially unfamiliar to you, is it worth the cringeworthy slog presented from the series’ outset? That’s probably a decision for the individual viewer.
One might assume, though, that most audiences would answer with a resounding no. And not simply because the show employs well-worn tropes, or that generalized stereotypes are no longer accepted by most viewers. Putting all this aside, “Camping” commits the cardinal sin of serialized comedy: It isn't funny. Much of the humor relies on juvenile physical comedy (the lesbian mountain woman literally shoots herself in the shin — she doesn’t even feel it, though, because she’s just that butch), and generally awkward interactions between characters. Series premieres often seek to put their best foot forward, but the episode fails to elicit a single chuckle throughout its half hour duration. In its main task as a new adult comedy, “Camping” has failed spectacularly.
It’s unclear if anyone could like or relate to HBO’s “Camping.” It sets up an arc we’ve seen before in a way that’s not unique or funny enough to merit existence. The “characters” are simply stand-ins for tired tropes in a series that feels radically uninspired and ultimately soulless. The premiere concludes in an almost prescient fashion: Kathryn watches in anxious terror as her band of campers jump into a local lake, throwing caution — and her schedule — to the wind. As Kathryn stubbornly digs her heels into the shoreline, one could only wish that Dunham and Konner had followed her lead, keeping this brash British comedy firmly across the pond.

After more than 40 years of the Star Wars universe’s dominance of not only the sci-fi genre but entertainment as a whole — LEGO sets, books, and classic action figures — the thrilling story first told by George Lucas in the 1970s continues today with “Star Wars Resistance.” Set in the months leading up to the events shown in “Star Wars Episode VII,” the newest member of the Star Wars family wades into previously untouched territory between the resolution of the original trilogy and the beginning of the sequel trilogy still being released today. During its family-friendly 43 minute runtime, we are introduced to a new cast of characters, a new planet in the outer ring, and a charming futuristic city in the sea. With its gentle nods to the origins of the Skywalker family of the first two trilogies and creative, original content, the show refreshingly leads the audience on another untold story in the ever-expanding Star Wars universe.
During the first scene of a show suitable for seven-year olds, the best of Star Wars reveals itself, something even some of the big-budget films have failed to do. Starting with a slow build of tense, subtle music finally reaching its peak as the main character, Kazuda Xiono (Christopher Sean), reveals himself to be a star fighter pilot for the New Republic, the show echoes that of its predecessors in a charming new way. As a new, non-jedi hero that children and adults can enjoy as much as Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Kazuda, in his child-friendly mannerisms, takes “Star Wars Resistance” on an excellent journey in space. Following some of the guiding principles of what many view as the best three Star Wars movies — the original trilogy — the show takes an exciting, original approach without becoming a boring copy of the past. The new planet, Castellan, rises over the horizon as a new world in the outer rim brimming with new adventurous opportunity. The main characters, Kazuo, Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Yeager (Scott Lawrence), and Neeku (Josh Brener), get into trouble and work their way out of it in a creative way making friends along the way. The rugged supertanker fuel depot, the Collosus, where the heroes fight for the New Republic and the Resistance against the First Order brims with history and depth. “Resistance” effortlessly takes its heroes and villains on a thrilling journey in an untouched part of the galaxy while staying enjoyable for any age.
Along with the exciting introduction, the show speaks to its family-approachability through its art-style, dialogue, and themes without losing the exciting touch of the more mature past. Through its charming animation modeled from Cartoon Network, which brought to life the most well-loved and renowned animated Star Wars universe, “Star Wars: The Clone Wars,” the whole atmosphere of the show speaks to its amiability. Through and through, the show aims to be one that a parent can appreciate while a child watches. The conversations never stray into unfriendly territory and the themes are heartwarming in their conclusion. Although “Episode IV” dealt with massacred families and the destruction of worlds, the lack of depth in the themes of “Resistance” does not translate to lack of enjoyment throughout.
As the Star Wars universe expands evermore with the annual release of a new film and the continual development of plot holes in animation, “Star Wars Resistance” is not a show to skip over. Even though it does not come close to the mastery that was “Star Wars: The Clone Wars,” the intended audience — seven-year old children in love with the space epic — will enjoy the show nonetheless. The fun-loving nature of the characters, the thrill of space battles, and the excitement that comes with new introductions is enough to keep Kazuda and his company of friends busy with new adventures for weeks to come.

When early last year news broke out of a live-action adaptation of “Teen Titans,” or in this case, “Titans,” excitement and dread filled the reactions of online media. For one, a TV show about this superhero team had been in talks of production since 2014, but had been put on hiatus and ultimately picked back up by DC in their new streaming service, DC Universe, leaving many childhood fans of both the cartoon show “Teen Titans” or comic book readers of “The New Teen Titans” with a sense of anticipation for the much-delayed work. On the other hand, virtual groans could be read on many social media outlets by these same fans, fearing another lackluster, cheesy adaptation of DC comic book characters by Greg Berlanti. However, after the premiere of the first season of “Titans,” it is safe to say that this is not the case.
Just like in the comics, “Titans” centers around a group of young individuals with fantastic abilities, but the show quickly deviates from its source material. Some main differences includes Robin (Brenton Thwaites) and Starfire (Anna Diop) being fully-grown adults while Raven (Teagan Croft) and Beast Boy (Ryan Potter) remain teenagers, as well as the general increased darkness of the show. The latter is most striking, as throughout the pilot episode there is a lot of gore and violence, as well as a generally more serious tone which may surprise many childhood fans of the cartoon series.
This first episode largely sets the stage for what is to come during the rest of the season, so while it is not very plot intensive, it contains many key character introductions and setting immersions. Viewers follow the story of Raven, a teenage girl who is self-alienated from the rest of society because of a mysterious, violent darkness that lurks within her, and early in the episode, soon in the piece, her mother is murdered while mysterious Russian forces try to kidnap her. At the same time, Robin, former protégé of Batman, lives a somber life as a Detroit detective by day and vigilante by night, and begins helping Raven after the death of her mother. In the episode, both Starfire and Beast Boy are introduced, with Starfire making an astounding entrance as she wakes up from a car crash in Vienna with no memory of her identity, and tries to recollect her past as she finds a photo of Raven, who she was apparently looking for after burning a man alive who was trying to kill her. At the end, Beast Boy appears, as he quirkily steals a copy of a video game in the form of a tiger from a local security guard, bringing a charming moment to the episode.
Furthermore, the characters quickly become likable as their storylines are increasingly engaging. As the episode goes on, it is increasingly difficult to wait to find out what will happen to Raven after she was kidnapped, or what exactly happened to Starfire before the car crash. For the benefit of the average viewer with no background knowledge of the team, the show quickly develops the abilities of each individual and characterizes them uniquely. People who enjoy ensemble casts will likely find this show incredibly rewarding.
Unfortunately, there does lie one great weakness with the pilot episode which rests in its cringey visual effects. This is especially prominent with Raven, whose dark side emerges numerous times, and somewhat resembles filters on Snapchat. The visuals of Starfire when she burns a man alive are also rather unimpressive as well, with too much vibrance causing her to look very animated and artificial. However, compared to the choreography of the numerous fight sequences and the general engaging plot of the show, this is only a small downside.
The pilot episode of “Titans” largely exceeds expectations of the average superhero show developed by Greg Berlanti. There’s no need to fear another cringey adaptation disaster like “Arrow” or “Supergirl,” or even another “Riverdale,” because this week’s release quickly displays a complex storyline with admirable protagonists, even if the special effects can be laughable at times.

If there’s any topic that has the ability to stir the pot in today’s boiling political climate, it’s the idea of entitled white men. As such, Tana French takes a significant risk in her new novel “The Witch Elm” by focusing on the well-off, charismatic Toby Hennessy, whose privileged life hits a bump in the road. Luckily, her gamble results in something timely and nuanced. A fan favorite in the mystery and crime genre, French has won acclaim for her Dublin Murder Squad Series, but “The Witch Elm” marks her first stand-alone suspense novel to date. Toby, a publicist who has managed to get through life with the help of his handsome, charming smile, finds his luck has run dry as he is launched head-first into a high-stakes tale of familial tensions, disease, betrayal, suspicion, and murder.  Despite the hokey title — let’s be honest, it’s more reminiscent of an R.L Stine novel from the ’90s than a sophisticated adult drama — and tiring 450 page-count, the plot immerses the reader into an eerie maze of uneasiness sprinkled with surprises, and French’s style certainly reminds any aspiring author what it means to craft believable, psychologically deep characters.
Toby opens the novel with the assertion, “I’ve always considered myself to be, basically, a lucky person,” going on to explain he’s avoided messy breakups, car accidents, drug addictions, and even braces. From that point on, the higher powers seem set on proving him wrong as Toby is beaten senseless by robbers and is later roped into a murder investigation stained by dark family secrets of physical abuse and sexual assault. Since sustained brain injuries wipe out large chunks of his younger memories, Toby’s ignorance of the tortures that his cousins Susanna and Leon faced as teenagers seem genuinely excusable, but the parallels to society are eerily strong. As the #MeToo movement continues to accelerate, Tana French provides the American public with her answer to one of its most pressing questions: What is going through the minds of average men as they are finally made aware of all the ugliness and abuse going on around them? In Toby’s case, his sense of truth and reality start to crumble, turning a man with swagger and confidence into a helpless, sometimes hollow shell. Towards the end of the novel, Toby explains, “My own life blurred and smeared in front of my eyes; my outlines had been scrubbed out of existence,” possibly predicting current society’s unsettling fate in the midst of this massive wake-up call.
Although the political timeliness should be intriguing enough, French’s engaging style and brilliant character descriptions will make any college student look back at her attempts at creative writing with a crinkled nose of disgust. When it comes to Toby’s relationship with his girlfriend Melissa, she perfectly captures intimate details like “the soft breathing curl of her in bed, her hair tickling my chin; lazy Saturday brunch in our favorite café, walk by the canal to see the swans, Melissa swinging our clasped hands.” Tana French’s delicate descriptions demonstrate the power of “show, don’t tell” writing. Even though this novel is high-stakes and at some points thrilling, French never shies away from these specific, concrete details which ultimately intensify the colors of the image she’s trying to paint.
Although none of her characters are radically unique or total diversions from the status quo, French still manages to avoid clichés or unoriginal tropes. While a stereotypical description of Melissa’s untight, goody-goody husband Tom would normally trigger some eye rolls, the idea that “he brings out the irresistible urge to warn him about drop bears and dihydrogen monoxide” is simple and brilliant — quirky enough to make the reader laugh but observantly accurate enough to perfectly capture Tom’s stick-in-the-mud personality. On a sadder note, French’s portrayal of Toby’s helpless existence recuperating in the hospital also opens a window into the darker parts of the human psyche. Trapped under “the vortex’s hold,” Toby’s descent into a pit of serious despair demonstrates the raw and painful reality that comes with a lack of agency.
The only serious weakness in this psychologically fascinating novel is its length. Clocking in at just over 450 pages, “The Witch Elm” has the wiggle room to fully develop its characters and construct a vivid, fully-imaginable world, but perhaps the novel stretches its limbs a little too far. Of course, any book takes time to develop suspense, allowing the audience’s heart to pound in anticipation until they finally put their guard down just in time for the big, unsettling surprise. The novel’s ending is charged with this electric energy, but unfortunately, the beginning lets the audience sit with their defenses lowered for far too long. Toby’s recovery in the hospital after the break-in and weeks spent visiting his uncle Hugo have some heartbreaking moments and interesting commentary about hospital care, but it honestly drags on for too long. When Susanna’s bratty son finds a human skull in the wych elm — not to be confused with the title of the novel, although the pun is almost definitely intended — behind Hugo’s house, it feels more like a shock from an AED machine than a natural progression of the suspense story. Although from an aesthetic standpoint, it’d be hard to see some of these beautiful sentences go, cutting some of the gorgeous but unnecessary fluff might keep the electricity consistent throughout the entire murder mystery.
It’s a pleasure to read a book that caters to the messy problems on society’s mind without compromising any artistic integrity. If the idea of needing some page-turning endurance in order to get to a glorious payoff isn’t intimidating, definitely give Tana French and her latest novel the proper chance they deserve.

Wild in metatextuality, Haruki Murakami’s “Killing Commendatore” — like its Carraway-esque protagonist painter — deftly combines numerous nested narratives into a singular pendulum. But its ambitious swing is stopped slightly short by the slow burn of absurdist elements and our painter’s ultimately static character development. Murakami’s latest work, which was published in Feb. 24, 2017 in Japan and recently released in the U.S., presents a fascinating premise of a mystical journey of self discovery in the mountains outside Odawara, but gradually loses track of its course until near the end of its 680-page trek.
One of the immediate charms of the novel is its blunt candor, as the opening pages reveal our unnamed 36-year-old portrait painter’s destination from the get-go. Upon his wife’s abrupt demand for a divorce, the protagonist embarks on a rambling road trip through Japan in search of lost identities and unpinnable artistic ideas. As soon as he settles in the home of famed Japanese artist Tomohiko Amada, darkly intriguing elements peek through from the spirit world and hook painter and audience alike. A mysterious bell rings from a sealed cave in the woods, a faceless man comes with an impossible painting request, and the discovery of a never-unearthed painting — Amada’s “Killing Commendatore” — guarded by a great horned owl in the attic threatens to make the “boundary of existence and nonexistence convalesce.”
The subplot involving Menshiki’s futile pursuit of a desirable woman and his precious 13-year-old daughter Mariye also provides a nice nod to Murakami’s tribute to “The Great Gatsby,” though subtle differences in the resolution in their relationships — or lack thereof — distinguishes it from a repeat of Daisy’s love story. Murakami’s narrator is enraptured with routines of American jazz music, absurdism, and a Don Giovanni-inspired central artifact that deftly speaks to the author’s dedication to cross-cultural translations. In the pursuit of artwork which itself manifests a transnational nature, Murakami succeeds in masterfully fusing Western and traditional narratives. However, as Murakami slowly but surely drips references of ghosts of Nazi assassins from the 1930s or warnings against dark “double metaphors,” the centripetal force that held our narrator’s journey together slowly deteriorates as its periphery spins out of control.
The average novel might resolve these elements in staggered linear plotlines, but Murakami’s approach is more akin to an experimental abstract painting of unfinished splatters. The novel’s conclusion leaves questions dangling: What are the spirits? Why the incorporation of explicit sexual scenes that propagate little character development? What separates the real world from the nonexistent? Murakami, like his protagonist, feeds us colors of timid beginnings only to halt, realign perspectives, and continue midway on a different trajectory. Although it is startlingly honest, the universal process of memory and reimagination, the constant readjustment and short-stopped pitches become confusing and ultimately disorienting.
Perhaps the least satisfactory facet of the novel is the lack of change seen in the protagonist at the end of his odyssey. For all his acknowledgement of the strange experiences on that Odawara mountaintop house, the painter’s supposedly newfound “capacity to believe...in all honesty that something will appear to guide [him] through the darkest and narrowest tunnel, or across the most desolate plain” isn’t a revelation as much as a romanticized recap of his alarmingly nonchalant acceptance of everything that comes his way. This absurdist perspective may have fit with the postwar trauma depicted in “Norwegian Wood” or the “The Windup Bird Chronicle,” but within the context of the leisurely stroll of “Killing Commendatore,” it begs a larger suspension not only of belief but also of faith that any conclusion will be reached at all. Murakami’s novel gambles on the power of art as an organic process, one that requires random discovery, unpredictability, and self regeneration. To enjoy “Killing Commendatore” is to surrender oneself to the flux of a wind in Odawara, and while the scenery is beautiful, one must reconcile the precarious danger of getting lost in the bramble of words and reaching an altogether not too timely destination back to square one.

The first solo artist gallery of Harvard Square has arrived. On Sept. 18, Cambridge painter Susan Miller-Havens opened her collection to the public, titling the event “Now You See It Now You Don’t” as tribute to the ever-changing landscape of the Square and the power of art.
Located at 9 JFK Street, between The Curious George Store and Urban Outfitters, this space has historically housed pop-up shops and short-lived shoe stores, like Mudo and Karhu. But now, the one-room gallery displays upwards of 30 Miller-Havens’ paintings, spanning her career from early surrealist abstracts to her more recent works, which are intimate portraits of two or three people. Painting prices range from around $1,000 to $11,000.
The day before the public opening, the gallery held an invite-only opening for around 70 guests. During this opening, Miller-Havens told her audience that this show is not a retrospective but rather a salon, with no series.
Alexandra Eliopoulos, a student at the School of Education with a background in gallery work, helped organize the event. Since Miller-Havens has a large body of work, her team, Eliopoulos included, decided to create a studio-style gallery in contrast to traditional galleries in which everything is eye-level and uniform. Here, paintings are not arranged in lines on the wall but rather in clusters. Blended temporalities and styles render the space more “approachable,” Eliopoulos said.
Approachability is important to Miller-Havens’ style. According to her website, Miller-Havens is “known as an artist who invites the viewer into the painting through unexpected use of color, absence of background, and inventive cropping of the images.”
On canvas, she also fuses her two careers: one medical, one artistic. For years, Miller-Havens worked as a reconstructive surgical nurse at Massachusetts General Hospital. While working at the clinic, she earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Studio Art.
“From a very early age I found my reaction to the world around me divided between a fascination with the inner workings of the mind and the aesthetic beauty of nature,” she wrote in her artist’s statement, which she distributed on handouts at the gallery.
In attendance was former Cambridge mayor Alice Wolf, a graduate of the Harvard Kennedy School, who selected Miller-Havens to paint her mayoral portrait. Since Wolf was the second female mayor of Cambridge, as well as an activist, she said she was looking for a portraitist who could convey shots in action.
“I saw that she painted baseball players, and I said, ‘That’s my girl!’” Wolf said. “I thought she would be able to portray activism. And she did.”
Wolf’s mayoral portrait still hangs in the Cambridge City Council Chamber — which thrills.her husband, Robert Wolf, considering all the portraits surrounding his wife’s are traditional male sitters. By contrast, her portrait depicts her speaking and gesturing with her hands. He said it captures her well.
Shari Tishman, a lecturer at the Harvard Graduate School of Education and Senior Research Associate at Harvard Project Zero, met Miller-Havens through the Harvard Graduate School of Education’s Arts in Education Program. Tishman admires Miller-Havens’ ability to attend to detail, as well as her dynamic style.
“There is a sense of movement captured, but not arrested,” Tishman said.
For now at least, the Miller-Havens Gallery invites viewers to stop by and browse. With a four-month residency for Miller-Havens, although a first for Cambridge, the gallery will not be here for forever.

Twenty-five years ago, “Hocus Pocus” first appeared in theaters and immediately put a spell on audiences and critics alike… Except it didn’t. When the film was first released, it was largely considered a failure. Opening at number four in the box office, and dropping out of the top 10 within just two weeks, audiences clearly weren’t itching to see it. Critics called the movie “dreadful,” “depressing as hell,” and “about as much fun as celebrating Mardi Gras under the influence of candy corn.” Today, “Hocus Pocus” is considered to be one of the greatest Halloween films of all time. It consistently brings in more than $1 million in DVD revenue every October. This year, an average of 8.2 million viewers have tuned in to each showing on Freeform’s Halloween marathon. Assuming we haven’t all fallen victim to a curse that forces us to enjoy a legitimately terrible movie, something about our perceptions has changed. But what?
“Hocus Pocus” opens in 17th century Salem, with the execution of three malicious witches known as the Sanderson sisters. Just before their deaths, Winifred (Bette Midler), the oldest of the three, promises that “On All Hallow’s Eve, when the moon is round, a virgin will summon us from under the ground.” The virgin in question is Max (Omri Katz), a 20th century kid who has just moved to Salem from California. With the help of his sister, his crush, a zombie, and a talking cat, Max manages to stay one step ahead of the terrible trio and ultimately (25-year-old spoiler alert) destroys the witches, saving the day.
Part of what makes “Hocus Pocus” so popular today is its ability to seamlessly blend darkness and hilarity. Not many movies can begin with a hanging and still manage to fit in jokes about calling breasts “yabos.” Ironically, this was originally a subject for criticism, as critics deemed the film “too dark for children,” but “too silly for adults.” Now, however, as the line between intended audiences blurs, “Hocus Pocus” has become a movie that can be enjoyed by children and adults alike. The witches, in particular, provide a distinctly dark sense of humor and innuendo that is entertaining enough for a child, but even more so for adults.
Despite their status as the antagonists, the three witches are undeniably the stars of the show. Though Winifred is certainly the scenestealer, Sarah (Sarah Jessica Parker) and Mary (Kathy Najimy) each get their own moments in the spotlight as the flirt and the suck up respectively. The trio features prominently on all advertisements for the film, take up at least half of the runtime, and even get to perform the breakout song “I Put a Spell on You” that has been inextricably associated with the film ever since. As a result, your opinion on the witches could make or break your opinion on the movie as a whole.
Perhaps this explains the difference in reception of the film from 1993 to today. After all, our perceptions of witches have completely changed from the early ’90s. “The Witches,” a film which came out just three years before “Hocus Pocus,” portrays the titular characters as unambiguously crazy, ugly, and evil. These witch characters are a force to be reckoned with, not a source of entertainment, reflecting the general consensus on witches at the time — from the Salem witch trials to “Maleficent,” witches have consistently been seen as villains. To those in the early ’90s, there was probably nothing scarier than a woman with power.
By the late ’90s, however, a new generation of witches had appeared. These witches were charming, beautiful, and most importantly, morally good. Sabrina the teenage witch, Willow from “Buffy,” and the Halliwell sisters from “Charmed” all showed that a woman with power is not something to be feared, but something to be admired. It is under this new feminist lens that “Hocus Pocus” thrives. After all, the Sanderson sisters represent the compromise between these two views. Yes, they are evil, but they are also hilarious and relatable. They are meant to be feared, but they also aren’t old hags with warts and crooked noses (Sarah Jessica Parker’s character in particular represents an extreme divergence from the typical witch’s appearance). In this way, “Hocus Pocus” can be seen as a turning point in popular media depictions of witches.
Whether or not the film had anything to do with the shift in witch representation, the film certainly benefited from this new attitude. Today, “Hocus Pocus” is a Halloween staple. The town of Salem regularly puts on “Hocus Pocus” themed tours, Disney has added attractions based on the movie to its theme parks, and there have even been talks of a potential sequel or TV remake. As this year marks the 25th anniversary of the cult classic, Freeform recently aired a “Hocus Pocus 25th Anniversary Halloween Bash,” which reunited members of the original cast. Clearly, these celebrations of the film could not have happened in 1993. For better or for worse, “Hocus Pocus” is now a definitive part of the Halloween experience, and the Sanderson sisters will live on far longer than their movie deaths suggest.

Something has always drawn me to “She’s So Unusual” — ever since I heard the thrums of the first measures of “Girls Just Want To Have Fun” when I was but five years old, I was hooked. Perhaps it was Cyndi Lauper’s remarkable, impressively versatile voice. Or maybe it was the rousing, yet comforting techno-rhythm of the instrumentals. In any case, the album still embodies the same dazzling, eccentric freshness as it did 35 years ago, when it was first released.
Indeed, “She’s So Unusual” was certainly an unexpected album on all fronts: Though critically successful, her last recording — the band Blue Angel’s self-titled album — was not quite so commercially, to the point where Lauper had to file for bankruptcy. As such, the album represents a reemergence, on Lauper’s part, into the forefront of the music sphere. And what a way she did so: “She’s So Unusual,” Lauper’s debut solo album, became a worldwide hit, hitting fourth place on Billboard 200 and staying on the list for 77 weeks. It received nominations for Album of the Year and Record of the Year at the 1985 Grammys, while its artist won the New Artist of the Year award. From this album came the momentum that propelled Lauper to success, particularly in her second album, “True Colors.” It presented her as an artist that was capable of accomplishing nearly anything.
This emerging prowess strongly manifests itself in “She’s So Unusual,” where Lauper confidently and suavely throws herself into so many genres and styles. While “Time After Time” is mellow and reflective, with its comforting synthesizer chords layered over an unassuming guitar and a smooth pop rhythm, “Girls Just Want to Have Fun” imparts a funky, happy, disco-like mood, bursting with youth, carried forward by incredibly catchy keyboard riffs and synthesizer improvisations. As “All Through The Night” coasts by with meandering arpeggiations, “She Bop” commands undiverted attention through its ever-changing instrumentation but relentless, intense sensuality. Weaving through soft rock, synthpop, soul and punk, Lauper creates a mosaic for herself in “She’s So Unusual” that fully embodies the end of the new wave in the early 1980s.
And yet, while doing so, Lauper manages to craft an image for herself — one that is distinctively hers. This is championed foremost by her unique, sharp, beautiful vocals: Their versatility, flexibility and dexterity create a surprisingly, yet convincingly, powerful through-line through “She’s So Unusual.” The same full-bodied, unabashed vocal inflection — slightly nasal, slightly rugged — that Lauper uses to showcase the fun of unbounded freedom in “Girls Just Want to Have Fun” mellows into an authentic passion for another in “All Through the Night,” while morphing into a hardened yet emotional reflection on reality in “Money Changes Everything.” Perhaps this notion manifests most strongly in “When You Were Mine.” Originally performed by Prince, Cyndi Lauper transforms the song into one that is truly her own. Not only does she fill the orchestration with the synthesizers that characterize much of the album, but she also captures the essence of her original voice by layering multiple vocal tracks in different octaves. Furthermore, she takes her sharp, powerful, high-pitched “pop” vocalization from “She Bop” here, where it becomes a natural release of despair and despondency.
Beyond purely musical aspects, however, “She’s So Unusual” contains its fair share of important emotional and political commentary. Between the lines of the romantic ballads and the edgy, slightly-rebellious songs that Lauper performs lie important social messages that we, as listeners, can still learn from today. “Money Changes Everything” serves as a lamentation toward the sidelining of love in favor of material purpose or gain. Meanwhile, underneath the guise of a dance-song, “She Bop” discusses female masturbation and the social taboo therein, reflecting that Lauper was entirely unafraid to sing about controversial matters, even in her first album. “Girls Just Want to Have Fun” reflects a desire for women to have the same social experiences as men. In fact, Lauper rewrote the lyrics for her song, having deemed the original ones misogynistic, and has since been referred to as a motivator for young women and an “anthem of female solidarity.”
“She’s So Unusual” represents a budding artist’s desire to create music in diverse genres, embody a cultural-musical trend, find her independent, self-assured voice, and discuss the issues important to her — and she accomplished so in an intense but artful, bombastic yet intentional way. Indeed, it was through “She’s So Unusual” that Cyndi Lauper found her eccentric, yet totally convincing, place in the world of music — which she still holds, given the popularity and relevance of her music today. This blend of masterful vocal sonority and unabashedly open commentary underneath continually catchy grooves never grows old, bringing listeners in — time after time.

As the Saturday morning sun streamed through the stained glass windows of the historic Arlington Street Church, the four members of the Boston Chamber Music Society presented a beautiful rendition of “Piano Quartet in G minor” by W. A. Mozart and “Piano Trio in A minor” by Maurice Ravel. Violist Marcus Thompson, cellist Clancy Newman, violinist Ayano Ninomiya ’01, and pianist Max Levinson ’93 shined in a masterful display of contrast: Ravel’s trio, heavily influenced by Basque folk music, served as a counterpoint to Mozart’s refined Classical style.
The program began with the dark and trembling chords of “Piano Quartet in G minor,” a piece arranged for violin, viola, cello, and accompanied by a piano. The quartet exhibited a lovely range of color with the dark and heavy material in the first movement, the peaceful and tranquil passages in the second, and the joyous and playful themes of the third. The quartet played with skill and precision, undaunted by the speed and complexity required by such a work.
Throughout the concert, the piano formed the central focus of the music. the Mozart piece was characterized by the running sixteenth note motifs that carried across all three movements: “Allegro,” “Andante,” and the “Rondo” finale. Levinson showed remarkable dexterity in a particularly challenging Mozart composition. The performance of the “Quartet in G minor” was a charming yet ultimately somber demonstration of musicianship that examined the breadth and depth of emotion in Mozart’s work.
The arrangement of musicians shifted here to a piano trio, creating an even more intimate feel for an absolutely beautiful rendition of Ravel. The first movement, “Modéré,” flowed like a dream. There was an occasional moment of tension that rose and fell, but always returned back to its blissful theme. The second movement, “Pantoum,” was a lively and almost chaotic scherzo. Flowing legato passages were contrasted with frantic sections rife with pizzicato from the strings and tense chords from the piano.
The third movement, “Passacaille,” brought a moment of unexpected relief with a somber theme that was passed from instrument to instrument. This section was simply constructed, yet deeply emotional. Each performer placed their own passionate interpretation on the theme, which has strong Basque folk roots. The simplicity of the music and the tenderness with which the material was treated by the trio made it the finest part of the performance.
The final movement was particularly challenging, but the performers skillfully brought Ravel’s gift of orchestration to life. The concert came to a rousing conclusion with the final triumphant chords of the “Final: Animé” movement.
The concert at its heart was a performance of contrasts. As the pieces were written close to 150 years apart, the composers belonged to very different musical eras. The Mozart quartet, with its boisterous and memorable themes, grabbed the attention of the audience and didn’t let go. The Ravel, meanwhile, was a more introspective piece that emphasized its musical textures.
The contrast existed not only within each individual piece, but also across the entire performance. In both works, the respective movements contrasted with each other, conveying everything from terror to bliss to freedom. However, the greater juxtaposition is Mozart against Ravel. Mozart's staunchly classical style is tight and controlled, which made for an organized yet demanding and precise interpretation. Ravel, on the other hand, is more unpredictable, and the performers used every opportunity to showcase their individualized interpretations. The styles were separate and distinctive, yet equally impressive.
The emphasis on the differences, rather than the similarities, made for a refreshing program.
However, in both the Mozart and Ravel pieces, the audience enjoyed a deft conversation amongst the strings voices and piano, elevating the works of musical masters to magnificence with a beautiful execution.

Witchcraft. Feminism. ’90s nostalgia. The beloved supernatural drama “Charmed” was practically begging for a 2018 reboot. While its return to the small screen was somewhat inevitable, however, the decision to shift focus to a new, more diverse (and more political) family was not. Unsurprisingly, this move prompted major backlash — by racists, misogynists, and fans of the original alike — before the show even began. Amid this atmosphere of anger and confusion, the Oct. 4 premiere gives hope to those willing to give the show a try. The “Charmed” reboot is certainly a cheesy mess, but enjoyable nonetheless.
Like the original, “Charmed” tells the story of three sisters united in protecting the world. But unlike the original, these sisters are not together from the start. In fact, it is not until the death of the trio’s mother that the middle and youngest sisters even know the eldest sibling exists. This discovery comes from the delightfully British Harry (Rupert Evans), a so-called “Whitelighter” who promises to guide the sisters on their newly inherited quest to defend the Earth from a series of demonic evils. Arguably, the more exciting inheritance for the sisters is their newfound witchly powers: Macy (Madeleine Mantock) is granted telekinesis, Mel (Melonie Diaz) can freeze time, and Maggie (Sarah Jeffrey) is bestowed with the morally-conflicting ability to read minds. In addition to dealing with hellhounds and warlocks, the sisters must endure everyday human drama, like emotional breakups or trying to rush a sorority.
The pilot does little to assuage some fans’ fears of the show getting too political, however. Within the first five minutes, viewers learn that Mel, the middle daughter, is in a relationship with another woman. Though not political in and of itself, this commitment to representation does demonstrate that the reboot is willing to diverge from the original in the name of progress. Perhaps more notably, the premiere episode focuses just as much on sexual harassment as it does on witchcraft. In what is certainly too topical to be a coincidence, the old white man who gets to keep his position despite such allegations turns out to be a literal demon. The showrunners take it one step further by having Harry read a prophecy that explains what brought about the return of evil: “When the weakest of men reaches ill-gotten glory… suffice to say, it’s your current president.”
Any show can shoehorn in relevant political jokes, but few can do it seamlessly. Based on its premiere, “Charmed” unfortunately appears to fall into the former category. Many of the jokes and political references do feel awkward and artificial, but this doesn’t spell (no pun intended) certain doom for the show. If “Charmed” comes to embrace its campiness, it could certainly be a less misogynistic, but equally cheesy, alternative to other CW shows like “Supernatural.” There are hints that the show will embrace the intersection of cheesiness and politics throughout the pilot — a particularly memorable moment involves Maggie shouting “When it comes to consent, you can change your mind at any time!” to a demon/her boyfriend who is trying to absorb her soul (surprisingly not a huge spoiler). It’s scenes like this — which effectively combine the political, comical, and supernatural aspects of the show — that suggest it may one day reach the level of its predecessor.
In fact, there are some ways in which the reboot excels over the original. The decision to depict an all-Latina family not only is a win for representation, but it also calls back to the prominent depictions of witches in Latinx history and culture, particularly through the concept of the bruja. Another promising change is the eldest sister’s profession as a scientist. At multiple points in the pilot, Macy uses her scientific knowledge to solve supernatural problems. If this blend of science and magic continues, it could lead to some interesting and completely unique plot points. Despite all of these differences, there have been, and there are sure to be more, callbacks to the original that keep the nostalgia rolling.
“Charmed” is undeniably corny, but that can work to its advantage. Fans of the original who complain that the reboot has become too ridiculous and political seem to forget just how blatant the politics in its predecessor could be (a particular episode involving Alyssa Milano’s character appearing naked on horseback in order to support her sister’s public breastfeeding comes to mind). If given the chance, the “Charmed” reboot can show its true colors and reach greatness in its own right, all the while being woke as hell.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“We will make Jesus Christ truly present today on the back of this Ford F-150.” Thus spoke a camouflage-clad Catholic priest in combat boots and priestly vestments during a field Mass offered during cadet summer training at Fort Knox, Ky. Indeed, the altar for the Mass was the flatbed of a muddy Ford F-150, and the congregation a collection of hungry, tired, and filthy cadets toting M-4 carbine rifles and MREs.
Mass was a welcome break from the stresses of simulated combat mass and maneuver exercises, and a spiritual necessity to get through the next weeks of training. Among those hungry, tired, and filthy cadets was one prodigal Protestant who had finally started to make her way home to the Roman Catholic Church.
I once wrote that I believed the pursuit of Christian orthodoxy did not necessitate my conversion to Catholicism. Privately, I objected to Catholic teachings on the Virgin Mary and apostolic succession, teachings I believed were not founded in Scripture. I preferred the energy and feeling of contemporary Protestant worship; I bought the age-old Protestant argument that the Catholic Church represented an unnecessary and counterproductive middleman between believers and God.
I no longer believe any of the above to be true.
In my objections, I was guilty of a grave intellectual crime. I made straw-man arguments based on what I thought Catholicism taught without even reading what the Church actually taught. Thank goodness for my ever-so-patient Catholic roommates and friends, who put up with torrents of my uninformed rants and questions.
I can’t identify a single catalyst that prompted such a reversal. My conversion has been a long time coming. Christians do not serve a God of coincidence, and it isn’t a coincidence that I’ve lived here with an amazing group of Catholics (and a wonderful Protestant!). It isn’t a coincidence a kind and generous cadet — himself a convert — at Fort Knox (of all places), prayed the Rosary and read the Catholic liturgy with me, even when we were deep in the woods ambushing and attacking “insurgents” with blank bullets.
The more I learned about the Catholic faith from people I respected and admired and the more I learned about the sacraments and teachings of the Church, the more I realized the extent of my ignorance. A powerful yearning to be spiritually home, a desire to be in communion with a universal Church I could call home, wherever I was in the world, slowly emerged.
I could fill months of columns with those learning experiences, and how my objections and hesitations fell flat on their faces in the light of the love of Catholics around me who took the time to teach and reason with me. I had to be less stubborn, less argumentative, and more open-minded and docile to the idea that somebody was telling me a truth that could save my soul.
I feel like I am becoming Christian all over again and my heart overflows with joy. Part of becoming a Christian is reckoning with a monumental choice. Is Jesus Lord? If we profess Jesus as Lord and savior, our lives are never the same. Similarly, I had to reckon with Jesus and the Catholic Church that claims Him as founder. After all I had learned, I realized that if the Catholic faith was false, then all of Christianity was also false and I ought to turn entirely away.
But if Catholicism was true, my life would never be the same. If it was true that I could know and love Jesus Christ as fully as possible on this earth in the Catholic sacraments, if it was true that I could be in communion with Him and his Church in an incredible and incomprehensibly real way, then I could no longer remain a Protestant.
On the night before Easter, I’ll be formally received into the Church after several months of preparation and instruction. I’ll be honest: I’m still a bit nervous. Practical matters will construct a real divide between me and my Protestant family and closest Protestant friends. Even though our shared bonds and love are genuine and deep-seated, and we profess shared truths and principles, living out those first truths can differ in very consequential ways. For instance, we won’t all share the same rite of communion, the source and summit of Christian life. That won’t be easy.
If I learned anything from a sweltering summer at Fort Knox, it is that faith can thrive and sustain through challenge and adversity, and even in doubt. I wonder, though, if perseverance in difficulties has its limits. I can’t overlook how I am joining a Catholic Church rocked by scandals and horrors of sexual abuse covered up by its clergy. How could I possibly want to join the Church at such a time? That’s a question for another column. But it remains the case that this prodigal Protestant can’t wait to finally come home to Rome.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly two years ago, Donald Trump was — to my utter disbelief — elected president. My boyfriend at the time and I cried in bed in Dunster House as we watched Florida go red. It was a horrific, earth-shattering, almost supernatural moment. We were blindsided. We were blind.
Stories like this one, from once-hopeful, college-aged liberals, read much the same. Echo chambers that shielded us from the truth, a realization that there are some out there who don’t think like “Us,” disappointment in particular demographics for not showing up or showing up in the wrong ways, and a burning desire for change. This is especially true of Harvard, where my peers, professors, and the surrounding academic community overwhelmingly espoused at least a certain degree of social progressivism. It hit me, a woman of color, like it hit so many others in different ways. America is not, and never was, for us. “Then maybe you should leave,” some said. What if there was some truth to the racist rhetoric we heard during the campaign?
On Inauguration Day, I was submitting the final letters of recommendation for one of Harvard’s postgraduate scholarships, the Gardner Traveling Fellowship. If awarded the accompanying grant, I would be moving to New Zealand shortly after graduation to study dance. Before the election, it had been one of several postgraduate options I had considered. After it, I only applied to opportunities on the condition that they were internationally based. In March 2017, I was offered the fellowship and eagerly began preparing for a summer departure.
I can and can’t explain what was so alluring about leaving the country. For obvious reasons, traveling abroad is thrilling and fulfilling. The excitement of going somewhere geographically and culturally foreign to your daily sensibilities never loses its luster. I wanted to be as far away from where I was, and New Zealand was as distant as I could fathom. I couldn’t escape the feeling that I was leaving from the U.S. more than going to New Zealand. The sitting president and the political crises he caused, in addition to my battles with mental health, contributed to a decision to get out and start over.
Auckland, where I would settle for a majority of my fellowship year, was everything I could’ve hoped for but little like I had imagined. Most notably, I’m enamored by its remarkable natural beauty. The city is enveloped by pristine beaches and peppered with sprawling patches of protected land. The birds sing different melodies here and the water glistens ceaselessly. The people are exceedingly friendly, curious, and approachable. They are so willing to connect with me, assist me, and befriend me. Granted, the big “-isms” still exist here. There is a current of rampant xenophobia in response to the influx of Asian migrants, and the discourse on Māori joblessness closely resembles the enduring anti-Black attitudes for which the U.S. is infamous. But comparatively, for whatever reason, I have felt there is more hope for social progress in Auckland than back home. With a renewed sense of hope, I found I had improving mental health. After a year, I decided to apply for a work visa to stay in Auckland indefinitely. Immigration, however, had other plans.
Last week, it all came to a head. For one, Immigration New Zealand rejected my initial application, forcing me to acknowledge that I may be asked to leave the country. What was supposed to be the destination of a gap year had become home. Aside from missing my family terribly, nothing about America called to me. After all, I had intentionally run away from a toxic political climate that had daily left me hopeless and hurt. Being able to virtually shut out the daily barrage of so-called fake news was intoxicating. Seeing Trump’s snarling face made me ill, and I had medicated my ailments with the move. To be reminded that the president and many of his supporters fundamentally disregard or even deny my humanity was deeply traumatic, and so I treated myself by leaving. But even a world away, I was unable to avoid news of the hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh. They became a bleak reminder of where I may be headed. Abruptly and acutely, my mental health plummeted, the illness returned.
Watching footage of Kavanaugh whine, sputter, and evade questions personally and deeply offended me in a way that was almost irrationally visceral. Much like the Trump effect, seeing, reading about, and discussing Kavanaugh had such tangibly negative effects on me. Their faces and names alone evoked such disgust. It occurred to me — I know these men.
The clips, articles, and soundbites relating to Kavanaugh that I incidentally consumed made me feel as if I were being confronted by my own attacker, reading of his hearing, and watching others defend him. Like Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, I did not report my assault. While feeling the same pangs of shame and hurt that I did after it happened, I figured that perhaps that’s the fate of all survivors — to be painfully reminded of your own assault whenever someone else’s is called into question, examined, and ultimately doubted and denied. Grappling with the fallout of an attack was hard enough to survive the first time, let alone with each and every accusation that goes in and out of media rotation.
I found out that Kavanaugh was confirmed four and a half years after attempting to take my own life after my assault and being admitted to University Health Services. Dozens of sexual assault allegations against prominent figures, the #MeToo movement, marches on Washington, and still, Kavanaugh was confirmed. I can only imagine what victims in the U.S. who will live with and under that reality daily must feel. A president who publicly mocks a victim of sexual assault for telling her story is now finally matched with a Supreme Court justice who enacted that very violence upon her. It will serve as a constant reminder of how our nation regards victims. They told me to leave, and even after doing so, I feel the shame from 9,000 miles away.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In this post-truth era, it is heartening that the work published by a scientist at Harvard who did not exhibit “Veritas” is being corrected. Last week, Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital requested retractions for 31 papers written by Piero Anversa, a former faculty member whose research mainly concerned cardiac stem cells. The retractions were issued after years of investigations and lawsuits involving Anversa’s work.
Especially in the sciences, truth and rigorous standards for conducting research are vital to the advancement of society. Thus, within the scientific community, researchers need to hold each other accountable and be critical of each other. As the joint statement from Harvard and Brigham and Women’s Hospital says, “The scientific community is interdependent and reliant on the rigor and good faith of researchers as we work collaboratively to advance knowledge and transform human health.”
The controversy surrounding Anversa also underscores the importance of replication — which is not flashy, but is nevertheless crucial. By encouraging other scientists to recreate experiments published in papers to see if they get the same results, scientists can support the idea that published research is no fluke. Replicating other work may be less glamorous than pursuing original research, but it serves an equally important role within the scientific process.
Hand in hand with replication comes accountability. Scientists must be critical of others’ work and flag malpractice — and own up to having committed it. Only then can the resources and energy of the scientific community be best put toward productive endeavors instead of correcting past errors.
This is best accomplished when research is open-access and data is shared across disciplines as well as universities. Furthermore, only does rigorous distribution lead to more accountable science: It leads to more scientific advancement by fostering collaboration.
Nevertheless, the problems that these measures aim to fix (namely research malpractice and fraud) are not just problems at Harvard — they are also tied to hospitals and labs in the scientific community at large. The Anversa incident comes in the wake of a large controversy involving Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, in which a top cancer doctor resigned for not properly divulging his ties to private health care companies.
But at Harvard specifically, issues of academic integrity arise at all levels, and the University should lead academia in addressing them. To that end, while we commend Harvard for taking action against Anversa, we wish there were an avenue by which the University could hold Anversa to account more directly, since he is no longer a faculty member here. However, this is not to say that Harvard cannot learn from the incident — the University should take it to heart and, due to its gravity, use it to formally reexamine its own procedures with respect to flagging malpractice.
While it is infuriating and tragic that a substantial part of one researcher’s academic career appears to consist of malpractice, the benefits of greater accountability could serve as a silver lining to make research more honest and efficient across the University.

The Harvard Alumni Associaton annouced the nineteen seniors tasked with leading the Class of 2019 as officers and house representatives in an email to the senior class Friday afternoon.
According to their website, the class committee will work over the coming year to foster “communication, participation, volunteerism, and philanthropy” among their peers as the class prepares to join the wider alumni community.
The group was interviewed and ultimately selected by the First and Second Class Marshals, Catherine L. Zhang ’19 and Anant T. Pai ’19, and the six program marshals and six gift marshals. Zhang, Pai, and the twelve marshals were elected last month by the senior class.
“These individuals have demonstrated commitment to the Harvard community, represent the varied interests and experiences of our class, and above all, are excited to give back to our community for years to come,” Pai and Zhang wrote in an emailed statement. “We believe that those selected for positions will contribute substantially by creating inclusive, accessible programming, building community for the class of 2019, and leading within-house events and fundraising efforts.”
Representatives said they were excited to bring the senior class together for their last year at the College.
“There are very few times physically where the class of 2019 comes together, one being...convocation, one of them being graduation,” Dunster House representative Victor C. Agbafe ’19 said. “That person you met during Visitas, or during opening days...you can reconnect with them and form a bond that can last forever.”
Agbafe said he looked forward to organizing a senior brunch in Annenberg, during which — in a sort of symbolic symmetry — students will sit with their freshman year entryway.
“I think the last time we were ever together as a class was freshman year in Annenberg,” Anne M. Raheem ’19, current co-chair of Currier House Committee and former Currier House UC Representative, said. “As we’ve gone through these four years and are now at the end, we’re able to create a space and opportunities for our class to...reconnect with peers we haven’t seen in a while.”
In her role as secretary, Morgan N. V. Buchanan ’19 will be responsible for communicating classwide programming to fellow seniors through newsletters and social media.
“It kind of reminds me of high school because you get so excited to be a high school senior,” she said. “Being on class committee is an opportunity to make sure that we can kind of recapitulate that experience.”
The house representatives, meanwhile, are responsible for organizing events to enhance the house experience during senior year, as well as leading Senior Gift efforts within their house.
Agbafe emphasized that students can donate time, rather than money, by participating in fundraising projects like car washes and call-a-thons if financial resources are a barrier.
The representatives, many of whom are involved in their house committees, said they were also thankful for the opportunity to give back to their houses.
“Quincy House means a lot to me,” Quincy House representative Rachel M. Chiu ’19 said. “It’s definitely what makes Harvard feel like a home to me. I really wanted to find a good way to contribute back to this community for my last year.”
Chiu said she was excited for her new appointment and for the committee’s work ahead.
“I think the group this year is a good mix of people that I know really well and really adore and people that I haven’t met yet,” she said. “I think it’s going to be a really great opportunity for us to come together as a class committee and try to make the senior year for the class of 2019 as special as possible.”
Agbafe said the committee’s work is also important to the future of the Class of 2019 beyond graduation.
“If you’re traveling to [San Francisco] one day, and you decide you want to crash on [a fellow alum’s] couch instead of a hotel,” he said. “I think that gives meaning to people’s lives.”

Former United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and former top U.S. diplomat Susan A. Thornton discussed America’s role in the political future of the Korean peninsula before a packed audience at an Institute of Politics event Monday.
The event — entitled “Negotiating for Peace and Security on the Korean Peninsula” — was moderated by Harvard Kennedy School Professor R. Nicholas Burns, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO.
Over the course of the 75-minute talk, Ban and Thornton converged on two cohesive themes: the importance of denuclearizing North Korea and the responsibility of the United States as a global leader.
Ban, who was previously a career South Korean diplomat, remarked on the significance of American efforts to bring peace to the Korean Peninsula — and the need to make the most of such an opportunity.
“It is very important that the U.S. takes a strong, principled position in dealing with one of the most serious global issues which we have not been able to handle and resolve,” Ban said. “I do hope the second summit [between the U.S. and North Korea], whenever it takes place, will draw out a concrete result based on a timeline [and] a way forward that is very clear.”
Ban also emphasized the need to collaborate with other global players in response to North Korea’s nuclear activities.
“There should be a closer, tighter coordination with allies, including South Korea [and] Japan. How to manage U.S.-China relationships will be crucially important, not just for U.S. trade and policies, but in resolving global issues, particularly North Korean denuclearization,” Ban said. “If North Korea sees any gaps, they will certainly try to divide the two sides and other partners.”
Thornton, a former assistant secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, highlighted the necessity of prioritizing North Korean denuclearization in negotiations over human rights and cybersecurity concerns. Thornton said she believes the U.S. must first achieve a breakthrough on denuclearization before agreement on other issues becomes possible.
“I think we have to convince the North Koreans that if they deliver complete and full dismantlement and denuclearization, that we will indeed deliver on a different kind of relationship with North Korea,” Thornton said.
Despite the U.S.’ willingness to approach North Korea from multiple fronts, both speakers agreed that some strategies remained off the table.
“We never did consider sending Dennis Rodman in,” Thornton said, eliciting chuckles from the audience.
The speakers also remarked on other facets of the Trump administration’s foreign policy. Ban, in particular, chided the White House for withdrawing from the U.S.’ international commitments, including the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and UN agencies.
“This has given, practically speaking, [the] wrong message,” Ban said.
Thornton agreed that the U.S. has an obligation to act as a global leader.
“We have a comparative advantage in global leadership,” Thornton said. “If the current administration is leaving the field to other players, we will end up much worse off for it in the future.”
Some students in attendance connected topics discussed in the forum to issues in their own lives.
“Being Korean, I should know about Korean issues. All my family is back home,” Sandra Moon ’22 said. “It’s not just about college and studying, but beyond graduation, all of these current events are very important.”

In the wake of the College’s first listening session about the fate of shopping week, Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda J. Claybaugh emailed College students Monday to address concerns about student involvement in her office’s decisions more broadly.
“While listening to students discuss their experiences of shopping period, we also heard some students say that they felt excluded from decisions being made about undergraduate education more generally,” Claybaugh wrote. “Going forward, I'm committed to communicating with you often and more directly—and I invite you to share your thoughts about how we might work together to ensure that your education is the very best it can be.”
The listening sessions, meant to collect student feedback on the possibility of eliminating shopping week — a Harvard scheduling quirk where undergraduates are allowed to try out numerous classes each semester before finalizing their schedules — started last week following student outcry agains the potential change.
The Undergraduate Council originally planned to host a town hall about shopping week, but Claybaugh announced last week that the Office of Undergraduate Education would instead host three administrator-led events for students to share their thoughts. Members of a recently formed committee tasked with considering alternatives to Shopping Week are slated to attend each session
Prior to the listening sessions, the Undergraduate Council held a student organizing meeting to strategize ways to reach administrators with their concerns. Not everyone, however, is so committed to maintaining the tradition — many faculty and graduate student teaching fellows have raised concerns how about how shopping week causes uncertainty in scheduling and course planning.
After Thursday’s event in Quincy House, where Claybaugh said students raised concerns about their involvement in decisions coming down from her office, she wrote in her email that she has asked Professor Bernhard Nickel, the chair of the faculty committee, to update students on what it learns in the sessions.
“In the meantime, my office will find additional ways to solicit your thoughts, and we will continue to update you about the process,” Claybaugh wrote.

Harvard’s student body skews wealthy — and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana indicated in court testimony this week that he’s okay with that.
Khurana stepped to the witness stand around 3 p.m. Monday in the high-stakes and high-profile Harvard admissions trial that could decide the fate of affirmative action in the United States. Adam K. Mortara — the head lawyer for Students for Fair Admissions, the anti-affirmative action group suing the University over its admissions process — rose to face the dean.
Mortara asked whether Khurana is aware that the portion of United States households that draw an annual income of over $150,000 hovers around 5 percent (though CNN reported in 2016 that roughly 11 percent of American citizens rank in that economic category). He then asked whether Khurana is aware that individuals in that income bracket make up roughly 30 percent of Harvard’s student body.
Though there is no definitive data on the matter, The Crimson’s 2018 freshman survey revealed that 54.6 percent of respondents indicated their families make more than $125,000 per year. Seventeen percent of respondents reported an annual income of over $500,000. (Sixty-five percent of the Class of 2022 took the survey and The Crimson did not adjust the data for response bias.)
“Don’t you actually think that Harvard’s class should have a socioeconomic makeup that looks a lot more like America, provided the students were academically qualified to be at Harvard?” Mortara asked Khurana. “Your personal opinion, sir?”
“I don’t,” Khurana replied.
“What is special about wealthy people that Harvard needs to have them overrepresented by a factor of six on its campus?” Mortara asked later.
In response, Khurana said Mortara was missing the point.
“We’re not trying to mirror the socioeconomic or income distribution of the United States,” Khurana said. “What we’re trying to do is identify talent and make it possible for them to come to a place like Harvard.”
In total, Khurana spoke for roughly an hour on the sixth day of the admissions trial, which is slated to last for at least three weeks. The dean will return to the witness stand Tuesday morning.
At stake is whether or not Harvard discriminates against Asian-American applicants, as SFFA alleged when it filed suit against the University in 2014. Khurana is the highest-ranking administrator to testify in the John Joseph Moakley United States Courthouse to date, though former University President Drew G. Faust is scheduled to appear in court some time in the next week or so.
Khurana arrived at the courthouse sporting a blue blazer, a purple-checkered shirt, and a purple tie. In their first chance at the dean, SFFA lawyers did not spend much time on any one line of questioning, instead drifting from one subject to another.
Portions of the questioning were more substantive than others. In addition to quizzing Khurana about Harvard’s socioeconomic diversity, Mortara asked him about race-neutral alternatives to the College’s race-conscious admissions process. And he pressed the dean on whether Khurana believes the school’s admissions policies disadvantage Asian-American students.
Khurana repeatedly insisted he does not.
“I don’t believe that Harvard College’s admissions process disadvantages Asians,” Khurana said.
The dean seemed slightly tense Monday, often pausing several seconds before responding to Mortara’s inquiries and giving one-word answers.
But there were light-hearted moments, too — such as when Mortara quizzed the dean on the acknowledgements listed in his Ph.D. “thesis.”
“I hope I partially dedicated it to my wife,” Khurana said, spurring laughter in the courtroom.
And sometimes, the SFFA lawyer took things back to basics.
“You’re the dean of Harvard College, correct?” Mortara asked. The dean answered in the affirmative.
“You understand this case is about Harvard admissions, right?”
Khurana again answered in the affirmative.

Despite appearances, Harvard and Students for Fair Admissions — the anti-affirmative action group suing the University over its admissions policies — don’t disagree on everything.
Both say they think college campuses across the United States should be racially and socioeconomically diverse. They just differ on how to get there.
Harvard long ago chose a race-conscious admissions model in which College reviewers give a “tip” — or preference — to underrepresented minorities. SFFA alleges this system leads the school to reject qualified Asian-American applicants in favor of less deserving individuals from other racial backgrounds. (Harvard has repeatedly denied all charges of discrimination.)
SFFA argues the College should instead pursue a race-neutral alternative known as “class-based affirmative action.” Under this system, admissions officers would use income levels — not race — to decide which students to tip.
Richard D. Kahlenberg ’85, an education researcher and fellow at the Century Foundation, took the witness stand Monday morning in the Harvard admissions trial to make the case for income-based candidate evaluation. Kahlenberg, whom SFFA previously paid to analyze College admissions data, spoke for roughly two hours in the John Joseph Moakley United States Courthouse on the sixth day of the trial.
Kahlenberg argued socioeconomic affirmative action by itself will forge racial and economic diversity on campuses including Harvard’s. He noted other institutions of higher education use this model.
“There's essentially a menu of different options that a number of universities have employed,” Kahlenberg said. “Socioeconomic preferences is one, to start with, that a number of universities have used.”
Harvard administrators and lawyers have repeatedly rejected this idea, asserting only race-conscious admissions policies will produce the diverse student body they say is essential to achieving the school’s educational mission.
Still, the University at least twice explored switching to a race-neutral admissions model. In 2014 and mid-2017, Harvard formed two separate committees to consider the possibility. The first “reached no conclusions,” per a court filing. The second recommended the College stick to its current admissions system.
In a landmark ruling in 2003, the Supreme Court told American colleges and universities they should give “serious, good faith consideration of workable race-neutral alternatives” to race-based affirmative action. The two committees’ work, Harvard argues, meets that Court-mandated requirement. To no one’s surprise, SFFA disagrees.
In coming weeks, Judge Allison D. Burroughs will have to decide whose version of events is most accurate. As she deliberates, she’ll review hours of witness testimony as well as hundreds of pages of previously confidential Harvard documents that bubbled up during the course of the suit.
Administrator after administrator confidently stepped to the stand over the past week to defend the College’s race-conscious admissions process. But evidence presented in court sheds light on previously private moments in Harvard history when top officials seemed a little less sure — and revives a long-running debate over whether race or income should reign supreme in the admissions process.
It started with a website.
In April 2014 — several months before SFFA filed suit against Harvard — the group's president Edward Blum began hunting for Harvard rejects who believed they failed to earn acceptance to the College due to their race. To facilitate that search, he launched the website harvardnotfair.com.
The site set off alarm bells in Cambridge.
The day after the website’s debut, Harvard General Counsel Robert W. Iuliano ’83 arranged a meeting with Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67, Director of Admissions Marlyn E. McGrath ’70, and Harvard employee Elizabeth B. Yong to discuss “the possibility of a lawsuit against Harvard,” according to documents released as part of the trial.
After a series of internal conversations, Harvard administrators later formed a nearly 30-member committee and tasked it with examining the feasibility of race-neutral alternatives to race-based affirmative action.
The so-called “Ryan Committee,” chaired by former Dean of the Graduate School of Education James E. Ryan, met “approximately” three times in 2014, according to June filing from SFFA lawyers.
The committee's members hailed from across the University’s schools. Among them were Iuliano, former Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67, former head of the Office of Institutional Research Erin Driver-Linn, Economics Professor Raj Chetty ’00, and Head Men’s Basketball Coach Tommy Amaker.
Details about the committee and its work are sparse. Harvard has repeatedly cited attorney-client privilege in refusing to release more information about the group, according to an SFFA filing.
What is known is that the committee concluded its work in December 2014. The group ultimately “produced no written work product and reached no conclusions as to whether Harvard could achieve the educational benefits of diversity without using racial classifications in admissions,” according to court documents.
Roughly three years later in July 2017 — for unknown reasons — Harvard officials formed a second committee and gave it the same mission as the first. Former Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith chaired the new committee, referred to as the “Smith Committee” in court filings.
That committee was much smaller. Its membership clocked in at three: Fitzsimmons, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, and Smith.
The group met seven times between August 2017 and April 2018, according to court filings. Lawyers for Harvard attended each meeting.
Ultimately, the Smith Committee, too, stuck to the status quo.
The group concluded that “at present, no workable race-neutral alternatives could promote Harvard’s diversity-related educational objectives as well as Harvard’s current whole-person race-conscious admissions program while also maintaining the standards of excellence that Harvard seeks in its student body,” according to court documents.
Monday saw a war of statistics months in the making.
Kahlenberg relied on a complex model of Harvard’s admissions process to argue switching to a race-neutral, income-based admissions system would increase the diversity of Harvard’s campus. The University — on Monday and in weeks prior — endeavored to prove the opposite.
Well before heading to court this week, Kahlenberg collaborated with Duke Professor of Economics Peter S. Arcidiacono, another expert witness in SFFA’s employ, to build a model of the Harvard admissions process based on six years of internal data associated with more than 150,000 applications.
The model allowed Kahlenberg and Arcidiacono to assign different weights to various factors Harvard uses to evaluate applicants — factors such as race, legacy status, and socioeconomic background — and then guess at the makeup of the resulting College class.
To test a race-neutral admissions system, Arcidiacono began by “turning off” the racial preference. He then boosted the “tip” given to low-income students.
Kahlenberg presented four variations of this admissions scenario Monday. All predicted an increased percentage of Asian-American admits. Three of the four scenarios led to increased Hispanic enrollment and decreased white enrollment. Every single one of the simulations predicted a decreased percentage of African-American admits.
Kahlenberg’s simluations also generated a shift in socioeconomic makeup. In every scenario, the number of students admissions officers categorize as economically “disadvantaged” increased nearly three-fold.
When pressed by Harvard’s lead trial lawyer, William F. Lee ’72, Kahlenberg said he “can’t think of an example” of a single situation in which a race-neutral admissions process would not lead to sufficient racial diversity on campus.
But Harvard has its own experts.
Relying on analysis from University of California Economics Professor David E. Card, the University argued ahead of the trial that ending race-conscious admissions would severely drive down minority enrollment. Card, who was paid by Harvard for his work, projected that a race-blind admissions process would reduce the number of College students who identify as African-American, Hispanic, or “Other” by roughly 50 percent.
Besides, University lawyers argue, Harvard is already pursuing race-neutral programs that help achieve a diverse student body. Attorneys pointed to the school’s generous financial aid program, its wide-ranging recruitment efforts, and its special consideration of students from “disadvantaged” backgrounds, among other things.
“Harvard’s efforts to promote diversity go far beyond its consideration of race in the admissions process,” lawyers wrote in a June court filing.
Kahlenberg is one of two expert witnesses SFFA’s lawyers are set to examine in the lawsuit. Top Harvard administrators are also taking a grilling.
Khurana began testifying Monday and will return to the witness stand Tuesday morning. Smith and former University President Drew G. Faust are slated to follow him some time this week.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As boats rowed down the nearby Charles River during the annual Head of the Charles Regatta, so, too, did the hopes of an Ivy League championship float away for the Harvard football team on Saturday.
With the Crimson challenging one of the two undefeated division teams, No. 18/23 Princeton, Harvard’s defense nearly carried it through in the 29-21 loss. Taking place at Harvard Stadium, the 111th rendition of this rivalry served as the first game in Harvard’s upcoming all-Ivy slate for the remainder of the season.
DEFENSE ALMOST WINS CHAMPIONSHIPS
In its five matchups prior to Harvard, Princeton averaged 52 points on offense. Saturday, the team put up just 29.
In its five matchups prior to Harvard, Princeton never won by fewer than 35 points. Saturday, the team won by eight.
In its five matchups prior to Harvard, Princeton’s lowest halftime score was 28. On Saturday, the team finished the first half with 10.
In every conceivable metric, Princeton’s offense was shuttered in the midday tilt. The powerhouse offense that had yet to score fewer than 45 points — despite losing starting quarterback John Lovett to injury against Brown — never led Harvard by more than two possessions.
“We haven’t played in the fourth quarter and that was the next obstacle and a barrier we had to come through on,” Princeton coach Bob Surace said. “Credit Harvard. They played their tails off. It was a great game, it’s typical college football game with two really good teams going back and forth and we were very fortunate to come up with a few more plays.”
Even then, Harvard’s defense put up a goose egg in the opening 15 minutes of the half, a streak which likewise saw no Harvard tallies.
Lovett saw his worst performance of the season calling plays from behind the center. The quarterback tallied a season-low passing percentage (48.4), amount of touchdown throws (one), and sum of rushing yards (45). He tied for a season-low in rushing touchdowns (one), too.
In the defensive effort for Harvard, sophomore linebacker Jordan Hill tallied a season-best 11 tackles. Senior defensive tackle Stone Hart punched his way through the line for 2.5 tackles for loss.
“I don’t know how many tackles [Hill] had but it seemed like he was at least in double digits,” Surace said. “Hill was all over the field and he is so athletic for a big guy it made it really hard.”
THIRD TIME’S A CHARM
Harvard entered the match with the best third-down defense in the Ivy League and the ninth best in the nation. Princeton arrived at Harvard Stadium ranked first in the conference and third in the nation in third-down offense.
It was clear that Princeton’s effectiveness on third-down would foretell the squad’s match-long success. Princeton’s .553 conversion percentage tumbled in the 60 minutes against Harvard.
“We talked about situational football during the week, that third downs and redzone were going to play huge factors in this game,” Surace said. “They make you earn everything. They have a terrific pass rush, they’re athletic.”
The visiting squad converted five attempts on 18 tries, good for a .278 conversion rate.
“Coach [Scott] Larkee came up with a great plan and he really simplified [theirs], that made it easy for Stone [Hart] and I to make plays,” said senior defensive tackle Richie Ryan. “Stone was playing lights out. I’m really proud of the defensive line, linebackers, everyone.”
The third-down defense did not carry over into the fourth. The visitors converted a perfect three-for-three on fourth downs to continue a two-game streak of perfection on make-or-break tries.
BLOWN AWAY
With winds as high as 17 miles per hour on Saturday, the weather added another dimension of trickiness to converting through the air. In fact, Surace attributed his sub-standard play to the wind — in addition to the defensive line.
“It was a tough day wind-wise as well,” Surace said. “I think both quarterbacks struggled a little bit with accuracy and not only accuracy but I think both D-lines got pressure. I think it was a tough day to be out there because you didn’t have a lot of time, and when you were throwing it until the very end there was a really stiff wind.”
Harvard senior quarterback Tom Stewart completed 19 of 35 attempts. The effort was good enough for two touchdowns and 223 yards through the air.
Harvard coach Tim Murphy didn’t think the wind played as much of a role as Surace did.
“We’re used to the wind, it’s kind of a constant,” Murphy said. “The 15-mile an hour thing, swirling wind in Harvard Stadium, that’s all we know this time of year so I don’t think it was that big of a factor.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For years, the men’s soccer team would walk back to the locker room to see the jersey of one of its legends, Mike Fucito ’08, hanging up on the wall. Fucito played for the Crimson for all four years, racking up the Ivy League Rookie of the Year award, three All-Ivy first teams, and scoring 32 goals. Today, he is back at Harvard as the squad’s new Assistant Coach.
A native of Westford, Massachusetts, Fucito grew up a hockey player, wrestler, and soccer forward before making his way to Cambridge. His time with the Crimson was marked with great success on the field, enough to be drafted by Seattle Sounders FC in the 2nd round (46th pick overall) of the 2009 MLS SuperDraft.
After three years with the Sounders, Fucito made stops with the Montreal Impact, Portland Timbers, and San Jose Earthquakes, totaling 53 games over his career before taking up a Harvard coaching position — first with the men’s golf team.
“I sort of needed a break from soccer, and golf has always been one of my passions,” Fucito said. “Golf also opened my mind up to coaching as a career.”
Even as a golfer, Fucito has had an impressive career, being named to the Golf Digest Magazine’s Top 100 Professional Athlete Golfers in December of 2015.
But eventually, Fucito felt an urge to return to soccer, transitioning from the links to the pitch.
“[The men’s soccer team is] a great group of guys,” Fucito reflected. “[Soccer] is all I’ve done, all I’ve known for my whole life, so coming back and coaching is a pretty natural fit.”
Fucito’s stellar playing career and coaching background helped him transition to the soccer team this past June through being able to see the game from both the players’ and coaches’ perspectives.
“Immediately, he got a lot of respect from the players,” said captain and midfielder Sam Brown. “People pay attention more to him, more than guys and coaches who maybe haven’t gone to the professional level.”
For now, Fucito is working with the team’s forwards, which means his primary focus is on honing the Crimson’s offense. But in many ways, Fucito still feels like a player leading his team rather than a coach.
“I still see myself as a player,” Fucito said. “You look at the game with a different lens [as a coach], obviously. It’s definitely different. When you’re playing, you have direct control over what happens in the game. As a player, you’re always thinking, ‘What can I do on the field to help my team win?’ but as a coach you’re sort of looking at how all the pieces fit together.”
Fucito’s experience at all levels of soccer helps him bring new perspectives to his coaching, being able to compare side-by-side the differences in play between college and professional soccer.
“In college I was always the fastest player,” Fucito said. “I was still pretty fast in the MLS, but the whole game just moves faster. Everyone is fit, everyone is skilled, so it becomes much more of a question of how you’re reading the game and how you are executing tactics. The season is more tiring, with more games than college, and things like the three [substitution] rule, and so you also have to take care of your body more.”
Coach Fucito’s relative youth and recent exposure to the game also help him in sharpening his players’ skills.
“He’ll sometimes just jump into drills and play with us,” Brown said. “It honestly feels like he’s one of us.”
As the Crimson looks to finish its season on a positive note, Fucito’s competitiveness in practice and in games distinguishes him from previous coaches and promises to give his group a boost down the stretch.
“[Fucito] is super different from any coaches that I’ve had. Probably the intensity and competitiveness that he brings is something that I’ve not worked with before,” Brown concluded.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Looking to close out the fall season on a high note, the Harvard women’s golf team traveled cross-country to take on top-notch competition in the Stanford Invitational hosted by Condoleezza Rice.
By the end of Sunday’s action, Harvard had pieced together an aggregate score of 905 (299-298-308), landing the squad tied for 16th place with No. 17 Oklahoma State, one of the event’s six ranked teams.
Coming into the contest, the Crimson had put together a string of sensational finishes, finding itself near the top of the team leaderboards in nearly all of its matches — second at the Dartmouth Invitational, fourth at the Princeton Invitational, and sixth at the Yale Invitational.
The Stanford Invitational, however, proved to be a different challenge. Of the 17-team field, six ranked in the top 20 nationally with powerhouses No. 2 UCLA and host No. 6 Stanford highlighting the top of the field.
“It’s different from a lot of the other competitions we play just in the quality of the teams that were invited,” first-year Anina Ku said. “We’re just taking all the positives away from it.”
Among individual finishers, the Crimson showed a great deal of consistency, especially from top finishers Ku and senior captain Michelle Xie. Over 54 holes, the pair registered aggregate scores of 223, going (73-74-76) and (75-74-74) respectively over the three days.
Significantly, the duo logged these scores under difficult conditions. Greater yardage, trickier hole design, and faster, drier conditions than many Northeastern courses required a great deal of patience and poise.
“The course was definitely tough, and you just had to really be patient because you could set yourself up nicely a lot of times, and then the putt just wouldn’t fall,” said Ku, who also happened to lead the team with four birdies.
Xie echoed a similar thought, explaining that “just being patient most of the time” was critical as she followed close behind Ku with three birdies of her own.
Rounding out the team’s scoring, senior Anna Zhou and sophomore Jessica Luo also tied each other, posting aggregate scores of 230, and sophomore Belinda Hu followed one stroke behind at 231.
Unranked Southern California surged to the top of the leaderboard, winning the tournament with a dominant score of 837 and upsetting the six ranked teams in the field. No. 6 Stanford, No. 11 Northwestern, No. 14 Washington, and No. 13 Arizona State all performed strongly, finishing in second, third, fourth, and tied for fifth, respectively, with the Sun Devils sitting even with Florida State in the five spot.
No. 2 UCLA had a disappointing weekend, closing out in ninth place. Washington State and Denver finished three strokes ahead of Harvard at plus-50 on the week.
“Facing a more competitive field always makes us more motivated to be better ourselves,” Xie said. “We want to be able to make it to NCAAs, and if we go to regionals, those would be the types of teams that we would be facing.”
Notably, of the five competitors for the Crimson, three were sophomores or younger. Of the nine-member team (four players did not participate at Stanford), Xie and Zhou are the only seniors.
With the fall season now in the books, Xie says that the Crimson’s effort to maintain its playing abilities through the winter will prove crucial to the team’s success in the spring. Until then, Harvard will look forward to its first match of the new season, the Harvard Invitational at Orange County National Golf Center in Orlando, Fla., on March 30-31.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s coming down to the wire in freshman Harry Walker’s second match in the singles portion of the Dartmouth Big Green Invite. After a tough battle in an incredibly contested match, Walker ultimately pulls away with a win that sends him to the finals of his flight — a final match from which he also emerges victorious in an equally close fashion, 6-4, 6-3 against freshman Owen Lu of Boston University.
“The [second round] match was tight the whole time, and it came down to just a couple of points,” said Walker, the South Salem, N.Y., native. “That really gave me confidence for the final.”
This performance was indicative of the entire Crimson men’s tennis squad’s showing over the weekend. Senior Michael Peters also won the championship of his flight, dominating the court against freshman J.P. Avila, also from Boston University, in a 6-0, 6-1 victory. Walker and Peters commanded their flight as a doubles team, defeating two teams from Buffalo to take home the championship. The two were undefeated in all matches over the weekend, in both singles and doubles. Additionally, senior Samuel Beren moved past Brown University junior Peter Litsky in an impressive third set tie-breaker, but fell in the semifinals of his flight.
“Everybody was serving and returning very well. This gave us the upper hand and put a lot of pressure on our opponents,” Walker said. “We [also] adjusted well to the indoor courts, having not played indoors very much. We just [have to] stay more aggressive and stay focused when we’re up.”
Harvard will look to ride out this momentum as the fall season begins to come to a close at Wake Forest in the second week of November.
“It was a very strong weekend to build off of,” Walker added. “It was really great to see everybody supporting each other.”
Back home at the Murr Center Tennis Courts, the women’s tennis team had an equally strong showing as the men did on the road. In the Harvard Fall Scramble, Harvard played against Fordham, Seton Hall, and Rhode Island on days one, two, and three, respectively. Across the three days, the Crimson won eight doubles matches and 15 singles matches — seven of which were won by first years. The presence of first-years on the court was undeniable.
“This was our first home tournament for the freshmen, and they all had strong performances,” junior Lexi Milunovich said. “We really supported each other.”
First-years Rachel Lim and Chelsea Williams had a strong 6-0 victory in a doubles match against Fordham, and both won singles matches individually as well. Williams also picked up victories against both Seton Hall and Rhode Island in singles play, and against Rhode Island in a doubles match with fellow first year Annika Bassey. Bassey also picked up victories in singles competition against Rhode Island and Seton Hall.
It was not just the first years that found success on the courts, however. Milunovich took home two straight-set victories against Fordham and Seton Hall, as well as a 6-3 doubles win against Fordham with her partner, sophomore Anna Li. Li picked up a second 6-3 doubles win against Rhode Island, and two straight-set singles wins against Rhode Island and Seton Hall. Junior Irene Lu, senior Isabel Jasper, sophomore Neha Gupta, and junior Natasha Gonzalez all also had commanding showings on the court, racking up three wins apiece.
In the weeks following, the women’s team will be preparing for the homestretch of the fall season. During the first weekend in November, the Crimson will host another tournament on its home court: the Harvard Invitational. This will be the last tournament in the season, and that Harvard team will certainly be looking to end the fall on a good note.
“It was a really exciting weekend,” said Milunovich, the New Canaan, Conn. native. “And we’re ready for our next home matches in the Invitational.”

It’s the best time of the year — just consider the temperature sweet spot, the optimal fashion choices (we love a good layered look), and the beautiful landscapes. The end of October may soon be approaching, but the month has so much to offer. Before you start complaining about the first temperature dip below 40, just remember that it’s about to get a whole lot colder, so appreciate it while you can. While you’re studying for midterms or if you’re feeling lonely on the cusp of cuffing season, don’t forget to stop and smell the Pumpkin Spice Latte and try to remember that we’re actually halfway through the semester.
Sugar, Spice, and Everything Nice
Who doesn’t love a good PSL, pie, or apple cider? October foods are actually the best — the tantalizing smell of cinnamon and the wholesome fun of apple and pumpkin picking are truly the trademarks of fall. This is the one time of the year when you can enjoy these simple comforts with relatively little judgement, so go forth and indulge.
Sweater Weather!
Finally, sweater weather has hit with full force. While some complain about the ever-fluctuating Boston fall weather, sweaters are an essential piece to any successful October outfit. Sweaters somehow represent the marriage of form and function, and they’ll be here for you with a cozy hug even if you miss the cuffing season train.
The Trees
Take a look at the Yard, Boston Commons, or any friendly neighborhood tree and you’ll be greeted by the beautiful reds, oranges, and yellows that are the essence of fall. Bring your basic vibes to the max by keeping a daily foliage counter on Snapchat and documenting the journey of every last tree into winter.
Last but (certainly) not least...Halloween
Whether you’re hitting up the parties or just love a good excuse to watch horror movies and eat some chocolate, you cannot deny that Halloween is a cornerstone of the Fall Experience. Situated right at the end of the month — bordering “spooky season” and the Thanksgiving/Christmas hype — Halloween is truly a time to adopt a new persona with every costume that you wear. As a bonus, November 1st is the optimal time to stock up on some nice discounted candy and maybe even start listening to Christmas tunes. Remember: it’s never too early to get in the holiday spirit.
So go out there, put on your favorite blanket scarf, and embrace this glorious last week of October.
