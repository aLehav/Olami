In today’s ever-expanding television landscape, it is all too easy for phenomenal shows to fall through the cracks. As more and more A-list actors migrate to the small screen, critical buzz and praise seems to focus the majority of its attention on such powerhouse productions. However, amidst all this glitz and glamor hides one of television’s funniest, most creative, and underrated comedies: “What We Do in the Shadows.” This FX series, available to stream on Hulu, is currently airing its third season. And just as the first two seasons were masterclasses in niche, absurdist humor, the third season soars at every turn.
“What We Do In The Shadows” is based on the 2014 film of the same name and follows the day-to-day lives of four vampires and their human assistant (known as a “familiar”) living in modern day Staten Island. As previously stated, this show is a tad absurd. However, its unabashed embracing of its own ridiculousness is what makes this show so wonderful.
The third season mainly focuses on the vampires’ new role of leading their local chapter of the Vampiric Council, a mystical group that operates out of the dingy basement of an office building. Here, Kayvan Novak’s character Nandor and Natasia Demetriou’s Nadja constantly bicker over the question of who should be deemed the supreme leader of the council. The sharp and biting dialogue shared between these two characters is eerily reminiscent of similar exchanges between Selina Meyer and her advisors on acclaimed comedy “Veep,” an immense credit to the writers of this show. Moreover, this spoken humor is perfectly paired with physical gags — a scene in which Nandor and Nadja try to find a way to share the supreme leader’s throne is a standout moment in the entire season.
Accompanying Nandor and Nadja on all of their journeys is Laszlo, Nadja’s husband, who is arguably the unsung hero of Season Three. Played by actor Matt Berry, much of Laszlo’s humor is based on making crude, overly sexual comments at every turn. While such a schtick could get tired after one or two jokes, Berry’s perfect delivery and unmatched ability to vary his intonation in unexpected ways make every line a winner. And just as the third season sees Nandor team up with Nadja, viewers are treated to the pairing of Laszlo and Mark Proksch’s Colin Robinson, a so-called “energy vampire” who uses mundane conversations to suck out people’s energy instead of their blood. The combination of Laslzo’s brazen sense of humor and Colin Robinson’s extremely dry, dad-like personality is one of the most welcome additions of Season Three, a truly genius choice on behalf of brilliant creative team, including Jermaine Clement and Taika Waititi. Look no further than the episode in which Laszlo and Colin try (and fail) to restore an antique car, humorously referred to as a jalopy, for evidence of this claim.
Besides standout performances from the show’s ensemble, “What We Do In The Shadows” also thrives due to its clever use of setting and cinematography. The show’s dark color palette and the gratuitously gothic setting of the vampires’ home successfully connects it to archetypal portrayals of vampires in popular culture. However, this depiction of vampire life is then humorously upended whenever the main characters find themselves in a brightly-lit grocery store, gym, or other typical twenty-first century setting. This visual gag of vampires in the real world is nowhere more prevalent than in the fourth episode of the third season, titled “The Casino.” In this episode, the whole cast of characters find themselves embarking on a journey to Atlantic City to celebrate their neighbors’ renewing their vows. The sight of Nandor, Nadja, and Laszlo, all sporting their dark and over-the-top vampire attire, and casually strolling past blackjack tables and slot machines is almost too good to be true. And the hijinks that ensue — Nandor becoming obsessed with a “The Big Bang Theory” themed slot machine, Laszlo and Nadja decorating the hotel room with a taxidermy bird brought from home, and Colin Robinson’s fascination with the promotional video for the casino — all cement this episode as the best of the season so far and one of the greatest of the entire series.
As its name suggests, “What We Do In The Shadows” does indeed lurk in the shadows of today’s star-studded television lineup, but that does not make it any less worthy of your attention. In fact, watching just one episode of this outlandish ensemble comedy will be enough to convince any viewer to keep watching what should rightly become one of the most popular shows on television.

Sound is to Death Cab for Cutie as light is to photography: a medium that can somehow overcome its impermanence to preserve moments in time. The Seattle-based alt-rockers’ ability to distill streams of memory into precise and evocative images became clearer than ever with the 2001 release of their third LP, “The Photo Album.” To celebrate the album’s 20th anniversary, the band shared a deluxe edition with previously unreleased material, such as acoustic versions and demos, on Oct. 29. Like a loving restoration of a cherished photo collection, the reissue provides new insight into the creation of a Death Cab classic.
Lead singer Ben Gibbard maintains a degree of melancholy detachment from his deeply personal lyrics, assuming the dual roles of photographer and subject. Far from alienating listeners, though, the distance in Gibbard’s delivery enables broader perspectives to grow from the album’s brief vignettes.
On album opener “Steadier Footing,” the austere backdrop of a lone guitar frames Gibbard’s equally pristine vocals as he recounts how the aftermath of a party brings “the chance I never got / To make a move.” Instead of taking that chance, Gibbard waxes nostalgic on “the people we’ve met in the last five years” as the accompaniment quickens. “And will we remember them in ten more?” he wonders. This synthesis of past and future signals a certain disregard for the present — a likely cause of the missed connection at hand. The acoustic demo features more complex harmonies whose full tone sometimes vies for attention with the lyrics, showing how the band’s subsequent studio work helped put “Steadier Footing” on its feet.
“The Photo Album” foreshadowed key elements of Death Cab for Cutie’s next release, 2003’s “Transatlanticism,” and twenty years’ time has only thrown these parallels into sharper relief. Gibbard concludes each chorus of “A Movie Script Ending” by repeating the word “highway” either four or eight times — a smaller-scale precursor to the heartbreaking refrain of “I need you so much closer” on the title track of “Transatlanticism.” The deluxe edition’s most obvious nod to “Transatlanticism” appears in a demo for “Information Travels Faster” with alternate lyrics, where Gibbard expresses his wish to “attach a tether a tether from here to there / And extend it from our wrists to span the Atlantic.”
With its staunch ambivalence toward Los Angeles, “Why You’d Want to Live Here” raises questions about the scenes we choose to capture either in memory or on film. “Is this the city of angels?” Gibbard asks on the band demo. He completes the question on the studio version: “Or demons?”
“I Was a Kaleidoscope,” another of the album’s singles, constructs a unique metaphor from the everyday occurrence of snow on eyeglass lenses. “And I was a kaleidoscope / The snow on my lenses distorting the image / Of what was only one of you,” Gibbard sings over a brash guitar riff. In a live acoustic performance for Seattle radio station KEXP that appears on the deluxe edition, the band’s more leisurely approach to the song still reflects the tension at its core.
The reissue also includes the three bonus tracks on the first CD pressing of “The Photo Album,” which Death Cab for Cutie later released as “The Stability EP.” In a press release, bass guitarist Nick Harmer noted the “crucial juncture” the band had reached before recording “The Photo Album.” They ultimately decided to pursue music full-time, resulting in what Gibbard called “the opportunity to push it all the way to the edge, personally and creatively, and go … This is worth saving. This is worth continuing to do.” In light of this realization, “The Photo Album (Deluxe Edition)” provides an especially distinct snapshot from Death Cab for Cutie’s career.

In a year of new normals, Khalid — thrust into stardom with the 2017 release of his album “American Teen” — takes a step in a new direction with his newest single, “Present.” In a slightly more trap-focused sound, Khalid branches away from his intimate and conversational tone while maintaining some of the personal notes which his fans have come to expect.
Although over two years have passed since his 2019 full album release “Free Spirit,” Khalid hasn’t slowed his production down, with a slurry of singles and collabs frequenting the charts. With a lot of big names bolstering the singles and one-offs, ranging from Ed Sheeran to Halsey and Martin Garrix, Khalid never limited himself and branched into pop and house.
The collabs and “Present” take a slightly different turn for the Georgian from Fort Stewart, while much of his two albums focuses on his incredible vocal talent and storytelling ability. Songs such as “8Teen” and “Location” from the debut “American Teen” tell sympathetic stories of young heartbreak, growing up, and navigating the maze of adulthood. These everyday stories paired with vocal maturity beyond his age create the stage where the artist could thrive and grow — reaching the top of the Billboard charts time and time again.
“Present” feels like a distinct move away from his tried and true consistency. While maintaining some of the trap-style elements of his hit “Young, Dumb, and Broke,” “Present” loses some vocal acuity and intensity. At times, the vocals are muffled under the sounds of bass and snare. “Present” feels more like a party song, with a loose sense of continuity and an emphasis on a strong beat. Rather than having the vocals be the centerpiece of the song, the ensemble takes over. The song even takes a more repetitive approach to the lyrics with a lot of weight on the chorus.
With such a distinct style, it is understandable that Khalid may want to try and break the mold he has built for himself. Khalid’s many songs have a similar sound and can sometimes blend into one another. Although great for full-album listening, these blurred lines between individual pieces can limit the noticeability and traction of the artist.
Perhaps as a branching point, “Present” may be the piece that Khalid uses to take a step away from the consistency of his previous music. In the previous years of constant change and fluidity, making a new brand could be an exciting step for the young artist. If Khalid’s new album “Everything Is Changing” takes the mood shown by “Present” and his previous single “New Normal,” it could be a rich and diverse step. “New Normal” follows more of the traditional stylistic choices of the artist with more subdued backup beats, so the album could be a mix of Khalid’s new style mixed in with the elements fans have come to know and love.
“Present” will be on Khalid’s new mixtape “Scenic Drive,” but whether it is incorporated alongside “New Normal” in his next full album is up for debate. “Scenic Drive” debuts Dec. 3 and is the companion to the 2018 EP “Suncity.” “Everything is Changing” is slated to be released sometime this fall. Both promise to be intriguing steps for the artist.

Just six months ago, Chloé Zhao was at the Academy Awards, smiling to the cameras with her two Oscars: Best Picture and Best Director. Now, fresh off the widespread acclaim from “Nomadland” (which The Crimson reviewed at The New York Film Festival), Zhao has written and directed “Eternals,” the latest Marvel superhero movie. Suffice to say, “Eternals” does not have much chance to win any above-the-line Oscars, nor does it flip the conventional Marvel formula on its head. But Zhao’s film is more introspective than many other films in the MCU. Its ambitious scope and strong emotional payoffs may take a few days to unpack, but they make “Eternals” a thoughtful viewing experience that lingers well after the credits roll.
Set over a period of 7,000 years and told from the perspective of 10 immortal extraterrestrials, “Eternals” compacts the entire MCU version of human history into 157 minutes. In the beginning, a celestial called Arishem created humans, but with them he also created Deviants, a supernatural species of sinewy monsters. When the Deviants start attacking humans, Arishem tries to correct his mistake by sending down the Eternals, all-powerful peacekeepers from the planet Olympus. After defeating the last Deviant and retiring in the 1500s, the Eternals find themselves — mysteriously and begrudgingly — drawn back to their duties in the present day.
Despite its massive scope, “Eternals” isn’t all blockbuster pomp. Much like her previous films, Zhao tries to keep “Eternals” human-centric, or in this case, Eternals-centric. The ensemble cast of characters all manage to be interesting in their own right, which is in large part due to clearly developed motivations and thoughtful character-driven discussions.
At its core, “Eternals” is a film about faith, purpose, and loyalty. These themes are explored through the central relationship between former lovers Sersi (Gemma Chan) and Ikaris (Richard Madden). Sersi is defined by her compassion, drawing strength from the people around her. But Ikaris has grown indifferent after millennia of existence, driven only by his love for Sersi and his faith in Arishem. It raises the question — what does it mean to have a purpose, and where does one find meaning when that purpose has withered away? In fame and riches, like Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani)? In the people around them, like Sersi and Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry)? Or in faith and duty, like Ajax (Salma Hayek) and Ikaris?
“Eternals” finds its beating heart in these quiet moments of self-discovery. All the Eternals start with a blind faith in Arishem — telling themselves that their choices, no matter how difficult or how cruel, are made for the greater good of humanity. But who should make the big decisions if the creator can no longer be trusted with the greater good? And can people truly change after centuries of devotion? As the film develops, and the morality of their mission grows murkier, cracks begin to widen between the Eternals. No one knows exactly what to do, and this honest uncertainty makes “Eternals” feel much more nuanced than other superhero films.
However, packing 7,000 years of story into one film also brings its caveats, and “Eternals” may be the most exposition-laden Marvel film yet. Zhao tries to make her film more digestible by integrating non-linear storytelling and using a slower pace to let “Eternals” breathe between extended bouts of exposition. However, some of Zhao’s choices compromise emotional involvement for easy accessibility. For instance, she reduces the Deviants to convenient CGI plot devices — villains that appear whenever the film needs a quick jolt of action. But that means that many of the action scenes involving Deviants feel dull, almost like they’re scripted to tick a checklist, rather than move the plot forward. Moreover, the slower, non-linear story means that it takes longer to get invested in the characters, which leaves some of the film’s bolder moments in its first act, like the first sex scene in the MCU, coming off as passionless.
In the leadup to the film’s release, renowned MCU producer Kevin Feige made sure to capitalize on Zhao’s big win at the Oscars, touting “Eternals” as a project unlike anything Marvel has done before. For instance, Zhao brings some of her independent filmmaking sensibilities to the table by shooting “Eternals” mostly on-location and using the longest average shot-duration in the MCU. The result often looks stunning on screen. But the contrast between the luscious cinematography and the conventional CGI fight scenes cheapen some of the film’s more powerful moments — especially its climax.
Despite uneven plotting, “Eternals” makes enough tweaks to the superhero formula to feel like a fresh take on an overplayed genre. Zhao’s latest isn’t exactly what Marvel fans expect — but by diminishing the action and doubling down on the characters, “Eternals” is more thought-provoking than many of its MCU peers. “Eternals” opens in theaters on Nov. 5.

Bay Area rapper Kevin Allen will never sell out.
In an interview with The Harvard Crimson, the rapper described his latest album “Nothing Lasts Forever” as a statement of his resolve to remain true to himself as an artist.
“Nothing Lasts Forever” was released on Oct. 29.
“There’s a matter of factness on the project,” Allen said. “I think that's due to my divorcing myself from the chase of what people would deem as popularity or fame.”
According to the rapper, the desire to maintain his creative integrity comes from a reverence for music-making as a site of personal discovery and growth.
“I don’t think that influence is a bad thing,” Allen said. “But, I've always prided myself on pushing the envelope, finding different flows, finding different styles in my music and rapping differently than someone else would.”
“Nothing Lasts Forever” was inspired by projects that pushed the boundaries of their respective genres — albums such as “A Seat at the Table” by Solange and Dr. Dre’s “The Chronic.”
Allen is the architect and founder of Grand Nationxl, a hip-hop collective and independent artist management firm that formed prior to the pandemic in 2020.
In addition to making music, the group’s goal is to reshape music industry standards around creativity and the well-being of artists, according to Allen.
“We want our music to be heard and we want it to be heard on a big platform, but we're careful to not chase what's popular just because everyone else is,” the rapper said.
His ninth studio album is the work of Kevin Allen, but it is also a product of Grand Nationxl.
Work first began on the project at the beginning of 2021 at The Reef, a recording studio in Oakland, CA that is the creative home of Grand Nationxl rapper and producer Mani Draper.
Together, Allen and Draper collaborated on the production that would become “Nothing Lasts Forever.” However, Allen largely credits Draper with formulating the sounds on the album.
“Mani built the foundation of the album,” Allen said. “He got a lot of the process done, so my production style for this album was less of a direction driver and more of a finishing touches type production.”
Draper’s work on “Nothing Lasts Forever” was the result of almost two years of crate digging at record shops around the world in search of the perfect sample.
“It's at least two summers worth of digging,” Draper said. “I would go in the summer from May to September — and especially pre-Covid when I spent a lot of time on the road — and from each city, come home with at least a crate.”
After gathering the raw materials, Draper organized his finds, regularly playing ideas for Allen at The Reef.
Working on “Nothing Lasts Forever” with albums by Solange, Dr. Dre, and Pharrell Williams as reference helped to shape the overall arc of the project, according to Draper.
“It's reverse engineering,” he said. “I think before we can ever identify as creators we are fans first.”
Another key reference to “Nothing Lasts Forever” was Pusha T’s 2018 album “Daytona,” a project that Draper revisited during a road trip with friends to Palm Springs in January 2021.
“We took the 101 on that scenic drive on the cliff with the water and the ocean; it was beautiful,” Draper said. “Listening to [Daytona] I could hear how intentional each chop was and how the sample was treated.”
Immediately after arriving in Palm Springs, Draper said that he wrote the beat for “Franklin Saint,” the second track on Allen’s album.
“I think he played me the [Franklin Saint] beat over the phone,” Allen said. “And I knew that that was the direction I needed to go in to start the project, like that's going to be number one and I knew it as soon as he sent me that beat.”
With “Franklin Saint” as a cornerstone, Allen built out the rest of “Nothing Lasts Forever,” with Draper and fellow Grand Nationxl member Brookfield Duece as key consultants.
As work continued, Allen called in features from Bay Area artists Ian Kelly, Jane Handcock, Rexx Life Raj, and Guapdad 4000. Although it is his solo project, Allen believes that making music is, at its core, a team sport.
“I feel like I have a higher probability of making something that works when I’m surrounded by a circle of writers, producers and people who've done exactly what I'm doing for just as long as I've been doing it,” Allen said.
According to Allen, one of the most involved collaborations on the project was the live version of “Franklin Saint,” which serves as the final song and bonus track.
Recorded at Zoo Labs in Oakland, the nine-minute live track was the result of Draper’s relationships with local bay area musicians.
“That was Mani’s Quincy Jones moment,” Allen said. “It was one of the most amazing things musically that I've been a part of. We filled the room with musicians and from the first time we hit play, they were in sync and they just knew what to do.”
With Allen at the front of the orchestra, the group made seven recordings of the track and ultimately decided to release the final take.
“Nothing Lasts Forever” is Allen’s ninth studio album, but the rapper said he doesn’t feel that he has changed all that much — rather that his latest project is a more complete statement of what he has always strived for: self-expression.
“I think at this point in my life I feel a lot more polished, but on the same trajectory,” the rapper said. “I didn’t try to make a hard left. I just tried to elevate the brand.”

Humans have long dreamed of going to space, and now, the wealthiest and most famous can buy the chance to make this vision a reality. Celebrities such as Tom Hanks, Angelina Jolie, Leonardo Dicaprio, and James Cameron have all purchased tickets to fly on an upcoming space flight. Several weeks ago, “Star Trek” actor and pop culture icon William Shatner became the oldest man to travel to space with Jeff Bezos and his aerospace company Blue Origin. Others, like Billie Eilish, have spoken out about their desire to do literally anything else.
This new “space craze” began in 2013 when Richard Branson, the CEO of spaceflight company Virgin Galactic, announced he was selling seats for a sub-orbital flight that would take its guests 50 miles up Earth’s atmosphere to the edge of space, all in the span of a few minutes. Ticket prices quickly jumped to $200,000, with a star-studded flight list of famous actors, musicians, and billionaires among the first to book their spots. Jeff Bezos’ space mission for wealthy patrons took place aboard the vessel New Shepard, which blasted off just a few weeks ago with Shatner and several other crew members. Both businessmen have evidently foreseen the potential rise of space tourism as an industry funded by the ultra-rich. With the one-percenters already able to indulge their every other whim, who’s not to say they can’t go to space too?
Some celebrities chose to purchase tickets for reasons related to the production of their art. Singer and pop star Lady Gaga intends to be the first person to sing in space, and a source told Us Weekly that she plans to take a month of vocal training to prepare for this bizarre experience. Fellow pop singer and ticket holder Justin Bieber even floated the possibility of filming a music video in space.
The idea of capitalizing on the allure of space to boost an artist’s image and connect with their audience in a fresh way can be seen as a bold and brilliant PR move. After all, many people have dreamed of going to space in some way or another, and the prevalence of space-related content in media cannot be understated. William Shatner himself appeared on TV screens for decades traversing the “last frontier“ as the iconic Captain Kirk before journeying to actual space for a few minutes. Recent trending content in pop culture has also capitalized on the allure of space, from Disney+’s space epic “The Mandalorian” to Dua Lipa’s galaxy-themed song “Levitating.”
Frankly, the idea of a music video or live performance in space is bizarre, if not totally extravagant and over-the-top. But maybe these artists are rightfully pushing the boundaries on how they make their mark on society and pop culture by leaping head-on into the starry abyss. Did we not give them the role of entertainer, creator, innovator, and storyteller of the human experience through our collective investment in their art? Perhaps it is not so wrong that they seek out something wholly bigger than themselves.
Other celebrities have admitted that they want to go to space simply to satisfy a personal whim. According to a source, Rihanna told The Hamilton Spectator that she “has been obsessed with space since she was a child, so it would be a dream come true for her” to travel via Branson’s rocket.
Pop star Katy Perry also bought tickets for her husband Russell Brand and herself aboard the Virgin Galactic flight. In an interview with MTV News she said: "I'm so into extraterrestrial stuff... It's very difficult for me to look up into the sky in the middle of the night and not think that our planet is one of... a bajillion.” Her captivation with the mystique of space reflects that of many, though for most of history we have been grounded by the limitations of our technology.
With space becoming relatively more accessible to those who can afford it, the industry of space tourism is likely going to have a meteoric rise. If one is set on going to space, why not invest more money on research, perhaps to send astronauts to carry out scientific missions or rovers to probe the depths of our solar system? Many rocket launches occur to the detriment of the climate as well, so it also may be more prudent to focus on solving these problems on earth.
Branson and Bezos, both titans of the space industry, have invested vast amounts of their resources into luxury commercial space flights instead, offering the rich an opportunity to partake in a profound experience that is inaccessible to most. Space can be seen as truly worthy of great exploration, but one can wonder if the act of commodifying space travel as a product only available to the ultra-rich cheapens our collective interaction with this final frontier.
After returning from his stint in microgravity aboard the New Shepard Rocket, Shatner offered some initial thoughts and impressions. He described his own experience as moving, extraordinary, and unforgettable, and his words speak to that mystique of space that has captured the imagination of so many and driven humanity to reach for this next frontier.
In a video of Shatner outside the capsule, he is apparently overcome with emotion, struggling to speak as his eyes well with tears. “Everybody in the world needs to do this. Everybody in the world needs to see. It was unbelievable,” he says in the video. “I experienced something so emotional about life and death, and the destruction of the planet, and the preciousness of everything that I'm connected with.” What he failed to mention was how his own flight — and space tourism in general — could be contributing to that destruction.
It is regrettable that most of humanity will probably be unable to witness this moving experience, yet while Shatner’s words may feel out of touch in this regard, his message is still one that we can learn from. The wonder of space that is captured so well by Shatner’s words may serve instead to fuel our interest in exploring this last great frontier.
The idea of experiencing the absoluteness of space can be a deeply profound and wonderful thing. Yet it is hard to ignore the feeling that our energy and resources should first and foremost go towards the potentially more useful pursuits of research and advancing more urgent, earthly needs. The wonder of space that shaped Shatner’s experiences and the vision of other artists should serve to fund important research rather than indulge the rich’s delights. However, the ultra-wealthy have always been able to soar above the rest of us, and perhaps they still may offer us meaningful takeaways from their journeys in microgravity. As storytellers and creators of art that speaks truth to the human experience, these celebrities can enable our interest in space to flourish through their imparting of its wonders through words and music.

“Attack on Titan” has swiftly become one of the most iconic anime of all time.
Originally penned by Japanese artist Hajime Isayama in 2009, the eponymous manga is one of the world’s best-selling series with over 100 million copies in circulation. The beloved anime adaptation — commonly referred to by fans as “AOT” — debuted in 2013, with the fourth and last season’s final episodes slated to air in January of 2022.
Set in a world where humans live in constant fear of carnivorous humanoid titans, AOT follows the trio of Eren, Mikasa, and Armin. The three childhood friends live in an insular rural village until their lives are changed irreversibly by a sudden titan invasion. Traumatized by the carnage they witness, the triumvirate resolves to join the Survey Corps, the arm of the government that trains soldiers to fight titans. As the protagonists pursue their training, they encounter a host of eclectic characters, all the while learning about the ancient creatures that threaten the future of human existence.
And yet, ask any “Attack on Titan” fan who their favorite character is. Chances are nine in ten, if not more, won’t list any one of the three protagonists.
Instead, they’ll opt — with a wistful sigh — for someone by the name of Levi Ackerman.
Levi Ackerman is the quintessence of that male anime character who has it all. He’s handsome and stoic, valiant and ruthlessly talented. Captain of the Survey Corps’ elite Special Operations Squad, he is commonly referred to as “humanity’s strongest soldier,” easily surpassing the collective fighting power of a battalion. You think he hates you because he won’t talk to you, and then he saves your life. Levi’s brooding, quiet darkness is complicated by rare gestures of compassion — glimpsed moments of vulnerability that add fuel to his mystery, and are undoubtedly the cause for much swooning.
But don’t just take my word for it. Google him. The internet is chock-full of Levi fanfictions, Tumblr posts, fan-made music videos, laptop stickers, playlists, and more.
The playlists are particularly telling. Most feature sultry, atmospheric songs from artists including The Neighborhood, Lana Del Rey, Labrinth, Arctic Monkeys, and Cigarettes After Sex. There's a dark, sensual, and arguably self-indulgent melodrama to the music fans associate with the character — and an ostentatious yearning, too. Some notable playlist titles include “silently watching stars with levi while levi stares at you,” “bullying marleyan warriors with levi,” “falling in love with levi ackerman,” and “Having seggs with Levi: a playlist - Slowed + Revrb.” Hey — their words, not mine.
Yes, these Levi-inspired playlists are a damning exposé of adolescent horniness. Beyond that, though, it is notable that each of the four titles mentioned above speak to a simulated relationship. Levi has not merely engrossed fans across the world. He has morphed into a parasocial receptacle — a sort of virtual lover — through which consumers of Isayama’s content contend with and claim their own sexual desires.
There are a slew of complicated factors that contribute to this wealth of fan-made material. One is that media consumers, particularly younger folks, feel comfortable being outright about their sexual fascination with characters who are not real; the vast majority of people who create these meticulous, imaginative renderings of Levi are likely tweens. There is something at once disappointing and liberating about the fact that their desires for a particular character, fervent as they are, will not spill over into the real world. The awareness enables them to express a sexuality they know will remain contained within their digital lives — a broader trend that relates to stan culture at large.
But what makes the craze around Levi distinct from other fandoms? By all means, Levi exhibits the classic features of the “bad boy” trope. However, the convergence of features that form his identity are unique, and particularly reflective of broader trends of masculine portrayal in anime. The androgynous features, stoicism, and repressed emotionality that make Levi so enchanting to many viewers are relatively commonplace. Levi marks one of many successful installments in a tradition of male anime characters who exhibit similar, if not identical, visual and behavioral traits — qualities that at once conform to and break free of traditional conceptions of gender.
Take, for example, “Naruto”’s Itachi Uchiha. Frequently lauded as one of the most captivating villains in contemporary anime history, Itachi exhibits incredibly similar traits to Levi. Like Levi, has also been fawned over by generations of viewers. A genius ninja and brother of the show’s deuteragonist Sasuke Uchiha, Itachi is feared and loathed for decimating his entire clan — save Sasuke, whom he spares the night of the carnage. Often depicted in an elegant black robe patterned with bold red clouds — denoting the insignia of “Akatsuki,” the rogue criminal organization to which he belongs for most of the show — Itachi is ethereal and elegant. He derives his power from genjutsu, a fighting style that uses illusory techniques to defeat opponents. Tied-back raven hair framing his delicate features, Itachi rarely speaks and is characterized by a restrained, unsettling melancholy. He is recurrently associated with the feminine moon, as opposed to the more traditional masculine symbol of the sun. One of the most memorable scenes of Itachi in the entire show features the antagonist looking back at the strewn corpses of the kin he has murdered, his beautiful face paled by the moon as he sheds a single, luminous tear.
Dozens of other male characters from a broad range of anime corroborate this trend. Some of the most striking examples include Kurapika from “Hunter X Hunter,” Soo-Won from “Yona of the Dawn,” Alucard from “Hellsing Ultimate” (and “Castlevania,” for that matter), Sebastian Michaelis from “Black Butler,” Ken Kaneki from “Tokyo Ghoul,” Haku from “Spirited Away,” and Sesshōmaru from “Inuyasha.” The trend is so widespread that it pushes us to consider its implications. What is it about the presentations of these male characters that make them so irresistible to fans?
There are a host of potential answers, a concise description of which runs the risk of sounding reductive or culturally myopic. For one, it is notable that animators from Japan, a country infamous for its rigid gender roles and enduring patriarchal tradition, have imagined their most alluring male characters in this style. By expressing their naked adoration of male characters that draw their memorability from traits frequently perceived as feminine — that is, sadness as opposed to anger, the moon as opposed to the sun, shrewdness as opposed to physical strength, delicacy as opposed to brute force, and restraint as opposed to impulsivity — fans, too, push back against traditional perceptions of what type of man it is “normal” or “acceptable” to be attracted to.
This aesthetic and behavioral trend by no means serves as an answer to a set of sociocultural questions. Moreover, we cannot talk about the complexity of gendered expression in anime without accounting for queerbaiting, homophobia, transphobia, and the woefully peripheral role women often play in action anime — topics that merit extended conversations of their own. Rather, this notable trend serves as a question unto itself, opening the possibility for more fluid and expansive understandings of gender, personhood, and the complexity of attraction.
Exceedingly often, anime gets a bad rap. It is perceived as a second-class or otherwise juvenile form of entertainment. And yet, anime — as well as the digital material it generates in its wake — is not only complex and intelligent, but also reveals important truths about the ways digital citizens contend with their own desires, and in doing so move toward a fuller understanding of themselves.

The peaceful sounds of waves crashing on an idyllic Caribbean beach join carnival dancers swaying their hips to and fro in the opening scene of the music video for “SG,” (short for Sexy Girls), the latest track from DJ Snake, Ozuna, Megan Thee Stallion and Blackpink’s Lisa. This 10-second scene is the last moment of calm before the hectic hurricane that hits this tropical music video.
The image of Meghan Thee Stallion writhing in a pool of water immediately breaks the moment of serenity. She is joined by Lisa from a set in Korea, DJ Snake from a yacht on a beach, and Ozuna from an undisclosed location. From the outset, this interesting cast of characters makes the collaboration even more chaotic by virtue of being in many different places at once. The temporal instability fragments the video and the sporadic cutaway scenes and neon light frame shifts further contribute to the viewer’s erratic experience.
Not only are they physically in different locations, each of the artist’s storylines are equally as disorganized. DJ Snake, for example, breaks up with his tour manager by text before going on vacation and breaking out some questionable dance moves with Ozuna. Meg’s intense eye contact threatens the viewer to keep watching her throw it back. Meanwhile, Lisa is left stranded in Korea, choppily edited into a low quality green screen during the group shoots and dancing like her rent is due.
The choreography could also not be more different for each of these characters. While Lisa is pirouetting and frolicking under the moon, Meg’s sole objective is making waves in the water, and Ozuna and DJ Snake undertake an interpretive performance of Drake’s dance from “Hotline Bling.”
The only question this music video proposes — and subsequently fails to address — is who exactly is the sexy girl in question? Is it Meg, twerking seemingly for attention? Is it the various carnival dancers whose faces flash like paroxystic afterthoughts? Or is it the hologram version of Lisa, zooming in for a guest appearance? All the audience knows for sure is that this music video has no proper direction, lacks a plot, and is four minutes too long.

The weather is getting colder. Fake skeletons, pumpkin patch Instagram photos, and Spirit Halloween stores have started popping up everywhere. It’s clear that fall is here, and what better way to embrace it than with an expertly-curated playlist? Read on for ten songs that are perfect for getting into a Halloween mood.
“This Is Halloween” by Danny Elfman (from “The Nightmare Before Christmas”)
Starting with a classic, the opening song of Tim Burton’s “The Nightmare Before Christmas” is perfectly creepy. In the movie, “This Is Halloween” serves to introduce the perpetually frightening Halloweentown and its residents, including Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King.
“Twilight Zone” by Golden Earring
This is an ’80s rock song that pays homage to the horror TV show “The Twilight Zone.” Its upbeat tune and eerie lyrics are a great way to get a room of people into the Halloween spirit. When you listen to this song, you’ll feel like you’re stepping into the Twilight Zone.
“Walking On Air” by Kerli
Inspired by scary children’s stories of the “In a Dark, Dark Room” variety, “Walking On Air” is a little, creepy song about a little, creepy girl. This song would have been on my playlist in middle school, and even a decade later, it still holds up as a quirky, atmospheric Halloween song.
“The Fine Art of Poisoning” by Jill Tracy
This one is frightening to the extreme. In the song, the narrator describes the various ways to poison an enemy and gloats about getting away with it. With a haunting voice, Jill Tracy sings, “Misfortune will flow / But who will know?” Play this one during a dinner party for added effect.
“Mx. Sinister” by I DONT KNOW HOW BUT THEY FOUND ME
iDKHOW’s “Mx. Sinister” is about a stalker obsessed with making their victim fall in love with them. In this creepy and vaguely disturbing (but gender-inclusive!) song, lead vocalist Dallon Weekes sings, “I’ve got to make you mine / Just know I’m not the sinister type.”
“Spooky, Scary Skeletons (Undead Tombstone Remix)” by Andrew Gold
Skeleton memes aside, you cannot deny that this song is a perfect Halloween tune. Specifically, the remix — as opposed to the original song — is on this list because of its increased danceability and fabulous beat drop. And while over half of the words are either “spooky,” “scary,” or “skeletons,” what else do you really need on Halloween?
“Halloween” by Phoebe Bridgers
If you’re trying to refine your Spotify Unwrapped at the last minute while simultaneously enjoying the spirit of the fall season, this is the song to play on repeat. While not exactly about the holiday itself — it’s about a couple trying to pretend they don’t have problems — the song technically takes place on Halloween. And hey, dying relationships can be scary too!
“Disturbia” by Rihanna
Speaking of Halloween songs that aren’t actually about Halloween, Rihanna’s “Disturbia” always seems to get placed in the “Halloween” category despite never mentioning the holiday during the song. Still, the imagery of “a thief in the night to come and grab you,” along with the song’s generally disturbing sound, makes this a Halloween staple.
“Peek-a-Boo” by Red Velvet
K-pop girl group Red Velvet’s best song was released alongside a horror-inspired music video in which the five members lure an unwitting pizza boy into their house to be killed. The whole song has a mysterious aura, with an addictive “peek-a-peek-a-boo” hook that will get stuck in your head.
“Monster Mash” by Bobby “Boris” Pickett
This is the quintessential Halloween song. You cannot go to a Halloween party without this song playing at least once. This instantly recognizable song has everything — a dancing mad scientist, ghostly sound effects, and a band of coffin-bangers called the Crypt-Kickers. It is, indeed, a graveyard smash.

With the imminent release of her sophomore album on Nov. 5, Summer Walker’s marketing strategies just keep getting better. Fans of her work may recall when she teased her 2019 debut studio album, “Over It,” with exclusive pink phone booths across various cities in the US and Canada. Branded the “Over It Hotline,” the phone booths allowed fans to listen to snippets of her album — whose cover featured Walker on her very own pink phone — and leave her voicemails with their thoughts.
In the weeks leading up to Nov. 5, Walker again plays with innovative promotion techniques, fans’ desire for exclusive access, and ways to interact directly with her audience by leaving the entirety of her second album — titled “Still Over It” — on a hard drive in sealed glass cases across US cities.
An album that leaves a legacy is like any steamy relationship — it has a sleek idea to pull you in, an intimate relationship with the artist cultivated through raw lyrics and emotive beats, and ownership over the specificity and personalization of this relationship. It’s what we crave in our conventional romances: attraction, relatability, and exclusivity.
Walker’s promotion techniques take advantage of just that; these glass cases are just enough to tempt curious audiences in the city, or incite drastic measures from fans. Fans in New York, Chicago, and Atlanta attempted to break open the lid of these cases with the pink hammers attached to the box, and a lucky few have been successful. The hard drive of “Still Over It” even has its own Instagram page, which has garnered over 125K followers.
In addition to announcements of the next city every week, the page boasts reactions from the winners who were able to break the glass case and grab the hard drive first. Five winners from New York City complimented both the artistry and the vulnerability of the album. “I appreciate the dedication, I appreciate the lyricism, I appreciate the love, and the pain,” one fan said.
With posts on the page nearly every day and less than a week left before the release of Walker’s second album, the R&B artist is still keeping the spirit of her pink phone booths alive. Inviting listeners to text her on why they’re “still over it,” Walker maintains her personal relationships with fans. We can only expect the sexiest, sassiest of songs on Friday.

For the past few years, celebrity collaborations with fast fashion brands have become a staple in the fashion market. While seemingly bringing celebrities’ favorite designs to the general public in an affordable way, these partnerships promote unethical clothing consumption, the abuse of garment workers, and dangerous environmental practices, all while making celebrities and their brand partners millions of dollars.
Fast fashion, while relatively new as a term, has existed in practice for decades. Producing more clothing more frequently led to it being made cheaply, cost-efficiently, and unsustainably. Because celebrities, along with their fashion, are so prevalent in mainstream media, the general public often draws inspiration from their faves and seeks to emulate their style. Brands capitalize on this: Celebrities wear expensive designer clothing, so the demand for cheaper alternatives has grown. The fashion industry’s goal for decades now has been to produce more clothes cheaper and faster, in part to keep up with the latest celeb fashion trends and demand for popular alternatives. That practice, arguably, played a big role in leading up to today’s popular fast fashion brands like Shein, Fashion Nova, Nasty Gal, and countless others. Quickening trend cycles throughout the decades — and especially over the course of the last five years — mean that designs seen on designer catwalks can be reproduced and ready to sell in as little as a week.
Recently, however, celebrities have become more than just inspirations for fast fashion. They’ve become promoters of it.
Cardi B’s collaboration with Fashion Nova in 2018 was one of the most successful partnerships between a brand and a celebrity, gaining a lot of recognition and making nearly $1 million in the first 24 hours of its launch. Cardi B’s history as a genuine consumer of the brand prior to gaining fame added an air of authenticity. The collection sought to show that Cardi B wouldn’t get on a high horse and promote expensive clothes to her fans because she identifies with the struggle of wanting to be fashionable on a budget.
By supporting Cardi B in this collaboration, though, consumers increased the profits of a company that underpays its workers and then feigns ignorance of their struggle. Garment workers in factories that produce clothes for Fashion Nova are paid per seam and often make the equivalent of $2-$5 an hour. Fashion Nova claims no responsibility for this, since they work with numerous manufacturers and assume the low prices they get are possible with workers being paid minimum wage.
Cara Delevingne’s 2019 collection with Nasty Gal was another example of the now-ubiquitous celebrity fast fashion partnership. Delevingne was also ostensibly a Nasty Gal consumer, wearing the brand’s pieces to music festivals before her collaboration. Yet Nasty Gal’s comfortable and trendy clothes wreak devastating environmental havoc, from the byproducts of factory production seeping into rivers, to microfibers from washing fast fashion clothing polluting oceans.
Though the brand has made promises to disclose their factory lists by 2021 and map out their supply chains by 2025, it doesn’t provide detailed information on its commitment to an ethical and sustainable supply chain as well as methods of enforcing the standards it claims to have. Nasty Gal pushes the more sustainable options of their organic cotton denim line and vintage clothing, yet doesn't mention expanding sustainability to the rest of their store. Perhaps most importantly, fast fashion’s quick turnaround of new designs promotes overconsumption and has damaging environmental impacts — often regardless of the materials used. Delevingne’s partnership, therefore, further amplified these harmful means of production.
Despite these harmful effects of fast fashion brand collaborations, they are still prevalent in today’s fashion world. Megan Fox launched her collaboration with Boohoo on Oct. 19, which gave her creative freedom to express her sense of style with an affordable price tag.
Fast fashion collaborations can have important social motivations, like Ashley Graham’s Pretty Little Thing collection, which purports to prioritize inclusivity at its core. The spring-themed collection focused on body-positivity and inclusive sizing. Making trendy clothing accessible to more people is certainly valuable. But doing so by working with a fast-fashion brand will only exacerbate the negative ethical and environmental impacts of celebrity-inspired consumption.
Celebrity collaborations promoting clothing lines with larger sizes but with more sustainable fashion brands, like Reformation or Everlane (both of which currently struggle with size inclusivity), can give consumers a choice between fast-fashion and sustainable fashion they didn’t have before — a partnership perhaps lower in profit for the celebrity, yet more beneficial for the consumer and the environment. Yet these seemingly sustainable alternative brands to fast fashion clothing still have issues: Any brand which promotes a constant trend cycle cannot be truly sustainable.
H&M, while advertising their Conscious brand focused on utilizing sustainable materials, still underpays their workers, and Everlane provides little evidence of their material commitment to sustainable initiatives. There are affordable alternatives to fast fashion as well, like thrifting and buying second hand clothing, saving it from landfills and incorporating vintage styles into your wardrobe.
Celebrity fast fashion collaborations are a natural next step in the fashion industry’s history and the incessant push for higher profits. Celebrities also hold an enormous amount of power over the general public, which makes them the perfect media marketing tool. As the negative ethical and environmental repercussions of fast fashion permeate mainstream media and buying $1,000 worth of clothes from Shein becomes less trendy, however, celebrities have fewer and fewer excuses for partnering with brands that exhibit questionable production practices.

Wes Anderson’s distinct filmmaking style remains dreamy. His latest film “The French Dispatch,” which The Crimson reviewed at Cannes, is set in the fictional town of Ennui-Sur-Blasé, France. In this fanciful setting, a group of writers’ stories for the film’s fictional eponymous newspaper come to life after the death of their beloved editor-in-chief, Arthur Howitzer Jr. (Bill Murray). Anderson structures his film as a theatrical anthology featuring three distinct central stories and their writers: “The Concrete Masterpiece” by J.K.L. Berensen (Tilda Swinton), “Revisions to a Manifesto” by Lucinda Krementz (Frances McDormand), and “The Private Dining Room of the Police Commissioner” by Roebuck Wright (Jeffrey Wright). In 108 action-packed, quirky minutes, Anderson pays homage to the exceptional real-life writers and journalists that inspired the film. But the film isn’t just witty and lovable because of its premise: Anderson pays undivided attention to costuming and set design, making “The French Dispatch” an unforgettable tribute.
Herbsaint Sazerac (Owen Wilson), who writes “The Cycling Reporter,” claims the first standalone chapter of the film. Sazerac appears in dark green khakis and a long sleeve beige pullover, complemented by a black beret and a camera strapped around his neck. As Sazerac narrates cycling through “a day in Ennui,” each set in his village is given intricate visual detail and a rich history, embodying the symmetry and pastel scenery that typifies Anderson’s unique vision and, in the context of the movie, springs from the magazine writers’ imaginations. His vintage orange bicycle is not just a stylized way to journey across this small town but also a symbol of the setting’s charming appeal. As a classic reporter in both attire and demeanor, Sazerac acts as a familiar guide to the audience, breaking the fourth wall to literally invite the audience through his story.
But this is no understated tale, and Anderson has more quirkiness to offer. Each article in Howitzer’s magazine consists of climactic and often humorous backstories with characters that, in true Anderson fashion, are eccentric and surreal. For instance, the melodramatic J. K. L. Berensen (Tilda Swinton) presents a hilarious tale of a prisoner-turned-artist in “The Concrete Masterpiece.” The writer’s absurdity is reflected in her orange and yellow attire, red hair, and gold jewelry. Her costuming validates the theatrical and artful story she tells, as well as her infatuation with artist Moses Rosenthaler (Benicio Del Toro).
In “Revisions to a Manifesto,” Anderson switches up his visual style again: This time, the costumes and coloring embody a formal and muted academic aesthetic. College radical Zeffirelli (Timothée Chalamet) is a helpless teenager in a perfectly-tailored grey suit. Against the mustard yellow of the Sans Blague cafe, his dark suit is complemented by a form-fitting black sweater underneath, a cigarette, and an obviously deliberate messy shag. Juliette (Lyna Khoudri), another teenage character, sports a brown leather jacket and a knee-length plaid skirt — half-teen, half-revolutionary. Both of these characters want to be taken seriously, and their wardrobes reflect their resulting anxiety and inadvertent narcissism.
Anderson’s set design adds another layer of meaning to his characters beyond their candid delivery of lines and unconventional outfits. His focus on aesthetics turns every shot into a visual embodiment of fabulously-detailed magazine writing. “The Concrete Masterpiece” is an easy-to-miss example of this artistry. The prison inhabited by artist Moses Rosenthaler and his prison guard muse, Simone, is carefully scrubbed of any color or detail. The set’s grey-and-white walls, wooden floors, miscellaneous scaffolding, and greyscale high ceilings do not seem to warrant a second glance. Yet, on closer inspection, the black and white adds an illusory, balanced lens to the cinematography. Much like Rosenthaler’s character itself, the prison’s atmosphere feels somewhat inscrutable. In one scene, art buyer Julien Cadazio (Adrien Brody) attempts to learn more about the artist as the grey smoke from both their cigarettes subtly blends into their backgrounds. But Rosenthaler is imprisoned, emotionally unavailable, and throws tantrums to create his art, which resembles children’s drawings. The implied seriousness of his dull black and white setting amplifies and even pokes fun at the ridiculousness of J. K. L. Berensen’s story. The sets in “The French Dispatch” are themselves reliable narrators and are the reason that audiences buy into the world that each writer has created.
Needless to say, “The French Dispatch” builds on Anderson’s popular filmmaking style, and his well-established artistic choices work well as affectionate depictions of the creative minds of writers. It is as Wes Anderson as a viewing experience can get, not just because it is made up of quaint characters, sets, and costumes, but because his aesthetic goes hand-in-hand with the film’s premise. Nothing is more imbued with nostalgia than a storybook come to life.

It’s been over a week since a prop gun misfired on the set of the upcoming Western film “Rust,” injuring director Joel Souza and tragically taking the life of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. An outpouring of support has resulted in Hutchins’ family’s GoFundMe more than surpassing its initial goal of $225k and Alec Baldwin, who fired the prop gun, has reportedly been inconsolable. This has been a time to remember Hutchins, 42, who had worked on more than 30 films, TV shows and miniseries throughout her career. It has also been a time to call for better work practices in the entertainment industry. Halyna Hutchins’ death is a tragedy that could have and should have been prevented, and it therefore has sparked many important conversations around workplace safety and workers’ rights.
Some people, however, have responded to the news in a very different matter.
Donald Trump Jr. is now selling t-shirts with the slogan “Guns don’t kill people Alec Baldwin kills people” on his website. It’s available in four colors for $27.99, and everything from the idea to its execution is unbelievable.
Trump Jr. is obviously referencing the popular pro-gun slogan: “Guns don’t kill people, people do.” Except, it was because of the intrinsic danger of guns that someone was killed. This tragedy could not have happened if guns were not being used on set. The “prop” weapon (a clear misnomer, since this is not the first time that the use of one on set has resulted in a fatal injury) was improperly handled, as Baldwin was told the gun was unloaded. The presence of this weapon on-set, and the lack of safe working conditions which caused many of the film’s crew to walk off set hours before the tragedy, were major contributing factors in this tragedy in the first place. The fatal consequences that can come from gun-related accidents are something that gun control activists have been drawing attention to for years. And yet, Trump Jr., who has notably been pro-gun, seems to be ignoring this fact altogether. In effect, he seems to be mocking his own point of view. Or is he not cognizant of what these words actually mean?
Even setting aside the disrespect implicit in making a joke t-shirt inspired by a person’s death, the shirt still fails on a humor level as well. Its attempt at satire doesn’t work because the shirt isn’t ironic, it’s just crudely referencing a tragedy. It isn’t a witty clap back and it isn’t a valid political message. It actually doesn’t make any sense.
But perhaps Trump Jr. isn’t trying to make a point. Perhaps this is just a shameless publicity stunt. After all, Alec Baldwin impersonated Donald Trump during his presidency in several satirical skits on SNL, and Baldwin has also been outspoken in favour of gun control. Trump Jr. clearly thinks he’s doing something here by capitalizing on his name at such an awful time. In fact, Trump Jr. is also selling t-shirts and hoodies with the slogan “Fauci kills puppies,” so clearly this is not a lesson learned.
Ultimately, this ploy is so tacky that the best thing we can do is ignore it.

1960s London: The bright neon lights of the city are blinding, live music spills out of club windows, and Sean Connery’s fourth Bond movie “Thunderball” is premiering at the nearest theater. According to Eloise Turner (Thomasin McKenzie), the protagonist of “Last Night in Soho,” there’s no better time to be alive. Edgar Wright’s psychological horror film transports viewers to the past as modern-day fashion student Eloise is whisked into the whirlwind of the Swinging Sixties every night in her dreams. The film features an alluring original premise, immersive worldbuilding, and a surprising feminist slant, but sometimes falls short of expectations as the story develops.
At the start of the film, Eloise moves from the quiet English countryside — where she was raised by her grandmother after her mother’s suicide — to London to study fashion. Unfortunately, she finds that college life isn’t all it’s cracked up to be: Eloise’s wealthy roommate Jocasta (Synnøve Karlsen) is patronizing and cruel (though often a scene stealer in her cutting comedic delivery), she’s overwhelmed by 24/7 partying, and she’s struggling to make friends. Unhappy in the dorms, Eloise rents a room off campus from an older woman named Mrs. Collins (Diana Rigg). It’s here that her nightly time travels begin, and in her dreams she begins to inhabit the life of Sandie (Anya Taylor-Joy), an aspiring singer.
Wright does an excellent job of juxtaposing Eloise’s disappointing college experience with glittering 1960s London, a place he initially depicts as brimming with promise. When she first walks into the Soho of the sixties, the sound switches from mono to surround, and the classic 1963 ballad “You’re My World” reaches a swelling peak. The volume is raised to a level that seems deliberately overwhelming: As Eloise gazes at the rich sensory overload around her, we take part in her astonishment. In this first act, Wright invites his audience to romanticize the past alongside Eloise.
The contrast between Eloise and Sandie is stark, and each actress is perfectly cast for their respective roles. McKenzie easily embodies Eloise’s timid, unsure nature, while Taylor-Joy brings vitality to the ambitious, self-possessed Sandie. In Eloise’s dreams, she both inhabits and orbits Sandie’s world — in a disorienting series of shots, Eloise is shown as Sandie’s reflection in mirrors, and sometimes vice versa. Other times, Eloise simply watches Sandie live her life, an invisible voyeur infatuated by her charisma and unyielding confidence. In the real world, Eloise begins to emulate Sandie, dyeing her hair blonde and buying a vintage jacket to resemble her. As the differences between them slowly collapse, their relationship makes for a captivating study in femininity, highlighting expectations imposed upon women while also poignantly depicting female solidarity.
The film takes a dark turn in both its tone and messaging as Sandie begins a relationship with Jack (Matt Smith), a charming and sinister manager who vows to make her into a star. This pivot in the story reveals the danger lurking beneath the glamour of the city, serving as a painful but timely reminder that women are often exploited if they want to “make it.” However, in addressing the pressing issue of patriarchal violence, Wright could have lended more nuance and depth to his protagonists. Sandie is rarely granted the time to reveal who she is outside of her ambitious starlet act; the script would have benefitted from exploring more deeply the dissonance between her internal world and the perpetual facade she keeps up.
While its timely themes are thoughtfully handled and Wright does give his female characters some agency, the film loses its footing in its latter half. The story becomes predictable as Eloise’s dreams of the past begin to impact her real life in the present, featuring one too many successive and unimaginitive chase sequences. There’s a romance subplot between her and another student, John (Michael Ajao), who is refreshing in his earnestness but ultimately lacks the development to make us truly care about him. In fact, by the end of the film, there are several characters and storylines that feel underdeveloped or disconnected from the central narrative. With its sleek, saturated production design that turns nostalgia into nightmare, “Last Night in Soho” is certainly an exciting ride. Nevertheless, it loses its verve as it unfolds and doesn’t quite live up to its potential as an innovative feminist horror film.

The wait is finally over. Adele released the lead single from her new album “30” with an accompanying music video six years after the release of her previous album “25.” “30” is a response to her divorce from Simon Konecki, which was finalized in 2019. In her British Vogue interview, she described this album as “self-destruction, then self-reflection, and then sort of self-redemption”.
A lot has happened for Adele and the world since the release of “25,” but the “Easy on Me” video released on Oct. 14 is comfortingly recognizable in style. It is testament to the extraordinary distinctness of Adele’s influence not only within her music but also within the visual space, that if you were presented with the “Easy on Me” music video with no context or sound, you would still know who the artist is immediately.
The video begins in black and white, with several shots of the interior of an empty, old-looking house that appears to be all packed up. Adele appears at a window with a slight smile playing on her lips. There is a shot of her in the hallway, briefcase in hand, putting on big sunglasses, and looking back once before she leaves the house. Outside the wind is howling, whipping the trees and Adele’s beautifully blow dried hair. She is on the phone but loses signal. Sound familiar?
Much is the same in the “Hello” music video: the wind, the old house, the lack of signal. However, there are some crucial differences. Unlike in “Hello,” Adele is selling the house and driving off, not retreating inside of it. There are no flashbacks to a previous relationship and no cup of tea being made — how could you betray British people like that Adele!
Jokes aside, this video feels very much forward-facing and focused solely on Adele. Although other figures do appear in the music video, they appear only once and are not a key part of the story, unlike in “Hello” in which Adele recalls her ex. It makes sense considering the sentiment Adele expressed in her British Vogue interview: “I really want people to hear my side of the story this time.”
Adele flicks her iconic eyeliner-coated eyes to look directly at us in the rearview mirror and the song begins. As she cruises down the road, she passes by a smiling family sitting beside a caravan with the banner, “Happy Holidays,” strung across it. Adele smiles, but there is a bitter undercurrent of pain to the image given the recent breaking apart of Adele’s own family. A young smiling newlywed couple speeds past her as she sings the lyric “I was still a child / Didn’t get the chance to / Feel the world around me.” The pairing of image and lyric feels like a learned warning from Adele to slow down and enjoy the world alone first.
A sudden shift into colour as the second chorus begins signifies a transition to a redemptive, uplifting tone as Adele appears to transition from nostalgia to looking ahead and from the darkness of former relationships to the light of focusing on herself and slowing down. Hopefully it is also an exciting omen for the vibrancy of the rest of the album to come.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Many of the world’s most powerful people have passed through Harvard. You or I might join them one day. Harvard’s mission, after all, is to “educate the citizens and citizen-leaders for our society.” But the Harvard undergraduate community’s focus on personal ambition combined with our subsequent subservience to authority causes us to be the exact opposite of what the world needs.
During the Harvard graduate student union’s three-day strike last week, I was surprised by the number of students who were supportive. The Undergraduate Council unanimously passed a resolution to support the strike, and many individuals and student organizations signed a letter of support. When I spoke with friends or distributed flyers at Annenberg, nearly every response to the strike was positive.
Undergraduates rallied to help. They signed up for picket shifts; they walked out of class on Thursday to attend a rally at which they might have even outnumbered the graduate students; and they disrupted President Bacow’s speech to freshman families on Friday. If another strike is called, this support must continue.
While I don’t want to diminish these contributions by undergraduates, there was also a lot of shallow solidarity. Many people I talked with were casually in support of the strike but unwilling to skip sections despite the very, very low risk of any penalties for absence, or the fact that new material usually isn’t covered. Numerous students weren’t willing to picket during time that could have been spent doing homework.
This is one of the most unfortunate aspects of Harvard culture: our inability to stand strong for what we believe in at times when it is counter to our personal ambition. And we see the same in our country’s politicians. Like many of us, as a Harvard Law School student U.S. Senator Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) was “full of ideals,” but he turned with the political tide from fiercely critiquing Trump to spearheading the effort to overturn the election. How can we expect to better the world if we aren’t willing to sacrifice for it?
Don’t get me wrong, showing up to class excited each day because we just love to learn is wonderful. When I was reading a Crimson article last month about former Harvard professor Cornel West ’74, I smiled to hear that he brought philosophy books to read at parties. But he also volunteered for the Black Panther Party breakfast program, and he traveled 30 miles on weekends to participate in the Panthers’ prison program.
Our myopic personal ambition is probably what got us here. We focus on classes, spending hours each day to obtain impressive results. Many of us work to impress our professors or advisors because we either want an A, need yet another recommendation letter, or maybe because sucking up is just in our blood by now. The first question people ask when doing something new is always “is this allowed?”
And this is why I’m afraid that Harvard students may leave this place unprepared to shake things up and transform our world wherein violence, oppression, and inequality are a constant and systemic presence. For that, we would need to protest, defy authority, and risk our own personal ambitions for the greater good.
Although those who do should be commended, not every Harvard student needs to risk arrest for a cause, like the divest activists who stormed the Harvard-Yale game did in 2019 (42 misdemeanor summons were issued). The consequences for such actions weigh disproportionately on students who depend on outside financial awards or visas and could stand to lose them. People of color often face harsher retribution for the same actions, such as how Black students are arrested at disproportionate rates by the Harvard University Police Department.
Still, given our unique circumstances, each of us can find ways to advance the public good. By standing up for what we know is right, regardless of the objections by those in authority, we risk our personal ambitions. But we become the leaders the world needs us to be.
Some things, like activism, are more important than checking a problem set, standing out to professors, or re-editing an essay. After we helped to disrupt President Bacow’s speech, a friend texted me: “Fighting for something that matters with beautiful people is pleasant to the soul.” More than that, it’s the right thing to do.

Adorning a wall in my dorm room is a portrait of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, with the letters “tRUTH” displayed just beneath the signature lace collar of her judge’s robe. Cleverly, it highlights a virtue so paramount to our judicial process. Her entire life, she fought relentlessly for the truth, and we live in a better world because of the work she did.
RBG served as a Justice of the Supreme Court from 1993 to 2020. Throughout an extraordinary career prior to her appointment, she was a law professor, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Women’s Rights Project, and a preeminent voice of the fight towards gender equality. An icon in the most modest of terms. The book “My Own Words,” offers a collection of selected compositions from her career. I urge you to spend some time with her words.
Antonin Scalia served as a Justice of that same Court from 1986 to 2016. He was an intellectual force behind the principles of originalism, leading the way for a generation of legal thinkers in embracing these ideas and shaping American jurisprudence as we know it. By any account, a foremost jurist in our judicial history. In the book, “Scalia Speaks: Reflections on Law, Faith, and Life Well Lived,” readers can relive some of his most remarkable speeches. I urge you to spend some time with his words as well.
RBG and Scalia shared a beautiful and enduring friendship. In many matters of law they were diametrically opposed. They differed deeply on their interpretations of the Constitution. On the most challenging legal and ideological questions, the very kind the highest court in the land is so often tasked with resolving, the two disagreed often. Yet this friendship, forged years before either of their appointments to the Court, never wavered through the decades they served together, through the tribulations of their profession. In fact, you might be delighted to learn, as I was, that an opera was written about the two of them, spotlighting their contrasting views and their unlikely friendship: “Scalia/Ginsburg,” composed by librettist Derrick Wang, is truly a gem.
Both of them treasured the power of writing well and communicating clearly. RBG said of Vladimir Nabokov, her professor of European Literature as an undergrad at Cornell: “he changed the way I read and the way I write.” From him, she learned that “choosing the right word, and the right word order … could make an enormous difference.” For Scalia, who was a devoted law school teacher for much of his life, good writing emerged at the expense of a great deal of “time and sweat,” as he would tell his students. As Justices, the two of them often exchanged drafts of their opinions for review because, in light of their stark differences, they had the utmost respect for each other’s wisdom and good faith.
Important in anything we may endeavor towards, RBG and Scalia have shown us, time and time again, the immense strength we have in our voice, and through our words. As I write this column, I labor to find the right words, in the right order, because I want to communicate my message as precisely and convincingly as I can, as RBG would have hoped. This always requires a great deal of time and sweat, as Scalia knew. Through this process, perhaps I can, ever so gradually, find my voice — find what words are my own.
I believe an important mission of our college experience is to discover and craft our voice. It’s what we will use to fight for change when change is overdue. It’s what we will use to empower ourselves and empower others. As we eagerly chase after our academic passions, immersing ourselves in the voices of others, we’re constantly discovering our own.
The portrait in my dorm room isn’t the only place I see the word “truth” around me. The word Veritas is in every corner of our campus. Like judges, we are called upon every day to seek truth. Our education embarks us on a journey towards this virtue, and this journey lasts us a lifetime. We may even find, along the way, the Scalia to our Ginsburg, or the Ginsburg to our Scalia.
Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Antonin Scalia, in all their differences, shared a respect and appreciation for the institution and the people they so purposefully and dutifully served. They believed, unequivocally, in the power of their ideas, their voice, and their words. In that judgment, I concur without reservation.

Since the first race for Boston mayor was held in 1822, the city's mayoral victors have, amidst their individual, personal, and political differences, unfailingly shared two things in common: They have all been white and male. Today, though, that’s all about to change: After a preliminary runoff with an already diverse slate of candidates, the two left standing for today’s election are Annissa Essaibi George and Michelle Wu ’07, two women of color.
It’s taken us a long time to reach this landmark. While Acting Mayor Kim Janey made headlines in March 2021 by becoming the first person of color and the first woman to serve as the mayor of Boston, Janey assumed the position without an election after former mayor Marty Walsh was chosen to be President Joe Biden’s Secretary of Labor. Today, however, promises to be the first time ever that the voters of Boston will elect a woman of color.
It is quite jarring that Boston, in its entire 200-year history, has exclusively elected white men to hold the position of mayor. Boston is a majority-minority city, with a burgeoning immigrant population and a waning percentage of white constituents. As progressive as it might seem, Boston still has an incredibly long way to go in terms of electing politicians who represent its constituents.
Today’s election, then, marks an important first step towards achieving long-overdue strokes of victory for underrepresented groups. But to be clear, our enthusiasm is about much more than a simple game of identity politics: Gender is not in and of itself a qualifying factor. George and Wu began serving on the Boston City Council in 2015 and 2013, respectively, and Wu became the council president in 2016. Through their time in office, both women have demonstrated that they care about the City of Boston, and that they have the experience necessary to succeed in this role.
We’d also like to point out that, as an alumna of Harvard College, we believe that the trajectory of Michelle Wu’s involvement in the City of Boston is a model for College students seeking involvement in local politics. From earning a legal fellowship at Boston City Hall to running for Boston City Council, Wu has shown incredible investment in the city. Any Harvard undergraduate looking to get involved in local politics should seek to follow her lead of steady dedication, establishing trust within the communities they seek to serve.
At a broader level, we’re excited for what this election will mean when it comes to increasing representation of historically marginalized groups in both Boston and our democracy at large. Historically, women of color have been underrepresented on the gubernatorial and national levels. It is our hope that an increase in representation of women of color on the local level, especially in a city like Boston that is seen as symbolic of the founding of American democracy, will send rippling effects throughout our democracy at large.
To that end, we are eager-eyed and curious to see which contender will cross through the finish line in today’s long-awaited race. Perhaps it will be Wu, as polls have suggested thus far; or maybe Annissa Essaibi George will charge forward and take the city by surprise.
Either way, when she wins, Boston’s new mayor will represent a turn away from the city’s homogeneous past and will help move us towards a future that is powered by leaders who are not only experienced, but are poised to listen and respond to the increasingly diverse tapestry of people whom they represent.

UPDATED: November 2, 2021 at 8:15 p.m.
The Undergraduate Council passed legislation to release a statement against Harvard’s decision to hold a course preview period instead of the traditional shopping week and to establish an advocacy fund in its Sunday meeting.
The first piece of legislation called for a statement to be released against the course preview period that Harvard announced in a recent email. The UC said it would send a statement to University President Lawrence S. Bacow, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda Claybaugh, and all 50 undergraduate concentration department chairs.
The statement criticizes Harvard’s decision to cancel shopping week — the tradition whereby students can browse courses in person before registering — for the fourth semester in a row and replace it with a virtual course preview period that will extend from Jan. 14 to Jan. 20 and conflict with Martin Luther King Jr. weekend. Harvard Registrar Mike Burke announced in an Oct. 13 email to undergraduates that the Faculty of Arts and Sciences will hold an early registration schedule for the spring semester in lieu of shopping week. In the email, Burke cited the coronavirus and Harvard's efforts to protect the health of affiliates, especially as students and faculty travel back to campus after winter break.
“Placing Course Preview Period over Martin Luther King Jr. Weekend is part of Harvard’s broader pattern of failing to live up to its stated commitment to racial justice,” the statement reads.
The statement also addresses Harvard's failure to meet student demands despite an overwhelming majority of undergraduates voting in favor of restoring shopping week.
“Harvard’s actions suggest that they would rather ignore the overwhelming 96.5 percent of students who voted for safely restoring Shopping Week in a September referendum, than consult students on course registration in an open, public, and meaningful process,” the statement reads.
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an email that the College will not have any events on Martin Luther King Day and maintained that undergraduates did provide input on the course preview period.
“With respect to concerns related to the spring semester’s registration process, the College went through the [Standing Committee on Undergraduate Educational Policy], which represents student voices and is not a ‘hidden committee,’” Dane wrote.
The statement questions Harvard’s decision to cancel shopping week in order to maintain Covid-19 guidelines, as Harvard has “yet to identify a case of Covid-19 transmission in a classroom.” It goes on to propose alternative solutions to contact tracing to keep Harvard affiliates safe during an in-person shopping period.
In addition, the statement calls on Harvard to cancel the course preview period to instead hold public forums for students to express their opinions and provide a timeline for restoring shopping week.
The legislation was sponsored by 13 UC representatives and passed by a vote of 44-0-0.
The second act — one of the first put up by the new Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Committee — establishes a fund for student advocacy efforts across campus.
“Supporting students in their ability to protest, demonstrate, and advocate for causes they believe falls under the purview of the Undergraduate Council,” the legislation reads.
The act sets aside a total of $3,000 to be given to individual students or student groups in grants of up to $300. These grants will aid advocacy efforts by subsidizing the cost of physical items, travel, food, and project initiation, the act reads.
In the case that student requests exceed what the UC can provide, their funding will be given selectively based on the “compelling interests” of financial need, the necessity of items, and student involvement.
The legislation does not specify what standards will dictate the decision-making process. Applications must be approved by the DEI Committee, as well as the majority of the entire UC.
The sponsors of the bill were UC President Noah A. Harris ’22, Vice President Jenny Y. Gan ’22, Treasurer Kimani E. Panthier ’24, Adams House Representative Tarina K. Ahuja ’24, and Maple Yard Representative Laila A. Nasher ’25.
CORRECTION: November 2, 2021
A previous version of this article stated that advocacy fund grants would be capped at $300. In fact, an amendment was passed to lift that cap. Additionally, the applications must be approved by a majority of the entire UC, in addition to the DEI Committee.

UPDATED: November 2, 2021 at 10:30 a.m.
Former Harvard Chemistry chair Charles M. Lieber will head to trial this December to fight six felony charges brought against him by federal prosecutors.
Federal authorities arrested Lieber in January 2020 on charges that he made false statements to officials investigating his funding sources. According to the government, Lieber lied to the Defense Department and the National Institutes of Health about alleged ties to China’s Thousand Talents Plan, a talent recruitment program.
In June 2020, a federal grand jury indicted Lieber on two counts of making false statements. Later that summer, he was additionally indicted on four related tax offenses for allegedly failing to report income he received from Wuhan University of Technology.
Last month, Lieber filed a motion to suppress statements he made during a January 2020 interrogation at Harvard University Police Department headquarters following his arrest. Lieber alleged that federal agents “ignored the invocation of his right to an attorney by proceeding with the questioning after he requested an attorney.”
U.S. District Judge Rya W. Zobel, however, sided with the government, ruling that Lieber saying “I guess I think probably I should have ah, an attorney” was not “sufficiently unambiguous to constitute an invocation of his right to counsel.”
Lieber has maintained his innocence throughout the proceedings. He has received backing from several prominent academics, as well. In March, 41 professors at American universities — including seven Nobel laureates — penned a letter arguing against the federal government’s prosecution of Lieber.
Alongside the charges against him, Lieber has also been battling an advanced form of lymphoma, and his attorneys have pushed for an expedient trial for the opportunity to clear his name. In an Oct. 12 update to the court, Torrey K. Young, one of Lieber’s attorneys, wrote that “Professor Lieber’s health continues to be a paramount concern.”
“There are two possible treatments that Professor Lieber can consider once the current treatment fails to adequately slow cancer progression or the side effects become too severe, which he fears will be sooner rather than later,” Young wrote. “Both treatments require extensive hospitalization (i.e., about a month) with isolation given infection risks. Both treatments also have higher treatment associated morbidity (death) than anything he has already tried."
The final pretrial conference in the case is scheduled for Dec. 8, with a jury trial beginning Dec. 14.
A federal charge for making false statements allows for a sentence of up to five years in prison, three years of supervised release, and a $250,000 fine.
Separate from his criminal trial, Lieber continues to pursue a civil suit against Harvard, alleging the University broke its contract by refusing to reimburse his criminal defense fees.
University officials have previously argued that Lieber’s conduct — which they say led Harvard to submit false statements to the government — falls within exclusions in the indemnification policy.
Harvard placed Lieber on paid administrative leave the day of his arrest. In an interview last month, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay declined to comment on an ongoing University review of Lieber.
Spokespeople for the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts and Harvard declined to comment Monday.
CORRECTION: November 2, 2021
A previous version of this article misstated the nature of Lieber's illness. In fact, he has an advanced form of lymphoma.

Wall Street Journal reporter Jeff Horwitz, who led an investigation into Facebook that uncovered thousands of internal company documents, detailed how the social media giant operates internally and discussed its future at a Harvard Institute of Politics event Monday evening.
The event — entitled “The Facebook Files: Are teens and democratic societies at risk?” — came less than two months after the Wall Street Journal published an investigation detailing how Facebook was aware of harms perpetuated by its services. The discussion was moderated by Harvard Kennedy School professor Latanya A. Sweeney, who founded the Data Privacy Lab at Harvard’s Institute for Quantitative Social Science.
“Facebook is deeply partisan in favor of Facebook,” Horwitz said Monday. “They built a thing — it was tremendously successful. They, in very typical Silicon Valley fashion, did not really think that much about externalities because, you know, why would they? And then basically realized very late in the game that their product had some significant deleterious effects around the world.”
Horwitz discussed how he first gained access to Facebook’s internal files by developing a relationship with a company whistleblower, Frances Haugen. He said Haugen “got in touch” after the restructuring of Facebook’s civic integrity teams, which examined the social media giant’s role in elections around the world, following the 2020 election.
Horwitz said some of the documents obtained in the investigation were “really surprising” to him.
“The trade-offs didn’t seem that painful,” he said. “There were ways to cut misinformation or hate speech or [violence and incitement] significantly, at a cost of a fraction of a percent of usage.”
Facebook announced last week that it would change its corporate name to Meta Platforms, rebranding the parent company that operates WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook.
Horowitz said that Meta CEO Mark E. Zuckerberg, who dropped out of Harvard College in 2004 to develop Facebook, plays a hands-on role in making major decisions at the company.
“The centrality is absolutely there,” Horowitz said.
Horwitz said he was disheartened by some Facebook employees’ refusal to believe the findings of his reporting.
“I think there is some willful blindness,” he said.
In an interview before the event, Horwitz said it was important to discuss his reporting with students who may go on to work in the tech industry. He added that he would not discourage young people from working in the sector.
“By all means, go to work for them,” he said. “There’s fascinating work being done. It’s groundbreaking stuff in there.”
In a statement, Meta spokesperson Andy Stone wrote that the company has “every commercial and moral incentive” to “try to give the maximum number of people as much of a positive experience as possible on Facebook.”
“The growth of people or advertisers using Facebook means nothing if our services aren’t being used in ways that bring people closer together,” he wrote. “That’s why we take steps to keep people safe even if it impacts our bottom line. To say we turn a blind eye to feedback ignores these investments, which includes the over $5 billion we’re on track to spend this year alone on safety and security, as well as the 40,000 people working on these issues at Facebook.”

Researchers from Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences developed a shape-shifting material that can morph into and hold any 3D shape, opening the door to a potentially infinite number of applications.
Featured in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in October, the researchers developed small morphable units, which they called unit cells, that can be attached to each other to create “totimorphic” structures, which have the ability to stably take on any shape.
According to Harvard postdoctoral researcher and co-first author of the paper S. Ganga Prasath, the traditional approach to constructing shape-transforming structures is to have a material that can shift into a predetermined target shape once an external force or stimulus is applied.
“This approach was successful, but it could only create materials that could go between two shapes,” Prasath said. “What we came up with was to extend this notion of shape-transforming materials, but to arbitrary shapes.”
Prasath said that the new idea was inspired by the concept of “neutral stability,” which describes the state of a structure that is equally stable in all of its possible 3D conformations.
Postdoctoral fellow and co-first author Gaurav Chaudhary said the group only found one example in previous literature of a structure displaying neutral stability, known as the Anglepoise lamp.
Chaudhary said the Anglepoise lamp — used as the mascot of Pixar Animation Studios — can take on any spatial position and remain there stably. The researchers aimed to replicate this in a more general structure.
“What we have done is taken that simple idea and try to see if we can generalize this, to basically now make any material which is not just a lamp,” Chaudhary said.
The “neutrally stable unit cell” created by the researchers deforms from its current shape by transferring energy between two elastic springs but still displays a “rigid-plastic” stability at every position. These unit cells can be attached to each other like building blocks, per the group’s paper.
The result is the ability to construct “infinitely morphable structures” while allowing for “independent control of their geometry and mechanical properties,” according to Harvard professor and senior author Lakshminarayanan Mahadevan.
Mahadevan wrote in an email that the discovery offers new practical possibilities in material design.
“I think it will provide a new alphabet for engineers, designers and architects since totimorphic assemblies allow for much more exquisite control of shape at multiple scales,” Mahadevan wrote.
Prasath said the totimorphic material has potential biomedical applications, such as the construction of stents — mesh tubes that hold open passageways such as arteries and veins that have narrowed.
“That is one place that you could use this, but we haven’t started working at that scale at all,” he said.
Chaudhary noted the development holds implications for “soft robotics,” in which engineers seek to replace hard robot parts with soft, elastic materials that can deform in “very certain, very specific ways.”
Per Mahadevan, the next research steps are to explore the possibility of “different types or classes” of these unit cells and to devise simpler ways to manufacture the materials.

In the opening salvo of their effort to appeal the March dismissal of Lanier v. Harvard, lawyers for Tamara K. Lanier and Harvard argued before the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Monday about whether the University unlawfully possesses and profits from historic photos Lanier says depict her enslaved ancestors.
The hour-and-15-minute long hearing before the state’s Supreme Court comes eight months after a Middlesex Superior Court judge dismissed the suit on the grounds that the statute of limitations had passed and that Lanier did not have property rights to the daguerreotypes.
Lanier’s suit, filed against the University in March 2019, centers on the daguerreotypes of two enslaved people named Renty and Delia, which scholars believe to be some of the oldest images of enslaved people. According to Lanier, they depict her great-great-great-grandfather Renty and his daughter Delia.
Harvard biologist Louis Agassiz commissioned the photos in the 19th century as part of a pseudo-scientific study to prove the superiority of white people. Lanier requested in the suit that Harvard turn the daguerreotypes over to her, relinquish any profit made through the images, and pay her punitive damages.
On Monday, Lanier’s legal team sought to convince the justices that, just as Massachusetts had abolished slavery in 1783, the Court had the ability to change history and order repatriation rights to the descendants of enslaved people.
“The fact that I stand before you as a free man and not a slave is a testament to someone's decision to change the course of human history,” Attorney Benjamin L. Crump, one of Lanier’s lawyers, said in his opening argument.
“It is a testament to our legal system,” he added.
Crump and his co-counsel, attorney Joshua D. Koskoff, argued Lanier is entitled to the daguerreotypes because her pictured ancestors, Renty and Delia, had a property or “possessory” right to the photographs.
Amid the justices’ dissection of their legal argument, Koskoff pushed back on the definition of “property,” claiming that moving past the idea of property as something bought or sold was essential to understanding the crux of the case. Property, Koskoff argued, is anything that is exchanged for value.
“First of all, when we typically get our photographs taken, they’re taken of us, not from us,” Koskoff said. “Photographers don’t typically, hopefully, abuse us to get photographs.”
He also argued that Renty and Delia were falsely imprisoned and deprived of their rights to privacy given the coercive nature of the photographs.
“But if ever there was a taking of value, it was the taking of Renty and Delia in these abusive and torturous circumstances,” he said.
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an email that the University was “grateful” to Lanier for “sparking important conversations” about the daguerreotypes and the “horrific circumstances” under which they were created.
“We have long been willing to place these images with another museum or other public institution to put them in the appropriate context and increase their access for communities of color and all Americans,” Dane wrote. “The active litigation has prevented us from moving forward with this goal.”
During the hearing, Harvard’s lawyer Anton Melitsky argued that Lanier was not entitled to the photographs because photographers own the pictures they take. Melitsky also said the statute of limitations on the case had passed, given that Lanier first contacted former University President Drew G. Faust regarding the photos in 2011.
Melitsky also said that for this case, Harvard would not dispute whether Lanier is a lineal descendant of the enslaved subjects.
Following the hearing, Lanier said during a press conference that besides the legal argument, the most important part of the hearing had been the “promises unbroken.”
“What I was thinking about were the promises unbroken, the promises that I made to my mother, the promises that she made to her ancestors to tell the true story — to tell the legacy of her enslaved ancestor, Papa Renty,” she said.
Crump said the state Supreme Court was the appropriate place to litigate the arguments raised in Lanier’s suit — and fitting that it would happen at the John Adams Courthouse, where slavery in Massachusetts was abolished in 1783. He added that this case was “170 years in the making.”
“This was a case not just for Miss Lanier, but it really was for the ancestors who for generations have said, ‘We have a right to tell our own narrative, a right to tell our own story, not for Harvard University to tell the right of enslaved Africans after they perpetuated slavery in America,'” Crump said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard grabbed its first Ivy League win of the season by a score of 1-0 in a wet and physical matchup on a rainy Saturday afternoon at Jordan Field.
After scoring in the first minute of the match, Harvard (6-5-3, 1-2-2 Ivy) was not able to break down Dartmouth (2-10-1, 0-4-1 Ivy) a second time in the remaining 89 minutes but stayed composed on defense to earn the victory.
“I was thrilled with our character and battle in it, and I think that's something that hasn't always been there for us,” said coach Josh Shapiro of the win. “I’m really proud of how they fought through it.”
The game got off to an exciting start as the Crimson found the back of the net in under 60 seconds. The move started when senior midfielder Cornelius Bencsik forced a turnover in Dartmouth’s defensive third and dished the ball to junior forward Martin Vician.
Vician found sophomore midfielder Willem Ebbinge out wide, who beat his man to find a yard of space and crossed back in to Vician, who poked the ball past the keeper with his first touch for his fifth goal of the season, and his fourth in six games. The assist was Ebbinge’s team-best ninth of the season.
After scoring, Harvard looked as if it might score every time it went forward in the first fifteen minutes of the match. Bencsik was found in space in front of goal by first-year forward Alessandro Arlotti with a smart through ball in the 10th minute, but he shot wide. Just over a minute later, Arlotti got on the end of a cross from senior defender Havard Hjermstad, but his effort hit the post. Bencsik and Arlotti combined again in the fifteenth minute, but Arlotti was called offside as he ran through on goal.
The game was a physical one, with lots of late challenges on both sides, but the referee elected to keep the cards in his pocket until the last 10 minutes of the game, with the Big Green receiving three yellow cards in the final minutes of the match. The most egregious of these incidents came when defender and captain Fernando Docters was knocked down and then kicked on the ground, with Dartmouth’s senior defender Jordan Bailon lucky to not see red for the incident.
As the game progressed, the rain got worse, making it harder for either side to create clear-cut chances. Despite these worsening conditions, first-year defender Jan Riecke nearly scored his first goal for the Crimson, heading a corner just wide in the 50th minute.
The Big Green settled into the game later on, nearly equalizing on a few occasions in the second half. In the 59th minute, junior goalkeeper Oskar Nilsson found himself in a one-on-one situation with the Dartmouth striker but was able to cut the angle down and force the shot onto the post and out to safety. Then in the 63rd minute, Nilsson came up big again, saving a shot from the edge of the box at full stretch to deny the Big Green the equalizer.
“We knew with the conditions and everything that it wasn't gonna be pretty,” Nilsson said of the match. “But I mean, we fought, and we saw it out, and that’s what matters.”
Nilsson capped off a strong performance with a great save in the closing seconds of the game. When the Crimson failed to clear a ball in the box with twenty seconds to play, it fell to Dartmouth’s striker near the penalty spot. He leveled a low shot in traffic, which Nilsson managed to get down to and push wide, ending the game and securing Harvard’s first Ivy League victory of the season.
“It felt great — it's what I love to do,” Nilsson said of the save. “Obviously, we don't want to concede a chance like that at the end of the game. But it felt great.”
The Crimson now heads down to New York to face Columbia in its final road match of the season, with kickoff set for 8 p.m. on Saturday.
