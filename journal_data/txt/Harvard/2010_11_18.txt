After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The hundreds of undergraduates who bought vuvuzelas for Harvard-Yale will have to use them in their rooms, dining halls, or classes, because they will no longer be allowed inside Harvard Stadium during the 127th edition of The Game this Saturday. Although we appreciate the school spirit behind the students’ decisions to buy and distribute vuvuzelas, the sound made by these instruments, which rose to popularity during the 2010 Fédération Internationale de Football Association World Cup in South Africa this summer, has been compared to “a herd of blaring elephants” or “a hive of angry bees.” Therefore, the ban is appropriate, given the number of people who attend The Game as a social experience and how detrimental vuvuzelas would be to that experience.
The rivalry between Harvard and Yale rests on an all-in-good fun attitude, and is not about actually damaging fans of either side. There have been many instances of this rivalry being exercised in an enjoyable and not harmful way. In 2004, Yale students handed out fliers to Harvard students that collectively read “We Suck.” (Obviously, we don’t.) Harvard student groups print t-shirts with derogatory sayings about Yale every year; this year’s Harvard College Fund Undergraduate Committee t-shirt says, “Google ‘safety school’…’ Did you mean Yale?’” These playful jokes bolster school spirit on both sides, and enhance the positive social experience that Harvard-Yale provides.
However, vuvuzelas are different from other spirit-raising techniques because they can cause actual physical harm. The vuvuzela, traditionally made from a kudu horn, was originally used to summon distant people for meetings; it was not intended to be heard continuously at close range. In an article published in the South African Medical Journal, two audiologists from the University of Florida and the University of Pretoria tested the hearing of 11 World Cup spectators before and after matches, and they found that the average sound exposure was 100.5 decibels. To put this in context, British occupational standards dictate that workers exposed to greater than 85 decibels be given special hearing protections. As noted by The Hearing Journal, a vuvuzela is louder than either a lawnmower or a chainsaw, and exposure to sounds of greater than 100 decibels for more than 15 minutes could cause permanent hearing damage. Because “The Game” will most definitely last much longer than 15 minutes, this danger is real.
Additionally, vuvuzelas disrupt more than the fan experience; the band and athletes deserve not to be interrupted, as well. Harvard-Yale provides the band with its premier opportunity to showcase its talents for the entire student body. Their funny, creative halftime show deserves to be audible to the entire audience, and so do the lively takes on popular songs that they play during breaks. Also of import, vuvuzelas could disrupt the football players on the field (including Harvard athletes), and mitigating their success seems counterproductive to the intention of the vuvuzela campaign. Also, if either Harvard or Yale brought more vuvuzelas, their side would have an advantage in the match. We don’t need such an advantage because Harvard will undoubtedly win anyway, and we would feel bad if our victory was attributed to our ability to organize a South African horn-buying campaign rather than our superior athletic prowess.
We understand that some fans were greatly looking forward to trumpeting their vuvuzelas at The Game, and that they see the ban as detrimental to their experience. While we understand the importance of this concern, Harvard-Yale has been an enjoyable experience for 126 years, without vuvuzelas, so we doubt their absence will demonstrably change the social nature of the event.
It’s unfortunate that the athletic department announced its decision so late, after many people had already bought vuvuzelas. As recently as last week, Associate Director of Athletics Timothy W. Wheaton had expressed that the horns would be allowed in the stadium, because they do not violate National Collegiate Athletic Association regulations. We hope that in future years, the Department of Athletics notifies us of game-day rules well in advance, so that we can focus all of our energies on doing what we do best: beating Yale.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We all remember those life skills we learned in kindergarten: reading, finger-painting, and, of course, hand washing. Basic hygiene is a part of every American elementary school curriculum, and in the United States, things like soap, clean drinking water, and access to toilets are taken for granted. However, in other parts of the world, such simple resources could save lives.
There is a stark disparity in access to proper sanitation facilities between developed and developing countries. Sanitation coverage (sufficient access to public toilets, clean drinking water, functional sewage) is available to 98 percent of people in developed nations and only 49 percent of people in developing nations. The World Health Organization revealed in its 2010 annual assessment that 2.6 billion people, about one third of the world’s population, do not have access to even a simple toilet. The lack of these basic resources is a fundamental problem that we should all be more worried about.
A vital part of sanitations efforts is the provision of clean water. Consider that Americans use on average 138 gallons of water daily while most of the people who live in slums only have access to eight gallons of water for all of their daily uses. This is barely enough to fulfill their needs. In fact, a five-minute shower uses more water than most people use in one day.
And the issue is not just the lack of water, but also the lack of water in a condition appropriate for drinking, cooking, and bathing. The WHO’s 2010 asessment cites that 900 million people are not drinking water from improved—safe, clean—sources. The United Nations highlights that this lack of improved water stems from poverty, political relations, power struggles and other inequalities; in many cases, providing clean water is significantly more difficult and complex than providing any water.
These issues merit urgent attention because areas without clean water and proper sanitation facilities (like toilets) are breeding grounds for disease. Water quickly becomes contaminated and begins to endanger the lives of citizens by increasing levels of diarrhea and subsequent malnutrition. It can even lead to epidemics of life-threatening diseases; the most recent cholera outbreak in Haiti, caused by heavy rains from Hurricane Tomas and a lack of sewage, has claimed the lives of over 900 people.
There have been some efforts to address these problems, but they are not enough. Through the efforts of multiple organizations, about 90 percent of the world population is expected to have access to cleaner water by 2015. However, the world population is expected to increase by three billion people by 2050, and 90 percent of these three billion, will be born to families in developing countries. While there is hope for improved water, the exponential population increase poses an additional challenge.
A recent study determined that 2.4 million lives could be saved yearly if everyone had access to sanitation facilities, clean water and practiced basic hygiene. As it turns out, the lack of sanitation is the prominent cause of infection in the world. Essentially, basic kindergarten knowledge, and the resources to execute it, has the potential to save lives.

There are approximately 30,000 Muslims in the State of Oklahoma. And apparently, the State of Oklahoma thinks they’re up to something.
Oklahoma voters recently ratified a state constitutional amendment that prohibits judges from considering Sharia law in their decisions. The proposal was bolstered by a case in New Jersey in which the court considered Sharia law in its decision to deny a Muslim woman a restraining order against her sexually abusive ex-husband. That decision, thankfully, was overturned on appeal. But it was enough to drive seven out of ten Oklahoma voters toward the “Save Our State” Amendment,” to “save” Oklahoma from, in the words of the bill’s main author, Muslims who desire nothing more than to take away “liberties and freedom from our children.”
The Oklahoma chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations is currently challenging the constitutionality of this amendment, and rightfully so. But the law exemplifies something far more insidious than bad public policy. Quite simply, there is a dangerous amount of ignorance in the United States about what Sharia law actually is. And until this misconception is corrected, as another concerned columnist so eloquently put it, the war on global Islamist terror will also continue be a war on American Muslims.
Particularly during the Park51 controversy this summer, a wave of hysteria swept the country over the prospect of Sharia law on American soil. Following reports that the imam behind the Islamic center considered the United States a “Sharia-compliant” country, right-wing commentators labeled the man a “radical” and bashed his ostensible support for “bringing Sharia law to America.” Park51 protestors ferociously waved signs featuring the word “Sharia” in dripping blood-red paint. And during her campaign, Sharron Angle infamously referred to the possibility of Sharia law in the United States as a “militant terrorist situation.”
Their scorn for Sharia, of course, does not emerge from a vacuum. Practitioners of Sharia in countries like Iran and Afghanistan, the headlines tell us, stone adulterous women, cut off thieves’ hands, and physically mutilate wives for running away from their husbands. In addition, many on the right look to Britain, where the government officially sanctions Sharia courts. The main author of the Oklahoma bill referred to the British courts as a “cancer” and considers his amendment a “pre-emptive strike” against an ideology that seeks to subvert the “Judeo-Christian principles” upon which America was founded.
Unfortunately for him, however, Sharia has already made it to our shores.
Sharia—meaning “the path”—is far from merely a penal system and is far from monolithic. Every single behavior in a devout Muslim’s life is regulated by the jurisprudence of the Koran and the Sunna, the Prophetic tradition. There at least five major schools of jurisprudence and myriad philosophies within each school. So although the word “Sharia” may conjure images of floggings and female circumcision, for the vast majority of American Muslims, life under Sharia is about as oppressive raising a family, doing community service, and abstaining from alcohol.
Furthermore, the framework for sanctioning Islamic tribunals in the United States has existed for years. As one legal blogger notes, Sharia courts—such as those in England—fall under the category of “alternative dispute resolution” mechanisms. If two parties in a dispute agree to abide by the decisions of a third party, the government must enforce that third party’s decision so long as it does not violate public policy or the law. In the United States, resolutions like this can take secular form in arbitration, religious form in Orthodox Jewish Beit Dins, and entertaining form in popular shows like “Judge Judy.” There is nothing frightening about this, and certainly nothing “militant.”
So what of the apparent fear that, if given a toehold in America, Sharia courts will establish a “parallel legal system” that enshrines honor killings and spousal abuse? Twenty years ago, in Employment Division v. Smith, the Supreme Court precluded this fear by ruling that absent a compelling state interest, religious law cannot override secular law. As Antonin G. Scalia wrote for the majority opinion, it would contradict “both constitutional tradition and common sense” to “make an individual’s obligation to obey” the law “contingent upon the law’s coincidence with his religious beliefs.”
To be sure, there is still a compelling question as to how voluntary these courts are in some cases. Often in Britain, writes one editorialist for The Guardian, Muslim women face tremendous community pressure to accept decisions that are clearly biased against them. But the United States can deal with issues of duress individually. It should not impact the rights of Muslims who genuinely desire to resolve their financial and civil disputes among themselves.
During his recent visit to Indonesia, President Barack H. Obama reiterated that America is not at war with Islam. But we must go even further: America is not at war with Sharia, either. Sharia is the Islamic legal code, a code that Muslims have every right to arbitrate under as long as their decisions do not violate American law or public policy. It’s that simple. And frankly, it is absurd to think that fear should prevent the United States from awarding Muslims the same rights it awards to Orthodox Jews and contestants on “Judge Judy.”

To the editors:
As a frequent visitor to Haiti I am familiar with the inspiring work of Fondation Connaissance et Liberte and Partners in Health, the two organizations Meredith C. Baker highlights in her Oct. 28 column, “Helping Haiti Help Itself.” Like all members of the Harvard community who reap the benefits of a great university, I’m also reminded daily of the essential role that education plays in the development of individuals, communities, and countries.  There is a direct correlation between education levels, life expectancy, and income levels. In the midst of the many failures of international aid that Baker alludes to, education may be one of the only foolproof methods of development. Sadly, 84 percent of Haitians with a university degree live outside Haiti, and the university enrollment rate, at less than one percent, is among the lowest in the world.  Educating Haitian youth is crucial to the future of this island nation, and alas, higher education is often inaccessible to even the best Haitian students.
In this light I would like to note the work of The Haitian Education and Leadership Program, which provides merit and need-based university scholarships within Haiti.  Educating a new generation of Haitian leaders is essential to breaking Haiti’s centuries-old tradition of exclusion and exploitation. HELP is an exemplary case of an NGO working toward the type of long-term lasting development that Baker acknowledges is lacking in many aid programs. I think they are worthy of our attention.  I thank The Crimson and Meredith Baker for a valuable article on an important topic, and encourage the Harvard community to continue to contribute its significant human and material capital to the future of post-earthquake Haiti.

To the editors:
I’m writing in response to Sandra Y. L. Korn’s Nov. 15 op-ed, “Handbags, Bras, and Breast Cancer.”
First of all, calling breast cancer awareness campaigns “gender-normative” and criticizing the empowerment aspects of these campaigns further marginalizes breast cancer survivors who feel less feminine as a result of cancer treatment, whether from baldness after chemotherapy or the surgical removal of one or both breasts.  I assume that the less than one percent of breast cancer victims who are men do not feel their identity fundamentally threatened in the way a woman who has lived her entire adult life with two breasts does.
My second issue with the article is that it is fundamentally offensive to me as a Harvard woman.  Korn, also a Harvard woman, writes that breast cancer awareness campaigns like “Save Second Base” shirts fail “to support breast cancer victims and instead subtly [hint] at the sexual availability of Harvard’s women.”  Excuse me?  When you read between the lines of a “Save Second Base” shirt, do you see “Save Second Base because I’m a slut and would really appreciate keeping these boobs around for awhile so more guys will have sex with me throughout my life”?  Because when I look at the shirt, I think, “Wow, that’s a really clever way to get young people motivated, involved, and willing to give money to support breast cancer research.”  The pink bras and “Save Second Base” initiatives aren’t about sexualizing breast cancer—they’re about identifying with women of all ages in a way they find light-hearted and funny.
So which university organization is objectifying women as nothing more than sexual objects by publishing such absurdly baseless statements?  And which group is trying to empower women affected by a deadly, potentially humiliating, identity-changing disease and attempting to expand their community of support with good-natured humor?  Every breast cancer survivor that I’ve encountered hails these campaigns as successful strategies for raising money and advocating preventative measures, while also empowering sufferers.

Though it may be hard to believe, it’s already been nine years since Potter-heads around the world were introduced to the silver-screen personalities of Harry, Ron, and Hermione in the movie “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone.” Maybe it seems kind of creepy that we’ve been watching them grow up right before our eyes (oh hey, Emma Watson), but we’ve been growing up right alongside them, and now it’s time to celebrate the bittersweet—but still triumphant —beginning-of-the-end. FM thought of no better way to celebrate than to grab our friends and a mug of our favorite wizarding libation (toss-up butterbeer or firewhiskey) and get in touch with our inner spell-caster as we watched “The Deathly Hallows: Part 1.” 
—Whenever somebody casts a spell, take a sip (take a gulp if Hermione casts it).
—If you hear the full name “Harry Potter,” take a sip (two if the person saying “Harry Potter” sounds particularly surprised or confounded).
—If somebody casts “Avada Kedavra,” kill your drink. 
—Whenever people draw their wands, take a drink (if more than four people at a time draw their wands, finish your drink).
—Whenever Harry says something inspirational or reassuring, take a sip.
—Take a drink whenever Ron has a scared, disgusted, or perplexed look on his face.
—Whenever Snape speaks with a nasal, overly dramatic affectation, pinch your nose and take a drink, condescendingly.
—Whenever people start flying, either by broomstick or by means of magical creatures, stop drinking because it’s so freaking cool. 
—Whenever anybody says “horcrux,” last person to touch their Dark Mark finishes their drink.
—If you hear somebody say “He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named,” or any of its variants, dissolve your soul into seven pieces and take a drink for each. 
—Whenever you see the spires of Hogwarts, the smoke stack of the Hogwarts Express, or Harry, Ron and Hermione uniting against the forces of evil, drink to nostalgia and feeling like a kid again.

David R. Sedaris, author of such popular collections of stories as “Holidays On Ice,” “Me Talk Pretty One Day,” and his new compilation, “Squirrel Seeks Chipmunk: A Modest Bestiary,” isn’t one to show off his literary success. Sedaris pays no heed to the critical reception of his work, and (sadly) doesn’t even read his own interviews. Punctuating his sentences with “gosh” and “golly,” the humorist chatted with FM about surviving the holiday season, meeting writer Amy Hempel, and his impression of Harvard.
1. Fifteen Minutes: What inspired you to write “Squirrel Seeks Chipmunk”?
David R. Sedaris: Audio collections of really, really bad South African folktales. I just started reading them and thought, “I can do better than this.”
2. FM: How have you felt about its critical reception thus far?
DRS: Oh my goodness. I don’t ever read any reviews—I have no idea what its critical reception is. My publicist told me she would tell me if there was something really horrible so I would know about it. And she hasn’t told me anything so far. Although she told me, “There was nothing terrible, but there was a review in The Harvard Crimson that I didn’t understand at all.”
3. FM: Do you think animals are inherently funny?
DRS: No, I just used animals instead of people because I think that you can sort of sneak up on a reader that way. If you use people, people will think, “Oh my God, that’s me,” and then not want to finish reading it. But if you use an animal, they will read it and then at the end say, “Oh my god that’s me,” and you can sort of sneak up on them that way. It puts a bit of distance between the story and the reader.
4. FM: What work are you most proud of?
DRS: Golly. I’m not the biggest champion of my own writing. I liked a story “Nuit of the Living Dead” that I wrote about drowning a mouse in a bucket. I like the way that it kind of moves. It’s the sort of story that feels grown up to me, as much as a story about drowning a mouse in a bucket can feel grown up.
5. FM: If someone had never read any of your writing before, which collection or stories would you suggest they begin with?
DRS: I suppose I would suggest that one, and then it could all just be downhill from there. It would be a nice downhill ride.
6. FM: Most of your stories are about interesting life experiences. Do you think someone with a bland life can be a good humorist or writer?
DRS: Oh sure. I mean I think that one’s job is to make something out of nothing. My life is really unadventurous but that’s because I spend most of my time alone in a room writing. Big things don’t really happen in my life. Golly, my last story in The New Yorker was about standing in a line. Standing in a line getting a flight canceled happens to a lot of people and perhaps that’s why it works. The things that I do, the things I choose to write about, are pretty much the things that everybody does.
7. FM: Have you ever considered film adaptations of your works?
DRS: Right now a fellow named Kyle Alvarez is making a movie out of a story I wrote called “C.O.G.” The reasons I agreed to it were that a) I liked the first movie he made, and b) the story that he wants to adapt doesn’t involve my family. I’m in it, but none of my brothers or sisters are, or my mom. Because I so liked his first movie, I said OK. I don’t want any control over this movie. I don’t want script approval. I trust him. Most movies never get made, but I hope this one does because I just think so highly of this young man.
8. FM: What do you feel is the number one misconception that people have about you?
DRS: Oh gosh. Golly, I would have to probably read things about myself to know what their conceptions are. I don’t read anything, not reviews or interviews. I’m always surprised when I sign books and people hold back because they are afraid of me. And I think, really? What are you afraid of? I’m too timid to be mean to someone’s face. I don’t think people can tell when I don’t like them, which actually just makes someone so much scarier!
9. FM: Although holidays are often stressful, they seem to be a rich source of humor for you. What advice do you have for surviving the holiday season with your humor intact?
DRS: It’s all about gifts. Getting good gifts. A lot of people moan that they don’t get good gifts, but a lot of the time it’s your fault. If you get a bad gift, you have to say, “This is inappropriate; I would never want this.” My boyfriend Hugh, his family is more like “Did you get the e-mail I sent you for Christmas?” And it’s like “No, no, did you get the e-mail I wrote you about the computer I got you for Christmas?” As long as you make out gift-wise, there’s nothing not to like.
10. FM: Can you tell me about your practice of putting out a tip jar at readings?
DRS: That was several books ago. I feel like I really can’t do it again. I like to have a different theme for each tour, and that was my money-making tour. I made over $4,000 in tips. On this tour I’ve just been asking people for jokes and collecting jokes.
FM: What is the best joke you have collected so far?
DRS: I would say “What is the worst thing you can hear while you’re blowing Willie Nelson?” “I’m not Willie Nelson.” I mean the only reason you would blow him is because he’s Willie Nelson, so then to find out he’s not...(laughs)
11. FM: What is your opinion of Amy Hempel?
DRS: It’s so interesting because I just had coffee with Amy Hempel the day before yesterday. There are stories that Amy Hempel has written that I’ve read so many times I’ve memorized them. It’s hard to think of a writer that has had more of an influence on me than Amy Hempel. If you had told my younger self that he would ever sit down for coffee with Amy Hempel, I wouldn’t believe it. Sometimes you meet a writer and they disappoint you, but she doesn’t. Lorrie Moore, it was the same thing.
12. FM: What is your impression of Harvard?
DRS: Well, I did a few readings in that chapel at Harvard 10 years ago. I was always terribly Ivy League struck. I gave the commencement address at Princeton a few years ago. I think they give people modesty courses when they get in. It’s almost irritating to have it played down—you’re telling me that what I wanted my whole life isn’t worth it. And I refuse to believe that.
13. FM: How do you feel hearing that some of your work was taught in a Harvard course [English 185: Wit and Humor]?
DRS: Oh, I didn’t know that. I just feel awful that anyone would have to write a paper or be forced to read anything I’ve written.
14. FM: What advice do you have for aspiring writers or humorists?
DRS: My only advice would be to write every single day, and to read everything you can get your hands on. And then everything will take care of itself. If you write every day and read, you’re bound to get better. Impress upon students the need to have people within their network who provide “socio-emotional support.” I think to stay healthy as human beings, we need individuals to whom we can turn to confide almost anything.
15. FM: What career ambitions have you yet to fulfill?
DRS: Working at Waitrose. Waitrose is a supermarket chain in England, and I just got a green card, so I would like to see what I can do at Waitrose. Someone once told me, “Waitrose is just a cut above, isn’t it?” Which means its better than Tesco or Sainsbury’s. And that’s all I had to hear to know I wanted to work there.To be so lucky.

More than 50 freshmen showed up for the Undergraduate Council’s first-ever Annenberg debate Sunday night. Many of them came to brain break to eat s’mores and complain about drinking soda out of plastic bowls now that Harvard has stopped providing them cups. Yet they were able to voice these concerns directly to the individuals who are competing for the power to change such inconveniences. When a student voiced his concerns about the changes brought about by Green ’14, the freshman contingency of Harvard’s sustainability initiative, presidential candidate Collin A. Jones ’12 replied, “We don’t know what that is,” to which vice-presidential candidate Peter D. Davis ’12 added, “We don’t know what anything is.”
EXPERIENCES AND INEXPERIENCESThe Jones-Davis campaign had one unmistakably clear message to the freshmen that night. “We know that as freshmen, you probably don’t know anything about the Undergraduate Council,” said Jones. “We also don’t know anything about the Undergraduate Council.” The Jones-Davis ticket brings experience from all around campus. Jones is the media chair of Quincy’s House Committee, the general manager of The Hahvahd Tour, a member of the Harvard-Radcliffe Christian Fellowship, and a Quincy intramural representative. Davis is part of Harvard Undergraduate Television’s “On Harvard Time,” a member of the Harvard College Stand-Up Comic Society, an “LMAO: A Night of Comedy” performer, and a planner and host of Harvard Thinks Big. Together, Jones-Davis recently won the Delta Gamma trivia bowl 2010, where they beat out a former “Jeopardy” contestant and the captain of the Harvard Quiz Bowl team. The vibrancy of their campaign was on full view during the Annenberg debate.
THE DEBATEThe moderator was current UC Vice President Eric N. Hysen ’11, who asked a series of questions and then allowed freshmen to step up and ask their own. One concern was that freshmen don’t get to know their professors. Jones reassured the freshmen by referring to his relationship with Professor N. Gregory Mankiw, “He calls me Collin, I call him N.” Jones brushed aside the next concern—bad freshman advisors—with equal aplomb, assuring the Class of 2014 that should they be needed, “Pete and I are always available.” In response to the lack of a common social space for freshmen, Davis recommended the lobby in Sever and the freshman mail room. On technology, Jones explained, “I honestly don’t know where Drew Gilpin Faust is right now. But if she had a Twitter account, I would.” When a freshman asked about the role of the vice president, Davis replied, “If Collin Jones is assassinated in office, I am prepared to assume all duties.”Just this weekend, the Jones-Davis campaign experienced a burst in campus recognition when they purchased a frog with their leftover campaign money. They had $20.10 left in their budget to spend, and they polled students to decide how to spend it. The top result was to spend the money on a small animal, and so they bought a Cuban Tree frog. “In Cuba, they just call them frogs,” said Davis. “We could have made posters with our faces on them, or buttons with our names on them, but instead, we chose to make a little girl happy by the donating the frog to her, because that is what the student body wanted to do,” explained Jones.
THE THREE PILLARSThe three pillars of the Jones-Davis campaign are likely already known by those students who have visited their interactive website (www.jonesdavisuc.com) and watched the campaign videos. They are the following: Democracy, Safety, and Bringing Harvard into the 21st Century.“While all the other candidates are talking about student life, Jones-Davis is the only ticket committed to students’ lives and the preservation thereof,” says Luke A. Salisbury ’12, Head of Campaign Security and Personal Training for the Jones-Davis campaign. “Campus safety is one of the pillars of the Jones-Davis campaign, and in light of recent armed muggings in Harvard Yard, their campaign priorities have been vindicated.” Regarding pillar number three, Jones said, “One of our goals is to change the way UC campaigning is done. People don’t read articles, they watch YouTube videos. This is the 21st century.” Hysen himself says, “I think they are a very strong ticket, I think they raise incredibly valid points in their three pillars, and I like that they bought a frog.”
THE BOYSThe candidates speak admiringly of one another. “We’re both brains and brawn and heart and soul,” says Davis. Neither one of them claims to be the sole mastermind of the campaign. “We’re both masters of our own minds,” Jones says. They are both generous as well, and plan to extend power to their rival candidates should they reach office. They assured Senan Ebrahim ’12 of the Ebrahim-Cao ticket that if Jones-Davis is elected, Ebrahim would hold a high position alongside the winners. “Right there, close up to the top,” Jones assured him. “As close to the top as you can get,” agreed Davis. Their unconventional campaign is based on an unyielding devotion to Harvard. Neil T. Curran ’12, the Jones-Davis Executive of Quality Control, says, “If people think he is running a ‘joke’ campaign, I would like to point out that last year, the ‘joke’ candidate did win.” “We care deeply about this campus and the individuals on it,” says Jones. But for these candidates, it’s more than just that. “We’re mainly in this to meet girls.”

To many an undergraduate, the words “The Game” immediately bring to mind images of drinking, parties, and tailgates. But for the athletes around whom the Harvard-Yale game is actually centered, “pre-game” time has nothing to do with alcohol.
For many in-season athletes, limiting drinking is a given. This is especially true when it comes close to game time. So when other Harvard students prepare for Harvard-Yale by concocting ways to circumnavigate the University’s drinking rules, members of the football team will be preparing themselves mentally and physically to “conquer old Eli’s men.”
For many athletic teams, though, the rules for in-season lifestyle go beyond stipulations regarding drinking. From fencers to football players, social interactions, diet, and sleep schedules are guided by certain rules or expectations.
FAREWELL, FRIDAY NIGHT
Harvard athletes are expected to keep their team and its reputation in mind throughout their social interactions. To bring this point home, one of the football coaches forwards e-mails and information about instances of scandal or exploitation that took place elsewhere because of social networking sites.
Former varsity football player Ramsey R. Lafayette ’10-11 recalls an anecdote about an Olympic athlete being forced to step down because of risqué photos posted online. “It’s to remind us that being responsible on Facebook is really important...and how much more important it is now to be conscious of your digital presence as a representative of Harvard and of football,” says Lafayette.
There are other limitations on socializing that are more formalized. During the football season, players are allowed to go out only one night a week. Usually, players choose Saturday night. According to Lafayette, the one-night rule is typically followed without issue.
While he says that in general the restriction does not feel strict, he adds, “I do remember instances where I wanted to go to a concert during the week, and I wasn’t able to. Lots of sororities and other events on campus host week-time events, so...it is something you need to sacrifice.”
SUBTLE PRESSURE AND SELF-POLICING
Despite some teams’ formalized rules, the emphasis seems to be largely on self-policing. Varsity Football Coach Tim Murphy writes in an e-mail to The Crimson, “Our most important rule is ‘Don’t ever do anything that’s going to embarrass you, your family, or Harvard football.’ If you are smart enough to get into Harvard you shouldn’t need much other direction.”
Instead of fixed regulations, strong pressure is put on the players to do the right thing. Each week they go to weigh-ins, and are given different amounts of protein powder based on whether they are above or below goal weight. And while there is no specified curfew, 6:30 a.m. practices and early morning breakfasts on game days coerce players into going to bed earlier than they might otherwise.
Practice times are explicitly enforced. “If you’re late to a lift or meeting, you have quite of bit of physical—not really punishment—but a number of extra exercises to do that are not pleasant,” explains Lafayette.
SERVICE AND DEDICATION
Yet another unofficial rule is that the team intends to do one public service initiative each semester. In this the football team is not unique. This past Friday the fencing team organized their own public service; a bone marrow drive at the Malkin Athletic Center. The fencing team, even more so than the football team, relies on team members to maintain a responsible lifestyle for themselves.
“The coaches very much expect us to be able to take care of ourselves. We have to make sure that we are in the best condition,” says Benjamin G. White ’13, a member of the fencing team. “There aren’t rules, per se, but there are expectations,” he adds.
One of those expectations is that the week belongs to academics and to athletics. “Generally I just try to get my work done so I can go to bed early,” says Alexandra B. Kiefer ’14. Even on weekends, when there are no morning lifts, Kiefer says, “Coach emphasizes that we should try to limit the time that we spend partying. Most of the kids on the fencing team are self-driven toward healthier lifestyles.”
Ultimately, whether their coach takes a strong-handed approach or a laissez-faire one, how they live is up to the athletes themselves. White says, “For me it’s not about hitting the other person. Scoring a hit is a by-product of doing a particular action really well. And I love the feeling that, as a result, I’ve made this.” In the same manner, a touchdown or a goal is the result of months of sacrifice and work. Whether Harvard athletes specialize in football or footwork, they say success can make all the sacrifice worthwhile.

This November, Lawrence S. Cripe ’13 has class only three to four days a week. The reason isn’t because he’s a slacker—it’s because he’s busy networking in the financial world, where big banks don’t cater to the class schedules of college kids.
“A lot of times, it feels like a fifth or sixth class,” he says, “this month, I spent last Thursday and Friday at Barclay’s, this Friday at Goldman, and next Friday I’ll be at JP Morgan. They fly me out to New York at 6 or 7 in the morning and fly me back at 7:30 at night.”
For Cripe, balancing career aspirations with schoolwork consumes much of his waking life: doing homework in anticipation of missing Thursday and Friday classes; maintaining connections by sending an exhaustive number of e-mails, thank-you cards, and the like; annotating The Wall Street Journal and close-reading Vault Guide books.
These days, getting summer internships and jobs seems to be more competitive than ever. With rising numbers of applicants to top-tier schools, there is a commensurate increase in the number of applicants to so-called “top-tier” internship and job opportunities. In the business world, it’s the usual: Goldman Sachs, Blackstone Group, JP Morgan. And as people like Cripe see it, the traditional resume-in-the-mail approach has been eclipsed by the overwhelming necessity to make personal connections.
“When I came to college, I don’t think I really understood the necessity of networking. I assumed job searching and internship searching would be exactly like the college application process. When I got here, I realized that it’s very much a people game.”
THE PEOPLE GAME
Not everyone sees the same importance in networking. One member of the Class of 2012  taking a semester off to work at a major corporation in South Korea, where he is in the corporate development division, downplays the value of connections in closing the deal on an offer.
“I don’t necessarily agree that it’s ‘who you know,’ not ‘what you know.’ Having good connections will help you through the first-round interviews, but in the second-round interviews, connections are far less important than professionalism, preparedness, and communication skills,” he says.
He found his current job exclusively through Crimson Careers, the Office of Career Services’ online job database, which he also used to find his previous summer internship working in a mayor's office in California. He had a good experience with finding job opportunities through OCS, but again stresses his opinion that the job fair element of the OCS process was the least valuable.
“If you make a strong impression and have a good resume, you might get through the door, but in general, the relationships you build with representatives at job fairs are just not strong enough,” he says.
Although Cripe also applied for his first internship through OCS, he says that there was only so much that they were able to do for him.
“I think OCS does very much what Harvard does: ‘We have thousands of resources, here’s the door to them, you walk through it.’ They have contacts, but it’s very much in the Harvard strain," Cripe says. "If you want it, you better be putting in most of the effort, which is fine with me.”
Cripe, who is gay, acknowledges that he has a slight edge in his networking efforts because many large banks have specific programming for LGBT applicants, giving him a chance to make connections where others may not.
“It’s as simple as going to recruiting sessions and talking to one person for an hour—just one person,” Cripe explains. “I try to have the recruiters recognize me and get one or two people who will go to bat for me.”
Despite the obvious importance of one’s transcript, resume and interview, Cripe insists that in the end it may come down to one of these people. Cripe relates what he was told by one representative of a major bank, “He said it’s their rule of thumb that if they don’t know you and don’t have a record of having met you, they won’t interview you, no matter how qualified you are.”
ON THE OTHER COAST
In entertainment, there’s no disputing the primacy of networking. For students such as Sanyee Yuan ’12, a special concentrator in Narrative, Rhetoric, and Performance, OCS does not provide quite the same palette of options at job fairs. She described two disappointments. “[At on-campus job fairs] Disney looks for people to work in financial and business affairs—they weren’t looking for people to develop the films,” she says. “Same this year with Pixar. They were looking for people on the business side of things, not people to make their movies,” she says.
Yuan is an undergraduate liaison for Harvardwood, an alumni association of Harvard alums in Hollywood, created with the intent of connecting alumni and current Harvard affiliates who seek careers in entertainment, media, and the arts. For students like Yuan, Harvardwood provides an invaluable link to professionals in these fields.
For example, Yuan describes how Harvardwood once helped bring her closer to her dream job, hosting the (now-canceled) television show Total Request Live on MTV. Through an internship at the San Francisco Harvardwood offices, Yuan met someone who knew someone, who in turn knew a former producer of the television show TRL. By luck and persistence, she was able to schedule a brief meeting with this producer.
It turned out to be a valuable learning experience for Yuan. “I was checking in with the security guard, and he said, ‘What are you here for?’ And I said, ‘Just a talk,’ and he said, ‘No, you’re here to get a job.’ This was one of those moments when I thought, ‘Shoot, that should have been my perspective.’”
The meeting did not result in any job offer or internship, but it did leave her better prepared moving forward.
“I never know when someone’s going to help me in the future,” she says.
Madeleine A. Bennett ’11 is also a student liaison for Harvardwood and recalls that her successes at securing internships and jobs began with an intersession trip to Los Angeles sponsored by Harvardwood during her sophomore year. During the trip, she met professionals involved in the entertainment business and eventually secured an offer for the summer, interning at a firm in Los Angeles called Management 360. Through a positive relationship with her boss there who happened to work with Tobey Maguire, Bennett secured the opportunity to intern with the star himself.
“It’s funny looking back: Tobey Maguire is a vegan and he has a personal chef, and so when I would go to his house in the Hills to read him scripts for a few hours in the afternoon, I’d first get to lunch with him. I wasn’t being paid for the internship, so I was living couch to couch, but once a week I’d have this amazing meal with a movie star in Hollywood,” she says.
The gains of the networking game, though sometimes glamorous, aren’t always as tangible as say, an “A” smiling up with red-inked permanence from the corner of your latest paper. But regardless, the work is perpetual.
“You can never feel like you’ve done enough. There’s always one more person you could have talked to, there’s one more e-mail you could have sent, there’s one more connection you could have been able to make,” says Cripe. “There’s no completed project until you finally have the offer.”

Deep within the windowless basement of Sever, in the wee hours of the morning near the end of the semester, students can be found toiling away behind locked doors. Sound like some kind of torture? Actually, it’s Visual and Environmental Studies 50: “Fundamentals of Filmmaking.” The class is divided into two sections, one taught by Professor Alfred Guzzetti ’64 and the other by Roberto “Pacho” F. Velez ’02, himself a former student of VES 50. The class requires no prior experience and  lays down the basics of filmmaking. Early in the year, students learn how to operate a variety of expensive equipment—$50,000 worth, in fact—and view examples of nonfiction film done by professionals and past students. As students begin working on their own projects, class time becomes mostly devoted to critiquing each other’s work.
“We would watch everybody’s footage in class, and then everybody would comment on the different things that they liked, what they didn’t like, what could be improved,” says Eva M. Williams ’13, currently a student in the course. “There’s a lot of class participation and a lot of great feedback.”
BEGINNINGS
The first project the students work on is a light journal, for which they individually shot a silent, minute-long black-and-white film studying natural light in one location. For their second and final project this semester, students have paired up and are producing a documentary on the life of a specific person. In the weeks before the final project is due, the students are especially busy. According to Williams and her project partner Fanaye S. Yirga ’13, the pair will spend over 80 hours filming, syncing, editing, and re-editing their film by Thanksgiving.
Shooting the footage involves staying flexible—while they usually have an idea of what they would like to get on film, things don’t always go according to plan.
“You just have to roll with it,” says Yirga. “A lot of times you can’t enter a process thinking the end result is going to be the same as what you initially think it’s going to be. So you have to keep an open mind and be open to changing things.”
Next, with all their raw footage, they synchronize the audio with the visual—sound and image are on separate rolls—and create a rough cut, in which the scenes are not yet in the final order. Williams and Yirga are currently working on the final version.
IN EDITS
The film medium provides an extra challenge. Unlike video, which is electronic, film is a physical medium involving 18-pound Aaton cameras and thousands of feet of cellulose triacetate. Because the supplies are costly and limited, students must be careful when handling film to prevent premature exposure and potentially disastrous damage.
“Anytime you want to edit something, you need to not only cut the picture, but also cut the sound, make sure they stay exactly matched up, and then keep them on rolls together,” says former VES 50 student Jackie P. Palumbo ’11. Otherwise, the entire project could be destroyed.
Working with film can be tedious, but the VES faculty believes it is a good learning experience. The students acknowledge—albeit at times grudgingly—what they have to gain from it.
“Now we live in a digital age, where people are using digital cameras,” says Williams. “Those things do focus, they do exposure, they do all of these things. The great thing about film is that it really teaches you how to use a camera, what to do with your lens.”
“It forces you to stop and look at the world and decide what it is you really want and make sure you have that on film,” says Palumbo.
A BIG IN-VES-TMENT
In addition to the seven hours spent in class each week, students can devote over twenty hours per week to their projects outside of class.
“It’s like writing a book,” says Guzzetti. “It takes a long time to make a movie. There’s no way of speeding it up.”
Given the time-consuming nature of the class, it is not surprising that students who take VES 50 are very dedicated to it. Many students are or will be VES concentrators, and those on a different track nevertheless possess a passion for film. Instead of taking Veteran’s Day off like the rest of the College, Williams’s class chose to meet for two hours to get extra feedback on their projects.
“There’s a sense of fulfillment knowing that you built something from the ground up,” says Williams.
“When my family came up to visit, I was able to go and project film,” says Palumbo. “Being able to see the stuff on the screen and be like, ‘I made that, and now this is a permanent thing that exists that I created’—I thought that was awesome.”

J. Press and Urban Outfitters are taking the maxim that opposites attract to a whole new level.
Over the past month, the blogosphere has been bustling with news about a collaboration between J. Press, the century-old preppy collegiate menswear label, and Urban Outfitters, the clothing chain popular with a young hipster demographic, to produce a fall collection.
The line, which went live on UrbanOutffiters.com last week and will premier in stores in December, features “preppy casuals mixed with classic basics and relaxed styling,” according to an official press release from Urban Outfitters. Selections include a Black Watch tartan golf jacket, slim-fit pants and shirts in a variety of colors like Yale grey, Columbia blue, and Princeton orange.
“We wanted to recreate the height of traditional Ivy League style in the early ’60s,” said design director Mikito Takeshima.
The 20-piece collection, influenced by the 1978 film “Animal House,” was designed by J. Press and manufactured by Urban Outfitters vendors. A blazer is priced at $148, compared with $495 to $895 at J. Press.
“I thought somebody was pulling my leg,” said A. John Tinseth, owner of TheTrad.blogspot.com, one of the first independent fashion blogs to break the news earlier this month. “There’s been a lot of things mentioned about J. Press lately, but that was the most bizarre thing I’ve heard.”
“At the outset, it seems a Machiavellian thing to do on J. Press’ part,” Tinseth said, believing that the collection would introduce the brand to a young market with a flair for the inexpensive and disposable. “But what came out was a cheaply made, almost unwearable line of clothing.”
The initial reaction from some Harvard students toward the alliance was intrigue mixed with skepticism.
“It sounded a little strange,” said Phillip Y. Zhang ’12, former executive producer of Identities, a major fashion show on campus. “But when you think about it, they make a good team in terms of branding and marketing.”
Parker L. Wright ’11, a frequent J. Press customer who described his style as “dress-down prep with slim fits,” expressed uncertainty. “J. Press is old world, Urban Outfitters is for hipsters who don’t know how to dress,” he said. “The combination of the two could work, but I doubt it will.”
The verdict is still out on this ticket, but for Tinseth, one thing is certain. “Do I like the line? Not so much. Do I understand it? Absolutely,” he said. “I bought a lot of stupid things when I was 19.”

“Okay, let’s go around the room and everyone say their name, year, and one interesting fact about himself.”
Shit.
I always hated this icebreaker, even more than the personal trait scavenger hunts or the two-truths-and-a-lie game (I always told three lies; the Neil Klatskin Day Camp staff of Tenafly, N.J. thinks that I was a series regular on “ZOOM” in 1999).
And then I got to Harvard, and this game became the worst. I started learning that people had all these incredibly interesting and life-defining accomplishments: spelling bee champion, Broadway starlet, vaccine inventor, all just in my entryway. When the question was thrown back at me, not much came to mind, except...
I produced YouTube videos.
They weren’t good or popular YouTube videos, like the psychology experiment (I didn’t even see the gorilla), lip-syncing midgets, or an “Arrested Development” chicken dance compilation—the functional definition of a good YouTube video. They were sketches and shorts I did with friends or for my high school administration that piqued my interest enough to study film at a university.
And now here I am at college, and I, along with a relatively small number of individuals, decided to dedicate 6/7 of my week to writing, directing, editing, and producing YouTube videos. I’ve pledged every ounce of free time I have to an art form that has a 15-minute time limit, allows you to choose your video quality, and regularly puts advertisements for real-life movies ahead of my own. Day after day, I am bested by children getting punched in the face, news anchors cursing on air, and reality TV stars...also getting punched in the face.
Sure, YouTube has its downsides. The interface is so interactive that it’s hard to retain people. You can get someone to click on your link, but the drop-off is quick when there’s so much content in one place. No matter how many hours I put into producing something, I always lose to boobs. If a video has boobs as its screenshot and it’s in the related video section, it’s getting clicked. You can’t beat boobs on YouTube. And of course, there are the comments. As hurtful and profane as they may be, YouTube comments might be some of the funniest, bluntest critiques you’ll ever read. The lurkers who comment on YouTube videos can get pretty real. “Those are eight minutes of my life that I will never have back.” Too real, sometimes.
But YouTube is also a great vehicle for aspiring filmmakers. It’s accessible—clicking on YouTube links has become second nature. There’s anonymity in the hyperlink that can lead to someone sticking around who otherwise might not have clicked. There’s an audience of almost 500 million people who may just stumble upon your work. Great content is also mixed in with mind-numbing sneezing panda videos. To anyone who says otherwise, I argue that some of the best movies ever made are on YouTube. You just need to watch them in 13 or 14 parts.
I admit, video-streaming websites aren’t as glamorous as, say, a 70-year-old theater or an attractively designed page layout, but when it comes to distributing student-produced content, they do the trick. They’re the simplest means of putting stuff up on the web hassle-free and payment-free. But there’s still a cost—that inevitable association with memes and rick-rolls and a general aura of, well, unserious content.
That sucks. Student filmmaking is one of the most collaborative processes I’ve participated in. Especially at Harvard, where there’s only so many people with the knowledge to share or the enthusiasm for the process. Every actor, writer, and theater director will tell you they have an interest in producing video content, but comparatively we’re a small bunch. That’s because filmmaking is tough.
And nothing better parallels the difficulties of filmmaking than the restrictions presented by YouTube: time constraints, increasingly and unfortunately variable quality of content, and distractions everywhere to prevent a project from being finished. And of course, there is that perpetual, ongoing association with unseriousness. It’s hard to shake. I’ve worked with some fantastic writers, cinematographers, directors, composers and actors whose efforts are too easily lost in the grimy, brainless channels of a website that so perfectly embodies our culture.
You can claim YouTube is just a website for funny gags and attempts at fame (not to say that that would be so bad), but it’s also a great place to get started. And there’s some good stuff out there.
But if I’m producing YouTube videos professionally in five years, here’s written permission to punch me in the face.

James and Nicole stop the first person of the day in front of the Museum of Natural History.
“Hi,” James says to a young woman wearing a black jacket and walking quickly. “Me and my friends were just walking around campus praying...”
Even though she’s almost past him, James starts to ask how he can pray for her today.
She turns to give him a look of disgust and picks up her pace.
James shrugs. “We get rejected a lot.”
James is wearing a windbreaker and carrying a giant umbrella because it just stopped raining. A college pastor, he has also worked as a civil engineer since graduating from college in 2008.
Walking back through Old Yard, James gets a friendlier response. He approaches a student who’s clutching some papers and jogging in the direction of the Science Center. “How are you today?” James asks.
“I’m doing great, but I’m in a huge hurry,” the student says, smiling but barely breaking stride.
James turns to me and asks, “Are a lot of people in hurries?”
I tell him the student was probably on his way to turn in a problem set, but he’s right. Many people are walking too fast or too purposefully for him to catch their attention. Finally, they manage to stop someone. Behind Widener, James spots a young man wearing a cast. “Hey bro,” he calls out. The student stops, and James gives his pitch. Smiling, he agrees to let James and Nicole pray for his injury, but not while he’s there because he has to run off to a meeting.
“We believe in your power and ask you to heal, in Jesus’ name,” James prays as he leads us back into Tercentenary Theatre.
James and Nicole, who do “prayer walks” at Harvard on Friday mornings, asked that neither their real names nor the name of their church be used because they are concerned about potential ramifications for their relationship with the University. Their church, which runs “faith groups” at several local colleges, recently established one catering to Harvard students. In addition to the prayer walks, they hold fellowship meetings at Nicole’s apartment near campus. Nicole, who majored in athletic-training, is spending this year after graduation taking classes in preparation for going overseas as a missionary.
I first heard of James and Nicole’s group in August when a tall young man wearing a dress shirt and slacks stopped and offered to help me carry some gear back to the Outing Club. As we walked down Plympton Street, he told me he was on campus doing a prayer walk.
Until then, I had thought the only group doing prayer walks on campus was the Justice House of Prayer Boston. Since June I had been attending meetings for thesis research at their house in Central Square, established as a chapter of the national JHOP after Lou Engle held one of his The Call to Conscience rallies in Boston. Engle—an evangelical pastor considered a prophet, recently in the news for being the former roommate of Kansas Governor-elect Sen. Sam Brownback (R-Kansas), allegedly supporting Uganda’s anti-homosexuality bill, and likening Sarah Palin to the biblical Queen Esther during her vice presidential bid—founded JHOP after 40 days of prayer and fasting in Boston in March 2006. Engle and others in the prophetic movement identify New England, and Boston specifically, as a site ripe for religious revival, in the tradition of the First and Second Great Awakenings.
Last October Engle spoke at an event hosted by JHOP in the Student Organization Center at Hilles. In the spring, the International House of Prayer—a Kansas City ministry where Engle also sits on the board of directors and with which JHOP works closely—sent about 300 student missionaries from its IHOP University to campus as part of a broader New England outreach. For a few days, these students from IHOP—which was named as a defendant in a September 2010 lawsuit by the International House of Pancakes for trademark dilution and infringement—approached Harvard students, praying for healing and salvation.
When they returned to Kansas City, another IHOP director, Allen Hood, wrote on his blog that some of the students had met a basketball player on crutches, prayed for him, and watched him walk away without his crutches. “Soon, our IHOPU students were receiving phone calls from Christian students on campus: ‘The word is out all over campus that a basketball player was healed by those Jesus people who have invaded our school!’” Hood wrote.
As Brandyn T. Curry ’13 tells it, he was passing the John Harvard statue when a group of people stopped him and asked, “Can we pray for you?”
He was on crutches following a knee operation earlier that day, to fix a tear in his patella, an injury he says came from “normal wear and tear” playing point guard on the varsity basketball team. The doctors had told him to use the crutches for a week or two, and that it would take from four to six months to recover fully.
The missionaries from IHOP wanted to pray for his knee to heal. He agreed.
“I didn’t know what was going to happen,” he says.
They prayed, and then asked him to try walking without his crutches.
“I just felt good and I walked on it,” he says, adding that he didn’t use his crutches to walk away.
“I’m a strong believer in God,” he says, adding that he grew up in the Baptist church and is active in a Christian fellowship on campus, attending Harvard College Faith and Action’s Bible studies.
Curry’s take on the situation seems a little less dramatic than Hood’s. He describes feeling stronger when they prayed for him, and he says his recovery was shorter than expected, clocking in at just under four months. Curry says he reserved serious spiritual discussion of the event for fellow Christians, such as his mother. With others, he just talks about how his leg felt better and confirms that yes, it really happened.
But JHOP, whose permanent mission is to pray for Harvard, does not interact much with students or the campus. Darrell Temple, who directs JHOP Boston with his wife Bethany Yeo Temple, says the goal for Harvard is to “cover it in prayer.”
Darrell used to be a guitarist and vocalist for a Christian rock band called The End of Silence. In its heyday, they opened for big-name Christian contemporary acts such as Delirious and Newsboys. He maintains a garage-band aesthetic, constantly wearing Chuck Taylors and fitted T-shirts, and sipping a Rockstar energy drink. He still plays guitar and sings for the praise and worship music at JHOP’s Wednesday and Saturday “prayer watches.”
For Temple, “covering” a place in prayer seems to be an abstract—but in the context of a totally spiritualized world, not completely abstract—aim to pray ceaselessly. But while they believe prayer is important enough that the one requirement for living in JHOP’s upstairs apartments is to spend one hour alone each day in the prayer room, they also believe that, ultimately, only God can effect the change they pray for.
Missy, a member of James and Nicole’s church who asked that only her first name be used, offers a more literal take on “covering” Harvard in prayer. She says she used to take her shift praying for Harvard at 2 a.m. That way, she says, yawning and stretching as if she’s just waking up, students could start the day already covered in prayer.
Terms like “humanism” and “intellectualism” are often bandied at the “prayer watches,” often in the context of petitions for God to “break through the spirit of intellectualism.” JHOP’s website declares, “Harvard is considered the citadel of secular humanism in the modern world.”
“We are kind of just praying against that attitude that tries to suffocate the reality of there being a God,” Temple says. On their website and at meetings, people in JHOP frequently invoke Harvard’s religious roots as a justification for their mission.
Temple softens this idea, saying Harvard was founded as “a place where folks could be educated, not necessarily just in a secular society but also a Christian society, you know; not necessarily saying one’s better than the other and whatnot, but just that there could be room for both.”
Brian Lahoue, the pastor of The Awakening Harvard Square—a church Lahoue founded in 2009 that meets in the penthouse suite of an apartment on Brattle Street—says people all over the world pray for Harvard. “It’s no mystery, I think it’s the same reason so many people are trying to hire students from Harvard University,” he says. “There is an understanding that students who attend Harvard have the potential for greater influence than someone else who didn’t.”
Temple echoes this theme. “Just as so many leaders come out of Harvard, so many influential people come out of Harvard, so many people that write laws, so many people in Hollywood, just throughout all influential sectors of our culture, a lot of those people come from that college campus,” he says.
James explains that his group also hopes to take advantage of influence, though he is more explicit about framing it not as political influence but as “influence to lead people to Jesus.” But nearly every person I have met at JHOP as well as James and Nicole have mentioned Harvard’s Christian heritage in our first or second conversation. When I stopped by a Tuesday night meeting in Nicole’s apartment, she showed me a notebook she had painted with an intricate design of ivy twining over bricks and a Harvard seal, and told me about how she started researching Harvard’s history.
Darrell says a historian—he tells me the historian is a lawyer and a Christian but will not tell me his name—briefed the participants on the history of Harvard at the 40-day initiative to launch JHOP Boston.
Everyone tells me the story about Emerson Hall. When the philosophy building was being constructed in 1900, so the story goes, there was a heated debate about what to inscribe on the side. Supposedly, the architect, Guy Lowell, wanted “Man is the measure of all things.” The committee agreed, but University President Charles W. Eliot, Class of 1853, apparently had something else in mind. When the cloth was torn down to unveil the inscription, there on the side of the building was a verse from the Bible, from Psalm 8, “What is man that thou art mindful of him?”
The people who tell me this usually mark Eliot’s last-minute decision to replace Pythagoras with the psalmist as one of Christianity’s last stands at Harvard. What they don’t mention is that Eliot was a Unitarian. They tell me that the official University seal includes three books, all of which are open face-up. Once upon a time, one of the books—a Bible—was facing down, to represent limits to mortal knowledge.
Unlike the group James and Nicole lead, JHOP focuses more on praying for the institution than interacting with students. Temple says that though one of the things they pray for is the salvation of students, and that Christians who have fallen away from the faith will return, they have never tried to evangelize students.
“The idea was to really just pinpoint it in prayer, not to do anything more than that,” he says.
JHOP is funded largely by donations and employs several full-time and part-time intercessory missionaries—usually young adults—who live at the house in Central Square and spend time praying and studying the Bible as well as doing administrative work. Over the summer, Will, one of JHOP’s two full-time staff members who live at the house and who asked that only his first name be used, led weekly prayer walks at Harvard on Thursday afternoons. At various points since its founding, JHOP’s prayer walks have taken on different forms and frequencies, but they’ve always stayed mostly outside the gates.
Originally from New Hampshire, Will is 20 years old and a talented violinist and pianist. He’s perpetually brushing his long blond hair out of his face, except when he ties a bandana or a leather cord around his head. He’s thin, and seems thinner because I know he fasts a lot. He wears a red rubber anti-abortion “Life” bracelet and somehow sounds both intense and a bit dazed as he describes prophetic dreams he’s had, or an experience where he prayed for 12 hours and then had non-stop visions, as if he were “plugged into a fiber-optic main-Oframe of pretty much everything that’s going on in the world.” Among his duties are playing keyboard and drums at the prayer watches, maintaining JHOP Boston’s website, and leading the prayer walks at Harvard.
On a typical Thursday, Will arrived at Out of Town News at noon and waited for others who might be joining him. Sometimes with other staff, and sometimes alone, he would lead a slow, silent stroll around the brick path outside the Yard’s gates, ending at the side steps of Emerson Hall. There, the walkers would sit and quietly pray, in English and in tongues. Once the sound of a jackhammer at the Fogg Museum pushed Will to relocate to the steps of Widener Library.
In September, JHOP’s prayer walk schedule changed. Now they skip the walk and just meet on Emerson’s steps at 1 p.m. most weekdays. Sometimes Will sits on the steps alone with his bike for about 20 minutes, and sometimes another staff member joins him.
Will says no one has ever asked him what he’s doing when he’s prayer-walking or sitting on Emerson’s steps, though occasionally others are sitting on the steps of Emerson when he gets there.
“Other than walking the campus, walking around the circle of the campus, and then walking through the campus and praying under our breath or whatever; that was the extent of what we were to do,” Temple says. “Our ministry was before God and unto God, and that was, and still is, in a way, the reality that we’re trying to live in.”
On the Friday morning I tag along with James and Nicole, we meet at Au Bon Pain at 11 a.m. Missy’s there too, with a young woman from Texas she just met who is now staying with her while she’s in the city. Before we start, James and the others pray, asking God to show them whom to talk to or where to go. They do, and Missy shares first. “I got a picture of a lion,” she says, interpreting this to stand for courage. “I also got a picture of someone smoking outside the science building.”
Nicole says she saw a green tree but doesn’t spend time analyzing the image.
“Mine was really random,” James says. “I got a picture of a kangaroo.”
With that, we start for the Yard. Missy and her friend split off, and I go with Nicole and James. As we cut across on the path in front of Grays, James prays for God to open students’ hearts. We pass in between Weld and University Hall, and I notice something on top of one of those posts that deter cars and bikes. I drop behind so I can look closer. It is a tiny pink plastic kangaroo.
My first thought is that James planted it, but neither he nor Nicole stop. They don’t seem to have seen it.
When we wind around behind Canaday, Nicole remarks that a student who attends the Tuesday night meetings at her apartment lives there. They pray for her by name, and then generally for students who live in Canaday.
“God, we pray for those who are depressed and are suicidal,” James says as we walk toward Northwest Labs, just loud enough that the people passing on the sidewalk are bound to overhear. Near the museum, James unsuccessfully tries to stop the woman in the black jacket.
We walk past the Science Center, but there are no smokers in sight. It occurs to me that James may have seen the plastic kangaroo and registered it only subliminally. I ask him about the route he took to get to Au Bon Pain, to see if he walked the Yard, but he says he walked down Harvard Street and Mass Ave.
“Hey, Jesus loves you,” Missy shouts as she and her friend pass by on the opposite side of the triangle formed by the paths in front of Weld. We meet the student with the cast, and as we round the corner of Widener, they pray for him to be healed.
From here I can see the silhouette of the kangaroo figurine. But we head toward the Science Center again (still no smokers), and circling back James stops a young man wearing Harvard gear in front of Hollis and asks if he can pray for him.
“I’m good, thanks,” he says, shaking James’s outstretched hand.
“What’s your name?” James asks.
“I’m good,” he says, walking quickly away.
“I’m good,” James echoes, laughing and marveling that the kid wouldn’t give his name. “It was funny, because he held onto my hand,” he says.
Memorial Church’s bells start ringing for noon. Twenty minutes until we have to meet Missy and her friend. We start heading in what might be a path toward Weld. But we go around the other side. There’s a smartly dressed man sitting on a little cement block next to the library. He’s got a leather pouch and a bag of loose tobacco, and he’s holding a cigarette.
James introduces himself and explains what he and Nicole are doing. I miss the opportunity to introduce myself, and I stand off to the side, silently taking notes, while this man—who attended an evangelical college but conspicuously does not say anything about his beliefs—talks with James and Nicole about his Christian relatives, including the brother-in-law he’s visiting at Harvard, and his plans to open a bar. While James prays aloud for the brother-in-law to find community and for the man’s business venture to succeed, the man bows his head but instead of folding his hands, he twists his fingers, and lets his shrinking cigarette drop to the ground.
When they’ve finished, James hands him a card with his church’s schedule and his own contact info and tells him to have his brother-in-law be in touch.
Once again we walk into Tercentenary. We’re getting down to the wire. If James is going to lead us over to the kangaroo, he’d better do it soon. But we just do one last small circle and head back to Au Bon Pain.
Missy and her friend are waiting for us, excited to tell us how they found the woman in the red jacket and the red hat they were looking for. I had forgotten this particular vision. “We saw a lot of smokers outside the Science Center,” Missy says. James talks about the boy with the cast and the man visiting his brother-in-law. I ask if they saw the kangaroo. They think it’s cool, but not a big deal. I appreciate that they don’t try to use this as evidence for anything.
I say good-bye and return, alone, to the post by Weld, but the kangaroo is gone.
A few hours after the prayer walk I see the freshman with the cast again and ask him why he talked to Nicole and James. “I would like to give people the time of day,” says the student, who doesn’t want to be identified by name. But he says the practice of approaching strangers to pray people seems inherently uncomfortable.
“It puts people in an awkward situation,” he says, adding that he’s Catholic. “I think the intention’s good.”
Just to check, I ask whether he’s ever seen people prayer-walking at Harvard before. He hasn’t.
A student who lives at JHOP while studying in a Ph.D. program at Harvard, who asked not to be identified by name, says she frames what she’s praying for differently than do others at JHOP who aren’t also enmeshed in the University.
She says she felt “spiritually depressed” when she visited Harvard after being accepted to her Ph.D. program. “I was walking around Harvard Square crying,” she says. “Spiritually, I was like, ‘I hate this place. I don’t know why.’”
Three years ago, she moved into one of JHOP’s upstairs rooms that at the time were rented out as Christian community living, and joined the staff as a part-time member. Eventually she had a better understanding of her initial sense that Harvard was a sad and cutthroat place. She says that in academia, and to some extent the world in general, “there’s two factors by which people are measured: are you smart enough, and do you work hard enough?”
“Not only have I seen God free me,” she says, “I desire those same things for people who are stressed out at school and are always paranoid about everything.”
While others at JHOP might talk about Harvard in tactical terms, or call it “a stronghold of humanism,” she thinks of her personal experience.
“That is why I pray,” she says. “I don’t want people to live under that depression or that kind of burden.”
A few weeks after attending one of JHOP’s prayer watches for the first time, I sit down with Will at Starbucks on Church Street after a Thursday prayer walk. He tells me about how, before he ever saw the house on Western Avenue, where its porch columns distinguish it from the others on the street, he had a dream where he saw a house that looked like “a tiny little Supreme Court.”
He tells me about his favorite part of his job at JHOP, the monthly “Silent Siege” on the steps of Boston’s John Adams Courthouse, where participants stand for two hours with red tape over their mouths to pray and protest against abortion.
“I don’t know what it is about standing in front of a place with tape on your mouth,” he says with a laugh, adding later, “You must think we’re completely weird.”
I ask him what it would look like if the Christian revival JHOP was praying for happened. He agrees “revival” is a hard concept to define, and possibly just as difficult to recognize. He says students’ priorities would shift; for instance, they would not value entertainment so highly.
But, he says, one Christian Harvard professor says he’s seen more people come to Christ in the last four years—since JHOP’s been around—than in the last 20. I ask him who the professor was. He says he doesn’t know his name, but if he did it wouldn’t be his place to tell me.
“In the intellectualism of our day, we think that man has all the power to solve the problems of the world,” Lahoue says. “And since these intellectual ideas so often sound good—and it’s not that they’re bad, they are good—but without the love for the person, without the compassion, and without understanding what the right tool is, which is this hope I believe that Jesus describes clearly, unequivocally, in the gospels, it’s a frustrated effort.”
Lahoue, a businessman as well as a pastor, originally called his church the Harvard Awakening until the University told him to change the name. Unaffiliated with the University, Lahoue and his church conduct outreaches in Harvard Square, setting up a table rather than approaching people. The Awakening Harvard Square has co-hosted events with several of the College’s Christian fellowships and taken out ads on the shuttles, but Lahoue is quick to point out that despite Harvard’s appeal as an influential place with Christian roots, even without those factors, “It would still be my aim to pray for Harvard as a university—as a place—that molds the minds of young people.”
Even though many of the Harvard-related prayers at JHOP prayer meetings—and much of what they pray for is not related to Harvard—take aim at broad ideas such as humanism, or the history of the Universtiy, on their own, Will and Temple both stress a more individualized mission.
Temple estimates he has talked with or prayed with about 60 Harvard students and affiliates. His wife, whom Engle personally reached out to as a “spiritual daughter” to lead JHOP Boston, has met with Harvard chaplains.
At a prayer meeting around the time of freshman move-in, he describes sitting at Boloco, eating a burrito and watching the crowds of students who had arrived that day. He says he spotted a young man stumbling along, struggling to move his belongings to his new apartment. Temple stopped and offered to help the student, who turned out to be an atheist. “I shared Jesus,” Temple says, calling on the others at JHOP to do the same. Later in the meeting, they pray for the atheist by name.
The prayers gradually become more specific; “God, would you release salvation on the hearts of men at Harvard,” leads to “Would you break into atheists’ dreams, God?”
“Father, I cry out for Greg,” Temple says, “That you would multiply the seed that I sowed in his heart. Would you come to him?”
A few months after our Starbucks conversation, I’m reminded of Will’s question, when he asked me if I think they’re completely weird. A few minutes before a Saturday night prayer meeting staff members have come downstairs, and guests are trickling in. Everyone is lounging in the prayer room’s comfortable earth-tone furniture, and the TV, which is usually tuned to a live stream of IHOP’s prayer room, is off. Everyone seems to be in a really good mood. Will is trying to zip his gray hoodie over his face.
Temple has just realized he can’t find his car keys. The other staff and guests call out suggestions while he searches the prayer room and the adjacent kitchen. The part-time staffer tells him God had given her a vision that the keys were still in the trunk. She says it like she’s kidding, but she’s not, not really. Temple insists that he already checked, but when he can’t find them anywhere inside, he goes out again. A moment later he comes back, holding the keys. The part-time staffer grins.
“The Lord speaks to me,” she shrugs.
It’s tempting to be a little amazed, but by now I expect this sort of thing. The prophets joke about being prophets.
“You said they were in the trunk,” Temple protests, explaining that he’d found them stuck in the front door of his car.
The staffer shrugs and explains that her vision had been of the keys in a keyhole. She has automatically interpreted the metal surrounding the keyhole as the trunk. There’s a regular attendee with a scraggly orange beard and combat boots. I’ve almost never heard him say anything, but now he offers what sounds like a rule he’s learned by heart, a basic principle in dealing with prophetic visions: “You gotta say what you see.”

I don’t agree with being “fashionably late.” Lateness is rudeness, and there is nothing fashionable about that. So when Brandon strolled into the Adams Gold Room at exactly 6:00 p.m., I fell in platonic love. The new campus networking service Harvardlunch.com seemed to be pulling through—­but I still had my doubts.
We both had the same goal: “to meet and/or network with people we might not otherwise meet in the Harvard community.” There were no flowers, no first-date jitters. All I’d had to do was enter in my name, e-mail address, and House, and Harvardlunch.com had set me up with the friend I had been looking for: a punctual Asian male freshman who knew how to network a girl.
Although we were catching dinner rather than lunch, the dim lighting and soft clinking of silverware failed to attribute an air of romanticism to our meeting. Sitting at a secluded table in the far end of the dining hall, he told me about the Business School events that he had been attending between bites of pad thai. Having never been an “events” person myself, I was content to simply listen, sighing gently as he slowly revealed his long, hard resume of classes and activities: Math 25, CS 61, the Harvard Financial Analysts Club.
As we transitioned from tech entrepreneurship to dining hall restrictions, we were suddenly joined by two of my friends and one of his. If I were on any other date, I would have shot our new companions a death stare for their blatant cock-blocking, or perhaps given them a relieved smile, thankful to be saved from mindless conversation. But not with Brandon, and certainly not with HarvardLunch.
Instead of discussing the long walk from the Union Dorms to Annenberg, we were now listening to my slightly drunken friend discuss how his parents chose his name—something about “vaginal forces” squeezing his head into a distorted shape. And as we were laughing, with surprisingly minimal awkwardness, I realized, this is what HarvardLunch is all about. It brought together a business-minded freshman (with, I emphasize again, a wonderful sense of punctuality), a slightly less-than-academically-minded sophomore, and a small gathering of said sophomore’s mildly inebriated friends—all for an easygoing, no-strings-attached meal.
Sometimes, when I’m lying in my bed alone late at night, I start to wonder about Brandon and where he is now. The week that has passed since our fateful first meeting now feels as though it has stretched into eternity. I can only hope that Brandon is somewhere out there, networking some other girl like he networked me.

Since campaigning officially began last Monday night, the Coe-Li ticket has been working hard to imprint its message across Harvard’s campus. Ubiquitous yellow posters advertise an unswerving commitment to the demands of the student body: “A UC That Sees You. Your Ideas. Your Harvard.” Wherever the ideas come from, however, the energy behind the campaign springs from its namesakes: Matthew S. Coe-Odess ’12 and Tengbo Li ’12, running mates for Undergraduate Council President and Vice President.
THE CHARMER
Coe-Odess is a self-confessed sports geek from Los Angeles, Calif., with a secret penchant for the poetry of Catullus. As a sophomore, he joined the UC out of frustration at the Council’s detachment from the insights and opinions of the student body. “I was tired of great ideas falling on deaf ears,” he says. Since then, the psychology concentrator from Kirkland House found himself at the head of the Social Life Task Force and later taking over as Parliamentarian in the wake of last year’s election controversy.
In October, he was approached by Li—the Education Committee Chair—to run together for UC President and Vice President. The rest is history, although it’s not a history the freshman Coe-Odess would have predicted for himself. “This definitely isn’t something I thought I’d be doing,” he muses.
But it really does seem to fit him. As he knocks on doors in Holworthy Central, rousing freshmen from their weekend slumber, Coe-Odess seems completely at ease, following every sentence with a chuckle and a disarming smile. Some might even liken his charm and campaigning techniques to that of current president Johnny F. Bowman ’11.
After shaking the hand of everyone in the room, he launches into his pitch for improving life for Harvard’s newest class. He tells them about expanding Annenberg’s hours and about shopping TFs. He tells them about his “pet project,” the free “Crimson Spirit” shirts given out to students on the UC’s dollar. And he tells them about his belief in listening to the students: he asks them if they have any ideas and tells them to e-mail him if they come up with any.
This part of the job is all about direct representation. Coe-Odess boasts that he visited over 500 students in October to get input for the Social Life Task Force; now he is back sharing those ideas with the rest of the freshman class.
Walking with confidence through the Yard, Coe-Odess is tirelessly friendly. By the time the votes are counted, he and Li will have knocked on every freshman door. That makes for a lot of doors, but the would-be UC President seems unfazed. “I’m a natural socializer and I’m not really BSing anyone,” he says.
Coe-Odess is escorted through Holworthy by Warner J. Wood ’14, a UC representative who supports the Coe-Li campaign—and who nearly matches the presidential candidate for enthusiasm on the trail.
Wood was drawn to the ticket by Coe-Odess’ magnetic force and believes in him strongly enough to bring him home to his fellow dorm dwellers. “I’m supporting him more for personal reasons,” Wood explains. “Even before he wanted to be UC president, Matt was the most outgoing, friendly and nice person to me. That’s the kind of image I think Harvard should be promoting.”
THE PARTNER
Coe-Odess has dropped the second part of his last name for the election, allowing a more equitable distribution of poster room with his running mate Li. The potential vice president’s background in education on the UC makes theirs a natural union.
An economics concentrator in Pforzheimer House, Li has a wide history of involvement in campus life—from the Harvard Undergraduate Research Journal to the Institute of Politics and CIVICS, a program run jointly by the Phillips Brooks House Association and IOP.
Coe-Odess is upbeat about their combination. “I’m head of social life and he’s head of education—they’re the two most important umbrellas,” he says.
Despite their different backgrounds, they’re on the same page when it comes to engaging the student body. Li’s biography on the Coe-Li campaign site includes a striking promise. “He aims to invite every Harvard student to the first UC general meeting of the spring where ideas will be shared and mounds of buffalo wings, Tengbo’s go-to meal, will be consumed.”
The ticket has come under criticism for having less experience than competitors Senan Ebrahim ’12 and Bonnie Cao ’12, but Coe-Li insists that they have enough—and that their ideas are most important.
The outcome of the long campaign will be counted this Thursday at lunchtime. Coe-Odess plans to be napping or catching up on long-neglected classwork that afternoon, resigned to whichever outcome comes his way.
They are behind in the endorsement race—the score was 23 to seven when the magazine went to print—but Coe-Li has at least claimed one important coup in Pinocchio’s Pizza and Subs.
On hearing that Coe-Li stickers were distributed on pizza boxes last Saturday night, Coe-Odess punched the air and hissed a triumphant schoolboy’s “Yes!”
“That’s the best thing that’s happened on my campaign,” he exclaims. Whether he says the same on election day is yet to be seen.

Senan Ebrahim ’12 likens his partnership with his vice-presidential pick, Bonnie Cao ’12, to a “UC wedding.” This union seeks to produce a Forum for Change at Harvard, a new social space, and a more flexible Winter Break as its offspring. However, in a year when all major tickets recognize social space and student life as the most important issues, friends say that Ebrahim and Cao’s likable personalities and experience on the Undergraduate Council will be the extra push to set them apart from the rest.
THE DUO
“I’d describe us as Frog and Toad,” Ebrahim says, referring to the main characters in Arnold S. Lobel’s children books. “We just complement each other really well.”
Ebrahim and Cao share a rare chemistry that perhaps springs from the myriad similarities between them, including the lack of a middle name, their Californian and immigrant backgrounds, and a love for the Russian language and Berryline.
Not coincidentally, both are UC veterans, having enjoyed meteoric rises to the Executive Board while amassing a slew of popular initiatives under their belts. Ebrahim was the mastermind behind UCRooms.org, which allows students to search for and reserve common spaces on campus. Cao was responsible for the expansion of Student Initiated Programming and UC TKTS, a popular lottery program for students that provides free tickets to events in the greater Boston area.
Beyond a commitment to improving social life at Harvard, Ebrahim and Cao say they hope to forge a more tight-knit community within the UC itself. “It’ll be really cool if the UC becomes less of a bureaucratic organization and more of a student group,” Cao says.
SENAN
Born and raised in San Jose, Calif., Ebrahim radiates a quality that is quintessentially Californian. He was inspired to join the UC before even registering for his first classes. Working for Dorm Crew the summer before freshman year, he met Matthew L. Sundquist ‘09, the former UC President. The notion of joining an organization that promised to make Harvard a better place piqued his interest. “Even in an institution as awesome as this, making a real change happen for students still sounded really cool,” Ebrahim says.
Because of that promise, Ebrahim has served on the UC for three years, sticking with it through election controversies and the occasional frustrations regarding inefficiency and bureaucratic red tape. He quickly ascended through the ranks, becoming Chair of the Student Life Committee in the fall of his sophomore year.
“I don’t know anyone who doesn’t like Senan,” says Kwang Y. “Joseph” Kim ’12, who was Ebrahim’s superior as Chair of the Education Committee and now serves as the Ebrahim-Cao campaign manager. “On the UC, out of the 12 freshman reps, eight are with us and one is with the other side,” Kim explains. “Senan is able to draw in new people and bring them together, and that’s what makes him a real leader.”
Aside from the UC, Ebrahim is involved with Engineers Without Borders and the Undergraduate Research Association; he also conducts neurobiology research at Massachusetts General Hospital. He was, however, declined membership from the Association of Black Harvard Women and the Delta Gamma sorority, which he still regrets until this day. “Apparently I’m not as special as George Banta,” Ebrahim says, referring to the only man ever initiated into the women’s fraternity.
Ebrahim is a science geek at heart, according to his running mate. “He’s a mega-nerd,” Cao says. “He’ll wear t-shirts that say ‘Got Research?’ and stuff like that.”
Beyond Harvard, Ebrahim has his eyes on medical school, shunning the “dirty” world of politics. “This is the last thing I’m going to run for,” he says. “I just want to do something rewarding, and to be able to go to sleep feeling like I’ve done something good that day.”
According to his former roommate and “BFF” Samuel A. Brotherton ’12, Ebrahim’s lack of political ambitions will prove favorable for the candidate in this election. “He doesn’t see it as the beginning of a political career. He’s in it simply because he wants to do his part to make Harvard a better place.”
BONNIE
The first thing most people notice about Bonnie Cao is her smile. “She always brings out the positive energy, and she’s always smiling,” Ebrahim says of his running mate. Like Ebrahim, Cao hails from California and considers herself a die-hard L.A. Lakers fan, even if that means dodging rowdy Bostonians and hiding her jersey at every Lakers-Celtics basketball game.
Encouraged by Andrea R. Flores ’10, another former UC President, Cao joined the UC during the fall of her sophomore year as the Pforzheimer House representative. She joined the Student Life Committee under Ebrahim’s leadership, and found in him the big brother figure that she says she’s always wanted. “Senan is such a teddy bear,” she says. “When I was going through some tough family stuff, he was the person that I talked to.”
Cao, who was approached by several people over the summer as a potential UC vice presidential candidate, picked Ebrahim because of a simple logic. “It was the question of who I would vote for, and it’s pretty clearly Senan,” she explains. When she’s not perusing Ticketmaster for events that would be attractive to Harvard students for UC TKTS or fulfilling her role as UC Secretary, Cao serves as a board member of the Chinese Student Association and a member of the Delta Gamma sorority.
After college, Cao hopes to spend some time in a consulting firm, and eventually use that experience to work for a non-profit organization or an NGO. She had her eyes on politics, but quickly grew disillusioned with its inefficiency. “The more I learn about American politics, the more frustrated I become because it doesn’t necessarily get what needs to be done, done,” she says.
And like Ebrahim, Cao’s roommate sings her praises. “The best thing about Bonnie is that she cares,” said Leslie A. Rea ’12, Cao’s current roommate. “When I’m sick or upset about something, she’ll come talk to me. When I miss a meal, she’ll bring me food. She wants people to be happy.”

Grover G. Norquist '78, president of Americans for Tax Reform, which aims to reduce government spending, is an economist and self-proclaimed “tax guy.” Norquist spoke with FM about the development of his political views, his thoughts on the modern Republican Party, and his take on the United States’ current economic challenges.
1. Fifteen Minutes: What were the inspirations for your early political views?
Grover G. Norquist: I was an anti-communist before I was political in other ways. I read a great deal about the Soviet Union—my public library decided to get rid of all its ‘annoying’ books, which meant all of the right-of-center books, and sold them all off for a nickel or a dime or a quarter. I picked up “I Led Three Lives,” by Herb Philbrick, the guy who was a spy inside the communist party. So I was an anti-communist first, and then over time became active in the Republican Party, and then broadened my interest set into market economics and, in college, I knew I was a free market person.
2. FM: So what led you to adopt the political views you currently hold?
GGN: Common sense and history. You look at those countries and parts of the world that had low taxes and less regulation and freedom of movement. Carthage—I mean all the great countries when they were great were open to immigration, open to new ideas, open to freedom, more open economically. And as countries have too much government and too much government control, they stagnate. If you look around, East Germany is less nice than West Germany, and North Korea is less pleasant than South Korea.
3. FM: Ideally, what should be the role of government?
GGN: Government should enforce rule of law. It should enforce contracts, it should protect people bodily from being attacked by criminals. And when the government does those things, it is facilitating liberty. When it goes beyond those things, it becomes destructive to both human happiness and human liberty.
4. FM: You are known for saying that you want government to be “the size where we can drown it in the bathtub.” Can you elaborate on this?
GGN: I want to drop the government in half over the next 25 years, and then drop it in half again. The government’s about 33 percent of GDP, 33 percent of the economy. We want to take it down to 16 and a half percent, then take it down to eight percent, all of which would take us to where we were at the turn of the century.
5. FM: Do you think this is something that the United States can realistically achieve?
GGN: Yeah, I think we can. We were on a trajectory during the six years of a Republican Congress, even with Clinton fighting against it. If we had kept on that path for fifteen years straight ahead, we would have dropped the size of the federal government by 40 percent, as a percentage of the economy. The economy was growing and we were holding the growth of government down. Bush turned around and spent too much, and Obama turned around and said, ‘All those stupid things Bush is doing, we’re going to do 10 times that much.’ So he did stupid on steroids.
6. FM: What’s your position on the 16th Amendment, which provides the federal government the ability to leverage an income tax?
GGN: The country and the economy would have been better off if they hadn’t put it in. It was put in on the promise that it would only hit a few people and of course now it hits almost everybody. So it was probably not the wisest thing that Congress ever did.
7. FM: If not by raising taxes, what do you think is the best way for the country to begin to reduce the over 13 trillion dollar deficit?
GGN: What’s hurting the US economy is total government spending. The deficit is an indicator that the government is spending so much money that it can’t even get around to stealing all of the money that it wants to spend. But the tip of the iceberg is not what hit the Titanic—it was the 90 percent of the iceberg under water. So step one: stop spending so much. It’s hysterical to listen to people in Washington D.C.—‘We’ve got to figure out how to deal with this spending problem.’ It’s like somebody who’s trying to lose weight who really wants to lose weight but doesn’t want to exercise or diet. Obama would really like to reduce—well, he doesn’t even say he wants to reduce government spending. He misdirects you to the deficit and says, ‘We’d like to fix the deficit.’ No exercise, no diet.
8. FM: How would you have proposed to deal with the latest recession if it wasn’t for the stimulus package?
GGN: The stimulus package only made things worse. Ever since the stimulus package, unemployment has gone up, growth has been slower. The Keynesian economic theory runs as follows: a government’s going to take a dollar from somebody who earned it and give a dollar to somebody who didn’t earn it and we’re all going to be richer, and we’re going to do this 800 billion times. After you do that 800 billion times, you have in fact taken money from people who earned it and given it to people who are politically connected, but how in the world do you believe that that leads to economic growth?
9. FM: What would have been the consequences if, say, AIG had not received any stimulus?
GGN: Well, to the extent that there were real assets there, they would be redeployed into the economy in real ways, and the people who had made those decisions would probably be out of work. But we also need to go to pro-growth policies. We should have zero capital gains tax. We should abolish the death tax. We have a corporate tax rate of 35 percent, when the average in Europe is 25 percent. We ought to at least take our corporate tax rate to 25 percent. Our personal tax rate, now at 35 percent, should go to 25 percent. Serfs in medieval Europe were taxed 20 to 25 percent. I don’t think we should be taxed higher than serfs.
10. FM: In 1915, the richest one percent of Americans possessed 18 percent of the nation’s income. It was around this time that Congress passed the 16th Amendment, which was an effort to even out the wealth disparities at the time. Today, the richest one percent of Americans take home 24 percent of the nation’s income. Do you view this wealth inequality as problematic?
GGN: No, because it’s not any of the government’s business who earns what, as long as they earn it legitimately. The problem that Robin Hood had with the Sheriff of Nottingham was the Sheriff of Nottingham used the power of taxation to steal all his money. It wasn’t that the Sheriff was rich: the Sheriff was the government and all the money he had was stolen. The government ought not to be in the business of making some people rich at the expense of others.
11. FM: So you believe that there should be no wealth redistribution?
GGN: No forced wealth redistribution. I’m all in favor of, you know, rich people wanting to contribute money to somebody else. One of the things that’s interesting is none of the rich liberals actually believes in government. Warren Buffett, who says he’s a big liberal who liked Obama, he has millions of dollars. If he thought any of the United States government spent money better than he does, he could make a contribution to the federal government. And he never does. He gives all his money to private charities, because he thinks he can spend his money better than the government can, but he wants everybody else to have higher taxes because he thinks the government can spend your money better than you can. This is not an endorsement of government. It’s an expression of contempt for you.
12. FM: What’s your view on the Tea Party movement?
GGN: Tremendous asset.
13. FM: Would you call any current Republican politicians too conservative?
GGN: Too conservative in the sense of not wanting to be radical enough? Sure. There are some who are dragging their feet in wanting to oppose spending.  Too conservative meaning their vision of limited government has the government too teeny? I can’t think of any.
14. FM: Are there any moderate Republicans left?
GGN: I’m a moderate Republican. There are people who are extremes on either side of me, but I pretty much define a reasonable position on these things.
15. FM: Who would you support for Republican Presidential nomination in 2012?
GGN: The person who wins the nomination. I don’t have a favorite. Somebody who won’t raise taxes or steal my guns or occupy any number of foreign countries.

Romanian Member of the European Parliament Monica Macovei urged the European Union to adopt standardized  anti-corruption laws and enforce their implementation within each EU country, during a talk yesterday at the Harvard Kennedy School.
Macovei—credited with anti-corruption efforts that enabled Romania’s accession to the EU in 2007—expressed concern about high levels of corruption in both Romania and Bulgaria, home to widespread fraud, corruption, and organized crime.
But, she said, the problem is not limited to new member states.
Throughout Europe, 56 billion euros are lost each year to health care fraud and corruption, she said.
Macovei argued, during the talk to about 30 undergraduates from area colleges, that corruption in the EU is still seen as a national matter.
“[Currently] there is no EU policy for anti-corruption on the EU level,” she said. “Anti-corruption is only a requirement for candidate countries.”
She argued that Romania had set up the necessary anti-corruption legislation to join the EU, but that enforcement efforts had not been effective.
While anti-corruption legislation is overseen by an international organization called the Group of States Against Corruption, the group does not look at policy implementation and is ineffective, said Macovei, a former justice minister.
Macovei said corruption is a pressing concern throughout Europe and not just in Romania.
She cited a Eurobarometer survey, conducted for the European Commission, which revealed that 78 percent of Europeans regard corruption as a major problem in their country.
“We need to respond to people’s concerns and people’s requests regarding corruption,” she said.
Besides improving anti-corruption efforts, Macovei called for standardizing how different institutions within Europe measure corruption, which would better allow for comparison among countries.
She said improved anti-corruption efforts would not extend beyond the EU’s legal purview, outlined in the Lisbon Treaty.
Aware that she was speaking in the United States, she argued that European corruption should also be a concern in America.
Corruption in the EU could hurt trade relations with the U.S., potentially raising prices, she said.
One member of the audience said he found the talk informative.
“Previously I was unaware of the absence of pan-European anti-corruption laws and I think the EU should make that a priority,” Patrick J. Leonard ’14 said.

Harvard University will “fully and formally” recognize the long-banned Reserve Officer Training Corps program upon the repeal of “don’t ask, don’t tell,” University President Drew G. Faust said yesterday at the Institute of Politics.
In an introduction for Adm. Mike Mullen—the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff—Faust made her strongest comments to date against the policy, which bans gays and lesbians from openly serving in the military. Faust has previously conditioned ROTC’s return to Harvard upon the policy’s repeal, but yesterday marks the first time that she has explicitly said that her administration would welcome ROTC back to Harvard’s campus.
“As a further embodiment of that tradition [of service], a ROTC program open to all ought to be fully and formally present on our campus,” Faust said to a ringing round of applause.
Mullen, who was the primary speaker at yesterday’s event, has forcefully said that he personally believes “don’t ask, don’t tell” ought to be repealed. He said he thinks it is “incredibly important” to have ROTC units at institutions like Harvard, adding that the policy’s repeal is up to Congress.
In her remarks, Faust spoke in precise terms about the program’s return to Harvard and cast military service as part of the University’s broader mission of serving the public interest.
“I want to be the president of Harvard who sees the end of ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’ because I want to be able to take the steps to ensure that any and every Harvard student can make the honorable and admirable choice to commit him or herself to our nation’s defense,” she said to an audience of ROTC cadets and large numbers of members of the armed forces and veterans.
Mullen did not address “don’t ask, don’t tell” during his prepared remarks but said in response to a question from Harvard Kennedy School professor David R. Gergen that he would do everything in his power to bring a ROTC unit to Harvard.
Currently, Harvard’s ROTC students regularly commute to MIT for physical training and classes. The program left Harvard in 1969 over discontent surrounding the Vietnam War.
But Harvard’s at times fractious relationship with the military has in recent years been driven by what the University says is the Pentagon’s discriminatory policy toward gays and lesbians.
Gergen, an adviser in the Clinton White House during the enactment of “don’t ask, don’t tell,” said in an interview that all the individuals who had played an intimate role in crafting the policy—himself included—had since changed their opinion of it and now favor its repeal.
Mullen’s lecture shied away from the debate over that policy and, instead, addressed the need for a flexible military strategy during times of war.
Citing examples from the American Civil War, the Korean War, and the Cuban Missile Crisis, Mullen argued that civilian policymakers must skeptically evaluate the advice of their military commanders and entertain the possibility of altering their military plans mid-way through a conflict.
Mullen added that a critical part of any military intervention in today’s world was the post-conflict process of economic and political development.
“It’s got to get to a point that young men and women... have a better path than putting on a suicide vest,” he said.

The playing of vuvuzelas—those slender plastic horns that generated a buzz at the World Cup this summer—will not be allowed at the 127th football game between Harvard and Yale.
The Department of Athletics had previously said it intended to deal with the horns, which create a potentially disturbing noise, on a case-by-case basis at Saturday’s game.
“In keeping with Department of Athletics’ commitment to conduct athletic contests in a manner that promotes good sportsmanship, artificial noisemakers will not be permitted inside the ticketed footprint of Harvard Stadium,” wrote Associate Director of Athletics Timothy W. Wheaton in a statement on Tuesday.
The Undergraduate Council recently passed legislation recommending the ban to the Department of Athletics.
Oak Yard Representative Spenser R. Goodman ’14 introduced the vote after talking to Harvard’s football players and members of the band about the possibility of vuvuzelas being played at The Game.
“If you’re on offense, you can’t hear your own team,” Goodman said. “And the band members prepare for this game for a long time.”
Vuvuzelas create 127 decibels of sound, which is louder than a chainsaw, according to the BBC.
Dunster House UC Representative Annemette H. Harnes ’12 cited further problems with the vuvuzelas.
“There are going to be a lot of alums at The Game, and it would tarnish their experience,” Harnes said.
“Also, people might leave them, and it would be just another thing that would have to be cleaned up afterward.”
The Silence Yale Campaign, a movement for Harvard fans to play vuvuzelas at The Game, was initiated in October by Eric M. Cervini ’14  and Johnathon H. Davis ’14.
“We are disappointed by the sudden change in policy, and we hope that the Athletics Department will follow NCAA guidelines that permit the sensible use of artificial noisemakers during football games,” Cervini wrote in an e-mail.
Harvard’s football players will likely be glad about the ban, said Harvard tight end Nicolai F. Schwarzkopf ’11. “We definitely have other parts of the game that people want to hear besides a loud unbearable humming,” Schwarzkopf said. “You wouldn’t be able to hear the cheerleaders, the band. And there’s always Harvard chants, Yale chants—they’re all a part of The Game.”
Schwarzkopf also believes that the blare of the vuvuzelas would have had an effect on the performance of Harvard’s players.
“When the noise level increases, it makes it harder to hear plays and calls from other players on your team,” Schwarzkopf added. “We practice to overcome that noise. But the specific noise from these instruments shouldn’t be a part of the overall crowd noise. It’ll get loud enough without them, believe me.”

Michelle A. Rhee, former chancellor of the District of Columbia public schools, engaged with a packed auditorium last night, fielding questions, reflecting on her personal life, and elaborating on her polarizing views on education in urban America.
Rhee—who received a master’s of public policy from the Harvard Kennedy School in 1997—shared her experiences with a struggling school system and discussed the leadership tactics she used to make changes in the D.C. schools, during a talk at the Harvard Graduate School of Education.
Telling anecdotes that mustered hearty laughs from her audience, Rhee recounted her foray into the superintendent’s role three years ago. At the time, there was nothing that she would have liked to do less than be an urban superintendent, she said.
Rhee, who was 37 when she became chancellor, started the job facing skepticism from the community. Many called her too young and inexperienced, she recounted.
But Rhee made sweeping changes, closing more than 20 schools in the district within the first year of her tenure.
“If we’re going to change education in America, it has to revolve around educator quality,” Rhee said last night.
Rhee outlined her methodology for bringing change to a school district in which only 8 percent of eighth graders were performing at grade level—a statistic that she described as “criminal.”
Rhee brought in “the best talent” and dismissed those who did not meet the standards she set.
“I’m a total softie for kids,” said Rhee, who has two daughters of her own. “When kids are getting screwed, it pisses me off, and that’s what drives me.”
During the question-and-answer section at the event last night, Rhee argued that education in the United States should put effective teachers before qualified ones.
Rhee resigned from the school system last month.
“In 10 years, I’m going to be 50 years old. That’s terrifying,” she said.
“At the end of the day, nothing has changed. That doesn’t work for me...We wanted to see a transformation.”
Rhee was recently featured in the controversial documentary “Waiting For ‘Superman.’”

Public policy professor Jack A. Goldstone ’76 sought to convey that “opening our doors to immigrants is not only desirable, but an absolute necessity,” at an event yesterday at the Harvard Kennedy School.
“I’m stunned that when our economy is in trouble so many Americans are turning against what has been one of the motors of American growth,” said Goldstone, who is director of the Center for Global Policy at George Mason University.
Goldstone devoted much of his lecture to dispelling myths about the negative impacts of migration on wages and the economy. He presented data that both legal and illegal immigration declined during the recent recession.
Goldstone believes immigration is vital to sustaining the economy. The baby boomers especially require labor-intensive health care services as they age, partially driving the demand for new migration.
One of the most common misconceptions, Goldstone said, is the impact of immigrants on the availability of American jobs. “It doesn’t matter who is living next door to you, If you have skills that are good, you’ll do fine.” The real factors, Goldstone said, are the decline in unionization, competition with foreign companies and lack of training opportunities.
While discrimination against immigrants in the U.S. is not as intense as in Europe, he said, there is still a profound amount of fear. “A lot of the so-called facts that are used to frighten people about migration are simply not true,” he said, noting that there are “real problems absorbing immigrants into democracies.”
This is due in part to the common view of “American citizenship as a consumer good,” in which admitting new members into society is seen as violating a mutual trust, Goldstone said.
During the lecture, which was part of the Kennedy School’s Democracy Seminar Series, he also mentioned that the perpetuation of such misconceptions is driven by both fear and “elite” interests.
“The persistent communication of these non-facts in large-scale media and by politicians on the air suggest to me that it is more than just cranky individuals.”
Goldstone will give 19 lectures this fall and early winter on the topic of immigration across the globe, including places as diverse as Helsinki, Rhodes, Venice and Brussels.
“I believe that democracy belongs to everybody,” Goldstone said, commenting on his motivations for his work.
“America’s great strength and success have come from an open society, and we have benefited from letting anyone who wants to succeed use their talents in this country. We need to make our laws support those ambitions and not frustrate them.”

Local police forces arrested two individuals this week, one in connection with Tuesday’s theft outside the Harvard Square T Station and the other in connection with last week’s armed robbery in Harvard Yard.
A suspect in the Yard robbery—in which a man unaffiliated with the University was robbed at gunpoint outside of Thayer Hall on Nov. 11—will be arraigned today, according to an e-mailed message from the chief of the Harvard University Police Department, Francis “Bud” Riley, sent to the Harvard community by Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds.
Additionally, Fernando Martinez was arrested on Tuesday for a robbery he allegedly committed at 5:20 that morning, according to the Cambridge Police Department log. After a brief chase and struggle, police arrested Martinez and charged him with robbery, disorderly conduct, and resisting arrest.
The police department log reports that three men approached a Boston resident by the corner of Massachusetts Avenue and Brattle Street at 5:21 that morning and demanded that he give them his cell phone and money.
Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds e-mailed Riley’s statement to students in the College yesterday afternoon.
Prior to Tuesday’s report and arrest, six robberies were reported on or near Harvard’s campus in the past three weeks.
In his message regarding the Yard robbery, Riley suggested using only “well-lit or Designated Pathways,” as well as taking advantage of the services provided by HUPD. These services provided by HUPD. These services include shuttle buses, escort vans, and the Harvard University Campus Escort Program.
Additionally, Riley recommended that students be aware of the location of blue light phones and be sure to use them in case of emergency.
In the message preceding Riley’s advice, Hammonds also cautioned against “piggybacking”—permitting individuals who do not swipe an ID card to enter a dorm behind someone with swipe access.
Hammonds wrote, “I ask you to be mindful of your peers and to take care of one another within the College and larger Harvard community.”
The Cambridge Police Department did not respond to requests for comment.

As a slideshow with pictures of flood damage in Pakistan played in the background, Harvard Law students dined on not only Thanksgiving fare—turkey, sweet potatoes, and green beans—but also on mozzarella sticks, quesadillas, and buffalo wings at the second annual “Thanksgiving Dinner for a Cause” last night.
The event, which raised more than $5,000, was put on by the Harvard Law School Student Government to raise money for flood relief in Pakistan.
Five hundred tickets at $10 each were sold for the dinner at Pound Hall, with 100 percent of proceeds going toward the effort, said Jennifer D. Dein, a third-year law school student and president of the HLS Student Government. The dinner was advertised mostly to law school students, Dein said, but professors and other graduate students also attended.
The price of a ticket included an all-you-can-eat dinner and open bar. Local establishments Tommy Doyle’s, When Pigs Fly, Crema Cafe, Wagamama, Trader Joe’s, and Pinocchio’s Pizza & Subs donated food for the dinner, and Finale Desserterie & Bakery donated cakes for dessert.
“We basically went door-to-door to restaurants, brought information about the event, brought the tax-deduction, and pleaded with them and called them until they were willing to donate,” Dein said.
Ellen M. Cosgrove, HLS associate dean and dean of students, supplied pies, which she and her staff served, and the rest of the food was bought by the Student Government from the caterer Restaurant Associates.
“I was a little surprised by some of the food,” said Karen R. Boutros, a third-year law school student. “I was expecting  more of a traditional Thanksgiving dinner, which does not typically include buffalo wings. But this is very nice.”
As well, for a dollar per ticket, attendees could enter a raffle for a chance to win a $500 gift card to a bar exam preparation course as well as gift cards to local eateries, with all proceeds going to the flood relief.
Last year’s event raised money for troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. This year, HLS students got to vote on the cause they wanted the dinner to support.
Last year the dinner ran out of food, so this year the Director of Student Engagement for the Student Government Lina Jun said the group planned ahead by having servers at the buffet instead of self-serve buffets as was the case last year.
“I think it was a really great event,” said second-year law school student Stephen W. Henrick. “It was for a very good cause, they had a lot of good food, and we all get to get together like this. It’s nice to have a little Thanksgiving dinner.”

For the first time this year students in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences were required to fill out a pre-term planning tool—which indicates their tentative and non-binding course preferences for the next semester—but some undergraduates criticized the tool and its value.
Administrators say the new process will help them better predict course enrollment numbers for the upcoming semester, providing the College with guidance in hiring teaching fellows, assigning classrooms, and ordering course materials.
But some undergraduates said they found the online tool difficult to use.
“Looking for courses and navigating all the tabs was pretty confusing. I was too lazy to watch the tutorial video,” said Yue Meng ’14.
Administrators said they had received some criticism about the process and planned to make some changes.
“We are going to evaluate the feedback that we’ve received thus far and will get some groups of students together to work with us to improve it,” Stephanie H. Kenen, associate dean of undergraduate education, wrote in an e-mail statement.
Yesterday was the deadline for freshmen and sophomores to fill out their class preferences. Juniors and seniors have already submitted their tentative schedules.
As of yesterday the College had received more than 6,000 pre-term planning submissions.
The College introduced the plan in September as a non-binding means for students to indicate which courses they plan to take in the spring.
But the new policy caught some students off guard.
Some criticized what they perceived to be the counter-intuitive layout of the tool.
“It took me 10 minutes, and I watched the tutorial; however, I couldn’t help thinking that if pre-term planning requires a tutorial, then it should be simplified,” said Alex B. Stein ’14.
Others found the process relatively painless, thanks to the help of the tutorial videos on the Registar’s website.
“It was really easy and took a lot less time than other people made it out to be. The tutorial was really useful, and the whole process only took about three minutes: I did it on the way to dinner,” said Sandy U. Uwimana ’14.
Beyond the technical aspects of pre-term planning, students offered opinions as to whether they thought the new system would benefit them.
“I guess it forces you to think ahead, but I think it’s kind of useless. For instance, it’s not really that useful if you’re in the sciences. I know what I’m taking all year,” said David Shuster ’13.
While sympathetic to the mission of the Registrar’s Office, Peter D. McCarthy ’12  said, “The course selection tool made it really difficult to rearrange courses from your plan of study, and I think that because of that, the results that the office collects won’t necessarily reflect what people plan on taking.”

A panel of experienced lawyers assured law students that being gay does not need to be a barrier to workplace success at an event yesterday at Harvard Law School.
The discussion was designed to address the concerns of gay law students entering the current job market.
The panelists were members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community.
Mark A. Weber, assistant dean for Harvard Law School Career Services, said that when he graduated from law school, the work environment was entirely different.
“You didn’t have ‘Will & Grace’; you didn’t have ‘Glee,’” said Weber, who moderated the event.
“We’re in a whole different world than we were 10, 15 years ago.”
MJ Edwards, a counsel at WilmerHale, advised students not to put concerns about diversity above the quality of a firm when choosing a place to work. Citing her own experience, Edwards said that ultimately she joined a firm that had a “well-roundedness” that spoke to her.
Lisa Lofdahl, a lawyer at Sullivan & Cromwell, urged students to keep sexuality in perspective, as one piece of a greater whole. “Don’t think it needs to overshadow all of the rest of who you are,” she said.
All members of the panel said that at their progressively minded law firms, discrimination in the workplace has never been a barrier to their success.
Instead, said Sarah Boonin, an assistant clinical professor of law at Suffolk University Law School, the issues she faces are less consequential, such as a common assumption that she only wants to work on LGBT issues.
Lofdahl, who helps with her firm’s recruitment process for new lawyers, said that being gay “does nothing but help in your favor,” because hiring gay employees helps firms like Lofdahl’s to reach their diversity goals.
Though the panelists were generally optimistic, they acknowledged that discrimination does exist.
Boonin advised that to make the biggest change in the workplace, students should “be professional allies” of other minority groups.
By doing so, she said, a person can “contribute to an overall feeling of diversity.”
The event was sponsored by the Harvard Office of Career Services, LAMBDA and the Massachusetts LGBTQ Bar Association.

Students from across Boston came together to discuss cultural insensitivity at an event hosted by Fuerza Latina in Tsai Auditorium last night.
The discussion was prompted by recent events on several university campuses, said Pamela M. Rosario Perez ’13, social chair of Fuerza Latina.
Some of the most salient triggers have been on Harvard’s campus. They include the controversy surrounding the Social Studies fund in honor of Marty Peretz—who posted derogatory comments about Muslims online before offering a public apology—and a party at Sigma Chi called “Conquistabros and Navajos,” Rosario Perez said.
“We wanted to open space for people to discuss this,” Rosario Perez said.
A panel composed of English and African American Studies professor Glenda R. Carpio, research associate at the Harvard Kennedy School Elliott Prasse-Freeman ’03, and president of Boston University’s Cape Verdean Student Association Carlene R. Ferreira began the dialogue with the question of how to be culturally sensitive without being overly cautious.
The members of the panel offered their personal definitions of cultural insensitivity but ultimately suggested that developing strategies to effectively and gracefully confront the issue was as important as defining the terms of discussion.
After the panel concluded, the audience took part in smaller breakout discussions with the panelists.
Nima Y. Hassan ’14 said that as a Muslim student, she found the event “valuable because it was talking about advocacy not just in terms of racial or religious or cultural minorities but also in terms of engaging the majority culture.”
Rosario Perez said she also was encouraged by the event. “We had students from different races and other backgrounds,” said Rosario Perez of the group that gathered. She added, “I’m happy with the fact that people were speaking out.”
The event—named Under Our Skin—was organized through a collaborative effort between student leaders of Harvard’s Fuerza Latina, BU’s Cape Verdean Student Association and Alianza Latina, and other collegiate cultural groups in Boston.
Joshua Hernandez ’14, a freshman representative of Fuerza Latina, said that while he felt that the event was worthwhile, future gatherings should have a broader focus. “It’s important to address privilege and disadvantage while not feeling trapped in your own disadvantage and not having that define your mind-set.”

A year after scandal and accusations marred the 2009 Undergraduate Council presidential elections, Senan Ebrahim ’12 and running mate Bonnie Cao ’12 were elected to lead the UC on Thursday, ending a relatively quiet race marked by a face-off between two insider tickets with strong histories of leadership on the Council.
Cao and Ebrahim were given first-place votes on 45 percent of the 3,595 ballots filed, and achieved a majority when the votes of the third-place ticket, Collin A. Jones ’12 and Peter D. Davis ’12, were re-allotted according to the Council’s Hare-Clark voting system.
The second-place ticket of Matthew S. Coe-Odess ’12 and Tengbo Li ’12 trailed this year’s victors by a margin of 567 votes in the final tabulation. The election saw a turnout on par with the balloting in 2009 and 2008, which recorded poll numbers of 3,792 and 3,642 respectively after registering an all-time low in 2007.
Over the course of the two-week campaign, the momentum swung largely toward the Ebrahim-Cao camp, which captured the endorsements of 24 student groups—including the Chinese Students Association, Fuerza Latina, Queer Students and Allies, and the Harvard College Democrats, a traditional bellwether that had endorsed the winning candidate in each of the previous seven years.
By contrast, Coe-Odess and Li won the approval of six smaller student groups and Pinocchio’s Pizza & Subs.
Ebrahim and Cao also gained the support of the majority of the freshman UC representatives prior to the election. The freshman vote was a focus of the campaign, according to Cao, who indicated that freshmen were expected to vote in greater numbers than upperclassmen.
Earlier this week, Cao indicated that eight of the 12 freshmen on the Council had thrown their weight behind the Ebrahim-Cao ticket.
Social life remained the main focus of all three campaigns and dominated the two public debates this year. Both Ebrahim and Coe-Odess have touted their experience working on the issue—Ebrahim as Student Life Committee Chair and Coe-Odess as the Social Life Task Force Chair—and offered similar solutions, including increased use of House common spaces and school-wide social events.
But student group leaders pointed to the realistic promises on the Ebrahim-Cao platform—including an expansion of the UC’s recent pilot program to help student groups rent out large or off-campus venues and further work on inter-House dining—as a major reason for their endorsement.
Ebrahim and Cao have similarly focused on the expansion and revamping of existing initiatives, promising to work on Optional Winter Activities Week programming for the College’s January break between semesters and to improve campus applications such as Shuttleboy, which tracks campus shuttle buses.
“I feel like both tickets propose a lot of the same things. That’s probably because both tickets are UC insiders,” said Kwang “Joseph” Y. Kim ’12, Ebrahim-Cao’s campaign manager. “They’ve already been working on projects that they know are feasible and they can deliver once they get into office.”
The feasibility of some of Ebrahim-Cao’s other promises remains to be seen. Largely unprecedented projects include the recognition of campus Greek life, extension of the deadline for changing course registration to pass-fail, and a shopping week that would allow students to scout different teaching fellows before finalizing their section assignments.
Throughout the campaign, Ebrahim and Cao pegged as their most innovative initiative their proposed “Forum for Change,” a new program that would bring together student activists with administrators and faculty members close to their area of concern. In interviews over the past two weeks, Ebrahim pointed to the Forum initiative as an example of his ability to capitalize on the strength of his existing relationship with key College administrators, who he said have shown support for the Forum.
Both the Coe-Li and Jones-Davis tickets offered congratulations to Ebrahim and Cao last night, expressing their faith in the pair’s ability to lead the Council in the coming year.
“We said we had a 40-60 chance and it was 42-58,” Coe-Odess said. “We started two years behind them. We got a late start, had a smaller staff. I think the stronger ticket won, and we’re holding our heads high.”
The election season had a muted feel in the wake of the chaos surrounding the end of last year’s race, during which Election Commissioners voted to de-certify the results of the election after allegations surfaced that then-candidate and current UC Vice President Eric N. Hysen ’11 had access to voting software during the balloting process.
Hysen and current UC president Johnny F. Bowman ’11, who won last year’s tumultuous contest by a margin of less than 50 votes, have remained close-mouthed during this year’s campaigning season, stressing the equality of the two leading tickets and refraining from issuing an endorsement.
With 748 first-place tallies in the initial round of voting, outsider candidates Jones and Davis, who ran a campaign founded on humor, raked in nearly 21 percent of the ballots. Last year, in a race also featuring three tickets, outsiders and last-place finishers Robert G.B. Long ’11 and David R. Johnson ’11 received 17 percent of the first place votes.
The Election Commission, charged with overseeing the UC campaigning and voting process and ensuring compliance with Council by-laws, witnessed no major controversies during this year’s cycle. The Council adopted legislation following last year’s tumultuous election to reduce the number of Election Commissioners from 7 to 5 and reform the access to the online voting software.
“We have nonetheless been cognizant of our role and reputation in light of the issues that plagued the last election,” Election Commission Chair Cort A. VanOstran ’12 wrote in an e-mail. “This year’s election has gone off without a hitch.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite a disappointing 2010 season, some members of the Harvard men’s soccer team do have something to be proud of this year.
Sophomore midfielder Scott Prozeller, sophomore forward Brian Rogers, and senior co-captain Robert Millock were named to the All-Ivy League Second Team yesterday, while junior goalie Austin Harms garnered an All-Ivy honorable mention.
“I was certainly excited,” Prozeller said. “I try to become the best player I can so it’s always great to be recognized for your performance. But this season I think I take it more with a grain of salt because we had such high expectations...The team not doing so well kind of diminishes the glory of any individual recognition.”
Prozeller ranked second on the squad with three goals and seven points. He scored the game-winning goal against Yale on Oct. 3rd.
After winning Ivy League Rookie of the Year last season, Rogers made the All-Ivy Second Team for a second consecutive time, despite missing two games due to injury. The forward emerged as Harvard’s leading scorer with five goals (fifth in the Ancient Eight) and 11 points this season. In the process, Rogers often had a flair for the dramatic, scoring the game-winning goal in the 80th minute of the season opener against Stanford while netting a game-tying score in the 90th minute against Stony Brook. He was also tabbed to ESPN The Magazine’s All-District Second Team.
Millock was a leader of a Crimson defense that allowed 1.09 goals per game, good for fifth in the Ancient Eight. He started all 17 games for Harvard in his final season.
Harms made 13 starts in goal for the Crimson, posting a 3-6-4 record. He finished fourth in the Ivy in saves per game (3.62) and fifth in save percentage (.746) while earning three shutouts.
“The individual honors are only made possible by the rest of the team,” Prozeller said. “I think when we were successful, it wasn’t about individual players but a team effort.”
Harvard finished the season 5-7-5 and 2-3-2 in the conference. Junior forward Antoine Hoppenot of league-champion Princeton took home Ivy Player of the Year hardware (won last year by Andre Akpan ’10). Columbia midfielder Henning Sauerbier succeeded Rogers as the Ivy Rookie of the Year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While everyone’s mind is on The Game, other sporting events are still going on. Shocking. The Ivy League football title is still not totally secure, and four Ancient Eight soccer teams have qualified for the men’s NCAA tournament. Meanwhile, in cross country, there are still a couple of big races left, especially for Harvard’s stud runner. We’ve got a busy week ahead of us, as we’ll show you in a little trip around the water cooler.
As the Ivy League football season winds to a close, Penn has practically locked up the league title. All the Quakers have to do is beat Cornell this Saturday in Ithaca, and it should be a pretty easy victory. In fact, Penn has scored more than twice as many points as the Big Red while allowing over 100 points fewer.
Although another Ivy League football game a few hundred miles south might be getting a little more attention, Penn-Cornell has some history of its own. The two teams have faced off 116 times and have done so every year since 1919. The Quakers have held the upper hand from the start, winning the first game, 50-0, and taking 66 of the next 115 contests. It looks as if the tradition of Penn dominance will continue on Saturday.
But, if Cornell were to pull off a major upset, then the 127th matchup between Harvard and Yale would all of a sudden have Ancient Eight title implications. A Quaker loss combined with a Yale win would mean a split of the league crown between these two teams.
While there are still a few loose ends in Ivy League football, the book is closed on the women’s soccer season after league champion Penn lost in the first round of the NCAA tournament to Penn State. On the other hand, the men’s NCAA tournament is just getting started, and the Ancient Eight is well represented. In its best season since Bob Bradley—the coach of the U.S. men’s soccer team—was at the helm, Princeton won the Ivy League title, receiving a spot in soccer’s version of the Big Dance. Additionally, Brown, Penn, and Dartmouth all earned at-large bids. All four teams play their opening-round matches tomorrow.
Princeton also asserted its authority in the world of cross country.  In each of the nine NCAA regionals this past weekend, the top 25 finishers earned an All-Region honor. Princeton led the way for the Ancient Eight, tallying six such honors, while Cornell was second with four.
Though senior Dan Chenoweth was the only Harvard athlete to earn the All-Region accolade, he just might be the best runner in the Ivy League. After breaking the Harvard-Yale meet record earlier this year, Chenoweth has continued to have an excellent season, placing second at the Heptagonal Championships and most recently finishing third in the NCAA regionals. For his performance last weekend, Chenoweth will go to Indiana on Nov. 22 to compete in the NCAA cross country championships for the third year in a row, but not before he runs in this weekend’s IC4A/ECAC Championships in New York City.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During the 2009-10 Harvard men’s basketball season, only one Crimson player managed to record a double-double. Through just two games this season, two Crimson players have reached the milestone.
After co-captain Keith Wright finished with 22 points and 16 rebounds in Harvard’s season opener, sophomore Brandyn Curry followed suit in last night’s 72-49 win against Holy Cross.
In 36 minutes of play, Curry finished with a career-high 12 assists, 10 points, seven rebounds, and five steals.
“He makes a lot of plays,” co-captain Oliver McNally said. “When things break down, you’re going to need a playmaker, and that’s what Brandyn does really well for us.”
Curry recorded his career-high 10th assist with 12:05 left in the second half, finding Wright at the right elbow for an open jumper that the forward sank.
Curry’s final assist came late in the contest when the point guard came up with a loose ball at the top of the key and zipped a pass to classmate Christian Webster under the basket for the easy layup.
But despite Curry’s impressive offensive numbers, Harvard coach Tommy Amaker was most pleased with his impact on defense.
“It started a lot with Brandyn Curry,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I think his pressuring the ball and setting the tone up front for our defense really lifted our ball club.”
Curry wasted no time setting the tone defensively. On the Crusaders’ opening possession, Curry forced a five-second violation on Holy Cross guard R.J. Evans. Five minutes later Curry had already picked up two more steals, forcing another five-second call and picking the pocket of Crusader Dee Goens.
“My main focus tonight was defense from the beginning,” Curry said. “Coach always told me when you focus on defense, offense follows suit.”
HURRICANE HUGO
Harvard freshman Ugo Okam played just nine minutes in last night’s matchup, but the seven-footer made them count. Okam finished a perfect three-of-three from the field for six points, while adding three blocks and two rebounds.
Okam checked into the game with 14:17 left in the first half and immediately made his presence felt. On his first defensive possession, Okam recorded two blocks, deflecting a layup attempt from Goens and then swatting a shot from Andrew Beinart out to the perimeter.
Okam followed up on the offensive end, soaring into the air to catch and flush an alley-oop pass from Curry for his first collegiate basket.
“It’s nice having a seven-footer. You can just throw it up there,” Curry said. “Once I threw it, I knew no one else was getting to it.”
Okam followed with another flush for his second career basket, catching a pass deep in the post, and then finishing with a two-handed slam in traffic.
“I thought he gave us a great lift as soon as he got into the ball game,” Amaker said. “I think he’s going to become the crowd favorite.”
THE WRIGHT STUFF
After an outstanding performance in the Crimson’s opener, Wright turned in another solid effort last night, finishing with a team-high 18 points and six rebounds.
Wright did his most of his scoring around the basket but also displayed his extended range by knocking down a pair of jumpers from the elbow.
It looked like Wright was poised for a letdown performance after recording just two points in the first half. Missing his only shot from the field in the opening frame, Wright picked up two fouls in 33 seconds midway through the period and was relegated to the bench for the remainder of the half.
When Wright returned to the court to start the second half, he quickly turned his performance around.
The 6’8” forward recorded two blocks and notched 10 points by the 10-minute mark. Wright added four points before the final whistle to finish with a total of 18 points.
“I was really pleased with him,” Amaker said. “Sometime when kids miss a lot of minutes because of foul trouble...they kind of want to make up for lost time. I thought he was poised and had composure and showed patience in the post. That told me a lot about his growth and maturity.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every once in a while, someone has a truly inspirational story that demonstrates how hard work, dedication, and a little help from others can lead to success. Pascal Mensah, a freshman on the men’s soccer team, is one of those people.
Mensah grew up in a small village in Ghana as the third oldest of 10 children. Even though he lived in a mud house with dirt floors and his dad had only completed the third grade, Mensah still understood the importance of education.
During Mensah’s childhood, his dad worked for Charles Hutchinson, an American man who came to Ghana to work on a project. When he had time, Mensah helped Hutchinson take care of his adopted kids to help them assimilate to life outside of the orphanage. This connection would be the start of an incredible path, one that would eventually lead him to Harvard.
But first, his next stop was the rainforests of Suriname in South America. Due to the help Mensah had given over the years, Hutchinson decided to take him and his dad.
“It was the first time I’d ever left the country and the craziest trip I’ve taken in my life,” Mensah remembered. “I was experiencing so many new things...I was definitely digging it.”
“Pascal was always earnest, hard-working, and taking advantage of whatever opportunities came his way,” Hutchinson said. “He was a good influence on the kids, and it seemed like the right thing to do to give him some opportunity.”
Mensah attended the American Cooperative School, one of the only schools that provided an American education in the country. At first, it was a struggle; his preliminary tests showed that he had the average vocabulary of a five-year-old. Despite this result, the school placed him in the fifth grade.
He couldn’t have improved as quickly as he did without the key aid of his teachers in middle and high school. To help, his dad also stopped speaking their native language in the house so Mensah could focus on learning English.
“My English definitely started getting better,” Mensah said. “I got list of Newbery Medal books and just went through all of those. It was hard for a while, but I relied heavily on myself and the resources I could find at my school.”
After living in Suriname for seven years, moving back and forth from the major city to the rainforest, he received another unexpected opportunity. Jesse Stone, a sophomore at UNC-Chapel Hill who tutored Mensah’s brothers and sisters, saw his potential and decided to help him go to school in the United States. Eventually, she received enough money through fundraising with her local churches back home for Mensah to travel to North Carolina.
After moving in with Stone’s parents, he faced another setback when he had to repeat his junior year at Veritas Christian Academy. Although it was a jump in academics for him, he managed to beat the odds and graduated as the valedictorian by a mere .01 in GPA.
“It was a personal victory for me and a motivating factor,” Mensah recalled. “I will never forget that you may not always be the most outstanding person in terms of natural talent, but you can always work hard.”
While living in Suriname, he picked up soccer, but Mensah never considered it seriously until playing at school in the U.S. When he was a senior in high school, he compiled a video of his highlights and sent it out to every Division III school that he knew.
It seemed like a shot in the dark, but another stroke of good fortune came his way. He received a message on Facebook from a man whom he had never met, Kevin Ayoola. Like others in Mensah’s past, Ayoola decided to help him get recruited for soccer. Before he knew it, Mensah had heard from Cornell, Duke, and, eventually, Harvard.
“I either found out about Pascal through an Internet story or through his basketball coach, whom I knew previously,” Ayoola said. “I saw a kid that had gone through so many things but still persevered...And he looked so dominant in his videos.”
Mensah took a huge risk when he decided to turn down a full scholarship from Liberty University. Instead, he attended Kimball Union Academy in New Hampshire in the hopes that he could improve his SAT scores and have the chance to play soccer in a Crimson jersey. But it all paid off for him. After six years of high school, he earned a spot on the Harvard soccer team.
“This opportunity is about me enabling others with backgrounds like me to realize their dreams and [to realize] what they would like to do rather than what they have to do,” Mensah said.
From a small, rural village in Ghana to Cambridge, Mensah achieved what seemed impossible. Now, as his journey comes full circle, Mensah wants to play a key role in the lives of others and give them a similarly unexpected chance to find success.

In its home opener against Holy Cross last night at Lavietes Pavilion, the Harvard men’s basketball team came out strong, looking to rebound from a 13-point loss to George Mason last Saturday. Led by co-captain Keith Wright’s 18 points, sophomore guard Brandyn Curry’s 12 assists, and strong team defense, the Crimson dominated the Crusaders and won its sixth straight home opener, 72-49.
Harvard (1-1) came out aggressively, taking a 16-2 lead in the first seven minutes of action against a Holy Cross (0-2) team that returned four out of its five starters from a year ago.
“I’m very, very pleased with our effort, our intensity, and our defense,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “From the start of the game we were energized and excited.”
Junior co-captain Oliver McNally set the tone early, sinking a three-pointer to open the scoring. The Crusaders tallied the next basket, but those were the only points Holy Cross would score over the first seven minutes. Harvard sophomore Christian Webster answered with a three pointer, the first of two on the night for the guard. Curry followed with a mid-range jump shot to put the Crimson ahead 8-2.
After a layup from junior forward Andrew Van Nest and two free throws from Wright, Harvard closed a 14-point run with a crowd-pleasing alley-oop by freshman center Ugo Okam. Although Okam played just nine minutes on the night, the freshman made an impression with three blocks and two dunks.
On defense, the Crimson had similar success, limiting the Crusaders to 39.6 percent shooting and finishing with nine blocks. The team’s defense was also instrumental in igniting Harvard’s offense, as the Crimson scored 22 points off turnovers.
“We didn’t take a lot of bad shots that put us in a bad position to try to get back,” Amaker said. “If you run good offense, there’s a good chance that you’re going to be back and [get] set on defense.”
The team was changing its approach after a disappointing 66-53 loss to the Patriots in its season opener. In the words of Amaker, the team needed to “regroup and respond.” Harvard’s recovery was strong and successful.
“Once we focus on defense and we’re getting the ball and they’re missing shots…we’re able to get into our offense quickly and get open shots and good shots,” McNally said.
At building an early lead, the Crimson cruised for the rest of the half, leading Holy Cross, 32-14, going into the break.
With the game all but decided, the Crusaders rallied in the second period, doubling their number of field goals from six to 12. Holy Cross also shot 75 percent from beyond the arc after missing all three attempts in the first half. Their improved offense managed to score 35 points in the frame but still fell well short of Harvard.
The Crimson was buoyed by another standout performance from Wright. Coming off his second career double-double against George Mason, the forward scored a team-high 18 points, 16 of them coming in the second half. Harvard also benefitted from an all-around effort from Curry, who filled out the stat sheet with 10 points, 12 assists, seven rebounds, and five steals.
The Crusaders were led offensively by guard R.J. Evans, who netted 13 points after shooting four-of-seven in the second half. Guard Devin Brown and forward Dave Dudzinski also chipped in with eight points apiece.
Preseason All-Patriot League First Team selection Andrew Keister finished with zero points and fouled out with nine minutes left to play.
The first victory of the season under its belt, the Crimson is hopeful as it continues its non-conference schedule, even as sophomore forward Kyle Casey recovers from a broken foot.
“I love the spirit of our team right now, and I love the future of our program, and I think the younger guys are coming [along],” Amaker said. “For our kids to be able to do what they’re doing right now with some of those pieces not here for us, I think bodes well for our program in the future.”

With the upcoming release of "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," the muggles of Harvard celebrated with a Harry Potter-themed brain break in Annenberg Hall last night.
The theme was proposed by Caroline G. Cox '14 and Caroline M. McKay '14, a Crimson news comper. McKay said that they had the idea for the study break because of Annenberg’s likeness to the Great Hall of Hogwarts.
Their expectations were high as they hoped to rearrange and decorate Annenberg like the Great Hall and serve Harry Potter-inspired delicacies. Monetary and time constraints forced them to improvise, as they created makeshift wands out of twigs and dressed in Harry Potter-themed colors.
The Quidditch team, the Harvard Horntails, showed up sporting their Crimson jerseys and their Firebolt brooms. This brain break drew the attention of the Quidditch team, not just because of the theme, but because they are currently seeking new recruits.
Others who dressed up for the brain break broke out into mock wizard battles. Dobby, Snape, and other characters performed spells to disarm their opponents while maneuvering around muggles who were trying to escape their textbooks.

Weather predictions for Saturday are partly cloudy, so this year, you may not actually need sunglasses for “The Game.” But if you’re in the mood for some shades, you can protect your eyes from the sunrays while still maintaining your Harvard school spirit.
These sweet shades come with two different messages, “GO HARVARD” and “YALE SUCKS,” allowing you to—if you get both—stay positive in the first half by rooting for your alma mater and following it up in the second half by adding a little insult to injury when we’re winning 35-3 (hopefully) in the fourth quarter.
Even more enticing, this protective eyewear—which comes in pink, blue, yellow, or green—costs $5 dollars each. Have friends and want to save a little money? You’re in luck. Regan Bozman ’13 and Jacob D. Roberts ’13, who are selling the sunglasses, also have a “Blocking Group Special” that comes with four pairs for only $15 (for you English majors, that’s $5 in savings)!
“Our business plan consisted of a Venn diagram: one of the circles had people who like neon sunglasses, and the other had people who hate Yale. Harvard students happened to fall in the little area in the middle,” the duo wrote in an e-mail.
“We had a product that all Harvard students would want,” they added. “Besides vuvuzelas. Those things are awesome too.”

Many commentators have compared the game of football to a military battle, with the head coach as commanding officer.  As the fabled Harvard-Yale game approaches, it appears the U.S. military’s highest ranking officer might think the same.
 
During a speech at the Institute of Politics last night, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike G. Mullen discussed the monumental task that faces the Harvard football team on Saturday.
 
“I’d like to begin our discussion on the nature of conflict, and the ruthless and incorrigible enemy we face today. But I promise not to talk about Yale that long tonight,” he said.
 
It got more serious from there, but Mullen, who is a graduate of Harvard Business School’s Advanced Management Program, returned to Yale in his closing remarks.
 
“Unlike those gridiron battles against Yale, there are no handoffs in national security decision-making. The day you stop asking the hard questions is the day you start losing.”
