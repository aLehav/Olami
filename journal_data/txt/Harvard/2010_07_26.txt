After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PARIS, France—“Just get to the river, turn right, and find us” were the only instructions Sean and I received from Arthur as we walked through the 12th Parisian arrondissement in search of the Seine.
We met Arthur last Monday on the Pont des Arts, a bridge where crowds of French students descend every night to chill together with a bottle of wine. That night we had a mission, the aspiration of any student abroad: to make local friends. It started off as sort of a joke, until we realized that we had brought red wine, but no bottle opener and asked for help.
“Un tire-bouchon s’il vous plait?” A hip-looking French redhead in a plaid shirt and artsy hat opened the bottle for us, and we started talking to him and his friends, a group of architecture students at the University of Paris. As a thank you, we shared our wine, and they shared theirs. And then their vodka, and then their apple juice, and even the absinthe they imported from Spain. When it was ten passed midnight, we decided to go back to catch the last metro. We exchanged numbers with Arthur and his friends and said good-bye.
A week later, we were on our way to meet up with him again. We expected another quiet night of drinking on a bridge.  What we got was a wild underground electro music rave on a raft. We came at 11 pm to find that this party has been hopping since 2 pm with no end in sight. Being there was like watching Luis Buñuel’s Un Chien Andalou for the first time – absurd, surreal, shocking, and fun.
A faithful account of the ensuing events follows. It can also be used as a model for being bohemian for the reference of anyone who is not feeling sufficiently hipster:
2 p.m.–indefinitely: Arthur and friends make Sunday their big party night, as it is the least practical one. Friday and Saturday have become too mainstream.
11:35 p.m.: We are ridiculed for not understanding the difference between house and electro. Apparently, the distinction is key to understanding the life of a French hipster. We are even more criticized for liking Lady Gaga. (Leedi Gaaga? Heads shake with disapproval).
11:55 p.m.: Arthur  illicitly sneaks a bottle of red wine onto the raft. Looks of respect all around.
11:58 p.m., 12:06 a.m., 12:14 a.m. and every 8 minutes for the next six hours: Arthur makes his own cigarette and smokes it.
11:59 p.m.: We start imitating the spontaneous dancing style we see, made up of wild but smooth gestures best described by the word “whatever.”
12:30 a.m.: The music gets turned off. There is kind of a riot.
12:50 a.m.: After raucous protests, people resign themselves to the fact that the first party is over. Everyone is on their cell planning their own underground after-party.
1:02 a.m.: On a Paris nightbus. Arthur is sharing the wine with neighbors.
1:48 a.m.: On another bus. Arthur refuses to share any more alcohol. Sean and I start to realize we are leaving Paris, and don’t know where we’re going.
2:06 a.m.: We arrive to the banlieue, the place outside Paris where the rent is cheaper, sometimes called the ghetto. I get nervous. Sean is feeling great.
2:21 a.m.: We keep walking. It’s very dark and empty. I consider taking a taxi and escaping before it’s too late, but there are no taxis around. We’re really not in Paris anymore.
2:24 a.m.: Arthur sees a chair on the street and takes it. Reason given: we need more chairs.
2:35 a.m: Raggedy old man asks the whole group for a cigarette. They all say they are very sorry, but the Americans don’t smoke (what!?) and they’ve run out. The man tells us that we are all really awful people. The chair Arthur is holding over his head starts breaking, and parts of it almost fall on the man’s head. Now he has a real reason to think we’re evil. We apologize and move on.
2:45 – 3:03 a.m.: Arthur reassembles the chair. We reach Pierre’s apartment. He has been waiting there for the last 40 minutes, and is very happy to see us. Pierre is a part-time student, part-time DJ and has a girlfriend named Lucile. He puts on his headphones, takes out 45-inch records, and starts blasting electro like we’ve never heard before. The place turns into a private disco. Somehow, the neighbors don’t complain.
3:10 a.m.: Lucile silently decides that my outfit needs a change. As I’m dancing, she comes up and begins to tug on my skirt, which renders me somewhat distressed. She says, “Don’t worry, I’m not going to rape you or anything.” That’s a relief. Lucile reaches for my shirt and pulls it into my skirt for me. “There. You’ll be more comfortable.” She goes back to decorating everyone’s arms and legs with permanent marker designs.
3:11 am: Arthur sits down on Sean’s lap, and assures him he is not a homosexual.
3:15–6:13 a.m.: Six person rave. Hours of unrestrained dancing. We all try on the DJ headphones which makes the music sound even more amazing.
4:46 a.m.: I lie down to rest on the couch, and the even electro beat lulls me to sleep. Everyone seems perfectly understanding, until I feel Arthur’s teeth bite into my arm. When I look scared he tells me, “don’t worry. This doesn’t mean anything. It just means we’re becoming friends.” And it’s true, he tackles all the guys and girls in the room in a similar way – the French are much more physical with each other than Americans can imagine. After this, I feel wide-awake and we keep dancing.
5:15 a.m.: The neighbors complain. We turn down the music for ten minutes, and then blast it again.
5:46 a.m.: Arthur is hungry and takes out a huge bowl of rice salad from Pierre’s fridge. He passes the salad around and we all eat some. He puts spoons of rice salad into the mouths of Sean and Jacques.
6:15 a.m.: It is now morning. The metro opens in 15 minutes. We say goodbye and thank you to Pierre and Lucile, and the four of us leave the apartment.
6:30–7:25 a.m.: On the way out, Jacques takes a little boy’s parked bike and looks very happy riding it as we walk to the metro. As we kiss them good-bye on the cheek, they tell us they’re doing the same thing again tomorrow night. We get back to Paris at 7:25 am, leaving us plenty of time before our 9 am class.
7:30 a.m.: We both get a text from Arthur: “Good night friends.”
Having recorded the aforementioned events with our utmost diligence, we hope that it may serve as a fruitful contribution to hipster awareness in America. As academic norm dictates, we end this report with a call for further study.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Affectionately known by her teammates as “Rowlz,” this Harvard baller may be living it up in Europe this summer, but she took the time to reveal everything from her love of spandex to her taste in men. Every week, The Full-Court Press will give you the sort of personal scoop that you’re not likely to hear at a typical press conference.
Name: Caitlin J. Rowland
Year: 2012
Position: Guard
Stats: As a sophomore, Rowland played in all 29 of the Crimson's contests while averaging 3.1 points and 0.9 rebounds per game. Finished second on the team in three point percentage, shooting 42.3 percent from beyond the arc.
Now, to the questions!
1. Typical pre-game meal.
For home games, we always indulge in the delicacies of a catered HUDS meal: grilled chicken, pasta, and salad. I like to mix them together and put balsamic or Italian dressing on the whole thing! num, num, num. Sometimes the meal is supplemented (unofficially) with trips to the vending machine.
2. Songs you listen to before games to get pumped up.
Definitely "Sexy Bitch" by David Guetta ft. Akon—droppin' down before games with Jackie [Alemany '11] and Elle [Hagedorn '13] I'm properly warmed up.
3. Favorite team to play against and why.
Any Ivy League game because there is so much at stake. But especially Yale because it's always extremely intense, emotionally and physically.
4. Most ridiculous thing that has taken place in your team's locker room.
I'm not sure if that should/could be published...
5. Most embarrassing moment you've had on the court.
I've sported some pretty embarrassing hair styles including bangs, french braids and ribbon and bow in my hair, but that's not that bad considering some people (I've heard) pee themselves when they play.
6. Animal that best represents your style of play and why.
An animal that hasn't been discovered yet because my game is like nothing you've ever seen. Or a butterfly because they are pretty.
7. The most ridiculous thing you've heard a fan yell at a game you were playing in.
In high school someone yelled at a teammate "hey cankles, you made this gym smell like fish", which indeed the gym for some unknown reason did reek of fish. Or in college "shouldn't you be studying?"
8. If you could play for another sports team at Harvard, which would it be and why?
 
Either volleyball so I could always lift weights in spandex only at Palmer Dixon [Harvard's strength and conditioning center], or crew so I'd have an excuse for wearing spandex as frequently as Emma Markley [starting forward] does, then that may be the better option.
9. Position you'd play in Quidditch.
I would definitely be the seeker because I'm really good at catching *winged* balls.
10. If you could go on a date with any professional athlete, who would it be?
Either Cristiano Ronaldo, Michael Phelps (I think people who can eat enormous amounts of food are hot), or Andre Akpan [former Harvard soccer standout].

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a game highlighted by former NBA players and Division One standouts from the nation’s top basketball conferences, two Harvard men’s basketball players made the Ivy League proud.
Rising sophomore Kyle Casey and incoming freshman Matt Brown shared the court with the likes of Memphis’s Antonio Anderson and Providence’s Jeff Xavier this past Saturday in the Boston Athletes United for Change Summer League and led their team to victory—combining for more than a third of their team’s points.
While many onlookers at the Tobin Community Center in Boston may have expected Casey—the reigning Ivy League rookie of the year—to be the more impressive of the two Crimson players, it was Brown—a six-foot-three shooting guard out of Northfield Mount Hermon—who stole the show.
Without a game of college basketball under his belt, Brown poured in 20 points while he was matched up against Anderson, a 25-year-old Lynn, Mass. native who did two ten-day stints with the NBA’s Oklahoma City Thunder this past NBA season.
Brown went off in the second half, connecting on a series of transition layups and jump shots to combine for 15 points. Brown got off to a hot start in the second frame, knocking down a three ball from NBA range, then attacking the basket and finishing with a floater over the outstretched arms of Brown sophomore Andrew McCarthy.
The shooting guard tacked on three more layups and a two-handed dunk before the game concluded, but also showed off some range by hitting a deep two early in the second. Receiving the ball beyond the NBA three point line, Brown up faked, then took one dribble and let a shot fly from college range that sank through the net.
While Brown had an impressive performance, Casey was relatively quiet, finishing with just nine points. Characteristically, Casey struggled with staying out of foul trouble, as the 6-foot-7 forward with a 42-inch vertical leap was overly aggressive jumping for rebounds and blocks.
Casey got off to a hot start, combining with Brown to score 10 of their team’s first 13 points. Casey made an and-one layup in transition, and then threw down a two-handed slam on a fast break in the opening minutes.
But Casey struggled with turnovers and missed shots until late in the game when he eventually got to the basket and finished with a layup. Casey capped the game off with a ferocious windmill in the contest’s final second.
Defensively, Casey and Brown alternated between covering Anderson, a small forward who averaged 8.6 points per game as a starter on the Memphis team that reached the NCAA finals in 2008.
While Brown played solid defense and got some shots to fall, he will need to work on shoring up his jump shot and ball handling before he begins his rookie season with the Crimson. Brown will likely start the season deep in the Crimson’s rotation given their strong backcourt, which is led by rising juniors Oliver McNally and Max Kenyi, rising sophomores Brandyn Curry and Christian Webster, and rising freshman Laurent Rivard.
But if Brown’s strong summer league performances can carry over into the upcoming Harvard season, that could soon change.
The Boston Athletes United for Change Summer League takes place Friday nights and Saturday afternoons at the Tobin Community Center in Boston’s Mission Hill. It is one of only two summer leagues in Massachusetts certified by the NCAA and pits current and former NCAA players against professional basketball players of all levels.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Jeremy Lin’s agent Roger Montgomery denied reports surfacing Saturday that Lin had signed a contract to play for Chinese Taipei in international competition
“That’s not true,” Montgomery told The Crimson Monday night. “He didn’t make any decision.”
Though Lin had been contacted about playing for Chinese Taipei, any report that the former Harvard co-captain had actually signed a contract is false, according to Montgomery. But Lin's Wikipedia page had quite the different idea earlier today.
Citing a July 24 article from the Chinese website sports.sina.com.cn, Lin’s Wikipedia page was updated today at 5:17 pm with the following:
“Jeremy Lin has also signed a contract to represent Chinese Taipei in international competitions. However, because the rosters for the Chinese Taipei national basketball team has already been finalized, Jeremy will compete next year.”
Montgomery said the information was false.
