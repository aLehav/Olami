After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Daniel Albright, a professor of Literature, author of 16 books, and a former Guggenheim Fellow, died unexpectedly on Jan. 3. He was 69.
Colleagues remember Albright as dedicated to his students and as a brilliant scholar. “Follow your whim,” a philosophy that rang true in Albright’s own life, was among Albright’s many words of advice to his students, according to his dissertation advisee, Seth P. Herbst ’08.
As an undergraduate at Rice University, Albright originally declared a major in mathematics before switching to English. Upon graduating from Rice in 1967, he attended Yale, where he received his M.Phil in 1969 and his Ph.D. in 1970. Prior to his arrival at Harvard in 2003, Albright taught at the University of Virginia, the University of Munich, the University of Rochester, and the Eastman School of Music.
Once at Harvard, he taught in the English, Music, and Comparative Literature departments. English Department chair and professor W. James Simpson spoke highly of Albright’s career in Cambridge.
“Whenever Dan was in a room, the room was full of fun and amusement and delight because of his range of literary allusions and music allusions,” Simpson said. “He was constantly delighting an audience.”
Albright’s partner, Marta S. Rivera Monclova, echoed memories of his playful manner. She said he loved to make people laugh and added that he never seemed “old.”
“I asked him, why are you not old? He said, ‘I think you only get old when you begin to believe that dignity is important,’” Rivera said. “He believed that play was important. He loved when people just let go of what they thought they were supposed to be doing.”
Albright died exactly five years after the pair first met on a blind date, Rivera said.
Albright was extremely dedicated to the success of his students, according to Rivera. He would always return students’ work with feedback almost immediately, to the point that he would leave the dinner table after receiving an email from one of his students.
One student, Herbst, affirmed Albright’s commitment.
“He’s one of the most extraordinarily distinctive people I’ve ever met,” said Herbst, a tutor in Dunster House. “He was officially a scholar of music and English literature, but he could do anything.”
Indeed, Albright’s scholarly accomplishments were numerous. According to his website, he authored 16 books, many of which addressed relationships between music and literature; most recently, he published “Panaesthetics: On the Unity and Diversity of the Arts.” He also held several fellowships throughout his career, with the National Endowment for the Humanities, as a Guggenheim Fellow, and as a Berlin Prize Fellow at the American Academy in Berlin.
“All accomplishments aside, he was just the most generous and warmhearted and kind mentor one could ever ask for,” Herbst said.
Albright is also survived by his son, Christopher T. Albright of Guangzhou, China.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sometimes a comeback does not equate to a win. Harvard men’s wrestling team (0-1) opened its dual meet season with three meets on the road this weekend. On Jan. 9 at the inaugural Beauty and the Beast event at XFINITY Center in College Park, Md., the Crimson faced Maryland (5-7) in its third meet in five years, looking to record its first win against the Terrapins.
Though Harvard overcame a 15-point deficit by winning four consecutive bouts to tie the game, its efforts were not enough to top Maryland, which won 21-18. What first appeared as a comfortable victory for the Terrapins came down to the final weight class to determine a victor.
“I was a little unsure at first, but we came back strong at the end,” Preston said. “[We] really took it to them in the last four matches and winning three of the last four.”
Maryland had taken the early lead after two bouts. Because the Crimson did not have a competitor for the 125 lbs. weight category, the team had to forfeit the first match, giving Josh Polacek the win and automatic six points. The Terrapins’ No. 18 Geoffrey Alexander defeated his Harvard opponent, senior Ryan Osleeb, by 15 points due to a technical fall. These two wins gave Maryland its 11-0 lead.
“It really makes it tough for our team to come back but our upper weights really did a good job,” Preston said. “So going into that, we knew that we had to…recover up some of those points.”
Preston put the first few points on the board for the Crimson with a 4-0 decision against Shyheim Brown at 141 lbs, cutting the Terrapins’ lead to single digits.
“We just wanted to put some points back on the board and help motivate the guys, and let them know that we were in the match, and that we could win these matches,” Preston said.
At 149 lbs., sophomore Colby Knight lost a close decision to R.J. DeGeorge, 3-1. Maryland then took the opportunity to extend their lead to 18-3 with Louis Mascala’s major decision over freshman Tyler Tarsi in the 157 lbs. weight category.
Things turned around for Harvard after Tarsi’s defeat. The winning streak began with sophomore Tyler Grimaldi over the Terrapins’ Tyler Manion. Grimaldi won the bout in the 165 lbs. weight class 10-4.
The streak continued with freshman Josef Johnson over Josh Snook in a close match, 4-3, at 174 lbs. This was Johnson’s first collegiate win in a dual meet, though the rookie has been impressive thus far in the season, earning major decisions at the Jonathan Kaloust Bearcat Open and the Midlands Championship.
“I think there was probably a lot of doubt as to whether or not we would be able to get it done, and I kept it rolling, which I think inspired a lot of guys, especially the match after me,” Johnson said. “I guess I kind of showed them that if I could do it, they could do it as well. So I think my match was pretty important to the overall scope of the team match.”
Junior Michael Mocco, at 184 lbs., pinned Sean O’Malley at 4:16. With this third consecutive win, the Crimson was within three points of Maryland.
It seemed that momentum was on Harvard’s side with co-captain James Fox’s win—the fourth straight one—in the 197 lbs. weight class against Rob Fitzgerald, 4-0. Fox’s win tied up the match at 18 points apiece.
But it just wasn’t enough.
It came down to the heavyweight match between senior David Ng and Maryland’s newly returned senior Spencer Myers for the game winner. Ng was unable to win a point, as Myers notched an escape in the second period and managed to hold Ng off in the third to win the decision 2-0, and the meet for the Terrapins.
“I think we learned a huge lesson that…we can be right up there,” Preston said. “Even though we are a young team this year, that we can accomplish goals that we set at the beginning of the year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rhode Island, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New York.
The Bears, the Bulldogs, the Huskies, and the Dutchwomen.
When considering the recent schedule of the Harvard women’s hockey team, dizziness, confusion, and whiplash are all explicable responses. But there is a more consistent way to summarize the team’s weeklong trek up and down the Northeast.
Win, win, win, and win.
By cruising to a 7-1 victory over Union (4-14-3, 1-8-0 ECAC) in Schenectady, N.Y., the Crimson maintained a perfect start to 2015 and furthered an eight-game winning streak that began in late November. Six players scored for Harvard (10-2-2, 8-1-1 ECAC), which built a 4-0 lead in the first period.
“Offensively we knew that we were going to have to shoot from all angles and crash the net,” senior forward Lyndsey Fry said. “Union likes to keep teams on the perimeter, so to beat them we knew we’d have to just get gritty and go to the net.”
With the Crimson holding a 3-0 advantage after thirteen minutes, sophomore defenseman Abbey Frazer did just that.
Frazer, who scored her first goal of the season in Harvard’s latest win, had been manning the high right corner of the Crimson’s power-play attack. But when junior forward Miye D’Oench blasted a shot, Frazer crashed the net. Intuition, speed, and luck all converged as the puck rebounded to Frazer, who slipped a finish past the Union goalkeeper.
The Dutchwomen didn’t get on the board until nine minutes remained in the game. By that point, the home team faced a 7-0 hole.
“We always talk about what defines Harvard hockey, and good solid defensive zone play is one of the biggest things we value,” senior defenseman Marissa Gedman said. “Solid defense leads to solid offense.”
At the end of the second period, a kill of a Union power play led to perhaps the most exciting offensive moment of the match.
After returning to full strength, Harvard had just enough time to launch a final attack, and sophomore defenseman Briana Mastel cranked a long-distance shot with one second remaining.
The puck collided with senior forward Samantha Reber, who was standing in front of the goal, unmarked. Reber redirected the shot into the net just before the horn sounded to stretch the score to 5-0.
The late finish echoed the Crimson’s previous game against the Dutchwomen, when Harvard also scored a goal late in the second period. In that November contest, the Crimson won 5-2 despite conceding an early score.
Two months later, it was Harvard that struck first. Five minutes into the game, freshman forward Lexie Laing pushed through a crowd around the goalmouth to poke home a finish. She ended the game with two scores and two assists, her second consecutive performance with three points or more.
“Lexie Laing comes from a great hockey background and knows the game as well as anyone,” Gedman said. “Right now she’s just getting the chances and recognition she has worked for.”
After Reber’s exclamation point to end the second frame, the Crimson entered the third period with renewed energy. Mastel blasted a long-range goal in the first six minutes, and Laing lifted the puck above the goalie two minutes later to cap off the day of scoring.
Laing’s first finish of the game sparked a similar offensive flare-up. After eight minutes of play, freshman forward Karly Heffernan buried a wrist shot following a nifty backhanded pass from junior forward Mary Parker. Fry soon added the team’s third goal by redirected junior defenseman Michelle Picard’s long-range effort.
During its streak of wins, Harvard has scored a first-period goal in all eight games.
“We’ve really been making a conscious effort to come out every game with a lot of energy,” Fry said. “[We] try to stay focused on playing our game consistently and not letting our foot off the gas. You never know what can happen, so we just try…to play the same way whether we’re up one goal or five.”
