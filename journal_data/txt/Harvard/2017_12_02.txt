After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 2, 2017 at 1:08 a.m.
The Department of Justice is “reviewing” Harvard's offer on Friday to give the federal government access to redacted student records as part of its investigation into the College’s admissions practices, according to a department spokesperson.
Seth P. Waxman ’73, a partner at the law firm representing Harvard, wrote in a letter to the Justice Department Friday that Harvard would provide redacted versions of “all of the documents sought” by the Department. The records, Waxman wrote, “include some of the most sensitive information with which Harvard has been entrusted by its students and applicants.”
In the letter, he invited government lawyers to view the documents at the law firm WilmerHale’s Washington, D.C. office during the office’s business hours, instead of allowing the Justice Department to copy the documents.
The Justice Department had threatened to sue Harvard if it it did not comply with its request for documents by Dec. 1. But Harvard’s new plan presents “a potential path forward,” Justice Department spokesperson Devin M. O’Malley wrote in an emailed statement Friday.
“The Department of Justice takes seriously any potential violation of an individual’s civil and constitutional rights. We are pleased that Harvard today indicated it too takes this matter seriously,” O’Malley wrote. “The Department is reviewing the University’s response and declines comment at this time.”
The Justice Department began investigating allegations that Harvard’s admissions processes unfairly disadvantage Asian-American applicants this summer, worrying critics who say the investigation could threaten affirmative action policies in place across higher education. The government is seeking the student records as evidence in the investigation.
In his letter, Waxman condemned the Justice Department’s warning that it could take legal action against the University.
“If the Department follows through on its threat of litigation, it is the Department that will needlessly be delaying the resolution of this matter,” he wrote.
In letters sent to Harvard’s lawyers, the federal government has previously said the University may be violating Title VI, which bars programs receiving federal funding from discriminating based on race. In an emailed statement Friday, University spokesperson Melodie L. Jackson wrote that Harvard believes that its offer to the Justice Department is “in full compliance with our legal obligation under Title VI.”
Friday is the second time Harvard has offered up these student records to defend its admissions practices.  In Oct. 2016, Harvard informed hundreds of thousands of former applicants to the College that their “academic, extracurricular, demographic, and other information” would be used in the discovery period of a separate lawsuit accusing the College of discriminating against Asian-American applicants.
Waxman wrote in the letter Friday that the University does not believe the Justice Department should be able to access personal information contained in the requested student records.
“Harvard is hard-pressed to identify a reason why the Department would need, for example, the names, personally identifying information, and other highly sensitive personal information of its applicants and students,” Waxman wrote. “I must conclude by reiterating my surprise at the course the Department has chosen to pursue.”
Waxman’s letter Friday follows a series of communications between Harvard and the Justice Department in October and November. In the letters, Harvard argued the investigation was “exceptionally unusual” and requested a confidentiality agreement to protect sensitive information in the documents after the federal government requested student records.
The Justice Department denied the request. In a Nov. 17 letter to Harvard’s lawyers, Matthew J. Donnelly, a Civil Rights Division attorney for the Department of Justice, wrote that a confidentiality agreement would be unnecessary given the Department protects confidential information as standard practice.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tomorrow afternoon, Harvard men’s basketball will head into the confines of Rupp Arena, home of No. 7 Kentucky, for what will undoubtedly be a battle of the youth.
The Crimson comes in led by a class of heralded sophomores—in particular guard Bryce Aiken, and forwards Chris Lewis and Seth Towns. For the Wildcats, unsurprisingly, it’s a group of top-ranked freshman, headlined by forward Kevin Knox and guard Hamidou Diallo.
If the statistics are indicative, Saturday’s matchup will see plenty of play for both team’s underclassmen. Harvard (3-5) regularly starts four sophomores—and in the past has started a lineup featuring five of the team’s seven second-years.
All told, underclassmen have accounted for 91.8 percent of Harvard’s total scoring this season.
Playing at Northeastern on Thursday, this youth was on full display for the Crimson in a 77-61 loss to the Huskies. Of the 61 points for the visitors, all but three came courtesy of underclassmen. Forty-six alone came from the duo of Aiken and Lewis.
The story for Kentucky (6-1) hints to an even larger presence of underclassmen. Kentucky starts five freshmen with a total of eight on the roster. The Wildcats don’t have a single senior on their roster, and on the season 100 percent of their scoring has come from underclassmen. The team is the youngest in college basketball based off returning possession-minutes.
The Wildcats enter Saturday’s matchup with a single loss on the season, a narrow 65-61 defeat to No. 2 Kansas in Chicago. Their last win came last Sunday, when the team trounced Illinois-Chicago, 107-73.
For a team that thrived beyond the perimeter last season, Harvard has struggled heavily from deep this season.
The Crimson is shooting just 28 percent from the arc, going 3-of-17 from three against Northeastern in its last outing. Aiken, despite leading Harvard at 19 points per game, has struggled to find his stroke—although he has 43 percent from the field, the sophomore has notched a 29 percent clip from three point range while taking nearly six per game.
Come Saturday, Harvard’s hopes for a competitive game lie in either finding its shot from beyond the arc or getting the ball inside. Given that four of Kentucky’s starters measure up at 6’5’’ or taller, however, the latter would be no easy task. Led by Diallo, arguably one of the most talent wings in college basketball, and an incredibly athletic big in Knox, the Wildcats don’t present many weaknesses.
For the Crimson, the re-emergence of Towns on the offensive end will also be critical to keeping pace with the Wildcats. After averaging nearly 16 points a game through the first five games of the season, the sophomore sat out of a 77-71 win against St. Joseph’s due to illness. Since then, Towns has scored a total of two points in his last two games while going 1-of-9 from the field.
For Harvard coach Tommy Amaker, the record book would imply a win in Lexington on Saturday will be no easy task.
The Crimson’s last ranked opponent came in the form of No. 21 St. Mary’s. The Gaels wasted no time in their drubbing of Harvard, jumping out to a 23-7 lead and handing the Crimson an 89-71 loss.
Since the 2008-2009 season, Harvard has gone 4-12 against ranked opponents. In the last four seasons, however, that mark is tough 0-4, with the low point coming against UVA in a 76-27 trouncing of the Crimson in 2014.
Nonetheless, Harvard enters Rupp with what Amaker has described simply as an opportunity.
“There is more credit starting this year for winning on the road, so we are looking for opportunities,” Amaker said in early November. “That’s the big word for us: opportunities. Hopefully we will embrace them. It is not easy going on the road to be on the road for quite some time. But boy, how will that turn out if somehow if we are pretty successful?”
Regardless of what appears to be an an almost insurmountable task for the Crimson against the Wildcats, Amaker is certainly no stranger to the bright lights of a game against a top opponent. Not long ago, Harvard upset a No. 5 seeded Cincinnati at the Big Dance and took a heavily favored Michigan State team to the brink.
Kentucky coach John Calipari has certainly taken notice.
“Tommy [Amaker]—he’s as good as they get,” said Calipari, speaking to the media on Thursday. “He has a great way about how he coaches and how he gets his teams to play well.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PRINCETON, N.J. — For an entire month, the outlook was bleak for the Harvard men’s hockey team. Behind a frustrated offense, the losses kept piling up, and the Crimson found itself bumped out of the USCHO poll for the first time in a year and a half.
Finally, though, Harvard (4-5-1, 4-3-0 ECAC) has something to build on after registering its first four-point weekend of the season. A 5-2 triumph over Princeton on Saturday completed the weekend’s back-to-back wins.
“We came out and started the game pretty strong,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “We had some good puck-possession shifts…and took advantage of the power play…[but] we had some stretches where we looked like we’re still learning how to play with a lead.”
Leaning on an effective man-up unit, Harvard controlled play early against the Tigers (5-6-1, 3-5-1) and maintained a multi-goal lead for the majority of the contest.
Special teams told the story on Saturday, as the Crimson entered the second period with a two-goal advantage after bookending the first frame with a pair of power play strikes. The cushioned lead did not last long, however, as the Tigers executed on a power play goal of their own almost five minutes into the second period.
After a failed clear attempt by the Crimson killers, Princeton junior Max Véronneau zipped the puck into the slot for senior David Hallisey, who sent it top-left on junior goaltender Michael Lackey.
“I think the puck just rolled on one of our defenseman’s sticks as he tried to get it up,” Lackey said. “[Hallisey] just had a nice shot.”
Like Harvard, however, the Tigers weren’t content with just one goal on the man-advantage. In the final frame, the Tigers potted another power play goal courtesy of senior forward Eric Robinson.
The Crimson’s porous penalty kill was somewhat uncharacteristic, as the team entered Saturday’s contest having relinquished just four goals all season—killing at a rate of 89%—while man-down.
“Tonight our power play stepped up,” coach Donato said. “Our penalty kill has been pretty solid all year and we gave up a couple tonight. When it’s all said and done, there are still a lot of things that we need to improve on.”
Two even-strength tallies in the waning minutes of the second extended the Harvard lead to three goals before the final third of the contest. Junior forward Ryan Donato scored his fourth goal of the weekend on a counter-attack following a promising Tigers chance at the other end. Just a minute later, towering defenseman Wiley Sherman wristed a shot past opposing goaltender Ryan Ferland, providing his team with some extra comfort before the period horn.
The Crimson almost exited the ice after 40 minutes with a four-goal lead, as an Adam Fox backhand attempt was waved off in the final seconds. A delayed too-many-men penalty on Harvard negated the goal, in spite of a challenge by coach Donato.
Despite theCrimson ceding the two power play goals later in the game, sound execution on special teams gave Harvard its early 2-0 edge. First, the man-down unit was called upon, as junior defenseman Jacob Olson, who rejoined the starting lineup on Saturday night after a few games as a healthy scratch, took a slashing penalty a mere two minutes into the game. A sturdy killing effort, however, washed out any hope of an early Princeton score.
Under three minutes later, the Crimson’s special teams were again tested—this time, it was the power play that shined. Just 33 seconds after Tigers forward Luke Keenan was boxed for tripping, Harvard’s first man-up unit cashed in on Ferland.
Donato worked the puck up to sophomore point-man Fox, who furthered it along to rookie blue-liner Reilly Walsh. From the right circle, Walsh ripped a one-timer that beat Ferland on the far side.
“We moved the puck well and had a bunch of looks,” coach Donato said. “We think our power play has looked really good almost all year. We just haven’t been able to cash in.”
With the secondary assist on the Walsh rocket, Donato extended his season-long point streak to 10 games.
Even during stretches of five-on-five hockey, Harvard dominated the first frame, outshooting Princeton, 21-6. With much of the opening period being played in the Tigers’ defensive third, the Crimson drew multiple penalties on tired Princeton skaters. After the Walsh goal, Harvard’s power play received two more man-up chances in the first period.
“[Wearing the other team down] is something that we’ve tried to pride ourselves on for years now,” junior forward Lewis Zerter-Gossage said. “Getting it deep, working behind the defense, we’ve worked on it a lot in practice and…we’ve been drawing penalties. We’ve been scoring goals off it.”
While the Crimson failed to convert on its second attempt with the extra man, another tripping infraction from Princeton late in the frame led to a Zerter-Gossage goal. The winger snatched the puck from the corner-boards and, despite an open Donato tapping his stick on the ice, called his own number in the slot. Zerter-Gossage’s wrist shot snuck past Ferland just 24 seconds into the power play.
After the Tigers answered Harvard’s earlier power play goals with man-up success of their own, an empty-net goal from freshman forward Jack Badini put the Tigers to bed. Badini secured a 5-2 win despite a rallying effort from Princeton in the third period, as indicated by a 14-2 disparity in shots.
Coach Donato will still take the solid start, which has been a point of emphasis all season long in the locker room.
“Establishing that lead by getting off to a good start is always a good recipe for success,” the bench boss said.
On Saturday night, coach Donato rode Lackey’s strong play after the junior nabbed a win in his first action of the season the night before. This change between the pipes comes at a cost, however, as tri-captain Merrick Madsen has been forced to watch from the sidelines this weekend, ending his 55-game start streak spanning three seasons.
Lackey finished the weekend with a 2.00 goals against average and .940 save percentage, numbers that should earn him more starts in the future.

It’s that time of the year again, folks: winter formal season.  Much like your section TF, these dances can be extremely nice… but almost too good to be true.  With this comes the eternal question: to go or not to go?  We can help you make that decision by considering a few simple factors.
The Cost
On any normal day, $20 for a dance wouldn’t seem so outrageous, but it’s the holiday season.  Your mother’s already guilted you into buying gifts for everyone in the family.  Yes—even your fourth cousins thrice-removed.  Low on money, you balk at the cost of all these dances.  Plus, if you go to more than one, the price can very quickly add up.  If you don’t want to run your bank account into the ground, you go to a maximum of a few of these. Do not treat formals as Pokemon—you don’t have to catch ‘em all.
The Date
Ever wanted to talk more with that girl in section?  Or that guy you see across from you in the library every day?  Winter formals give you the perfect excuse to ask them out without seeming like an overly forward, sex-deprived ghoul.  That is, of course, with the exception of Kirkland’s infamous Incestfest, with its distinct Alabama feel and square dancing. K-House readers…maybe don’t invite someone to that.
The Number
Seriously, the River Houses have so many, there’s a winter formal for every time Cher has had a Botox injection or facelift.  On the other hand, Quadlings are about as dance deprived as that ridiculous town from Footloose.  So go to Quad Formal while you have the chance to dance!
The Timing
Next week, when you’re running around the Yard at 4 a.m. completely plastered from the three jelly shots, half a bottle of tequila, and entire bottle of Sauvignon you sipped at (chugged) that night, let us know if you think Reading Period is supposed to be “formal.”  Yeah, we didn’t think so.
The Timing, Part Two
Are you a freshman? Don’t go. You’ll get your turn. For now, you can hold on for spring formals. Are you a freshman who’s been invited by an upperclassman? Okay, go. Just do not brag to all your friends about it. You got a formal date, not a Nobel prize.
Stay safe and formal on, kids.
