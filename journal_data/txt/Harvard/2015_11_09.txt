After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
His name is displayed in the first slide of his PowerPoint, projected in familiar large white letters on a black background—a name that can be found on the waistbands of underwear, the straps of bras, and perhaps even a t-shirt or two: Calvin Klein. This Monday, Nov. 2, the famous fashion designer gave a lecture at the Graduate School of Design about the role of architecture in his work and the evolution of his ability as a businessman.
Klein was invited to the GSD as part of its Rouse Visiting Artist Lecture series. “We really see these as opportunities to bring other people of a creative process in other areas to tell us about their processes [and] their influences and what really feeds their desire to design or create or be an artist,” says Benjamin J. Prosky, Assistant Dean for Communications at the GSD.
According to Prosky, Mohsen Mostafavi, Dean of the GSD, met Klein at an event in New York last year and, after a good conversation, decided to invite him to Harvard to hold a lecture. “I think that you can draw a lot of comparisons between fashion design and architecture,” Prosky says. “There’s attention to materials; there’s attention to envelope, if you will. A jacket or clothing is an envelope as much as the walls of a building…and there’s a precision in making it all fit well.”
Prosky said that attendees of the lecture were mainly students of architecture and landscape architecture, so although Klein’s work is mainly in the realm of fashion design, he drew many connections to the students’ fields. Klein showed slides of his advertisements and photoshoots involving physical structure as well as pictures of the interior and exterior design of his own residences. “As an architect, you have to divide space in a way that is practical and really works,” Klein said as he showed a shot of a Calvin Klein storefront. The New York City store’s large windows, separated by white inset Ionic columns, are representative of the brand’s characteristic simplicity and minimalism, according to Klein.
As his work has often been revolutionary in its field, Klein said his motives were frequently questioned in the early stages of his career. “People used to ask me all the time if I was trying to create controversy,” Klein said. He showed slides of advertisements featuring models wearing only his jeans or in some cases or nothing at all—pictures that were considered scandalous when they were first released. “And the answer was no. I was working with talented people around the world, and they were really pushing the envelope.”
Throughout the lecture, Klein continuously emphasized how he had an innovative vision he wanted to attain. “I always like to find new talent,” Klein said. “I like to discover models…. I love working with people who are not famous and haven’t done lots of things. It gives me the opportunity to work closely and get what my vision is.” Furthermore, Klein noted that he accepted no compromises to achieve these artistic goals; he was stubborn with his work not only in fashion but also in the architectural design of his own houses and offices. “I don’t hand it off,” he said. “I work on every detail with every designer…. I think I know what I want.”
Prosky believes that students had plenty to take away from Klein’s lecture. “Creative people should hear from each other. They shouldn’t only hear from people specifically in their field,” Prosky says. “It’s a given that Calvin Klein is a successful designer and someone who’s had great design influence. They don’t need to learn how to design like Calvin Klein. What they need to see is how someone who obviously had a passion and drive for design made it their life, made it into a successful brand, and changed a whole field.”

“Here’s a place where I have never been. / Guido with no intervening actors, / Guido at the mercy of detractors,” Italian filmmaker Guido Contini (David A. Sheynberg ’16) sings as his personal and professional lives crumble around him. Despite what he says, Guido is never without these “intervening actors” in “Nine,” which runs Nov. 6-14 on the Loeb Mainstage. The manifold women in his life not only keep Guido from the supposed task at hand, making a new movie, but also steal the show’s spotlight with vivid imaginings of their own creation. These strong performances carry the production, despite a few drawn-out and disconnected moments.
Guido’s women breeze in and out of his life and daydreams, inspiring him on screen and off, to the detriment of his marriage and his career. Carla (a stunning Laura Sky Herman ’19), Guido’s mistress, is one such phenom. During the number “A Call from The Vatican,” she flirts with and distracts Guido from his wife, Luisa (Kyra T. Weeks ’16), and even more so from himself. Herman successfully navigates the line between playing a coquette and tapping into a more serious, raw spirit of performance. She physically dominates the entire stage, and in her presence everyone else—including Guido—does not matter. “Who won’t care if you come to me tired and overworked? / I won’t, bambino,” she belts, whipping out jazzy split-kicks with amazing extension. Scenes later, in the ballad “Simple,” Herman proves her crafting of Carla is anything but simple. Her vocal talents shine, so much so that her songs, while ostensibly directed toward Guido, stand without him.
In Sheynberg’s hands, Guido’s onstage persona bounces between a slightly awkward awe of the women around him and a red-faced eagerness that often verges on mania. When Guido and Luisa arrive at a Venetian spa so he can try to “clean my mind and live like a monk,” a gaggle of reporters surrounds him: “Please, one question at a time,” he says, coming off as more grateful for the attention than genuinely cool. It is all a dream for Guido—the spa; his fantasies about women, which sometimes include his soft-spoken mother (Marisa N. Salatino ’18); even the filmmaking process. Sheynberg’s Guido conveys a sense of reality as a confusing burden, and when he croons, “I don't want to wake tomorrow morning at the bottom of some heap,” he seems to mean it. Similarly, Sheynberg himself seems stuck in a daydream throughout the production; in the presence of such strong female performances, he is sidelined.
Sarah B. Rossman ’19 delivers one of the show’s comic highpoints as Guido’s questionably competent producer, Liliane La Fleur. As she tries to prod Guido to care about his floundering career, La Fleur also focuses on her own performance, believably caught up in a splashy musical scene rather than helping Guido to make his film. In the number “Follies Bergeres,” she triumphs as emcee of her own cabaret, complete with a chorus of dancing girls and sly jabs at every Tom, Dick, and Harry in the audience (“What’s a name with...spunk?” Rossman coyly jokes, breaking the proverbial fourth wall and eliciting laughs. “Tom, would you like to roll off of my tongue?”), not to mention a well-timed rollout of a red feather boa. It is all a bit caricaturish, a bit garish, perhaps as it should be. “This is what I want,” she sings. “I want ‘le singing.’ I want ‘le dancing.’” Rossman portrays La Fleur as a woman who wants to put herself at the stage’s center; what she does not seem to want, or even care about, are Guido and his film.
The actors—from Guido to an apparition of a childhood temptress, Sarraghina (an alluring Chloe A. Brooks ’19), to the rest of the women in the Siren-like ensemble—play out their lives in their imaginations. “I remember thinking on seeing it how beautiful it would be, if we could really live in a world like the one Contini had created,” one of Guido’s fangirls says in a scene in which the women reminisce about what Guido and his films mean to them. But that world, as well as the one staged in “Nine,” would not be as beautiful as she suggests but, rather, fuzzy and at times confused. Although punctuated by powerhouse freshman performances, in the end “Nine” becomes a show for the sake of spectacle, with a surfeit of gaudy pink light to boot.

"I wrote this show because I believe storytelling is an antidote to apathy,” says Michael S. Gellman ’17, creator and director of “HOME,” a new HRDC production that runs Nov. 12-19 in the Loeb Ex. This original, student-written play focuses on the challenges facing homeless youth. The cast hopes the play will raise social awareness of homelessness in Harvard Square; all proceeds will be donated to Y2Y, the new local homeless shelter for youth.
The play is based on interviews with homeless individuals in Harvard Square. “I was really interested specifically in the power of narrative and using the written and spoken word to both empower the group of people who are unfortunately marginalized in our society and allow others who are not as connected to this group of people…to understand their lived experiences,” Gellman says. The cast is an ensemble of four actors, who transition between playing homeless characters, third party narrators, and themselves in order to encompass a wide variety of interactions.
The cast hopes the play will leave an impression on viewers. “There are some real heavy themes around sexual abuse, physical abuse, emotional abuse, addiction, depression, mental health, and other health issues,” Gellman says. At the same time, he believes the play will transcend a mere consideration of these obstacles. “More than just the tragedy, what’s impactful is how genuine, intelligent, interesting, and passionate these people are,” Gellman says. Through this play, he hopes that the audience will be encouraged to see the homeless as real, three-dimensional human beings with stories, aspirations, and unique personalities.
As a result of the play, the actors have found themselves increasingly invested in the problem of youth homelessness. “Part of it that’s challenging is that we’re learning so much about this issue… [it] is going to continue after the lights go down and the audience leaves,” says actress Nina C. Sapers ’17. For the cast, the challenge of the play lies not only in successfully putting on the production but also in handling the emotional effects of becoming so deeply involved in the issue.

“HOME” hopes to address the reality of homelessness in the Harvard Square area in a new way, a goal to which the entire cast is deeply committed. “There is a reason we’re doing this—it’s not just for our own indulgence, we’re not just there for the joy of acting. I think this issue is important to all of us for our own reasons,” says actress Sara Bobok ’19. Through its dedicated cast and true-to-life subject material, “HOME” aims to provide a deeply authentic and unique take on the reality of being homeless as a young person.

This weekend, the Hyperion Shakespeare Company pays homage to its favorite playwright, in a production complete with cross-dressing heroines and forced double weddings. “Mo’Money, Motif,” the latest installment of the company’s biannual scene recital, runs Nov. 13-14 in the Adams Pool Theatre. Over the course of the show’s 80 minutes, audience members can expect a mashup of comic, dramatic, and romantic favorites from Shakespeare’s oeuvre.
“Mo’Money, Motif” consists of a series of student-directed scenes chosen from different Shakespeare plays. Nathaniel J. Brodsky ’18, one of the show’s co-directors, hopes that audiences will enjoy the contrasts among the pieces, which are drawn from all sides of the Shakespearean canon. “I’ve tried to order them in a way that could flow like a coherent story,” Brodsky says. “But part of what makes it so fun is that you do get this mishmash of scenes that don't relate but are all entertaining.”
The cast highlights the show’s inclusivity as another of its drawing points. “This year's scene recital is especially different because we're taking the original mission of the scene recital to the nth degree,” producer Jerry G. Nelluvelil ’18 says. “We are here for literally anyone to participate and get to know Shakespeare and his work in a fun environment.”
Towards that goal, the casting process for this semester’s scene recital was especially welcoming; every student who auditioned was able to participate in the show. As a result, the recital will be many students’ first Harvard acting experience. Actress Cecilia C. Laguarda ’17, who plays the King of France in a scene from “All’s Well That Ends Well,” says that the openness of the show allowed it to draw a wider variety of student actors than typical HRDC productions. “It's so flexible and fits in well with my other commitments, so I can do theater without being a ‘theater kid,’” Laguarda says.
Brodsky believes that the relaxed nature of the show will translate into a more accessible atmosphere onstage. “The audience gets to see that Shakespeare is enjoyable to watch and not some over-the-top monstrosity that doesn't connect to them,” he says. With the distinctive diversity of both its performers and its scenes, “Mo’Money, Motif” aims to create an engaging experience for those onstage and off.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A few weeks ago, my friends and I were joined at dinner by a tutor in our House. As conversations tend to do, ours drifted from topic to topic until it somehow settled on religion. The tutor expressed strongly anti-religious views: Religion’s claims are not only false, but contrary to reason; it engenders fanaticism; it causes people to behave in irrational and dangerous ways. To make matters worse, all these things are obvious, and religious people are too blinded by their myths to see the plain truth.
I was shocked to hear someone I had always considered thoughtful and intelligent level these reductive charges against religion, and with such a lack of nuance. (I want to make it clear that his remarks caused no offense, that he spoke without malice, that the conversation which followed was civil, and that he somewhat moderated his views.) But as we spoke, it became obvious that he held pernicious assumptions about all religions and all religious people. I wondered what would happen if he made analogously bad assumptions and generalizations about something else, like race, class, gender identity, or sexual orientation. That conversation left me with a keen awareness that, for some reason, many people here at Harvard view religion as peculiarly bad, dangerous, or silly.
I am not trying to argue that religion should not be criticized. Far from it: I think that criticizing religion—both religion in general and particular manifestations of it—makes religion and its votaries better. It forces people to reflect on the institutions and traditions associated with their faiths, and to be informed and aware as to what they believe and why. It also serves as a catalyst for necessary change. As a person of faith, I am glad there are critics of religion. However, I wish that more of those critics were informed, that more of them did better than simply parroting Bill Maher, Richard Dawkins, and Sam Harris, and that more of them understood what they were criticizing. In other words, I wish that critics of religion took more time to familiarize themselves with the thoughtful religious perspective.
But more than this, I wish that we expected this of them. I wish that we expected their arguments to be as logically rigorous (and modest) and historically informed as we expect the arguments of religious apologists to be. As one of those apologists, I am aware that my defense of faith cannot be premised on uncertainty, the miraculous, or a lacuna in our understanding of the natural world. Atheist critics, however, are given passes when they casually blame religion for both virtually all historic and present-day suffering and violence, when they ignore the metaphysical or moral problems with their own theories, or when they conflate tradition with superstition. Being a community whose common purpose is scholarship and intellectual exploration, we fail ourselves when we fail to question attacks on religion as vigorously as we do its defenses.
The purpose of this column is not to defend of religion. Offering an adequate defense, one that is able to fairly articulate the points made by critics of religion and give thoughtful responses to them, is too large a project to take up here. Instead, I hope to bring to light an atmosphere where religion is, in very subtle yet unmistakable ways, looked down on.
Anecdotes abound. I could write about the time when two of my friends were sitting in a dining hall discussing the declining influence of religion in America and a stranger felt compelled to insert himself into their conversation just long enough to say, “Isn’t that great?” Or I could write about how some people listen to me explaining my religious beliefs with palpable amusement or condescension. Or I could write about how and why a Catholic student I know, when telling people he is involved with various Christian student associations, feels the need to include, “and I ‘believe it.’” But I am not a skilled enough writer to tell a story in a way that would communicate the subtle bias many people have against religion.
Harvard is a wonderful place, filled with wonderful people. I am not trying to say that we go to school in a hot-bed of anti-religious fever. All I mean to do is make people aware of a prejudice that, although mostly benign, can do real damage to our discourse. I will close with an observation my roommate made: Harvard has myriad classes, tutors, and resources specializing in racial and sexual sensitivity, but nothing analogous for religion. I do not want to create an office of religious sensitivity, but I think it is telling to examine what we choose to be sensitive toward, which sometimes is just another way of saying what we choose to be informed about.

Students, faculty, and administrators all know that the College’s Program in General Education is broken. Last spring, a report from a faculty review committee found the program “failing on a variety of fronts,” and the College continues to search for solutions. Most recently, at last week’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences and Committee on Undergraduate Education meetings, members of the review committee introduced proposals that would streamline the program.
One suggested change would require students to take four courses similar to current Gen Ed classes as well as one distribution requirement in each of the College’s three divisions—Sciences, Social Sciences, and Arts and Humanities. Students would also need to take one mathematics-based course, equivalent to the current Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning requirement.
It is encouraging to see the faculty putting forward tangible proposals in the hopes of correcting the College’s deeply flawed Gen Ed system. But the details of the proposal from last week’s meeting do not offer the kind of change that Gen Ed needs.
Harvard’s Gen Ed program needs not just tweaking, but a broader restructuring. Right now, many courses that should fall within a certain Gen Ed area do not satisfy the requirement, and students are too often left scrambling to fulfill requirements for which they should no longer be responsible. Many see their Gen Ed requirements as carveouts for easy courses. Taken together, these side effects of Gen Ed’s structure work against the program's ambitious goals.
The ideas discussed by faculty and students last week only represent an adjustment to the current program. Broadening some of the Gen Ed areas into distribution requirements would be a step in the right direction, but maintaining four Gen Ed-like courses would likely perpetuate the same failures that plague the system today.
Instead, the Gen Ed system needs a complete overhaul. The most appealing option the committee has suggested for the College to divide each course into one of several categories and create a classic distribution requirement, giving students more flexibility to choose classes according to their interests. Some may argue it would squander the Gen Ed system’s goal of preparing students for the art of living as “mature adults in the world at large,” but the program’s level of success so far highlights the impracticality of so ambitious an aim.
A strong program for giving students a broad-based education is critical to Harvard’s role as a liberal arts school. That is why the College must continue to explore alternatives to the current system. As faculty continue to fine-tune their proposals, they should aim for big changes, and not allow Gen Ed's current flaws to sneak into its future iterations.

Lately, I’ve been feeling a lot like gushing meat.
Let me explain.
 “For the Young Woman I Saw Hit by a Car While Riding Her Bike” seems morbid, I know. But Laura Kasischke’s poem is meant to be evocative. The poet sees a young woman get hit by a car and calls 9-1-1. The woman is fine and so is her bike (“Not one bent spoke on either tire”) but the poet is “shaking and sobbing too hard to say good-bye.” Even the driver who hit her, we learn, “did little more than roll his eyes.”
The poet tells us how the witnesses who saw the accident seemed uneasy at the poet’s own obvious unease. “Are you okay?” one stranger asks the poet. “Are you all right?,” another. “They should have put her / in the ambulance, not me,” the victim declares.
So they act like this. “Uneasily / As if / overhearing my heartbeat / and embarrassed for me / that I was made / of such gushing meat / in the middle of the day on a quiet street.”
I first read this poem in an English class that was all kinds of magical, where the professor compared villanelles to gumdrops and the TF brought in oversized muffins for breakfast, often, by which I mean twice a week. At the time, I was a jaded and veteran Lamontster who could tell you what café sofas had stains and where, at once disgusted and proud of such intimacy with that hellish library. I had learned, perhaps too fast, that surviving (no, thriving) at Harvard meant becoming, in many ways, numb.
Learn to ask a person how they are and except a stock reply in turn. Learn to bullshit an Expos essay, to be sure, but more importantly to bullshit your way through a comp hierarchy, then through that same exclusive organization’s election season, then the other exclusive organizations—you know, the Fly or the Bee or even now the Spee. Finally, of course, if you haven’t already, learn to eat the right amount of free food and spit out the right cordial phrases at Goldman banquets.
Learn to feel less.
I’m not sure what happened—if it was the right amount of distance, or (for you Social Studies 10 folks) if it was some a natural part of the dialectic, a guttural reaction to my first year at Harvard. But I’m starting to feel a lot more this year.
Everything moves me. Sometimes comically so.
The way the buildings in the Yard jut out like crooked teeth. How Memorial Church towers above the rest of them like an overgrown molar. The way HUDS put a screeching witch in Pfoho’s dhall during Halloweekend. How my friend whistles to “Trap Queen” in between venting about an unresponsive lover.
A few weeks ago, a fellow Crimson columnist and I were trudging from the Quad to Lowell lecture hall for an open-mic event. The moon hung in the dark sky—cradled, it seemed, by invisible strings. As we entered the Johnston Gate, light from a pole near Mass Hall refracted onto the crisp maroon and green and yellow leaves dangling from a nearby tree.
I felt very much like gushing meat at that moment and told her so.
“I’m trying to figure out, fam,” she said very seriously, “when it is that you feel this way.”
I’m trying to figure this out, too.
All I know is that I feel a little faint when my British English professor reads the line, “What do I think about life? A little and a lot,” from “Effi Briest”. He’s read this at least four times in lecture, and each time I felt something escape my chest. I felt light.
I know that when I walk downstairs to the dining hall and see tutors’ kids waddling and toppling—see them dressed in Superman capes in November or wrapped in only a towel, see them throwing peas on the floor or gazing up, starry-eyed, at the ceiling—my legs get woozy, and I have to hold tight to the railing as I carry my tray up.
My friend still believes that it’s my iron deficiencies causing these corporeal reactions. She might be right. But still, I know that there’s a certain reverence for life, a certain overabundance of awe, that washes over me sometimes, unannounced, hammering on the heart’s door at 4 a.m. I know that my heart loudly beats at these moments because they remind me that every moment is in fact fleeting, that every moment should be imbued with an extra ounce of meaning.
That every moment calls for me to be “made of such gushing meat / in the middle of the day on a quiet street.” Or at least, to live like I am.

UPDATED: November 9, 2015, at 1:45 p.m.
The price tag on a Harvard undergraduate education, when adjusted for inflation, increased by nearly one-third between 1998 and 2015, according to a recently released report by The Chronicle of Higher Education.
The report tracked the changes in the “sticker price,” or the published tuition and required fees, at 3,417 institutions across America between 1998 and 2015. The 2015 “sticker price” for Harvard, $45,278, marked a more than 31 percent inflation-adjusted increase from the corresponding 1998 price.
Over the same period, and particularly in the last decade, the College's financial aid program has also grown significantly. In 2004, then-University President Lawrence H. Summers launched the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative, and that year the College spent $73 million on aid, according to Rachael Dane, a Harvard spokesperson. In 2014 that figure was $170 million, Dane wrote in an email, and the average college student paid $12,000 for tuition, room, and board.
The tuition report also tracked changes in room-and-board costs for the same set of institutions between 2008 and 2015. Harvard’s room-and-board costs increased by more than 26 percent between 2008 and 2015.
Howard E. Gardner ’65, a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, did not find the results surprising.
“While four-year liberal arts colleges do not openly collude with one another, their rises in tuition are amazingly parallel over the years: roughly 4-5% in recent years,” Gardner wrote in an email, stating that colleges try to “avoid making the biggest raise because it looks bad, but they have little incentive to be at the bottom of the pack.”
Gardner added, however, that students do not commonly compare schools based on these small differences in price.
“We don’t hear students say, ‘I am going to College A rather than College B because it raised its tuition 1% less than its competitor,’” he wrote.
According to Gardner, Harvard’s large endowment enables the University to be less financially dependent upon tuition than almost any other school and to enjoy “more degrees of freedom” in setting its tuition, though Harvard “does not take advantage of” the freedom.
“The losers are private colleges and universities that are not well endowed, cannot provide sufficient scholarships to all needy students, and yet don't want to charge more than the wealthy schools, lest they lose even more students to those wealthy schools,” he wrote.
Gardner considers Princeton to be Harvard’s closest competitor in terms of tuition independence. According to the new report, Princeton saw a nearly 25 percent increase in its tuition and fees since 1998, while Yale has seen an even larger spike in the cost of its undergraduate education, jumping a more than 37 percent in the past 17 years.

With midterms in full swing and finals on the horizon, undergraduate members of the Honor Council—the student-faculty body tasked with implementing the College’s first honor code—are reaching out to their classmates in dining and lecture halls about the goals and philosophy of the young committee.
Before the Honor Council replaced the College’s Administrative Board in hearing cheating cases this fall, some undergraduates and faculty members were skeptical that it would actually prompt any true “culture shift” around academic integrity on campus, as its creators say they hope it will. Now undergraduate Honor Council members say they are looking to make strides in changing how their peers think about and discuss academic integrity, an effort they say is going smoothly so far. 
“The honor code asks us to be reflective and introspective in a different kind of way,” said Nathaniel R. F. Bernstein ’17, a voting member of the Honor Council. “We’ve been looking for a lot of different ways to engage the community in conversations about what academic life is.”
Bernstein and other Honor Council members have been hosting informal office hours in their dining halls to discuss the honor code with students. Council members have also visited some classes to give short presentations on what the policy entails: Students are now required to sign an affirmation of their awareness of the honor code before each final exam and include an affirmation statement with final papers and projects.
“There are still some people who are skeptical as to whether or not [the honor code] is going to be an effective agent for change, so the d-hall office hours provide us an opportunity to explore those concerns,” Bernstein said.
Bernstein added that the Honor Council chose to meet in the dining halls because they are “places that are central to our experience as undergraduates—places where we learn from each other.”
According to Matthew J. Vegari ’17, a voting member on the Council, the office hours have seen “varying degrees of success,” but he said he has received largely positive feedback from students.
“I think we’ve had tremendous success with the freshmen, not only because we do the most outreach, but also they’ve never been to a school without an honor code,” Vegari said. “With the higher up students, there’s a little bit of cynicism, but most people have come around to the idea that this is not going away—that Harvard College will be a school with an honor code.”
The Council’s attempt to engage upperclassmen comes three years after the College’sinvestigation into the Government 1310 cheating scandal—Harvard’s largest in recent memory—when most current seniors were freshmen. Though that incident helped propel administrators’ efforts to create and enact the honor code that established the Honor Council, the scandal is far from Council members’ minds as they look to change the undergraduate academic culture, said Jack W. Jue ’18, a student academic integrity fellow involved with the body.
Instead, the Honor Council is focusing on moving forward and “trying to actually change the culture” around academics at Harvard through direct contact with students, Jue said.
“Communication is important for making any change actually happen, because what happens on paper only goes so far,” Jue said. “You have to actually work with people you’re trying to help to change.”

With unseasonably warm temperatures reaching highs in the 70s on Thursday and Friday—more than 15 degrees warmer than Cambridge’s early November average—Harvard might have removed its multicolored chairs from the Yard prematurely.
With guitars, bikes, and class assignments in tow, faculty, students, and Cambridge residents flocked the Science Center Plaza and Harvard Square on Thursday and Friday to enjoy what could be the last warm days leading up to New England’s notoriously harsh winter months.
“Every day that it’s warm, I think this is the last nice day before winter,” said Music professor Thomas F. Kelly, who went for a bike ride in shorts along the river on Thursday.
Zoe A. Kessler ’17 also said she was taking advantage of the weather to enjoy one of her favorite pastimes: The guitar.
“I’ve been playing outside this week,” said Kessler, an inactive Crimson arts editor who was sitting at a table in the Science Center Plaza with a friend on Friday.
And for those who would be partaking in outdoor activities regardless of the weather, the unexpected warmth was a welcome surprise.
Denise Acosta ’16, a member of the sailing team, did not have to wear layers during practices last week, as she typically does at this time of the year. The warm weather has drawn her outside more than is usual, she said.
“Instead of studying indoors,” she said, “I go outside, or I go and get coffee with friends.”
But not all students could enjoy the warm weather. Jae S. Lee ’19 said he was disappointed he could not spend time outside due to a heavy course load. “If I didn’t have CS50, I’d definitely be going outside,” he said.
Although Harvard affiliates and Cambridge residents said they appreciated the uncharacteristically warm temperatures, Sebastian S. Kimberk, as senior at the local Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, expressed concern about the weather’s ecological implications.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In front of a packed chapel of about 600 attendees, Y2Y Harvard Square celebrated its upcoming opening on Friday as the nation’s first student-run youth homeless shelter alongside U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren.
The shelter, now set to open to young adults between the ages 18 and 24 in December, looks to serve as a “sanctuary” for local homeless youth. Shelter staffers will include volunteers from Harvard’s Phillips Brooks House Association, young adults who have previously experienced homelessness, and members of Y2Y’s adult advisory board.
The shelter is in the final phases of construction in the basement of First Parish Church, the venue for Friday’s ceremony. It will supplement existing services of Youth on Fire, an organization that offers LGBTQ-friendly daytime drop-in services for homeless youth ages 14 to 24 seven days a week.
The day before Friday’s launch event, more than 300 donors helped complete a $50,000 crowdsourcing campaign, marking the end of a $1.25 million capital campaign.
The Friday ceremony focused on thanking elected officials, community groups, construction partners, advisers, advocates, and donors who supported Y2Y, led by co-directors Sarah A. Rosenkrantz ’14 and Samuel G. Greenberg ’14.
“We weren’t built by our hands alone,” said Needham B. Hurst, the shelter’s data director. “It was the community that came together.”
Warren, the senator from Massachusetts, kicked off the event, reflecting on the shelter’s construction and praising everyone who supported the endeavor.
“[Sam and Sarah] said, ‘We are...going to get out there and advocate on behalf of those who need our voices to be heard,’” Warren said. “They saw a problem, they had a vision for how to fix it, and that’s what’s going on downstairs.”
“Homelessness is one of those things that people really see and get so used to ignoring,” said Jamila Bradley, a member of the Y2Y team who called attention to the advocacy work that preceded the opening of the shelter. “To have trips to the State House matter and have a permanent and tangible result and response...I don’t have words for that.”
While Y2Y Harvard Square’s space is on the cusp of completion, the shelter’s work is in its early stages. Looking forward to the routine operations of the shelter, Greenberg said he anticipates “22 meals to prepare every night, hundreds of dishes to wash, and loads of laundry to do—in a lot of ways [the] journey is just getting started.”

TEDxHarvardCollege—the first TEDx event held at Harvard—brought hundreds of people to the Radcliffe Knafel Center Saturday as various Harvard affiliates discussed the challenges and opportunities they say will accompany the global population’s expected growth to nine billion by 2050.
The event, entitled “9 Billion: Surviving and Thriving in 2050,” followed the format of the popular Technology, Education, and Design conferences. Student-organized TEDx events, which are organized independently of TED itself, have been popular on college campuses in recent years, but Christian G. B. Haigh ’17 and Eva Shang ’17 noticed that the platform was missing at Harvard, prompting them to organize Saturday’s event.
“From school to school, people don’t communicate, and people don’t connect, and I think that too much of the research that is really interesting and groundbreaking and innovative going on at Harvard is not well-known by the world at large,” Shang said. “That’s why I think the TED platform is so powerful.”
The first half of TEDxHarvardCollege focused on addressing the social, environmental, medical, and energy problems that speakers said will come with a great population increase.
Harvard applied physics professor David W. Keith, once named one of TIME Magazine’s heroes of the environment, made a case for research into solar geoengineering, which looks to combat rising global temperatures by reflecting a portion of the sun’s radiation.
Daniel G. Nocera, Harvard’s director of graduate studies in chemistry and chemical biology, called for developing infrastructure that would allow for more efficient and innovative ways to harness solar energy. As an example, he presented his work to create artificial leaves that convert solar energy to storable and usable hydrogen.
Nina L. Hooper ’16 also delivered a presentation at the event after she won a competition earlier this year that selected the student speaker. Her talk focused on the possibility of asteroid mining and her research at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, where she is working to develop methods to detect platinum deposits within asteroids.
“I see [exploring] space as a new way of thriving,” Hooper said after her presentation.
During the intermission, Yonatan Girma ’19 and Daniel S. Menz ’19 listed Hooper’s presentation as being among the “most provocative.”
“She made [platinum mining] not seem far-fetched,” Girma said. “That someone so young is implementing these ideas—that’s incredible.”
In the second half of the event, poet and Radcliffe fellow Sarah Howe performed a poem exploring individual and national identity, and war photojournalist Eman Mohammed spoke about her work documenting the intersection of pain and hope.
Harvard Business School professor Michael I. Norton, meanwhile, challenged the audience to think about wealth distribution. Norton’s previous TED talk has attracted nearly 3 million views.
Concluding the event, Haigh said, “We hope you’ve been galvanized to act in 2050.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s campus welcomed about 250 delegates from the Ivy League and all over the world this past weekend at the 16th annual Ivy Leadership Summit hosted by the intercollegiate, student-run Ivy Council.
At the conference, longtime leaders in the sphere of international relations encouraged Ivy League students to pursue civic engagement roles on their college campuses in preparation for becoming the next generation of socially responsible leaders. Students interacted with their peers and heard different perspectives on student leadership.
Hugo Yen ’18, one of the summit’s co-organizers, said its two goals this year were fostering strong inter-Ivy relations and building up Ivy-international relations.
“Talking to all these different people who have different experiences, it’s so cool to think that even similar classmates have different perspectives,” Mary Agajanian ’19 said. “It’s like there’s diversity within Harvard, then there’s diversity within the Ivy League.”
Dan Rosensweig, CEO of Chegg, was the first keynote speaker of the day. The high spirits in the hall were palpable as he spoke, sharing his life story and encouraging students to own their individual paths.
Emphasizing individuality in leadership, Rosensweig said students who aspire to found a company “have to believe in something like no one else does.”
Rosensweig, who has experience conducting business overseas, described the importance of respecting other cultures during negotiations.
“[He] taught us to be a genuine person when you negotiate, especially in international relations because that is the thing that everyone of every culture responds to,” said Julia Lin, a sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania.
The main keynote speaker, Edward Perkins, the first black ambassador to South Africa who worked with Nelson Mandela after apartheid, commented on leadership values in foreign policy and civil service.
Perkins said successful foreign policy requires bridging the communication gaps that exist between cultures, which can be done through education, specifically in history and language.
“You are in a perfect position now to study,” Perkins said. “Speaking, reading, writing— it’s important to be able to talk to anybody in the world through some kind of language—whether it’s the language of agriculture or human rights.”
Planning for the event began early October and the organizers were supported by the Leadership Institute, the Undergraduate Council, and College-100, which was responsible for providing a network of leading professionals as potential speakers. Organizers struggled to find housing for an unexpected influx of conference participants in the days leading up to the summit.
“It was exciting to meet so many people from different schools...to make those connections, create those friendships, and work toward future goals together,” said Oksana Prys, a Columbia junior.

Counselors at the Bureau of Study Counsel, the College’s Office of BGLTQ Student Life, and College peer counseling groups—unless legally compelled—will not disclose undergraduate reports of sexual harassment to a University Title IX coordinator or third party without the student’s permission. 
These groups recently have been added to a list of confidential resources available to members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Discussions about this change began this summer in response to student privacy concerns, University Title IX Officer Mia Karvonides wrote in a statement through University spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga.
Last month, administrators detailed those “confidential resources” in a supplementary Frequently Asked Questions document clarifying Harvard’s Title IX policies, published in the wake of the release of the University’s spring sexual conduct climate survey.
Without student permission, the BSC, BGLTQ office, and peer counseling groups will not share “information students tell them with others at Harvard” or third parties, Karvonides wrote in an email.
“Certainly, these groups will encourage the student to access the supports and make the connection to the [Title IX] Coordinator,” she added.
Under Title IX, some Harvard affiliates must share reports of sexual harassment with the University. The College’s residential tutors and proctors, for example, must disclose sexual assault reports to a University Title IX coordinator, according to the Title IX FAQs. School-specific Title IX coordinators serve as liaisons to the University’s central Title IX office.
Unlike other confidential reporting services, such as the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response’s rape crisis counselors and University mental health clinicians, counselors at the BSC, BGLTQ office, and College peer counseling groups are not legally privileged resources. This means that staff of those groups still may be required to share information in some circumstances, including “an external investigation, such as a criminal prosecution, civil lawsuit, or other government investigation,” according to the Title IX FAQs.
BSC counselors or BGLTQ officials could also share student information if a student faced “clear and present danger to self or others,” according to the BSC’s website. Information could also be disclosed if the reported perpetrator is a repeat offender, said Ann Gaylin, the College’s associate dean of undergraduate education for academic support.
Administrators said the change came in response to student concerns about privacy and that they hope the confidential resources will encourage more students to seek assistance.
“We have heard from Harvard College students that we need additional spaces on campus designated as confidential in order to reduce barriers for those seeking help,” Van Bailey, the head of the College’s BGLTQ office, wrote in an email.
The BSC’s designation as a confidential resource in the FAQs document comes after the office moved from the purview of Harvard University Health Services back to reporting administratively to the College, a change that provoked privacy concerns from undergraduates last semester. Some students worried that the confidentiality guaranteed by academic privacy laws would not be as strong as the protections of health privacy laws.
“It seemed appropriate to continue to treat these resources as confidential within the College to better serve its students,” Karvonides wrote.
“The BSC and the College have worked together to respond to student concerns about confidentiality, and the new BSC policies offer students greater privacy than that afforded by [the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act] alone (although not the level of privileged confidentiality provided by licensed professionals),” BSC Director Abigail Lipson wrote in an email last month.
College officials are forming an Office of Undergraduate Education student advisory board, which they say will give students a platform for input in administrative decisions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ahead of a Monday night deadline, two referendums that students have proposed adding to the ballot in next week’s Undergraduate Council election have not yet solicited the required number of student signatures.
While one proposed referendum calling for greater student input in Harvard’s sexual assault policy task force meetings has gathered more than the 670 signatures necessary to make it to the ballot, two others—including one asking if the College should limit student participation in all-male final clubs—have not.
At the Council’s general meeting on Sunday, UC Rules Committee Chair Brett M. Biebelberg ’16 said the final club referendum question had acquired only 280 signatures as of Sunday at 5 p.m., while a question attempting to ban meetings from happening over breakfast has only garnered 114 signatures.
This month’s presidential election ballot will also feature a referendum question asking students if the Pusey Library should “be transformed into a freshmen-oriented social space.” Supporters of that question, which will automatically appear on the ballot because UC representatives voted to fast-track it last week, claim that the library’s location in Harvard Yard would provide freshmen with a social space some students say they lack.
Also at Sunday’s meeting, the Council discussed whether to approve a grant request from organizers of a TEDx Harvard event that took place on Saturday. 
Winthrop House representative Daniel R. Levine ’17, was hesitant about the UC funding the event. He said the event was unreasonably priced, at $25 per student ticket.
Following Levine’s comments, UC Treasurer Meghamsh Kanuparthy ’16 proposed an amendment to the UC grants legislation, which usually passes with little opposition. The amendment would permit him to ask organizers whether an event generated a profit and let the Council’s executive board review the funding.
Kanuparthy’s amendment was adopted into the final legislation, which ultimately passed with six abstentions and one no-vote from Levine, who is also a former Crimson news writer.

The Harvard men’s swimming team won its first meet of the season over Bryant, 165-120, on Friday. The Crimson set the tone with a one-two-three-four finish in the 200-yard medley relay, the first race of the night, and never looked back.
On paper, Friday night in Blodgett Pool meant nothing in terms of record or standing. In many of the races, the entirety of the Harvard (1-0, 0-0 Ivy) contingent touched the wall before the Bryant (4-2) swimmers. But the meet was valuable in that it offered a reality check on the Crimson swimmers’ progress.
“The Bryant meet provided a great opportunity for everyone on the team to see the results of the intense training we’ve been doing over the past few months, as well as getting to race and determine areas where we can improve for our upcoming meets,” junior Eric Ronda said.
In addition, the meet also gave the Crimson swimmers something that practice couldn’t give them—the structure and strategy that comes in a meet.
“The Bryant meet served as an opportunity for us to practice our racing strategy in a different environment,” co-captain Christian Yeager said.
Harvard swimmers finished first 10 times out of the 16 events. In five of the six events that Bryant did win, Crimson swimmers posted times in exhibition swims that would have placed first in the scored competition.
“It was a meet where many guys swam events they aren’t used to swimming and still performed well, which shows the depth of our current team,” Ronda said.
On a young team with 10 freshmen, the Crimson swimmers were put into new situations to prepare them for the pressure of Ivy meets.
“We were able to have guys swim events they wouldn't likely swim at our Ivy dual meets,” Yeager said. “We were also able to have a lot of the guys who usually won't be put in scoring positions have an opportunity to score some points and swim in the middle of the pool.”
As always, there were a few standouts from Friday night’s meet. Sophomore Shane McNamara, best known for his performances in breaststroke, won the 1000 freestyle. Senior Leo Lim won the 200 butterfly.
It took 47.09 seconds for senior Evan Zheng to win the 100 free in which freshman Alan Lam, who usually swims longer distance freestyle, finished second.
Sophomore Ed Kim was perhaps the standout of the night, as he led off the 400 freestyle relay at at 45.27 second clip.
“Even though at this point in the season our cycle of training is meant to break us down as much as possible physically, there were still very solid swims from some members of our team,” Yeager said.
When it came down to it, the Crimson’s opening dual meet was like a quiz before the exam of Ivy play. Harvard passed the test, exhibiting its strength in depth and versatility.
The crux of the Crimson’s schedule is still to come, with Ivy League meets in the coming weeks, but Harvard laid down a marker for progress on Friday night.
“Based on our current training, I would say that our team is in very good position for the upcoming Ivy League meets,” Ronda said. “If we can continue our focus inside and outside the pool, this year should be a very good year for us.”
While there is a great belief in the training, there is a strong sense of togetherness about this team, which will be important in the upcoming weeks.
“The competition gets stronger every year, but I feel that our team chemistry and work ethic is as strong as ever,” Yeager said. “And we'll be ready to compete against teams in the Ivy League and also perform well nationally.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Midge Purce sent the Harvard women’s soccer team’s five seniors out in style as the junior forward’s goal in the 52nd minute lifted Harvard to a 1-0 win over Columbia on Saturday's Senior Day. It was the team’s fourth straight win at Rocko B. Commisso Soccer Stadium in New York.
“I think in practice this week we were really trying to focus on just keeping the ball and not trying to force it because we really wanted to play our game and connect and keep possession, and I think that’s what opened things up for us,” senior Emily Mosbacher said.
It was the final collegiate contest for co-captain Haley Washburn, midfielder Brooke Dickens, defender Alika Keene, and forwards Mosbacher and Lauren Varela. The Crimson (8-7-2, 5-1-1 Ivy) entered Saturday’s contest assured of a second-place Ivy League finish behind Princeton while the Lions (7-8-1, 3-3-1) were vying for sole possession of third place in the conference.
After Harvard was shut out in the first half for the 12th time this season, Purce gathered a pass from sophomore midfielder Dani Stollar and beat Columbia senior goalkeeper Gabbi Dubick to give Harvard the only goal it would need. Stollar, the reigning Ivy League Rookie of the Year, picked up her second assist of the season.
It was the ninth goal of the season and the sixth in Ivy League play for Purce, who is battling Princeton junior forward Tyler Lussi for Ivy League Player of the Year honors. The nine goals overall are the fewest Purce has had over her Crimson career, but the junior leads Harvard in virtually every offensive category and set a career high in shots.
The Crimson dominated the game offensively, despite registering just the one goal. The defense held its fifth different Ivy League opponent scoreless this season. Backup goalkeeper Danielle Etzel tallied her first career shutout and only had to make one save all afternoon.
Purce and classmate Rachel Garcia spearheaded the Harvard offensive attack as they have for most of the season. The duo combined for 16 shots, including seven on goal. The team peppered Dubick with 11 shots on goal, which was tied for the most the team has had in a game this season.
The Crimson’s backline of Dickens, Keene, and junior Bailey Gary and sophomore Marie Becker conceded just two shots on Saturday, with only one reaching Etzel. For the season, the defense did not allow more than two goals in any one game and only conceded three goals in Ivy League play.
“We focused on defending as a whole team,” Dickens said. “From the forwards to the midfield to the defense to the goalkeeper, we had this mindset that we were going to defend together. It’s really great because all the people in front of you are working just as hard as you are.”
The defense was able to neutralize Lions’ freshman forward Emma Anderson, who is fourth in the Ivy League in conference goals, to zero shots. Harvard has won its last eight contests against Columbia, the longest current streak for the Crimson against an Ivy League opponent.
Despite finishing the season with a record of 6-1-1 over its final eight games, Harvard likely will not play in postseason play for the first time in three years. Princeton will represent the Ivy League in the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2012, as the Tigers finished the season with a 6-0-1 record in conference play.
“It’s definitely really difficult to know that it’s your last game and to know that you won’t get to put on the Harvard jersey again,” Dickens said. “Harvard soccer has meant so much to me, so much to my teammates, but we know that this is an experience we’ll take with us the rest of our lives.”
The win was a fitting conclusion for one of the most successful classes in team history. The five seniors finished their careers with a record of 40-21-9 and picked up an NCAA Tournament victory last season, two Ivy League Championships, 21 goals and 21 assists along the way between them.
“It was so special to go out on a win,” Mosbacher said. “I’m so grateful for the whole team for giving one last win to the seniors. This experience has just been everything to me. It’s really been the pinnacle of my college experience.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a day when the ground game never got going, the Harvard football team resorted to the air.
In particular, senior quarterback Scott Hosch turned to his reliable duo of threats—one on his way out and the other just starting to make a name for himself.
Senior tight end Ben Braunecker and freshman wide receiver Justice Shelton-Mosley paced the Crimson throughout the contest, accounting for over two-thirds of the team’s total offense en route to a 24-16 victory over Columbia in New York.
Braunecker finished with 130 receiving yards, including a 53-yard touchdown catch on a corner route when his defender stumbled in coverage. A waltz into the end zone gave Harvard its first score of the day and capped a drive in which he recorded 75 receiving yards.
The senior’s play was noteworthy in its own right. But Shelton-Mosley still found a way to steal the show.
Demonstrating an explosiveness that has bedeviled opposing coverage units throughout the season, the freshman contributed 131 receiving yards, a 26-yard touchdown reception, and an 86-yard punt return for a score.
Shelton-Mosley showcased his ability to make defenders miss on both touchdowns. Late in the second quarter, Hosch found the wideout on a short look that seemed designed only to pick up a first down. But the freshman fooled two defenders with a sharp cut to the sideline and beat them to the pylon to give his team six points.
The punt return may have represented an even more impressive display. On the first play of the fourth quarter, Shelton-Mosley fielded a kick on his own 14-yard line. After nearly disappearing into a clump of bodies along the left sideline, the freshman broke two tackles and forced his way into the open field. He was gone, and the Crimson suddenly had a 24-3 lead.
Once again, Shelton-Mosley had created something out of nothing.
“He’s an explosive, dynamic kid that’s a legitimate Pac-12 player,” Columbia coach Al Bagnoli said. “That’s what you need. You need a couple of those guys that are different.”
In each of the season’s first seven games, Harvard finished with at least 100 yards of team rushing. On Saturday, the total was only 55.
With a struggling run game and the next highest receiver totaling just 37 yards, the burden fell to Shelton-Mosley and Braunecker to pick up the slack. With Shelton-Mosley leveraging his speed to spread the field and Braunecker finding holes in coverage through his physicality, Columbia had no answer for the duo all game.
AN ALL-NEW COLUMBIA
Featuring a new coach and redesigned uniforms, the 2015 version of Columbia (2-6, 1-4 Ivy) gave the Crimson (8-0, 5-0) a fight made all the more remarkable considering the program’s recent struggles.
Much of the responsibility for the turnaround likely rests with the former instead of the latter.
In the final three years of former Lions coach Pete Mangurian’s tenure, Harvard coasted to a trio of victories over the blue-and-white. The combined score: 148-0.
2015 marks the first season for Bagnoli, a longtime Penn head coach, at the helm of the Columbia program. Not only did the scoreless streak end, but the Lions also proved they could play with the best of the Ivy League.
With Harvard holding a 24-3 lead in the fourth quarter, the game seemed out of reach. Columbia, however, would not go down without a fight.
Lions quarterback Anders Hill waited out a blitz and connected with a wide-open Cameron Dunn for a 51-yard touchdown pass. Two Crimson three-and-outs later, Columbia capped a 68-yard drive with a three-yard strike to John Hunton in the front of the end zone on fourth down.
“I thought their offense greatly improved from last year,” Harvard captain Matt Koran said.
The score was suddenly 24-16. The Crimson would hang on, but not before receiving a scare. In addition to holding senior running back Paul Stanton to his lowest rushing total of the year, Columbia posted five more first downs than Harvard, 25 more yards of total offense, and won the time of possession battle.
The formerly lowly Lions gave the Crimson its second closest game of the season.
“They had a lot more fight in them, it seemed like this year,” Hosch said. “They really were stout in the run defense and just things like tackling. They were very sound fundamentally.”
MURPHY VS. BAGNOLI
In addition to representing Harvard’s 22nd consecutive victory, Saturday featured a battle between two of the most successful coaches in Ivy League history.
Crimson coach Tim Murphy and Bagnoli have faced off every year since Murphy took over in Cambridge in 1994. Bagnoli, who captured nine championships in his 23 seasons with Penn, has a 12-10 record against Murphy.
Saturday’s victory pushed Murphy to 109 career Ivy wins, good for third place all-time—and just four behind Bagnoli.
“We’ve always had great mutual respect, obviously been locking horns for a couple of decades plus,” Murphy said. “It was a little weird seeing him in Columbia blue initially, but they’ve already had an impact…. They’ve got the kids believing.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After scoring early and often, the Harvard women’s ice hockey team was able to finish its weekend road trip with victories against Yale and Brown.
Having played many close games to start the year, including a 2-1 loss to Dartmouth in its season opener, the No. 9/9 Crimson (3-1-1, 3-1-1 ECAC) was looking to make a statement to solidify its position going forward in a still-early season. Harvard did exactly that by besting Yale (1-4-1, 1-2-0) and Brown (0-6-0, 0-4-0) on the road, 3-2 and 5-1, respectively.
HARVARD 5, BROWN 1
While the Crimson was unable to completely set itself apart from Yale after heading out to an early lead on Friday, the narrative was slightly different against the Bears, as Harvard rode its offense to a definitive victory in Providence, R.I.
After a scoreless, back and forth first period, Harvard owned the rest of the contest. Goals by junior forward Sydney Daniels, sophomore forward Lexie Laing, freshman forward Audrey Warner, and junior defender Briana Mastel led the Crimson to a 4-0 advantage by 4:19 in the third.
The offensive prowess was on display throughout the latter half of the contest as well, as Harvard took 46 shots on the evening with 19 of those attempts coming in the third period alone.
“We got a lot of different scores, which is a lot of fun to see,” co-captain Michelle Picard said. “Just getting offense from a lot of different people in lines, defense, forwards, everyone…. It’s good to know that we can generate offense from anybody and we don’t have to rely on any specific person.”
Harvard played stout defense when tested on its two penalty kills in the competition. The Crimson, on the other hand, was able to turn that around on Brown to make the most of its lone power play opportunity on the weekend with Mastel’s score.
A late Bears goal by Sam Donovan spoiled junior goalie Molly Tissenbaum’s opportunity for a clean sheet, but Harvard finished strong. The Crimson were able to cap off the game with just seconds left in the match with an empty net score by freshman defender Kate Hallett after Brown pulled its goalie.
HARVARD 3, YALE 2
Harvard kicked off the trip Friday night in New Haven against the Bulldogs. The Cambridge contingent started off strong, as Daniels put her team in the lead 5:29 into the first period with her first goal of the season to give the Crimson the lead. Two scores by freshman forward Grace Zarzecki in the second stanza, the first goals of her Crimson career, widened the gap even further while the game was still young.
Although seemingly in the driver’s seat at this point in the game, Harvard could not pull away from its rivals.
The Crimson committed penalties that led to five power play opportunities for the Bulldogs. Harvard’s defense held firm, however, as it stifled any attempt by the opposition to pull closer during penalty kills to finish the two game set without a blemish over seven such challenges.
“We had a lot of penalties this weekend against us, but we killed them off grit, so our [penalty kills] are rolling really well,” Picard said. “We have a lot of confidence in that. Obviously, we don’t want to get penalties, but if we do, we know that we can kill them.”
The Crimson’s defense eventually did crack, however, as the Bulldogs’ Phoebe Staenz was finally able to get the puck past junior goalie Brianna Laing early in the third period. Another goal in garbage time with 13 seconds left in the contest set the final score.
Although Yale produced a solid, penalty free offensive outing with 28 shots to Harvard’s 21, Laing’s 26 saves contributed greatly to Harvard’s defensive effort, helping to pull out a close victory.
“I think it’s really impressive the way [Laing] played,” senior forward Miye D’Oench said. “It’s tough to not get a lot of ice time and when it’s your turn to step up and play…. It wasn’t easy, and she made huge saves for us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first time in four years, the seniors on the Harvard women’s volleyball team have no more games left at the Malkin Athletic Center. The senior class, which helped the team a 56-38 record over the past four years, played its final two matches at Harvard this weekend.
And just as the four seniors emerged victorious in their first game in the MAC in 2012, so did they on Friday and Saturday. Led by co-captains Caroline Holte and Hannah Schmidt, the Crimson (13-9, 9-3 Ivy) swept both games this weekend, beating conference opponents Columbia (7-14, 5-7) and Cornell (6-16, 2-10) in straight sets.
“It doesn’t really feel like it’s over because we have another weekend,” senior libero Sindhu Vegesena said. “We’re going to take tonight to celebrate, but come Monday, we’re going back to the gym...getting ready to wrap it up.”
HARVARD 3, COLUMBIA 0
Columbia’s fan section filled the MAC with boisterous chants early in Saturday’s matchup.
But after the first few points, the cheering quickly died down.
Upon dropping to a 4-3 deficit early in the first set, the Lions did not pull even with the Crimson again until the third set. The final period was characterized by the two squads trading points early, Columbia gaining their first lead since their 3-2 advantage in the opening minutes of play at 9-8.
However, the last-ditch comeback effort was effectively stopped with a 7-2 run in the third period, capped off by senior outside hitter Kathleen Wallace’s huge kill to put the Crimson up 15-11. In her fifth double-double of the season, Wallace led the team in kills with 12, nearly doubling the next highest total. She also was second in digs with 12 behind Vegesena’s 15.
The play of the seniors highlighted the game. Just over 43 percent of the team’s 62 digs came at the hands of Vegesena and Wallace, and Schmidt was second on the team in assists with 16. Holte finished the game with seven kills.
“We played really well. We worked hard in practice and tried to add a few things to our offense and defense,” Harvard coach Jennifer Weiss said. “The seniors stepped it up [and] had a really good weekend. Everybody...did what they’re supposed to do. It’s just great when they get a rhythm.”
Junior setter Corie Bain was a dig away from a double-double with nine and a team-high 18 assists. Freshmen middle blockers Christina Cornelius and Jocelyn Meyer had identical stat lines with seven kills and four block assists each.
HARVARD 3, CORNELL 0
Down 24-21 at the near the end of the third set, the Crimson fought back against the Big Red to win five straight points and clinch their first Ivy League win since losing to Princeton on Halloween. The entire set was traded back and forth between the two teams with nine ties and three lead changes throughout.
A 9-0 run early in the second set proved to be a catalyst for Harvard, as Cornell was not able to gain a lead or tie the game until the third set.
“All the Ivy matches are so close,” Weiss said. “So they did a good job of working hard all week and putting some new things into our system.”
Vegesena was solid defensively with a team-high 13 digs, bringing her season total to 382. She is only 25 digs away from the highest single-season total of her career with a pair of weekend games remaining. The Harvard attack was balanced throughout the contest as well, as Wallace, Cornelius, and Bain tied for the team lead with seven kills. Bain added a double-double with her 18 assists and 10 digs.
“We did great,” Vegensena said. “I think it shows in the scores. We beat both teams in three. We came back against Cornell in the third set. It was 24-21, and we came back to win 26-24…. We fought hard.”
Harvard now enters the last weekend of the season with a one-game lead over two other teams in the Ivy League.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Facing Brown for the third year in a row, the Harvard women’s rugby team could not replicate the outcome of its historic inaugural varsity season only two years ago. For the second straight year, the Crimson (4-4, 3-2 Ivy) allowed the Bears 27 points in a repeat of last year’s first round matchup. The team allowed four tries en route to a 27-17 loss.
Also in a repeat of last year’s matchup for third place, the Crimson took on Princeton on Sunday. Despite a close matchup that came down to a single try, Harvard could not find the try zone late and did not repeat last year's third place finish.
Earlier in the season, Harvard beat the Tigers, 17-0, at home.
“Obviously both games were very close, and we lost both. Those were both games we could’ve won,” co-captain Hope Schwartz said. “It’s disappointing to have a performance like that and to know that we matched up well against those teams but couldn’t pull out the win.”
PRINCETON 17, HARVARD 12
In its second matchup of the weekend, the Crimson faced a Princeton (3-4, 3-4) squad it beat in the final seconds earlier this year. Harvard started the match off with a quick try from freshman Caitlin Weigel, but following that, the Crimson found itself in a position it hadn’t been in all season.
“We lost two impact players near the beginning of the game and had to rally and try to keep things together without them,” Harvard coach Sue Parker said. “I think many players stepped up to try to help us do that, but it just wasn’t quite enough.”
Losing possession after being forced out of bounds, Harvard gave up a try to tie the game at five. After a scoring drought that ensued into the second half, Princeton took the lead with a try and conversion. Off an unsuccessful Crimson scrum, the Tigers would score again to take a 17-5 lead.
Harvard would close the gap to five with a try from freshman Sarah Lipson and successful conversion, but would fail to score in the last 10 minutes as the Crimson lost, 17-12.
Despite finishing fourth in the tournament, Schwartz was positive about the opportunity to play again when the Varsity Cup rolls around in two weeks.
“We are coming out of this tournament incredibly disappointed in our performance, and because of that, I think it’s a gift that the season is not yet over and that we have another chance to prove ourselves,” Schwartz said. “Our hope for season is that we use these next games as an opportunity to prove what we couldn’t prove this weekend.”
BROWN 27, HARVARD 17
In its first matchup of the weekend, the Crimson struggled to find its footing after Brown (6-3, 4-1) jumped out to a quick 17-0 lead in the semifinals. The Bears scored two tries and a conversion within the first twenty minutes of the match to take a 12-point advantage.
“We gave up two quick tries early on in the game, and then after that it was a very even match between the teams, but we weren’t able to make up the deficit we had given up at the beginning of the game,” Parker said.
With four minutes left in the half, Harvard put itself on the board when Weigel made a break and handed the ball over to sophomore Haley Langan for the Crimson’s first try of the day. The half would end 17-5 in Brown’s favor.
“I think that both teams defenses were extremely determined to not just stop the other team from scoring but getting the ball back which is why there was a lot of back and forth of possession,” Parker said. “Neither team had significant periods of time in that middle stretch of the game where they had continuity of possession so they could score.”
In the second half, Harvard found itself in a defensive stalemate with the Bears. Following a long kick from freshman Susie Clements and a try from Weigel, the Crimson climbed within five.
Brown extended its lead with another try and conversion to take the 24-12 lead, but Harvard again responded with a try to pull the score within seven at 22-17. That was as close the Crimson would get.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a tournament filled with strong performances, the Harvard men’s water polo team (19-9, 9-3 CWPA Northern) came up just short when it counted most.
The team traveled to Providence, R.I., this weekend for the CWPA Northern Division Championship. The Crimson brushed aside Connecticut College in the opening round before downing St. Francis Brooklyn later in the day, but fell to Brown (23-6, 12-0) in sudden death overtime in the final by a narrow 14-13 score.
“I think that even though we lost, the determination and the fight that we had are obvious,” senior two-meter guard Dan Stevens said. “I think that grit is going to get us through these next two weeks with the determination that says, ‘We are capable of beating any team that we play.’”
BROWN 14, HARVARD 13
Of the 13 matchups between the Crimson and the Bears over the last three years, six have come down to two points or fewer. Nearly every game between the two teams comes down to the wire, and Sunday’s final epitomized that relationship clearly.
On Sunday, Brown held the lead at the end of each of the first three periods but could not stop the Crimson from tying it up each time the Bears attempted to pull away.
With just over a minute left to play and Brown up, 10-8, Harvard stormed back yet again as sophomore utilityman Colin Chiapello cut the lead in half, and senior attacker Austin Lee equalized in the last three seconds of the game.
Then with the contest forced into overtime, Harvard overcame another two-goal deficit, with Lee producing yet another game-tying goal—this time with one second on the clock.
The game advanced to sudden death overtime, leaving the Crimson without margin for error. But Bears sophomore utility Jake Wyatt scored two minutes into the period to give Brown the title over the Crimson for the second year in a row.
Despite the loss, by reaching the title game, Harvard secured a spot in the CWPA championship, which begins on Nov. 20.
“Our ultimate goal is to win a CWPA championship,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “We’re going to get back to work tomorrow and get ready for whoever that first team is in front of us.”
HARVARD 13, ST. FRANCIS BROOKLYN 8
St. Francis’s offense has given Harvard trouble all season, and the semifinal match in Providence on Saturday was no exception.
The Terrier attackers kept the score within three points through the first three quarters of the game and looked dangerous throughout, but Harvard freshman goalie Anthony Ridgley made nine saves to keep the Terriers (14-12, 8-4) out of the game.
“I’m most proud of the way we played defense this weekend,“ Minnis said. “We kept [St. Francis] under 10 goals, and when we do that, we usually do well.”
Bolstered by strong play at the back, the Crimson eventually pulled away with steady attacking play. Lee and co-captain two-meter Ben Zepfel each notched three goals to help Harvard advance to the final game on Sunday.
The victory improved the Crimson’s win streak to 10 games, tying the program record.
HARVARD 20, CONNECTICUT COLLEGE 9
In its first game of the weekend, Harvard faced a familiar opponent and came away with a familiar result. The Crimson rode one of its most dominant offensive performances of the season to an easy win over Connecticut College (1-18, 0-6) in the opening round, 20-9.
The decision was Harvard’s third victory over the Camels this season and stretches the Crimson’s record against Connecticut College to 20-0 over the last ten years.
Senior driver Paul MacMullin chipped in three goals and an assist to help the Camels put up a fight after Harvard took an early 10-3 lead, but the effort was not enough to counter the surging Harvard offense.
When the final whistle blew, four Crimson players had tallied hat tricks.
“Our offense has been pretty consistently good throughout the season,” Stevens said. “They do a good job of getting through to goal and creating good opportunities for teammates.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With its back against the wall and needing a victory—along with some help elsewhere—to retain its hopes of claiming the Ivy League title, the Harvard men’s soccer team (8-6-2, 4-2-0 Ivy) snapped a two-game conference losing streak by defeating Columbia (9-5-1, 3-3-0), 2-0.
Senior forward Michael Innocenzi notched his first career brace to ruin the Lions’ senior day in a game dominated by set piece opportunities.
“It was a classic Ivy League game that can come down to a lot of set pieces and long throws,” senior defender Philip Fleischman said. “Fortunately we were able to capitalize on two of those.”
The game started off tediously, with neither side threatening much in the first frame. The two sides combined for a mere two shots and were forced to depend mostly on corners and set pieces.
Both sides came to life in the second stanza, however, combining for a total of 13 shots—six by Columbia and seven by the Crimson. Harvard got off to an attacking start, managing three shots in the first 15 minutes, and broke through just over 20 minutes into the half.
After winning a corner in the 62nd minute, sophomore midfielder Sam Brown whipped the ball into the box as Innocenzi ran on to meet it. The senior then managed to latch on with his head and redirect the ball past Columbia netminder Kyle Jackson for his third goal of the season.
Innocenzi was back to his scoring ways a mere seven minutes later off another set piece as classmate Tim Schmoll found the forward inside the box. The Franklin Lakes, N.J., native nodded it past Jackson once again using his head, doubling his side’s advantage.
“I tried to take advantage of the game plan,” Innocenzi said. “We had put some good balls in the box, and I happened to be at the end of two of those. I’d say it was more preparing for the game and really executing the gameplan more than anything.”
Columbia did not go down easily, however, as the Lions offense sprung to life in the closing 10 minutes of the game. Crimson captain Evan Mendez was called to duty, as the Lions forced him into three saves in the final 10 minutes of play, preserving the fifth shutout of the year for Harvard.
Despite the victory, Harvard’s slim chances of claiming a share of the Ancient Eight title were laid to rest, as Dartmouth defeated Cornell, 2-0, earlier in the day to claim its second straight conference crown.
While the Crimson is no longer able to sit atop the Ivy, the team believes it still has a chance to qualify for the NCAA tournament. Thus, the team will look to improve its tournament resume with a win in its final game of the regular season against Penn next weekend.
“Our goal is still to win a national championship, and we still have a shot at qualifying [for] the NCAA tournament,” Fleischman said. “So there’s everything to play for going into this final game against Penn…. We want to give ourselves the best chance of getting an at-large-bid.”
Harvard’s final game will take place at home next Saturday on the Crimson’s Senior Day, where eleven seniors will be honored.
Though only time will tell if this weekend marks the last time the class of 2016 will walk onto Jordan Field donning crimson, the seniors are confident they will leave the program in a good place for the future.
“Our coaches are great, and we’re getting a good recruiting class.” Innocenzi said. “Obviously we lose 10 seniors so that’s a hit, but we have a good class coming up, and we really pride ourselves on being a team of leaders…. The guys will really feel motivated since we’ve come so close the last three years.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a public exhibition game Saturday afternoon, the Harvard men’s basketball team struggled to dispatch McGill, surviving as a Jenning Leung desperation three clanked of the rim. Instead of heading to overtime, the Crimson walked away from Lavietes Pavilion with a 66-63 victory.
Junior forward Zena Edosomwan set the tempo for the team, finishing the afternoon with 21 points and 11 rebounds. By the end of the first half, Edosomwan had scored 18 of the team’s 39 points, with the next closest player notching only four.
A span of five possessions defined the pattern.
On two consecutive Harvard possessions, Edosomwan lost the ball in the paint and on both occasions, McGill (7-4) capitalized and turned Edosomwan’s mistakes into points, putting the visitors up 22-19.
Edosomwan then regained his composure and hit three straight layups on Harvard’s next three possessions to regain the lead. This was a trend throughout the game—when Edosomwan was on, so was Harvard.
McGill also found first-half success in the paint. The visitors’ speed advantage over Harvard pulled the Crimson frontcourt out towards the perimeter, leaving a gap in the paint for McGill to find the open player. Edosomwan and Cummins credited the Crimson’s issues on defense to miscommunication and over-helping.
“I thought they were getting really easy slips, they were getting open for threes [as there was] miscommunication on switches or picks or flares, so I think we just have to do a better job on that aspect, making sure we’re just talking on defense,” Edosomwan said.
The second half saw a different Edosomwan. While he dropped 18 in the first half, he tallied only three points in the second. But he was still able to contribute—snagging eight of his 11 rebound in the second frame.
“I think, obviously this year, the team is going to look to me a lot to score, but it’s not all about scoring,” Edosomwan said. “I felt better about my rebounding in the second half compared to the first... I need to be more of a factor on the glass, and those little things are going to help the team.”
The pressure on Edosomwan is especially strong after the Crimson lost senior Siyani Chambers to injury at the beginning of the year. With Edosomwan shouldering the scoring burden, freshman guard Tommy McCarthy took the pressure at the point.
Though junior guards Corbin Miller and Matt Fraschilla have been expected to compete for time at point, Miller spent most of his time at his traditional shooting guard position and Fraschilla sat for the first 35 minutes of the game.
In the second half, the Crimson adjusted its defensive strategy to accommodate for its first-half weaknesses in the paint. But McGill responded and adjusted its offensive plan. After Harvard built up an 11-point lead seven minutes into the second frame, McGill nailed three unanswered three-pointers to pull the defcit back within two.
With the quartet of guards—Fraschilla, Miller, McCarthy and freshman Corey Johnson—all in the game in the waning minutes, Amaker put in a smaller lineup to keep up with McGill’s speed in the backcourt. He needed his defense to keep McGill from scoring from deep—a strength they showed throughout the contest.
“We really just tried to match [sizes], thinking we could see if we could somehow not...give up a penetrate and pitch kind of three-point shot,” Amaker said. “Then they threw it inside and got the basket, but we didn’t give them an and-one, and we certainly didn’t give them the three-point shot, which is really what we were guarding against.”
But the Crimson would not have been in this must-stop position had it cashed in on free throw chances throughout the game. McGill committed nearly twice as many fouls as Harvard, but the Crimson shot only 57 percent from the charity stripe.
The tight contest forced the young Crimson team to learn to play under pressure. Though it was an exhibition, for a trio of players—McCarthy, Johnson, and freshman forward Weisner Perez—this was their first time competing in a real game setting.
“[McGill is] a good basketball team, and it was a good test for us.” Amaker said. “We got to do, obviously, a lot of different things to figure out how to win a game like that for our young team. I’m very hopeful that those kinds of lessons will serve us well as we move forward.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Every athlete hopes to end his or her career on a high note.
The Harvard women’s field hockey forward and co-captain Elizabeth Jacobson did just that.
The senior scored twice as the Crimson (9-8, 4-3 Ivy) finished off its season with a comprehensive 5-0 win over Columbia (9-8, 3-4) on Sunday afternoon.
“It felt really nice,” Jacobson said. “Having the support of the team, with everyone playing so well, was great. The passes from the backfield set me up perfectly, so I couldn’t have done it without my team. It was an amazing way to end the season, and end my career.”
Jacobson’s brace put her at 13 goals on the year, a career-high that ties her for fourth in the Ivy League. Her first goal, just 2:21 into the second half, doubled the lead to 2-0 and gave Harvard some breathing room. Her second, the result of a well-worked one-two with junior forward Marissa Balleza, came just eight minutes later and effectively buried the Lions.
“[Elizabeth] has been fantastic,” coach Tjerk van Herwaarden said. “She’s been great the whole season, and I think she showed her importance again today. She’s a huge part of our offensive plan… teams get confidence from having players like her, and she’s been a hugely valuable player for us the whole entire season.”
Balleza, who led the Crimson with 32 points this season, notched her 13th goal of the year to get the scoring started. Midway through the first half, she converted a penalty stroke to finally break down Columbia’s stubborn defense, opening the proverbial floodgates for the rest of the contest. The Severna Park, M.D. native—who led all Ivy League juniors in points this season—scored in five out of the squads’s seven Ancient Eight matchups this season, despite not being 100 percent healthy throughout much of the 17-game campaign.
“Marissa is a great, fantastic player for us,” van Herwaarden said. “She’s able to pick up the ball in midfield and shake defenders quite easily, scoring at decisive moments. Every single team we play knows her, is scared of her, and I think that makes her more valuable for the team.”
With the Lions trying to play catch-up for the rest of the game after Jacobson’s second made it 3-0, Harvard was able to capitalize on the resulting gaps in their defense. With just under ten minutes remaining, sophomore midfielder Hannah Wellington tacked on the Crimson’s fourth by redirecting junior forward Clare McClintock’s centering pass past Columbia goalkeeper Kimberly Pianucci.
Freshman forward Kathleen Young, named to the United States Under-19 national team this summer, added gloss to the scoreline with under 30 seconds remaining. The rookie smacked home a rebound to grab her fifth goal of the season and Harvard’s fifth and final tally of the game.
The defense, led by senior goalkeeper Issy Davies and co-captain defender Caroline Code, shut out Columbia’s attack in what was a full, disciplined 70-minute shift. Tasked with defending Lions senior Christina Freibott, second in the Ivy League with 35 points, the Crimson defense came out confident, limiting her to just two shots on goal. The Lion standout averaged more than two points per game on the year, even ate rbeing held scoreless on Sunday.
“Izzy stepped up,” said Van Herwaarden. “She is a tremendous goalkeeper, especially her reaction time. It makes her very special.”
Following last weekend’s 4-1 win over Dartmouth, the back-to-back victories put Harvard fourth in the conference and mark the first time the team has finished over .500 in back-to-back season since 2003-2004.
For the seniors—Jacobson, Davies, and Code among others—it ensures a positive end to their Harvard careers after a string of up-and-down seasons. After the senior class saw the team finish with sub-.500 records through their first two years, the senior class ended its career with the team with 10 and nine wins, respectively.
“Those losses were killer, but that’s what comes with the Ivy League,” Jacobson said. “You never know who’s gonna show up, and there were some bumps in the road, but we wanted to end the season on a high note. We, especially the seniors, knew we had to give everything… there was never a chance that we’d give up.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s tennis team played three nailbiting matches this past weekend at the Harvard Invitational. All three finished 4-3, and in a testament to the team’s clutch performance, all three ended as Crimson victories. It was just the way the team hoped to finish its fall season, as the team’s next match is not until January.
Syracuse, Pittsburgh, and Boston University all sent their squads to Cambridge to face off in the round-robin tournament, but it was ultimately Harvard that brought home the tournament’s crown.
Harvard 4, Boston University 3
The Crimson freshman trio of Isabel Jasper, Erica Oosterhout, and Sabrina Xiong found themselves in pressure situations at the end of the day on Sunday, as Harvard and BU were knotted 2-2 after the other singles matches finished in straight sets. In just the fifth tournament of their young careers, Jasper and Oosterhout headed into third sets against seniors, while Xiong was fighting a 6-2, 5-4 deficit against Terriers junior Barbara Rodriguez.
As Oosterhout and Jasper took breaks before their third sets, it was Xiong who set the tone for the rest of the day when she came back to top Rodriguez, 7-5. After fighting through several long rallies and fending off more than a few close calls, Xiong let out a yell of satisfaction as she walked back to the bench.
Her teammates heard, and soon followed her lead.
While Oosterhout defeated BU’s Johanna Hyoty, 6-1, 6-7 (2), 6-1, Jasper overcame another Terriers senior, Kim McCallum, 7-6 (0), 4-6, 6-3. Xiong ultimately lost her match to Rodriguez, but the Crimson still came away with the 4-3 victory overall.
“I’m really proud of how the freshmen stepped up the entire weekend,” Crimson coach Traci Green said. “It was important for them to get experience and see what it feels like to be in a team competition.”
Harvard 4, Syracuse 3
Unlike on Sunday, Harvard played from behind for most of the day against Syracuse after dropping the doubles point. Orange freshman Gabriela Knutson and junior Olivia Messineo combined to pick up the first win for their team, 8-6, and the duo of sophomore Nicole Mitchell and freshman Maria Tritou soon followed , topping the Harvard’s Jasper and Xiong, 8-5.
Once the singles matches began, however, the Crimson quickly picked up its play and grabbed two straight-sets victories. Junior Danielle Mirda overcame Messineo, 7-6 (2), 6-0, after a back-and-forth first set, while Harvard captain Amy He dispatched of Orange freshman Libi Mesh, 6-4, 6-1.
Syracuse kept pace, however, earning two straight-sets victories of their own. Down 3-2, Harvard was in the familiar position of having its back against the wall. Once again, the team delivered.
The comeback was punctuated by captain Amy He, who took the final two sets of her match against Orange freshman Maria Tritou, 7-5 and 6-4, after dropping the first, 2-6.
Harvard 4, Pittsburgh 3
Four of the six singles matches on Friday ended in straight sets, and as the two others entered a tiebreaking third set, the Crimson found itself trailing 3-2. The Crimson captain quickly knotted up the score with a 6-2 victory over Pitt freshman Gabriela Rezende, capping a 6-0, 6-7 (3), 6-2 win, and all eyes at the Murr Center turned to the final match of the day.
Oosterhout fittingly pulled out a dramatic 6-2, 4-6, 7-6 (8) win over Panthers junior Lolade Ogungbesan. For a while, it seemed as if the match would never end.
The close win capped a career day for Oosterhout, who recorded wins in both singles and doubles. Earlier in the day, the freshman and her junior partner June Lee triumphed over their opponents from Pitt, Ogungbesan and junior Amber Washington, 8-2.
While the Harvard duo of Mirda and Jasper were defeated, 8-3, the team was still able to come away with the doubles point when He, playing with Xiong, overcame Panthers freshmen Natsumi Okamoto and Carina Ma, 8-3.
“We saw a big improvement in doubles,” Lee said. “We’ve been working a lot on it and we were able to come away with the doubles point two of the three days here.”

The Harvard sailing team competed in three different regattas this weekend, highlighted by a second place finish at the ICSA Men’s Singlehanded National Championship from Crimson junior Juan Carlos Perdomo.
ICSA Singlehanded National Championship
With his silver medal finish, Perdomo became the highest placing member of the Harvard team at nationals since he finished in second at the same event during his freshman year.
Perdomo is the only male from Harvard in more than half a decade to even compete in nationals, and his two second place finishes mark him as one of the most successful singlehanded sailors in recent Crimson history.
“I’m pretty satisfied with how I did at nationals,” Perdomo said. “I obviously didn’t get first in the end, but I think I’m going to work on making fewer mistakes, and hopefully that’ll make me a better sailor in the coming years.”
First place went to sophomore Malcolm Lamphere of Yale, who defeated Perdomo by three points. Perdomo placed first in four out of the ten races—the most out of anyone on the field—but was limited by a 13th place finish in his first race.
Day one of the championships was marked by inconsistent weather and consistent penalties. Despite the optimistic forecast, the lack of wind ensured that only three races—which garnered five yellow cards—were conducted. The weather during day two, when the majority of the races were conducted, was markedly better, with winds ranging from 6-15 knots.
While Perdomo has his sights set on winning nationals next year, he is also looking towards even bigger goals.
“Next college season, I hope to win nationals and do one better,” Perdomo said. “But my big goal for next season is qualifying for the Olympics next summer.”
On the women’s side, Harvard sophomore Taylor Ladd finished 13th out of 18 competitors. Ladd was the first Crimson competitor at the event since 2009.
Ladd performed well in day one of competition -- placing second in one of the three races. However, she struggled a bit in day two, with her highest finish coming in eighth on the last race of the meet.
Hap Moore Team Race
Harvard finished ninth out of 12 teams at the Hap Moore Team Race, hosted by the U.S. Coast Guard Academy. The Crimson sent freshmen Nick DiGiovanni and Jackson Wagner and sophomore Nick Sertl as skippers, and juniors Priscilla Russo, Nomin-Erdene Jagdagdorj, and Olivia Kjorlien as crew.
Harvard went 8-8 in the round-robin, winning its last three races of the competition, on a weekend that featured unpredictable weather and dramatic wind shifts. Brown, who went 12-4, won the meet.
The Mike Horn Trophy
The Mike Horn regatta, hosted by Harvard, was marked by blustery weather—unusual for this time of year—with winds between seven and 15 knots and comfortable mid-60s temperatures. The strong breeze throughout the day presented some issues for the Crimson sailors, who were unaccustomed to such strong wind.
“We had been practicing in light breeze, not the heavy breeze where everyone’s fast,” Gavula said. “In the light wind, you’re fast only if you’re good at your maneuvers. We hadn’t had much experience in heavy breeze, so it was a little hard.”
Harvard sent sophomore Dylan Farrell, freshmen Taylor Gavula, and freshman Andrew Puopolo as skippers, and junior Emma Wheeler, freshman Christine Gosioco, and freshman Catherine Tang as crew.
The round-robin format, which is traditionally raced in the spring, was largely unfamiliar to the young Harvard team. The Crimson finished fifth out of six teams with a 3-7 record.
“It was a different type of sailing that I’d been doing all season, and we all really hadn’t had that much experience with it, so we didn’t do too great,” Gavula said. “But I saw the positive correlation between me attempting to do some moves that I hadn’t tried before and a better race outcome, so I think we learned a lot.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Freshman wide receiver Justice Shelton-Mosley earned Athlete of the Week honors by guiding Harvard football to a 24-16 win over Columbia on Saturday. The freshman wide receiver caught eight passes for 131 yards and added an 86-yard punt return for a touchdown in the fourth quarter. Aside from Shelton-Mosley’s impact on the gridiron, three other Crimson had crucial performances in their teams’ wins.
Jimmy Vesey, Men’s Ice Hockey
The co-captain scored twice and added an assist in Harvard’s 5-2 win over Brown at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center. This marked the 11th two-goal game in his career. In the first period, Vesey netted a shorthanded goal, and he tallied another in the second on a 3-on-2. The North Reading, Mass. native assisted Kyle Criscuolo on his third-period goal. Vesey’s three points equaled the team’s margin of victory in the win over the Bears, and his effort led the Crimson to its third win of the season. The senior forward is averaging a goal and an assist per game so far this year.
Michael Innocenzi, Men’s Soccer
The senior forward’s two goals proved to be the difference as Harvard beat Columbia, 2-0, on the road Saturday. In the 62nd minute, sophomore midfielder Sam Brown played a corner kick into the box, and Innocenzi was able to guide the ball past the keeper to give the Crimson its first goal of the contest. Later in the second half, Innocenzi doubled Harvard’s lead with another header off a pass from senior midfielder Tim Schmoll. These two goals marked the first brace of Innocenzi’s four-year career at Harvard. In 16 games played this season, the Franklin Lakes, N.J. native has four goals, including two game-winning goals.
Karly Heffernan, Women’s Ice Hockey
Over the weekend, Heffernan recorded four assists in two Crimson wins, extending the team’s current winning streak to three. In the Crimson’s 3-2 win over Yale, the sophomore forward assisted on both of freshman forward Grace Zarzecki’s goals. The next day, Heffernan picked up another pair of assists in Harvard’s defeat of Brown, 5-1. After the two weekend games, Heffernan increased her point streak to three games, and she has tallied all of her season-total five assists during that span. In six games this year, the native of Sherwood Park, Alberta has six points, including one goal.

To the seasoned Harvard-Yale game attendee, the question of where to stay is no big deal. But to freshmen who don’t know any Yalies, there has been some concern over finding a place to crash.
Harvard Houses and Yale residential colleges are matched together as “sister houses” to coordinate which common spaces students can sleep in. As of 2005, freshmen dorms were added to the mix, so freshmen can rest assured that they wouldn’t be sleeping out on the mean streets of New Haven.
Looking back at his freshman year experience, Lijia Xie ’17 remembers some of the logistical challenges associated with H-Y.
“There definitely were people who didn’t have anywhere to go at first and didn’t realize until they got to New Haven,” said Xie.
Xie’s friends ended up finding accommodations once there, either by latching onto friends staying with Yale students, or by sleeping in common living spaces through the sister house match-up.
“If you need to stay in one of the common spaces, I’d probably try to find a [Harvard] friend to stay together with,” he said.
Student groups also offer the opportunity to match up students. One example is the Harvard African Students Association, which partners with the Yale African Students Association. Students can fill out a Google form and get matched with a Yale student.
So freshmen, don’t fret. If you want to go to the game, there’s a futon or floor spot with your name on it.

Following a tip from a student on the disappearance of honey butter in upperclassmen dining halls, Flyby felt like it had a moral obligation to investigate further; but first, I had to figure out what “honey butter” is.
“Isn’t it just putting honey on butter?” I asked my freshmen friends.
Unfortunately, I had no luck with my inquiries: none of them had the answer. However, Aracely E. Aguirre ’17 described it as “honey mixed with butter…[that] just melts in your mouth.” My exhaustive research seems to confirm this, with a reviewer on Allrecipes.com describing it as “softened butter…creamed with honey.”
Honey butter used to be a part of the Sunday bread bars in upperclassmen dining halls, according to Crista Martin, director for strategic initiatives at Harvard University Dining Services, where it was offered as a spread along with the likes of sourdough, multigrain, and garlic bread. However, Martin said that honey butter was removed this fall.
Aguirre wondered why it had been removed from the dining hall, since it had been a popular spread for her and several of her friends.
“I’m all for having several options [of spreads] in the dining halls… not just eating the same stuff,” she said.
Why was this change made?
“I think it was simply one of the many changes we make each year as we try different things,” said Martin in an emailed statement.
Rest in peace, honey butter– you fell in the face of new culinary HUDS innovations.

After the 1996 renovation of the Science Center basement bathrooms and the 2003 makeover of nearly the entire Science Center, Cabot Library has been left in need of a facelift. This past week, Harvard announced sweeping construction plans for Cabot Library, with early renderings highlighting a modern and pristine design language. As the deadline for the start of the renovation approaches, Flyby suggests some crucial additions to make Cabot Library the new place to be.
DecoArt Glass Paint Markers
What better way to prove that the Science Center is an innovation hub for the University than by letting students use the glass walls as whiteboards? Harvard announced that the walls and windows of Cabot Library will be replaced with glass walls that will integrate the library with the Greenhouse Café and the exterior of the Science Center. Using the walls as a writing surface will make us look both intense and resourceful (the ideal Harvard combination, if you ask me). To avoid p-set questions from permanently ruining the new walls of Cabot, Flyby recommends that the staff at Cabot uses specially-made dry-erase markers built for using on glass surfaces. #innovation
Outlet Power Strips
This one may seem obvious but, sadly, it feels like Au Bon Pain has more plugs than the second floor of Lamont and Widener combined. The average over-achiever at Harvard likes to work, scroll through Instagram, Snapchat bae, and check their email all at once. Because this requires continuous charging, we demand that Cabot Library pulls the plug on the outlet shortage.
Noise-Cancelling Headphones
While Professor Jeffrey T. Schnapp believes that “what you really want a library to do is to be a place where people can be involved in collaborative work”, Cabot is also the place to finish your p-set last minute before running to class in Science Center B. The solution to this controversy is noise-cancelling headphones. After all, what else are we going to do with our $36 billion endowment?
Vending Machines
Due to the renovation, Cabot Library will be exporting over 80 percent of the library’s print materials to another site within the Harvard Library System, as well as making the sources available online. While this seems reasonable, it’s only fair that the void the print materials leave be filled with something equally vital: food (who's with us). Flyby thinks that vending machines such as Sprinkles Cupcake ATM, Sushi-Kun, BurritoBox, or Farmer’s Fridge (fresh salads in airtight jars, whaaaat) are the move. Goodbye depressing granola bars and fruit cups at Greenhouse, and hello luxury snacking.

If one day of Halloween is just not enough for you, you might have found yourself on the shuttle to the quad this past weekend to relive the glory at Currier’s annual Heaven & Hell party, this year held a week after Halloween. Even if you didn’t manage to make the shuttle, however, Flyby is here to offer its take on the night’s event:
Currier featured a long roped-off line beginning inside the double doors and stretching around the side of the building. The outside area was well-regulated by a mix of HUPD and Securitas (not an exclusively-Harvard security company FYI) to keep an eye on the heathens spilling out of the party. Once inside, Harvard IDs were checked and everyone paid $2 before they were filed into Hell, located in the Currier Treehouse.
Even if you wanted to party in a more godly environment (where you might think you rightfully belong), you had to enter Hell first and then cross the party to get to the Stairway to Heaven, located in the Ten-Man suite on the second floor. Most students opted to stay downstairs in Hell, which was much better suited for a larger crowd (also very telling). The Currier Lobby acted as a makeshift Purgatory, with Crimson EMS waiting patiently to revive the souls (and stomachs) of any sinners who might have let the libations flow a bit too freely.
Hell played mostly club remixes of pop songs, with an occasional rap song sprinkled in here or there for the better dancers of the crowd. From what I could gather from the few fleeting moments I spent in Heaven, the music selection was around the same, verging more on the techno side.

Over the past couple of months, the internet has turned an ostensibly innocent request: “Do you want to watch Netflix and chill?” into an innuendo implying...well, more than binge-watching “Gilmore Girls” for six hours straight, that’s for sure.
This degradation of a simple invitation to hang out is surely a travesty. We at Flyby are big fans of actually watching Netflix (especially when we are procrastinating on our work) and would love to invite friends to join us without it being misconstrued as some sort of salacious solicitation.
Besides, the college hook-up scene is confusing enough already. If someone asks you to get dinner in the Square, is it a date or just a platonic meal? What impact does your DFMO from Friday night have on your relationship status? (None whatsoever, sorry.) Why won’t that cute guy from your section text you back? How do you know if she wants to date or just hook up?
As someone who has gone to a networking event and accidentally ended up on a date instead, (and as someone who has never been on a date), these are complicated questions that we still grapple with. The last thing we need is another one added to the list: Does he actually want to watch “Mad Men,” or does he have more Don Draper-esque things in mind? 
In order to reverse this perverse trend, we at Flyby recommend that Harvard students instead proposition their peers with a simpler request: “Pset and Chill?”
For those shy Flyby readers unsure of how to pull off this move, do not despair. Here are some simple guidelines to the “Pset and Chill”:
Step 1: Take a class that assigns problem sets weekly. This is also a good opportunity to get that pesky SPU Gen Ed out of the way.
Step 2: Text your prospect. Avoid any emojis that could be taken as innuendo. We’re looking at you, eggplant.
Step 3: Meet up and work on your pset. Be sure to stick to the standards outlined by Harvard’s honor code.
Step 4: Turn in your pset on time and watch your GPA soar! Congrats, you have successfully pset and chilled. After all, Harvard kids can’t have fun unless they’re doing homework, right?
P.S. For those of you who are more humanities inclined, simply swap out “pset” for “deconstruct postmodern paradigms and chill” and you should be good.
