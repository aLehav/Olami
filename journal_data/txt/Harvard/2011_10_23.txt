After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A group of Harvard global health activists staged a protest Friday in front of Merck’s laboratory near the Harvard Medical School to urge the drug company to provide discounted HIV and AIDS medicine to poor countries.
The protest was billed as a “pool party demonstration”—replete with beach balls, an inflatable pool, and students in swim trunks—to demand that Merck “jump into the pool,” a reference to the Medicine Patent Pool.
The Medicine Patent Pool is an organization that negotiates deals with drug companies to ensure the availability in low-income and middle-income countries of discounted medicine to fight the human immunodeficiency virus. In many of these countries, drugs to fight the disease are far too expensive to be affordable to ordinary individuals. The deals struck by the Medicine Patent Pool seek to reduce costs while also attempting to ensure that the companies are minimally impacted by the discounts.
Merck Research Laboratories develops drugs to help treat HIV, but has not joined the patent pool. Merck does provide discounts for low-income countries but has not extended them to middle-income countries, which was a focus of Friday’s protest. The protest was organized by the Harvard College Global Health and AIDS Coalition and Students for Global Health and Justice at the Harvard Medical School.
According to Alyssa T. Yamamoto ’12, a member of the Harvard College group, demonstrators are demanding that Merck “join the pool by January 2012 or at the least implement a similar program” by that deadline.
Yamamoto said that the pool party was inspired by similar protests against Johnson & Johnson in the United Kingdom, led by the Stop AIDS Campaign.
At Friday’s protests, the student speakers at the event addressed the audience while standing in the inflatable pool, criticizing Merck’s refusal to join the pool as a human rights violation.
Gilead, a competitor to Merck, has already signed an agreement with the Pool, according to Matthew F. Basilico ’08, a second year student at Harvard Medical School. At least four other peer companies are in negotiations to join the pool.
Basilico noted that a further goal of the demonstration was to have Merck create an “agreement with the pool to include pro-access provisions, for middle-income countries and active pharmaceutical ingredients,” referring to the need to make the drugs not just affordable but also easily available.
Nworah B. Ayogu ’10, a second year medical student and president of the Medical School’s Student Council, noted afterwards that the demonstrators were content with how the event went. He said that he hoped that Merck would now “realize how seriously Harvard takes its commitment to the underserved and the Medical school takes its mission to alleviate human suffering caused by disease.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Food Law Society at  Harvard Law School hosted a conference Friday on United States food  policy, discussing healthy diets, federal agricultural laws, hunger, and  how to encourage healthy eating. The conference highlighted the need to  increase access to cheap, healthy food and to rebrand healthy food as  something with mass appeal.
Most of the conference was centered on the legal and economic issues  associated with food. Doug Rauch, former president of Trader Joe’s Co.  who helped turn the California chain into a national success, spoke on  what he called “the U.S. hunger paradox”—the idea that we have more food, more cheaply than any nation in history, but more people are going  hungry. Rauch went on to explain that on the supply side, we have so  much food that people who can afford to buy can afford to waste; it’s so  cheap that many people throw good food out unconcerned.
On the demand side, Rauch said, those afflicted by poverty cannot afford  food containing essential nutrients, leading to malnutrition, and can  only afford cheap food with empty calories, leading to obesity. Rauch is  fighting empty calories by opening health food stores in poor  communities whose products are cheap, but still economically sustainable  for the business.
“Fighting hunger isn’t about a full stomach, it’s about a healthy meal  ... This is something we know how to cure, what is missing is the  prospective, the policy, and the will to do it,” Rauch said.
Jennifer  Pomeranz, the director of legal initiatives at the Rudd Center for Food  Policy and Obesity at Yale, discussed the market conditions that made  unhealthy food so much more popular than healthy food. Pomeranz  criticized the restaurant industry for lobbying to keep calorie counts  off of menus. That effort, she said, has worsened access to healthy food, which is less aggressively marketed, less  accessible, and more expensive.
“They expect you to be responsible, but they don’t give you the info needed to be responsible,” Pomeranz said.
Freya  Williams and Graceann Bennett—two executives at OgilvyEarth, a  marketing company devoted to promoting sustainable products—discussed  how to make sustainability more appealing to consumers. They cited the statistical observation that environmental  sustainability is either seen as “feminine” or “for rich elitist snobs  and crunchy granola hippies” as hindrances to greater sustainability. The apparent femininity makes men  embarrassed to engage in its practices, and the elitism and hippie  mystique deters the moderate middle class.
Bennett explained that the  key is for sustainable companies to engage in marketing techniques with  masculine and more mainstream-America appeal.
“Honestly, what guy is going to buy a little square car called a Nissan Leaf?” Williams quipped.
The  conference was sponsored in name by Technology, Engineering, and Design  (TED), a nonprofit focused on spreading ideas through conferences that  can be viewed online for free. The HLS conference was independently  organized by the Harvard Law Food Society, an organization dedicated to  giving HLS students experience in food and agricultural policy from  legal, managerial, and scientific perspectives.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard field hockey team (7-6, 3-2 Ivy) fell out of first place in the Ivy League standings with a heartbreaking loss on Saturday to Princeton (7-7, 4-1).
The Crimson entered the game in a five-way tie for first place in the Ancient Eight standings, giving the team its best opportunity in recent history to win a title. But the dream ultimately fell short with the 4-1 loss at Jordan Field.
Heading into the game Harvard was excited for the chance to sustain its first place standing.
“We were really excited to try to keep first place in the Ivy League,” co-captain Carly Dickson said. “It’s always a great game against Princeton, since they are a strong team this year and we were excited to have a good game against them.”
The Crimson came out strong in the first 15 minutes and controlled the momentum, but it was unable to take the lead before giving up corner opportunities to the Tigers.
“We had some really good preparation," Harvard coach Sue Caples said. "[Going into the match], and in the first 15 minutes or so, it was a great game and we controlled a lot of the momentum. Then we gave up some corners and we kind of got back on our heels a bit.”
Princeton turned the momentum of the game with its aggressive offense, leading to several scoring opportunities. That resulted in freshman Allison Evans firing a shot past Crimson goalie Cynthia Tassopoulos 19 minutes into the contest.
The Tigers mounted another attack with less than eight minutes remaining in the half as they entered the Harvard zone. The Crimson defense appeared to make a clean stop with a good defensive play, only to have the referee award Princeton a penalty shot.
Tigers junior Charlotte Krause entered the penalty corner and passed to freshman Sydney Kirby, who placed the ball down for sophomore Amanda Bird. Bird placed the ball past the left side of the goalie for the score, resulting in a 2-0 Princeton lead with seven and a half minutes in the half.
“They got a couple of corners in a row and that was what I think caused the momentum shift,” Dickson said. “I wish we had gotten a goal in the first 15 minutes when we were playing so well because I think we would have kept the momentum if that happened.”
The score remained 2-0 heading into halftime. The Crimson knew the next goal in the second half would be crucial to the outcome of the contest.
“I think we were okay going into halftime,” Caples said. “We went into halftime with it being 2-0, and we knew that the next goal in a 2-0 game would be pretty important.”
The Tigers came out and once again controlled possession of the ball, leading to two penalty corners. That gave them a 9-1 penalty corner advantage at that point in the game. Princeton had several shots on goal but Harvard was able to hold on in the first seven minutes of the half and keep the game close.
The Tigers, though, were able to mount another attack, as Evans was able to sneak into the right side of the zone and get off a good shot. Evans was denied by a great diving save by Tassopoulos, but the ball bounded right back to Evans, who took the rebound and raised a shot over the fallen Tassopoulos into the net, giving the Tigers a commanding 3-0 lead that deflated the Crimson.  
“[The goal] put them up, 3-0, and that was tough,” Caples said. “It spiraled a little bit on us and we played back on our heels instead of attacking. We made some skill error and just lost our momentum and at that point we need to stay disciplined in our fundamentals and execute the game plan to dig ourselves [but] we weren’t able to get anything going.”
Princeton stretched the lead to four as senior Rachel Neufeld scored off a rebound which effectively ended Harvard’s hopes of capturing the Ivy League title.
Crimson freshman Noel Painter scored two minutes later making the score 4-1, but ultimately the goal was not enough to spark a comeback.
Despite missing out on the Ivy League title, Harvard will look to rebound and finish out the season strong.
“Princeton is a strong team but, you know, we are close and there is still a lot of work to be done for us,” Caples said. “I look forward to see how we respond tomorrow [against Colgate].”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two goals, two leads, but ultimately, another loss.
Such was the case for the Harvard men’s soccer team, which fell, 3-2, against Princeton on Saturday afternoon at Ohiri Field. The Tigers’ second-half comeback earned Princeton (4-8-1, 1-3 Ivy) its first Ivy win of the season and relegated the Crimson (2-10-1, 0-4) to the lone spot at the bottom of the league.
“Overall, the result was disappointing,” Harvard coach Carl Junot said. “We would have liked to have had a complete performance from our team. It was a game that we let get away from us. I saw some sparks though ... We’ve established who some of our strongest attacking threats are, so there are some positives to draw from the result.”
The Crimson started off the first half strong, capitalizing on its offensive momentum to put its first tally on the scoreboard nearly seventeen minutes into the game. Sophomore defender Eric Slingerland sent a long pass into the box from the left side of the midfield, with the ball bouncing over the defense.
Sophomore forward Obiajulu Agha ran onto the cross, jumping and heading the ball over the outstretched hands of the advancing Tigers goalie for the first score of the match.
But Princeton would respond just over three minutes later, when freshman midfielder Julian Griggs beat the Harvard defense down the center of the field, dribbling into the box and forcing a one-on-one with senior goalkeeper Austin Harms before placing the ball into the left side of the net.
“It is always good to score first,” Junot said. “I would like to say it’s unfortunate, but I think it is more disappointing that we gave up a goal so soon after we scored. Credit to Princeton on that goal. It was just a foot race between our defender and their forward, and they scored a good goal to draw even.”
In the 32nd minute, the Crimson earned its second lead of the game when senior midfielder Jamie Rees slotted the ball between the Tigers’ center and left defenders into the right side of Princeton’s box.
Freshman forward Michael Innocenzi made a through run behind the defense onto the ball, placing a hard one-time shot on the ground inside the left post to score the first goal of his collegiate career and put Harvard back up.
“I was pretty thrilled with getting a second goal so quickly since we haven’t scored too many goals this year,” Junot said. “I was really happy with our attacking play in the first half. Michael Innocenzi has been one of the attacking sparks for our team this season, so for him to get a goal was fantastic.”
But once again, the Tigers were quick to respond, scoring six minutes later. Freshman forward Cameron Porter stole the ball from the Crimson’s back line in its defensive third, dribbling to the end-line and sending a cross in front of the goal from the right side of the box. Griggs batted the ball in from in front of the net, notching his second score for the match to tie the game up before the half.
With both teams fighting to break the tie in the second period, Princeton converted the ball with twenty minutes remaining to take its first lead of the game.
Freshman defender Myles McGinley split the Harvard defense with a through pass onto Porter, who then slotted the ball past Harms near post from a tough angle on the right side.
The Crimson offense placed two more hard shots on frame in the remaining time, but the Tigers’ sophomore keeper Seth MacMillan stopped both to preserve Princeton’s lead and prevent a Harvard comeback.
“After being scored on twice in a game, a team often figures out how it should defend the opponent’s offense,” Junot said. “Princeton adapted and hunkered down in the defense, and early in the second half, it was able to keep us at bay in terms of our attacking play. Once they got the goal, we really had to push. We made some strong efforts in the second half, but overall it was a disappointing result.”
Princeton out-shot Harvard, 14-3, for the game, while Harvard bested the Tigers, 4-3, in corners. Harms recorded six saves for the match.
“It was a disappointing game and had its ups and downs,” co-captain Tim Linden said. “We had two goals, which was the first time to happen this season, and we also had two leads, which is also something that hasn’t happened this season. But we let them slip away, which is something that has continued to happen this season, so we are going to have to keep learning from things like this.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard women's soccer strengthened its hold on the top spot of the Ivy League Saturday night with a crucial home win over Princeton—even though the victory came with anguish in the final minutes of the match.
The Crimson (10-4-1, 4-0-1 Ivy) overcame a final period dominated by the Tigers (5-9-1, 1-4-0) that saw Princeton's Jen Hoy decrease a 2-0 deficit to one with less than three minutes left in the game. Harvard did not give up the equalizer in the final minutes, frustrating the Tigers with possession in the final third of the pitch.
Rookie Mai Le scored the first tally of the game 27 minutes into the first half, chesting down a deflection before hitting a hard volley to the right side of the net.
Princeton came out of the half determined to get the equalizer, dominating possession from the get-go. But on a counterattack set up by a long ball from the defense, rookie Meg Casscells-Hamby used her velocity to run behind the Tiger defense and send in a low cross to a sprinting Melanie Baskind, who put away the easy tap 14 minutes into the second period. The co-captain notched her seventh goal of the season and has 21 points thus far.
Princeton outshot the Crimson in the game, 15-7, but the home team was more efficient in converting its chances. Harvard will host Dartmouth in its penultimate conference game of the campaign next Saturday.

Harvard Johnstone Family Professor of Psychology Steven Pinker appeared on "The Colbert Report" this past Tuesday to showcase his new book, "The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined."
Stephen Colbert started with a question concerning the book's subtitle, asking, "What do you mean violence has declined? There's violence everyday; turn on 'Real Housewives.'"
 Pinker responded that violence per capita has been in decline over the past several thousand years. "We may be living in the most peaceful era of our species' existence," Pinker said.
Pinker primarily focused on the dramatic decrease in violent warfare since the World Wars. "If you plot the rate of death in warfare, since World War II, it's a bumpy downhill decline," he said.
Pinker also cited a similar decrease in homicides over the past few centuries, saying, "In the middle ages you were 35 times more likely to be murdered than you are today."
Pinker's book, which came out earlier this year, refutes the notion that we live in a particularly cruel period of human history. Pinker acknowledges that violence is still a prevalent issue, but he argues that human proclivity toward violence has conspicuously diminished.
Pinker has appeared on "The Colbert Report" twice before: first in 2007 and then again in 2009 to present one of his earlier books, "The Stuff of Thought: Language as a Window Into Human Nature." This upcoming spring semester Pinker will be teaching Science of Living Systems 20: "Psychological Science."
The full interview is available here.
This post has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: OCTOBER 24, 2011
An earlier version of the Oct. 23 post "Back for a Third Time: Steven Pinker on 'The Colbert Report'" included a quote from Colbert in which he misidentified the source of the title of Pinker's book. It is, in fact, derived from Lincoln's first inaugural address.

It's not entirely unusual to hear Harvard students complaining that they don't have enough free time. While most will find the time to fill out a voter registration form, doing so has been made significantly more convenient. A new service, TurboVote, developed by two Kennedy School alums, claims to make voting by mail "as easy as renting a DVD from Netflix," according to the website.
TurboVote aspires to make voting simple enough to be done from your dorm room or even from lecture. Fill out your name, address, date of birth, and ID number, and TurboVote will send a completed ballot request form and an addressed, postage-paid envelope ready to sign and send off. The best part? The service is free for Harvard students.
"It's a great idea for people who consider voting a matter of convenience rather than passion," said Amanda E. McGowan '13, chair of the National Campaign at the Institute of Politics.
TurboVote has made the job of organizing voter registration drives easier, too. "In the past we've had to lug around 50 different registration forms," McGowan said, "but with this kind of voter registration, all you need is a laptop."
The initiative has proven successful at getting Harvard students involved in politics. According to McGowan, almost 500 members of the class of 2015 registered using TurboVote on this year's study card day.
"It's an exciting, easy way of getting young people involved in politics," McGowan said, "in fact, it might almost be easier than Netflix."
