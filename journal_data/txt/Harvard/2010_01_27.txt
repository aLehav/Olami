After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend, students returned to campus with bags in their hands instead of under their eyes after Harvard’s first five-week-long winter vacation. Now that the pilot J-term is over, it seems clear that the new schedule succeeded in offering students time to relax or travel that they otherwise might not have taken. Still, while we recognize the College’s current financial constraints, we believe that Harvard should present students with more J-term opportunities in the future, allowing the young program to grow in size, quality, and popularity.
Next year, Harvard should offer optional enrichment programming that would not count toward academic credit. These ungraded classes would give students a chance to explore new fields and interests without the pressure of competition or GPAs. Meanwhile, those who enjoyed spending time at home, traveling, or working during this J-term could continue to do so. In this way, Harvard could support the relaxing component of vacation while still encouraging students to keep their minds engaged in non-competitive, stimulating pursuits.
In the future, we hope that the College extends its definition of a “legitimate” reason to stay on campus during the month of January. We were pleased that nearly all J-term applicants received housing this year. However, we believe the list of eligible J-term students should grow to include students engaging in other productive activites, such as classes, extracurriculars, or exam preparation. However, the College should continue to require applications from prospective J-term students presenting a clear reason for their desire to stay.
In light of its financial difficulties, Harvard will likely need to cut costs in order to accommodate more residents over the break. Thus, the College should consider having students apply separately for room and board. Ideally, everyone who remains on campus during J-term would receive a meal plan. However, Harvard cannot wait to expand the program until economic conditions improve. Awarding HUDS privileges based on an application process that considers financial need could allow the College to increase the number of students in residence over J-term at low cost.
We feel certain that the recent five-week break was an improvement over Harvard’s previous calendar. If the College can provide additional programming and housing in the years to come, then we remain optimistic about the future of J-term.

Who ever said that it was a good idea for larger men to wear skinny jeans?
I mean, seriously. The other day I was sitting on an airplane, watching the usual slice of America attempt to squeeze derrières far too large into seats far too small. In the age of the seat belt extender, this is hardly an unusual sight. But just before takeoff, there was a rotund man rolling a wheelie suitcase down the aisle in way-too-tight pants. What was he wearing? You guessed it—sheaths of spandexy “denim” someone told him counted as jeans.
In fact, the continued existence of skinny jeans in the closet of the American male consumer is one of the biggest issues plaguing society today. Unfortunately, the anthropologists have yet to come up with an explanation for this phenomenon, and there is currently no “Social Analysis” core offering devoted to the subject (although you never know with “GenEd”). Regardless, the question still remains: why are these god-forsaken leggings so popular among members of the male gender, even among the bigger specimens?
My theory about the popularity of skinny jeans is that, sadly, skinny jeans are used as tools for improving one’s self-image when a mirror is nowhere to be found.
You see, people want their clothes to present them in as thin and as fit a manner as possible. Why else would a larger man like the guy on the airplane stuff his limbs into leg-leotards better suited for the thighs of a twelve-year-old girl? When the men who wear skinny jeans purchase their jeans, they do so merely because they can squeeze into them and enjoy the satisfaction of fitting into the smallest possible pair with the same waist size as the other pants they usually wear. (I would argue that the same is true of tight T-shirts, although, thankfully, they seem to be less of an epidemic.) In a sense, skinny jeans allow some men to feel skinny even when, as the case of the airplane guy clearly demonstrates, that is hardly the case.
What’s so wrong with that, you ask? What’s wrong with allowing people to make choices that in turn make them feel better about themselves? To be honest, I don’t really have an answer other than that it’s tragic that one must feel thin in our society to feel happy and that it must be exponentially more painful to wear skinny jeans than it is to watch someone wearing them.
I realize that this is a contentious issue and that I will probably lose friends over the course of this little polemic. I am not here to argue that men should wear, as The New York Times’s Guy Trebay recently complained, “mommy jeans or pants reminiscent of Ted Danson in ‘Cheers.’” I am merely attempting to facilitate dialogue on an unaddressed problem.
After all, somebody has to say it: Death to skinny jeans!

On Nov. 4, 2008, the people of the United States gave Barack Obama power. We gave Congress power. We regret it.
I am a registered Democrat who vigorously campaigned for President Obama. He sold America on the notion of bipartisanship over policy agendas. Despite campaigning as a Democrat, he breached party lines and won over Americans with a genuine desire to listen, regardless of political affiliation. He championed the idea that everyone had something to bring to the table.
He wrote about the nobility of government and how procedural rules “help define our democracy just as much as elections do...and by respecting that system, we give shape to our values and shared commitment.”
Barack Obama believed in the system. At least, that is what he told America. So, who was the guy in the Oval Office behind closed curtains in secret meetings with Congressional Democrats about healthcare legislation? He chose to avoid the very system so deserving and demanding of respect. He sold out a visionary view of our government for health-care reform that actually had very little reform in it. As soon as the Senate announced the passage of the health-care bill on Dec. 24, 2009, stocks for the very industry responsible for the health-care crisis soared.
Americans can’t grant consent on legislation when they aren’t given access. When the people of the United States are denied transparency in the process of enacting legislation, the voters are denied their fundamental right to object. Obama wrote about laws being “uniform, predictable and transparent ... applying equally to the rulers and the ruled.” There is no transparency when a leader blatantly ignores the procedures of Congress that call for open debate because to do so is to his political advantage. When preferential treatment is given to unions, pharmaceutical companies, and insurance providers behind closed doors there is no sense of fair play. There is no equality when a Nebraskan senator is bribed with promises that benefit his state but is to the detriment of other states. There is only inequality. There is obscurity. There is corruption.
The President, along with Democrats in Congress, disenfranchised millions of Republicans across America with his agenda. While serving in Congress has become more of a career rather than a call to public service, it seems the commander-in-chief is paving that path. Barack Obama once wrote, “The answer I settle on sees our democracy not as a house to be built, but a conversation to be had.” As president of the United States, the only conversation he wants is with those who acquiesce.
In 2008, I wanted change. The change I wanted isn’t the change I am getting.
America is facing a trillion dollar deficit. Our tax dollars have bailed out endless corporations who have flagrantly misused it. We saved the banks, yet they deny us fair lending and take our homes. We sit by and watch million dollar bonuses given away to the very executives that put our economy in peril. We hear about scandals involving AIG, the New York Federal Reserve, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Bank of America—there are too many to list. We listen helplessly to members of congressional oversight panels who condemn them with their voices but continue to pay them with our money. Unemployment has risen to 10 percent. And now, they want our health-care?
Americans deserve better. Proposals such as bank taxes and punitive legislation are gimmicks. Banks will simply pass that tax on to their customers. While the stock market plummets with announcements involving banking regulations, in the end so will lending. And unemployment goes unmentioned. Constitutional checks and balances are up for grabs when the president promises a “forceful response” to rulings issued by the Supreme Court of the United States on campaign finance restrictions. There are three branches of government, not one. Presently, the executive branch is being ruled by a demigod who wants control of it all.
The direction America is headed with President Obama at the wheel is ominous. We wanted debate, not domination. We wanted transparency, not obscurity. We wanted inspiration, not despotism. We wanted the great conversation in Congress with the constitutional guarantees. But the White House closed the curtains and eliminated the bright lights of camera crews and adversaries, thereby leaving every single voter in the dark. The voters were left behind. Congress was left behind. When the curtains were closed, America was left behind. A leader without any followers is just a guy taking a walk. Obama is walking down a path leading to unprecedented deficits, unbelievable spending, and unreliable consequences.
No more. The voters have sung with voices stentorian in Massachusetts. This is only the beginning. The song being sung across America is about the audacity of the voters. Ignore them at your peril. At the end of the day, those who put you in power have the power. We are the people of the United States and we have had enough. The president can pay for his own walk—a walk that will lead from the White House all the way back to Chicago in 2012. Congress can tremble knowing the “audacity of hope” might indeed be God’s greatest gift to us, but the greatest gift the founders gave us was the right to vote. And in 2010, we are taking our country back. Yes, we can.

At Harvard, students are encouraged to critically engage every dimension of our lives except one: religion. Such peculiar institutional myopia harms students and reveals an unfortunate inconsistency in Harvard’s pursuit of its motto, Veritas. In truth, since religion is a no less prevalent nor less valuable form of diversity as race and class, the university should encourage discussion of this facet of the human experience as well. Harvard should also ensure that those who are unsure of their beliefs can be accommodated and not grant de facto preferential treatment to those with a religious affiliation.
First, consider the attention that we are told to give to equally controversial topics. Before freshmen even set foot on campus, the Freshman Dean’s Office tells students that “questions about identity and privilege seem especially important to consider”—identity with respect to “race and class,” that is. Socioeconomic and racial components of one’s life are worthy of focus, but these are not the only areas about which critical thought would benefit students. In the instance of Community Conversations, the College places an “emphasis not on finding ‘right answers’ but on figuring out where you stand.” Crucially, this demonstrates that issues of a debatable and personal nature are, in fact, the very exemplars of the dialogue “central to a Harvard education.”
Second, note how there’s no public forum for the general discussion of religious opinions. To be sure, there are a variety of specific religious student groups on campus. But there is no collective space in which critical thinking about religion in general, rather than a specific religious tradition, can occur. It’s true that the programming at Memorial Church is helpful with respect to a general Christian perspective, but there needs to be a place where students of all persuasions can ask more fundamental questions about religion. The Institute of Politics is responsible for fostering conversation within the political realm, but there is no similarly organized place for discussion of religious issues.
The IOP’s recent panel discussion “Challenges to Faith at Harvard” revealed more clearly Harvard’s need for a general religious space on campus. The IOP’s Harvard Political Union astutely recognized the lack of dialogue about religion, and held the event for this reason. As Shankar G. Ramaswamy ’11, chair of the HPU, noted, “We decided to have this event because it’s the type of matter that students might be reluctant to strike up a conversation about, because of the controversy around it.”
Third, a distinctly religious public discussion space would be an extension of current, albeit incomplete attempts to engage with students’ faith-based identities. Rather than being completely foreign territory, a university-sanctioned, interreligious place of dialogue would be an augmentation of current efforts. Harvard currently organizes a “Reflecting on Your Life” program for first years to see how their “personal values” might affect their desire for a particular “life dream.”
Yet this approach is insufficient. The College needs to recognize sooner or later that many students currently use a distinctively religious vocabulary, with all its metaphysical baggage, to address these same questions. And until the advantages of a faith-based approach to questions outside of students’ career or academic choices can be shown to be inappropriate for some students’ needs, Harvard should not be afraid to foster a distinctively religious dialogue.
Some without a particular faith might eventually want to try religious language, in all its diversity and complexity, on for size, perhaps without reference to a particular faith. These students, situated on the religious spectrum somewhere between agnosticism and a particular belief, should have a non-denominational space in which to voice their beliefs both with fellow students as well as with different religious groups on campus.
This new dialogue could take a number of different forms. One viable solution would be for all Harvard Chaplains to regularly extend invitations to students to ask questions about faith in general. Alternatively, student groups, in the spirit of this semester’s IOP event, could send a representative to a general religious caucus. These meetings would expand the dialogue among religious groups and provide a space in which students could find out more about this fundemental element of human experience.
True, not everyone desires to participate in religious life. But by offering the opportunity for communication between faiths and between believers and nonbelievers, the College can accommodate the diversity of student needs on religion. Yes, theists of nearly all faiths have communities to join, while atheists and agnostics have the Humanist Chaplaincy at Harvard. But students who are interested in religion but are unsure whether a particular community will fit them should have a place, too.
The College has not yet chosen to foster religious dialogue in this way. There are many students who self-identify somewhere between pious and skeptical, and their interests have been unjustly neglected for fear of controversy. The University needs to facilitate discussion for those students who are interested in faith but are not yet ready to turn to a particular denomination.
As Community Conversations shows, clarification of the issues surrounding personal identity often involves debate and even some discomfort. But if an endeavor is worthwhile so long as it helps students better understand others’ identities, then the College needs to help students “become more aware of the diversity in society”—a society that is religiously as well as racially and economically diverse. The College should internalize its motto and realize that the examination of religious matters is an undeniable aspect of student life here at Harvard that deserves to be accommodated.

As Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke ’75 faces a challenging reconfirmation battle in the U.S. Senate, he has garnered lukewarm support from some Harvard economists.
The macroeconomists interviewed for this article commended Bernanke for steering the economy away from the brink of collapse, but they also questioned elements of his monetary policies.
“I’d probably give [Bernanke] more of a C+,” said Jeffrey A. Miron, the economics department’s director of undergraduate studies. “But I don’t think many other people would have done better than a C-.”
Miron added that Bernanke at least has “a stable consistent set of policies,” even though they are not “optimum.”
“If you bail out [banks] for taking too much risk, you’re going to encourage more risk-taking,” said Miron, who identifies himself as a libertarian.
It has grown increasingly unclear in the past week whether Bernanke—whose term as Federal Reserve chairman expires Sunday—can garner the needed 60 votes in the Senate to be reconfirmed.
Opposition to Bernanke has emerged from both the left and the right. Seventeen senators said they would oppose Bernanke or are leaning in that direction, but only 36 were committed to or leaning toward approving his nomination, according to a Reuters poll released Monday.
Former Economics Department Chair James H. Stock credited Bernanke with coming up with “creative options” to combat the economic crisis. He called Bernanke “far and away the best choice” because the learning curve for a new chairman would be overwhelming.
While Stock blamed the Bush administration and Department of the Treasury for clumsy fiscal management of the economic crisis, he described Bernanke’s aggressive monetary policies as having “a strong theoretical foundation” and being “the right way to pursue the problem.”
Harvard Kennedy School Professor Jeffrey A. Frankel also expressed strong support for Bernanke.
“There will be some senators who are looking forward to their own elections, and think that they have to stampede with the rest of the panicking herd,” Frankel said. “It’s scapegoating.”
Columbia Economics Professor Joseph E. Stiglitz—who has more liberal leanings—said in an interview Monday that Bernanke’s economic philosophy was fundamentally flawed.
“He was responsible to bringing the economy to the brink,” said Stiglitz, who called the AIG bailout “unconscionable.”
“On the other hand, the economy didn’t go over the brink, and people are appreciative of that,” he added.
Nonetheless, Stiglitz predicted that it is “likely that [Bernanke] will be confirmed.”

Justin R. Timberlake will be honored as Hasty Pudding Theatricals’ 2010 Man of the Year next Friday, Feb. 5.
Timberlake, 28, was selected for his wide range of talents across the arts, according to Pudding press manager David J. Smolinsky ’11.
“He is a real Renaissance man,” Smolinsky said. “He’s an artist who has been able to do it all and has succeeded in each endeavor. Whether it’s with music or film or songwriting or producing, he’s really established himself in all of his ventures.”
Moreover, Smolinsky said Timberlake has a special relevance to those currently enrolled in the College.
“He’s an artist that our generation has grown up on,” he said. “We’re just very excited to have him here.”
Timberlake will be awarded the traditional Pudding Pot after an 8 p.m. roast by Pudding producers Kelly M. Conley ’11 and Stephen L. Rola ’11. Following the roast, the Pudding will present their 162nd show “Commie Dearest.”
Tickets are already sold out for the event, and Smolinsky said that at least 40 names are on a waiting list.
After launching his music career as the lead singer of ’N Sync, Timberlake went solo in 2002. A year later, his debut album “Justified” won two Grammy Awards, one for Best Pop Vocal Album and another for the single “Cry Me a River.” His next album, “FutureSex/LoveSounds,” brought him another four Grammy Awards.
While best known for his music–and perhaps the “wardrobe malfunction” involving him and Janet D.J. Jackson during Super Bowl XXXVIII–Timberlake has also started his own record company, acted and voiced characters in movies, started a clothing line, opened several restaurants, and taken home Emmy awards for his performances in “Saturday Night Live.”
In a tradition started in 1963, Timberlake joins past Pudding honorees such as Harrison Ford, Samuel L. Jackson, and James E. Franco, who was last year’s Man of the Year.
Anne J. Hathaway, the star of movies ranging from “The Princess Diaries” to “Rachel Getting Married,” will be honored as the Pudding’s 2010 Woman of the Year on Thursday.

Following three weeks of speculation, Cambridge City Councillor Marjorie C. Decker officially announced yesterday her candidacy in the May 11 special election for former State Senator Anthony D. Galluccio’s currently vacant seat.
Galluccio resigned from his seat Jan. 5 after being sentenced to one year of jail for violating his house arrest by consuming alcohol. Candidates vying for his seat must submit their nomination by March 2, and the primary will be held on April 13.
Decker, who won her sixth term as a write-in candidate in November after missing the deadline to turn in nomination signatures, said she would focus on improving public education, affordable housing, and employment opportunities as State Senator.
“Local residents can’t do it alone, much more needs to be done at the state level,” Decker said. “I believe I can do more to make a difference for all of us in the State Senate. I’m ready.”
The youngest woman to be elected to the City Council in 1999, Decker drew upon her background as a daughter of working class parents growing up in public housing in Cambridge and pointed to her 10-year record on the council in her speech.
Decker joins Galluccio’s chief of staff Sal DiDomenico, Timothy R. Flaherty—who ran against Galluccio for the Senate in 2007—Michael J. Albano of Chelsea, and Daniel C. Hill of Charleston in the senate race.
All candidates are members of the Democratic Party.
State Representative Alice K. Wolf, who is supporting Decker in this election, praised her former legislative aide’s record as a member of the City Council.
“Marjorie is a terrific choice,” Wolf said. “She has the passion, background, and values that will be able to represent the district quite well,” Wolf said.
Decker’s mother, Cathy, expressed pride in the work her daughter has done thus far.
“I’m wicked proud of Marjorie, considering all she’s been through—especially with the write-in election,” she said.
Addressing a handful of spectators who had gathered near Central Square, Decker called repeatedly for reform of jobs statewide and for more affordable housing to be available in Massachusetts.
“I don’t want excuses, I want action,” Decker said.

The University announced Friday the establishment of a fund for employees whose families have been affected by the earthquake that struck Haiti almost two weeks ago.
The Employees Emergency Relief Fund, created with gifts from both the University and the Harvard University Employees Credit Union (HUECU), is seeking donations from faculty and staff to be distributed as grants to eligible employees.
A preliminary list of eligibility qualifications was released to the employees on the Harvard employee intranet (HARVie) Monday, when University President Drew G. Faust sent a letter to faculty and staff announcing the availability of the fund.
“At least 75 men and women who work for Harvard have been personally touched by the disaster,” Faust wrote in the letter. “They are coping with the loss of loved ones and struggling to assist friends and relatives left without homes.”
The relief fund accepts tax-deductible donations made either online, in person, or by mail to HUECU and will be open for one year.
The funds will be distributed to employees who apply for grants through the HARVie Web site.
Applications for financial assistance will be accepted starting Monday, Feb. 1. Harvard faculty and staff as well as vendor employees who work on campus qualify for grants from the fund.
The idea arose shortly after the earthquake when a group of administrators and Human Resources officials sought suggestions from faculty and staff members about how to help Haiti, according to University spokesman Kevin Galvin.
After administrators presented the plan to Faust last Wednesday, they determined the final details before the initial announcement was posted on the Harvard Gazette and HUECU Web sites Friday.
“Generally, people really wanted to find a way to help their colleagues who are going through a really tough time right now,” Galvin said.
The HARVie Web site also notes that the Harvard’s Employee Assistance program, which provides 24/7 multilingual counselors to support those impacted by the earthquake, is open to all current employees, their household members, managers, and co-workers.
“Through this fund, I hope that you will consider joining me in offering tangible support to the men and women working among us who have been touched by this tragedy,” Faust wrote in the letter.
The University will not be disclosing the fund’s current balance or their fundraising target, according to Galvin.
In the “unlikely” event that funds still remain after one year, the surplus will be donated to general Haiti relief, according to the HARVie Web site.

Researchers at Harvard-affiliate Dana-Farber Cancer Institute have identified a group of genes that may predict whether certain breast tumors will recur after being treated by the most common chemotherapy drugs.
The study, led by  Andrea L. Richardson, a professor of pathology at Harvard Medical School and Zhigang C. Wang, a professor of surgery at the Medical School, discovered two genes located on a chromosome whose presence amplified resistance to anthracycline drugs. The pair of genes, found in 20 percent of the samples, inhibits cancerous cell death and prevents the chemotherapy drugs from reaching the cell nucleus.
According to Richardson, this preliminary research may ultimately provide an alternate approach to treatment for breast cancer patients.
“Our findings suggest that you can do a test for the expression of these two genes and predict which tumor will be resistant to anthracyclines,” she said. “Because it is one of the most commonly used agents in treatment, it would allow us to tailor which kinds of therapy will be the most effective for our patients.”
Medical School Professor Craig A. Bunnell, who works in Dana Farber’s Breast Oncology Center, said women diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer often have tumors surgically removed before the disease can metastasize. Following surgery, patients receive chemotherapy to destroy any microscopic cancerous cells traveling through the bloodstream and may also undergo hormone and radiation therapy. The dilemma, Bunnell said, is determining which patients will benefit from chemotherapy. Though many stay in remission after chemotherapy, others relapse.
“All of the decisions that we as doctors must make are calculated by analyzing the risks over the benefits,” Bunnell said. “We don’t want to subject a patient to the side effects and the toxicities associated with chemotherapy if she will not derive benefits from the drug.”
Karen S. Anderson, an oncologist at Dana Farber, said that this preliminary research may also stimulate other investigations about the nature and the development of cancerous cells.
“These genomic-based studies are important because they may help us identify biomarkings that will allow us to tailor treatment to a particular cancer,” she said. “The findings may also tell us how cancer cells develop resistance so that these genes may be targets for intervention.”

Following an unsuccessful four-month investigation of the Aug. 26 poisoning at a Harvard Medical School laboratory, the Harvard University Police Department is no longer actively working on the case.
After interviewing more than 150 individuals over the course of its investigation, HUPD decided that its “efforts, unfortunately, have not yet resulted in the resolution” it has been seeking, according to a Dec. 23 message to the Medical School community.
HUPD continues to welcome leads and is leaving the case open, and HUPD spokesman Steven G. Catalano refused to identify what, if any, conclusions HUPD came to over the past four months, citing police department policy barring comment on open cases.
The Aug. 26 incident sent six researchers to Harvard-affiliate Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center with a variety of symptoms ranging from ringing in the ears to dizziness.
Toxicologists later identified the presence of a laboratory preservative called sodium azide in the water tank of a coffee machine at the Medical School’s New Research Building.
The Medical School has taken a series of safety measures following the incident, including improving the security of the filtered water supply, adding cameras in the New Research Building, and installing an emergency text message system for students and staff in the pathology department where the poisoning occurred, according to the message.
The Medical School’s Executive Dean for Administration Daniel G. Ennis and Associate Dean for Physical Planning and Facilities Richard M. Shea Jr. wrote in the message that the school’s Faculty Policy Committee will be forming three groups to look into laboratory safety and compliance, security, and human resources issues.
Matteo Iannacone, a victim of the incident who alleged possible foul play in an Oct. interview, said yesterday that police had asked him whether there existed any animosity among researchers in the laboratory. Iannacone, a research fellow at the Medical School, said he was unable to help HUPD since he was unaware of any office resentment.
Though he maintained his suspicions that the poisoning could not have been accidental, he said that things had resumed to the way they were before the incident.
“Everything’s back to normal,” he said, “except we have no more coffee machines.”

When senior goaltender Christina Kessler sustained a career-ending torn ACL last week, it appeared that the Harvard women’s hockey team had found itself on thin ice.  Kessler holds the NCAA career record with a .9413 save percentage, stopping 1,863 of 1,979 shots during her years at Harvard.
Now, after Kessler’s injury, the responsibility of protecting the goal falls to the shoulders of freshman Laura Bellamy.
Despite the newfound pressure Bellamy now faces, hockey is a part of life for the Minnesota native.
“Hockey is very popular in Minnesota,” Bellamy said. “My whole family played, and I learned how to skate when I was only three or four years old. My brother, who is also a goalie, taught me how to play the position, so I guess it’s just in my blood.”
The idea that hockey is innate for Bellamy was clearly evident through her performance in the net throughout the season. During her first-career start against Princeton on Jan. 8th, the freshman made 13 saves in the 3-3 tie. She contributed the same number of saves in her first career shutout in a 4-0 victory over Union on Jan. 22nd, and then posted a career-best 25 saves against Rensselaer the day after.
“Although [Bellamy] kind of got thrown into the position, she certainly is getting better and better in every game she plays,” Crimson coach Katey Stone said. “She’s a great kid, and very athletic.”
“Now that Laura has had the opportunity to play, she’s begun to gain more and more confidence each game,” co-captain Kathryn Farni added. “She’s eager to learn and always has a smile on her face.”
The only misfortune is that Bellamy’s opportunity to play has come as the result of an injury to a teammate who was not only a talented goaltender but also a leader for the Crimson squad.
“When we found out Kessler got hurt, it was devastating to the team,” Bellamy said. “You don’t want anyone’s career to end that way, but for her, as arguably the best goalie in the country, it was especially terrible.”
In her final game, Kessler became Harvard’s all-time wins leader with her 64th victory, making 21 saves to contribute to a 5-1 victory over Colgate. The loss of their senior goaltender is no doubt terrible, but Bellamy as well as her Crimson teammates know they cannot throw in the towel.
“Now we have to pick up the pieces—the season cannot be over yet,” Bellamy said. “We still have the same goals and the same destination for our season; it’s just going to be a different road to get there.”
This road requires Bellamy to not only make the transition from high school to Division I collegiate play but also develop into a team leader and game saver as a freshman.
“It’s definitely time for me to prove myself and step into the role that [Kessler] has been playing the last three-plus years,” Bellamy said. “It’s certainly bittersweet to be playing when you usually have to win the position on the team, but like anything in athletics, it’s an opportunity.”
Farni already sees Bellamy beginning to prove herself to her team and her position, which speaks to the future of the hockey program.
“She’s everything you could hope for as a senior for a freshman coming in,” Farni said. “She had butterflies at the beginning, but now she’s making the big saves, and she really looks like she belongs in college competition. She’s becoming a leader already.”
With a number of games left to be played before the season ends, the seventh-ranked Harvard team still has time—as Bellamy said—to pick up the pieces.
“Now we have to come together and use Kessler as extra motivation to win,” Bellamy said. “We’re still going to try and do what we had planned all season; we’re still going to win hockey games.”
“You never know how the season will go, you can’t predict the outcome, but you do have to bring your best everyday,” Stone echoed.
The unpredictable conclusion to the season will ultimately be determined by Bellamy and her teammates as they look to continue a winning year.
But for now, Bellamy will try to fill the skates of a talented predecessor and become the best player she can.  Based on her early performances and the confidence of her team, the best player Bellamy can be will no doubt be a great one.
“She has an attitude that will take her wherever she’s willing to go,” Farni concluded. “She’ll do great things.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Miami: The city of the ’72 Dolphins, Dwyane Wade, and…Harry Parker?
Miami Beach City Commissioner Jerry Libbin seems to hope so, as he declared Jan. 20 “Harry Parker Day” in the city to thank Harvard’s heavyweight head coach for bringing his (and Radcliffe’s) crews to the Ronald W. Shane Center for a winter training trip.
Of all of Parker’s accomplishments, this may have been the most surprising.
Arguably the most recognizable name in rowing, Parker has won pretty much everything at the collegiate level —starting with eight official national championships.
He also won eight “unofficial” national championships in which his crews beat all the best teams (of course, if this were BCS football, those titles wouldn’t need the “unofficial” label).
In addition, he’s taken home 25 Eastern Sprints varsity eight titles (including every single year between 1964 and 1970) and gone undefeated in the dual season 20 times since 1963. In the process, he was on the cover of Sports Illustrated (1965) and had a boat house named after him (the Harry Parker Boathouse dedicated in 2008).
I could go on and on, talking about his Olympic experience, his accomplishments in single scull, and his success against Yale (“The Race” predates “The Game” by the way).
But why should I extol my admittedly-biased opinion when I can let Elaine Roden, executive director of the Shane Center, do the talking?
“Harry is a legend,” she said. “Anyone involved in rowing has heard of Harry Parker.”
That kind of visibility, Roden hopes, will bring crews to Miami Beach in the future.
But publicity aside, Roden felt that Parker’s accomplishments stood as reason enough to get his own day in Miami.
“We wanted to acknowledge that this amazing rowing legend was here,” Roden said.
Now Miami has a day celebrating a sports legend most in the city have never heard of. So just what exactly does this mean for the city?
Parker’s fame among the casual Floridian sports fan probably won’t increase too much.
Don’t expect people to replace Dwayne Wade jerseys with Harvard crew unis (you don’t want them to, trust me) or to watch Eastern Sprints instead of the NBA Playoffs.
But expect local businesses to get a boost in January if teams as large as Harvard and Radcliffe keep coming back.
Roden guessed that the average visiting crew brings 40-60 people; Harvard, on the other hand, brought 191.
And after a grueling practice, rowers tend to be pretty hungry.
That can make the difference for small businesses such as the Juiceatery, the team’s favorite smoothie spot this trip. As a rower on the women’s crew team, I went in to order a “milkberry” smoothie last Friday, only to be surprised when the girl behind the counter told me she was giving rowers a special discount because they brought so much business.
While our performance on the water may be what helps raise the profile of the Shane Center, if we are to have any kind of impact on the surrounding area, it will be with our appetites.
But maybe there’s a way we can contribute a little bit more. Now that we’ve gotten rave reviews from Roden for our behavior, maybe we can take it a little bit farther next year.
Because crew is such an exhausting sport, it’s easy to forget what a luxury it is. Everything about it—the travel, the boats, the oars, even the ergs—costs money. Even the best rowers in the world don’t turn a profit from it. Perhaps for these reasons, rowing has earned the reputation as a prep-school sport, one where the rich succeed.
Those more familiar with the sport know that’s not true—certainly  not at the collegiate level, where anyone can walk on to an elite program such as Harvard, as I did last year.
But not everyone realizes that. The rowing world is very much separate from mainstream athletics, which is why we rowers hear Harry Parker and think of the rowing legend when others think they misheard “Harry Potter.”
But we have an opportunity to show otherwise. What if one afternoon, instead of rowing, we volunteered at a Miami elementary school or soup kitchen? Then we could give back to the community that plays host to us in January, allowing us an escape from the erg. It’s one thing to buy smoothies; it’s another to demonstrate appreciation.
Everyone seems to look up to sports stars. Maybe someday they’ll count Harry Parker, Liz O’Leary, and the Harvard and Radcliffe Crew teams among those stars.
We’ve already got a holiday, right?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tonight, President Obama will give the State of the Union address on national television. But now, I offer a far less monumental analysis—the state of ECAC women’s hockey.
Back in November, I used this space to talk about the shift that was starting in the conference’s power dynamic. Clarkson and Cornell had gotten off to quick starts, but a part of me believed that they would fade—the Golden Knights have a recent history of dropping off in the second half of the season, and the Big Red’s roster is chock full of youngsters.
As it turns out, I was wrong on both counts.
With just four weekends left in conference play, Clarkson and Cornell have begun to distance themselves from the rest of the ECAC. The Golden Knights are sitting pretty at third in the national polls and tied No. 1 Mercyhurst two weeks ago.
The secret to Clarkson’s sustained success? That would be senior Dominique Thibault, who transferred from Connecticut this year and is leading the conference in total points.
The Big Red, on the other hand, is relying on a quartet of underclassmen—sophomores Catherine White and Chelsea Karpenko and freshmen Laura Fortino and Lauriane Rougeau—for its success.
Though Cornell fell out of the national polls a few weeks ago, when the absence of White, Fortino, and Rougeau due to national team commitments led to a three-game losing streak, the Big Red is unbeaten in four games since the trio’s return.
But with two surprises atop the conference, one big question comes to mind—where the heck are the powerhouses?
Well, Harvard—winner of the last two league regular-season titles—is right behind, sitting alone in third place and currently seventh in the national polls.
Like Cornell, and many other teams in the conference, the Crimson is a young team this year that has perhaps exceeded expectations thus far.
Junior Kate Buesser has stepped into the large shoes left by a talented offensive class of 2009, leading the team with 23 points. Her talented rookie linemate, Jillian Dempsey, is right behind her with 19—and her 1.00 points per game are third-best in the country among freshmen.
But Harvard is primarily a defensively-focused team, and the senior trifecta of co-captains Cori Bassett and Kathryn Farni and goaltender Christina Kessler has led the nation’s fourth-best scoring defense, allowing just 1.53 goals per game.
But the Crimson did face a setback last week when a torn ACL abruptly ended Kessler’s collegiate career. Rookie Laura Bellamy will be thrown into the fire, with a good deal of the team’s postseason chances resting on her young shoulders.
Harvard also has welcomed junior Kylie Stephens, a backup netminder for the last two years, back to the fold, giving the Crimson some much-needed insurance in the crease. And luckily for Bellamy, she has a battle-tested defensive corps in front of her—and Harvard’s winningest goaltender to guide her from behind the bench.
But for Bellamy and her teammates, there’s no time for practice. While the Crimson seems a lock for a postseason spot (the top eight squads in the 12-team conference will advance to the league tourney), there will be a dogfight for home-ice advantage over the next four weeks.
Just two points separate Harvard and seventh-place St. Lawrence, and the four teams right behind the Crimson in the standings all have at least one conference game in hand.
Perhaps the biggest surprise of the ECAC season has been the rise of the Quinnipiac program, currently sitting in a three-way tie for fourth.
The Bobcats have never made the conference playoffs since they joined the league in the 2005-06 season, but they are receiving votes in the national polls for the first time in history.
But equally surprising as Quinnipiac’s rise is the fall of the Dartmouth program. After winning the conference tournament and advancing to NCAAs a year ago, the Big Green is now fighting with Yale and Colgate for the eighth playoff spot.
For a team that has enjoyed sustained success in the ECAC over the last decade—and returned four of its top six scorers from a year ago—Dartmouth’s struggles are difficult to explain. Perhaps the hole graduated goaltender Carli Clemis left behind was too large to fill, but more likely, with so many teams on the rise, some program had to fall.
Harvard pays a visit to Hanover this Friday, and a win would help right the ship after the Crimson lost at home to Rensselaer, 4-2, last Saturday. Harvard’s league schedule the rest of the way is mostly favorable, with games remaining against four of the bottom five teams in the conference, but three road contests—at Renssealer on Feb. 12 and a brutal road trip to Clarkson and St. Lawrence in the regular season’s final weekend—will prove crucial to the Crimson’s quest for home-ice advantage.
Harvard is still a young team with a lot to prove, but with a lot of confidence and a little bit of luck, it has the talent to make noise in the conference playoffs. Will the Crimson have the legs to make it back to the NCAA Tournament after a year’s absence? It’s too soon to say, and the competition will be stiff.
But in a league where the power balance is so much in flux, be sure of this—it’s certainly possible.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There’s a new man in charge of the Cornell football program.
After Christmas, former Big Red coach Jim Knowles stepped down to take the defensive coordinator position at Duke, and Cornell conducted a national search for a new leader. The school found its man in Mississippi offensive coordinator Kent Austin.
The Big Red will officially present Austin in a press conference at 10 a.m. tomorrow.
Knowles resigned after six seasons at the helm in Ithaca, leading his alma mater to a 26-34 overall record (16-26 in Ivy play). Cornell finished at or above .500 in three consecutive seasons (2005-2007) and finished third in the Ivy League in 2004—the first team in Ancient Eight history to follow up a winless conference season with a winning league record.
The Big Red finished in the Ivy basement last season, though, going 2-8 overall and 1-6 in conference.
Austin arrives in Ithaca after two seasons of leading the Rebel offense. In his tenure, Ole Miss recorded consecutive nine-win seasons and won two Cotton Bowls.
He will inherit a Cornell squad that finished sixth among Ancient Eight programs last year in both scoring and total offense.
Austin is the second new Ivy coach to be appointed this offseason. Princeton announced the hiring of Cincinnati Bengals assistant and Tiger alum Bob Surace on Dec. 23.
Former Princeton coach Roger Hughes was fired the day after the regular season ended.

The Harvard Advocate, the undergraduate literary magazine, just published its Winter 2010 issue, Bestiary. But before you dive into the slick pages (filled with animal parts, dead chickens, and weeds), check out our review. We’ve done some quick and dirty research for your reading pleasure.
Here are seven highlights:
“Attention Chicken!” by Nicholas Lampert
A photo series of a 10-foot sculpture of a dead chicken—beheaded, de-feathered, and cleaned—taken in various public locations. Quite daunting. pp. 76-79.
“The Blood of Birds: Death, Steel, and Cockers" by Kevin Seitz
A sometimes bloody feature about cockfighting and other bestial contests. We raised our eyebrows at this line: “[P]erhaps he could have called upon the careers of George Washington or Thomas Jefferson who once raised cocks.” pp. 44-51.
“In the Animal Shelter” by Amy Hempel
This short, short story comments on women and the adoption of animals. An interesting revelation: "Every time you see a beautiful woman, someone is tired of her, so the men say.” p. 64.
“Untitled (Paper doll)” by Rebecca Lieberman
A digital collage of a woman’s face with her eyes removed and her lips infected with syphilis. Below the portrait, there are three rows of new eyes and lips to choose from.   Reminds you of those dress-your-own-cardboard-cutout dolls, except scarier. p. 87.
“Magic Kingdom Come” by D.A. Powell
“Usually, the days are crowded hot. / The line into tomorrow’s weightless zone / takes considerable agency. Baby strollers bump / against ones anklebone. What a hangover one has.” We feel it too. p. 98.
“People of the Glades” by Rachael Goldberg
Seemingly disjointed but colorful memories about Indians, kissing, and just plain living in the Florida Everglades. Warm winters not included. pp. 120-123.
“When the Bear Came” by Benjamin Percy
An interesting perspective on the battle of man (and woman) versus nature. Don’t be discouraged by its length. With gems like this—“I think that was what bothered me most, the sight of her panties"—it is definitely worth your time. pp. 28-41.
And that's just the beginning. Read the issue to find out for yourself just how beastly it is!

Sometimes shopping six courses a day can lead to missed meals and hunger pangs during your umpteenth syllabus perusal of the day. In fact, some of you are probably hungry right now. Well, we’ve got just the solution for you! Get your daily serving via one of these food-related courses.
But first, let’s revisit some shopping week highlights of the day. We heard that in African and African American Studies 10: "Introduction to African American Studies," Professor Henry L. Gates Jr. played an attention-grabbing rap about literacy. Though it may sound like a strange convergence of themes, Gates used the song to discuss how during the Enlightenment, literacy was viewed as the link to humanity, and Africans who could not write were seen as less than human.
Professor Joshua D. Greene '97 of Psychology 15: "Social Psychology" employed the gross-out factor to keep students on the edge of their seats today. Apparently, he called three students to the stage and proceeded to give the first one a big hunk of fudge, which was quickly devoured.  He then gave the second girl a piece of the same fudge, but shaped like poop. He made sure to point out this fact, but she ate it after a brief moment of hesitation. The third girl was told to spit in a cup and then drink it, which she, too, did after hesitating. All this was done in the name of a lesson about how automaticity makes us hesitate before rationally deciding to do things that would otherwise be automatically considered repugnant.
Chemistry 17: "Principles of Organic Chemistry" was somewhat livened up today by a runaway green balloon floating aimlessly around Science Center B. Maybe it had been used in a demonstration about electrons or something earlier in the day—or maybe it was just funny.
And now for your delicious courses. Dig in!

Though most of us are probably more likely to check out HarvardFML than Harvard’s homepage, the University’s Web site is a pretty hot link, according to one recently released set of rankings.  In fact, the Web site 4 International Colleges and Universities lists Harvard’s as the third most-visited college or university Web site in the world.
Harvard was beaten out by MIT, whose brightly colored admissions site boasts frequent blog posts by admissions officers and current students, and Stanford, whose site showcases plenty of photos of students enjoying the Palo Alto sun.
The Top Ten also featured four other American universities: University of California, Berkeley (5), University of Pennsylvania (7), Cornell University (8), and Yale University (10). The rest of the list included the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (4) and two Chinese schools, Peking University (6) and Shanghai Jiao Tong University (9).
