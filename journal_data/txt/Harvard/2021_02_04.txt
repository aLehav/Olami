After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s hardly a secret that we humans tend to take the serious — well, seriously. We equate dourness with wisdom, humourlessness with intellect. At the same time, we tend to discount joy and optimism as symptoms of childlike innocence, regarding them with fond condescension at best and scathing contempt at worst. Most people, especially when divulging a longtime personal secret under the bedazzled magnifying glass of the public eye, prefer to be taken seriously. Who doesn’t?
Well, JoJo Siwa, for one.
Joelle Joanie Siwa, better known by her stage name “JoJo Siwa,” is a child star well on her way to growing out of child stardom. Now 17, Siwa rose to prominence in the reality TV show “Dance Moms” as a spunky, indefatigable young dancer. Soon after entering the public eye, she and her mother Jessalynn left to let Siwa pursue a solo career at Nickelodeon.
Now, Siwa has an astonishingly successful career, with over 12 million followers on YouTube and some 32 million “Siwanatorz” on TikTok. Any unsuspecting shopper walking through the ‘kids’ section of any mall in America would be hard-pressed to escape Siwa’s beaming visage peeking out from backpacks, T-shirts, and, of course, bow-decorating kits.
As could be assumed from the over 80 million JoJo Siwa bows sold, Siwa’s audience is composed primarily of preteens and elementary schoolers. This is precisely why it was so meaningful when Siwa announced to the world (or, well, to TikTok) her membership in the LGBT+ community. In coming out, Siwa stepped right into a harsher, brighter spotlight than even teen stardom usually provides. She will be an essential player in helping normalize queerness for a whole age bracket hitherto unrepresented by popular culture. Considering this new pressure, it’s perhaps a tad surprising that the follow-up video, posted to Instagram, consisted only of Siwa’s all-too contagious smile and the repetition of the word “happy” — ”I’m just so happy… I have felt so much happiness surrounding me.”
Every word she said in that 15-minute video was immediately understandable to a middle schooler. Some of it sounded like it had come straight out of a Nick Jr. script. All of it radiated pure joie de vivre. This was a fairytale meant for her younger audience as well as the rest of the world, a clear and emphatic endorsement of the message that, in Siwa’s own words, “it’s okay to be different.”
This coming out could portend a shift in audience demographics. As Siwa expands to a newer, older, audience, the bows and sequins may, at least partly, give way to more age-appropriate merchandise. But for now, she shows no sign of growing up. Her most recent EP, ‘JoJo’s Rocking Christmas,’ involved just as much sparkly rainbow glitter and unapologetic cheer as her first-ever 2016 hit “Boomerang.” In brand and in personality, she remains the same JoJo she has always been.
As much as Siwa represents the product-based cult of personality typical of the age of influencers, as much as she profits almost grotesquely off her own image, there is still something about her that is instinctually and uniquely loveable. Achingly sincere, but rarely serious: that’s JoJo Siwa.
In her coming-out video, Siwa, clad in hoodie and omnipresent giant bow, delivered naïve positivity by the bucket. “I know that everyone’s situation is different and it might be harder for some people, and it might be easier for some people to come out or to be themselves,” she said. “I think coming out has this stigma around it that it’s a really really really scary thing. But it’s not anymore.”
Telling her enormous audience of Siwanatorz that coming out is nothing to be ashamed of, that it is a universally acceptable thing to do, that “we should never ever ever be afraid of [being different],” is undeniably starry-eyed of her. But it is also an incredibly valuable message from one of the biggest child stars in America. Yes, coming out is still an unrealistic proposition for many closeted teens, and yes, her words may grate on some people who recognise that coming out still has a great deal of stigma surrounding it. Not everyone will get that “endless amount of love and support” that she did. (Siwa herself has already faced some backlash, including being “swatted” by the LAPD after a hoax call). But her unadulterated joy in coming out is still immensely important.
From singing about reindeer to coming out, everything Siwa does and says radiates cheerful, bushy-tailed sincerity. It is as bizarrely frustrating as it is hard to relate to. You don’t believe that “the world is there for you.” Of course you don’t! You know better! But Siwa believes it, so wholeheartedly that even a frigid tiny-hearted Nietzsche-clutching cynic like you or I has trouble disputing her belief (if not the actual content of that belief). And that, in a strange and maybe slightly irritating way, is comforting. At least for Siwa, it’s rainbows all the way down.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 1793 France, the Reign of Terror commenced, coating the streets with crimson. French revolutionaries violently turned against the country’s monarch and attempted to establish order via the guillotine. Bread was sparse and tensions between wealthy aristocrats and commoners were high. An estimated 27,000 people were killed. The widespread starvation and executions popularized a saying attributed to philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau: "When the people shall have nothing more to eat, they will eat the rich."
“Eat the Rich” is now a rallying cry against an overly capitalistic economy that encourages the rich to become richer while the poor starve. People such as the world’s richest man, Jeff Bezos, are a cautionary tale of success. For while Bezos’s philanthropic efforts have helped many people, he has notably donated less money than other billionaires to the point that some consider him unethically wealthy. At current costs, Bezos could cover the cost of direct care expenditures for every cancer patient in the U.S. for the next 30 years, and still have plenty left over.
“Eat the Rich” is directed toward people like Bezos and their wealth hoarding. This hoarding lifestyle has a tendency to promote outrage, especially when people like Bezos derive much of their wealth from the labor of low-wage workers. This is, in part, the reason for the enormously wealthy minority holding an incredible majority of the world’s money pool. According to Forbes, “the top 1 percent of U.S households hold 15 times more wealth than the bottom 50 percent combined.”
“Eat the Rich” comments on money hoarders who gluttonously bathe in billions, a fraction of which could easily end world hunger.
Before you deem this a passing phrase, take a walk along the Charles River and look at the pavement below your feet. You are sure to find a simple, white, all-capped “EAT THE RICH” written. Perhaps then you would begin to notice this rallying cry of oppressed revolutionaries painted in multiple spots around campus: “EAT THE RICH.”
That these phrases are scattered within such a tight radius of Harvard’s campus can hardly be coincidental. “Eat the Rich” is a reminder to Harvard students; a reminder to us that while we may go on to succeed, wealth must not consume us.
Graffiti of such strategic placement is meant for a certain audience; it’s meant for Harvard students and affiliates. Harvard students who attend the university with the largest endowment. Harvard students whose salaries 10 years after enrolling are 299 percent higher than the national median. Harvard affiliates who make up 40 percent of President Joe Biden’s proposed innermost circle.
This Charles-side graffiti may also be directed at the current Harvard community’s place in Cambridge. The Covid-19 pandemic has only heightened the struggles of those experiencing homelessness, as Boston-area homeless shelters have reported an infection rate of 35 to 40 percent. With shelters now having a lower capacity due to Covid-19 concerns, many individuals are presumably deserted to freezing temperatures during these winter months. Now more than ever, shelters need community support.
While Harvard University donates some money to homeless shelters, they could be doing more in Cambridge to alleviate the struggles faced by people experiencing homelessness. On any given day, you are bound to see at least 10 people without housing sitting on curbs outside of the Harvard Yard. Ironically, the Yard is cluttered with 500 $381 chairs — yes, that amounts to $190,500 in chair costs. This extravagant purchase is eerily reminiscent of the French monarchy’s thrones: Students carelessly sit upon them, unaware of those that may be crushed underneath.
“Eat the Rich” graffiti is both directed at the Harvard student body and the University community. It serves as a reminder and a cry for us to give back to Cambridge and society as a whole. Next time you take a stroll along the Charles, look for “EAT THE RICH,” and rather than ignoring the poignant painted words of Rousseau, remember to watch where you’re stepping.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Samuel H. Bersola, a Graduate School of Education alumnus and current administrator at the University of California, Los Angeles, will become the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences’s new Dean of Students on Feb. 8, GSAS Dean Emma Dench wrote in an email to students Wednesday.
As Dean of Students, Bersola will lead the offices of residential life, student affairs, and student services, as well as oversee the GSAS Student Center and GSAS Title IX resource coordinators, Dench wrote.
Currently serving as UCLA’s assistant vice provost for graduate education, Bersola — who earned a master’s in educational administration and social policy from the Graduate School of Education and a Ph.D. in education policy from Stanford University — previously worked in undergraduate admissions at the University of Southern California, California State University Maritime Academy, and Amherst College.
Dench praised Bersola’s past initiatives to support underrepresented students in higher education in the announcement.
“A first-generation-to-college Filipino-American, Sam has championed equity, inclusion and diversity in higher education throughout his career, leading numerous programs that have increased the enrollment, retention, and graduation rates of underrepresented and low-income students,” Dench wrote.
In an interview posted to GSAS’s website Wednesday, Bersola highlighted the importance of supporting international students, teaching assistants and fellows, students with families, and others who have been disproportionately impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.
“Teaching assistants and fellows, for instance, are making great sacrifices, waking up at odd hours in time zones throughout the world to lead discussions and share knowledge with other students,” he said. “The pandemic has had an impact on graduate research, too. The fact that students can’t travel to conduct research has delayed projects or forced researchers to redesign them altogether.”
“Looking forward, I think we’ve gotten a clearer understanding of the fact that graduate students are a vital and vulnerable population that needs a great deal of support,” Bersola added.
Bersola also said he hopes to work closely with the GSAS Office of Diversity and Minority Affairs to promote an inclusive learning environment for all graduate students.
“I’ve known [Dean of Academic Programs and Diversity] Sheila Thomas for over five years now, ever since she and I met on the road, recruiting diverse students who participate in pipeline programs for graduate education,” Bersola said. “As dean of students, I will support and collaborate with Dean Thomas and ODMA in any way that I can.”
Dench wrote in the announcement that Bersola’s personal experiences navigating institutions of higher learning will strengthen his capacity to guide students.
“Sam’s own experience as a master’s and PhD student as well as his administrative expertise in student services, residential life, and other areas make him an outstanding choice as dean, and he is excited to return to Harvard and to join GSAS, where he can champion graduate students and help them realize their potential,” she wrote.
On Feb. 8, Bersola will officially replace former Dean of Students Garth O. McCavana. McCavana, a former resident dean of Kirkland House who worked at Harvard for 32 years, retired at the end of the 2019-20 academic year.

Some admissions officers and college counselors said they were unsurprised by College Board’s decision to discontinue the SAT Subject Tests and SAT with essay, but remain unsure about how the decision will impact the admissions process going forward.
College Board announced on Jan. 19 it would no longer offer the Subject Tests or the SAT’s optional essay section, citing the need to adapt to “new realities and changes to the college admissions process.” While the College Board will continue to offer the SAT, many schools — including Harvard College — recently made the decision to remove standardized testing requirements for the upcoming application cycle due to the coronavirus crisis.
“Never has it been more important for admissions officers to look at students’ achievement in context,” Zachary Goldberg, the executive director of media relations and external relations at the College Board, wrote in a statement.
“The College Board has supported flexibility in admissions during the pandemic. That flexibility must extend to all student achievements, ranging from schoolwork to extracurricular activities,” he added.
Citing the unpredictable shifts in the admissions process this past year, college consultant Parke Muth said the implications of College Board’s decision are still unclear.
“It's either arrogance or willful ignorance to say we know how things are going to unfold,” he said. “I don’t think schools have decided yet.”
Zak M. Harris, a former admissions officer at Johns Hopkins University and Bowdoin College who currently works as a college counselor at InGenius Prep, said the College Board’s choice to discontinue the SAT’s essay option “did not come much of a surprise.”
“At any of the places that I ever worked, the essay score that students got really never played a very significant factor in the decisions that were being made anyway,” Harris said.
Phil Trout — a college counselor and former president of the National Association for College Admission Counseling — said he had expected the College Board to significantly cut down or eventually “scrap” the Subject Tests, pointing to a declining number of test takers over the past 20 years.
“My concern is, will the most selective colleges choose to implement at some point an alternate testing requirement?” Trout said. “The fear is that the answer to that question will be yes. And that it will be the AP test score.”
Jon J. Boeckenstedt, vice provost of enrollment management at Oregon State University, said he expects the removal of standardized tests will motivate more students — especially low-income students – to apply to more selective institutions. He also said that the shift in emphasis to AP tests will likely compel high school students to take the corresponding advanced courses.
“I think it will also have a ripple effect through the AP program and for school districts, school administrators, and superintendents to consider adopting more AP classes, which will then trickle down into more pressure on those students to take those classes,” Boeckenstedt said. “That can be both a good and a bad thing, depending on how you look at it.”
In spite of the uncertainty surrounding the future of standardized testing, some college counselors said they remain hopeful about the admissions process.
“My hope is that for all portions of the potential applicant pool, this is going to be a win,” Trout said.

Harvard University Health Services does not have the vaccine supply to begin vaccinating patients aged 75 and older, even as Massachusetts entered Phase 2 of its vaccine distribution plan this week, HUHS Chief Medical Officer Soheyla D. Gharib announced in an email to patients last Thursday.
After being approved by the state as a vaccine provider, Harvard began distributing vaccines to eligible Phase 1 patients, including healthcare workers, in December. As of Feb. 3, the University had received 700 vaccines total.
In the email, Gharib wrote that HUHS will reach out to patients again as soon as vaccines are available.
“At this time, HUHS does not have a supply of vaccine to provide to you, but we will be in touch as soon as we do,” she wrote. “Some state-run vaccination clinics in the region may have a higher supply than what HUHS may receive in the short term. If you would prefer, you can explore the options offered by the state.”
The email also included directions for finding vaccination locations outside HUHS and offered support for disabled individuals unable to get the vaccine at an outside site.
As an approved vaccine provider, Harvard requests vaccines every 10 days based on its anticipated need. HUHS Director Giang T. Nguyen wrote in an email to The Crimson that Harvard receives vaccines weekly from the state based on the approximate number of Harvard affiliates who qualify.
“Our anticipated need is based on the numbers within our Harvard community population who are or will be eligible in the following week/s under the state’s phased distribution plan,” Nguyen wrote. “For example, this week, the state opened vaccine distribution to individuals age 75+ under the beginning of Phase 2 of its plan, and with that, Harvard has requested vaccine based on our calculation of the number of people who fall into that eligibility category within the Harvard population.”
Barry C. Mazur, a math professor, said that he and his wife had signed up for vaccinations through the state.
Mazur praised the state website that helps eligible individuals sign up for vaccinations, to which a friend and fellow professor directed him.
“I was told to go to mass.gov. And it’s a beautiful site,” Mazur said. “Not only did we get our appointment, but we got a really, really, very detailed description of what we would have to do, what forms we would have to fill out.”
The vaccine appointments they managed to arrange through the state website were cancelled due to winter storms, but Mazur said he and his wife were able to find new appointments at Massachusetts General Hospital.
Orlando H. Patterson, a sociology professor, said he thought he would receive the vaccine from Harvard and started asking his HUHS primary care physician about it several weeks ago. Last week, his physician told him that he should pursue options outside the University.
“My doctor was quite upfront with me,” Patterson said. “He said, ‘You should try the state system. You are more likely to get an appointment before Harvard does.’ And he was right.”
Patterson said he was unsuccessful in scheduling an appointment the first morning the state’s website went live. He found that slots appeared to be open initially, but once he filled out the form, the site indicated they were all taken.
After enlisting his wife and daughter’s assistance, Patterson registered for the only available appointment at a North Adams site 126 miles away. He ultimately managed to find an alternative appointment in Roxbury on Feb. 1.
Patterson said although it would have been more convenient if he had received the vaccine through HUHS, he did not mind going to the Roxbury site.
“I don’t care where I get it, as long as I get it. What would’ve been unfortunate is if I had to drive all the way to North Adams,” he said.
Patterson said that he was surprised he could not access the vaccine through Harvard.
“The irony is that everybody assumed that because you're at Harvard, you'd get it as Harvard is privileged and so on. But that obviously wasn’t the case,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Graduate Council mulled student government priorities and institutional challenges brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic in its first public meeting of the semester Wednesday evening.
The Council — which represents all twelve of the University’s graduate and professional schools — communicates graduate student needs with Harvard administrators including University President Lawrence S. Bacow and Provost Alan M. Garber ’76. Wednesday’s meeting marked the start of biweekly public meetings, held over Zoom during the pandemic.
The meeting opened with remarks by Harvard University Health Services Director Giang T. Nguyen, who said there will “probably be stages” to the potential reopening of campus come fall. Despite a recent decline in Covid-19 cases across the country, the risk of infection remains due to the emergence of new variants, Nguyen added.
“I want to remind folks that we’re not out of the woods yet,” he said. “We have seen some variants of the coronavirus that have spread to the United States — the B117 variant, which is commonly referred to as the U.K. variant, has appeared not only in the U.S., but in Massachusetts.”
Nguyen commended the efforts of student leaders across the University to ensure widespread adherence to safety regulations — citing an overall test positivity at the University of under 1 percent — but urged students to continue exercising caution in the coming months.
“It’s really important for us to remember that we’re standing on a three-legged stool above a flood of Covid,” he said. “That three-legged stool is based upon masking, distancing, and hand-washing — we need to do all three of those things, or else the stool is going to topple over.”
Harvard Kennedy School voting representatives Emily K. Mello and Nicholas “Nick” J. Cannella then provided a virtual “tour” of the Kennedy School, followed by a presentation of the school’s priorities and challenges during Covid-19. The twelve graduate schools rotate “hosting” HGC meetings, a practice that has extended to the virtual format.
Mello cited housing and food insecurity, visa access for international students, and isolation as key challenges facing Kennedy School students during the pandemic.
“As you all were in the fall, we were completely online. We heard a lot from students about the challenges that that posed, and particularly, of course, from international students who were dealing with totally disparate time zones, and feelings of disconnection from the Harvard community,” Mello said.
Promoting anti-racist initiatives — including pushing for more tenure-track faculty of color— remains a student government priority for the Kennedy School, Mello added. She said progress has been made on the anti-racist front in recent months.
“The administration has agreed that Dean Elmendorf and his direct reports are going to be undergoing an anti-racism workshop led by a partner we’re working with, Community Change, Inc.,” Mello said. “And we did start — for the first time this semester — a core course for public policy students on race and racism in the making of the U.S. as a global power.”
HGC Chair of Student Life Angela Han then presented the HGC Student Life and Community Engagement team’s end-of-year report, co-prepared by Amreen Poonawala, the Council’s vice chair of community engagement. Han said promoting “inter-school collaboration,” including international students in social life, and supporting local businesses remain priorities for the team.
The meeting concluded with two action items. The first motion, presented by HGC President Chanthia C. Ma, endorsed the inclusion of HGC executive members in the WhatsApp chat group populated by voting representatives. The second, presented by Harvard Business School voting representative Apoorva Goyal, approved the Council’s spring budget.
Both motions passed unanimously.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The U.S. Department of Justice dropped a lawsuit accusing Yale University of discriminating against Asian American and white applicants on Wednesday, leaving it all but inevitable that the new presidential administration will withdraw its support for a similar suit against Harvard.
The decision to drop the Yale lawsuit marks an anticipated but significant shift in the Justice Department’s approach to handling affirmative action cases following the election of President Joe Biden.
Legal experts and observers widely expect the DOJ under Biden to pull its support for the lawsuit filed by the anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions, which accuses Harvard of discriminating against Asian Americans in its admissions process.
“This almost certainly means that DOJ will not continue to support the challenge to Harvard’s admissions process,” William R. Yeomans, a lecturer at Columbia Law School who worked in the Justice Department for 26 years, wrote in an email.
SFFA is expected to file an appeal “in the next few weeks” asking the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case, the group's president, Edward J. Blum, said Wednesday.
SFFA first filed suit against Harvard in 2014 in Massachusetts District Court. Harvard won that trial and a subsequent appeal before the U.S. First Circuit Court of Appeals.
Adam K. Mortara, the head trial lawyer for SFFA, said in an interview Wednesday that he believes the Justice Department withdrawing support for the suit would have no impact on the litigation.
“The Department of Justice and the Trump administration have been supporters of Students for Fair Admissions’ position, and the Department of Justice in the Biden administration may not be supportive,” Mortara acknowledged. “I don’t think that it’s going to impact whether or not there’s further review of the case in the Supreme Court or how the Supreme Court would rule if they took the case.”
Outside experts said it remains unclear how a move by Biden’s Justice Department to pull support for SFFA would impact the legal proceedings.
Vinay Harpalani, a law professor at the University of New Mexico, said he thinks such a move would make it “slightly less likely” that the court will hear the case, “if anything.”
“It’s sending a bit of a message that the Biden administration’s DOJ is on the side of affirmative action, they’re on the side of Harvard, they’re going to help make these arguments. And the political winds have gone that way a little bit,” he said.
The Justice Department — under then-President Donald Trump — originally filed its lawsuit against Yale in October 2020. A “notice of voluntary dismissal” filed Wednesday morning in Federal District Court in Connecticut announced the Justice Department’s decision to dismiss the suit “without prejudice.” A suit dismissed without prejudice allows the plaintiff to file a subsequent suit against the defendant on the same grounds.
The Justice Department’s decision to withdraw the case follows its two-year investigation into Yale’s admissions practices. In August 2020, the investigation found that Yale’s practices were in violation of Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which bans institutions receiving federal funding from excluding or discriminating against people “on the ground of race, color, or national origin.” On Wednesday, the Justice Department rescinded its notice finding Yale in violation of Title VI, though the department’s original inquiry remains open.
The DOJ’s move to drop the Yale lawsuit comes before Biden’s nominees for attorney general and assistant attorney general for civil rights — Merrick B. Garland ’74 and Kristen M. Clarke ’97 — have been confirmed by the Senate. Clarke has been supportive of race-conscious admissions policies in the past.
“I would have been surprised if the Justice Department continued on with this lawsuit” under the new administration, said Theodore M. Shaw, a law professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
Harpalani, the UNM professor, said he expects the DOJ to file a brief in support of Harvard should the Supreme Court take up the case.
Yeomans, the former Justice Department lawyer, wrote that the DOJ is often hesitant to make major changes early in a new administration “to avoid the appearance that its enforcement decisions are driven by politics rather than law.” Yeoman noted, though, that views on affirmative action have “long been a defining legal disagreement” between Democrats and Republicans.
“President Biden ran on a commitment to racial justice, including the dismantling of structural racial discrimination,” Yeomans wrote. “He has charged his entire administration with pursuing those efforts. It was inconceivable that DOJ would continue its effort to weaken the ability of universities to create diverse and inclusive classes.”
In a statement to other news outlets Wednesday, a DOJ spokesperson said the department dropped its case against Yale in part because of Harvard’s Nov. 12, 2020 legal victory in the SFFA appeal.
“The Department has dismissed its lawsuit in light of all available facts, circumstances, and legal developments, including the November 2020 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit rejecting a challenge to Harvard University’s consideration of race in its admissions practices,” the spokesperson wrote.
A Justice Department investigation into Harvard’s race-conscious admissions practices that began in 2017 remained ongoing as of 2019.
Harvard College spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on how Harvard believes the DOJ’s move to drop its lawsuit against Yale will impact Harvard.
Following the DOJ’s dismissal of its lawsuit, SFFA announced Wednesday that it intends to file a new suit against Yale challenging its admissions policies.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge City Councilors passed a proposal to rent non-congregate housing for the city’s unhoused population and received an update on the Covid-19 vaccine rollout during a Wednesday meeting.
The council plans to rent space from the New England School of English as non-congregate housing during the pandemic. Non-congregate shelters provide private, single rooms for each guest, whereas congregate shelters house guests in one common space. An executive order from the Biden administration promises states 100 percent reimbursement for the opening and operation of non-congregate shelters and other spaces through September 2021.
Last weekend, housing advocates distributed flyers to more than 1,200 Cambridge households in a campaign to raise awareness and rally support for the policy.
Though the order may help to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus among Cambridge’s unhoused population, the New England School of English shelter will not be a permanent solution to the city’s housing problem, Councilor Marc C. McGovern said.
“We are talking about a limited amount of time,” he said. “At the end of the day, they are going to want their dorm space back at some point. This is not a long term solution or long term investment.”
More than 100 Cambridge residents signed up to speak to the Council during the meeting. The majority of public comment indicated support for the Council's proposal to rent shelter space from the New England School of English, while others argued for the removal of “hostile” architecture from public transportation stations.
Dozens of students from the Harvard College Young Democratic Socialists of America gave statements at the meeting. Willa Canfield ’23, a HCYDSA member who gave testimony, said that providing more socially distanced shelter space is tied to the mission of addressing racial justice in the city.
“This is very much a racial justice issue as well as a human rights issue and a public health issue,” she said. “And I hope the City of Cambridge will treat it as such.”
City Manager Louis A. DePasquale and Claude Jacob — Cambridge’s chief public health officer — also presented the Council with a weekly Covid-19 update.
Jacob said that the country is experiencing a “severe shortage nationwide” of vaccines and, as a result, Massachusetts is “triaging” its current supply. Fewer doses are going to cities like Cambridge, with the majority being diverted to the State’s mass vaccination sites, according to Jacob.
DePasquale said that unlike Covid-19 testing, the city has “no control or authority” in vaccine purchasing or distribution; these powers reside with the state’s Covid-19 Vaccine Advisory Group. He further explained that Massachusetts capped the supply of vaccine doses to local health departments at 100 per week through February and has not granted Cambridge any public vaccination sites.
On Monday, Cambridge residents over the age of 75 became eligible to receive the Covid-19 vaccine as part of the first group in Phase 2 of the state’s vaccine distribution plan, DePasquale noted.
The City Council also passed an order in support of the School Committee’s recent decision to expand in-person learning in March. Lisa Dobberteen — a Cambridge pediatrician and the medical director for the local public health department's School Health services — said there remains a lot of work to vaccinate Cambridge’s population, but the department has ample staffing to get it done.
“We’re fortunate that we have plenty of people to help vaccinate,” she said. “We have vaccines. We will find a way to get them into people’s arms.”

2020 may have been rotten, but it gave us Bridgerton — and doesn’t that make up for everything? We were all already on the couch and in our pajamas when Netflix put out this new show on Christmas day, so it just made sense to binge watch it. And it. Was. Amazing. 1800’s Regency England could not be more different from life today, but what if the Bridgerton cast exchanged their corsets and waistcoats for a crimson hoodie and sweatpants? I’m sure any of the characters would trade in balls, opera performances, gowns, feasts, and strolls through Hyde Park for dhall meals, the fake Cambridge, and its winters. So, fetch some tea and biscuits as we take a gander into which Bridgerton character would be concentrating in what subject.
NOTE: Spoiler ahead! If you’re not caught up to EPISODE 8, read further at your own risk.
Daphne Bridgerton: Comparative Literature
The most well-spoken and well-mannered character on the show would be a connoisseur of all things literature. She would eloquently and confidently stroll into an early morning class ready to examine Jane Austen or Shakespeare. Her perfectly-coordinated outfits (perhaps she would forgo the gowns for class) would stun those around her.
Eloise Bridgerton: Economics 
Eloise would be an econ snake and overachiever. Curious, feisty, and persistent, she would likely be done with assignments weeks in advance and would have no shame asking several questions in 300+ person online lectures.
Simon Basset: History of Art and Architecture 
Simon is arguably art himself, so it just makes sense for this to be his chosen concentration. Given that the house he grew up in on the show is a 450-year-old English manor, he would likely have some interesting insights to share in class. He would also be permanently pinned on your Zoom screen.
Penelope Featherington: Psychology
As a psych concentrator, Penelope, aka Lady Whistledown, would secretly be psychoanalyzing those around her — friends and professors alike — monitoring their social interactions and flirtations during lectures and labs. Her clandestine research would no doubt end up as part of her thesis, in which she would shamelessly spill all the salacious drama about the Harvard community.
Anthony Bridgerton: Special Concentration
Anthony cannot commit to anything or anyone (like a certain opera singer) on the show, so as a student he would probably struggle to find a suitable concentration. So, he would likely overwhelm himself with too many classes from too many schools and departments and try to fancy them into a special concentration.
Based on the above assessment, all STEM concentrators should probably rethink their fields of study, just in case the Bridgerton characters do show up at the College. In any case, Simon Basset would definitely be the motivation needed to get up for those 9 a.m. classes.
