After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Panorama’s execution has been less than ideal, to no fault of its own. Between Cardi B’s pregnancy, the Friday rain debacle, and Lil Wayne’s last-minute no-show, cancellation threatened to be the theme of the festival. Instead, thanks to some of the remaining acts on Sunday, the more important trend of the day was inventive instrumentation.
David Byrne’s spectacle was all about getting existential and laughing at yourself for it—that is, until a trouble arises that can’t be laughed at. Until the last song, his set was marked by farcical solemnity and a seriously impressive percussion lineup. The band circled in barefoot rituals with their African drums and guitars in tow, marching-band style. (The African-derived beat was most danceable in “I Zimbra,” a Talking Heads song.) “I Dance Like This” featured the funniest pantomiming and most mercurial sound: Jumping between gentle folkish verses and punk choruses, Byrne kept a straight face while showing off a stilted thumbs-up dance move. And he delivered an increasingly flustered philosophical rant in “Once In A Lifetime,” a Talking Heads classic, at the end of which the band broke into an exuberant celebration as if finally embracing the inevitable passage of time described in the lyrics.

The set wasn’t all absurdist, though. It was also overtly political at times. Byrne encouraged the audience to vote whenever possible. (Born in Scotland, he got his American citizenship recently, he told the crowd.) He ended with a cover of Janelle Monáe’s “Hell You Talmbout,” which enumerates the names of black Americans killed by the police. Monáe had performed the composition at the Women’s March on Washington in 2017. “Sadly, the song is still as relevant now as it was then,” Byrne said. It would have been nice if the audience were as eager to chant the names as it had been to sing “Burning Down the House.”
The electronic team that has produced instrumentation for Chance the Rapper, Justin Bieber, and King Krule performed surprising sound collages that recalled the rhythms of urban commotion. The English duo of Kai Campos and Dominic Maker was joined by singer Andrea Balency], and the group retained clarity in each layer of sound from bassline to melodious static. They bobbed around charmingly while bending over their synthesizers. Their music also brought out some of the day’s most creative dancing in the audiene. “You Look Certain (I’m Not So Sure)” started up with train-chugging sounds and Andrea Balency’s full, piercing vocals and synthesizer twirls. The entrance of horn-like synth sounds turned the sobriety to a dance party, and a brilliant drum solo drove the sonic train off the rails in the best way possible.


Muddy sound quality inhibited this Seattle folk-rock band’s gig. In concert, Frontman Robin Pecknold’s voice was folksier and more strenuous than in recording. This wouldn’t have been a downside on its own, but coupled with heavy guitar work and the burying of the drums, it contributed to the loss of the songs’ characteristic lulling lilt.

It seemed promising when they brought out The Westerlies, a trombone and trumpet quartet also from Seattle. However, they too were muffled. Sadly, it was also impossible to hear the effect of a guitar being bowed like a violin. The mountain and rain visuals behind them rang trite, living up to neither the far-reaching content of their recent album “Crack-Up” or the intriguing album art of their past. A good number of fans appeared to be singing along just so everyone could see they knew the words. On Friday, Fleet Foxes’ former drummer Josh Tillman had been scheduled to perform at the festival as Father John Misty, but the rain cancellations robbed Panorama of the chance to compare the band’s severed parts.


“Romantic” isn’t usually the word for electronic music, but Odesza nailed the sentiment. Night fell over their space cinema-aesthetic backdrops. The strangely sensual sci-fi beats of their latest album, “A Moment Apart,” were made even more majestic by an emotive, shiny, almost desperate live trombone. A track that they described as “a new one just for you guys” dragged a little but continued to intensify the dreaminess. Like Byrne, Odesza used a marching-band drumline, but this one stoically performed in-place choreography, swinging at the drums as if beheading them in slow motion. The Odesza drumline is so notable it even has its own Instagram page. In fact, the entire set was post-worthy, with its digital exploding fireworks and theatrically silhouetted musicians.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students and alumni of Harvard Law School appear to be divided over the nomination of Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court.
Students at the school, where Kavanaugh taught as a visiting professor for many years, have circulated two contrasting letters in recent weeks — one praising Kavanaugh’s character and another opposing his nomination.
Before he was a Supreme Court nominee, Kavanaugh spent recent years teaching Harvard Law students about the court he is likely about to join. President Donald Trump nominated Kavanaugh, now a judge on the D.C.-based federal appeals court, for the country’s highest court last month. The U.S. Senate must now confirm Kavanaugh before he can take a seat on the bench.
Less than two weeks ago, a group of his former students sent a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee praising Kavanaugh’s presence in the classroom, calling him “a rigorous thinker, a devoted teacher, and a gracious person.”
The letter focused solely on Kavanaugh’s character during his time spent teaching at the Law School and did not explicitly recommend that the Senate confirm him.
Eighty former and current students of Kavanaugh signed the letter.
But this week, former and current Law School students  are speaking out against his nomination in a different letter.
More than 200 current and former Harvard Law School students have signed the open letter, which is addressed to Law School Dean John F. Manning ‘82 and the “Harvard Law School leadership.”
That letter came in response to the original letter praising Kavanaugh.
“While a small group of HLS students expressed their personal admiration for Judge Kavanaugh’s teaching abilities, we wish to make it known that many members of the Harvard community staunchly oppose his nomination to the most powerful bench in the country” the letter stated.
Haley Adams, a signatory of the letter opposing Kavanaugh’s nomination, wrote in an email Wednesday that the purpose of the letter was to show that a “large portion” of the Law School community did not support the nomination of Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
“The letter was meant to make it clear that a large portion of HLS did not feel represented by the administration's celebration of Kavanaugh's nomination, nor by the students who spoke out lauding his teaching style,” Adams wrote.
“We wanted to make it clear that a much larger portion of the HLS community does not believe that increased proximity to power or institutional prestige should outweigh the extreme harm that a Justice Kavanaugh would cause,” she added.
In an interview last month prior to the release of the critical open letter, former law student Colleen Roh Sinzdak praised Kavanaugh’s accessibility at the Law School.
“He was very, very available for students during office hours and things. He would basically be in his office after class every day and he’d encourage people to come by and talk to him and meet with him,” Roh Sinzdak said.
Roh Sinzdak is one of the organizers of the letter authored by former students of Kavanaugh and could not immediately be reached for comment regarding the critical open letter.
At the Law School, Kavanaugh has taught a course on the separation of powers from 2008 to 2015 and one on the Supreme Court starting 2014.
Manning congratulated Kavanaugh and thanked him for his “superb teaching” at the Law School in a statement posted on the Law School’s website after Kavanaugh’s nomination.
“As the Williston Lecturer on Law, he has brought rigor and openness to his ever-popular courses on Separation of Powers and the Supreme Court,” Manning said.
Manning declined to comment on the open letter.
If Kavanaugh is confirmed by the Senate, every justice on the Supreme Court would have attended Harvard or Yale Law School; Kavanaugh’s J.D. from Yale would take the place of Kennedy’s law degree from Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Government department committee tasked with analyzing department culture in the wake of multiple sexual harassment allegations against retired Government professor Jorge I. Dominguez released its first report to department affiliates Monday.
The report details the creation of a new lecture series starting fall 2018 as well as preliminary plans for a departmental climate survey. The document also includes agendas and possible interim steps for the group’s seven subcommittees, as the group prepares for the release of its final report by spring 2019.
Dubbed the Committee on Climate Change, the Government department formed the fifteen-member group in March, days after the Chronicle of Higher Education reported that at least 18 women are accusing Dominguez of sexual misconduct over a period spanning decades.
In the wake of the allegations, many department affiliates said they were frustrated the department had allowed Dominguez to advance, even though he was briefly sanctioned for sexual harassment in the early 1980s.
The committee — chaired by Government professor Steven R. Levitsky and comprising faculty, staff, graduate students, and undergraduates — met twice in April and outlined seven issues to investigate. The group split into seven subcommittees to address issues including reviewing departmental procedures for addressing harassment, improving inclusivity, and diversifying staff and course materials.
Government Department Chair Jennifer L. Hochschild said the purpose of the Monday report is “just to get it to the public arena with where we stand in regard to the work we need to do, rather than reporting on the work that's been done.”
Levitsky described the report as a “to-do list” and said the committee released it so that government affiliates could provide feedback.
“We're hoping that the agenda that we've come up with and have begun to work on is more or less in line with the broader community, and we want to get feedback from the community if it's not,” Levitsky said.
One agenda item to come out of the report is a departmental climate survey, which the committee plans to work on with Harvard’s Office of Institutional Research. The survey will likely include “a battery of questions about individuals’ experiences with harassment and reporting harassment” as well as questions about student-faculty interactions and space to provide recommendations for improving the department’s environment, according to the report.
“It will provide a bunch of our subcommittees with really important information about where to go,” Levitsky said. “We can't have a full understanding of where to go in terms of reforms, policy reforms, until we have a better understanding of the nature and extent of the problem.”
Two subcommittees — one focused on promoting an inclusive climate and one on making the Government department less hierarchical — have developed a seminar series, according to the report. The series is set to begin this fall and will feature outside scholars presenting “cutting edge research from across all disciplinary subfields” followed by a social gathering.
The report notes that as department-wide events, the seminars could act as “an opportunity to model inclusive behavior,” and could also provide the opportunity for department affiliates to hear from a diverse group of scholars.
The subcommittee tasked with reviewing the department’s performance on issues of sexual harassment recommended an “internal study of the department’s oversight mechanisms” as well as an “external review.”
The “internal study” would use public historical records to examine the department’s policies established in the past several decade. While the report calls an independent review “essential to moving forward,” both Levitsky and Hochschild said it is uncertain whether such an external review will feasible.
“The thing about an external review is it requires first and foremost funding from the administration, from the FAS or university administration,” Levitsky said.
The University is currently conducting a review of the allegations against Dominguez. Days after the publication of the Chronicle articles, former Dean of FAS Michael D. Smith announced that Dominguez had been put on paid “administrative leave” pending the results of the investigation. Dominguez retired at the end of the spring semester.
While the committee’s report explicitly states their own review “would not investigate facts specific to the Jorge Domínguez case,” Levitsky acknowledged the difficulties of separating Dominguez’s case from the topic of sexual harassment in the department, calling it one of the “trickiest issues.”
“That possibility, that there would be sort of bleeding over into the Dominguez case is one reason why many people are reluctant or skeptical about our ability to do an external investigation,” Levitsky said. “The one problem we're still trying to sort out is how not to intersect with the investigation.”
The committee plans to present a summary of its progress at one of the faculty meetings in the fall and will create public avenues for feedback from department affiliates, including the possibility of a town hall meeting.
Hochschild said she feels “terrific” about the committee’s work so far.
“I think the meetings so far have been substantive, have been thoughtful, have been generally trying to sort out what to do about these complex and controversial issues. They've got to-do lists, they're doing some of their own research,” Hochschild said. “They're moving along.”
Correction: August 31, 2018
A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that FAS is conducting a review of the allegations against Government Professor Jorge I. Dominguez. In fact, the University is conducting a review of the allegations against Dominguez.
