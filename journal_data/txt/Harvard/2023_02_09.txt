After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Crimson recently attended roundtable discussions with Dave Franco, Alison Brie, and Jay Ellis to discuss their upcoming film “Somebody I Used to Know.” Just in time for Valentine’s Day, real-life couple and co-writers Alison Brie and Dave Franco set out to create a love story that includes the elements everyone appreciates about a romantic comedy while also being “surprising and unique,” according to Franco, who is also the director.
In the film, type-a workaholic Ally (Brie) is reeling from the cancellation of “Dessert Island,” the reality show she spent three years of her life working on non-stop. So she packs up and returns to her small hometown in Washington State, where she soon runs into Sean (Ellis), her ex-boyfriend. The two instantly reconnect and Ally rethinks her previous decision to break up and move to Los Angeles to pursue her career goals. This makes it all the more surprising for her to learn that Sean is now engaged to the younger, free-spirited Cassidy (Kiersey Clemons).
Following Franco’s directorial debut “The Rental” in 2020, which Brie also starred in, the couple continued to search for ways to collaborate on a project again. “In terms of why it works, we just have similar sensibilities and we have the same sense of humor,” Franco said. According to Franco, they set out to write a romantic comedy because it is a genre they both love. They sought to incorporate nostalgic elements from their favorite films of the ’80s and ’90s, Franco said, “movies like ‘Pretty Woman,’ ‘When Harry Met Sally,’ ‘My Best Friend’s Wedding,’ ‘Sleepless in Seattle.’”
The premise might sound like a typical Hallmark movie, but Franco and Brie purposefully deviate from many rom-com tropes as the story unfolds. “We just wanted to make something a little more complicated and a little messier,” Franco said. In order to make the story modern and relatable, all three main characters find themselves wrestling with balancing careers and personal desires.
Ellis, who is coming off of projects such as “Top Gun: Maverick” and “Insecure,” said he is really drawn to characters such as these. “We’re different and have different qualities but there’s something about them and their experiences that I ultimately learn from.”
Also, rather than simply portraying two women fighting over a man, one of the most developed relationships in the film is between Ally and Cassidy, the former seeing elements of her past self in the latter. Brie said, “With [Cassidy] we were trying to play with the classic rom-com tropes of the bride and humanize her and also make her really cool and interesting and not a stereotype.” The two even share a moment Brie described as “intimate.”
Additionally, Brie discussed the concept of career anxiety, which can resonate with everyone, including successful actors like Brief herself. “It’s probably not a coincidence that Ally’s show gets canceled after a third season, when she thinks there's gonna be a fourth, and we wrote this right after ‘GLOW’ got canceled, after we had shot the first two episodes of our fourth season,” she said.
The parallels between Brie’s and Allie’s experiences don’t end there. A running theme throughout the movie is nudity, as Ally’s true passion before her reality show was creating a documentary on a nudist colony. This was an early idea in the movie’s creation since Brie and Franco wanted to include some detail referencing Brie’s time at “a very progressive liberal arts school,” Franco said. “She would streak across campus to make her friends laugh.”
Now that the movie’s release is imminent, what’s next for Franco? “I need just a small break from directing just because it’s so all consuming,” he said. “I’m really excited to get back to acting.” Franco also stated his desire to re-enter the horror genre and said that he and Brie are “already developing” other projects. The two certainly remained energetic and excited for the movie’s release, as Franco popped back into the roundtable to kiss his wife goodbye for the day before signing off.
“Somebody I Used to Know” will be available to stream Feb. 10 on Amazon Prime Video.

Ballet has a look. Not only does it evoke images of glittering sugar plum fairy costumes and bubblegum-pink tutus in the heads of audiences young and old, but the way those characters look is just as burned into the public’s consciousness. People are used to being entranced by tableaus of The Ballerina: the covertly strong, lean, dainty girl floating around stages across the world from Moscow’s Bolshoi to the American Ballet Theatre. They are different names of the same face — and body. Ballet has an ultra-rigid set of criteria for its top dancers, and those who don’t meet this specific body standard cannot participate in the elite form. Does the way that we think about ballet need to change? Marcus Schulkind, a professor at The Boston Conservatory at Berklee, thinks so.
Although Schulkind’s resume — which includes a stint at Juilliard, a position working with Martha Graham, and a professorship at one of the most elite conservatories in the country — suggests that he’s been dancing his entire life. His path to dance boldly fouettes in the face of the current blueprint, showing that anyone with enough passion can be an accomplished dancer. While most famed dancers start with the discipline when they can barely walk, Schulkind picked up dancing at 17, becoming “enamored” with the artform and improving exponentially. He quickly moved from The Goddard School to a Juilliard audition with the assurance from his mentor that he would be “the worst person there” if he made the cut — which he did.
But observing the greats makes the true greats-in-waiting even greater, and Schulkind quickly found success in the conservatory and company machine after moving from Juilliard to Batsheva. And while his recent strides have included things that may seem typical of accomplished dancers — like starting his own conservatory, his own studio, and taking a professorship — he offsets teaching the next generation by poking them through his acupuncture business. But not only does Schulkind’s unconventional path deserve praise for his own achievements; it also defines his teaching style.
Schulkind envisions a future for ballet that’s just as unique and diverse as his own circumstances. In an interview with The Harvard Crimson he spoke on the importance of establishing a “yin yang” relationship between dance, health, and “movement and energy,” citing his acupuncture work as the catalyst for making him more aware of this vital connection.
“One is the dance, which is the external energy, and then I work with internal energy, which is acupuncture — all the time — and so it totally changed my teaching skills, and I thought it was really important as a choreographer and as a dancer that if I hurt someone or someone got hurt, I could fix them.”
However, Schulkind’s propensity towards healing does not stop at physical health. His background has led him on a quest to heal the broken pieces of the dance world.
The old standard of the ballet system has distilled what it means to be a ballet dancer into the hyper-specified look and measurements of the body: again, the long, strong, and lean Ballerina reigns supreme. However, the sacrifices that dancers make to maintain this physique often lead to bodily and psychological harm.
“If you’re coming from one of the five major ballet schools in the world, there is unfortunately a stereotypical body type that is not only liked but actually is considered the only body type that should do this,” Schulkind said.
“We need not to be saying that someone has to be weighed every week, and if they’re not, then actually causing them specific body harm, and causing them harm not just to their body, but to mentality,” he added. “I don’t do that, I’m not interested in that.”
The abuse that many of these company ballerinas face is often ignored by a dance world led by an old generation who want to see the 147-year-old “Swan Lake” simply because it’s a centuries-old tradition. But Schulkind posits that it’s time to change that perspective. Ballet needs to reckon with its harmful expectations and move into a more sustainable future.
“It doesn’t really read to the truth of where we are right now, and we need to move along,” he said.
But the only way to truly soften the rigidity of the system is by completely overhauling its antiquated structure, and, much like the dancer, heal it wholly. Although the task of re-examining ballet may be daunting, Schulkind simply advises that we must look for the work that exposes and seeks to treat the wounds of our times. Whether that be a retelling of an old standard or something completely new, dance only evolves when it’s at its healthiest — when it's addressing something real. Prokofiev wrote “Cinderella” in response to the strife of World War II, and Stravinsky’s “The Rite of Spring,” composed in the political firestorm pre-World War I, famously inspired a riot on its opening night, so whether the next great ballet addresses the war in Ukraine or the rise of facism in modern America, the public must be ready to accept a new framework with healthier dancers and a healthier system, as Marcus Schulkind has been waiting for years to.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This review contains major spoilers.
Octavia E. Butler has an extraordinary catalog full of critically acclaimed novels that rightfully led her to be regarded as one of the greatest authors of the 20th century and one of the first African American women to be accepted into the genre of science fiction. Butler dedicated her work to exploring and dissecting Black narratives, making her work timeless and popular amongst several generations. This can be seen in several of her books including “Kindred”, which was published in 1979 and inspired a Hulu series of the same name that released last December.
The novel consisted of an intriguing and educational story about Dana, a Black woman living in 1976 Los Angeles who unexpectedly time travels to 19th century Maryland, where she meets her ancestors, including a young white boy, Rufus, who is the son of a slave master and whose life she is expected to save. The story reveals both the nature of slavery and racism in the 19th century as well as how this legacy continues to affect African Americans today.
The TV series “Kindred,” which premiered on Dec. 13th of last year, was created by Branden Jacobs-Jenkins — known for his plays “Appropriate” and “An Octoroon” — and aimed to modernize her novel. His changes raise questions around the depiction of slave narratives, the right way to adapt Black classics, and the inclusion of Black trauma and stereotypes in media.
The first big jump that Jacobs-Jenkins took in this series was the literal time jump to 2016. Since Butler’s story is set in 1976 and she herself passed away in 2006, it is apparent that her words and experiences are decades removed from the time period in this adaptation. This changes everything, as the resources and technology the characters have to survive are different, creating scenes like Dana listening to music with an iPhone and earbuds despite being in antebellum slave times.
Jacobs-Jenkins believed this time jump would help pay homage to the last 40 years since Octavia E. Butler’s book was published, saying “a contemporary Black woman isn't a Black woman from 20 years ago, or a Black woman from 40 years ago. If you put them all next to each other, what are the commonalities and where are the divergences?"
Another change he made that was key to the plot of Butler’s novel was the relationship between Dana and her white partner Kevin who eventually gets brought to the 19th century with her. In Butler’s book, Kevin was Dana’s husband of a few years, and they lived together as writers in Los Angeles. This deep relationship and Kevin's whiteness allow him to attempt to help her when he is also taken back to antebellum America, like when he attempted to write her free papers. In the show, Kevin is instead a recovering alcoholic who meets Dana, as her restaurant server, for the first time in the season premiere.
Butler’s novel used this relationship to emphasize race relations in the 1970s (which is why the date change alters the theme), revealing controversy around interracial marriage, whereas Jacob-Jenkins’s modern take lacks Butler’s depth and nuance. Yet in doing so he also removed the ability for a Black woman protagonist to be in a healthy relationship with an equal. Kevin in the television series differs extremely from the character in the book as he is utterly useless, looking to Dana and the other enslaved people for everything, to the point where a young Black girl protects him with a gun. Dana is depicted as the “controlling and aggressive angry black woman” stereotype, as Jacobs-Jenkins makes her lose her cool and yell at Kevin, while she also struggles to navigate a new territory without any love, care, or meaningful support.
Jacobs-Jenkins robs Dana’s character of dignity also, as she basically takes in and emotionally depends on a grown man she doesn’t know and who depends on her for everything when they transition. Both Dana and Kevin in Butler’s books are intellectuals who compliment each other as they endure the unthinkable, while in the adaptation they not only have very little chemistry or history, but seemingly very little alliance to each other.
At one point Dana forces Kevin back to the past with her by holding him hostage as he begs her to let him go. This unnecessary conflict is distasteful as Dana, who Butler writes as a victim to her situation, is now an accomplice and characterized with arguably more malice than some of the actual antagonists.
Kevin also shows he has little care for Dana as he makes friends with the slave masters and other people who are causing deliberate harm. Butler’s depiction of a strong and supportive interracial relationship was symbolic of the lasting effects of slavery and one of the many ways ideologies of the past impact the present. These choices were inappropriate to the tone and material of the show, and produced an arguably an offensive depiction of how a white partner should understand their Black partner’s pain.
This relationship wasn’t the only one that suffered in this adaptation, as Jacob-Jenkins added characters and storylines that complicated the plot and distorted Butler’s vision. Unlike in the novel where Dana's parents passed away, and the few relatives she and Kevin have do not support their relationship, Jacobs-Jenkins creates an entirely new storyline where Dana’s mom didn’t pass away but was actually also forced to travel to the 1800s.
This plot not only overcomplicates things as he spends too much time on Dana’s mom’s backstory and the technicality of how this time travel works, but he once again characterizes Dana poorly as she becomes jealous of the care her mom shows to the slaves on the plantation when she feels abandoned.
The inclusion of Dana’s mom was a lazy way to solve plot conflicts: Her house and her mom were always available for Dana to run to whenever issues arose, while Butler made Dana deal with these issues head on to expose the audience to the plights of slavery.
Jacobs-Jenkins also changes the dynamic between Dana’s aunt, uncle, and Kevin’s sister in his adaptation. The sister, who Butler characterized as racist, becomes a worried civilian who happens to call the cops to Dana’s house out of concern for the safety of her brother and is presented as sympathetic, while Dana’s aunt and uncle become the mean relatives who want to control Dana, refuse to listen to her, and threaten Kevin.
If this wasn’t enough, Jacobs-Jenkins also includes a useless story plot about nosey neighbors who seem to be coded as modern day “Karens,” because they show a unique amount of attention to Dana, who is one of the only Black residents in the neighborhood she moved into at the start of the show. Unfortunately, the employment of this storyline is confused, as Jacobs-Jenkins simultaneously raises issues of stereotyping and law enforcement while also presenting the overbearing white neighbors as well-meaning. This unclear direction results in the failure of both ideas.
Jacobs-Jenkins’s “Kindred” sabotaged the meaning of Butler’s work with absurd humor and entertainment, raising questions about just how appropriate it is to include comedy in a series confronting slavery. A lot of creators get criticism about including Black trauma into their work for the purpose of shock and controversy, while others are critiqued for unrealistic depiction and a lack of seriousness. Jacobs-Jenkins surprisingly can be criticized about both.
Aside from the absurd humor, including a random reference to the “Chipettes,” from the “Alvin and the Chipmunks” franchise, Jacobs-Jenkins depicts slavery as something Dana easily became accustomed to, as her worst conflicts included an argument with another Black woman on the plantation, her relationship drama, and her obsessive care for Rufus. Twisting Butler’s words to unnecessarily pit two Black women against each other while making Dana a mother figure to Rufus is extremely disappointing, turning Butler’s work into a drama riddled with stereotypes when slavery is a horror with many facets (of which very few were unpacked).
The scenes of which Jacobs-Jenkins included to show the reality of slavery were not even present in the book nor necessary for the understanding of the series. For example, the show depicts the death of two slaves: A baby and his mother during childbirth and the forced sexual assault of a slave woman by an enslaved man. Both situations only enforced horrible narratives and representation while not serving a clear narrative purpose, only trivializing Black pain.
Jacobs-Jenkins only included about one third of Butler’s book in the first season, which is unfortunate especially since the show was canceled by FX on Jan. 30th. Leaving audiences on a cliff-hanger and more importantly uneducated, is exactly what the dangers of splitting an author’s text into pieces are. Butler’s work has not been done justice, and it will not be unless another network picks it up.
Jacobs-Jenkins, while hoping “this show just helps people cut through the fallacies they have” about slavery and racism, perpetuates harmful narratives with his series. “Kindred” is often used as a novel to educate students about Butler’s work and how aspects of slavery linger into modern-day life. Butler even starts her book with the ending, proving that the plot of this work is not what's important, but rather the message she conveys with her well thought out characters, their relationships, and the specifically chosen setting and time period, all of which the adaptation fumbles.
This brings up the questions of what responsibilities come with choosing to adapt a text that is not only well-regarded, but is also used to smartly convey many social issues that were relevant to the author and certain demographics. Many Black women find comfort and community in Octavia E. Butler’s works, finding themselves represented in storylines that transcend generations. The title of “Kindred” emphasizes this very aspect of Black life.
It is a text about a Black woman discovering her ancestry, making meaningful “kin,” — an idea that is powerful because developing kin during slavery was a way of protest. When slave owners tried to strip away their humanity and dignity, enslaved people formed families and held meaningful relationships that preserved our values, culture, and are one reason why our ancestral roots have branched into the beautiful relationships we have today. These stories must be treated carefully, and if they must be changed, it must be in a way that takes cultural context, difficult conversations, and, most importantly, the people whose stories are being represented into consideration.

Rapper YL is breathing life into the New York underground with his vintage fashion sense and effortless, throwback-inspired raps. Born and raised in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, YL blends Golden Era sounds, ’90s street style, and contemporary drill to create something entirely new. The result is a sound that distinctly represents the aesthetics of New York City life. In recent years, the Chelsea rapper has become a leading name in the world of ’90s-inspired NYC fashion bringing the look into a new generation. In 2021, he was tapped to appear in ad campaigns for two prominent NYC-based luxury streetwear releases: Awake x New Era and New Balance x Aimé Leon Dore.
Last month, YL headlined a packed show at Elsewhere in Brooklyn with longtime collaborator Starker. “It's amazing because it was in my city,” YL said in an interview with The Harvard Crimson. “I know how it is when you’re from out of state they sometimes appreciate you in a different way.”
YL was first introduced to hip-hop by his older brother who played him ’90s legends like The Diplomats and Jay-Z. As he developed his own taste, YL took a liking to Nas, Jadakiss, and early Eminem before becoming an MC himself. The rapper began making music with a group of friends at the end of high school. “Just being around the energy of seeing my homie make a song was crazy,” YL said. “I just felt like that was the illest thing.”
After high school, YL began to seriously hone his rapping chops and lay the foundation for his label collective, RRR — an acronym for “Real Recognize Real.” RRR has been affiliated with YL’s brand for over a decade and is the moniker assigned to the rapper’s collaborative partnerships with rapper Starker and producers Zoomo and Noface.
Around 2012, YL met Starker at a basement party in Queens. Connecting again through mutual friends, the pair started to make music and went on to release their first full length collaboration 2015’s “Lo.Ceasar.” YL shared that his collaborative partnership with Starker has been easy and natural since the beginning.
In Nov. of last year, YL, Starker, and Zoomo independently released “RRR: The Album,” a posse project that demonstrates the trio’s undeniable chemistry.
“RRR was probably already a thing like 10 years ago when it was just homie shit,” YL said. “As time progressed, I felt like my heart became super involved in it. Then, I met Starker, who I felt like was a real missing piece for me.”
“We were already working on ‘Lo.Ceasar’ like the first couple times that we linked up,” YL added. “By the third time we were chilling, we was already making joints. We would just record at my crib all summer.”
Zoomo entered the picture in 2018 after YL connected with the North Carolina producer on Instagram. The beatmaker quickly became one of YL’s go-to producers and the musical backbone of RRR. For the last couple years, production from Zoomo and guest verses from Starker have been baked into YL’s music-making formula. Zoomo makes sample-based boom bap beats that support YL’s straightforward delivery while contrasting with Starker’s rambunctious flow. “It just felt like when I was making music with Starks we never spoke about what we were writing about,” the rapper said. “It just came together perfectly all the time. Even with Zoomo, he was just playing the type of beats that were like where I was trying to take my music.”
One of YL’s greatest strengths is his versatility. Over the last year, he has expanded his wheelhouse of collaborators to include Filipino singer-songwriter EYEDRESS and Jersey Club-inspired producers Subjxct 5 and Tony Seltzer. The rapper’s Nov. 2021 project, “Soda Club,” features production from Subjxct 5 and Seltzer that blends throwback sample-based beats with the high energy of modern drill. It’s a formula that has recently been taken mainstream through Lil Uzi Vert’s 2022 single “Just Wanna Rock.”
The diversity of the rapper’s discography makes it hard to categorize YL into any single genre. “I like to call it ‘slice of life,’” YL said. “That's on whatever beat that I choose to get on, I feel like the context or the content is always me. I love to rap. I like making all kinds of music. I would get bored if I had to rap on a loop beat everyday for the rest of my life.”
With his next full length project, “Don’t Feed the Pigeons,” YL plans to blend the sounds he’s been working with over the last few years: sample-based loops and Jersey Club. It is a project that the rapper claims will simultaneously satisfy his diehard fans and earn him new listeners.
“It's really one of those albums where there's something for everybody,” YL said. “I'm not trying to be like any other artists… I'm trying to make something that can only be identified as some YL shit.”

As the sun set on Jan. 31, an eager albeit shivering crowd formed in front of the Sinclair, awaiting the music and spectacle of Ali A.Sethi ’06. Though doors didn’t open until 7 p.m., the line began to take shape early as concertgoers arrived at the Church Street entrance from all directions. There was a familial camaraderie in the air: People regaled each other with warm stories from South Asia and the diaspora; someone mentioned how, had we been in Pakistan, there would be a line of hot chai-toting vendors outside the concert venue, making the most of the crowd of chattering teeth.
The show opened with a performance by Ria Modak ’22 on vocals/guitar and Devon N. Gates ’23 on bass. “Have we ever had our hearts broken?” Modak laughingly asked the audience, and was met with sentimental cheers.
Their opening set paid homage to musical and literary figures of South Asia, including legendary Pakistani ghazal singer Mehdi Hasan and 15th century mystic poet Kabir. The audience candidly interacted with Modak’s and Gates’s performance, iterating the cultural tradition of the mehfil. “Kabir wrote a lot of poetry about the things that matter in life…which is nothing we can actually put into words,” Modak said.
When Sethi took the stage, he seamlessly continued this homage to South Asian culture by beginning with a couplet from one of the most influential Urdu poets, Mirza Ghalib: “Muddat huī hai yaar ko mehmāñ kiye hue,” or, “It has been a long time since my lover was a guest of mine.“ Ever the charming performer, Sethi said to the crowd that they are his mehmāñ (guests) tonight and that the group are so delighted to see all of us.
Though playfully dramatic and constantly making jokes, latent in Sethi’s onstage persona was a humble sincerity, as if he were performing at a small family gathering and not a sold out venue. It was incredible to witness the artist behind the most hummed-to Google search song of 2022 crack jokes and encourage his crowd to sing with him. “I don’t even know how to use iCloud,” he confessed at one point. “I have thousands of voice notes in this phone, even my riyaz with Farida Khanum. No back up, no nothing. This dil (heart) is my backup.”
He recounted his years of training in the Hindustani classical tradition, when he was just starting out on what would become an illustrious and global career. He recalled that his ustād (teacher) would say to him: “Karne se hi āyegā. (Only through doing will it come.) Dance the dance, and one day you will wake up dancing the dance. And that’s the only way."
Sethi’s musical set was as colorful as his energy. It ranged from a voicing of George Michael’s disco pop to the Punjabi folk tradition of luddi; from the stripped down ballad ‘Khabar-e-Tahayyur-e-Ishq’ to the soaring, stomping, powerhouse “Pasoori.” Breaking down musical and cultural barriers is nothing new for Sethi. Even still, it had a dizzying effect, channeling ecstasy into the audience, who was left with throats sore from cheering and singing along. And Sethi seemed blissfully aware of this effect: “How’s everyone doing?” he said in between numbers. “That’s my way of saying, ‘zindā ho? (you alive?)’”
Many concertgoers likely discovered Sethi from his sensational 2022 hit “Pasoori,” but one got the sense that equally as many had been following his work for a long time, and sang along to every word of his songs from years past. Sethi, himself, expressed gratitude at “Pasoori”’s success while also poking fun at it becoming synonymous, in some circles, with his name. “I will not let Pasoori define me,” he joked. “I binge Pasoori, then I withdraw from Pasoori.”
Sethi brought a charged air of storytelling to his performance, enriching the music and creating an extraordinary intimacy with his audience. His skill at imbuing emotion into a crowd was as palpable as his genre-defying musical prowess. In a brief throwaway comment, Sethi quite cleverly, if not also unintentionally, encapsulated his persona, both on and offstage: “thodā drama honā chāhiye,” or, “there’s gotta be a bit of drama.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the release of her debut single “Smoke Alarm,” on Jan. 20, Northeastern University Student Madison Bequer became the newest player in the Boston music scene. In an interview with The Harvard Crimson, the singer-songwriter recounted her music journey and shared her experience balancing school and music.
Despite a fascination with music since early childhood, Bequer’s passion for songwriting originated in the poems and stories she wrote. Citing a lack of confidence in her singing voice, she didn’t venture into making music until the Covid-19 pandemic, when she chose to apply to Northeastern’s music program.
“When COVID happened, it actually helped me realize that I did want to do music, for good, and not anything else,” Bequer said.
Thinking about her life’s trajectory led Bequer to many existential crises. She wanted to make sure she would be happy doing whatever it is she chose. Unsure of her potential, she decided to push herself and pursue singing.
“I just have to do this, because if I don’t I’m always going to wonder what would have happened if I did do it.” Bequer said, stating that her confidence started growing after committing to music.
Northeastern’s song-writing courses played a large role in developing Bequer’s confidence along with her songwriting skills, making it possible for her to release music. Her peers and faculty taught Bequer to get comfortable sharing her work and grew her confidence.
“I had this really amazing teacher,” Bequer said of David McWane, lead singer of Boston-based band Big D and The Kids Table. McWane provided insightful feedback on Bequer’s song. With his advice, she began to think “maybe I’m better than I think I am.”
For many college students, creative passions and academics often conflict. But Bequer found it critical that her academic and creative goals align. While many of Bequer’s skills are self-taught, her classes provided her with useful information and opportunities, like having peers listen to her songs and learning about technical production.
“The very base idea of sharing my music with other people and not getting nervous, that vulnerability, I only could have learned through doing it at school,” said Bequer.
Making music in an academic setting motivated Bequer to get out of her comfort zone while giving her the tools to complete the songs she wanted to make. She self-produced her debut single “Smoke Alarm,” citing a recording class she took as an invaluable resource for learning how to use software like Logic and Pro Tools.
“If I didn’t do this program, I don’t think I would have released a song,” Bequer said.
While Boston has a vibrant indie and folk music scene, Bequer asserts that her music doesn’t fit the Boston mold. She doesn’t identify with its sound as a consumer or creator of music.
“I don’t think I really make that kind of music. I don’t know what genre you’d put my music in, but I don’t think that’s it,” Bequer said.
Regardless of her unwillingness to fit the mold, Bequer has found people she enjoys doing shows and making music with, her lifeline towards connection.
“It’s not my favorite of the music scenes I’ve been a part of but there are really amazing people in it,” Bequer said, determined to make her own niche in Boston’s music community.
Expressing difficult emotions has been uncomfortable for Bequer, and finding a way to share them is what inspires her songs.
“The driving factor is literally what I’m feeling. Music and lyric writing is kind of the only way I can adequately express those things,” she said.
Bequer is continuously working on new music. “I just wrote a song yesterday,” she said, after mentioning her hope to release an EP in the future. Excited by the feedback she received from playing her work-in-progress in class, Bequer plans to include that song on her upcoming project.
Bequer’s first foray into music creation is certainly not her last. From being hesitant to share her songs with her family, to releasing a single and working on an EP, Bequer has evolved into a confident artist with the help of her own will and her college’s resources. Determined to pursue music and driven by the desire to express herself, Bequer stands poised to grow her burgeoning musical niche.

Brooklyn rapper Starker has established himself as one of the most consistent and well-regarded names in the New York underground rap scene. Recently, Starker’s fashion prowess and music releases — including a full length project with longtime collaborator YL and producer Zoomo — have caught the eye of industry influencers. The rapper is one of the foremost collectors of vintage Polo Ralph Lauren in the world. In 2021, Teddy Santis’s Aimé Leon Dore enlisted Starker for their 2021 New Balance x Aimé Leon Dore ad campaign. Last year, the Brooklyn MC painted the cover art for Westside Gunn’s July 2022 album “Peace ‘Fly’ God” with his friend and collaborator, Masschussetts rapper al.divino. Starker’s raspy delivery, DIY aesthetic, and distinct NYC fashion sense has garnered him an ever-growing cadre of diehard fans, both in his hometown and abroad.
Despite his New York roots, Starker has found a creative haven and committed listenership in Japan. In 2017, Starker played his first solo show in Morioka, Japan, despite making music for close to a decade prior. “It probably changed my life forever,” Starker said in an interview with The Harvard Crimson. “Like Japan is one of those places that when you get there it feels like a bonus round in life.”
Starker would never have performed in Morioka had it not been for the mother of his child, who bought him a plane ticket to Japan for Valentine’s Day. The rapper had been talking to Japanese promoters and fans of his music through Instagram, but never planned to meet up with those contacts in person. “She just bought me a ticket,” the rapper said. “If it wasn't for that I wasn't going to go, I wasn't going to take that step. It didn’t make sense to jump on a fucking 18 hour flight and go to Japan. I wasn’t even getting booked in New York. My first ever solo show was in Japan.”
After returning home to NYC, Starker felt empowered and was hungry to make more music. According to the rapper, one of the projects that his Japanese fans loved the most was “Lo.Ceasar,” his 2015 debut collaboration with YL. The Japan trip reinvigorated Starker’s confidence to increase his output of solo projects and collabs with RRR, the label collective formed by Starker, YL, and producers Zoomo and Noface. Last November, RRR dropped “RRR: The Album,” an infectiously energetic posse project that highlights trio Starker, YL, and Zoomo.
“I went to Japan and got treated like an artist for the first time in my life,” Starker said. “Like I'd never gotten that in New York. If it wasn't for Japan, people in New York woulda probably kept treating me like, I'm supposed to be a fucking doorman and shit.”
“I came back and I had that confidence on me like, ‘Ain’t nothing you New York n****s could do to make me feel like I’m not a rapper because I just came back from Japan and those motherfuckers knew who I was,” the rapper added.
Starker first learned about hip-hop as a kid in Brooklyn. The rapper shared that his own upbringing closely mirrored the aesthetic of the 1994 movie “Fresh,” which takes place in Brooklyn. Starker had an aunt who was a huge Ruff Ryders fan and a father that was buying him sneakers from the time he could first walk. “That's where I come from,” Starker said. “I come from the hood. I come from Brooklyn, New York. I'm from Williamsburg, from Cooper Projects. That's where they shot the movie ‘New Jersey Drive.’ They shot that shit on my block. That wasn’t filmed in Jersey.”
Fashion is an essential aspect of Starker’s artistry. Many of his lyrics are fashion-inspired, often including shoutouts to the specific brands that define his style including Iceberg, Avirex, and vintage Polo Ralph Lauren. In fact, Starker is one of the most significant private Polo archivists in the world. Last year, the rapper was chosen as the American representative for Highsnobiety and Polo Ralph Lauren’s “Superfan” series, which profiled three international collectors of the brand. Starker has items in his collection that even Polo corporate does not have.
“I realize that high fashion uses people like me to translate their product to the masses,” Starker said. “Certain products cannot be translated without a certain medium and I’m that medium. They recognize that I could be used to their advantage like, ‘If we put clothes on this person and he wears them, the public is going to recognize it as something that they want to wear.’”
The Brooklyn rapper said that he tries to communicate his sartorial sensibility with his music. Starker views fashion as a way of speaking without words. “The only thing flyer than wearing it is saying it,” the rapper said. “Even if you can’t afford it, if you know about it, that's still pretty fly.”
Within the hip-hop underground, Starker is coveted for his curatorial ability and expert eye for style. In 2020, he worked with al.divino to draw the cover art for his album “Secrets.” The artwork features Starker’s signature cartoon pup, which he modeled after the vintage Betty Boop character Bimbo. In July 2022, Starker’s cartoon became the centerpiece in the album artwork for Westside Gunn’s full length project “Peace ‘Fly’ God.’” Massachusetts rapper al.divino painted the background of the image and worked with Starker to get the finished product to Gunn.
“It has such a cultural value to it,” Starker said. “This isn’t just some Mickey Mouse. You see the Muslim symbol of the fez. Everything’s very calculated. I feel like [Westside Gunn] knew what he was doing there by asking if he could use the character and it only benefited me and turned into a bigger thing for me.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“The Sex Lives of College Girls,” created by Mindy Kaling and Justin Noble, follows a close-knit, yet turbulently intertwined group of suitemates studying at an elite, private university. The show’s Essex College resembles Harvard University in many ways — the exclusivity, the social climbing, the pervasive effects of an immovable aristocracy in its student body. Of course, these traits are not particular only to Harvard, but to the Ivy League at large. The show is something of an Ivy League melange, especially considering creators Kaling and Noble attended Dartmouth and Yale respectively. A major function of the show is to incentivize and imagine the possibility of legitimate change within the context of these powerful institutions.
One undeniably similar aspect between the fictional Essex College and Harvard University is the depiction of “The Catullan,” — a longstanding comedy publication and a parody of The Harvard Lampoon, a semi-secret sorrento square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine. A major arc of the series follows Bela (Amrit Kaur) as she tries to join the lauded comedy magazine, overcoming a series of obstacles within the patriarchal environment.
As a result of Bela’s conflict with “The Catullan,” Bela, along with fellow female comedy writers on campus, create a female-centered comedy magazine that launches to acclaim and fanfare. This vision illustrated the possibility that an independent comedy magazine run by people who identify as women and non-binary people could achieve a comparable level of recognition to the more prominent publication that is financially bolstered by wealthy alumni. Bela and her friends make a brave choice to start another publication, while undermining the senior magazine. Whereas The Harvard Lampoon remains the dominant comedy presence at Harvard, the show questions whether the status-quo has to be the only reality.
A statue of an imposing male figure dominates the Essex College landscape, reminiscent of the statue of John Harvard. Leighton (Renée Rapp) receives 100 hours of community service for vandalizing the statue. Her internal conflict about her sexuality is projected onto the statue, a symbol of the patriarchal norms and heteronormativity cemented within the campus — largely by fraternities and sororities. Harvard’s oldest, most well-to-do final clubs continue to perpetuate this restrictive binary, allowing men the space to act upon their whims and garner more power among themselves. On the other hand, other co-ed final clubs and RSOs at Harvard accept a wider, more diverse range of people. The idea of the patriarchal statue dominating the institutional landscape remains as these exclusive clubs still stand and perpetuate antiquated social norms.
The irony of Leighton’s predicament is not lost, given her legacy status; her parents attended Essex College and encouraged her social climbing, urging her to join a sorority in order to climb the ranks, ultimately forcing her to conform to more rigid social standards. Like Essex College, a major pillar of Harvard is its acceptance of legacy students. Data from 2014-2019 indicates the increased likelihood for legacy applicants to be accepted to Harvard. Yet, Leighton finds her wealth and legacy status as a divisive point in her personal relationships, especially with Alicia (Midori Francis), her partner by the end of the second season. Leighton tries to buy her way out of conflict — to her own detriment. In depicting the dichotomy of her search for identity, the show has avoided overly sensationalizing her privilege.
Besides portraying conflict with patriarchal institutions, the show captures the value of deep female friendships that are developed between very different people that are thrown together. The unlikeliness embodies one of the best parts of the college experience — one that brings people together from a range of backgrounds and upbringings. Harvard, like Essex College, facilitates these interactions through the melting pot of cultures represented in its student identity.
Yet, the arc of the show seems to favor Kimberly (Pauline Chalamet), a white woman from a lower class background who struggles to acclimate to academics of the university, seemingly due to her public high school education. She reaches out to her suitemate’s brother ostensibly for tutoring and sets herself up for failure by taking classes she isn’t prepared for, which she gets through by cheating. As her sexual encounter with her tutor propels her towards more situationships with physically attractive men, she joins her suitemates in self-sabotage. Although private high schools certainly provide an advantage, it would be unrealistic and unfounded to say that a student that attended a public high school would be unable to academically succeed in a private college like Harvard. According to a survey of the Class of 2019, 63% of students responded that they attended a public high school before enrolling at Harvard. It would be a gross over exaggeration to say that more than half of the student body is academically unprepared based on that factor. In this way, Kimberly’s personal choices set her up for failure, as opposed to her public school education.
Kimberly’s relentless acquisition of the show’s hottest prospects is questionable, given that her other two roommates that are attracted to men, Bela and Whitney (Alyah Chanelle Scott), are women of color. Her bumbling innocence is reminiscent of “Gilmore Girls” Rory (Alexis Bledel), where her character’s selfishness lies in her pursuit of solely her own desire, without taking into consideration her friends’ needs.
In this way, the show highlights the inequity found in the type of institution it depicts by lending the straight, white main character the privilege of the show’s greatest capital — sex.
“The Sex Lives of College Girls” lives up to its name, though not too much beyond it. The main characters spend most of their mental energy worrying about sex and romance. Admittedly, intellectual pursuits do not often make for great entertainment, so the academic aspects of these girls’ lives are not developed as meticulously as their sex lives.
The “Sex Lives of College Girls” allows for a mainstream exploration of emotional and sexual growth of young women within the context of an elite institution. Under the guise of sex, the show explores more issues faced within a college environment that, on the surface, might not make for good television. The “Sex Lives of College Girls” questions that notion and throws its audience into the reality of what it means to attend a private university with a long history of legacy, money, and patriarchy.

Chobanicore (noun): authenticity as a marketing tactic, found even in the branding of your FlyBy yogurt cup. Imagine a woman standing on a balcony, holding a steaming mug. Her hair, the steam, and the leaves of lush plants all gush in the wind. Thrust into the utopia of Chobanicore through advertisements, one is forced to confront the cognitive dissonance of capitalism on a wellness retreat and design’s insidious potential.
The design-based authenticity of Chobanicore follows a decades-long lineage. Starting around the 1980s, designers copied Great Depression-era packaging and hand-lettered signs to convey the quality and materiality of American-made goods. Now, nostalgia has reintroduced this design trend into the backside of Domino’s pizza boxes, artisanal coffee shop menus, and yes — Chobani yogurt cartons.
Chobanicore’s visual language — the green and white — signals health and wellbeing. Color psychologists widely see green as a soothing color, reminiscent of nature. White has associations with cleanliness, simplicity, and new beginnings. Together, these colors brand Chobani as a wellness company.
I’ll be honest with you: I love Greek yogurt. A Costco-sized crate of it has taken up permanent residence in the corner of my fridge. It’s not Chobani’s design itself that is a problem, so much as the theoretical potential for this aesthetic approachability to spur widespread cognitive dissonance. Chobani itself is pretty much a straight-and-narrow wellness company — but similar design elements can be used to mislead.
New looks can hide old truths. Hand-lettering and specific color palettes can disarm viewers with the appearance of familiarity. These aesthetics can then be used to conceal ethical concerns, creating something shiny on the outside, but rotten to the core.
For example, in Silicon Valley, 2017-2020 ushered in Meta’s adoption of the Alegria illustration system, with flat humans with strange proportions and unnatural skin. Alegria both recalls 1980s nostalgia and introduces millennial ideals of diversity and inclusion. This provides, perhaps, the perfect cover-up for scandal.
But a big enough scandal can pull back the curtains. After the 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal, where a British consulting firm used the non-consensually gathered data of millions of Facebook users for targeted political ads, think pieces criticized Alegria for distracting Meta’s consumers from the company’s failings. Writers coined the term “Corporate Memphis:” a corporate appropriation of the 1980s Memphis Design Group’s use of geometric shapes and bright colors to bolster approachability. In the face of such a large scandal, we all saw, for once, how design had fooled us.
This column is named “AirSpace” after the plethora of aesthetic emptiness that occupies our coffee shops, offices, and hotels, and has the potential to mislead us. You can travel the entire world and never escape AirSpace — and as Harvard students, who circulate the same Cambridge spaces, have grown comfortable with the unthinking repetition of class schedules and dhall menus, and often go on to work for large corporations desperate to win Gen Z’s favor, we might be especially trapped in the AirSpace. It’s important for us to think critically about vacant design as it relates to our lives; you can start doing so the next time you’re throwing packaged foods into a green bag at FlyBy.

The Red Line’s resounding rumbles echo loudly throughout Harvard Square. The subway has an uncanny ability to make itself known in many places. The junction between Massachusetts Avenue and Linden Street, however, isn’t one of them.
Students speed through the unassuming intersection on their way to and from class, rarely taking much notice of their surroundings. Tourists, too, ignore the crossroad, their gazes shifting from the Santander Bank on one side to Zinnia Jewelry on the other as they make their way to more interesting destinations.
But if they were to stop for a moment and look down, they could see the way the scaly mosaic of the asphalt rises so that the alabaster crosswalk strips may meet the ochre curb lining. Then, like the spine of a colossal burrowing reptile, the asphalt falls again. Salt-stained graffiti and construction markings paint the textured canvas, while glinting granules reflect the winter sun.
Inside the belly of the beast, an entire subterranean universe exists. In addition to the out-of-sight subway cars hurtling toward Harvard Station, manhole covers point to the numerous utilities funneling more of the unseen through the intersection. Just out of sight, cast iron pipes carrying city water meet in a T-shaped node, and sewage is channeled away through vitrified clay casing. Arterial gas and electrical lines further contribute to the labyrinth, snaking through the network like a complex ecosystem of mangrove roots.
The Harvard steam tunnels add yet another layer of complexity.
The stuffy, walkable catacombs responsible for heating most of campus contain the only passage connecting the River to the Yard: a musty tunnel running along Linden Street and through the intricate Class of 1889 Gate on the other side. Immediately below the beautiful — yet consistently overlooked — crosswalk, this tunnel narrows into a cramped cavity, wedged under the street but above the Red Line.
Most maintenance workers go aboveground to avoid traversing the gap, but when they can’t avoid it, scattered records from five decades ago suggest that they must climb up a ladder and squeeze themselves into a rickety, rolling wooden cart. Lying flat, they inch their way through the three-foot-tall shaft by tugging themselves along using a rope on the side.
As the passageway goes on, metal beams on the ceiling tightly press down into the claustrophobic space as the cement walls, floor, and pipes all close in. The thundering of the subway tunnel it perpendicularly bisects feels uncomfortably close, and the stale heat clinging to all surfaces is stifling.
Above this world, people are lost in one of their own. They travel to and from buildings that are heated thanks to the magnificent tapestry of connections they pass over. They board trains that will rattle beneath where they just were. They see the path ahead thanks to the illuminated streetlights that are powered by the wiring woven all around them.
Unbeknownst to them all, they are united by hidden connections, their lives made easier by the unseen puzzle pieces that animate the underside of the inconspicuous intersection.
The deceptively humble corner of Massachusetts Avenue and Linden Street is a nexus, a point of convergence and emergence — both on the street and below it. People and automobiles mirror the underground traffic traveling through the infrastructure that supports them. What, for some, is a mundanity, is actually a microcosm of Harvard: a place of motion and connection, of life and energy, of the seen and unseen. And, of course, it stands as another reminder to occasionally pause and just look down.

Sturdy as stone, Harvard women’s ice hockey head coach Katey Stone has been celebrated throughout her career as one of the most successful women’s hockey coaches. Since she took over Harvard’s women hockey in 1994, Stone has marshaled the Crimson through 12 Beanpot titles, 12 NCAA tournament appearances, six ECAC tournament championships, and over 500 wins. Even as a Board with few athletic muscles to flex, we’re impressed.
But despite her barn burner of a career, a recent Boston Globe exposé threatens to undermine Stone’s outstanding athletic record. Speaking to the Globe, 16 of Stone’s past players made a collection of allegations, including that Stone cultivated a grim and hostile team culture “of complete fear,” made targeted racist remarks following a disappointing critical practice, and callously dismissed players struggling with mental health.
Further investigation from the University is warranted to assess the veracity of the accusations against Stone and provide insight and clarity on the team’s culture, so that all those involved may begin to heal. In such an incongruous but delicate situation, figuring out how to rebuild trust is the prime task at hand for the women’s ice hockey team, necessitating continuous open dialogue between Stone and her players.
In the meantime, we must take the allegations voiced in the Globe seriously. Team loyalty is a core tenet of participation in varsity sports; athletes may be hesitant to speak out, so we must listen carefully when they do. The accounts shared in the Globe vary in their perspective of Stone, but the positive recollections — 46 other former players signed a letter to the Globe in support of Stone — do not offset the negative ones.
However you slice it, though, according to several former players, the Harvard athletic director told them in 2019 that women’s ice hockey was ranked the University's worst team for athlete experience in varsity sports. This alone suggests a glaring problem with the team’s culture.
Beyond this specific team, the Globe’s reporting raises important issues for college athletics and student athlete wellbeing writ large. Athletes face tremendous public pressure to excel. Competing in a highly publicized version of Harvard’s existing stress-laden, ambitious culture, student athletes unsurprisingly not only regularly report high levels of mental health concerns, but may also hold unique mental health risk factors relating to injury and overtraining.
To be clear, collegiate athletes can and should be expected to practice and compete in high-pressure environments. The pursuit of athletic excellence definitionally requires pushing one’s body to go faster, harder, and longer, to prepare for clashes against rival teams and seemingly impossible buzzer-beaters.
Striving for athletic success and one’s full potential is a good thing — but there is a line. Pressure to the extent that athletes feel obligated to play through still-healing injuries or sacrifice all other life passions for their sport goes way over that line. We worry that these allegations against Stone paint her as passing from committed coaching into the indefensible realm of abusive behavior. Athletes should expect to be out of breath after practice or disappointed by close competitive loss — not to be belittled or minimized by coaches who should be supporting them.
College sports should never be a catalyst for mental health crises, regardless of the inherent intensity of the practice. While trophies and accolades are material indicators of competitive success, the personal experiences of players are just as — if not more — valuable and telling of a team’s triumphs. After all, a team is a reciprocal community of people, not a tool to fill a trophy case. When players teeter towards resenting the sports that shaped their formative years, something has gone terribly wrong in their collegiate training.
Schools must provide better safeguards within their sports teams to monitor team culture, coaching pedagogy, and athlete mental health. We hope the allegations levied in the Globe provide the alarm needed to build crucial supportive scaffolding into the institution of college sports. We want student athletes to find fulfillment and pride in their teams, instead of the current overwhelming pressure they weather with hearts of stone.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Around this time of year, it feels like there is immense pressure to make some sort of novel commentary about Black history. But while Black History Month is certainly a time to look back on the past, it is also a time to celebrate the triumphs of Blackness.
In brainstorming what I could write about this month, I found myself constantly thinking, “That’s too basic” or “I don’t have anything new to say.” Then I realized: Why write about something new at all? I could simply write about the things that I loved about Blackness.
In no particular order, as my way of celebrating Black History Month, here are a few of my favorite things about Blackness:
I think specifically of my mother and grandmother when writing this, but also of the countless other Black women who I have looked up to as role models.
Black women are one of the most oppressed groups in the United States. Looking strictly at the wage gap, in 2019 Black women would have had to work, on average, eight extra months per year to earn the same amount as their white male colleagues. In our nation, in which Black women are valued among the least for doing the same work, some might be inclined to give up — to lose the motivation to be educated simply to enter a dehumanizing system.
Not Black women. Census data shows that Black women, in the face of all this, are overrepresented amongst women who earn master’s degrees. This is just one example of the resilience Black women display by defying the odds stacked against them — every day. From Michelle Obama to our very own President Claudine Gay, Black women continue to raise the bar and set the standard for excellence.
From the Impressions’ “Keep on Pushing” to Solange’s “Don’t Touch My Hair," Black artists have been channeling hard times into creating uplifting music and art for years. Black art is a reminder of not only all that we have overcome, but also how ably we can express ourselves, even in the face of adversity.
Music, by turning struggles into content that a wide audience can digest, has the unique power to push Black issues into the mainstream while also serving as a healing mechanism for Black people. Expressing ourselves through music dates back to slavery. It has certainly evolved in purpose since then, but it carries much of the same power.
Whether it’s soul food, Haitian food, or Nigerian food, our cuisine is so versatile. I love its many cross-cultural influences and historical roots, despite the often painful history behind them. So much of the food from the Deep South has African roots. While much of their culture was stripped from them, slaves were able to maintain ties to their roots through food.
In thinking about the foods of my family, one that sticks out is cornbread. Today, it’s a special treat that I enjoy homemade by my mother on holidays, but for slaves it was part of a regular diet, as it was easy to prepare, portable, and wouldn’t spoil easily while working long days in the fields. Many staples of soul food have practical ties to being enslaved, and while I eat them today because they taste good, they also serve as a reminder of my ancestors’ relationship to these staples.
Admittedly, I am scared I won’t be able to pass this aspect of Black culture on to my kids, as I cannot cook at all. But for posterity’s sake, I certainly feel inclined to learn.
Black community is itself a deeply powerful force, wherever one finds themself. Even in a predominantly white space like Harvard, the very presence of Black community makes me feel so seen and heard. It can be just a nod of acknowledgement on the street or an entire party celebrating our presence in a space that was not built for us. Regardless, the coming together of our community is a force to be reckoned with.
I could go on forever about all the things I love about Blackness, but I will leave you to your own reflections. This Black History Month, take the time to appreciate Black history — but remain present, too. It is so easy to reach back into the past and marvel at how far we have come and how far we have yet to go in the fight for equality, but this month is about more than just history. It gives us the much-needed opportunity to pause, for just a moment, and appreciate the beauty of Blackness in the midst of endless struggle.

With a gigantic yellow pencil for a door handle and a nostalgic replica of the original store sign from nearly a century ago hanging above the door, University Stationery Co.’s charm is apparent before you even walk in. As you cross the threshold of the Central Square store, you’re greeted by soft rock playing on an old radio and floor-to-ceiling shelves packed with products. They have typical school and office supplies, along with an eclectic array of other items, such as Ruth Bader Ginsburg themed “Judgmints”, “Freudian Slips” Assorted Sticky Notes, Albert Einstein Pillows, and an assortment of T-shirts emblazoned with math puns.
The store’s character extends beyond its stock. Many decorative items hold a story, co-owner Gail Seidman recalls, from the pencil-shaped door handle, the artist of which died midway through its creation, to the slide rule hung on the wall in the back of the shop, which hails from an old parochial school.
The store was established in 1929 by Gail Seidman’s father, Samuel Seidman, and she began working there in 1974 after he passed away. She says that a focus on customer service and maintaining the family’s values is the secret to the store’s longevity.
Seidman says her family prioritizes “treating everyone like you want to be treated.” This carries over to their service, she adds; they make sure to “greet every customer and ask how to help” and do their best to get orders “filled accurately and right away.” She believes that a focus on customer service helps distinguish the store from larger stationery chains and the impersonal experience of online shopping.
Seidman’s favorite part of the job is getting to know customers. They hail from all over the world, she says, and the bulk of them are college students.
In addition to customer service, Seidman says a varied inventory makes the store special: they “stock as much as they can of everything,” Seidman explains, rather than only selling popular items. This vast inventory is evident from the store’s towering shelves, and, according to Seidman, they were even more packed prior to their recent move from a smaller building across the street.
When asked about goals for the future of the store, the first change that comes to Seidman’s mind is to “increase product lines” — a tall order given the current variety available. As University Stationery Co. approaches its centennial, it continues to provide wide product variety and quirky touches.

In a glass case on the Harvard Business School Baker Library’s mezzanine, a bronze statue of a Native American man in a feathered headdress sits on horseback, his head and arms raised towards the sky in a spiritual call.
This statue is a miniature version of Cyrus Dallin’s statue “Appeal to the Great Spirit”, which appears outside the Museum of Fine Arts Boston. Next to the work a plaque reads: “Dallin’s anachronistic, generalized, and romantic representation reveals much more about the artist and the prevailing Euro-American view of Native people as a ‘vanishing race’ than it does about the spiritual practices of Indigenous people living then or now.”
The Baker Library’s exhibit, “Seen and Unseen,” asks that viewers pass through a gallery of familiar misrepresentations and consider the history that they do not show. The objects — all over a hundred years old — display recognizable stereotypes, including those of the “noble savage” and the “vanishing race,” that persist into the present day.
“It’s not like Native people aren’t being seen,” Kabl Wilkerson, the exhibit’s curator explains.
“It’s drawing upon particular popular ideas, driven by stereotypes and a hefty amount of prejudice,” Wilkerson says of the exhibit “That’s really interesting because in the seeing, you are simultaneously unseeing. You are removing the ability for you to truly see who these folks are.”
Wilkerson, a second-year PhD student in Harvard’s History Department and a citizen of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation, curated the exhibit from the Baker Library archive through the Harvard Library’s Pforzheimer Fellowship. When they applied, the HBS Archives were seeking a researcher to identify and research objects for an exhibit on the representation of Indigenous peoples.
“The challenge was still there, of trying to understand the thematic thread running through all the collections,” says Wilkerson. “But somebody had to go through the gritty process of thumbing through cards and really looking at a lot of their digital collections.”
Wilkerson’s findings included many advertisements, currency, and trade cards packaged to attract customers who often collected them for scrapbooks. The artifacts are small, portable, and mundane. They passed between hands, decorated storefronts and albums, and all the while, quietly reinforced common stereotypes of “Indianness.”
For example, cards depicting each states’ founding revealed how foundational violence against Native people was in U.S. history. Their New Jersey card shows a group of settlers attacking unarmed Native Americans just below an image of George Washington, his horse rearing amid swirls of smoke and his fist triumphantly raised to the sky.
In depicting the history of each state, the trade cards are “supplementing a certain memory,” Wilkerson says. “Because what you’re seeing is not genocide. It’s necessary violence, to create the state of New Jersey or the state of New Mexico.”
In other artifacts, violence against Native peoples remains invisible, such as bills and currencies decorated with idealized versions of Westward expansion that leave out the era’s deadly Indian Wars and Indian Removal Act. Curating the exhibit also offered Wilkerson the opportunity to watch negotiations over history unfold across centuries to the present day, and themselves participate in those negotiations.
“How can I trace the kind of erasure and visible invisibility that exists?” Wilkerson says. “How can we have an understanding of the present where we have things like the Redskins juxtaposed with the Indian Child Welfare Act? These larger issues that are affecting real communities — not these imagined ones — fly under the radar and are totally subsumed by this larger American understanding of the national self.”
Pursuing this work as a Native scholar at the country’s oldest university presents its own complications. Last year, a University report revealed that Harvard holds the remains of almost 7,000 Native Americans in the Peabody Museum. News of the report broke shortly after Wilkerson began curation, and they still recall the experience vividly.
“I’m very well aware that in the Peabody’s collections there are many of my own relatives that exist from my community, that many other Native folks at Harvard also share from,” Wilkerson says. “That was actually one of the anxieties that I did have going into not just Baker, but into a Harvard archive in general. You don’t really know what might be there. And then of course, when I saw that it’s advertisements, that it’s currency — there was an immediate wash of relief that just flooded over me.”
For Wilkerson, however, their curation of the “Seen and Unseen” exhibit represented the creation of a new space within Harvard’s museum collections. The project was a chance for them, as well as the people in their community, to feel involved in the making of Harvard as a place — a process that is still ongoing.
“It’s rejecting a certain notion of invisibility that prioritizes certain narratives over others and just makes things more complicated,” Wilkerson says. “It’s nice, and it’s a privilege at that.”

“Yo! You’ve reached the voicemail of U.S. News and World Report. I can’t come to the phone right now, so leave a message at the bleepity-bloop. Later skater.”
Um, hey, U.S. News and World Report, it’s me, Harvard Medical School. I don’t exactly know how to break this to you, and it’s unfortunate that Valentine’s Day is coming up. But I realized that this year, I want to be my own valentine. Of course, I still care about you. I don’t want you to think I didn’t notice all the times you put me first. I just need to learn to put myself first. To be clear, though, it is you, and not me.
Sometimes you made me feel like the only medical school in the world. But, every now and then, reality would set in, and I could feel NYU or Johns Hopkins breathing down my neck. They were waiting in the wings — ready for me to slip. Fighting tooth and nail for your attention has distracted me from the research for which you value me so highly. But I must admit, I’m no saint. I’ve twisted and contorted myself to fit a form I believed you could love.
After shifting my decision-making from my heart to my brain, it’s all become clear now. Amid the ample acclaim surrounding your medical school rankings, I’ve often wondered what place I rank in your heart. Those are the numbers you never release. But is it so elitist to want the prime portion of your affection, your tenderness, and your devotion?
Is it too much to desire to be your one and only, and not just your number one of many? I don’t want the pedestal ranking, if the higher I go, the further I am from you. I wanted to know all of you — the good, the bad, and the truth of your methodology. Forgive me for believing this was something you were capable of revealing.
In the process, I came to see that, as little as I know about you, you know even less about me. I’m lost behind your gilded vision. For too long, I tried to diagnose you, thinking I could cure your cold demeanor. I now know better than to run an EKG on someone without a heartbeat.
I should have listened to my sister, Harvard Law School, when she told me about you. Alas, I ignored her researched argumentation and her critical examination. I knew she had a tendency to judge, but in this case, her concerns were legitimate.
I don’t need an X-ray to see right through the games you’ve been playing. I’ve come to realize your love for me will always be smaller than my acceptance rate. I’d rather be a loner with only my pet MCATs to keep me company than continue in this relationship with you.
It must take some courage to boldly rank medical schools to their faces. You’ve got enough guts to be an organ donor. But, you know, you’re not the only one who can create a ranked list. Here’s one of my own — titled “Top Reasons I’m Leaving Your Ass.”
1. You’re a high-browed snob.
2. You can find my spot on a list, but you can’t find it in bed.
3. You keep entertaining Yale.
4. You pit me against my friends.
5. You don’t deserve the brilliance of my curriculum or the curves of my grades.
Now I could end it here, but because I’m loyal unlike you, I couldn’t leave my best friend behind. So I told Columbia everything. Check your phone for the notifications; they’re leaving you too.
Now that you’re lonely, don’t try to hit me up with a half-hearted “I’m sorry.” It continues to surprise me that I’m the medical school, yet you can stitch together an excuse with better technique than I’ll ever achieve. Come near me again, and you’ll be needing an ambulance. But, hey, maybe NYU can provide one for you. Goodbye forever.

At 9 a.m. on Monday, Jan. 9, Carlo Y. Hensch ’24, a History of Art and Architecture concentrator, entered an unfamiliar kind of workshop. Though other Harvard studios often buzz with chatter, the students in this workshop were completely silent.
This was the beginning of an approximately two-week-long project to build a honryōsen, a type of Japanese flat-bottomed river skiff, in the basement of CGIS South. Douglas A. Brooks, a researcher and boatbuilder trained in the practice, led Hensch and 11 other students in their two-week workshop, a Wintersession program called “The Art and Craft of Japanese Boatbuilding with Douglas Brooks,” which was sponsored by the Edwin O. Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies. Students were tasked with constructing a boat using Japanese tools and methods while abiding by principles of traditional Japanese apprenticeships, which require silence, and diligent observation from apprentices.
“It became like working in your own little world for a little bit,” Hensch says.
Honryōsen was once a standard boat model for fishermen and farmers in the Shinano River delta. After World War II, however, honryōsen became obsolete: the region was drained and developed, and irrigation canals surrounding the delta were replaced by roads and highways. Before long, the skiffs — locally known as itaawase, which translates to “plank-built” — became a rarity.
Brooks is one of the few living people trained in this method of boat building. “I was the sole apprentice for seven of my nine teachers,” Brooks says. “There was just a missing generation of apprentices.”
Throughout his apprenticeships, Brooks’ masters emphasized the importance of nusumi-geiko, which translates to “stolen lessons” — a practice by which apprentices are required to steal techniques from their masters, rather than receiving direct instruction. Brooks recalls finding the requirements of traditional Japanese apprenticeships “shocking” at first.
“‘There will be no speaking whatsoever in the workshop,’” he remembers his teachers telling him. “‘You cannot talk to me. You cannot ask me anything.’”
During his two weeks at Harvard, Brooks conducted a similar, albeit slightly less intense, workshop with the cohort of 12 students, who. worked non-stop for four hours every day.
On a typical workday, Brooks would demonstrate different techniques and direct students’ efforts. Students would rotate their tasks, which varied from hammering planks together, to sharpening tools, to sweeping the floor, remaining quiet for the duration of the morning. At the end of the four hours, everyone came together for lunch, where they could rest and, finally, chat.
Getting used to the silence was “a little bit difficult at first,” says Sachiko J. Kirby ’26 . Kirby was initially drawn to the program because of her interest in Japanese history and culture, herself half-Japanese and Tokyo-born, as well as her enthusiasm for architecture.
She left the workshop with more than just practical carpentry knowledge. “You just had to trust your own instincts a little bit, which teaches you a lot,” she reflects.
For Hensch, the apprenticeship-style of the workshop felt freeing. “Within studio classes I do for HAA, I am bogged down by the fact that I am being critiqued by the result of all the work that I do,” Hensch says. “The only thing that is thought about is the end result.”
“‘You are the agent of the resolution you desire,’” Hensch remembers Brooks telling him.
Meanwhile, Brooks is unsure about if his Wintersession program was intense enough. He jokes that, if the students did not hate him by the end of the workshop, then he “failed them.” He firmly believes that apprenticeships should be adequately challenging because learning how to overcome obstacles is a key part of his pedagogy.
“In an early class, we came to this kind of impasse,” Brooks says. “I said ‘I refuse to save you.’ And for some reason that clicked. Everybody went, ‘Oh, I get it.’”
Similarly, Kirby describes a dichotomy between her experiences in school and this workshop. “Students ask questions to almost prove something,” she says of Western education. “Maybe it’s not even a question they really have, but they want it to be known that they’re thinking about a certain aspect of something, and then it starts to get competitive.”
“What I really enjoyed about this workshop is that the idea about not speaking is that whatever you’re trying to figure out, either wait and you'll see, or wait and you'll hear,” Kirby says.
“I’ll make a political statement: more tools, less books,” Brooks says.
One final step remains: according to Gavin H. Whitelaw, the Executive Director of the Reischauer Institute, the Harvard Women’s Rugby Team will carry the honryōsen out of its current home in CGIS South in April as the apprentices, waiting on the bank of the Charles river, watch the launch of the flat-bottom river skiff they built by hand.

On the eve of Thanksgiving, I crouched on the tiles of the Broadway-Lafayette subway station at home in New York, paging through prints by a street artist. His pen had swerved across the paper of each print into untraceable, chaotic lines that organized themselves into figures of afflicted creatures. And one of them — a contorted angel hovering in a vision of pink — bore the words that made it mine from the pile: “I forgive myself.”
The print reached my hands like a punctuation mark after a semester of practicing those words.
I was on the path of forgiving myself for maintaining relationships that had eroded my self-esteem. By then, I had written thousands of words across multiple pages in my notes app. I fluctuated between elaborately titled playlists and Ice Spice. I started walking to the Boston Public Library every day to clear my head. I had become someone who liked spontaneously writing lists.
Each of these habits revealed to me who I am. What’s more, they showed that forgiveness is contentment with every part of myself, especially those that I once wished did not exist.
At some point, I realized that I just took the usual advice — to write out my feelings, to listen to affirming music, to move my body — and struck the path of total honesty with myself every day. And, by the night I arrived at the station, I felt more present, unpredictably joyful, and intuitive than I had since my high school graduation.
And yet I bought the print anyway as a reminder to myself, because wherever forgiveness lies, I did not know whether I had arrived permanently. I was a visitor crossing a border with no checkpoint. How would I know how much I needed to forgive myself to actually feel forgiven?
I turned to my only constant source of advice on the subject: the legions of seemingly confident, grounded women who comprised my Instagram Reels algorithm (I deleted TikTok in a separate process of self-forgiveness, or rather, self-restraint, for the countless hours I spent on there). These women preach peace with our inability to change the past and announce a new era of womanhood, one in which I would stand alone and unwavering before the obstacles in my path.
To them, forgiveness is a metamorphosis, sometimes as much about an external transformation as an internal one. It would be too easy to characterize their process as egotistical, too simple to call these women’s goals vain. In truth, they understand that the body and mind are symbiotic. Their thoughts on self-forgiveness, kindness, and affirmation have unfolded and manifested into a radically changed relationship with themselves. Who wouldn’t want to share that with others?
The theory of self-forgiveness touted by these Instagram Reels women triggered my instincts for the most fundamental acts of self-care — I dressed up for class, bought concealer, and painted my nails. I spent time getting to know myself better, impulse by impulse.
But before the Instagram algorithm identified my problem with myself, my understanding came from the crusader against impulse: the Catholic Church.
In the Catholic Church, forgiveness is both God’s implicit promise to life and the edge on which we can either become redeemed or remain woefully flawed people. Although I am no longer very religious, as a spiritual, nature-as-life-force, organized-universe person molded by years in the Church, I worry that forgiveness may actually be the holiest act of all — precisely because I struggle most with it.
To my Sunday School self, the search for forgiveness was a form of poverty — forgiveness was the meekness, humility, and self-punishment you resort to when all that is worth living for has worn away. Is this worth applauding if achieved?
Clearly, Jesus, the Instagram Reels entrepreneurs, and I agree that it is, but my Sunday School self lacked an understanding of how to forgive beyond the rosary. Sometimes, I lashed out at myself, ignored my emotions, and — worst of all — persuaded myself I had forgiven others, because I never learned how to truly forgive myself.
As children, forgiveness, or at least the guise of forgiveness, is compulsory. When I hurt someone’s feelings or vice versa, teachers encouraged us to express and accept remorse immediately in order to restore normality. Cultivating accountability is important, but it can have the unintended result of teaching us to apologize reflexively and, therefore, insincerely. Perhaps I struggled to forgive myself of my flaws not because they were as consequential as I imagined, but because I had no blueprint to forgive. When Instagram provided a blueprint, I still wondered: How do you know when you have forgiven yourself?
I posed the question to a close friend. “You just know you have,” she said. “When you think about the situation, you don’t feel resentment toward yourself or anyone else anymore.”
Well, obviously. Yet I still paused, if not because of what she said, then because of the confidence with which she said it. Clearly, she had arrived at this conclusion many times, and I probably just hold grudges better than the next person. But, reflecting on her certainty, I realized that I had been trained to look for the wrong signs of my own forgiveness.
I will not realize that I have forgiven myself through an epiphany, and that epiphany will certainly not occur in front of a brilliant sunset or laughing with my friends around a dinner table. My life is not a movie; there is no fade to black, no denouement that reconciles each strand of internal conflict with forever. The feeling of triumph that emerges in those sentimental moments does not often withstand the inevitable mundanity to come.
For that reason, forgiveness has not proven a linear process, and I am not someone who can make it one. When I realize that I have forgiven myself, I will simultaneously realize that I had done so long before; it is and will continue to be a cyclical realization. For the first time last fall, I made kindness toward myself a conscious habit. I walked dozens of miles through Cambridge and Boston. I learned the lyrics of new albums by heart. I confessed to my notes app nearly every day. I decided what I would not share with my friends, and I became a better listener because of it.
Even still, I considered my kindness to myself a means to an end, and self-forgiveness a receding destination. I once felt ashamed that I had not yet emerged on the other side, without realizing the significance of my position in the middle. I had changed my habits precisely becauseI wanted a transformation. How I chose to forgive myself only determined who would emerge from it. This is who I am now — more pensive, intuitive, and kinder to myself than before.
On the night I returned to campus, I finally removed the print from my closet. Soon I will hang it above my bed, its angel a reminder that every day begins and ends with compassion.

UPDATED: February 13, 2023 at 4:17 p.m.
KitchenAid mixers are whirring to the beat of Taylor Swift’s “Wildest Dreams” while four students bustle about the kitchen, cracking eggs and kneading dough. They’re so focused that I almost feel bad for disturbing.
It’s a Thursday afternoon in the Lowell House Faculty Deans’ kitchen, and bakers are whisking, sifting, and pre-heating in anticipation of a beloved house tradition: Lowell Tea. A group of eight students spend these afternoons helping Faculty Deans David I. Laibson ’88 and Nina Zipser prepare for the event. Meanwhile, most Lowellians are still in class, pining for the puff pastries and black tea they’ll be served later that afternoon.
“It’s the best student job on campus,” says Connor Chung ’23 as he prepares an onion-olive ciabatta bread. “You get paid to spend several hours each Thursday just chilling.”
But “chilling” is a strong word for the busy afternoon ahead of him. After finishing the ciabatta, he’ll start up on a Sicilian flatbread. Later, he’ll be baking olive-tapenade danishes.
“You’re definitely running around a lot,” says Christy Zheng ’25 as she makes a batch of white chocolate chai snickerdoodles. “Our main focus is yielding a bunch of desserts, so it is pretty fast-paced. But I think you get used to it after a bit, and it’s a fun environment."
The team is spearheaded by Emma Kagan-Moore ’19, Lowell’s Residence Manager. Kagan-Moore has been involved with Lowell Tea since she started as a student baker in her sophomore year.
“There’s definitely been a lot of evolutions in the time that I’ve been involved,” she says.
Kagan-Moore first baked for the teatime tradition under former Lowell Faculty Deans Diana L. Eck and Dorothy A. Austin, who left the position in 2019. When Lowell underwent renovations, tea moved from the Deans’ residence to The Inn at Harvard. Then, while indoor gatherings were restricted during the pandemic, tea was served in the House’s courtyard. Now, tea has returned to its traditional locale: the Dean’s residence.
But for all the evolutions, Kagan-Moore believes that her work for tea is “really just greasing the wheels of a good machine,” she says. “I try not to do a lot of reimagining of tea as an event and just think about how we can run it most effectively as it is.”
The Lowell Tea tradition has had a long run since its inception in the 1940s under Elliott Perkins, Class of 1923, the second faculty dean of Lowell House, Eck says.
When Eck and Austin became Deans in 1998, they realized they would need help keeping the tradition alive. Although one of their predecessors, Mary Lee Bossert, used to bake for tea, neither Eck nor Austin — who both held full-time jobs at Harvard — had time. “It seemed right to have a team of student bakers,” Eck says.
Eck says the event reached another “turning point” in 2013 after the tradition was featured in Lowell’s Housing Day video, which soon went viral.
The video opens with Eck and Austin sitting in their foyer, holding porcelain tea cups. Delicate piano music plays in the background.
“We invite you to come to tea on Thursdays at five,” Austin says. “You’ll love it.”
Eck, who is holding up her teacup, suddenly drops it to the ground. “Whoops,” she says sarcastically as the video dramatically shifts tones and transitions to a parody of “Get Low” by Lil Jon & The East Side Boyz.
Over the next few weeks, an influx of students came to tea, following Austin’s advice. And they loved it. The video turned what was a small Lowell House affair into a college-wide event with attendance in the hundreds.
“It was a way of relating to students and being welcoming to students who may not have had anything like that in whatever house they lived in,” says Eck.
Before the event starts, most of the baked goods are out of the oven, lined up on ornate silver trays. A large pot of black tea brews on the stove, steaming like a cauldron. The bakers and servers move to scatter a few plates of baked goods around Laibson and Zipser’s home.
Students file into the residence, which comes alive with chatter. Once all the pastries are snatched up, a baker will carry out another tray to replace it.
It’s hard to miss the moment this happens. When Chung brings in his first plate of danishes, the students’ conversation halts, and everyone moves to swarm him. They follow him until he sets the tray down and pounce at the pastries.
Gabrielle R. Brown ’23, the server in charge of making the salsa and sour cream dish, says she relishes the swarming.
“Obviously I have to act mad and be like, ‘Oh my gosh, everyone. Excuse me, excuse me,’” she says. “But I love it. I used to be one of the swarmers. I think it’s fun and funny.”
Baked goods are brought out one tray at a time for a reason: bringing out the baked goods continuously “creates a little more momentum for sticking around,” Laibson believes.
Students like Julia E. Blank ’24 have grown to appreciate the event as a time to connect with other students, not just another desperate free food grab.
“Everyone in the House descends at some point,” says Blank, who also lives in Lowell. “It’s so good to see people you haven’t seen all week.”
But the pastries are also a draw.
“I don’t know anywhere else on campus where you can get quite the assortment of high-quality baked goods,” Lowell House resident Zachary M. Foltz ’24 says.
When I ask Foltz another question, he says: “I’m mid-bite, give me a second.”
“That pretty much describes it,” he says. “You’re always mid-bite.”
CORRECTION: February 13, 2023
A previous version of this story misspelled the name and misidentified the year of a server at Lowell Tea as Gabbrielle R. Brown ’24. The correct spelling of her name and her correct class year is Gabrielle R. Brown ’23.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Harvard Law School student was arrested after allegedly assaulting a fellow HLS student in a homophobic attack last month, according to a Harvard University Police report.
According to the report, HLS student Naod N. Nega approached another student outside Langdell Hall on the afternoon of Jan. 23 and repeatedly punched the student, calling him a homophobic slur.
Nega has been charged with assault and battery for the purpose of intimidation — a hate crime under Massachusetts state law. He pleaded not guilty to the charge at a Jan. 27 arraignment.
Nega’s attorney, Alice L. Purple, declined a request for comment.
According to the police report, a witness believed Nega to be either under the influence of narcotics or off medication and reported Nega was in possession of a baseball bat.
The police report also states that Nega, who is currently on a leave of absence from HLS, was previously involved in multiple incidents involving “aggressive and violent behavior.”
HLS spokesperson Jeff Neal declined to comment on Nega’s current status at the school, citing privacy laws.
Cambridge Police Department spokesperson Jeremy C. Warnick wrote in an email that CPD officers served a warrant for Nega’s arrest at a local hospital, where Nega was involuntarily transported after the initial assault.
A press release issued by CPD last week said a Cambridge male assaulted at least five staff members while at a local hospital. Warnick confirmed in an email that the press release referenced Nega.
“The male was initially sectioned to a local hospital on Monday, January 23rd after he was threatening students on campus with a baseball bat, used racial slurs, punched a college student in an unprovoked attack, and intimidated them due their sexual orientation,” the CPD press release reads.
At his arraignment, Nega was ordered to undergo treatment and evaluation at Bridgewater State Hospital and will return to court for a status hearing on Feb. 16.
The Middlesex District Attorney’s Office did not respond to requests for comment.
Monica E. Monroe, HLS assistant dean for community engagement, equity, and belonging, and Stephen L. Ball, HLS assistant dean and dean of students, wrote in an email sent to HLS students roughly nine hours after the attack that HUPD found no “immediate threat” to campus.
“We condemn unconditionally all violence, hatred, and homophobia, and will continue to work to foster a campus in which members of our Law School and University community feel welcome, safe, and included,” they wrote in the email.
The deans’ email referred to Nega as “an individual affiliated with HLS,” though some students said they were upset with what they viewed as a lack of specificity in the statement.
“We have the right to know that it was another student who was involved,” said Gabrielle L. Crofford, who serves as campus advocacy chair for Lambda, an LGBTQ+ affinity group at the Law School.
“Our perspective is that the more vague that they are, the more students are going to be stressed,” she added. “And not just queer students, because everyone’s wondering, ‘Are we safe on campus right now?’”
“No one should be harmed, harassed, or discriminated against because of their sexual orientation or gender identity,” wrote HLS Dean John F. Manning ’82 in a statement. “We will continue to work to support the rights and dignity of the LGBTQ+ community, and to ensure that everyone feels safe and welcome on our campus.”
Crofford said the assault is part of a larger pattern of homophobia on the Law School’s campus, citing violent threats emailed to LGBTQ+ Harvard affiliates in August 2022.
Three days after the assault, anti-abortion advocacy group Harvard Law Students for Life hosted Notre Dame law professor Sherif Girgis — a prominent opponent of same-sex marriage. Crofford said the event made her feel less safe in the context of the assault.
Harvard Law Students for Life and Girgis did not respond to requests for comment.
Neal declined to comment on criticisms of the Law School’s response to the assault or broader claims about homophobia on the school’s campus.
Lambda member Sean V. McDonough said HLS has provided a forum for prominent conservatives, a stance they said is at odds with the school’s aim “to be supportive of queer students.”
Crofford said the climate on campus contributed to the assault.
“Someone just got attacked — so we don’t need to ask questions of, ‘What does letting homophobic thought on campus lead to?’ This is what it leads to,” she said. “It leads to people getting punched and called slurs on our campus.”
The Law School hosted a meeting on Feb. 2 for students to discuss the assault with Monroe, Ball, and HLS Campus Safety.
Crofford called for institutional change at the Law School in the wake of the assault.
“We need to have a culture change because ultimately, the culture at HLS right now is not one that protects and values queer students,” Crofford said. “It’s one that protects and values concepts of academic freedom.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard administrator Armin Afsahi will be joining the University of Chicago, where he will serve as vice president for alumni relations and development, UChicago announced Tuesday.
Currently, Afsahi serves as associate vice president of alumni affairs and development for Harvard and dean of development for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Afsahi, who came to Harvard in 2019 from the University of Denver, has previously held similar roles at Georgetown University and the University of California San Diego.
In a Tuesday message to UChicago affiliates, UChicago President A. Paul Alivisatos wrote Afsahi has a “robust track record of inspiring fundraising teams to realize transformational gifts and ambitious campaigns.”
“With the aim of advancing the University’s mission, Armin will collaborate with colleagues to encourage the intellectual, social, professional, and philanthropic engagement of all members of the campus community,” Alivisatos wrote.
“I am confident that Armin’s leadership will help to ensure the University’s continued success,” he added.
In the UChicago press release, Afsahi said he looked forward to furthering “the distinctive role of UChicago in the national and global higher education ecosystem.”
During Afsahi’s tenure, the FAS saw higher-than-expected budget surpluses coming out of the Covid-19 pandemic, defying projections of substantial deficits. Current-use gifts to the FAS rose from $108 million in fiscal year 2020 to $130 million in 2021, before falling to $122 million in fiscal year 2022.
In an emailed statement, Afsahi wrote that serving under FAS Dean and University President-elect Claudine Gay was a “true honor and privilege.”
“Her values, principles and compassion have shaped an exhilarating development and global engagement agenda through which our team has been able to generate significant philanthropic resources,” Afsahi wrote.
In a joint email to FAS affiliates Tuesday, Gay and Vice President for Alumni Affairs and Development Brian K. Lee commended Afsahi for his tenure at Harvard.
“With a deep commitment to engagement and inclusion, Armin has thoughtfully expanded the FAS donor and volunteer community globally, connecting with people of all ages and from all walks of life,” they wrote.
In their message, Gay and Lee wrote they would “soon announce details to support this leadership transition, as well as plans to launch a national search for Armin’s successor.”
Afsahi’s departure comes as Harvard deals with turnover in several top administrative roles, including a new president and four new academic deans. The announcement was made the same day that Gay officially launched the search for her successor as FAS dean and a week after she launched the search for a dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
Afsahi will take up his post at UChicago on April 1.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard undergraduates lauded the growing traction of the Social Transition Fund — a collaboration between Harvard College Queer Students and Allies, the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, and the Harvard Undergraduate Association — as a financial resource to help students purchase gender-affirming care and products.
The program is intended for low-income transgender and gender non-conforming students who face financial barriers during the transition process. The application consists of a survey with questions about first-generation, low-income status, what the request is for, and the requested amount of financial support. Students use the fund to purchase gender-affirming care such as binders, packers, makeup, and clothing.
Brit G. Shrader ’24, an intern at the BGLTQ office, introduced plans for the Social Transition Fund at an HUA meeting last October.
“The Social Transition Fund was basically born out of a need of a student a couple of years ago who was struggling a lot with gender dysphoria, but couldn’t afford to get new clothes — both because of financial situations and their family,” said Shrader.
Benjy Wall-Feng ’25, a Crimson magazine editor and the other intern working on the Social Transition Fund at the BGLTQ office, said that the program aims to make the process of requesting funds as easy as possible.
“Historically, access to gender-affirming care has been locked from trans people,” they said.

Wall-Feng added that “levels and layers of bureaucracy” make it particularly different for people to secure necessary resources.
While dozens of students have requested support from the fund, its establishment has not been without controversy. Atlas Sanogo ’24, the co-president of the QSA, said the conservative campus publication the Salient has criticized the Social Transition Fund for its alleged preferential treatment of trans students.
“One point that repeatedly comes back to mind is just the fact that the trans student body as a whole generally is not as well-resourced as the majority,” Sanogo said.
They added that they hope the program can help alleviate some of the financial burdens of the transition process.
The Salient did not respond to a request for comment.
Receipts are required to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the fund and its future. The applications are reviewed every weekend and the funds are distributed.
Confidentiality is also an integral part of the program. Alana L. Young ’24, a Crimson arts editor and one of the co-presidents of the QSA, said payment methods like Venmo are used to accommodate those who may prefer to keep their transition private.
Shrader said the program is anonymous and no one has access to information regarding requests or funds other than the program’s top leadership.
“We respect students’ privacy so we don’t publicize who participates in the social transition fund,” said Travis Allen Johnson ’24, the co-president of the HUA.
During the 2021-22 academic year, more than $10,000 was requested and the fund was able to distribute a total of $6,000 to students, according to Johnson. Hana Rehman ’25, a Crimson blog co-chair and the HUA’s well-being officer said requests range from $20 to “as much as possible.”
This semester, around 100 students have applied to the fund so far, according to Shrader.
“I think with every program, it’s always a goal to increase awareness,” Johnson said, adding that he hopes the program can help students feel welcomed and comfortable in the Harvard community.
Some supporters and administrators of the fund said they hope to see expanded financial support for the resource in the months and years to come.
“The need that students have for this is far greater than what we can give to them,” Wall-Feng said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students, colleagues, and Harvard affiliates joined friends and family to celebrate the life and memory of former U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter at Memorial Church on Wednesday morning.
Carter served as the director of Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs for five years until he died from a heart attack on Oct. 24 at 68 years old. U.S. President Joe Biden called Carter a “force of nature” at a memorial service at Washington National Cathedral last month.
Dean of HKS Douglas W. Elmendorf gave the welcoming statement, describing Carter as a devoted and knowledgeable professor at the Kennedy School.
“He modeled public service,” Elmendorf said. “It was through public service, of course, that Ash became so well-known and admired beyond the Harvard campus.”
Graham T. Allison ’62 — Carter’s colleague and former dean of the Kennedy School — told stories about his time mentoring Carter, describing him as ambitious and “often awkward and anxious,” which received laughs from the crowd. Allison also mentioned that Carter’s background in physics gave him a unique perspective on politics, which added to his success in the field.
“The only bad thing I can say about Ash is that he was educated at Yale and Oxford,” Allison joked.
Meghan L. O’Sullivan, a professor of international affairs at HKS, said in her speech that she wanted to focus on Carter as a person instead of his career achievements.
“His biggest legacy will be his students,” she said.
Sullivan said that in preparation for her speech, she looked through students’ writings in memory of Carter, which highlighted Carter’s “warmth” and “encouragement.”
Eric B. Rosenbach, Carter’s close friend and co-director of the Belfer Center, teared up as he spoke about his relationship with Carter.
“We talked about almost everything,” Rosenbach said. “Ash and I spent so much time together in the Pentagon that people often confused us.”
Rosenbach recalled Carter’s compassion and his love of hugs.
“Once a very prominent four-star general asked me to ‘Please tell the secretary not to hug me in front of the troops,’” he said.
Aside from Carter’s students and colleagues, some Harvard affiliates who never met Carter attended the event.
Maya A. Bodnick ’26 said she heard of Carter through a class she took at the Kennedy School and chose to attend the memorial with some friends to honor his memory.
“He’s one of the most important military leaders in the last couple of decades,” Bosnick said. “So I’m here to celebrate the life of Ash Carter as someone who really cares about politics and national defense.”
To conclude the event, Rosenbach summarized the three lessons he believed students should learn from Carter.
“First, your perspiration matters more than your inspiration. Second, strategy execution often requires a force of nature. Third, you should always grab life by the reins,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 100 people signed a petition calling on Harvard Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf to resign after The Crimson reported he is forcing out online misinformation expert Joan M. Donovan from her role at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy and ending her research project.
The petition — which passed 100 signatures Wednesday afternoon — demands Elmendorf’s resignation, the continuation of Donovan’s Technology and Social Change project, and the hiring of Donovan as a full faculty member at HKS. It also requests the reversal of the Harvard policy that stipulates research projects must be led by tenured faculty members.
“Donovan is tirelessly dedicated to uncovering bad actors online, teaching her students how to do the same, and promoting social justice throughout her work,” the petition stated. “Defunding and stripping her of a position at HKS will only hurt the institution and prevent students from becoming effective beacons of truth, justice, and power.”
This petition is the second in the span of one month to call for Elmendorf’s resignation. More than one thousand Harvard affiliates signed a similar petition in January after he blocked former Human Rights Watch executive director Kenneth Roth from a fellowship at the school’s Carr Center for Human Rights. Amid backlash, Elmendorf reversed course and offered Roth the fellowship.
The Crimson reported last week that the Kennedy School is shutting down the Technology and Social Change project, which has been led by Donovan at the Shorenstein Center since 2019. The project is set to end by June 2024.
Devika Balachandran, who authored the petition calling for Donovan to be hired as a full faculty member, said she believes Donavan’s work combating misinformation is critical to protecting democracy. Balachandran, an HKS graduate who took a course taught by Donovan, said the scholar’s departure from the school will be a “huge loss.”
“​​Nobody else is doing this work at the Kennedy School,” she said.
HKS spokesperson James F. Smith wrote in a statement Wednesday that the Technology and Social Change project will remain active and has the funding to continue research over the next 16 months.
“This nearly two-year transition offers an unusually lengthy period to conclude the work,” Smith wrote. “If the TaSC project finds a home at another institution, HKS will assist in any such transition to help the work continue.”
The Kennedy School has also pledged to continue initiatives related to the study of misinformation and disinformation at the Shorenstein Center, including work on the Facebook archive project and the Misinformation Review, an online academic journal.
Kennedy School officials have pointed to the school’s faculty handbook’s guidance on principal investigators — which requires research projects to be led by a full-time faculty member — to justify the decision to end the Technology and Social Change project.
“The principal investigator must be centrally engaged in a project in ways that are reflected in the proposal budget as well as proposed activities,” the handbook states. “Only individuals with full-time Harvard faculty appointments or others explicitly designated by the Dean may serve as principal investigators.”
Donovan, who is not a tenure-track faculty member, currently serves as the Shorenstein Center’s research director and has taught as an adjunct lecturer in public policy at HKS.
“While there can be limited exceptions, those can’t continue indefinitely without a faculty member as the principal project leader and academic head,” Shorenstein Center Director Nancy R. Gibbs wrote in an email to the center’s faculty and staff last Thursday. “The decision to wind the TaSC project down is solely driven by that policy, which has been followed across the school for many years.”
Smith, the HKS spokesperson, wrote in a statement that “many projects are undertaken for a time and then sunsetted for various reasons — funding; relevance; leadership.”
“This is why we usually hire research project staff on time-limited appointments,” Smith wrote.
In an email to the Shorenstein Center’s advisory council on Friday, Gibbs wrote that Donovan was informed in summer 2022 that the project would need to shut down because it was not in compliance with the policy.
Donovan declined to comment on her status at HKS and the termination of her project.
Craig A. Newmark, the founder of Craigslist and a member of the Shorenstein Center Advisory Board, also called on HKS to hire Donovan as a faculty member. Newmark has donated $5 million to the Shorenstein Center to support the work of Donovan’s Technology and Social Change project.
“I know that Harvard has controls regarding a promotion, but the deal is that in major obvious cases like that, there is always room to do the right thing,” Newmark said. “I don’t understand why that doesn’t happen.”
“Joan’s work is vital for national security because there are people who wish us harm — and she is helping stop them,” Newmark added.

Thirteen Harvard affiliates will spearhead the University’s Legacy of Slavery memorial project, which is tasked with memorializing the enslaved people who played a formative role in shaping Harvard, the school announced Wednesday.
The committee is a product of the recommendations outlined in a landmark report released last April that revealed Harvard’s long-standing financial, intellectual, and social links to slavery, both past and present.
In addition to six other recommendations, the report advised that the University memorialize enslaved individuals through research and curricula.
“We must pursue not only truth, vital though that is, but also reconciliation,” the report reads. “Doing so requires a range of actions—visible and continuing—that address the harms of slavery and its legacies, many of which still reverberate today, affecting descendants of slavery in the community and indeed the nation.”
Led by co-chairs Tracy K. Smith ’94, professor of English and African and African American Studies, and Dan Byers, director of the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts, the committee will propose both a memorial location and design to University leadership.
“To honor the enslaved is to bear witness to tremendous grief and emotional freight and also to transmit immense awe for a people’s resilience and continuance even in the face of unthinkable odds,” Smith said in a statement to the Harvard Gazette.
Brenda D. Tindal, the newly-appointed chief campus curator of Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences, will also serve on the committee.
Though the University did not set a timeline for the committee’s final recommendations, the group plans to consult Harvard affiliates, descendants, and Cambridge and Boston residents through the process.
“We will seek community input to frame an expansive charge and selection process grounded in pedagogy and a belief in the ability of artists and community members to create a memorial space that exceeds the language and expectations we devise,” Byers said in a statement to the Harvard Gazette.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A renewed effort by the Harvard College Dean of Students Office to restrict the use of Harvard branding by student organizations could alter the branding of multiple student groups.
New organizations must include either “Harvard Undergraduate” or “Harvard College” and “Student(s)” in their name, according to a resource guide published by the Student Organization Center at Hilles. The rule only applies to clubs formed after 1998, when the restriction first took effect, according to DSO spokesperson Aaron M. Goldman. Organizations such as the Harvard Outing Club, which was established in 1939, are exempt from the rule, as are clubs that do not include the word “Harvard” in their names.
Several prominent student organizations appear to be in violation of the rule, including Harvard College Consulting Group, Harvard College Economics Review, and Harvard College Open Data Project. Others have modified their name in recent months to align with the regulations.
The guidelines, which dictate student-run clubs’ use of the Harvard name and branding, have been in effect since the late 1990s but are being enforced with renewed urgency, according to Associate Dean for Student Engagement Jason R. Meier.
“This request is not new, but there is more of an urgency,” Meier said in an interview last week. “It’s important and we really do need to resolve this issue.”
Lucy M. Ding ’24, co-president of Harvard College Open Data Project, said the organization is working to change its name to “some variation that is not in violation of the naming rule.”
Harvard College Consulting Group and Harvard College Economics Review did not respond to requests for comment.
Harvard Undergraduate Consulting on Business and the Environment, a student-run consulting group founded in 2008, referred to itself on its website as “Harvard Consulting on Business and the Environment” as recently as December, internet archives show.
The organization did not respond to a request for comment on whether or not the change was in response to the newly enforced rules.
Per the resource guide, the naming rules exist to distinguish student organizations from official representatives and actions of the College and University.
“Student organizations must make it clear, in all instances and contexts, that they and their related activities are student activities, and not activities of the College or the University as a whole,” the guide reads.
The guide also describes restrictions on how clubs can abbreviate their names, specifically that acronyms “may not be a hybrid of the Harvard name (spelled out) plus an acronym,” a rule seemingly violated by Harvard Undergraduate Women in Computer Science, whose website branding refers to the organization as “Harvard WiCS.”
“We are the Harvard Undergraduate Women in CS,” club co-president Karly Hou ’23 wrote in an emailed statement.
Harvard Undergraduate Film Club President Aidin R. Kamali ’25 wrote that the club’s name change this semester — a switch from the Harvard College Society for the Cinematic Arts — “might unfortunately turn away grad students.”
Still, some club leaders, including Kamali and Ding, said they are not fazed by the name changes.
“We plan on complying with the rule and don’t really believe that it greatly impacts our organization or our purpose on campus and beyond,” Ding wrote in an emailed statement.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Human Rights Watch Executive Director Kenneth Roth discussed the Harvard Kennedy School’s decision to veto, then subsequently offer, his fellowship at an Institute of Politics JFK Jr. Forum on Wednesday.
The forum came roughly a month after the Nation reported allegations that HKS Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf vetoed Roth’s fellowship to the Carr Center for Human Rights due to his public criticism of Israel. On Jan. 19, following controversy and calls for resignation, Elmendorf reversed course and offered Roth the fellowship.
While Roth said he was grateful to the IOP for hosting the forum, he spent much of the forum discussing the fellowship reversal, referring to it as the “gorilla in the room.”
“I have to recognize, though, that that happened only because I was in a privileged position and was able to create a media fury backed by many of you,” Roth said. “The issue of critics of Israel being penalized is a real issue at Harvard and around the world.”
Roth also called for “some level of transparency” from University President Lawrence S. Bacow and Elmendorf regarding an explanation for the initial veto.
“Who was it? Was it people who were concerned about donors? Was it somebody else? We don’t know,” Roth said. “I’d like to know what happened and I think it would be beneficial for all of us if we knew.”
Roth emphasized the importance of “affirming a commitment to academic freedom” for those on either side of the issue.
“I recognize that some students, particularly who have pro-Israel views, also feel peer pressure, particularly, not to speak out,” Roth said. “That’s a problem as well.”
HKS spokesperson James F. Smith did not comment on Roth’s remarks during the event.
Elmendorf regularly attends JFK Jr. Forums and delivered opening remarks at Monday’s forum, but he was noticeably absent from Roth’s on Wednesday.
Smith did not provide a reason for Elmendorf’s absence.
“The dean has conveyed his views about this issue to the Kennedy School community, and that message is posted online,” Smith wrote in a statement.
In an email to HKS affiliates last month, Elmendorf apologized for vetoing Roth’s fellowship, adding that he will request that a faculty committee “develop a faculty-driven process for evaluating Fellow appointments.”
“I now believe that I made an error in my decision not to appoint him as a Fellow at our Carr Center for Human Rights,” Elmendorf wrote on Thursday. “I am sorry that the decision inadvertently cast doubt on the mission of the School and our commitment to open debate in ways I had not intended and do not believe to be true.”
In a statement to The Crimson, Roth wrote that he met with Elmendorf on Monday morning to call for more transparency regarding the veto and “an affirmation of academic freedom,” specifically around discussing Israel and Palestine.
“He said he would consider my requests,” Roth wrote of Elmendorf.
During the event, Roth also spoke about human rights and his work leading Human Rights Watch.
Roth pointed to a Human Rights Watch report that criticized Israel, and he called Israel’s presence in Palestine “actually overwhelming” and “blatant apartheid.”
Roth said he believes the Israeli government “couldn’t find anything wrong” with the evidence or legal analysis in the report.
“They resorted to the usual name calling: ‘You’re biased. You’re anti-semitic,’” he said.
Roth said he believes there is currently “plenty of pro-Israel tilting” and called for a balance in perspectives in future speakers.
“What’s wrong with allowing a pro-Palestinian perspective today, and there can be a pro-Israeli perspective tomorrow?” Roth said. “We have to change this.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge City Council’s Housing Committee met Wednesday to discuss proposals to loosen height restrictions and increase floor space in affordable housing.
The proposals would amend Cambridge’s 100%-Affordable Housing Zoning Overlay — a law that aims to mitigate zoning and parking restrictions on affordable housing developers — to allow for the construction of 13-story affordable housing developments along some major Cambridge streets and 25-story developments in some Cambridge squares, including Harvard Square.
Wednesday’s meeting included City Councilors, representatives from the Cambridge Housing Authority, and members of the public. The proposed amendments expand the overlay’s dimensional requirements and could lead to the construction of more housing units.
City Councilor Marc C. McGovern began by stressing the urgency of Cambridge’s affordable housing crisis and how the city has taken little action to address it.
“We have a housing emergency. People agree to that, I think,” McGovern said. “And that’s not going to be solved by nibbling around the edges. The reality is that we get into debates about adding 19 feet of height to a building to create housing.”
McGovern said the city has thus far fallen short of affordable housing goals set out by Envision Cambridge, the city’s sustainable growth plan. Over 20,000 people are on the city’s affordable housing waiting list, 7,000 of whom live or work in Cambridge.
“We are nowhere close to being on track to reaching our Envision goals, which state that we need to build 12,500 housing units by 2030,” McGovern said.
Some residents opposed the zoning expansion. Marilee Meyer, a board member of the Harvard Square Neighborhood Association, said while she supported affordable housing in general, a 25-story tower in Harvard Square would be “inappropriate.”
“Location does matter,” Meyer said. “Infrastructure capacity is an issue and the AHO would require teardowns citywide, adding to greenhouse gasses.”
Some residents who spoke in support of the changes urged increases in housing density. Sara E. Barcan ’89, executive director of Homeowner’s Rehab Incorporated, said the plan would make it easier for developers to create large-scale affordable housing.
“The idea that we might be able to design our building as densely as possible and still provide some open space to residents and to the community is just extremely attractive, and I think will help all of us further those goals that we all share,” Barcan said.
McGovern also discussed the benefits of the amendments in housing zones across the city. He provided Cambridge Housing Authority projects 116 Norfolk, Jefferson Park Federal, and 52 New Street as examples.
“What CHA told us is that if they had more flexibility, particularly around height and density, they could’ve built a better project here, which would have been an additional unit, as well as additional open space,” McGovern said of the 116 Norfolk project.
The proposed changes, which would trim restrictions on building height, setback, and floor-to-area ratios for affordable housing developments, are the product of collaboration between the Cambridge Housing Authority and developers.
City Councilor Burhan Azeem described the scale of new AHO projects under the amendments.
“The six-story districts are going to nine stories, and the seven-story districts will now go to 13 stories,” he said.
About a dozen streets would also be affected by the amendments. Councilor Quinton Y. Zondervan said the committee focused on a “corridors and squares” approach — concentrating affordable housing initiatives on main corridors in each Cambridge neighborhood as well as squares that have been zoned for commercial development.
“The corridors and the squares were selected because those are where we have our transit hubs,” Zondervan said. “We can build affordable housing near MBTA stops, along bus routes, bike and pedestrian infrastructure that we’re putting in place there.”
Toward the end of the meeting, residents and advocates gave public comments, with each allotted 2 minutes.
Allan Sadun, co-chair of A Better Cambridge, told the committee “to take full advantage of every site.”
“It’s extremely cost ineffective to build small-scale affordable housing, but by allowing medium- to large-scale affordable housing on a number of priority sites and areas in every neighborhood, these amendments give affordable housing developers options,” Sadun said.
Resident Annmarie Flynn said she does not support the high-density construction that the amendments would promote.
“I don’t think that squishing everybody together is a good idea,” Flynn said. “If we are going to build housing, make it something that’s nice, make it desirable housing. Don’t make it just affordable and go with the cheapest possible way to pack in lots of people.”
McGovern said affordable housing planning should be focused on the people, rather than other concerns.
“We get so caught up in the numbers,” McGovern said. “All of this inertia when we really forget that housing is about people: who is going to get to stay in our community and who is not?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a rematch of the 2022 Beanpot Championship Final, the Harvard women's ice hockey (7-15-3, 6-10-3 ECAC) team traversed the Charles River to take on Boston College (17-12-1, 14-10-0 HEA) in the opening round of the 2023 Beanpot. Even with the two teams trending in opposite directions record-wise, both coaches recognized the heightened importance that comes with a Beanpot match.
"It's nice to beat them," said BC head coach Katie Crowley about the Crimson. "It's always going to be a tough one. It's always going to be a good, hard-fought battle no matter who you are playing against."
"It's a great rivalry," said Harvard head coach Katey Stone. "You want to respect them, and you want to be ready."
This time, it was the Eagles who came out on top in the rivalry. BC took the lead with an early goal by Cayla Barnes and never looked back. After closing out the first period with a one-goal lead, the Eagles piled it on in the second, as they shut out the Crimson and skated to a 3-0 win.
Harvard's first good look at the net came only two minutes into the game. The chance came as first-year forward Sophie Ensley was able to fire in a shot from close that BC goalie Abigail Levy saved. A little over a minute later, the Eagles got onto the board first, thanks to a brilliant pass from forward Caroline Goffredo to defender Cayla Barnes. Goffredo's cross-ice pass barely evaded the stick of junior forward Shannon Hollands before finding Barnes, who directed it into the top right corner. Despite the goal, the Crimson's offensive effort continued to put pressure on BC in the first. At the end of the frame, the Eagles only held a one-shot lead on Harvard. Some of the Crimson's best looks came late in the first after BC was assessed a two-minute minor for hooking. During the power play, senior forwards Anne Bloomer and Kristin Della Rovere sent shots on goal, but they were unable to beat Levy
Looking to erase the one-goal deficit, Harvard's first line came out firing on all cylinders to start the second. Sophomore forward Gabi Davidson Adams almost got the Crimson on the board three minutes into the second frame. After an intercepted pass kept the puck in the offensive zone, Bloomer threaded a pass between several defenders to Davidson Adams, who could not direct the pass on net and missed wide. A few minutes later, Bloomer got her own chance to light the lamp. Following a pass by Della Rovere, Bloomer fired a shot on goal that Levy, the reigning Bertagna Award winner as the best Beanpot goalie, bottled up.
The rest of the period, however, belonged to BC. Seconds after a shot from Kate Ham hit the pipe, the Eagles got its insurance goal. After sophomore goalie Alex Pellicci saved a shot, the Harvard defense was unable to fully clear the puck from its defensive zone. As the puck drifted toward the blue line, BC defender Keri Clougherty picked up the puck and laced a slapshot into the back of the goal to net her first career goal. A Harvard interference penalty later in the period gave the Eagles another chance to get on the board on the power play However, the Crimson were able to keep the puck out of its defensive zone and kill the penalty. Unfortunately for the Crimson, a second penalty later in the period would prove too much as BC notched its third goal in the final seconds of the second. Defender Sidney Fess scored when her long-range slap snipe bounced into the back right corner of the net as Pellicci could only get a piece of the puck.
The Crimson's second penalty was a point of contention for both coaches. After a long deliberation among the referees that included a video review, sophomore forward Ellie Bayard was assessed a five-minute major and a game misconduct for head contact.
"As soon as you're questioning it, you should probably take a look at it," said Crowley about the referee's decision to review the Bayard penalty. "I think they made the right call there."
"To me, it was a hard hockey play," Stone said.
Even though it was staring down a 3-0 deficit entering the third period, Harvard kept pushing throughout the full 60 minutes. The Crimson power play generated quality chances on both of its opportunities in the third frame. Harvard's best chance came off a faceoff win halfway through the period. Following the faceoff win by Della Rovere, senior captains Kyra Willoughby and Bloomer each launched shots that made Levy work to keep the shutout intact. As a testament to its continued effort, the Crimson pulled its goalie with three minutes left in the game.
“I'm really proud of how hard our kids played for 60 minutes," Stone said. "[Boston College] earned the win tonight, but I certainly think we gave them a heck of an effort."
No matter the outcome, the spectacle surrounding the Beanpot makes it a special moment for players.
"I grew up going to all the games," said Ensley about the impact of the Beanpot on her childhood. "A lot of my close friends who I grew up playing with are a part of the Boston team, so it is special to get to play with them."
The Beanpot is also noteworthy for those not native to the area, like Willoughby.
"Definitely top three," said the Minnesota native about where playing in the Beanpot ranks among her hockey experiences.
Before facing Boston University in the Beanpot Consolation game on Feb. 14, Harvard will look to earn crucial points in the ECAC standings during its matchup against  Clarkson (22-8-2, 11-6-1) on Feb. 10.

The Harvard track and field teams competed in two meets this past weekend: the Crimson Elite and Multi, hosted at Gordon Track, and the Scarlet and White Invitational across the river at Boston University. The team saw great success, with multiple school records broken, as well as standout performances that resulted in a national record.
At the Crimson Elite & Multi meet, several athletes surpassed school records and recorded personal bests. Sophomore Izzy Goudros won the pentathlon event with a score of 4173, enough to put her in third place in the NCAA rankings. Her long jump, set down at 6.20 m, even posted a new school record in the event. Sophomore Anastasia Retsa joined her teammate to set another school record in the women’s pole vault with her jump of 4.16 m.
On the throws side, senior Stephanie Ratcliffe won the weight throw event with a throw of 21.58 m, taking first place by just a single meter. Moving towards the track, first-year Mfoniso Andrew ran a 55.97-second 400 m dash to win the event. Her teammate, first-year Jackie Okereke took third place with a 56.83-second performance.
Senior John Minicus moved up to second on the Harvard leaderboard for the men’s heptathlon after he won the heptathlon shot put, throwing a 13.05 m and taking second in the high jump at 1.90 m.
While some Harvard runners were breaking records on their own turf, many of the Crimson smashed even more records at BU.
First, junior Maia Ramsden ran a 4:30.19 mile time, breaking the previous 43-year-old Harvard record which was set in 1980 by Darlene Beckford ‘83, a former Ivy League champion who never lost a single meet on Harvard’s track. The time was enough to put her second in the NCAA this season.
On the men’s side, the Harvard men’s distance team had three runners finish the mile in under four minutes.
Sophomore Graham Blanks followed the lead, taking second place in the mile and setting a new Harvard and Ivy League record in the mile at 3:56.63, putting him in the 13th spot for the NCAA. His teammates followed shortly behind, with first-year Vivien Henz running a 3:57.47 and junior Acer Iverson running a 3:58.27 to finish fourth and fifth respectively. For Henz, racing with one another gave him and the team a sense of camaraderie.
“I think that seeing all three of us, Acer, Graham, and I, break four minutes just felt good because you do it as teammates, you do it in the same race –  it’s comforting,” said Henz in reference to the mile race. “When you race your teammates like that, there’s a sense of familiarity. You’re not in the unknown, you’re not racing strangers, you know their racing etiquette.”
Henz’s mile time — the first time he ever ran it — was good enough to earn him the Luxembourg national record in the indoor mile, beating the previous record by over ten seconds.
“Coach told me not to think about the clock and just race the people in the heat, not the clock,” Henz reflected. His teammate, Blanks, had similar remarks about the strategy going into the race.
“That’s what our coach usually likes to tell us,” Blanks said. “In the indoor season, I think it’s easier to focus on the time because it feels like it’s all about time. He just wanted us to get in line with all the people and just relax, find the pacemaker, so that way once the pacemaker stepped off, we could focus in and then start trying to go from there.”
Harvard’s sprinters also had impressive performances on the track at Scarlet & White. Sophomore Victoria Bossong won the 500-meter run with a time of 1:10.23, setting yet another new record. This particular time is more than a second faster than her previous personal best, which she set just a week prior at the HYP meet.
In addition, sophomore Chloe Fair ran a 53.63-second 400 m second-place finish, which brought her to the third spot in the school record book.
The Harvard women’s 4x400 team left it all on the track, with Bossong, Goudros, senior Tina Martin, and Fair winning the event in the time of 3:36.79. On the men’s sprinting side, junior Peter Diebold and senior Max Serrano-Wu took third and fourth place in the men’s 500-meter run, with times of 1:03.02 seconds and 1:03.99 respectively.
“It’s not surprising. I was expecting that,” said Henz about the records falling. “We have a great bunch in the distance and middle distance group. Everyone knows what they’re in for, everyone trains hard, so it’s just collecting the rewards of the hard work we did over the fall season and winter break.”
Looking forward, the Crimson is keeping its eyes locked on the Ivy League Championships.
“We’d love to win the Ivy League Championship as a track team, which is something we haven’t done in a while, especially against the very competitive Princeton team,” Blanks said.
“I think it comes down to just wanting to see people on the team come up with personal records, stay healthy, and get ready for the outdoor season.”
Next up for Harvard is the Clemson Tiger Paw Invitational in South Carolina and Valentine Invitational at Clemson and Boston University on February 10 and 11.

As hard as it may be to believe, it is already February, and that means that it is the perfect time of year to express your love and admiration for those around you! The only thing is… since we’re at Harvard, we do things a little differently. Manifestations of the five love languages are present all around campus, and even if you don’t know it yet, you’ve definitely experienced them all.
PHYSICAL TOUCH — Touching knees on the 9:25 am shuttle to the SEC
Physical touch, out of all of the different love languages, is for sure the most bold. Come on, you’re literally IN CONTACT with someone — they’re going to know what's going on. Fret not! Harvard students have found a way around this issue through ~knee contact~. Hear me out. You’ve all been there in lecture, on the shuttle, or even in the dhall when someone else's knee just *happens* to brush against yours. And neither of you move. Yeah, that's what I’m talking about. Discreet but effective. Just a little reassurance that someone is there with you. Bonus points if you’re on the morning shuttle to the SEC, just because it's a little more spicy of an adventure.
WORDS OF AFFIRMATION — Gradescope CA Comments
We see some of you ramping up your workload with three (or even four!) pset classes this semester, and I have to tell you: I totally get it. Well, not in the sense of wanting to torture myself with that type of workload (even though I’m currently in three pset classes…), but for the extra sense of validation through Gradescope. CAs keep it real. They’ll tell you the good and be brutally honest about the bad. On my math midterm I got a comment that said, “This is not how fractions work,” and to be honest, I totally needed that. But when they tell you the good, it is so good. I feel so loved by the quirky little reassuring phrases left on a PDF during ungodly hours of the night. Seeing “ACADEMIC WEAPON” in the comments bar truly makes me feel warm inside.
QUALITY TIME — Sitting in the Math Question Center (MQC) until ungodly hours of the night 
Look, being in any sort of office hours that start after the dhalls close is definitely less than ideal, do not get me wrong. But the thing is, trauma bonding is unmatched. You know that you’re going to be in that room until you’re kicked out, only to have to relocate to one of the 24-hour libraries, where you’re going to end up in conversation about how late it is and how you all should have started working earlier, just to end up further behind on the questions that you originally were looking to get help with. Not the best situation, but one that makes you feel heard, that you are not alone in your nightly struggle of making the 8:30 a.m. deadline. Grinding in general has the same effect, whether it be in a library, someone’s dorm, or even one of those remote tables on the side of the third and fourth floor of the Science Center (a personal fav, especially the one by the meat freezer). Kinda cute, idk.
ACTS OF SERVICE — Saving a seat for someone in the crowded dhall or lecture hall (no seriously, why are they so crowded right now…)
Honestly, meals are an extremely vulnerable time. The same is true with the moments right before a packed lecture. You’re tired, you’re hungry, you’re cold, and your social battery is running low. The fact of the matter is, you’re not at your best. The last thing you want to do is to actively search for people that you know and see if there is an open seat near them (knowing that there probably isn’t and you’re going to have to figure out an entirely new plan). If someone saves you a seat, you know that they truly care about you. Honestly, just marry them on the spot.
GIFT GIVING – Sharing extra free merch from campus 
Let’s be real, everybody loves free stuff. There’s just something so wonderful about not having to pay for things (in a non-klepto way, obviously). Luckily for us on campus, there are many opportunities for free grabs, both in class and around campus. We see you with the “I Took CS50” shirts, the CEB sweatshirts, and now the “Let’s Talk LS1B Hats” (I actually don’t know if these are open to the general public yet, but I think I need one). Next time you come across free merch, grab extra for someone you care about. That’s true love — sharing the excitement of free goodies is an unmatched feeling. Extra points if the goodies are Harvard themed, because who would we be if we weren’t constantly advertising our school? Make that tuition do its work.
There you have it, the five love languages as they are represented across campus in their silly little ways. Next time you see someone grabbing an extra Insomnia Cookie from a club fair, or putting their jacket on the chair next to them rather than their own, you’ll be able to recognize what is really going on. Harvard does it better, even at love (don’t fact check me on this).

You asked — we answered. Okay no one really asked, except for my roommate and maybe me, asking myself. Do you find yourself sitting in the dhall for the entirety of the time it’s open for dinner so that you can authentically meet that one person you’re thinking of even right now? Perhaps it’s the person you really just want to call and blurt out that you’re in love with them…but that would be an issue considering you only met last week. Whatever the case may be, your roommates and the entire world want to talk to you without you glancing left and right to catch a glimpse of that special someone.
DON’T: wait for them to come join you in the dhall. 
Don’t pretend to do homework in the dhall from the second it opens until they walk in, only to then ask them to grab that meal with you. You have better things to do than sit there and think about them while everyone else is getting the new HUDS grill specials.
DO: travel all the way to the SEC — out of sight, out of mind this person. 
Unless they’re taking all of their classes in the SEC, it’s pretty safe to say that spending a day here means you have limited chances of running in with them. Avoid the Yard at all costs and any of the River houses. Maybe you’ll get the chance to think about something that isn’t them (like all the new Trader Joe’s snacks).
DON’T: stalk them on social media. 
If you want to stop thinking about them, it definitely isn’t the best idea to find their last 10 exes or their mom’s coworker’s aunt’s neighbor’s address. It also would not be the most advisable to find out their star sign and start calculating how compatible the two of you may or may not be.
DO: set up your Datamatch account. 
It may be time to meet new people. Whether friends or lovers, Datamatch can help you find the one for you — let the algorithm do its thing and find you the next person you may be reading advice for hanging out with for a super platonic walk around the Square.
DON’T: call them… or text them… and definitely not at 2 a.m. 
The best trick I ever learned was changing their contact number to your own phone number. That’s right, go ahead and call them. It won’t lead to anyone but you. No more texting that ex at 2 a.m. or the potential person that you could kinda see yourself dating down the hall.
DO: call your parents.
You know what’s a great thing to do? Call home. Call your parents or your siblings. Let them ask you how you’re doing and maybe, you can even let them nag you. If you’re completely showered by love (or complaints), you hopefully won’t have the mental capacity to think about your crush/the one that got away/the situationship you need answers to.
DON’T: watch that one clip of you two. 
Do not rewatch that one clip your friend took of you and them at that one party last week. They weren’t looking at you with puppy dog eyes, they were making sure you wouldn’t step on their new shoes as you tripped down the hall.
DO: watch a rom com. 
Consider watching He’s Just Not That Into You, Valentine’s Day, or When Harry Met Sally. Pop some popcorn, call your roomies down to the common room, huddle around that one 13” laptop screen and immerse yourself in the movie completely.
DON’T: apply to the research village just because they’re applying to it. 
The entire time you’re applying to PRIMO, SHARP, or [insert one of the many other research programs], you’ll be thinking about how nice it would be to grab a meal together by the river after a long day of doing…research? With that said, don’t apply to any of your internships based on the location you think they may be this summer. That will not get them out of your head.
DO: your pset. 
If you’re crying about Chem 27, you can’t be thinking about them. At least, you really shouldn’t be. Go to office hours, re-watch the lecture, and call someone who can help you understand arrow pushing (no, not cupid arrows). You don’t need them — you need to submit this pset by 8:59 a.m.
DO: get out of the situationship.
The way to get out of the situationship is painfully simple. Have a conversation with them, talk about what they’re looking for and what you’re thinking about. On second thought…yeah…maybe don’t do this one.
If you make sure to follow all of these Do’s and Don’ts, you’ll probably still be thinking about them surely get them out of your head. While it isn’t always easy to snap out of it, we promise there are better things to think about at 4 a.m. (and 4 p.m.) than what that person may be doing right now. For example, you could…you could…you could?
