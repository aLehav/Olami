Although it seems unlikely that “The Innocence of Muslims” will be nearly as impactful as Mohamed Bouazizi’s fateful self-immolation in 2010, the wave of violence across the Islamic world since its dissemination has thrown Western observers for a loop. In the wake of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens’ murder in Benghazi, a multi-tiered narrative has emerged in the American press, drawing together repudiations of the film, passionate defenses of free speech, and questions as to whether American policymakers have any control over events on the ground.
And while it’s clear that there is more than enough blame to go around, one emerging story of culpability might be most illustrative. In early press correspondences, a man identifying himself as Sam Bacile, an “Israeli Jew” living in California, claimed to have produced the film with the support of “100 Jewish donors.” Just as American Jews had begun to reconcile themselves to the unfortunate truth—despite lingering suspicions: since when is Bacile a Jewish name?—the Associated Press reported the Bacile identity to be nothing more than an alias for Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, a Christian Egyptian-American at the helm of the film’s production.
We cannot be sure what motivated Nakoula to pose as an Israeli Jew, but the damage wrought by his subterfuge cannot be undone. As the Wall Street Journal and Associated Press spread word that a Jewish cadre had financed a film mocking the Muslim prophet Mohammed, rioters accepted the news as further validation of a global Zionist conspiracy—a ubiquitous, hate-filled theme in the political discourse of the Middle East.
However, the takeaway from Nakoula’s false self-identification is a less tired one: to quote a friend’s paraphrase of a common Republican refrain, Nakoula and his fundamentalist Christian supporters “threw Israel [and Jews] under the bus,” assuming the reality of a fictive common interest in inciting Islamic fundamentalist riots. And although no measure of religious offense should entail a violent response, Nakoula’s selfish mistake makes a stark point about the problem of Christian fundamentalists claiming the mantle of America’s Israel policy.
Despite the appearances of the Christian Zionist movement, there exists a profound variance between the interests of the Christian right and those of American Jews on questions of religious plurality and Middle East policy. Unlike Nakoula, Pastor Terry Jones, and the throngs of conservatives up in arms about a creeping Islamic takeover of the United States, the Public Religion Research Institute suggests that American Jews are exceptionally tolerant of their Muslim neighbors.
Moreover, against the theory of an unquestioning Israel lobby, American Jews are more likely than the general American public to support pro-peace policies with regard to the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Working with thousands of responses, the Jewish Values Report recorded that American Jews were significantly more likely both to prefer diplomacy to military means and to support the enactment of a two-state solution than the average American.
These nuanced, pro-peace opinions come because of, rather than despite, the Jewish community’s deep concern for Israel’s security—a claim you might not believe if you let the Christian right and its Nakoulas speak for Jews. Earlier this year, biblically-motivated right-wing lawmakers in both Florida and South Carolina’s state legislatures passed resolutions calling for Israel’s annexation of the West Bank, citing the interests of the great powerbroker in the sky. During the Republican primary season, both Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich demonstrated their sincerest solidarity by delusionally suggesting that Palestinians don’t exist.
It is easy to make sweeping, millenarian statements about Islam and Middle East foreign policy when you don’t have any skin in the game: no matter how hot things get on the street in Benghazi, Cairo, or East Jerusalem, Terry Jones and the South Carolina Republican Party will be just fine. For many American Jews, the unmaking of Israel as a Jewish state or the cessation of its peace treaty with Egypt would be a personal tragedy—putting into harm’s way millions of brothers, sisters, and cousins. Moreover, as a community that can palpably remember the yoke of persecution, most American Jews have no interest in making the lives of American Muslims difficult.
Make no mistake: none of this is to minimize the immediate tragedy that claimed the lives of four distinguished American diplomats in Benghazi. In fact, as a secular person, I cannot begin to comprehend why any level of religious offense should compel anyone to violence—and above all, think it a healthy thing for people to make light of all systems of authority. But as a member of the Jewish community, I cannot forgive Nakoula for misrepresenting himself as an Israeli Jew and setting back the cause of coexistence in the Middle East yet another step. Let us hope for the sake of peace that the Christian right can learn from his lesson.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While Harvard’s Allston situation has been a perennially thorny issue, recent developments seem to suggest a brighter future for the ambitious project. With the economy (and correspondingly Harvard’s endowment) improving, what was once an indefinite postponement appears to have become a realizable future.  Although a welcome development for most, many residents remain deeply skeptical of aspects of the new master plan, particularly elements that have yet to be fully articulated by the university.
We commend the administration for addressing the major issues in its new master plan and defining a clear future for the property. The plan is not perfect, but the Allston community should be patient as Harvard tries to realize its goals as an academic institution while simultaneously balancing the needs and concerns of a large community.
We are, of course, aware of the damaging effect that Harvard’s involvement across the river has had in recent years. Much of Allston, Western Avenue in particular, has languished in the years following Harvard’s announcement that it would halt much of its long term plans to develop the area. An empty lot where a McDonald’s or Volkswagen dealership used to stand benefits no one. We understand and empathize with the Allston community’s desire for firmer commitments from the University to their goals.
However, now that Harvard has begun to move forward with a reimagined master plan and a demonstrable goal to develop the land meaningfully, the Allston community should bear with the administration as it proceeds. A project of this scale is by definition constantly evolving—countless factors from technological advancements to legal issues all but guarantee that the final result will differ from the original blueprint. It is also worth remembering that the Boston Redevelopment Authority must approve Harvard’s plans before the University can actually begin pouring concrete.
Ultimately, Harvard has no institutional obligation to prioritize the development of a community over the actualization of its private goals. However, it does have a social obligation to act as a constructive member of the community and do as little inadvertent harm as possible to Allstonians in the pursuit of its objectives. Going forward, Harvard should ensure that the Allston community does not further suffer further harm in this process. The administration should continue working with the Harvard-Allston Task force, giving members voting privileges when selecting developers, and keeping them abreast of major decisions.
The entire Harvard community wants to see Allston flourish, both for our campus and the surrounding community. The two goals have never been mutually exclusive, and we trust and hope the University will accomplish both.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On September 20, a jury convitcted 16 Amish residents of Ohio of hate crimes for cutting the hair and beards of a rival Amish community. The ironically named Samuel Mullet is accused of leading the attacks. Just your typical case of Amish hair-related gang violence.
Now convicted, the defendants may face life in prison. Why? Because the rival Amish community acted out of a religious disagreement, they are being prosecuted not for harassment but for committing hate crimes.
Hate crimes are an extremely serious legal offense. Specific legislation addressing hate crimes began in the mid 1990s, though its legal origins may be found in the Civil Rights Act of 1968. Generally, these laws require an increase in penalties if the crime was committed on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, ethnicity, or gender.
The legal status of hate crimes has long been a topic of serious debate. It is, understandably, a touchy subject. But it is an important subject as well and therefore one worthy of a healthy dose of skepticism.
The actions of the defendants in Ohio may have been barbarous (or barberous, for that matter), but do they constitute a hate crime? More importantly, do they warrant life in prison?
Discrimination of this sort is wrong. However, killing a human for despicable reasons yields the same result as killing for just mildly unappealing reasons. Somebody ends up dead.
The great irony behind the questionable legal status of hate crime is that critics can argue against the law itself as an unfair, discriminatory law. Why should crimes based on discrimination be considered worse than crimes based on jealousy or alcoholism? Why is it worse to murder out of homophobia or racism than out of sadism? This is not to say that I’d rather share a beer with a racist than with a sadist (given the choice, I’d probably stay home). I simply do not understand why our legal system should dictate which motive for murder is worse.
Hate crime law is relatively unprecedented because most other qualifications for motives work the other way by providing a degree of leniency instead of a harsher penalty. These are legal defenses designed to decrease culpability. Crimes of passion, for example, are considered in “heat of the moment” and often result in lighter punishments. The same applies to necessity, duress, and self-defense, all recognized as extenuating circumstances. A distinction such as “exceptional brutality” does, in fact, increase the penalty, but it does not qualify the motive and rather concerns additional crimes committed. The lack of similar precedent does not necessarily invalidate hate crime as a legal distinction, but it certainly warrants greater skepticism.
Other legal qualifications put the status of hate crime in tricky legal waters. The insanity defense exempts from full punishment those who cannot tell the difference between right and wrong. Therefore, those who support the distinct legal standing of hate crimes must be sure not to imply that racism is wrong. If racism were to be legally defined as “wrong,” then any defendant holding to his or her racist convictions clearly does not know the difference between right and wrong. The prosecution could never equate racism with insanity or a mental disability, though, of course, the comparison is tempting.
Most importantly, in my opinion, where do you draw the line? There surely must be some rather problematic situations where the basis of discrimination is ambiguous. I can just imagine the court proceeding: “Well, your honor, the defendant made a snide remark about dental hygiene before killing his British victim. Two life sentences!”
Even putting aside the difficult task of discerning what qualifies as a hate crime, the law does not clearly state to which crimes in particular the law applies. For example, murder, assault, and arson are all felonies and may qualify as potential hate crimes. However, can other felonies become hate crimes? Can someone sell drugs as a hate crime? Or what about lesser offenses; can there be jaywalking, loitering, mail fraud, or copyright infringement hate crimes?
Moreover, it is hard to distinguish whether what occurred in Ohio should count as a hate crime at all. After all, this was Mennonite-on-Mennonite crime. At any rate, almost all crimes are committed out of hate and I question whether this should really matter in the first place. Whether you murder out of deep-seated prejudice or because you lost a bet, murder is murder.

“Why are you leaving me? I can’t believe that this is our last week together,” my friend said softly, swinging back and forth, the metal chains clinking in the silence her words left. 
 
I didn’t respond. No words came to me.
 
I had grown up coming to Wellington Park, where we now sat watching the end of an era draw near. 
 
June-July 1997 
 
A sign bearing the words, “$1 with a cone top!” greeted neighbors as they made their way to the park on sunny summer afternoons. Selling lemonade is for schmucks; my older brother, aged 6, and I, aged 4, opened up a snow cone stand instead. We didn’t have a piggy bank—we had a metal deposit box. We were serious.
 
Sept. 1999 - June 2004
 
In elementary school, we never went home directly after school; getting off the bus and going to the park was a daily ritual. While I was having a great time on the tire swing, my stomach suffered. It tendered its resignation one day after being tossed around one too many times. I threw up in the bushes. It was the most embarrassing thing that my pre-double-digit self had experienced, and I avoided tire swings for the rest of my childhood.
 
Other memories: catching baby turtles, which urinated on our hands; fishing in the pond for Godzilla, a colossal albino turtle; sneaking into the bordering horse farm; building secret hideouts in the trees.
 
Sept. 2007 - June 2011
 
Even in high school we couldn’t avoid Wellington Park. Suburban life doesn’t provide many satisfying diversions. We would lie on the basketball court and eat brownie sundaes from the ice cream place down the road and feel the pavement sizzle against our bare legs. We would play flag football and Frisbee on the grass, and I would, of course, be the worst one on the team. 
 
Sometimes, we watched high school kids smoke pot surreptitiously—or at least try to—and we laughed as they joined us on the swings. Those were strange conversations. But mostly, we would swing aimlessly as we aimlessly talked about life.
 
August 2011 
 
“I’ll be home in December. Four months isn’t that long,” I finally responded. She rolled her eyes. 
 
Times change. When the old wooden fort was replaced with a new plastic playhouse, I might have felt sad. I didn’t, though. As I’ve learned, one day, you return from whence you came and it’s just different; that’s how things are. 
 
And yet, we still go back to Wellington, where we leave a broken silence, our broken silence, atop the swings, our swings.

In light of the recent Hasty Pudding merger, FM proposes a few future pairings.
1) The Piano Society and The College Events Board
Students gave up on Yardfest long ago. We might as well turn it into a piano recital and use the money for hot breakfast.
2) The Harvard College Wine Society and PBHA’s Youth Recreation Program
Funding safe, fun after-school activities for all ages.
3) FOP and The North Korean Human Rights Society
That’s what they meant by a level 3 “switch trip.”
4) Scholars at Risk and Harvard Varsity Club
5) CityStep and The Crimson Key Society
Red, peppy dancing tours of Harvard. In other words, Key will stay the same.
6) Harvard Alumni Association and Gap Year Harvard College
 Matching students with their parents.
 
7) First Year Social Committee and the Hasty Pudding Club
There aren’t many places left to be social on campus.

It happens every September; the influx of both freshmen and recruiters means that it’s time for email signatures to swell to a thing of gargantuan proportions and grotesque beauty. While there are essentials to convey—you do want your boo to know your phone number, after all—there is more fat to be trimmed from the foot of a Harvard student’s email than a whole season of “The Biggest Loser.”
Let’s start with the sign-off. If your sign-off says anything in the same kitschy font as your signature, chances are you won’t be seen as “truly yours,” “sincere,” or having any sort of love whatsoever. To those of you still attached to Comic Sans or Monotype Corsiva? Shut it down.
Next comes the meat and bones: the dropping of the H-bomb. It doesn’t matter if you say “Harvard College” or “Harvard University”- you’ve broken the dam to free-flowing douchebaggery. While we surf that wave, for every link that follows to LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, or any other website, do not pass go, do not collect 200 dollars. And never, ever, should any sort of image be there. It only serves to trick people into thinking you’ve sent them some sort of exciting attachment when you’ve actually only sent a photo that, more often than not, will fail to load.
The inspirational quote? Yes, Gandhi is amazing. Yes, there is some providence in the fall of a sparrow. And yes, it is, in fact, tomorrow in Australia. My point? Needs to go. Security?
And to those of you whose messages end with “Sent from my iPhone”? We. Can’t. Even.

Rachel A. Brown ’10 recently released her first EP, “Building Castles.” Brown was named one of Fifteen Minutes’s “15 Most Interesting Seniors” in 2010, when her mellifluous voice and newfound guitar skills were just beginning to take shape and gain attention. Her talents have since been recognized by the likes of Wyclef Jean and Perez Hilton; she has produced multiple singles, a handful of YouTube covers, and a soon -to-be-released music video. With Brown busy on her tour, Fifteen Minutes caught up with her over the phone to talk about her EP, music video, and fond memories of Harvard life.
1. Fifteen Minutes: You just released your new EP, what has been your favorite part of the project so far?
Rachel Brown: Wow, it’s been such a long process. We started well over a year ago. But I think my favorite part was sitting down and kind of talking through the songs of the people I work with, sort of coming up with all the sorts of layers and textures we wanted to add to fully realize the songs. So through the brainstorming, getting excited about a portion, and then flashing forward to the end once everything started coming together. I mean the last thing you do is the vocals. You work on everything, piece by piece, and it can kind of get a little abstract at times, but once it all becomes a real song then I get real excited about it.
2. FM: Your sound is so effortless, and it often syncopates against the rhythm, running with a melody distinct from that of your guitar or ukulele. The outcome is wonderfully unique—nestled somewhere among the unlikely crosshairs of Lauryn Hill and James Taylor. Where did this sound come from? Were you mimicking other musicians or was this something you came up with all on your own?
RB: I don’t know, I just sort of started singing and that’s what came out. I’m sure, I guess if you did a study on my brain you might be able to track back all the different influences I’ve had. I’ve sort of always been drawn to interesting voices, probably in part because mine was a little different. And also because I was attracted to things that are a little bit off. But I don’t know. I started off singing quietly in my bedroom. I listen to my old tapes that I’d recorded, and I sound the same—maybe a little more confident.
3. FM: At Harvard you concentrated in VES and studied filmmaking. You also recently finished shooting a music video for your song “Bumblebee.” Did you help to produce the video at all, beyond your performance in it?
RB: I actually stepped out of this one. I had this really amazing director, Ian Wolfson. I loved his stuff. He knew what I wanted to do. So I felt totally comfortable letting somebody else handle it. I studied documentary anyway at Harvard and it’s totally different than what we did. I don’t think I’d have the patience for all that storytelling and what not.
4. FM: Do you think anything you did at Harvard really prepared you for a career in music?
RB: I think so. You work hard there and you learn how to manage yourself and be constantly working and trying to get ahead. I think that really prepared me. I don’t know what comes first: the drive to do [things] that brings you there and then you go along with it sort of nurturing you.
5. FM: Would you ever consider coming back to Harvard and staging a live show for your alma mater?
RB: Of course, I’d love to do that. Yeah, its funny I’ve been doing this college tour. I’m doing one tonight. And I’ve played at, I don’t know, this is probably my fiftieth college show and none of them have been Harvard. But I think that would be really fun.

By forging his SAT scores, plagiarizing essays, and crafting phony transcripts from Andover and MIT, Adam B. Wheeler faked his way into Harvard. Once he got to the College, he didn’t stop his cons—he snagged more than $45,000 in prizes and scholarships before he made one gamble too many. His application for the Rhodes and Fulbright Scholarships finally brought him down. Crimson executive Xi Yu ’13 and Managing Editor Julie M. Zauzmer ’13 covered the story of Wheeler’s academic fraud for The Crimson from the moment news of the case broke, when they were freshmen in 2010. Their reporting led to a book, “Conning Harvard,” published this week by Lyons Press and excerpted below.
Picking up Adam Wheeler’s Fulbright application essay, Harvard professor James Simpson read, "It is a truth universally acknowledged that we live in an intensely mobile society." A truth universally acknowledged…borrowed from Jane Austen. Common English major fare, the clever or not-so-clever reworking of beloved words until they almost become everyone’s and no one’s. He read on.
As he proceeded, he was surprised to find that the essay still felt familiar. It was, as the opening line implied, about mobility. The writer quickly connected the frenetic pace of global movement to life at his own college, stating that "the simple phenomenon of an undergraduate education at an institution such as mine assumes and indeed requires mobility." In the next paragraph, he gently criticized academia for assuming that the blending that takes place between civilizations represents outlying cases rather than the core of all cultural development.
"It’s funny the way an idea comes of age," Simpson mused as he read, "the way an idea all of a sudden is being expressed by different people in independent moments." This essay sounded just like something his colleague Stephen Greenblatt had written. After a few sentences more, he was overcome by the nagging feeling that he had already read these thoughts. He put Wheeler’s essay down and walked across his office to a ceiling-high bookshelf. He spotted the volume he was looking for and pulled it from the shelf: Essays on General Education in Harvard College.
The crimson-covered paperback had been printed four years earlier when the college was considering revamping its decades-old Core Curriculum. The byzantine set of requirements mandated that every undergraduate pass one class in each of seven out of 11 groups with names like "Social Analysis," "Foreign Cultures," and "Literature and Arts A, B, and C." To make matters more confusing, the four categories from which students were exempted were not up to them; they were determined based on a student’s concentration. Figuring out which course groups one did or did not need to pass in order to graduate meant opening a 28-page booklet and following a long chain of fine-print asterisks and plus signs.
Back in 2002, the college had started talking about overhauling this system. At a place like Harvard, though, even a move to simplify things gets complicated. When the Core Curriculum itself was instituted back in 1978, the then-new framework of required classes was called "radical" by The New York Times and was hotly debated on campus and even nationwide. Derek Bok, who was president of Harvard at the time, wryly told The Washington Post that "changing undergraduate education is like trying to move a graveyard."
But change they did, under Bok, and in the early years of the new millennium, the powers that be decided that it was time to dig up those bones all over again. In order to start that change in the most Harvardian way possible, it was decided that they should write a book mulling over the idea.
Notable professors were solicited to write down their thoughts about what the new required course groups—termed General Education rather than the Core—should look like. Those essays made up the book that Simpson now held in his hands.
It was a book Wheeler was more familiar with than most people. He had been stealing pieces from it even before he came to Harvard. It was the collection from which he had amalgamated five different professors' words for his Harvard application essay. He had used other pieces from it for his Rockefeller grant application. Greenblatt’s was clearly his favorite. It was the only essay that he had used in both of those applications, and for the Fulbright and Rhodes, he had not even mixed it with other pieces from the same book. In the past, he had drawn from pieces that said that a Harvard education should include more environmental studies, that it should emphasize creativity and communication skills, and that it should teach students about capitalism and terrorism. Greenblatt said in his entry that he wanted an undergraduate curriculum that focused on cultural mobility.
Simpson flipped through that book until he reached Greenblatt’s piece. There he read, "It is a truth universally acknowledged…." He sat down, placing the student’s essay and the professor’s side by side. They were almost identical. Once in a while, the copy in the bound booklet used the pronoun "one" and the copy Simpson was holding next to it said "I." Simpson was convinced that he was looking at the most blatant plagiarism he had ever seen.
Three minutes later, he called Adonica Lui, the chair of both the Fulbright and the Rhodes nominating committees at Harvard. Lui was in a meeting, Simpson was told.
"I think you should go get Adonica," Simpson said firmly. It took a moment of convincing. Finally, he was put on hold.
In University Hall, just a short walk from Simpson’s office, Lui was sitting at the final meeting of the Rhodes and Marshall judging committee. At the close of the session, the group assembled around that table would distribute a list of students who had received Harvard’s endorsement for each scholarship.
The process was winding down. They had a tentative list of candidates to endorse that they were getting ready to finalize. Then someone knocked on the door. "Call for you," the staffer said to Lui.
Lui spoke to Simpson for a moment. She had to come over to his office right now, he insisted. It was urgent, more urgent than wrapping up the Rhodes and Marshall deliberations.
Minutes after she picked up Wheeler’s writing sample and the Gen Ed book herself, Lui was persuaded that they had a plagiarist on their hands. "It was lucky you called me," she said, turning to Simpson." Wheeler had just been put on the short list for the Rhodes Scholarship."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first time in Harvard history, the men’s and women’s golf teams will share a head coach, the golf program announced last Friday.
Kevin Rhoads, who has coached the women’s team to multiple league championships, will now serve as head coach of both teams. Claire H. Sheldon ’10 and Daniel Joseph were named assistant coaches for the women’s and men’s teams, respectively.
“Certainly our confidence in Coach Rhoads and the great job he’s done for the women’s team over the past eight to nine years, in building [the women’s] program into the best program in the Northeast has a lot to do with [the change],” said Director of Golf Fred Schernecker ’89.
Coming off its third Ivy League Championship in five years, the Harvard women’s golf team has achieved success both in tournament play and in its efforts to recruit young talent.
This fall Christine P. Lin ’16 was been named one of Golf World’s Top 50 Players to Watch. Last year Tiffany Lim ’15 was ranked the nation’s sixth-best freshman by Golfweek Magazine.
Schernecker said that financial considerations were not a factor in the department’s decision to consolidate the program. “We’ve tried to operate the new structure within the same budget that we had before,” he said. “I think the primary goal was to get our men’s team the best possible coach we could find and we already had the best coach we could find on the women’s team.”
Under Rhoads, the women’s team has tallied  its six best scores in team history and won 29 tournaments. Last season, Bonnie Y. Hu ’14 won the individual title at the Ivy League Championships, Lim was named to the All-Ivy second team and won Ivy League Rookie of the year, and Jane Lee ’12 was named to the All-Ivy second team.
The Harvard women’s team won its first Ivy League Championship in the 2007-08 season, when new assistant coach Sheldon won all-Ivy recognition. Rhoads and the team continued their winning streak with a consecutive Ivy title in the following season.
Though Rhoads’s official appointment to the men’s team was only announced recently, he has been working with the team for a number of weeks in anticipation of the switch.
“He’s been great in balancing the job with the two teams, and he’s working really hard to give both teams the attention they need,” junior captain Theo D. Lederhausen ’14 said. “He’s all about positivity, and he definitely preaches that by reaffirming what’s good about our [play].
”Under former men’s coach Jim Burke, Harvard placed fourth at last year’s Ivy League Championships. The team’s best showing was at The Century Intercollegiate, where it came in second. Harvard is entering this season with three of last year’s starters—Lederhausen, Seiji Y. Liu ’14, and Akash D. Mirchandani ’15.
“The men’s team has been on an upward swing the last couple of years, and my main ideas are to try to build on some of the successes that they have been having, with the eventual goal of trying to get them to the same level as the women have been, relative to the rest of the league,” Rhoads said.
The dual-coaching appointment is unusual—and perhaps unprecedented—in the Ivy League.
“Kevin is a fantastic instructor,” Princeton’s women’s head golf coach Nicki Cutler said. “He’s really a student of the game, and I think he has a lot to bring to the table, in terms of teaching and coaching.”
Both Rhoads and Schernecker believe the new structure of the golf program is a way to extend Rhoads’s coaching through the network of assistant coaches.
Sheldon was the captain of the women’s team in 2010 and helped the team to win two of its last three league titles. On the men’s side, Joseph, who hails from Pennsylvania State University, will look forward to his first season with the Crimson.
“This is an ideal situation for us and for coach Rhoads,” Schernecker said. “It might look like a trial, but it’s something that we’re committed to and see as the right thing for our teams.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the fall job recruiting rush kicks into gear, Harvard seniors are beginning to stress—not just about the fonts on the resumes but also about whether their belts match their shoes.
In the middle of their job hunts, seniors are beginning to exchange their black sweatpants for black suits. And while some are fiddling between full and half Windsor knots for their power ties, others are rummaging through their jewelry boxes for the perfect necklace-earring combination. But these students say that their fashion choices aren’t inspired by Oscar de la Renta or Donatella. Instead, the Office of Career Services serves as their aesthetic guide.
“OCS sent us a ‘suit up’ email,” Bo Kyeong “Jennifer” Kwon ’13 said, describing the office’s email that gave pointers on how to dress for consulting interviews.
“We’re supposed to wear suits of darker colors,” said Chyi-Shin Shu ’13.
And most students do. “I go conservative,” Riju Agrawal ’13 said. “Black jacket, black shoes, white shirt.”
Belinda Pang ’13 strives for what she said is a “standard” look. Wearing a dark navy suit, a white blouse, and a pair of beige heels, Pang said her wardrobe was inspired by a professional aesthetic—what she said she would be expected to wear to the office.
But that’s not to say that all job candidates looked as if they came out of George Orwell’s ‘1984.’ Agrawal said he adds his own pizzazz by wearing a tie that is blue, his favorite color.
Kwon said that she chose a black suit, but that the material was accented with silver sparkles, adding a pop of personal flair to her outfit.Kwon added that students aren’t meant to throw on identical outfits for interviews for firms in Silicon Valley and interviews for McKinsey.
“You need to dress well, but you don’t necessarily have to wear a tie or jacket,” Kwon said. “Put on a nice shirt, but maybe undo a button or two.”
And for those looking at fashion jobs, all rules are rewritten. “If you want to be a fashion designer,” Kwon said, “you should add a little spice to your wardrobe.”

The line between online and face-to-face bullying has become increasingly blurred, researchers at Harvard’s Berkman Center for Internet and Society said Wednesday.
Continuing its collaboration with Lady Gaga’s Born This Way Foundation that was founded last February, the Law School center released a review of current scholarly literature on bullying. The paper defines and looks for solutions to online and in-person abuse synthesizing current research on the topic.
“Bullying is a multi-faceted phenomenon full of nuances,” Executive Director of the Berkman Center and co-writer of the review Urs Gasser wrote in an email. Gasser could not be reached by phone at his office.
Although research and public conversation often draw distinctions between bullying that occurs in person and in cyberspace, children are frequently involved in both spaces, according to the paper. It concludes that there is not a universally accepted definition for the two types of bullying.
Gasser said the paper will be central in clarifying other gray areas, such as challenging the traditional roles of the bully and the victim. The paper also will educate the general public on the current scholarship on bullying.
“The primary goal of the paper is to ‘translate’ important scholarly work and make it accessible to a broader concerned audience,” Gasser wrote.
The paper, titled “Bullying in a Networked Era,” is part of the Berkman Center’s Kinder and Braver World Project, an ongoing research project on the topic of youth bullying that it launched shortly after Lady Gaga’s visit to Harvard. During her visit, the pop star launched the Born This Way Foundation in Sanders Theater to a star-studded crowd, which included Oprah and Deepak Chopra. Its mission is to serve as a platform for conversations and research on bullying, and empower youth through grassroots and social media efforts.
The Berkman Center plans to continue its partnership with Lady Gaga’s foundation  and other  organizations, including the Graduate School of Education, to further investigate the topic of bullying. The center will release additional papers in the coming months as part of the Kinder and Braver World series.

Dean of the Division of Continuing Education Michael Shinagel will be stepping down after almost 40 years of leadership, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith announced in an email to faculty members this afternoon.
Since becoming dean in 1975, Shinagel founded the Harvard Institute for Learning in Retirement and oversaw the approval of masters’ degree programs at the Extension School.
“I can appreciate how a new leader at DCE will take us through the next 20 years, but I need not tell you how bittersweet I feel about leaving the deanship after all these years,” Shinagel wrote in an email statement to The Crimson. Shinagel could not be reached at his office by phone as of yesterday afternoon.
According to Smith’s email, Shinagel will step down as soon as administrators conclude a nationwide search for the next dean, who will take the helm of an array of operations in FAS—including the Harvard Extension School, the Harvard Summer School, and the Harvard DCE Program for Professional Development.
Despite arriving at Harvard more than a half-century ago—he taught his first freshman English section in the fall of 1958 before receiving a Ph.D. in English from the University and teaching at Cornell University and Union College in Schenectady, NY for 11 years. Shinagel still possesses an unwavering commitment to the institution, and dean is only one of his long list of roles here.
Shinagel served as master of Quincy House from 1986 to 2001, president of the Faculty Club, and a member of the Faculty Council, the FAS governing body. He plans to remain a senior lecturer in the English department, where he has taught since 1983.
“He was completely devoted to Quincy House,” said Lee Gehrke, who serves as co-master of the House today. “He’s probably the most loyal member of the Senior Common Room.”
Gehrke fondly cited Shinagel’s dry humor and love of scotch and cigars, adding that one of the dean’s best qualities is his deep understanding of Harvard’s history.
In fact, Shinagel won the Philip E. Frandson Award for the best book on continuing higher education for ‘The Gates Unbarred: A History of University Extension at Harvard, 1910–2009’ in 2010. The book details former University President A. Lawrence Lowell’s efforts to expand the reach of education through initiatives such as the Harvard Extension School and online courses.
According to Smith, an event will be held in the coming spring to honor Shinagel’s contributions to the Harvard community.
For now, Shinagel drew from the ancient Chinese philosopher Confucius to describe his tenure as dean.
“‘If you find work that you really enjoy, you won’t have to work a day in your life!’” Shinagel quoted from the famous thinker. “My 38 years at DCE have confirmed this truism every day.”

This article has been revised to reflect the following corrections:
CLARIFICATION: Sept. 21
An earlier version of this article stated that Lee Gehrke succeeded Michael Shinagel as master of Quincy House. While Gehrke, a current House master, did follow Shinagel in the role, Shinagel was not Gehrke’s immediate predecessor.
CORRECTION: Sept. 21
Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this article incorrectly spelled the name of the outgoing dean of the Division of Continuing Education in its headline. He is Michael Shinagel, not Michael Shinagle.

After over  three decades of Wednesday teas at Sparks House, the staff of Memorial Church has decided to discontinue the tradition, carried on by the late Reverend Peter J. Gomes until his death in 2011.
The staff of the Church have decided to launch a new tradition of gatherings at the recently opened MemChurch Café. After morning prayers on Wednesday, members of the community can gather at the Café for coffee and pastries.
“It will have the same ethos and hospitality [as the Wednesday teas],” said Memorial Church Epps Fellow Nathaniel P. Katz.“It will be a social space for the community, where people can cross-pollinate, socially, intellectually, morally, and ethically.”
According to Katz, the Church has placed a renewed emphasis on fostering community across the Harvard campus, in line with President Drew G. Faust’s efforts to unite Harvard’s schools into “One University.”
“We’re really looking to open up our doors—literally—in a space that is right at the crossroads of life on campus,” Katz said.
Michael P. Stanley ’13, a regular tea attendee who occasionally played piano at the gatherings, said that although he was disappointed when he first heard that Wednesday teas at Sparks House would be discontinued, he has come see it as a change rather than an end.
“The tradition that I saw and I felt was a tradition of refreshment and retreat from what is otherwise a hectic world and that tradition is being maintained through this new attempt,” Stanley said.
On days with good weather, the gathering will take place outside. On days when the weather is poor, it will be held in the Church’s Memorial room.
This fall the Church also welcomed its new Pusey Minister, Reverend Jonathan L. Walton, who was chosen last spring to follow in Gomes’s footsteps.
When Rev. Walton and his family are more settled in Sparks House, they plan to open it up to the Harvard community and host various events, according to Katz.
Gomes first began to host Wednesday teas in 1974.
“Rev. Gomes greeted every person that walked in,” said Stanley. “When you left there, you were a better person than when you walked in—you felt a little lighter.”
Justin Mathew ’14 started going to Wednesday tea regularly in his sophomore year after seeing it publicized in Memorial Church announcements.
“It was really this unique opportunity to interact with all the faculty, as well as other people who are involved with the church,” Mathew said. “You got this very diverse group of people with sundry personalities.”
After Gomes’s death, Katz restarted the tradition—which had waned while Gomes was sick—in tribute to the late Reverend and to create a place for members of the community to grieve.
“[The teas] were delightful and charming. If you had to put one word on it, they were a retreat,” Stanley said.

The 22nd Ig Nobel Ceremony—a prize ceremony that parodies the famous Nobel Prize by celebrating not the best, but the most bizarre that science has to offer—began on Thursday night with a thirty-second paper airplane deluge.
And from there it only became more bizarre. A motorized balloon clownfish floated around the auditorium throughout the night and a man and a woman covered in silver body paint held flashlights by the wings of Sanders Theater as “human spotlights” shining brightly upon the evening’s Ig Nobel prizewinners.
Marc Abrahams, the editor of Improbable Research—the organization that produces the prize ceremony—led the night’s festivities by welcoming the prizewinners, who he described as people who each in their own way “do something something that first makes you laugh, and then makes you think.”
The Ig Nobel prizewinners, ten in all, were awarded shiny hourglass-shaped awards by a handful of actual Nobel Prize winners for serious research with a humorous touch.
The winner of the Ig Nobel Prize for Chemistry was Johan Petterson. “I have made a study of small villages in Southern Sweden where hair had become green-tinted,”  said Petterson.
The Ig Nobel Prize for Anatomy was given to Frans de Waal and Jennifer Pokorny, who discovered that chimpanzees have the ability to recognize individual chimpanzees both by their faces and by their rear ends.
“They can look at a face and say this face belongs to this behind,” said de Waal. “It’s not an inborn capacity. They have to learn it.”
De Waal is a longtime fan of the Ig Nobels. “It generates a lot of excitement, because people want to have fun instead of [seeing] scientists always being presented in a very serious way,” he said.  “This is a moment we could laugh at it...although these are good studies.”
Abrahams shared this sentiment, saying in his opening remarks that “these achievements speak for themselves all too eloquently.”
The theme of the evening was “The Universe,” a catchword that had the audience cheering any time it was mentioned throughout the night.  Throughout the ceremony, a mini opera entitled “The Intelligent Designer and the Universe” premiered in four acts.
The opera’s final line was “This is how the Universe decays into insanity.”
The verdict is still out for the Universe, but for the Ig Nobels, it seemed this was the case indeed.
The Ig Nobel ceremony will be followed by an informal talk on Saturday at MIT with the Ig Nobel prizewinners. The Thursday ceremony will be broadcast on NPR the day after Thanksgiving as part of the ‘Science Friday’ show.

In honor of environmentalist Rachel Carson’s landmark novel “Silent Spring,” which turns fifty this month, the Harvard Institute of Politics is refocusing energy this week on the persistent danger of chemical exposure that Americans face every day.
In a talk entitled “The Science and Policy of Environmental Toxics and Breast Cancer” hosted at the John F. Kennedy Forum on Thursday night, leading scholars and environmentalists highlighted Carson’s pioneering fight to ban pesticide use—an effort that eventually resulted in a nationwide ban of insecticide DDT in 1972—in order to set the stage for discussion about chemicals that still escape regulation.
“Fifty years ago, Rachel Carson published the book ‘Silent Spring,’” said  C. M. Trey Grayson ‘94, the Director of the Institute of Politics in his opening remarks.  “If you look at the most important books in the 20th century, this is always at the top of the list and has had an incredible impact.”
The panel of speakers, who focused conversation on chemicals linked to the development of breast cancer, unanimously advocated for action and change to the current legislation and public disposition toward environmental policy.
“We have a sixty year time exposure of these ubiquitous chemical that we need to worry about,” said Julia G. Brody, the executive director of the Silent Spring Institute—a partnership of scientists and researchers concerned about environmental links to breast cancer.
Members of the panel shared personal experiences to convey their investment in the cause. Florence Williams, author of “Breasts: A Natural and Unnatural History,” recalled testing her breast milk after hearing of the current environmental risks.
“My breast milk came back with high levels of brominated flame retardants,” said Williams.  “It turns out that American women have levels [of these chemicals] ten to one hundred times higher than women anywhere else in the world”.
The speakers subsequently shifted the discussion to the possibility of increased government regulation of these hazardous chemicals, especially emphasizing the potential of voters to mobilize environmental action.
“What we need is a reenergizing of the public to create a new environment,” said panel speaker Sheila Jasanoff, the Pforzheimer Professor of Science & Technology Studies at Harvard Kennedy School.
The evening’s talk concluded with the announcement of the Rachel Carson Advocacy Award recipient. This year’s honoree, noted philanthropist and businesswoman Teresa Heinz, graciously accepted and related her story of becoming an environmentalist.  “
I became an environmentalist simply because that’s what it takes,” she said. “ I made the correlation between what to do, what to eat, and what to expose ourselves to because if you don’t you die. Simple.”

A peek inside the gated Eliot House courtyard on a typical day in September reveals students lounging in the sun as they enjoy the view of the Charles River.
But for the first time on one Saturday evening this fall, the courtyard will transform into a classy dance floor decked out in flowers and lights with music, hors d’oeuvre, drinks, and “maybe even fireworks,” according to an email sent to the House community.
Response to the House life satisfaction survey conducted over the summer indicated that there was student interest in having an another formal event in addition to Eliot’s Winter Formal in December and Fête, the spring formal dance, in April.
As a result of the survey, the Eliot House Committee decided to throw its first-ever September Soiree this Saturday.“
It’s a chance to have everyone outside [in the courtyard] when the weather is still nice,” HoCo Co-Chair Jordan E. Sessler ’13 said. “It’s also a chance to foster more unity in the House.”
Sessler said that the night will begin with classic American music, such as “Sweet Caroline,” while guests sip on drinks like shandy and sangria. As the night goes on, the Soiree will feature a DJ, a dance floor, and “everything else that makes a good event,” Sessler said.
“The sophomores will get to see what the House is all about, and the seniors will get the most out of the House experience for their last year,” said Erin M. Fahy ’13, Stein Club co-chair who is also in charge of organizing the September Soiree.
Fahy said that the event is significantly smaller in scale than Fête, Eliot’s highest-budget event of the year and one of the biggest spring formals at the College, with 900 attendees last year. The Soiree’s cost is about a third of the size of Fête’s roughly $20,000 budget, according to Sessler.
Though Soiree will be smaller, Fahy said she expects it will be similarly successful in fostering a sense of community in the House. The September Soiree is open to all Eliot students who pay $52 annual House dues. Each Eliot student is allowed to bring one guest.
According to Sessler, HoCo is “really invested” in making the September Soiree a success, adding that its budget is bigger than that of the Winter Formal. “Eliot is the best House,” Sessler said, “and we just want to make it better.”

BOSTON, Mass.—U.S. Senator Scott Brown and Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren exchanged barbs over taxes, energy, and family matters in the first televised debate of their highly contested U.S. Senate race Thursday night. Yet the back-and-forth evening, which turned as much on character as policy issues, provided an introduction to the candidates that was marked as much by similarities as by differences.
For Brown, a moderate Republican, the WBZ-TV debate was a chance to show the left-leaning Bay State his independent voting record and beliefs. He took the opportunity time and again to make clear his distance from the national Republican mainstream. Warren, the relative newcomer to the political stage, spent most of the evening challenging Brown on that record and laying out her own stances on the economy, the environment, and the Massachusetts race’s role in national politics.
The debate began with a question from the moderator, WBZ political analyst Jon Keller, about the much-discussed role of character in the race. Brown wasted no time in challenging Warren on claims she made about her ancestry while a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard. He alleged that Warren claimed Native American status to gain an advantage in the hiring process.
“Professor Warren claimed she was a person of color, and as you can see, she is not,” Brown said.
In denying Brown’s charges, Warren turned the conversation away from personal claims to Brown’s own record, which she said throughout the debate had hurt the people of Massachusetts. She singled out several job-creating bills that Brown voted against, accusing the senator of holding the middle class captive in his effort to preserve tax cuts for the top one percent of earners.
“I want to go to Washington to fight for jobs,” Warren said, later adding,“Let me say—I’ll make it crystal clear—I will never vote to raise taxes on working families, ever”
Brown refuted Warren’s claims, pointing out that the bills he struck down would have increased taxes on the middle class—something that he too pledged not to do. He said that Warren’s own plan for economic growth for Massachusetts would kill 700,000 jobs nationwide.
Discussing the environment, Brown said he is in favor of an “all of the above” solution, harnessing wind, solar, natural gas, geothermal, and other traditional energy sources like coal and oil to stimulate the economy while reducing climate-altering greenhouse gases. Warren said the country needs to start leaving polluting forms of energy behind.
The two candidates largely agreed on issues of foreign policy, women’s health and contraception, and education. Brown worked to show that his stances, which are more liberal than those of most of his party, are in line with Massachusetts Democratic voters. He said he supports abortion rights, low-interest loans for students, and withdrawal from Afghanistan.
“The bottom line here: The only way we are going to get this done is to work together in a bipartisan manner, and I’m the only one in this room right now that is going to do that,” Brown said, highlighting his willingness to cross the political aisle. “Professor Warren would vote with her party 100 percent of the time.”
Brown and Warren both spoke favorably of President Barack Obama, who has remained very popular in Massachusetts. Brown remained conspicuously silent when Warren poked at his support for fellow Massachusetts Republican Mitt Romney.
Warren concluded the debate by emphasizing the importance of the race nationally. “This really may be the race for the control of the U.S. Senate. So it’s not just about Senator Brown’s vote, it’s about the votes of all of the Republicans,” she said.
Polls have shown Brown and Warren running neck and neck in recent weeks. The next of three remaining televised debates is scheduled for Oct. 1 in Lowell, Mass.

This fall student activists launched the Harvard chapter of Divest for Our Future, a campaign intended to pressure Harvard Management Company, the body that oversees Harvard’s endowment, to divest from any companies involved in the fossil fuel industry and to move its investments into socially and environmentally responsible funds.
The campaign was originally launched by a regional student group called Students for a Just and Sustainable Future, which was founded several years ago to advocate for environmental issues at the national and state level, according to Alli J. Welton ‘15, a board member of the Harvard chapter of SJSF.
“At the national level, working with the political system is like working with a brick wall, because fossil fuel companies are giving so much money to candidates,” Welton said.
Welton said that the group hopes to tackle “the root of the problem” by taking away funding from corporations involved in fossil fuel, rather than relying on political change.
“We feel that there is a deep inconsistency in Harvard’s endowment practices, “ said Chloe S. Maxmin ’15, another board member of SJSF, in the press release announcing the launch of the campaign.
The group said that it cannot estimate the exact size of Harvard’s investments in fossil fuels because HMC’s investments are largely not accessible to the public.
The group’s press release also mentions Harvard’s alleged former investment in Massey Energy, a coal mining company whose safety violations caused the deaths of 29 miners in 2010.
However, Welton pointed out that Harvard has disclosed its investment in Petrobras, an oil extraction and distribution company in Brazil that drills offshore oil, a practice that may put the local environment at risk.
Maxmin said that the group would prefer that Harvard invest in “green funds” that they claim have returns similar to those of the fossil fuel industry. “We just want our money to be reinvested in a way that is not threatening our future,” she said.
Maxmin said that the group has begun raising awareness of the issue on campus by distributing “fact sheets” on Harvard’s investment practices.
“Climate change is probably the defining social justice issue of our time,” said Welton. “We have very few years left to really change fossil fuel practices before we’re locked into irreversible warming. It might seem abstract, but this takes its toll on people’s lives and the economy.”

UPDATED: September 22, 2012, at 1:58 a.m.
James L. Medoff, a respected Harvard economics professor and an expert in the role of unions in the American economy, died Saturday in Chelsea, Mass. He was 65.
Medoff, who passed away due to complications resulting from multiple sclerosis, arrived at Harvard after graduating from Brown in 1969 and never left—finishing a masters in economics in 1973 and a doctorate in the same field in 1975. He later earned tenure as the Meyer Kestnbaum Professor of Labor and Industry.
An influential voice in the field of labor economics, Medoff wrote his first book “What Do Unions Do?” in 1984 with friend and fellow Harvard professor Richard B. Freeman. It was a landmark work in their field, challenging common prejudices against unions and defending the organizations that their colleagues often criticized.
Medoff also advised companies such as IBM, The Boston Globe, and Ford Motor Company, and was a consultant for major unions including the National Association of Letter Carriers. He was considered an expert on the complicated collective bargaining issues that U.S. Postal workers face with government administration, and in 2004, testified before a Presidential Commission looking into the organization.
While much of this work took Medoff away from Cambridge, he always felt at home at Harvard and rushed to return to teaching, according to his son Justin Medoff.
“As soon as he arrived in Cambridge he just felt privileged to be there, to be a part of the Harvard community,” Justin said. “He wanted to contribute anything he could.”
His students recognized this dedication to the College and were especially drawn to his flamboyant and energetic lecturing style, said Economics concentration adviser Kiran Gajwani. She continued that Medoff’s courses were often some of the most popular in the department.
“He always said that he thought people would remember something, would understand something better if it was explained with energy,” Justin added.
“He tried to bring that energy—that flamboyance—to the classroom.”
Medoff was known for his wit and love of good humor inside and outside of class. According to Tyler B. Goodspeed, one of Medoff’s students and later his research assistant, there were always two tasks that Medoff took very seriously in his first class of the term. The first was to find volunteers to kick off his lecture with a joke. The second was to collect each of his students’ phone numbers, so he could call each personally.
“Yeah, he would call them,” Justin said. “That was a big thing with my dad, a commitment to work and to family.”
Medoff brought the same engagement and enthusiasm to his role as a father.
“Anything I got interested in, he’d get interested in, so we could do it together,” Just said. “We’d go to card shows, baseball games—any level, minors, college, whatever—and just be together.”
In addition to his son, Justin, Medoff is survived by his sister Joanne Darman Medoff and by his daughter Susanna, who graduated from the College in 2008.
“Having Susanna at Harvard, my dad was really, really proud of that,” said Justin. “He really enjoyed that.”

The post-game press conference was more crowded than usual following the Harvard football team’s season opening win over San Diego on Saturday. And not because more reporters were interested in following the Crimson’s on-the-field story. Instead, they were more concerned with the story that has dominated headlines for weeks now: the Government 1310 cheating scandal.
The issue was alluded to in the very first question posed to Harvard coach Tim Murphy, and the barrage of questions didn’t subside until the press conference’s conclusion. Below, we have transcribed all of the back-and-forths between reporters and the football team regarding the scandal. Naturally, thanks in part to Murphy’s ability to artfully answer—and evade—questions as necessary, that presented some interesting and at times humorous situations.
Reporter: “Tim, could you just talk about the week, the anticipation, and all the other distractions.”
Murphy: “What distractions?”
Reporter: “I don’t know, the soccer team?”
Murphy: “I think any time you start the season as relatively late as we do in the Ivy League, there’s tremendous anticipation because we’re seeing so much football from the end of August on, so it was great to play, it was great to get a win, it was great to come out of it relatively unscathed physically, and [I’m] just really proud of our kids. They played with a lot of poise, they played with a little bit of adversity, and hopefully those things will make us stronger going forward.”
Reporter: “Can you be more specific about the adversity part of it?”
Murphy: “Well, I know the question everyone wants to ask, and I’ll just answer it as best I can. I’ve been fortunate to coach at a lot of different types of schools. Probably can’t get three more different schools as a head coach than being the head coach at Maine, Cincinnati, and Harvard. And I’ll say this: Harvard kids aren’t good kids; they’re great kids. But they don’t walk on water. And I think it’s important as parents and educators that we have to reinforce that crucial life lesson that inappropriate behavior won’t be tolerated because down the road and later in life, those consequences can be terminal, can cost you a marriage, cost you a career. But I’ve never been around greater character kids here than we have here. Amazing kids. And that’s a huge part of the admissions process; everyone that applies here is relatively brilliant. So what’s the cutoff, how do you make the cut? You recruit great, admit great character kids.”
***
Reporter: “Coach, to your knowledge, are any of the players on your original football roster being investigated in this academic investigation, plagiarism case we talked about? Have any left school?”
Murphy: “As you probably know, because of the privacy laws governing student records, we’re not allowed to talk about that, and I know that may frustrate people, but that’s the truth. We’re not allowed to talk about the academic records and/or status of any of our kids. It’s protected by—I forget what the actual statute is—but we’re not allowed to talk about it.”
Reporter: “Was there any impact on the roster or the depth chart?”
Murphy: “Well, people have asked me that, and the thing I’ve told them is, to my knowledge, all 24 of our starters that came out of spring ball and are coming into preseason—all of them were in a good academic standing.”
Reporter: “Can you also say whether or not there’s any impact on your preparation for the game because of that—?”
Murphy: “You know, there really wasn’t, for this simple reason: If we had a situation, if we didn’t have a situation, it’s all about focus. We talk about it all the time. We talk about two things: adversity and focus. And the thing we really pride ourselves on is no matter what’s happening around us—whether there is, isn’t, whether it’s injuries, whether it’s any of the things you folks talk about, it’s all about focus, not making excuses, getting prepared to play, and dealing with whatever adversity comes our way. We talk about, ‘Hey, you’ve got to not only expect but embrace if our first-team quarterback goes down on the first play of the game. He’s done for the year.’ Two years ago, we were down to our third quarterback after two games. So these are things we focus on constantly: Dealing with adversity and being a tough, resilient team.”
***
Reporter: “Treavor [Scales], can you kind of talk about the past week, what it’s been like given the distractions that the coach was talking about? From the players' standpoint.”
Scales: “You know, like Coach said, you deal with adversity. We’ve gone through adversity training with our training regimen in the offseason. We’re up so early in the morning walking across in what seems to me like, being from Georgia, six feet of snow. It’s something you train for throughout the offseason—any adversity that comes your way, you put your head down, you bite down, and you grind through it. So we’ve had that mentality as a team. And distractions, adversity, whatever you call it, we powered through, and I’m proud of that.”
***
Reporter: “Coach, I think you can answer this question. You have 119 guys on the roster. How many of them were on the sideline today?”
Murphy: “A lot.”
Reporter: “Yeah, there were a lot.”
Murphy: “A lot. Yea, people ask me, you know, will ask you at times, ‘How many kids do you have?’ And I’ve said, ‘Three in Wayland and 119 in Cambridge.’ So, you understand why coaches don’t get any sleep at night.”
Reporter: “Can you say, I mean, just in number, how many people are unavailable for—”
Murphy: “No, obviously I cannot.”
Reporter: “Even without putting names on it, it’s not...”
Harvard Assistant Director of Athletics Kurt Svoboda: “Anything else?”
Reporter: “I have one more thing. Bobby [Schneider], on campus, there’s quite a bit of conversation about this case. It’s in newspapers, it’s everywhere. How prevalent is the conversation amongst your peers or players [on the team]?”
Schneider: “To be honest with you, we don’t really talk about it. First of all, we can’t talk about specifics, as has been said. It’s not something we’re constantly thinking about. Obviously, there’s other people talking about it. Be that as it may, we’re going to fight through, we’re going to keep pushing, team morale is high, coming off this victory. We’re just going to keep going, keep pushing through. It’s not affecting us. We’ll be all right.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off a tough 28-13 victory over San Diego last week, the Harvard football team will look to extend its 10-game winning streak in its Ivy League opener on Saturday afternoon at Brown.
The Crimson (1-0) faces off against a tough Bears (1-0) squad in front of a hostile Brown crowd in its first nationally televised game of the season.
“You love to go to a place where they hate you because it’s the same magnitude of volume; you walk into the stadium, and it’s all boos,” senior running back Treavor Scales said.  “You look forward to environments like this, because you put in all that passion, all that pride, and you let it all hang out when you go into an environment like that.”
Between the Bears and the Crimson, the home team has won each of the last four matchups. In 2011 at Harvard Stadium, the Crimson scored 10 points in the final seven minutes to secure a 24-7 victory over Brown. Harvard went on to sweep Ivy League play, while the Bears finished tied for second at 4-3.
For the Crimson, an early-season loss to the Bears on Saturday would put a serious dent in the team’s title hopes.
“It’s always a tough game. I believe the last four years, this game has had title implications,” captain Bobby Schneider said. “We’re definitely looking at it as [if] it’s the most important game we have on our schedules. It’s a must-win.”
Senior quarterback Colton Chapple, who for the first time began the season as the starter, will lead the offense against the Bears following a historic season in 2011. Chapple uncharacteristically struggled with consistency against the Toreros, completing 16 of 29 passes for 209 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception.
With the passing game stalled, the Crimson relied more on Scales. Behind a talented offensive line, Scales ran for a career-high 173 yards and two fourth-quarter touchdowns that sealed the win for the Crimson.
“[Scales is] critical,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “Treavor’s one of the five best offensive players in the entire league at any position…. He can do it all. He’s not only a fast, athletic, tough, physical, good pass protector, [and] can catch the ball...[but] he’s a tremendous leader.”
Scales will be tested against a stout Bears defense, which held the Holy Cross running game to under 100 yards last week.
On the other side of the ball, the Crimson defensive line will look to continue its high level of pressure after last week’s showing against San Diego, when the team sacked the opposing quarterback seven times, forced an interception, and held the Toreros running backs to just 35 yards. But the win exposed weaknesses in the Harvard secondary, which allowed over 350 passing yards for the first time in almost a decade.
The team also struggled with penalties, tallying 66 penalty yards on eight flags, one of which negated a touchdown run.
“We’re not going tolerate penalties, no matter who it is,” Murphy said. “I think it reinforces how important playing mistake-free football is. The mistakes aren’t just turnovers, they’re not just missed assignments, but probably the biggest mistake is penalties. We’ll get it squared away.”
Like Harvard, Brown is coming off a hard-fought season opener. Led by tailback Spiro Theodhosi, the Bears pulled off their own come-from-behind victory, 24-21, over Holy Cross last week.
Senior quarterback Patrick Donnelly made his first start against the Crusaders, leading the Bears on a game-winning touchdown drive late in the fourth quarter. Theodhosi, who missed the last two seasons due to injury, also had a career-high 120 rushing yards, though he and counterpart senior tailback Mark Kachmer face a much tougher test this week against the stingy Crimson defensive line.
Although the Bears have an All-American cornerback in AJ Cruz, who had an interception in the game against Holy Cross, Brown’s secondary allowed 223 yards through the air last week.
Though the Bears’ offense remains a question mark following the graduation of two of its key players—quarterback Kyle Newhall-Caballero and wide receiver Alex Tounkara-Kane , the Crimson is treating the Bears like any other opponent.
“We’re going to have to at least match their intensity,” Murphy said. “When you’re playing one of the better teams in the league, when you’re playing a team that has you marked as their biggest game on the schedule, then you have no excuse for not being ready to play, not being excited, not being prepared. So we have no excuses.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a lopsided 8-1 loss to crosstown rival Boston College last Saturday, the Harvard women’s soccer team hits the road this weekend looking to set its season back on track.
The Crimson (3-2-1) opens Ivy League play on Friday, when they travel down to the University of Pennsylvania (3-3-0) to battle the Quakers in front of their home crowd on Rhodes Field.
Both teams have had successful starts to their 2012 campaigns and will be looking for a key win against an Ancient Eight rival.
“It’s extremely important to bounce back [after last week’s game against BC],” freshman Emily Mosbacher said. “It was a tough loss, but it’s made us stronger as a team for it. We were able to learn a lot about our playing style, what works and what doesn’t.”
Going into Friday’s game, the two teams already have a long history. Last season, Harvard handed the Quakers one of their only two losses, subsequently snatching its tenth Ivy League title.
The Crimson leads the all-time overall contest, 16-5-2, and has won two of the last five meetings between the teams, with one of those wins coming in the conference season opener last year.
Entering this match, Harvard is stressing the effect that a win will have on the rest of its season.
“It’s definitely a big game,” senior Aisha Price said. “We’ve talked a lot about how starting on Friday, it’s a new season, it’s the Ivy League season. We want to come out and start with a bang, but at the same time we’re trying to take it one game at a time and go as hard as we can for every game.”
Despite the loss to the Eagles last weekend, the Crimson has had a successful start to its campaign, grabbing two vital wins on the road against Colgate and Quinnipiac.
Penn is currently coming off a double-overtime win over Sacramento State, snapping a three game mini-slide that saw the Quakers outscored, 4-0.
Offensively, Harvard has shown an array of options, with nine different players finding the back of the net and the offense averaging two goals a game. Senior Taryn Kurcz, who is also a Crimson sports editor, currently leads the Crimson with three goals, while junior co-captain Peyton Johnson has contributed one goal and four assists. Junior Elizabeth Weisman has also tallied two goals and one assist.
The team’s first years have proved their mettle thus far this season. Mosbacher and classmates midfielder Haley Washburn and forward Lauren Varela have each chipped in a goal for Harvard this season.
Heading into Friday’s contest, Harvard has the advantage in shots per game, averaging 16.2 to Penn’s 13.5.The Crimson’s defense has also been steady thus far this season, anchored by sophomore Bethany Kanten in the net. Kanten has started in all six games, posting 28 saves, a 71.8 save percentage, and a 2.11 goals-against average.
Kanten is set to face a well-balanced Quaker offense. Each of Penn’s seven goals this season have come from different players.
Freshman Erin Mikolai and juniors Kerry Scalora and Brianna Rano have each scored game-winning goals. Scalora has also tallied an assist on the season, and leads Penn in shots, with 16.
On defense for the Quakers, senior Sarah Banks has played every minute in goal, posting 20 saves, a 74.1 save percentage, and a 1.14 goals-against average.
Harvard thus far has been undefeated on the road, outscoring its opponents, 8-1, with victories at Massachusetts, Colgate, and Quinnipiac. Penn has gone 2-1, playing in front of its home crowd at Rhodes Field.
Both teams have struggled with getting hot early in the game.
With the Crimson scoring nine of its 12 goals in the second half and the Quakers only seeing one of its seven goals come during the first period, Harvard and Penn will both be seeking score and gain momentum early.
“Penn is a really strong team, especially to have to play away,” Mosbacher said. “Knowing that, we’re ready for whatever they bring.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After losing its Ivy League opener, the Harvard field hockey team looks to pick up its first win in conference play when it travels to Franklin Field to play Penn on Saturday. After winning its first game against Holy Cross, the team has dropped its last four in a row, with the most recent game 2-1 overtime loss against Yale last Saturday.
The Crimson (1-4) has defeated the Quakers (4-3) each of the past two years, including its last trip to Franklin Field when it walked away with a 2-0 win. This is the Crimson’s second conference game of the year as it hopes to win the Ivy League for the first time since 2004. The team is aiming to take advantage of a soft schedule early in the Ivy season.
“One of our big goals for this season is definitely to improve our Ivy League performance,” co-captain Kim Goh said. “There are a lot of teams in the Ivy League that we feel we can beat, especially a couple coming up, so we want to make sure we capitalize on that opportunity.”
The team returns eight starters from last year’s fifth place squad, which finished one spot above the Quakers after tying them for last place in the conference in 2010.
Although Harvard has managed only four goals in four losses this year, the offense has produced 28 shots (10 on goal) in their last two games after only managing 19 (nine on goal) in the first three games combined. Goh noted that the team has become more willing to take risks as they adjust to the format of new coach Tjerk van Herwaarden’s offense.
“We are getting much better at working with the structure [of our offense],” Goh said. “Our strength is getting a sense of when to up the tempo and push forward and when to hold the ball back and get control of the game. We are getting a better sense of how to gauge the game and play the tempo. We’re feeling pretty good heading into this weekend.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s water polo team (5-5) opens up conference play this weekend with a busy slate of four games in three days. After a Friday night showdown with local rival MIT (4-6), the Crimson will face Fordham (1-12) and Iona (1-6) at home on Saturday and will conclude the weekend by travelling to take on Connecticut College (1-3).
Although the team has experienced both hot and cold spells so far this season, posting a .500 record in its first three non-conference tournaments, Harvard enters conference play with two consecutive wins under its belt. The Crimson pulled out a decisive, 16-9 victory over Mercyhurst last Saturday and took advantage of a fourth-quarter comeback to defeat George Washington the next day.
“Those were two good wins for us,” junior goalie Jimmy Field said. “We’ve been trying to have good, strong practices and have been getting ourselves pumped up for the MIT game.”
Both Harvard and the Engineers boast three main scoring threats. Rookies Blake Lee, Ben Zepfel, and Noah Harrison have led the Crimson offense so far this season, with 23, 18, and 13 goals, respectively. MIT has relied upon Kale Rogers, Ory Tasman, and Craig Cheney for most of its scoring.
Harvard lost to the Engineers 19-7 on Sept. 1, but the team is excited about getting another shot at MIT before a large crowd.
“MIT is a big rivalry game,” Crimson coach Ted Minnis said. “We split a lot of the time. They’ve already beaten us this year, so it should be a lot of fun, and I think our guys are ready for a tough test against the Engineers.”
After Friday’s matchup, Harvard will face the Rams and the Gaels at Blodgett Pool on Saturday. Both opponents have struggled recently to produce much offense, and Iona has not won since defeating Gannon in its first game of the season.
The Crimson will finish up its opening round of conference play in New London, Conn., by taking on Connecticut College, which has only played four games so far this year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard basketball has recently taken another turn in the national spotlight—this time for all the wrong reasons. A whirlwind of commentary and debate have followed the high-profile withdrawals of the team’s two captains, Kyle Casey ’13 and Brandon Curry ’13, who were both implicated in the widespread cheating scandal of last spring. In the wake of their departures, some have raised questions about the role of athletics at Harvard, while others have noted  the now muted enthusiasm for a team that captured the campus’s attention and brought rare athletic pride and excitement to the University less than six months ago.
But don’t be fooled—this is not the death of Harvard basketball as we knew it. In fact, Tommy Amaker and Co. have ample reason to be excited for the future, so long as a few key decisions go their way.

As two Crimson columnists discussed, Harvard’s expectations for the 2012-13 season ought to be tempered given it will arguably be losing its two most important players. But a little speculation further into the future reveals undeniable potential for a return to the top.
If Casey and Curry are permitted to return to the team after year-long stints off-campus (and, of course, assuming they choose to do so), the Crimson could assemble one of the strongest Ivy-League rosters in recent memory for the 2013-14 season. Curry, whose heady play and offensive command landed him on the second All-Ivy team last season, would be reassuming his role at the point. Casey would return to the frontcourt, presumably still a frontrunner for the Ivy League Player of the Year Award just as he was before the scandal. 
You can add to the mix four-star power forward recruit Zena Edosomwan, who has verbally committed to Harvard and would join the team just in time for Curry and Casey’s return if all goes according to plan. 
And then, of course, there are the underclassmen on the current roster who will have a further year of collegiate experience. We can still expect to see sharpshooter Laurent Rivard ’14 knocking shots down fromthe wing, and the Crimson would enjoy a truly balanced offensive attack if sophomore Wes Saunders continues to emerge as a bona fide scorer. Throw in the depth provided by current sophomores Steve Moundou-Missi, Jonah Travis, and Kenyatta Smith and Harvard looks like the hands-down favorite to win the Ivy League. 
Of course, all of this is speculation; the 2013-14 season is a long way off. There is no guarantee that Casey and Curry will be back, and the current team is undoubtedly concerned exclusively with the task in front of it. While this has been an undeniable setback for Harvard basketball, it is far from a decimation. Perhaps once high expectations for the upcoming season have shrunk, but the program’s future is far from bleak, and there is no indication that the magic of last spring was merely an aberration.

September 19, 1946: Thumping Loudly, University Band's Drums Will Again Be on Field Between Halves
Not since the fall of 1942 has a Harvard band sprawled its comely H's across a white-striped green gridiron come half-time at Soldiers Field on a crisp Saturday afternoon. But this year, things are different, and the Harvard University Band, the only band in the country controlled exclusively by its members, will once again cavort before weekend throngs at all nine (count 'em, nine) football games this year.

September 18, 1969: Burglar Slips As He Tries To Remove Gutenberg Bible from Widener Library
A daring burglar came within inches of successfully stealing Harvard's Gutenberg Bible from its resting place in Widener Library on August 19.
He succeeded in foiling the library's alarm system, and removing the Bible from its plastic display case, but appears to have slipped when he attempted to climb down a rope hanging out of a library window. He fell some 40 feet to the ground outside.
The burglary suspect, identified as Vido K. Aras, 20, of Dorchester was found unconscious outside the library in the morning with the two volumes of the Bible in a knapsack beside him.
September 21, 1973: 'Cliffe to Yard Shuttle Buses Begin Monday
Harvard will begin an experimental bus service for students and employees between the Yard, Radcliffe, and the Business School on September 24.
The free shuttles will operate seven days a week from 4 p.m. to 2 a.m.
September 21, 1979: Hospitals Gear Up for Pope's Arrival
Visiting the Pope may be hazardous to your health.
At least, medical personnel around Boston seem to think so. They are putting together an elaborate network of medical facilities to serve the unprecedented crowds expected October 1 on Boston Common to celebrate Mass with Pope John Paul II.
Boston hospitals and the American Red Cross will set up nine first-aid stations in the common, and more than 30 special ambulances—both public and private—will be on duty during the Pope's visit, Lenworth Jacobs, director of emergency services for Boston City Hospital, said yesterday.

Okay, let's face it. Apple Maps has pretty much been an epic failure. The new app, which has replaced Google Maps on any Apple product where the newest software, iOS 6, has been installed, has made a number of (rather serious) mapping errors. As The Huffington Post reports, Apple Maps has placed the city of Hong Kong on the wrong island, reopened stores that are most definitely closed (Woolworth's, anyone?), mislabeled the Sears Tower in Chicago, erased Stratford Upon Avon completely, and more.
To add to all of that, according to Apple Maps, the Harvard Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine, is now located at the Harvard Business School.
To members of the Lampoon: it looks like the prank's on you.
