Minnesota has a history of less traditional politicians. Five years before California voted for Arnold Schwarzenegger to be the “governator”, Minnesota elected Jesse “The Body” Ventura, a former professional wrestler, as its top executive. Now, more than a decade later, the Minnesota State Canvassing Board has declared that Democrat Al Franken, former comedian and Saturday Night Live writer, has defeated Republican Norm Coleman after a lengthy recount. We commend Minnesota for being prepared for close elections and for dutifully carrying out the recount in the face of a press frenzy. Hopefully other states will look to this process as an example of how to avoid the Florida debacle of the 2000 presidential elections. 
One crucial factor is that Minnesota already had an election law in place to handle close elections, which mandated a hand recount in contests with a margin of victory smaller than 0.5 percent. Coleman’s razor-thin 0.0075 percent margin of victory over Franken in November failed to meet the cutoff, automatically triggering the recount. Unlike the Florida presidential election in 2000, during which Gore had to fight in court to get a recount, in this case there was no question of whether a recount was in order. 
Equally important is the fact that Minnesota’s voting machines leave a clean paper trail, which allowed the recount to take place. If, for instance, Georgia’s recent senatorial runoff election resulted in a similarly small margin, there would have been no possible hand recount. Georgia’s electronic voting machines are paperless—electronic machines typically don’t allow for a hand recount to double check the electronic tally. In contrast, every Minnesota voter marked a paper ballot. This allowed officials to go back and at least try to discern for whom each person voted.    
Although Coleman’s lawsuit challenging the recount results may be legitimately founded, it exposes the emptiness of his earlier calls for Franken to concede the election. On Nov. 5, Coleman triumphantly declared “Yesterday the voters spoke, We prevailed.” He then cast doubt on whether a recount would be worth the time and tax dollars, going so far as to say he would “step back” if he were in Franken’s position.  Coleman’s current lawsuit contesting the election results now reveals the hollowness of his previous rhetoric. Even supposing that Coleman’s contentions are legitimate, he should have watched his mouth before or stuck to his guns and accepted the results of the recount without a challenge—now he looks like a liar, a sore loser, or perhaps both.

“Caroline Kennedy is going to be the next senator from New York, so get on board now.”  So spoke a top aide within the New York mayor’s office, according to phone records obtained by the New York Times. But the union leader on the other end of the line shouldn’t have been surprised to hear it. A number of influential sources, from politicians to journalists, have already pegged Caroline Kennedy as the front runner for Hilary Clinton’s soon-to-be-vacant senate seat.
Not everyone is so gung-ho. Over the past few days, the legitimacy of a Kennedy senatorship has been hashed and rehashed by pundits, politicians, and the people themselves. Still, if Kennedy is to be handed the seat, American voters should be concerned, and not just because the prospect reeks of dynastic politics. Her case is merely the latest and most blatant example of how politicians’ personalities eclipse the ideas they represent.
Supporters praise Kennedy for her charm, her bestselling book, and her dedication to education advocacy. Critics attack her on the same grounds, as the recent charges of her inarticulateness make clear. Lost in all the vitriol is any real interest in her policy views. 
Even if the press were dying for a clear delineation of her platform, they wouldn’t have much to go on. Kennedy’s op-ed in the New York Times last January marked the first time she has publicly endorsed a candidate for office. While she has, in the past few weeks, taken a public stand on media-friendly issues like same-sex marriage and school vouchers, she continually side-steps questions about how she might depart from the party line. Even her editorial, entitled “A President Like My Father,” neglects any argument for Obama’s policies, extolling instead his inspirational character.  Kennedy may indeed be capable, but if so, she is hiding it well; New Yorkers have at this point no reason to believe that Caroline Kennedy will actually represent them if appointed. That she is still a top contender despite this portends an ominous turn for American politics.
Kennedy’s candidacy manifests a problem more serious than one Senate seat, however. Political discourse is beginning to feel more like a clash of personality cults than a real debate. This type of discourse was all too prevalent this past election, when we heard more about McCain’s “maverick” brand and the antics of his running mate than we did his economic policy, and more about Obama’s immutable  “hope” than his actual agenda. Indeed, despite the unique confluence of a crashing economy and a vice presidential opponent who provided day after day of material for SNL, it is hard to deny that Barack Obama owes a great deal to his messianic, “presidential” persona.
The politics of personality are certainly nothing new to the American political game; leaders from Washington to Reagan have ridden their charismatic poise to the White House. But as history has shown, precarious times tend to breed particularly ready discipleship. With disquiet overseas and recession on the domestic horizon, there is an aura of unconditional public trust around the man many call the next Jack Kennedy that is already putting his decisions unsettlingly above scrutiny.
At 72 percent and rising, Obama’s Gallup approval ratings have been surpassed by only two newly elected presidents since FDR: Kennedy approaching the peak of the cold war, and Johnson after Kennedy’s assassination. “That’s the sort of rating you see when the public rallies around a leader after a national disaster,” CNN analyst Bill Schneider remarked last month. Put another way, Americans are seeing a savior where they should see a Democrat.
Granted, a leader’s ability to inspire shouldn’t be underestimated, and Caroline Kennedy’s star power could well bring a good chunk of federal funding to New York. But the most fundamental part of representing a constituency is voting for them. Even in times of uncertainty, Americans need to step far enough back from political celebrities to keep sight of where they are leading us. Some may be shocked to discover that admiration is not always synonymous with agreement.

Article 13 of the charter for Hamas—a terrorist group elected by the people of the Gaza Strip as their so-called “government”—reads as follows: “[Peace] initiatives, the so-called peaceful solutions, and the international conferences to resolve the Palestinian problem, are all contrary to the beliefs of the Islamic Resistance Movement.”  In other words, any sort of peaceful solution in which Israel continues to exist is simply unacceptable to Hamas. Faced with this stark reality—that, until Israel is wiped off the map, Hamas will not stop its campaign of terror—Israel is absolutely justified in its defensive actions against Hamas.  
While critics have charged that Israel continues to instigate the admittedly tragic violence in the region, they ignore the numerous efforts that the Israeli government has made to end the conflict. In the past decade, Israel has offered to withdraw from 97 percent of the West Bank, and has also unilaterally removed its forces from the Gaza Strip. But apparently even these well-intentioned efforts are not enough for the radical Hamas leadership, which has repeatedly refused to recognize Israel as a state and has called for its complete destruction. As Israel is—understandably—not going to eliminate itself in an attempt for peace, it is left with no options other than military retaliation in order to persuade Hamas to cease its terrorism. 
Many people have protested Israel’s actions, arguing that its military response has been disproportionate. With all due respect, they are dead wrong. Would it be preferable if Israel fired several rockets into homes in Gaza every day without giving warning, like Hamas? After all, Hamas has not demonstrated much concern for Israeli civilians; in fact, it has repeatedly and indiscriminately fired rockets at Israeli settlements on undisputedly Israeli territory. If Israel were to do the same to Gaza—which it most assuredly has not—then it would be condemned in nearly every corner of the world. But Hamas, a radical terrorist group devoted to the overthrow of a legitimate state, apparently gets a free pass. 
Nor has Hamas shown much compassion for its own people, for it often uses civilians—whom it knows Israel will go to great lengths not to kill—in order to carry out its missions. In 2006, armed Hamas terrorists barricaded themselves inside a mosque. Palestinian women gathered outside, and the terrorists managed to dress themselves in the women’s garb and escape, knowing that Israel would not fire at a group of people without knowing who among the group was the real target.  
The international community has criticized Israel’s response on the basis of humanitarian concerns. It is true that the humanitarian crisis in Gaza should not be ignored. But, while many have chastised Israel for its blockade of Gaza, it is imperative to remember that there would be no need for such a drastic measure if Hamas had not started the violence against Israel. Moreover, Israel has attempted on several occasions to relieve the worst of the suffering in Gaza. Even though its Defense Forces are engaged in active combat, Israel has sent more than 10,000 tons of humanitarian aid into Gaza. 
Despite propagandistic appeals bemoaning the welfare of Palestinian civilians, Hamas has done little to actually improve their situation. It has even been reported that Hamas—a “government” that should be providing for the basic needs of its people—has diverted medicine and supplies that Israel delivered for civilians in order to care for its soldiers.  And the outrageous behavior has not been limited to a mere diversion of aid supplies. During last week’s humanitarian cease-fire, Hamas insurgents continued to fire rockets and small arms at Israeli aid convoys and settlements. It is horrifying that Hamas would first cry that its people are being unjustly deprived of humanitarian aid and then, when that aid is being delivered, take advantage of Israel’s generosity in order to inflict further harm. 
There is also a fundamental disconnect between what critics of Israel have loudly proclaimed and what they have actually done to ameliorate the plight of Palestinian people. It is true that innocent civilians in Gaza lack some necessities. But instead of “aiding” the Palestinians by supplying them with missiles and mortars, Syria, Iran, and other countries in the region could provide them with much-needed food and medicine. A concrete improvement in the lives of everyday Palestinians will only occur when the incessant Hamas-instigated violence in the region has come to an end. But unfortunately for the long-suffering Palestinian people, this Gazan “government” doesn’t actually seem to be interested in either real peace or economic growth.
Many individuals, private organizations and national governments have repeatedly called on Israel to stop its military operations in Gaza. But where were the calls for peace when Hamas fired 771 rockets and 857 mortar-bombs at Sderot and the Negev from June 2007 to February 2008?  Where were the calls for a cessation of violence when Hamas broke last year’s cease-fire? It is high time for the international community to draw the line on Hamas’ destructive behavior and realize that, until Hamas is out of power, Israel will be left with no other option than to defend its mere existence.

We’ve been going about this all wrong. As I perused the paper after reveille last Friday, I couldn’t help but feel a mite more morose than usual, a dose more dolorous. Nine AIDS activists in Dakar, in the supposed shining citadel of West African democracy, had been sentenced to eight years imprisonment upon suspicion of homosexual conduct. Even more shocking was the well-worn statement issued by the NGO Human Rights Watch (HRW): merely, that the Senegalese state had violated Article 7 of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, and that the doctrine of natural rights demanded that the prisoners’ shackles be burst asunder post-haste.If human rights advocates are to establish a relevant global code of ethics, they must jettison this language of abstract rights in favor of a consensus anchored in the universalist elements of cultures around the world. Advocates must sincerely acknowledge cultural context in order to effectively address issues of common human welfare. The platform of human rights must shift from supracultural abstraction—“universally rational” values which ultimately rest upon Western liberalism—toward intercultural and intracultural pragmatism. Article 7 of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders asserts that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to develop and discuss new human rights ideas and principles and to advocate their acceptance.” The HRW notes that LGBT activists, such as Mr. Diadji Diouf and his colleagues, have a high propensity for victimization via violation of Article 7.But what does this mean to the Senegalese state and the 94 percent of its citizens following Shar’ia law? To them, gay rights assaults Islamic virtue and communal integrity, and the HRW claims are simply ethical imperialism. Dr. Onuma Yasuaki, University of Tokyo law professor, notes that “for those who have experienced colonial rule and interventions under such beautiful slogans as humanity and civilization”, human rights look like more slogans to rationalize intervention. Human rights are tough to traffic wholesale. As for the case last Friday, if human rights defenders desire liberties and immunities for the AIDS activists they must engage supportive elements of Shar’ia law, making their advocacy culturally palpable, even though most tenets of Shar’ia law concerning homosexual behavior condemn it. But freedom for the AIDS activists will depend more upon the respect for privacy and due process inherent in Islamic legal culture and scripture than the right for men to have sex with other men.Only one passage in the Qu’ran explicitly acknowledge homosexuality: “If two men commit unchastity with each other, punish them both. And if they repent and improve, then let them be. Lo! Allah is Relenting, Mericful. (4.16)” Since no method of punishment is indicated, Shar’ia law leaves punishment to the judiciary. In the case of Senegal, Penal Article 319.3 provides that “whoever commits an improper or unnatural act with a person of the same sex will be punished by imprisonment of between one and five years.”This law, however, has not been invoked much in secular Senegal until now. Generally, as Imam Amadou Kanté acknowledges, homosexuality is treated much like public drunkenness. It is okay, he says, to be drunk in private, but not in public. But he is clear to note that in private or public, Islam does not sanction homosexuality. So why were nine AIDS activists arrested with only lubricants and condoms—standard HIV-prevention tools—as supposed evidence of private homosexual conduct?The answer is that several authorities are guilty of the same sin as the HRW: disregard for historical and cultural context. Ignorance of the wide history of Shari’a law has permitted judges to antagonize gays.A study by International Human Rights Committee member Osama Daneshyar finds that Shar’ia law historically protects most private behavior without qualification. It stems from a commandment in the Qu’ran for humility on the parts of would-be prosecutors, namely “Thou Shall Not Spy”. The invasion of a private Muslim residence is ungrounded. Scripture also condemns locking up a prisoner for months only on suspicion charges. Again, this is upon the decree that only Allah “knows the depths our hearts”, rather than secular rights granted to human agents, but international advocates would still be wise to cite and incorporate these elements in their struggle.Deneshyar notes that there is a clause which permits interference if illicit behavior is of a public nature. The public activity of Diadji Diouf and his colleagues, however, was not homosexual behavior. It was fighting AIDS, a disease for which Senegal receives funds from the World Bank to battle.  AIDS strikes people indiscriminant of sexual orientation, and is ironically exacerbated by homophobia.Overall, the chances of the activists being released are thin. But they are even thinner if cultural context is disregarded. Far in the future there might be a point in which homosexuality can find some immunity within Islam. Indeed, Islam has a tradition of moral universalism which predates most Western discourse on human rights.For now, if the issue at hand truly is consensus on a universal set of liberties and immunities for the spiritual and material well-being of Mr. Diadji Douifi and his colleagues, then we must move away from supracultural abstraction and blunt application of the language of individual rights, and toward an intercultural, intracultural, and ultimately more democratic pragmatism, toward the creative anchoring of human rights in multiple ways of being in the world.Raúl A.

Princeton’s endowment has declined 11 percent from July 1 to the end of October, President Shirley M. Tilghman announced in a university-wide letter last Thursday.Tilghman wrote that it was “prudent” to anticipate a decline of possibly 25 percent for the year, from a June 30 value of $16.3 billion.Over the same period, Harvard’s endowment fell by a similar proportion: 22 percent from a June 30 value of $36.9 billion. Yale University also reported losing one quarter of its endowment, projecting a decrease from $22 billion to $17 billion by year’s end.Unlike the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, which Harvard Magazine has noted is comparable in size to Princeton as a whole, Princeton has not announced a hiring freeze.“We should not put at risk the foundations we have so recently laid,” Tilghman wrote of staff recruiting.Princeton will continue searches for new faculty already authorized. Any requests to conduct new faculty searches or resume old searches, however, will be reviewed by Dean of the Faculty David P. Dobkin.A review committee will also review all searches for term, temporary, and regular employment.Princeton relies more heavily on its endowment for operating budgets than Harvard does. On average, the endowment contributed 34 percent of the operating budget of each of Harvard University’s schools in fiscal year 2008.In comparison, 45 percent of Princeton’s projected operating budget for 2008-2009—or $534.6 million—relies on the endowment, said Emily R. Aronson, a media officer in Princeton’s Office of Communications, in an e-mail.Behind the 34 percent average, Harvard’s schools vary in their dependence on endowment funds for operations.Hardest hit have been the Radcliffe Institute of Advanced Study and the Divinity School, both of which utilize the endowment for over 70 percent of their operating budgets.Tilghman said several construction projects already under way at Princeton will continue. She did add, however, that all new projects will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.According to Tilghman, the new allocations will still be higher than they were four years ago, before several years of major increases.The blow to Princeton’s endowment will not have significant impacts on students, at least for now.“I’ve told [Financial Aid Director] Robin Moscato to meet every single request and to make sure there is not a single student who leaves because he or she can’t meet the financial obligation to the University,” Tilghman told Princeton University’s news office in November.Students not on financial aid will likely see a 2.9 percent increase in tuition, Tilghman wrote in the letter. This figure represents the smallest percentage increase since 1966.This increase, recommended by Princeton’s Priorities Committee, will pay for tuition, room, and board, Aronson said. The recommendation must be approved by Princeton’s Board of Trustees, who are responsible for fee packages.The biggest losers within Princeton will be tenured faculty and higher-level administrators, for whom salary increases will be capped at $2,000.Princeton’s scholarship budget is expected to rise 13 percent from $92 million to $104 million, Aronson said.This figure includes increases in scholarship amounts already awarded this year to families affected by the financial crisis, as well as a projected 56 to 58 percent increase in students requiring financial aid.In her letter, Tilghman concluded with a cautionary note, warning that future fiscal finagling may become necessary.“It is likely that this year’s downturn will require creative planning for not only the upcoming budget year but later ones,” she wrote.­—Staff writer Alexander R.

President-elect Barack Obama has reportedly chosen a Harvard Law School classmate, Julius R. Genachowski, to head the Federal Communications Commission, adding yet another Harvard affiliate to the future President’s administration.Genachowski, who was an editor of the Harvard Law Review when Obama was its president, is friendly with the President-elect from their time at the Law School, and overlapped with Obama during their undergraduate years at Columbia. He helped draft the Obama campaign’s technology platform, and worked on Obama’s record-breaking fundraising Web site.As chairman of the FCC, Genachowski will take the reins of an organization that has become increasingly relevant with the rise of the Internet and information technology such as wireless communications.His first task will likely be to oversee the nation-wide transition to digital television that Congress has set for Feb. 17. Obama has already asked for a delay to allow Americans more time to obtain coupons for converter boxes for their analog TV sets.During the campaign, Genachowski backed Obama’s support for net neutrality, advocating against allowing Web sites to pay a premium for faster delivery of content. The campaign’s technology platform focused on more widespread and affordable Internet access.Genachowski was chief council to FCC Chairman Reed Hundt during the Clinton administration. He has since worked as a senior executive at IAC/Interactive Corporation.Genachowski and Obama were both in University Professor Laurence H. Tribe’s constitutional law section at the Law School. The two were also research assistants for Tribe ’62, who says he has retained a close relationship with them both.“He was very impressive, and did extremely well,” Tribe said. “As did his classmate, the president-elect.”“He’ll be a tremendous appointment to the FCC,” Tribe said, adding that Genachowski is a “person who has a really deep understanding of both traditional media regulation and of new technology.”Andrew H. Schapiro, who was a year above Obama and Genachowski on the Harvard Law Review, said he remembers that the two students played basketball together, and that Genachowski was sociable and well-liked. Schapiro has remained friends with both Law School graduates, and also worked on Obama’s campaign. “He’s extraordinarily creative, energetic, and sensible,” he said of Genachowski. “Julius is a terrific choice.”—Staff writer Noah S.

Alexander D. Wissner-Gross, a fellow at the University’s Center for Environment, found himself in the middle of an imbroglio this weekend when his study on the environmental impact of computing was used in an article by the Sunday Times—the British paper—to claim that two Google searches generate as much carbon dioxide as boiling a kettle for a cup of tea.Wissner-Gross later denied that this claim was included in his study, which he said was about web-usage in general, not Google in particular.Google is combating the Sunday Times’ article, which declared that “Google is secretive about its energy consumption and carbon footprint,” and that it “generates high levels of C02.” According to the publication, one Google search emits 7 grams of carbon dioxide—about half of the 15 grams discharged when boiling water in a kettle.Later that day, Google’s Senior Vice President of Operations Urs Hölzle quickly responded to the article with a post on the official Google blog. “One Google search is equivalent to about 0.2 grams of CO2,” he wrote. He added that a search uses “about the same amount of energy that your body burns in 10 seconds.”Google Spokesperson Jamie Yood said in an e-mail to The Crimson yesterday that “the claims made in this article and the calculations this ‘study’ makes are many times too high.” However in an article posted at TechNewsWorld.com  on Monday, Yood said that Google recognizes its environmental impact.“There’s an acknowledgment that Google is using energy, and on the business front it makes sense to get this energy cost as low as possible.” Wissner-Gross also repudiated the tea-kettle numbers used in the article. “I have no idea where they got those statistics,” Wissner-Gross said to the information technology Web site. “For some reason, in their story on the study, the Times had an axe to grind with Google.”He denied ever singling the company out in his study on the environmental impact of computing, which will be published by the U.S. Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.“Our work has nothing to do with Google. Our focus was exclusively on the Web overall, and we found that it takes on average about 20 milligrams of CO2 per second to visit a Web site,” Wissner-Gross said.But Wissner-Gross said that he was accurately quoted by the Sunday Times as saying that “a Google search has a definite environmental impact.”He added that “Google operates huge data centers around the world that consume a great deal of power.”The Sunday Times also claimed that the search engine consumes more energy than the average because it prioritizes speed over energy savings.“The system minimizes delays but raises energy consumption,” the Sunday Times wrote.However, Hölzle’s post on the Google blog argued that the search engine decreases the “reliance on car trips, pulp and paper” because, before the Internet, “answering a query meant traveling to the reference desk of your local library.” Hölzle added that “the average car driven for one kilometer (0.6 miles for those in the U.S.) produces as many greenhouse gases as a thousand Google searches.”Hölzle also claimed that Google has “designed and built the most energy efficient data centers in the world.”In October, Google reported that its Power Usage Effectiveness—a measure of power efficiency—had a quarterly average rating of 1.13, well below the Environmental Protection Agency’s reported average of 2.0 for data centers.Wissner-Gross speculated as to why the Sunday Times targeted Google. “It’s a really easy way to sell papers. Google is a very successful company and it’s a very easy way to get readership by making grandiose claims about them,” he said to TechNewsWorld.The Sunday Times also ran an article in 2007 that raised concerns about Google’s privacy standards.Wissner-Gross did not return The Crimson’s request for comment.—Staff writer Ellen X.

The Cambridge City Council passed a resolution on Monday calling for “an immediate end to all attacks on civilians on both sides” in the latest outpouring of violence between Israel and Palestine in the Gaza Strip. 
The resolution—which passed by a vote of eight to zero with one abstention—specifically urges the United States government to press for a cease-fire on both sides, an end to the economic blockade of the Gaza Strip, access for journalists, and access to humanitarian aid.
This resolution is not the first time that the council has expressed its views on conflicts and human rights in places outside of Cambridge.  
“Cambridge has always been a city that has been engaged in a world beyond its borders,” Vice-Mayor Brian P. Murphy ’86-’87 said. 
The policy order will be forwarded to President George W. Bush, President-elect Barack Obama, the Secretaries of State and Defense, the Secretaries-designate of State and Defense, and the Massachusetts Congressional Delegation.
Cambridge City Councillor Sam Seidel, who voted in favor of the resolution, said that the policy order was meant to indicate the need for a new direction regarding U.S. policy in the Middle East. 
“Overall the last administration’s response to the Israeli-Palestinian issue has been a complete failure,” Seidel said. “It has been a consistent failure, and has put the parties involved and the U.S. in a worse position.”
The current fighting in Gaza has lasted for more than two weeks, and has reportedly resulted in over 900 casualties, according to the Associated Press. 
“How could I not do something?” said City Councillor Marjorie C. Decker, who authored the resolution with Cambridge Mayor E. Denise Simmons and who has written other policy orders aimed at upholding human rights in the past. “To not say something feels very complicit.”  
With the change in federal administration imminent, Seidel said he was confident that the new administration will “respond to our resolution and will respond to the conflict with a great deal of energy and creativity and determination” although he added that whether Obama’s administration would be successful in bringing an end to the conflict “is not clear to me now.” 
On Oct. 29, 2007, the council passed a policy order in support of a bill in the state legislature that would use the Commonwealth’s pension fund investments “to promote democracy and human rights in Burma.”
On June 4, 2007, the council passed a statement in support of workers at a plant in North Carolina “in their struggle for dignity, fair wages and safe working conditions.”
Both of these policy orders were authored by Decker.

Dean of Freshman Thomas A. Dingman ’67 opened his home to 12 freshmen for a lesson in home cooking—sustainable, vegetarian cooking adapted from the Harvard University Dining Services menu. Over fifty students requested to participate in the free, limited-space class that was organized by the HUDS Food Literacy Project (FLP) and the Freshman Dean’s Office.HUDS Executive Chef Lawrence R. Kessel and Currier Chef Christopher Tighe demonstrated a variety of cooking techniques that featured ingredients used by dining hall chefs.The menu: delicata squash with browned butter and sage (Harvard consumed 44,000 pounds of squash this semester, according to Kessel), brown rice pancakes with a citrus salsa (dining halls usually serve the pancakes with soy sauce), a lentil dal with locally distributed curry powder, and a vegetable lasagna (the only menu item that is not available in HUDS dining halls).“Almost everything you saw we would probably serve in the dining hall,” Kessel said. He added that HUDS chooses menu items based on their seasonal availability. The citrus salsa, Kessel said, is in season during the winter months.“We really do want to teach people about food,” said Kessel, who also noted that HUDS chefs use student comment to develop the dining hall menus.“The epic response to this class kind of shows the interest,” said FLP Representative for the freshman class Maya S. Sugarman ’12. Slots for the class were taken within 10 minutes of the invitation e-mail being sent out to the Freshman class, Sugarman said.The lesson was intended to further the FLP’s goals of educating students on agriculture, nutrition, food preparation and community. Katherine W. Steele, director of freshman programming for the FDO added that it also served as a way to introduce students to the HUDS staff. “I don’t think people realize how experienced the chefs are,” Steele said.Kessel, who had his own restaurant for several years, and Tighe had both spent years working in the culinary industry before coming to Harvard. “They know so much about food and appreciate their cooking,” said Steele.Brooke E. McDowell ’12, one of the few freshmen lucky enough to attend, left the dean’s kitchen with more than just a full stomach. “It was nice to see behind the scenes,” she said. Dingman’s comfortable accommodations allowed for some hands-on assistance from a few courageous volunteers.The chefs demonstrated the “claw method” used to cut onions, which entails using the knuckle to protect the fingers and support the knife.McDowell said that she would not soon forget “getting scolded for my onion cutting.”She added, “I did not like the claw method.”—Staff writer Noah S.
