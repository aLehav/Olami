After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the 20 years since the release of “Spirited Away,” the film has remained beloved by fans not only for its delightful animation, but its unforgettable score. Joe Hisaishi’s soundtrack has stood the test of time, and features memorable leitmotifs that pair with the film's themes of courage and friendship. Immediately recognizable to audiences all over the world, Hisaishi's musical signatures bring a sense of cohesion and familiarity to director Hayao Miyazaki's otherworldly vision by creating their own kind of magic.
One such composition is the opening theme “One Summer’s Day,” which first plays as ten-year-old protagonist Chihiro Ogino clutches a bouquet of flowers during the drive to her new home. Synths and strings swirl around a piano line whose measured cadence seems indifferent to Chihiro’s petulant complaints. After her parents take a wrong turn, the tempo takes off along with the car, making jolts of brass and percussion feel like bumps in the road. This initial strand of music, which conveys the unpredictable turmoil of growing up, establishes Hisaishi's score as essential to the development of Miyazaki’s themes.
Fittingly, each subsequent appearance of the melody from “One Summer’s Day” highlights how Chihiro overcomes obstacles with others’ kindness and support. The next time we hear the theme, Chihiro’s close friend Haku is by her side — and instead of unraveling into jumpy chaos, the piano returns for a peaceful solo as sunlight streams into the room where Chihiro has fallen asleep.

This calm shatters with the arrival of No-Face, a mysterious spirit who shows where the film’s most serious threat really lies: not in any particular character, but in the greed many of them share. When that greed leads No-Face on a destructive rampage, Hisaishi's score adds another dimension to the film: Frantic passages overwhelm the previously unassuming background music, taking a powerful sonic stand against selfish materialism that imbues Chihiro’s attempts to save No-Face with ominous urgency.

Chihiro’s now-iconic train ride to meet Yubaba’s twin sister Zeniba is a scene that carries a loneliness too profound for words but well within reach of Hisaishi’s music. Silent spirits disembark one by one, leaving Chihiro surrounded by the pristine melancholy of “The Sixth Station,” whose layers of piano and strings overlap as gently as the soft ocean waves outside — but whose underlying harmonic tension between yearning and resignation bubbles to the surface in the absence of dialogue. You start to wonder how something composed to fill the silence somehow makes each shot feel so much emptier.

As Chihiro’s journey draws to an end, both the film’s plot and music explore the contradictions and nuances of memory. The main melody of “Reprise” doesn’t seem to reprise anything in particular at first, though its lilting waltz rhythm strikes a lovely balance between nostalgia and novelty. But the piece’s ending suddenly brings back a motif from “The Sixth Station,” replacing plaintive strings with triumphant fanfare as if to describe how revisiting the same memory from a new perspective can elicit so many different emotions.

I don’t really remember the first time I watched “Spirited Away” — but its soundtrack, just like the magical hair tie Chihiro receives in the spirit realm, will always be a connection to Miyazaki’s cinematic world, shining with the warmth of “One Summer’s Day.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The University’s new biological research and manufacturing facility appointed biotechnology industry veteran Ran Zheng as its inaugural Chief Executive Officer and began construction on a 40,000 square-foot facility in Watertown, Mass. on Thursday.
A public-private partnership led by Harvard and MIT, the center seeks to foster partnerships between academics, biopharma, and medical leaders to accelerate the production and delivery of new treatment technologies to patients. Previously known as the Massachusetts Center for Advanced Biological Innovation and Manufacturing since its formation in late 2019, it also received a new name on Thursday: Landmark Bio.
Landmark Bio began construction on its facility at the Arsenal on the Charles in Watertown on Thursday, where it plans to open offices and labs at the start of next year, according to a press release. It signed a lease on the facility in January after raising $76 million in funding.
Zheng — who has more than 25 years of leadership experience at major pharmaceutical companies including Amgen and most recently as Chief Technical Officer at Orchard Therapeutics — started her new position at Landmark Bio in March of this year.
In Thursday’s release, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 — who also serves as the chair of Landmark Bio’s board — said Zheng brings experience and expertise “at the perfect time” to her new role.
“As a leader with broad and deep industry expertise and an impressive record of achievement in technology development and global clinical development, Ran comes to this role at the perfect time,” Garber said.
He added that the start of construction of the facility is only the beginning of efforts to “innovate” and “support” the creation of biological therapies.
“The facility will ease key bottlenecks in the development of some of the most promising approaches to therapy today,” Garber said.
Led by Zheng, Landmark Bio plans to recruit more than 100 experts in emerging biotechnologies such as cancer immunotherapy and CRISPR/Cas9 editing.
“I am very excited to join the Landmark Bio team and collaborate with the extraordinary scientists, physicians and entrepreneurs who are in the forefront of biological innovation,” Zheng said in the release.
“We have a unique opportunity to harness the power of mission-driven collaboration and help turn today’s cutting-edge research into tomorrow’s breakthrough therapies and shape the future of human health,” she added.
The facility’s initial areas of focus will include cell and gene therapy, gene editing, and messenger RNA products — all promising biotechnologies with the potential to treat and cure life-threatening diseases such as cancer, Parkinson’s, and Alzheimer's. In particular, the use of mRNA in the clinical setting has come into the spotlight in the last year with the successful development of mRNA Covid-19 vaccines by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.
The center will house manufacturing space for clinical trial products, innovation and development labs, quality control services, and offices and meeting spaces, according to the release.
Landmark Bio will partner with several Harvard Medical School affiliates, including Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston Children’s Hospital, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, and Massachusetts General Hospital. The center will also collaborate with the state government through the Massachusetts Life Science Center.
In the release, Massachusetts Housing and Development Secretary Mike Kennealy said state leaders and Massachusetts Life Sciences Center are “committed” to supporting the center’s “immense potential” in innovation.
“The Commonwealth has long recognized the power of public-private partnerships to unlock new opportunities that create jobs, spur economic development, and strengthen burgeoning areas of our economy such as biomanufacturing,” Kennealy said.
“The Baker-Polito Administration and the Massachusetts Life Sciences Center are committed to ensuring we build a strong foundation for future growth and collaboration to advance the immense potential that this endeavor can contribute to the Massachusetts innovation ecosystem,” he added.
