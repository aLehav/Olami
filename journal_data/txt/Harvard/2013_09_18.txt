After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every fall television networks do the equivalent of throwing spaghetti at the wall to see what sticks by premiering dozens of new shows, hoping at least one of them is a hit that will make them millions in ad revenue. These are four of the most heavily promoted new shows of the fall—and our predictions on whether or not they'll live up to their hype.
“Brooklyn Nine-Nine”
The main appeal of FOX's new show “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” seems to be former “SNL” funnyman and “The Lonely Island” member Andy Samberg. Without him “Brooklyn” looks like a subpar zany comedy following a police investigation team that gets shaken up by the arrival of a new police chief played by Andre Braugher. The main saving graces of the trailer include office pranks, jokes about over-ambitious manscaping, and a hilarious cameo from fellow “SNL” alum Fred Armisen. The juxtaposition of Braugher's strict bad-cop style and the hapless antics of the police investigation team promise some chuckles, but it's unclear what will make this show stand out from the increasingly competitive fall lineups.
Premiered Tuesday, September 17.
“Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.”
Fans of “The Avengers” or Joss Whedon in general are sure to love this new TV adaptation of Marvel's S.H.I.E.L.D. characters. "It's not just spy vs. spy anymore," says Agent Coulson in the trailer for the show, "the whole world's in on the action." In a post-Snowden, post “Law and Order,” post-"NCIS” world, the show seems to be saying, reality is just not fantastic enough to be shocking or entertaining anymore. The series’ creator and “Avengers” director Joss Whedon carries through his signature action-hero and high-tech aesthetic to primetime. It's clear that Marvel has not skimped on visual effects to make this show stand up to the visual standard set by the feature film that inspired it.
Premieres Tuesday, September 24.
“Super Fun Night”
"Three nerdy female friends decide to have super fun every Friday night." That's one popular description for ABC's upcoming show—wait for it—"Super Fun Night." The show stars Rebel Wilson (“Bridesmaids,” “Pitch Perfect”) as Kimmie, Lauren Ash as Marika, and Liza Lapira as Helen-Alice. It promises to be another slapstick comedy set in New York following a group of 20-something misfits who have trouble living the glamorous lifestyle that TV has promised them always happens in New York. With Wilson’s considerable talents as a comedian, it’s a disappointment that “Super Fun Night” seems relatively brainless and derivative. The show aims to subvert the conventions of the typical “Young People in NYC” premise, but if you're looking for more intellectual substance or ingenuity, keep looking.
Premieres Wednesday, October 2.
“The Crazy Ones”
Comedy’s legendary wildcard Robin Williams is back—and he's starring in the aptly-titled CBS sitcom “The Crazy Ones.” He plays the part of an ad executive named Simon Roberts who leads a team of—surprise, surprise—comically inept subordinates. The show also stars Sarah Michelle Gellar as Williams' much more competent and high strung daughter, who also works in the advertising agency. The show promises to have plenty of Williams' trademark manic humor and a fair sprinkling of celebrity appearances (the pilot features Kelly Clarkson playing herself with Williams and his team trying to get her to record a jingle for McDonalds). Simon’s desperation is a launching pad for a series of gimmicks, and the show appears to straddle the line between realistic and ridiculous in a way that might actually be funny. It's unclear whether “The Crazy Ones” will be sold to the public with the same flair that its characters try to sell ads to major companies with, but with this cast and premise, it's worth giving it a shot—or, as Williams' character emphasizes in the preview, "leap and the net shall appear."
Premieres Thursday, September 26.

Holding her tray, wide-eyed Piper Chapman enters the prison lunchroom in her new orange jumpsuit, uncertain of where to sit. A nearby inmate tells her out of pity, “Go sit there, she’s a nice white lady,” and Piper, relieved, obeys. During this scene from the new Netflix dramedy series “Orange is the New Black,” one phrase comes to mind: one of these things is not like the other.
Taylor Schilling is amazingly genuine as the odd girl out at Litchfield Penitentiary, but her character is not exactly representative of the typical female convict. Piper Chapman, who riffs off a Pablo Neruda quote when trying to scare a juvenile offender, is not an average inmate for many reasons. (The poetic threat is, by the way, “I’m going to do to you what the spring does to cherry trees, but in a prison way.”)
“Orange is the New Black” is based on a true story, so the protagonist’s demographics are not merely artistic choices. The series loosely follows the story of Piper Kerman, a Smith College graduate and WASP who was sent to prison for money laundering and drug trafficking, crimes she committed when she was young and in love with a lesbian drug smuggler. The series is actually named after Kerman’s memoir, which describes her experience in prison.
Though “Orange is the New Black” follows the story of one incarcerated individual, its setting—an American prison—presents a sizable dilemma. How can a series strike a challenging balance between the story of a white, educated prisoner and reasonable representation of an American prison? The reality of racial, sexual, and economic diversity in prison could easily be eclipsed by the story of Piper Chapman, a self-described “nice blonde lady” with a loving fiance and an artisan soap business to run. This is not to say that the series should resemble a documentary, but for the sake of accuracy—and creating more opportunities for actors of color—“Orange is the New Black” has a lot to lose by focusing single-mindedly on Piper. The series has received critical praise for the diversity of its cast, but there are still other potential pitfalls as it heads into its second season.
Recently, the Aaron Sorkin series encountered a similar problem when “The Newsroom” depicted character Maggie Jordan—a wholesome, Midwestern girl with skin as white as milk—venturing to Africa and returning traumatized. As Willa Paskin wrote for Slate, “[W]e finally found out what happened in Africa, a huge, complicated continent that ‘The Newsroom’ portrayed as stereotypically as possible: a violent, tragic, traumatic place for blond girls just trying to do their best.” This critique illustrates the possible consequences of depicting the troubles of a plucky, sweet blonde woman without enough regard for context.
Series creator Jenji Kohan, most famous for creating the Showtime series “Weeds,” is no stranger to depicting white women in places they do not belong. “Weeds” followed the transformation of an unlikely candidate—the white, suburban mom Nancy Botwin—into a marijuana dealer. While the ethnic characters of “Weeds” received limited—or at least unflattering—screen time, the diverse characters of  “Orange is The New Black” have more complex roles. Piper may be a fish out of water, but she is a prisoner like the rest of the women at Litchfield. While Nancy Botwin was always somewhat distanced fro 
m the more diverse characters of “Weeds,” Piper is on more equal footing with the other inmates. On her first day at Litchfield, she cries to her fiance that she has only talked to white people, but she soon learns to navigate the racial dynamics of Litchfield. 
Kohan does not ignore race or treat the issue in a cautious, P.C. way, but instead unabashedly depicts the complexity of race relations at Litchfield. In the lighter moments of the series, the characters often employ equal-opportunity racism; no race is spared from humor. Some critics find Kohan's humor degrading rather than empowering, including Aura Bogado. In her article for the Nation, titled "White is the New White," she writes "If we’re addicted to Orange Is the New Black, then we’re strung out on the drug of spectacle—jonesing for hateful, racist images created by a white imagination for profit and fame." Though this artistic choice is less than sensitive, at times the humor allows the series to acknowledge race and racial stereotypes in a refreshing way. 
Though “Orange is the New Black” unsurprisingly devotes most of its screen time to Piper and how she landed up in Litchfield, Kohan successfully weaves the tales of Litchfield’s diverse inmates with Piper’s. Each episode features flashbacks of the other inmates’ backstories. Refreshingly, none of them are stereotypical sob stories but instead are imbued with Kohan’s characteristic whimsy. Though Piper gets most of the limelight, the other characters are portrayed with admirable depth.
This stylistic consistency also applies to the characters’ language. Piper is not the only character to employ quirky or literary references. Sophia, a black, transgender inmate and hairdresser, quips to the polite Piper, “‘Please’ is for commissary hoes and Oliver Twist.” Though Piper is a fish out of water, this stylistic consistency reinforces that she is not so special compared to the other inmates. As she tells her mother, she is here because she committed a crime and is no different from the other women at Litchfield. It is questionable if Piper’s statement is entirely accurate; very few of the inmates will return to such a cozy existence after they do their time. But it is true that even though Piper is the series’ protagonist, she is not the only character given the privilege of depth and authenticity.

At first, in the beginning of the first part of the fifth season, I understood how people still felt empathy and rooted for drug lord Walter White, or Heisenberg, in “Breaking Bad,” even after everything he had done. He still had that banter-filled, weird father-son relationship with his sidekick Jesse—that warmed your heart in a disturbing way. He was still whipping out some incredibly terrifying one-liners but was also impossible to fear in those tighty-whities. (Warning: spoilers ahead) And perhaps most importantly—warning, spoilers ahead—his murder of Gustavo Fring at the end of the fourth season could be argued to be an act of self-defense (if you temporarily forget about the whole child-poisoning thing). The death of adorable Gale, too—if you really wanted to still love Walter—could be seen as a desperate act of survival. But now, as the fifth and final season approaches its end, I deeply hate Walter White, and it constantly shocks me how many people still defend and love him. His badness used to be fun. Now it just makes me sick.
  
For me, the turning point was when Walt shot Mike Ehrmantraut, former hitman in Gustavo’s meth operation.  By that point, I was already disgusted by Walt’s reaction to the shooting of a child—that understandably rocked Jesse’s world— but when Walt kills Mike near the end of the first half of the season, we see no excuse for his actions. This was a crime of pride, a crime of utter cowardly shamefulness because Walt just could not accept that Mike never respected him or saw him as the boss. There was not even a sliver of a reason of self-defense that Walt could rely on this time, unlike in his past business-survival murders. This murder sent the cold blood that already lay latent in Walt’s body to go coursing violently through him, turning thought into evil actions, like when he orders the brutal executions of nine witnesses who could flip against him.
  
Now, in the second half of the fifth season, Walt has turned the focus of his evil manipulations and expert maneuvering not on drug dealers and cartel killers (for whom it is easy to feel less sympathy)—but on his own family. He blackmails Hank and Marie, who have always been kind and good to him. He lies like a slimy weasel to his own son, poor Walt Jr. who never suspects that his father tells him that his cancer is back not to warn him, but to guilt him into spending more time at home. Before Jesse learns the truth and turns to the DEA, Walt tries to kill Jesse with kindness, showing him some fatherly love to prevent any unwelcome hostility that he knows Jesse needs in order to stop [him from acting in a hostile way towards him. When Walt was fooling members of the meth world, I went along with him. Now that he’s devouring the innocent, it’s harder.
  
But people say, “He’s the hero of the show! You have to root for him!” This used to be true. But now, thanks to creator Vince Gilligan’s expert crafting, there are many new heroes to root for who are worth our time. I find myself saying, “Come on, Hank!” out loud when I watch “Breaking Bad” (usually alone in my room at night, with white knuckles and nail biting). Hank is a hero who has always proved himself to be steadfast and true. Although he can sometimes be a bit careless and has a hot temper, his true motives are noble and his heart is good. How can Walt still be the object of our hopes when Hank is right there, ready to put an end to his evil ways and bring an epic showdown? Jesse too, who is very difficult not to love, is a great character to cheer on. Yes, he’s made some terrible mistakes. He’s murdered and cooked meth too. But Jesse’s heart has always been weak rather than cold. Until now, he has not had the chance to stand up and fight for what he believes is right.
 
As Jesse tells Hank and Gomez, Walt is the devil. Let’s stop rooting for the devil and turn to the good side. Team Hank, Team Marie, and Team Jesse for the win.

“Don’t you want me, baby? Don’t you want me, ohh!” It’s a sunny Boston afternoon, and a crowd has gathered around a stage near Downtown Crossing in Boston, dancing and singing along to a famous ’80s synthpop hit. However, the men on stage with instruments in hand are less enthused than their audience. “We’re not that into doing covers,” confesses David Martineau, lead singer of Bearstronaut, after the show. “We’d rather work on our own songs and write new stuff.”
For the Boston-based Bearstronaut, there’s a constant tension between trying to push boundaries and please audiences at the same time. They are heavily rooted in an ’80s synth-based style of huge choruses and jittery keyboard licks, yet try to work around the fringes of the constricting genre. Recently, the tightrope walk has worked out: they played in front of energetic audiences all across the country this year on a tour that culminated with their homecoming dance at the Boston Calling music festival.
Bearstronaut’s roots are firmly set in New England. Many of the members attended high school together in Watertown, CT before convening for college at UMass Lowell in 2007. An early iteration of the band featured, as Mardsen described it,  “The Rapture-esque dance punk,” but the band’s sound shifted around when bassist Nate Mardsen joined the band—Martineau and Mardsen formed a bond, and probably not just due to the well-groomed mustaches they both currently sport. The result was an emphasis in keyboard-focused synth-pop that translated devastatingly well with local live audiences.
The band’s most recent EP, 2012’s “Paradice,” shows the band’s evolution and maturation. It’s a catchy five-song project with reverberating synth hooks galore; “Passenger Side” sounds like it belongs on a Toto album, as Mardsen’s springy bass balances out Martineau’s more relaxed vocals. And while Bearstronaut are known for their impressive live showmanship, this EP sounds distinctly like a studio-made project—although technically, it was made in the band’s Tufts-area apartment—with its careful contruction and editing.
“We completely changed the way we write songs,” Mardsen says. “We used to all write together in a rehearsal space, and but songs sounded a little too rock ‘n’ roll. So we started shaping songs for how we want them to be on the record, and then figuring out what to do with them live.”
The shift seems to pay off at the Sept. 5 Downtown Crossing Block Party, where the band play a set to kick off the festival weekend. The songs do not sound as full as they do on the record, but the band makes up for it with increased fervor. Mardsen leads the way—with his bass turned all the way up, he sets the tone for the band’s propulsive energy. They deftly flip between new songs and classic covers with ease: a “Paradice” cut turns into Fleetwood Mac’s “Dreams” and then back again, with the whole section driven by drummer Phil Boisvert’s furious hi-hat attack. On “Birds of Prey,” all four members grab a drum and pound away at polyrhythms.
Still, it wan’t hard to tell that the band’s thoughts lay in their mammoth upcoming performance at Boston Calling. “I have no idea what to expect. I really want to meet Kendrick [Lamar]! I need to hang out with him!” Mardsen laughingly says. Martineau is a little more sincere, acknowledging the size of the moment. “This is a big milestone for us,” he says. “To be able to show our friends and family that we’ve been working this hard for this long, it’s the fruits of our labor coming true.”
Sunday afternoon is a perfectly sunny day in Boston, and Bearstronaut take the stage in front of an impressively large crowd of early birds; it’s pretty clearly a local crowd. The band doesn’t disappoint, ripping through its set with aplomb. For the new single “Where I’ll Die,” Martineau hops around the stage and claps his hands emphatically. Mardsen can’t contain the huge grin on his face as he stomps his feet. The crowd claps along, throws up their hands, and roars in approval.
For larger acts like Lamar or Solange, Boston Calling was another pit stop. For Bearstronaut, the festival was a triumphant return home. “We’re taking a break after this,” Martineau says. “We’re going underground, and then we’re recording full-length album. We’re really excited to start from scratch.” Their Boston Calling performance was surely an apex for the group, but with any luck, Bearstronaut will continue to reach higher.

“If you build it, he will come,” says a voice at the beginning of the 1989 movie “Field of Dreams.” Kevin Costner’s character, an Iowa farmer, interprets the message as a command to build a baseball diamond in his cornfield. “People will come, Ray,” James Earl Jones reassures him later. “They’ll come to Iowa for reasons they can’t even fathom.” Ray builds the field and—indeed—people come.
Harvard administrators, it seems, thought the same logic would apply when they built the Student Organization Center at Hilles in the Radcliffe Quad. They forgot, however, the three rules of real estate: location, location, location. The enigmatic allure of America’s pastime may have drawn people to the cornfields of the Midwest. But the out-of-the-way SOCH, though designed and well equipped for work and leisure, is no match for the gravity of the Yard and River.
Yet there is cause for hope for the many who consider Harvard’s existing social space inadequate. According to University President Drew G. Faust, an anonymous donation made to The Harvard Campaign will fund the development of a new campus center. Reports from last year identified the Holyoke Center as a likely candidate for the site of the facility, which Faust suggested would be designed to accommodate parties, lectures, and more. If this preliminary account is to be believed, the center should be a real boon to campus life.
The plan’s architects should proceed with students’ interests in mind—particularly, we hope, those of undergraduates (even if the center is, as Faust was careful to convey, a University-wide initiative). But if the Lamont and Greenhouse Cafés are any indication, refreshments and a place to rest one’s rear end may be all that are required to foster an environment in which students can converse, work on homework, and refuel (with sandwiches, we hope; to displace Al’s would be an unprecedented act of cruelty). Add in the things that people like about Harvard’s existing but underutilized social spaces—perhaps the wide-screen televisions of the SOCH, or the stylish couches of the Northwest Labs basement—and you’ve a recipe for a place where students feel part of a social and physical community.
We applaud the University’s effective and creative use of outdoor common spaces such as the Science Center Plaza. But with New England’s winters often nasty, brutish, and long, these spaces’ capacity for cultivating and sustaining community is limited to the bookends of the academic year. If anything, the warm-weather success of the Science Center Plaza is evidence that a centrally located, smartly planned, and well-executed social space will bring people together.
The anonymous benefactor has loaded the bases for this new campus center; now it’s up to Harvard to hit one out of the park. We are confident that if Faust and the administration build it—this time, strategically—people will come.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two years ago, I left home to begin college life; 36 hours later I found myself snuggled up against nine restless strangers under a tarp on the First-Year Outdoor Program. I was linked to these people only by our newbie status at Harvard and our random placement on this particular FOP trip; yet in only five days, we had become a family.
I have been on four subsequent trips with FOP—each unique and foundational to how I will remember my time in college. But no matter how hard I try, I am unable to replicate the magic of a FOP trip back on campus. As we all embark on a new year of school, I have been thinking: What is it about FOP that is so meaningful, and why do we confine this incredible intimacy and fulfillment to pre-orientation time?
William Cronon, an influential environmental historian, writes in an essay entitled “The Trouble with Wilderness” of our tendency to define wilderness narrowly: It is not here, but out there. Wilderness evokes pristine lands untouched by humankind, towering palisades, raging waterfalls, majestic mountains. For Cronon, the trouble is that an understanding of wilderness that precludes the settings of our day-to-day lives excludes us from appreciating and protecting the here and now.
A similar trouble exists within ourselves—a discrepancy between how we live and feel out in the woods and how we live and feel during the rest of our time at Harvard. When we go out into the woods with nine other strangers for companionship and nothing to do but hike, build tarps, and eat peanut butter, we become the most sublime versions of ourselves—our majestic mountain selves, so to speak. But back on campus, as work piles up, commitments accumulate, and we feel ourselves being tugged in 10 million directions, we stop appreciating and protecting the majestic mountain versions of ourselves.
On FOP, each hike brings a conversation with someone new until we know every single person in the group. It takes place over only several days, but the “knowing” is real. It’s not the Annenberg trifecta—Name? Dorm? Hometown?—but rather, “Tell me about something that you love”; “When was the first time you felt like an adult?” and “What scares you about leaving home?” Our relationships on trail have depth, whereas during the semester, all too often, it is width we are after. That’s what networking is, after all— widening our circles. But in the woods, we invest.
On FOP, we take chances with our relationships, sharing things that we never thought we’d tell people who we met three days ago. And the people in whom we are confiding are people who we never thought would be our friends. Although these people are very different from ourselves, we are not afraid to ask them for help when we need it. Our strength comes from togetherness. And in togetherness, we are able to be completely present. A vibrating cell phone becomes a faint memory, an inbox brimming with unread messages a cruel illusion.
But back on campus, our aversion to vulnerability and burdensomeness prevents us from asking for help and deeply connecting with our amazing peers. The forces of the universe conspire against us being truly present. It is near impossible to focus all of our faculties on one person or task. We follow our G Cals around like robots. We arrive at a meeting only to begin thinking about the next one. We buy shoes online during lecture. We dine with iPhone-dazed blockmates.
Cronon is right. We can’t just think of the wilderness as something that is out there. It is right here, too. The spirit of FOP need not be squandered come September 1. We can extend the mindset that is found so easily out in the woods into our lives all year on campus. If we commit to it and work thoughtfully to build supportive communities, our best, happiest selves can be cultivated and nurtured here at Harvard.
Today, the freedom of summer is still in our eyes, and the spirit of “Camp Harvard” is in the air. But as problem sets get tougher, paper due dates approach, and our planners become fuller and fuller, I am afraid we will forget about all of these things that make our time out in the woods on FOP the best part of college. But we don’t have to. So with intentionality, I challenge us all to work this year to throw our energy into relationships with new people, share pieces of our authentic selves with others, reach out to people who are very different, ask for help, and strive to be completely present where we are.
Whether you went on FOP or not, love the outdoors or hate them, will graduate this year or in four, we all can choose to be the majestic mountain in Harvard Yard.

Internet generation, we need to talk. This National Security Agency problem is your problem. These recent NSA leaks are your leaks. Think about it. Who uses digital communications the most? Who visits the most websites? Who texts the most, chats the most, and tweets the most? It’s not your parents, and it’s definitely not your grandparents. No, the answer is inarguably you. You do those things; you rely on them; you live through them. You are the internet community; sorry older folks, but you’re just the guests (though you shouldn’t put up with this either). So for Christ’s sake my fellow Millennials, wake up!
For those of you who have not been following the news much over the summer, this May an NSA contractor named Edward Snowden took it upon himself to leak a massive amount of confidential documents to the Guardian. He claimed to have done so to spark public dialogue on the matter of ever-expanding U.S. surveillance, and sparked it he has. Last Friday, Harvard Law School’s own Yochai Benkler opined on the issue, declaring in a Guardian op-ed that, with the NSA, “anything short of root-and-branch reconstruction will be serving weak tea to a patient with a debilitating auto-immune disease.” Benkler came to this conclusion after explaining that, as revealed by Snowden’s leaks, U.S. intelligence has lied to both Congress and the courts on matters of surveillance, all while continually expanding its own power to digitally spy on post-9/11 America. The NSA’s systematic overreach and apparent disregard for privacy, again exposed primarily by Snowden’s whistleblowing, has even gotten the Director of National Intelligence James Clapper to acknowledge the need for public discussion. And alongside Clapper is Dennis Saylor, a federal judge who works in overseeing the NSA and who now argues for the official declassification of certain court rulings related to the surveillance debate.
What led Snowden to disclose what he did, what led him to go against the most powerful government on Earth, is the simple fact that the NSA is spying on us, and is doing so on a chillingly vast scale. Maybe, as they insist, they are not directly spying on us, so much as collecting virtually all of our online data and storing it in bulk for potential spying later. But that still should make most any internet user uncomfortable. In fact, it should make them outraged.
This brings me back to my fellow younger Americans. You’ve grown up with the internet, developed alongside it, and stored a significant amount of your lives on it. And now you know that they, the NSA, are collecting your stuff, your information—not rightfully theirs, but rightfully yours. If any generation should be most offended and threatened by this massive privacy breach, it should thus be your own. Maybe if the NSA were opening all snail mail, photocopying the contents within, and then sending it on its way, maybe then the major responsibility for outrage and action would be placed on the more aged groups of our population. But that’s not what the NSA is doing—or it is, but it is not doing it to physical letters; it is doing it to digital ones. And that, again, is young folks' territory.
So get mad. Over the summer, through the Guardian’s continued publication of the leaks, Snowden has been telling you (and is still telling you, as the leaks have yet to dry up) that virtually everything you do and say in the digital world is being collected and stored. And it’s happening for no reason. Well, you are told it’s happening to fight terrorists, to protect Americans and the like. But last I checked you are not terrorists. In fact, you’re not even suspected terrorists. And so just as you would not accept the police bursting into your home and photographing all of its contents without a warrant, you should not accept this. There really is no difference between the two, except that one is much less visible because it is much more digital. In both instances, though, you are having your privacy squashed in the name of your safety, a compromise you should never accept. Would the police, in such hypothetical, warrantless home photo shoots, probably catch some dangerous criminals? Of course they would. They’d collect and store photos of meth labs and dog fighting rings and more. But would you think that justified their weekly entry into your home, again without a warrant, to sift through all your possessions? Of course you wouldn’t. You would say that’s what warrants are for; that’s why we have courts and the rule of law and the Constitution. You would tell them to get the hell out of your home because they had no right to be there, and you would be right.
Well, you need to do the same for your digital home, because the NSA is invading that one. So defend your digital privacy, internet generation, because it’s your world that’s most threatened by these abuses, not your parents’.

Emptiness is a virtue.
Usually when something is empty, we think of it as a missed opportunity. An untrustworthy person has either an empty heart or an empty wallet. Horror movies are filled with empty hallways and empty acting. And John Harvard is a product, at least in part, of empty bladders.
But the day on which I am writing this is Yom Kippur. Even though I’m agnostic, I still fast. There is no real reason why, except for maybe something akin to the masochism that Harvard College Munch provides information about. And yet, as I’m realizing after writing that sentence how much I really want to munch on things and how “munch” I…damnit. Let me just get to the point.
Today, on an empty stomach, performing an empty gesture, with an empty mind incapable of thought beyond food, I di­d something that I’ve been doing a lot now—looking at nothing. As a sophomore, I’m a new resident of Winthrop House, with a room that overlooks a beautiful courtyard of grass, shade, and benches that remain eternally unoccupied. It is like being in the Yard during winter—except instead of looking like the aftermath of a war between campus services and campus services, it’s nice. The sunlight passes over the river and through the trees, enlivening the grass below and painting it with different shades of life. That is, until the sun goes down, when I can finally eat again.
Even with my tired mind and empty stomach, the courtyard is a manageable piece of art—one that I can feel comfortable staring at, even as it is being made and changed. And I’ve realized that it’s a symbol for a change I’ve seen in myself and other sophomores who have moved to a House this year—a change that allows us to find the true substance and value of the emptiness missing from Harvard’s freshman year.
As we all know, freshman year starts with Convocation: a welcoming of the new class, during which the president of the University calls everyone failures. Or at least, she wants them to fail.
“Don’t cling to the familiar,” said Faust during Convocation this month. “Let the next four years be spent learning how to fail, or at least how to be imperfect.”
“The path to knowledge is humility,” she continued. “Be comfortable with being uncomfortable.” The idea is to make enough mistakes and do enough during your years here to come up with a good answer to the question Erin D. Drake ’14 posed in her convocation speech: “What are you going to do with the privilege of attending Harvard College?”
The thing is, though, I don’t like failing. And I have a feeling the 5.8 percent admitted, 65 percent virginal Class of 2017 doesn’t either. But still, urged on by the president and others, we go out and try to fail for the rest of the year—and I personally was pretty successful at it.
I signed up for every activity, got on just enough email lists to make me ignore all my emails, and felt guilty that I didn’t do enough. I tried not just to fail, but to fail epically. And often, I felt a new pressure I had never felt before—at any moment, I was either failing at being the “ultimate freshman failure” or, even worse, succeeding at it, which meant I was failing (feel free to reread that weird sentence, in case its meaning failed you the first time).
The advice of the administration, the success of my peers, and even the tourists who took pictures of my home, all became pressures. They asked, “What are you going to do with the privilege of attending Harvard College?” I needed to find an answer.
The results were pretty easy to see. I felt guilty a lot. My time back at home started to seem more valuable than my time at school. And the op-eds I wrote for The Crimson were all mostly geared to the theme of calming down, like I was calming myself down.
Maybe it’s loopiness from hunger. But I feel like something really is different this time. The meaningless beginning-of-the-year questions have gone from “What dorm are you in? Where are you from? What are you thinking about studying?”  to simply “How was your summer?” And the view out my window has gone from the Yard to a yard, in a House I can identify with and an identity I’ve already formed, in a familiar place rather than a new one, and in a time I’ve given to myself rather than a “precious” time that was given to me.
Students come here because they know how to explore new interests. They know what they’ve already accomplished. And they are willing not only to shape themselves, but also to be themselves, without the pressure of outside forces. So, after a year of self-conscious searching, I want to finally answer the question.
“What are you going to do with the privilege of attending Harvard College?”
Sit by this window, staring outwards and observing, while trying to appreciate the quality of the emptiness around me in this column. In other words, I’m going to try to fail at failing.
That’s strange. I guess that means I’m trying to succeed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
A new Harvard study of a Native American’s eighteenth-century Latin poem reveals new details about colonial-era education at Harvard and substantiates otherwise unconfirmed accounts of the academic success of Benjamin Larnell, the last Native American student in Harvard’s colonial era.
“I was certainly a little bit surprised because when you think of someone writing a Latin poem, you don’t normally think of an American Indian teenager in the early 1700s,” said Thomas J. Keeline, a Classics graduate student at Harvard and co-author of the study. “This is a window into the colonial classroom. You can see the theory and application of colonial education, and that is pretty neat.”  
 The study began after Stuart M. McManus, a Harvard Ph.D. student in history, found a poem by an author whose name he did not recognize in the archives of Latin works at the Massachusetts Historical Society last year. 
 McManus discovered that Larnell, the last Native American student at Harvard during the colonial era, studied at the Boston Latin School and Harvard’s Indian College, where he became expertly-versed in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew.  
Keeline explained that Larnell’s poem, entitled “The Fox and the Weasel,” is a versification of one of Aesop’s fables.  “The poem is a school assignment, and the story is a fairly difficult moralistic tale,” he added.
The poem comments on class conflict employing the stylistic devices and vocabulary of Horace and Vergil. In the verse, a fox enters a crack in the wall of a granary, eats the grain, and ultimately finds that he is too big to come back out of the crack. A weasel informs the fox that he has to go back out as thin as he was when he entered.
McManus said he believes that the poem is evidence of how then-University President John Leverett, a 1680 graduate of the College, described Larnell as “an acute grammarian, an extraordinary Latin poet, and a good Greek one.”
“We now have evidence that actually quantifies how good he was at a certain stage. We can thus draw some conclusions about how good he became while he was at Harvard,” McManus said.
Reactions to the discovery of the poem have been enthusiastic. Keeline explained that the finding supports previous understandings of Native American education at Harvard.
 “What was remarkable to me was that Larnell, whose native language wasn’t even an Indo-European language, was educated in the same way that someone would have been educated in England at the time.” 
Kenard G. Dillon ’17, a member of Harvard’s Native American community, also said he believed that the discovery was significant. “You don't hear much about the Indian College, and any new information on the history of it is welcome.” 
Larnell’s poem represents a larger trend of cultural and social themes in the colonial period, as well as the legacy of Harvard’s Indian College, students said.
“It’s a testament to our ability to adapt as cultures,” commented prospective history concentrator Lauren R. Mandaville ’17.
With respect to the Indian College, Dillon explained, “It had a lasting impact that influenced Harvard’s current efforts to recruit talented Native American students.”

While most would list Columbus Day as the closest fall holiday, a select number of students and faculty at Harvard Law School yesterday were already celebrating a different historical event—the 226th anniversary of the signing of the Constitution on Sept. 17, 1787.
Ignored by most calendars and barely acknowledged on the White House website, Constitution Day was established in 2004. In accordance with the bill’s stipulation that all schools with federal funding offer educational programming about the document on Sept. 17, HLS professor Michael J. Klarman gave a lecture Tuesday entitled “Not Written in Stone” to a packed audience in HLS’ Adams Hall.
Sponsored by HLS’ branch of the American Constitution Society, the talk focused on the complicated origins of the Constitution and the challenge of adapting the document to new political climates since its ratification.
Klarman, who specializes in constitutional law and history, first sought to dispel the notion that the founding fathers convened in Philadelphia out of an urgent desire for equality.
Instead, Klarman said, the framers were afraid of future popular unrest and thought the Constitution might maintain order. He also questioned whether the ratification process was truly democratic. “The framers often stifled robust debate about the Constitution and pushed quick ratification votes in the states,” he said. “Considering that the majority in many states, especially in the South, opposed ratification, there was a democratic deficit in this process.”
However, Klarman also suggested that despite the cumbersome process of making amendments, the founding fathers did not wish to design a Constitution set in stone for eternity. “I think almost all of them would have been shocked that 225 years later, we still basically have the same Constitution,” he said.
While the Constitution may not have changed considerably since its signing, Klarman did note that the Supreme Court’s reading of the Constitution has frequently been influenced by public opinion and that “the people of the United States decide the course of the country, and not the courts.”
This is the third Constitution Day lecture Klarman has given for the ACS. Sophia Kim, president of the HLS ACS chapter, emphasized the importance of civic education about the Constitution and provided free copies of the document to audience members. “Everyone should read the Constitution,” she said. “It’s incredibly important to know your rights and the underlying foundation of our government.”
While those in attendance became better versed in the Constitution’s history, many students had no idea Tuesday was a national holiday.
“Oh, really?” said Alexa M. Oord ’17 when told about Constitution Day. “Well, that’s cool.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While the influence of racial bias on patients choosing healthcare providers might be socially problematic, a number of healthcare providers at Harvard Law School Tuesday afternoon asserted that respecting such personal preferences could nevertheless be the key to improving medical care.
Over brown-bag lunches, law students and faculty discussed the widely practiced phenomenon of allowing patients to choose their own doctors and nurses based on race. Associate Professor of Law at Fordham Law School Kimani Paul-Emile led the conversation by discussing her article “Patients’ Racial Preferences and the Medical Culture of Accommodation,” published in the UCLA Law Review.
While discrimination against patients has never been accepted in the medical profession, patient discrimination against doctors has often passed uncriticized. Some doctors, Paul-Emile explained, have an ethical obligation to ignore patient discrimination as secondary to providing proper medical care. Others, afraid of legal ramifications, are willing to allow patients to choose other doctors if they so desire.
Although Paul-Emile acknowledged that rejecting doctors based on race is “deeply troubling,” she also shared findings from her own research suggesting that racial concordance—when the physician and patient both identify as the same race—can actually enhance medical care.
“It seems that physician-patient race concordance confers significant health benefits for the patient, including more participatory decision-making and more patient trust,” she said. “Respecting patients’ requests for physicians may in fact be the key to improving care.”
Fidencio Saldana, instructor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, agreed that patients’ personal preferences were critical to effective care but suggested that these preferences did not always map over racial bias. He asked a few law students and faculty what it took to be a good doctor, and received responses ranging from “skill” to “trust and efficacy.” Neglecting any of these preferred traits, Saldana said, could break down a crucial relationship between physician and patient.
Renee M. Landers, professor of law at Suffolk Law School, suggested that maximizing diversity at medical schools could be one way to avoid racial bias in patient preferences.
“Numbers don’t tell the whole story of who should be in the medical profession,” she explained, pointing to a 21 percent gap between minorities in medical schools and minorities in the population.
“Diversity is a real means to achieve a core medical outcome,” she said.
Paul-Emile agreed that patients might be more likely to trust their physicians—regardless of race—if doctors were more open and diverse. “A long-term means of addressing this is by expanding cultural awareness among physicians, a means of encouraging tolerance and understanding among healthcare providers,” she said.

A group of workers, students, and union members gathered at the Harvard Club of Boston late Tuesday afternoon to raise awareness among Harvard alumni about the planned cuts of 31 custodial contract jobs at Harvard Medical School.
Tuesday’s protest, which came as part of an ongoing effort to speak out against the cuts, drew approximately 15 people, according to Eliza Sparkes, a communications specialist for the Service Employees International Union 32BJ District 615. Sparkes previously worked for SEIU Local 615, which merged with SEIU 32BJ over the summer.
In a gathering that Sparkes described as “more of a leafleting and delegation” than a rally, the group distributed flyers about the cuts, and also left a letter for the general manager of the Harvard Club of Boston describing their complaints. “Our presence was definitely known,” Sparkes said.
The cuts come as a result of the Medical School’s decision to cancel its contract with American Cleaning Company, Inc., a Brighton-based subcontractor that contracts the 31 custodial workers. Harvard notified the company of the decision in June. Richard M. Shea, the Medical School’s associate dean for campus planning and facilities, has cited the Medical School’s “high operating deficit” as reasoning behind the cuts, which are anticipated to save up to $1 million for the Medical School.
“We respect the right for people to protest,” Shea said in a phone interview on Tuesday evening. “But our position really hasn’t changed. We’re really trying to offset a pretty significant deficit at the Medical School, and we felt that cancelling this contract, among many other initiatives, helps us get back on track and help preserve the mission of the School.”
Shea said that, in an effort to address the deficit, the Medical School is trying to “engage our whole community on what changes we can make to our operating model.” He cited energy conservation efforts, among others, as an example. He also emphasized that the Medical School’s custodial workers who are hired directly by the School will keep their jobs with the contract’s cancellation.
Still, workers, union members, and others in the community have raised concerns about the planned cuts. Online and paper petitions protesting the cuts circulated throughout the summer, and dozens of people attended two rallies at the end of July opposing the cuts. Also in July, the Cambridge City Council approved a resolution “condemning” the decision.
The cuts were expected to take place on Aug. 17 and then were later delayed to September. Shea said on Tuesday that the Medical School is still working out the details of when the actual cuts will take place; he said that the School hopes to finalize the plans sometime this fall, and that it will probably be sometime in October.
Sparkes said that the opposition to the cuts will continue if the Medical School moves forward with its decision.
“As long as the layoffs are still on the table, then we’re going to continue to have actions and make our presence felt and reach out to all members of the Harvard community to ask them for their support to stop these layoffs because we just don’t think that they’re necessary,” Sparkes said.

CORRECTION: Sept. 18, 2013
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the name of the union that joined other protesters at the Harvard Club of Boston on Tuesday. In fact, the union is called Service Employees International Union 32BJ District 615 following the merger of SEIU Local 615 and SEIU 32BJ this past summer.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Environmental activist Bill E. McKibben ’82 called on hundreds of audience members in Sanders Theater to join “the fight” against the fossil fuel industry on Tuesday.
“You all will spend the rest of your lives dealing with the effects of climate change,” McKibben told the audience. “There’s a real stake in acting now.”
McKibben, who in 2007 founded a grassroots environmental organization with seven Middlebury undergraduates, argued that everyone can take action to create political change. In the lecture, he especially targeted large fossil fuel companies like ExxonMobil.
“Learning isn’t sufficient,” said McKibben, a former Crimson president. “We’ve won the argument scientifically. This can’t actually be solved by one light bulb at a time.”
McKibben said he knew his organization did not have the resources or financial power to outspend powerful companies, but it could still weaken them by encouraging institutions to divest.
350.org, McKibben’s organization, has coordinated 20,000 demonstrations in more than 180 countries. The organization draws its name from a statement that NASA’s James Hansen made in 2007, which said that 350 parts per million is the threshold for safe quantities of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
“I thought environmentalism was something rich white people do,” McKibben said, sharing photographic images of 350.org’s diverse global campaign. Instead, McKibben said people across the world—from Afghanistan to the Congo—have vested environmental interests.
McKibben’s stature among environmental activists stems from his 1989 book entitled “The End of Nature.” He described it as “the first book for a general audience about climate change.” His interest in divestment draws inspiration from similar efforts that encouraged American institutions to stop investing in South Africa in the mid-1980s.
According to McKibben, today the stakes are high.
“Physics is well ahead of us,” he said.
McKibben noted that in the past 40 years, 80 percent of the ice in the world’s oceans has melted. He also pointed to current events, such as the record-breaking rainfall in Colorado last week and the recent typhoon in Japan, to illustrate the consequences of climate change.
Audience member Jean Bonney said she and her husband agreed “one hundred and fifty thousand percent” with McKibben.
“We taught about global climate change long before it became well known,” Bonney said.
The lecture, titled “Oil and Honey” after his latest book, was hosted by the Harvard Institute of Learning in Retirement.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Matthew B. Platt, the assistant professor whose spring 2012 course Government 1310: “Introduction to Congress” was at the center of what is believed to be the largest cheating case in Harvard’s history, has not been promoted to associate professor after a routine tenure-track review, a senior member of the Government Department confirmed Tuesday.
Platt, whose scholarship concerns racial issues surrounding political agenda setting, will remain in the department until the end of the academic year when his current appointment expires, according to the source. Typically, assistant professors who are not offered promotion are given a year or more to search for a position outside of the Harvard tenure track before being forced to leave the University, in accordance with the normal procedures of the tenure track.
The source, who, like all tenured members of a given department, is involved in internal reviews of junior faculty as they seek promotion, requested anonymity due to the confidential nature of personnel decisions.
It is unclear whether the decision to remove Platt from the tenure track is connected to his involvement in the Government 1310 case, in which about 125 undergraduates were investigated and dozens punished for allegations of cheating on Platt’s take-home final exam. Tenure-track reviews are typically based on a candidate’s scholarly work and teaching ability, with the former receiving slightly more weight in decision-making.
The New York Times first reported that Platt was not given a promotion on Monday.
Platt did not respond to repeated requests for comment on the decision on Tuesday, and several members of the Government Department involved in the review declined to comment. Jeff Neal, a Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson, also declined to comment.
“We cannot comment on the grounds for this decision, which under Harvard University policy about personnel matters remain strictly confidential,” the senior Government Department member told The Crimson.
The senior professor would not specify when the promotion review occurred, though traditionally assistant professors are put up for promotion in the fourth or fifth year of their appointment. If they gain the support of their department and of the FAS-wide Committee on Appointments and Promotions, assistant professors are then promoted to associate professors and continue on the tenure track.
 
Platt is entering his sixth year as an assistant professor, meaning that if the traditional timing for tenure decisions adhered in his case, he would have been up for promotion review during either the 2011-2012 or 2012-2013 academic year.
 
Platt and his spring 2012 offering of Government 1310 were launched into the national spotlight at the end of August 2012, when Harvard took the unusual step of publicly announcing its investigation into an incident of widespread cheating that Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris called “unprecedented in anyone’s living memory.” Students were accused of inappropriately collaborating or copying answers, but many said in media reports that teaching fellows encouraged them to work together.
In the months following the announcement, nearly half of the 279 students enrolled in the course were investigated by the Administrative Board and roughly 70 were forced to temporarily withdraw from the College. While the adjudication of those cases took place behind closed doors throughout the fall semester, periodic breaches of confidentiality kept the case—and a number of undergraduate athletes under investigation—in the news.
But as his course and former students came under close scrutiny and other faculty members throughout FAS modified their own courses, Platt remained quiet. He did not teach any courses as the scandal unfolded in fall 2012, and his scheduled offering of Government 1310 this past spring was cancelled. He did, however, teach an undergraduate government seminar in the spring, which enrolled just three students and was not listed among other course evaluations in the Q Guide. As the case unfolded, he repeatedly declined requests for comment or interviews with The Crimson and other news outlets.
Platt arrived at Harvard in August 2008, the same month he earned a Ph.D. in political science from the University of Rochester. He wrote his dissertation on the evolution of agenda setting in the black political community after World War II. In his first semester at Harvard, he taught a small seminar in the Government Department on race and representation in Congress, a dominant thread in Platt’s research and teaching.
 
When Platt first taught Government 1310 in spring 2010, students who evaluated the course on the Q Guide gave the course, and Platt, reviews near the average for the social sciences. Student reviews praised Platt for his effective lectures and his accessibility outside the classroom, but they also noted that it was not a particularly difficult class.
The consistently well-enrolled course, which Platt taught again the following year, also gained a reputation for its lack of difficulty and its collaborative atmosphere; the reading assignments were usually fewer than 100 pages a week, and participation was not graded. Students’ grades were calculated solely based on their scores on four equally weighted take-home essay exams.
As Platt prepared to teach the course for a third time in spring 2012, however, he introduced a major change to the syllabus. Platt would still grade students exclusively on their take-home exam scores, but he altered the format of the tests, using more short-answer and multi-part questions, many of which were less open-ended than the prompts of the previous format. Even before the cheating investigation was announced, students reacted harshly to the change, criticizing the class in their Q Guide reviews submitted at the end of spring 2012. The course’s overall Q Guide rating also fell to 2.67 out of 5 possible points, far below the previous year’s figure of 3.57 and the average among social sciences courses, 3.93.
The announcement of the scandal caused ripples that lasted throughout the last academic year. Professors emphasized collaboration policies on their syllabi, the Committee on Academic Integrity proposed the College’s first-ever honor code, and administrators held town-hall meetings soliciting student feedback on the academic culture at Harvard.
Now, with the students forced to take last year off for their involvement in the case back on campus, Platt is not teaching this semester. He is, however, scheduled to teach two spring government seminars—one for undergraduates and another for graduate students—which are expected to be his last at Harvard.
 He says on his website that at the moment, “most of my time” is spent working on a book examining black congressional leaders and policy since Reconstruction, currently titled “From Trailblazers to Tokens.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When freshman forward Ashi Geberkidane arrived on campus in August, he wasn’t planning on playing soccer.
As a high school senior, Geberkidane began running cross country. His prowess for the sport was immediately recognized and rewarded. He was named to the All-Colorado running team and, as the Colorado 5A state cross country champion, Geberkidane was recruited to run for Harvard.
But Geberkidane, a member of the ESPN high school boys’ soccer Colorado All-Star team as a junior, wasn’t quite ready to give up his favorite sport.
 
“I just had to follow my heart,” Geberkidane said. “I have a passion for the game. I spoke to both [the cross country and soccer] coaches and decided to play soccer this fall. I love the team. We’re a family and we all know it. The best part of my day is going into the locker room and hanging out with those guys.”
After Pieter Lehrer was hired as the men’s soccer coach last April, Geberkidane contacted him, hoping he could play for Harvard. He joined the Crimson and quickly learned that he could contribute on the pitch.
Lehrer said that he recognizes Geberkidane’s contributions to the team thus far and appreciates the confidence the freshman demonstrates on and off the field.
“He’s got a very strong will in his mind and he brings that to the team as a freshman,” Lehrer said. “When he plays, he demands quality out of himself and everyone around him, and you can see why he’s so successful. He’s very good at fighting and really competing down to the last moment.”
With several injured players, Geberkidane and the five other freshmen were quickly called upon this season to help lead a team that went 3-11-3 overall last year. The freshman has started in the first four games of the season, scoring one of the team’s two goals.
“We have tremendous faith in our freshmen,” sophomore midfielder Michael Klain said. “We’ve looked to help them as much as we can by giving them a clear picture of what we need them to do. We don’t feel like because someone’s a freshman or a senior, one has to contribute more than the other; it’s just who’s going to succeed in playing their role on the field, and who’s going to help us move forward as a group.”
Senior midfielder Kevin Harrington said that he also recognizes the level of competition the freshmen create on the practice and game fields, hoping to earn some playing time and pushing the team’s starters to be better in the process.
“The freshmen have really been asked to step up and get the job done with no experience,” Harrington said. “They’ve been huge. It’s pretty impressive what they’ve done, taking on the roles of guys who are sidelined with injuries. We’ve got three [freshmen] on the field at any given time, and that’s way more than most Division I teams out there. They’ve been a huge influence on our team.”
Lehrer attributes this level of success to the support of the upperclassmen on and off the field as well, helping the freshmen feel like true members of the team off the bat.
“Typically the freshmen don’t contribute that quickly, but I think it’s a testament to the upperclassmen and their commitment to making sure that the freshmen are comfortable,” Lehrer said. “They want them to have a good understanding of what’s expected as a student-athlete here at Harvard…. They welcomed them on campus, and therefore the players felt very confident in their abilities to play and were ready from the get go.”
Despite a slow start to the season with a current 0-3-1 record, the team is confident in its ability to compete in conference play, noting the Crimson’s improvement since the season’s start.
“Coach is looking for continuous improvement,” Harrington said. “[He wants] us to hit our peak going into the Ivy League season. He’s satisfied with the level of improvement we’ve had each game and each week leading up to those games. We just need to continue that trend forward, and by the time Ivy League comes hopefully we’ll have everything down as perfectly and we’ll be able to face those teams with our best foot forward.”
Lehrer hopes his players can build on their progress from game to game, bringing in new techniques and improving upon their system every day.
“We think we can compete in every game,” Lehrer said. “We really in our hearts believe that and believe we have the ability to do that. I feel like that’s one of the strengths of the team is there is constant improvement. We look to improve every moment we can and there’s a lot of detail that comes into that because the players are wanting to do that.”
Noting the success of the freshmen as contributors for the Crimson thus far, Harrington said that he advises them to build on this year for the future.
“Beyond this season, the freshmen have to take in what the seniors, juniors and sophomores are doing now and their process of trying to win games,” Harrington said. “It takes some serious thought and dedication to have that kind of long-term mentality, but your four years here go quicker than you might imagine. The more they’re thinking about the longer term and how they want to lead in the coming years, the better they’ll be going forward.”
Geberkidane’s teammates said they are expecting a lot from the freshman in a very short period of time, as the team begins conference play Oct. 5.
“Ashi will be asked to now step up his role offensively as far as goal production,” Harrington said. “Many of the freshmen have already played quality minutes for us, which isn’t really something you expect; the ability to be mature and acclimate themselves to play Division I coming straight out of high school isn’t normal. For someone to make that jump so quickly and readily is impressive. With his cross country background, he’s made a great transition, just being a guy who can work for as long as we need him to go up there and help our team defensively as a forward, which is not something many forwards are willing to do or able to do.”
Geberkidane appreciates the ability he has been given to fulfill his dream, while preparing for the competition and intensity that conference games will bring.
“I remember growing up as a kid and just thinking Harvard was out of my league,” Geberkidane said. “But now I’m here and living it. Representing Harvard at a higher level is so cool. To put that jersey on every day, to put that practice stuff on reminds me how hard I worked to get here. I love wearing that ‘H’ going on the field more than anything in the world and I’ve got to do my part for our team by capitalizing on scoring opportunities.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Under the bright lights of Cumnock Field, the Harvard women’s rugby team took the field Tuesday night for its first-ever game as a varsity squad.
“It was emotional,” Crimson coach Sue Parker said. “It was emotional for us coaches, too. We’ve been waiting for the varsity opportunity to come along, and to have it happen with these incredible women at a school like this really made it something special. There was a lot of emotion in the locker room ahead of time. They were able to focus it and bring it to the field.”
Droves of Crimson fans filled the bleachers as Harvard (0-1) faced off against visiting Quinnipiac (3-1) for a chilly night contest. Despite keeping pace with the Bobcats for much of the first half, the Crimson ultimately fell too far behind in the second, dropping a 39-10 decision.
“There was a lot of really great effort out there,” co-captain Xanni Brown said. “This team showed a lot of heart. Obviously, you hope for a different result to start your season, but we’re really proud of how everyone played.  We saw some really good things that we can build off for the rest of the season.”
It was a back-and-forth game for most of the first half, as neither team put up any points in the first 35 minutes of regulation. Playing against a more experienced squad, Harvard showed signs of brilliance with some near misses and hard stops.
“I think we saw what [the inexperienced Harvard squad’s] potential is in the first half of the game,” Parker said. “The first 35 minutes, we dominated possession, we dominated territory. We were pounding on the door. But for a few little mishaps and miscommunication, we would have scored a bunch of tries.”
With just five minutes left in the first half, Quinnipiac got on the board after sophomore wing Natalie Kosko ran in for the first try of the game, putting the Bobcats up, 5-0.
“I’m not surprised that Quinnipiac came out extremely strong,” Parker said. “This is their fourth match. They’ve had a bunch of really tough opponents that have helped them work out some of their kinks, and now we’re beginning that process.”
Just minutes later, Bobcat freshman Maggie Myles ran in for another try, and Quinnipiac picked up a conversion to take a 12-0 lead at the half.
“We made some technical adjustments at halftime,” Brown said. “But it was also a matter of going back to our game plan and talking about taking that launch on defense, so we start our offense when they have the ball and we’re driving them backwards the whole time. That’s something we really did well for a few minutes here and there, and it’s something we’re going to work on going forward.”
The Bobcats registered two more tries at the start of the second half to claim a 22-0 lead before Harvard finally got on the board. Junior winger Aniebiet Abasi broke away in a sprint and penetrated the Quinnipiac defense to give the Crimson its first try of the night.
Two more tries and a conversion later, the Bobcats had extended its lead to 34-5 before Brown pushed passed the Bobcats line to bring Harvard to 10 points on the night. Despite strong last-minute efforts, the Crimson was unable to capitalize again before time ran out, and a late try by the Bobcats ended the contest, 39-10.
“[We] really, really played with a lot of heart,” Parker said. “Even in the 80th minute, we were pounding on the goal line. I think if the game had gone on a little bit longer, we would have scored even a couple more tries.”
Despite the loss, Harvard still relished the opportunity to open its inaugural varsity season in front of a home crowd.
“It’s been amazing,” Brown said. “We’ve heard from generations of Radcliffe alums, other teams, other students who just stopped to say ‘good luck.’ It’s been amazing to have the whole support of the Harvard community behind us. That was a really wonderful thing for us to carry into the game, and I think that really is what helped us sustain that great effort, especially through the first half.”
With its first game of the season under its belt, the Crimson will hit the field Saturday against Yale in search of its first win of the season.
“We have a lot of really committed players on this team,” Brown said. “They’re all going to be back Saturday, and they’re going to be hungry for a win.”

Well, this is awkward. Wellesley just made it much easier to get to—and from—Harvard on weekend mornings than it is for actual Harvard students who live in the Quad to get to the Yard or the River.
Wellesley's "Senate Bus," which runs between the Wellesley campus and Cambridge, now runs on weekends starting at 9 a.m.
Compare this to Harvard's weekend "Crimson Cruiser," which doesn't start its route until 12:20 p.m. on weekends—over three hours later.
At least the Cruiser offers the luxury of being dropped off at various "convenient" locations around campus (behind Lamont, anybody?), whereas Wellesley's bus will only drop you off at the Johnston Gate—you'll have to fight through the mobs of tourists on your own.

As Harvard students, we like to stay pretty informed. Crisis in Syria? We got it. New iPhone 5C release? We got it. Cheating scandal? We got that too. Twerking? Well, we don't really got that. While most of the world critiqued Miley Cyrus' twerking at the 2013 VMAs, Harvard students are still concentrating on the basics. To the disappointment of many, the Class of 2017 was not asked in the freshman survey how they would rate their twerking abilities—however, it is clear from a scientific study of a night out in Cambridge that all Harvard students could use a quick tutorial.
 
Let's face it, twerking is a little advanced for most of us—even the greatest dancers here are still trying to wrap their minds around the mechanics of grinding. So let’s go back to the basics, starting with the Cha Cha Slide.
 
Recommended, but not required: Liquid courage and practice in the Delphic basement.
THE BASICS: DJ Casper's "Cha Cha Slide"
 
"This time we’re gonna get funky."
 
No, no, no. You studied for the SATs far too hard to justify using the word "funky." You're not allowed to cheat, but seriously, ask your friends for some tips. Take some time between your CS50 pset and your Chinese class to have a dance break (the best kind of study break) with your entryway's resident dancer. Let them show you how to work it. Dancers do exist at Harvard—although it's hard to spot one on a Saturday night. Find one and pay her (or him) in love and Insomnia Cookies.
 
"Take it back now y'all."
 
I don't know what parties you’ve been going to, but most parties at Harvard are pretty cramped. This means two things: 1. You have very little space to show off your rockin' moves and 2. You'll be sweating. A lot. Dress accordingly. Don't be that guy who's hogging the entire floor and dripping pools of sweat. You may be getting down and dirty on the dance floor, but there are some lines that just shouldn't be crossed. Remember those grind-lines that were all the rage at Bar Mitzvahs and Sweet Sixteens? Let's not revisit that.
 
"Cha cha real smooth."
 
Except, maybe don't actually cha cha… See, I'm never surprised when my classmates talk about going to Cotillion or being "classically trained" in dance. This is not the same, guys. Unless you're at Fete, keep the formal grooving to a minimum.
