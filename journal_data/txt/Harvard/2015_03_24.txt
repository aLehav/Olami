After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although Pforzheimer House has a recording studio that dates back to the 1980s, it was not until a few years ago that the studio became the student organization Quad Sound Studios. Since 2012, the space has undergone extensive management restructuring that led to fundraising campaigns and equipment renewal. Now it aims both to train aspiring music producers and to facilitate Harvard affiliates spreading their work.
Matt P. Sheets ’15, who helped lead the renovation, hoped to combine his interest in music and skills in computer science by exploring recording. When he learned that the recording studio at Harvard was lacking up-to-date equipment, he launched a campaign to fund Quad Sound Studios and, together with his teammates, spent a year raising more than $20,000. “There aren’t many grants on campus for hardware purchasing,” Sheets says. “Interestingly, this kind of forced us to reach out to alumni. We had small donations from a lot of alumni, and many donors helped us connect to other people we [could] talk to.”
Eventually, with grants from the Undergraduate Council and donations from both individuals and companies (including Avid and Shure), Quad Sound Studios obtained more state-of-the-art equipment and renovated the space, Sheets says. Now, with two Steinway grand pianos and a brand new, full-service recording studio, it is equipped to meet the needs of musicians from the Harvard community.
In the spring semester of 2014, Quad Sound Studios opened for recording and initiated a comp process to train students to use their professional recording facilities. Last January, it also organized a winter program for undergraduate students to have jam sessions, collaborate with one another, and record their music—ranging from classical to rock to rap—free of charge. Today, members have access to the studio anytime, and other students interested in recording their music can go to the studio’s website and connect with a member who will lead them through the recording process. Sheets believes it is important that anyone interested in music, with or without prior experience in recording, can utilize the studios. The comp therefore does not require any musical background, and whoever finishes the comp becomes a member.
The organization hopes to meet the needs of both sound engineers and musicians, Sheets says. For example, Michael C. Slovenski ’15, the current president of the studio, had been involved in bands and recorded music on his own and decided to join Quad Sound Studios to become more familiarized with the recording side of music.
According to Sheets, once the studio becomes stable and sustainable, it wants to reach out more to the general public, including not only Harvard affiliates but also possibly musicians in the Cambridge community. At this time, however, it is focused on internal organization. “The priority of the studio is still to recruit more members and get the organization up and running,” he says.
Looking ahead, Quad Sound Studios wants to be more than a recording space. It plans to build a platform for music-driven individuals to collaborate with one another, develop their skills, and find their way to a bigger audience.

“Art, for an impressionist, is a bad tease,” states Giovanni Bernini, the protagonist of Jacob Rubin’s debut novel, “The Poser.” According to Giovanni, art can be mimicked, but never to the satisfaction of the mimicker. For always out of reach in these objects is what he calls something or someone’s “thread”—that is, the essence of a person which peeks through his or her disguise. It is just this human spark that is so delightfully present in Rubin’s own work. Through his cartoonish characters and magical realist premise, Rubin has managed to tease out some fundamental aspects of the human condition in a way that makes his new novel genuinely exciting.
The concept that “The Poser” lays out is thoroughly original. Giovanni Bernini is not only blessed with a talent that allows him to imitate any person, animal, or inanimate object—he is also compelled to do so at all times. This has two vital implications. First, Giovanni must frequently repress the urge to mimic strangers and friends wherever he goes. Often Giovanni’s impressions burst forth uncontrollably, causing trouble in many of his relationships. But second, and more importantly, no one, not the reader nor even Giovanni himself, knows who the real Giovanni is. He is merely a vessel, a blank canvas, a book unwritten.
This bold premise, and a smattering of plot points along the way, begin to cross a line into magical realism. Bernard, who owns the establishment where Giovanni gets his start as a performer, provides fodder for imitation so delicious that Giovanni becomes addicted to it like a drug. Later, another character discovers he has an allergy to money—or, more precisely, “to those objects that through any concatenation of events led me to money.” Contact with such objects imbued with the idea of money causes this man to break out in a terrible full-body rash.
As with most magical realism, what would superficially belong in the realm of fantasy is in fact deeply representative of the realities of life in human society. Though Giovanni is an unconventional individual, and his ability goes far beyond the bounds of realistic possibility, his central predicaments—feeling unsure of his true self, mirroring other people, and constantly feeling like a fraud—are, in fact, universal angsts heightened to the level of the magical. Within Giovanni himself and through his eclectic observations, Rubin manages to explore many facets of human nature without overextending himself. In particular, Giovanni notices the ways in which every individual masks who he or she is and pretends, even subconsciously, to be someone or something else. He has insights into the behavioral trends of whole professions—from actors, to prostitutes, to politicians, to therapists. Through observation alone, Giovanni quickly catches on to certain patterns. He notices, for instance, that the key to a politician’s speech, “was to have said things so many times that when you were delivering the line…you weren’t ever thinking about the words, but about some essential, misdirected thing.”
Rubin’s language is luscious but never overdone. Giovanni describes his grade school crush as “the chandelier of my brain.” And, after a night spent in the arms of fellow performer Lucy Starlight, he recalls, “I woke at dawn, kind of jet-lagged to be on Earth.” With his knack for constructing the perfect analogy, Giovanni breaks down in a mere sentence or two the mechanisms of many previously unilluminated gestures. Imitating Bernard, for example, he nods “in the jaunty, unserious way of a drug person, that is to say, as if some jazz, audible only to me, were playing in a nearby room.” On a separate occasion he tries imitating the expression his friend and agent, Max, outside by the pool—“as if the sun were a grandmother pinching his cheek.” Like a reverse magician who draws the audience’s attention to the trick rather than the misdirection, Rubin through Giovanni elucidates for his readers the minute details of human behavior.
However, there are moments when language is an obfuscating force in “The Poser.” Certain surreal and disjointed passages meant to convey tangled emotional states are unsuccessful and difficult to follow. In a highly medicated state following a mental breakdown, Giovanni recounts the whereabouts of his body as a foreign entity. But the excerpt becomes confusing when the narrator adds in synesthetic descriptions and hallucinations: “Fractures would open in its fingers and around its ankles…Soon its legs would shear off at the knee.” These moments, though they go awry, are few and far between, and they demonstrate Rubin’s willingness to experiment with style in the service of honestly depicting his protagonist’s experience.
The novel also has an impressive sense of movement, both physical and temporal, though its setting at any given time is ambiguous, riddled with fictional locations that hint at real ones. The book is split into three sections, each against a backdrop distinct from the last. While the story begins to drag in the middle section, the third and final segment of the novel breaks from conventional writing wisdom in the way only a talented writer can, quite literally psychoanalyzing its main character and explaining outright much of the deeper existential meaning behind Giovanni’s condition. This is all done without seeming patronizing or entirely exposing the “man behind the curtain.” In fact, this section is perhaps the strongest of the book, tying it together quite beautifully with just the right amount of realism and sentimentality.
Giovanni’s powers of imitation may impossibly defy any existing impressionist’s limitations, but his ability to articulate all the subtleties of human behavior that so often go unnoticed is entirely real. The novel is full of insights into human nature, as if Rubin himself had some sort of arcane power. In its totality, “The Poser” is a debut novel that demonstrates inspiring originality—of premise, of plot, and of style.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the conclusion of short-story writer Kirstin Valdez Quade’s riveting “Ordinary Sins,” small-town priest Father Paul lies defeated on the dust-coated carpet of his rectory bedroom, confessing his transgressions in a last-ditch attempt to exorcise inner demons. “Forgiveness is a drug, too,” he stammers. “Believe me. You can forgive and forgive until you’re high on it and you can’t stop. It’ll numb you as much as any of that stuff.” But what sears the scene into the reader’s memory is not the dignified leader’s fall from grace. Rather, it is the unexpected identity of his confidant: Crystal, the church’s pregnant, unmarried secretary.
It is moments like these—melancholic, grimly ironic, yet utterly hopeful—that establish Quade as a literary voice to be reckoned with. Throughout the past five years, her masterfully crafted fiction has been published in The Best American Short Stories, The New Yorker, and elsewhere; only now, however, has she released a complete collection of her work. Despite occasionally eschewing believability for cheap thrills, Quade’s first book of short stories,“Night at the Fiestas,” proves to be a quiet, stunningly rendered meditation on the lingering sting of past mistakes and the hazy path one takes to redemption.
“Fiestas” consists of ten separate stories, each viewed from the perspective of a singular, painstakingly-crafted character: Quade’s protagonists vary widely in ethnicity, gender, age, wealth, and education level. While such disparities in experiences and viewpoints could have muddled other debuts, this collection remains cohesive due to a few common threads weaved between chapters. Notably, each character longs to reach some sort of salvation, seeking to escape an unforgiving northern New Mexico’s vicious cycle of food stamps and broken promises. Oftentimes, reminders of what could have been manifest themselves physically, whether in the form of a now-dilapidated family home (“The Guesthouse”) or a stunning ballgown never again to be worn (“Mojave Rats”). The most outstanding link between stories is Quade’s glowing use of language; like a Southwestern desert breeze, her prose glides across the page, and a plethora of phrases—“her attention swept over me the way I imagined a wave would, warm and slow and salty”—are unabashedly gorgeous.
For inexperienced writers, crafting short stories can be disarmingly tricky. The confines of 30-or-so pages necessitate a more indirect description of characters, often precipitating bloated caricatures of protagonists. What’s more, individual voices are at risk of coalescing by the sixth or seventh story, with each character beginning to sound remarkably like those before. Quade, however, adroitly avoids such pitfalls. The main strength of “Fiestas” lies in how impressively she has fleshed out her characters: Each is flawed, funny, and incredibly real. She juggles a multitude of unique voices, from an 11-year-old gently examining the constraints of religion, to a lonely mother desperate to escape “a future as barren as the salt flats,” to a deadbeat father playing Jesus in a local religious production. Quade possesses an eye for minute, quirky details: For example, sentimental Jeff “mourns even memories that aren’t his.” These subtle observations breathe new life into what could be perceived as tired stories.
Refreshingly, Quade refuses to conclude any story with a tidy, optimistic ending. Instead, each conclusion is amorphous, the characters’ problems left unresolved, a choice that decidedly bolsters the unwavering realism of her collection. In the thought-provoking “Jubilee,” farmer’s daughter and Stanford student Andrea attends a party thrown by the family of her wealthy classmate, Parker. As the event progresses, she becomes acutely aware of her own race and class-based insecurities and flushes with jealousy at the sight of Parker’s ostensible happiness. But it’s the resolution—or lack thereof—that truly impresses: Instead of establishing a makeshift friendship with her peer, Andrea remains disillusioned by the sight of the immense privilege inundating her. “She’d forever be checking ethnicity boxes, emphasizing her parents’ work: farm laborer, housekeeper. Trying to prove she was smart enough, committed enough…to be granted a trial period in their world.” Quade is not satisfied with giving her characters the easy way out, and the omission of a clean narrative arc, with each tale resembling a blurry snapshot rather than a neatly wrapped package, adds to the inherent grittiness of each story.
On occasion, however, Quade’s storytelling veers dangerously close to the overly whimsical. In “Family Reunion,” 11-year-old atheist Claire embarks on a weeklong excursion with her best friend’s Mormon mother Patsy, where they bond over their lack of connection to their respective families. As the two begin to grow close, Patsy begins to act increasingly intimate toward young Claire, eventually kissing her on the mouth. While it’s clear what message Quade is attempting to convey—that mutual feelings of loneliness can unite even the most diametrically opposite personalities—the means through which she conveys it borders on the absurd, even exploitative. “Fiestas” works wonders when Quade is simply exploring the complexities of her characters, within the constraints of what is believable to the reader. It is only when she springs nonsensical, somewhat uncomfortable developments on her audience that she disrupts the inherent flow of her book.
A few minor faults notwithstanding, “Night at the Fiestas” truly is a brilliant piece of literature. It  transcends the prototypical modern short story collection because, unlike many of her fellow young authors, Quade possesses an extraordinary insight into human nature. She analyzes the aspirations and motivations of her motley crew of characters with a laser-like precision, and, as a result, each feels infinitely relatable. Her writing is simultaneously taut and rich with breathtaking imagery, her stories imbued with tender urgency. Throughout her book, Quade’s characters dream of some validation for their own existence, but rarely do these fantasies ever materialize. Quade, on the other hand, will surely evade the same fate; with “Fiestas,” she has proven herself to be an author readers won’t soon forget.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 2006, a student at the Harvard Graduate School of Design attended a lecture by Dr. Paul E. Farmer, one of the founders of the Boston-based nonprofit healthcare organization Partners in Health. The talk, which focused on hospitals built in Haiti, inspired the student to approach Farmer and ask about his own possible contributions, only to learn that architects played little role in the development—some designs were drawn on the back of a napkin by Farmer himself.
Now as Michael P. Murphy, the student of the story, Skypes in from Rwanda, he reflects on the interaction. His shock came from a realization that Farmer and his colleagues, despite their work in constructing buildings in developing nations, lacked the design expertise that students were learning across the street at the GSD. “I knew that it wasn’t a problem of vision per se,” he says. “It was really a problem of access.” According to Murphy, he registered that most architects lack access to global health and development projects, and this gap motivated him to pursue further correspondence with Farmer.
Years later, on Jan. 24, 2011, the Butaro Hospital opened its doors in the Burera district of Rwanda. The hospital is the product of years of collaboration among Murphy, other architects from his firm Model of Architecture Serving Society Design Group, PIH, the Rwandan government, and Rwandan citizens. Hailed by PIH as an example of the ideal way to build a modern hospital in rural Africa, the project created over 2,000 jobs for the Burera population and provided the opportunity for world-class care in a region that, at the time, had little access to healthcare.
The Butaro Hospital, a collective endeavour across Harvard schools and affiliated groups, serves as a model of thoughtful construction while also occupying a position in a general discussion concerning the architecture profession. This conversation is one regarding the discipline’s relevancy to the public despite usually serving a small patronage. It is one about the design knowledge required for developmental projects and architecture’s connection with humanitarianism. And as the talk moves past building walls to the Harvard classroom and even museum exhibitions in New York, a new perspective about the field is emerging: one in which architecture exists as more than a pinnacle of aesthetics but also as an ethical contribution to society.
When Dr. Michael L. Rich, a physician in the Division of Global Health at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, first received news of a volunteer architecture student coming to help him, he was skeptical. “I was like, ‘Oh, God, no. The last thing I want is to have to babysit an architect student,’” he says in a Skype call from Madagascar. But PIH had plans for new buildings and repairs. So Rich, stationed in Rwanda at the time as the director of PIH’s program in the country, decided to give the student Murphy a six-week trial period. Murphy left an impression; he ended up staying for much longer than six weeks and began a collaboration between PIH and himself that would eventually lead him to the Butaro Hospital and Rwanda.
What Murphy and Alan A. Ricks, co-founder and COO of MASS Design Group, discovered in Rwanda was what Murphy described as a nation without the proper infrastructure for growth. According to Murphy, when he arrived in 2008, Rwanda had fewer than 10 architects—if they could be called that, as the country did not have an architectural licensing board. “There wasn’t a dialogue about designing things in ways that reflected the need for sustainability,” he says.
The country fared no better in terms of healthcare. Rich says there were hospitals and health centers in most of Rwanda’s 40 districts with community health workers to staff them, but there were some, like Burera, that lacked hospitals. According to Rich, this meant PIH needed to consider building blocks like health services and infrastructure, medical staff, medical products, health financing, medical information, and building management. The position architecture had in these essential ingredients, however, was initially uncertain.
Even before the Butaro Hospital, architects had already begun considering their roles in developing infrastructure and serving the public. Months before the hospital opened, the Museum of Modern Art featured 12 such projects in the exhibition “Small Scale, Big Change: New Architectures of Social Engagement.” Running from October 2010 to January 2011, it showcased buildings that highlighted architects interested in taking responsibility and changing local traditions through their works. For instance, one design was a primary school in Gando, a village in Burkina Faso whose school was greatly damaged. Another project displayed was the upgrade of Rio de Janeiro’s Manguinhos district, a large urban area where some 28,000 people lived in informal settlements close to industrial plants.
The uniting factor among all the works in “Small Scale, Big Change” was the improvements the designs made for the inhabitants in the community. “One of the most important criteria…was to show…projects that already had a measurable success in the community,” says Andres Lepik, the curator of the exhibition and presently a professor at the Technical University of Munich and the director at the Architecture Museum of the Pinakothek der Moderne.
Though some interest in developmental projects exists, Lepik feels more introspection is paramount because the majority of architects do not serve the general public. “Most architects in our developed world work for a very small percentage of the global population,” he says.
Rahul J. Mehrotra, a professor at the GSD who specializes in urban planning and design, agrees. “In today’s politics, architecture as a profession [has shifted] to focus on where the patronage is, and the patronage is where there’s big capital,” he says. According to Mehrotra, the rise of neoliberalism, an economic philosophy that emphasizes the market, contributes to this change, which he sees as a troubling conversion.
According to Ricks, the shift away from designing something with a fundamental effect on people’s lives was what contributed to his decision to work on the Butaro Hospital. “It was a little bit disheartening as an architecture student to see surrounding work just focused on form finding, trying to create novel shapes that were disconnected from the people who used the buildings,” he says.
In that way, Mehrotra believes projects like the Butaro Hospital show that venues are available for aspiring architects to design buildings with social impact. “The hospital project is important because it not only shows an enlightened architect, but more importantly it shows an enlightened patronage,” he says.
Murphy had never designed a hospital, let alone a building, when he was commissioned to work on the Butaro Hospital. Merely graduate students at the time (Murphy would graduate in 2011 and Ricks in 2010), Murphy, Ricks, and other colleagues first produced a building draft that was soon discarded due to its unfeasibility. “We weren’t really in the community,” he says.
In response to this detachment, the architects left for Rwanda to work closely with Rich, Bruce Nizeye, who was the construction director for the hospital, and the people there and to gain the knowledge needed to create a sustainable design. “We tried to design [the hospital] so that it’ll have the correct flow of patients and the correct infection control measures,” Rich says.
According to Murphy, the architects’ education did guide a portion of their planning; he cites insights from professors at the GSD and the Harvard School of Public Health as valuable in helping him understand hospital design and factors like airborne infection control. He adds, however, that a large part of their knowledge came from on-site experience. “We have to work on architecture with the community...which we’re serving,” Murphy says. “That was a big part of my architectural education.”
David A. Sanderson, a professor at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, echoes Murphy’s sentiments. Sanderson’s work focuses on both development and disasters, and he says that designing for developing nations requires a different understanding than what most traditional training provides; for instance, it depends on greater engagement with the people who will use the buildings rather than the ones who commission it. “I had to really unlearn everything I learned as an architect,” he says. “Architects are trained…to be orientated around the product. But a lot of disaster response is often around the process, not the product.”
If the process of engaging with the people and area is a crucial part of constructing a successful building, then Butaro’s architects were able to fulfill the criteria. According to Murphy, the architects focused on interactions with the community to create a hospital that was locally sourced and influenced. Inspired by the form of a typical Rwandan single story building, the design used only materials from the region, including volcanic rock from the nearby Virunga Mountains.
Stephanie Kayden, who teaches a course on international humanitarian response at the School of Public Health, says that the Butaro design exhibits certain ingenuity and awareness about the local environment; this, she claims, is what makes it so successful. Specifically, she cites the use of porches and natural breezes over air conditioning to cool the building—an important detail to consider because the maintenance of air conditioning would have been more costly. “The Butaro Hospital specifically takes advantage of things like the natural breezes that come through the building and uses it in an appropriate way,” she says. “[The architects] did a good job of understanding what it means to try to maintain a building.”
If the role architecture played in developing health infrastructure was unclear before, then MASS Design Group’s work asserted the discipline’s significance in global health. “I always kind of thought we had to build the buildings, and it’s not that complicated,” Rich says. “But there’s a huge field that is related to global health that needs architects and engineers.”
Through its influence on global health, the Butaro Hospital indirectly touches upon questions about architecture’s relevance, its purpose, and humanitarianism. Technically, according to Kayden, “humanitarian” refers to only international disasters and emergency relief, rather than developmental work, but for architects like Ricks, Murphy, and Mehrotra, such distinctions are irrelevant in architecture’s grand scheme.
For them, architecture is innately humanitarian and social. “Architecture is a social act because it involves people…. The relevance of the profession depends on how we serve society,” Mehrotra says. “If we serve a marginalized piece of society, we marginalize ourselves.”
Furthermore, to the architects, the discipline’s commitment to development is crucial to consider not only for the profession itself but also for society. Ricks says good design is important for infrastructure and functionality, citing how poorly designed hospitals can make people more ill but how well-designed clinics can become a long-term investment in improving a nation through its health.
Murphy concurs, saying that architecture is important in improving people’s lives because, unlike proper perception, it does not produce simply commodities or objects to be used. “If we think about buildings as components of the social fabric, they are key to the creation of resilient and stronger communities,” he says.
For Sanderson, this idea of social significance is what underlies architecture and its aesthetics. He describes a photo he took of a woman sitting in a shack after the Gujarat earthquake, and how the shack—though humble—gives her a livelihood and functions as a source of pride. According to him, this image represents the true aesthetic of architecture. “The aesthetic is built on social and economic, not only the visual,” he says. “The aesthetic comes from what it does for you, not what it is.”
The Butaro Hospital has flourished since its initial construction. One year after its inauguration, it unveiled the Butaro Cancer Center of Excellence, which offers services like chemotherapy, previously not available in the area. The effects of the hospital’s construction extend beyond its boundaries, moreover. According to Murphy, the government is now drafting new standards for hospitals and buildings and PIH hopes to build a university close to the hospital. In a land decimated by genocide two decades earlier and a community that lacked electricity until 2007, the recent progress is staggering. “It’s more than the completion of a building,” Murphy says. “It’s a creation of the system.” Lepik agrees, saying, “There’s a new typology of hospitals now coming out of [the project].”
Meanwhile, MASS Design has implemented the strategies from its work on the Butaro Hospital into other areas and countries. According to Ricks, the company has worked on two clinics in Haiti in response to earthquakes—a tuberculosis hospital that cares for the treatment of multidrug resistant TB and a facility for cholera. In the wake of the Ebola crisis in Liberia, the firm is currently working with the government to develop a better infrastructure for healthcare.
As for the profession itself, new developments are occurring among the next generation of architects. In 2013, students graduated from the Kigali Institute of Science and Technology in Rwanda with architecture degrees—the first in the nation and a sign of a growing awareness towards architecture’s significance in developing society. “We are seeing...young Africans who are really going to have a different vision on how architecture can serve their countries,” Rich says.
Lepik affirms Rich’s thoughts, though on a more global scale. “There’s a strong resonance by the students to these kind of topics,” he says. “That gives me the hope that there is some change that is happening in the next generation of architects.” And while the profession continues to assert its place within the development community, the Butaro Hospital and its profound effects demonstrate that steps are being taken.

The phrase “reality-based cooking television series” does not exactly inspire confidence in artistic quality. And perhaps it shouldn’t. Reality TV is notoriously bad, and cooking shows hardly enjoy a high reputation either. That said, few media are without artistic potential, and that potential has been realized in the cooking show “Chopped.”
The game-show rules of “Chopped” are simple enough. There are four contestants; they cook three courses; after each course, a panel of judges decides whom to eliminate until only one winner remains. The show’s distinctive twist is that each course must feature an odd basket of ingredients. So, for instance, the pilot episode required its contestants to cook an appetizer containing baby octopus, bok choy, oyster sauce, and smoked paprika; an entrée with duck breast, green onions, ginger, and honey; and a dessert with prunes, animal crackers, and cream cheese.
Now, here’s where most shows would go so terribly wrong and “Chopped” goes so terribly right: there is nothing else to the show. They could have added complexity to the contest by allowing contestants to make deals with one another, cheat the system somehow, have different central ingredients or access to different supplemental ingredients (everyone on “Chopped” uses the same food pantry to flesh out their courses). This is what most other game shows do: add complexity so that contestants aren’t all playing quite the same game. But “Chopped” avoided this trap.
The producers could have made the show all about the personalities of the contestants, by giving the contestants lots of time to talk about and among themselves, to make various bids for the audience’s affections, etc. Instead, Contestants on “Chopped” wear stunningly dull gray uniforms and mostly just talk about the food they’re preparing.
Admittedly, “Chopped” could be purer in this regard. They do allow contestants to talk about their families and personal struggles a bit, a diversion that ends up somewhat muddying the waters. For the most part, however, “Chopped” is about the merits of its contestants not as people but as chefs.
This is where the show’s purity shines through. By paring back the fluff and distracting elements generally used in television to keep the viewer entertained, “Chopped” becomes a cooking show about—imagine that!—cooking. It also avoids taking the nuts-and-bolts approach of cooking shows that actually attempt to teach their viewers how to cook. Although “Chopped” spends plenty of time documenting technique, the show is less about how to cook and more about what to cook.
The incredible part, for the viewer, is in seeing how differences in culinary background and preferences lead different chefs to take the exact same challenge and spin off in wildly different directions. It is a rare “Chopped” round when any two dishes look even somewhat similar. Even a single episode of “Chopped” is an impressive demonstration of this great variety. Taken altogether, the show (currently at 23 seasons) is a breathtaking monument to the infinite potential of art.
What other show, reality TV or otherwise, is devoted so exclusively to the thought behind the creation of art? There is none. The closest parallel one could draw is to televised music contests like “The Voice” and “American Idol,” which violate all the previously stated guidelines for simplicity and purity so badly that, by the end of an episode, the viewers barely have enough brainspace left to think “(S)he sounded nice,” let alone contemplate and engage in the creative process themselves.
By cutting away almost everything but the essentials in its production, “Chopped” frees itself to begin reaching toward infinity. “Simplicity,” Leonardo da Vinci is reported to have said, “is the ultimate sophistication.” He would have been a fan of “Chopped.”

Disney has come a long way since the initial 1950 release of its animated film “Cinderella.” Now, princesses are not supposed to marry men they have just met, violent sorceresses can become complex anti-heroes, and sisterly love may triumph above romance; the recent “Frozen,” “Maleficent,” and “Into the Woods” have all challenged and reinvented the status quo in new and exciting ways. Surprisingly, however, Disney decided to follow this darkly majestic sequence with a new, nearly unchanged adaptation of the squarely traditional “Cinderella.” Although the story is not substantively innovative, it still provides an enchanting spectacle.
The script makes no alterations to the ancient fairy tale. Young and beautiful Ella (Lily James) enjoys a luxurious childhood before becoming an orphan. Forced into servitude by her cruel stepmother (Cate Blanchett) and rude stepsisters (Sophie McShera and Holliday Grainger), the newly nicknamed Cinderella hopes for a better life despite daily humiliation. Her dreams eventually come true when the local prince holds a ball with the intent of choosing a bride. With a little help from her fairy godmother (Helena Bonham Carter) and miscellaneous garden items, Cinderella arrives at the ball, wins the prince’s heart, and—after some antics involving a glass slipper—becomes queen.
The fairy tale’s main flaw lies in its one-dimensional heroine. In most literary versions and in the original animated movie, Cinderella is pretty, gentle, and passive, but little else. She is hyperbolically and uninterestingly perfect. In the live-action adaptation, however, James frames Cinderella as a fairly normal person who manages to be kind through valiant effort. She responds to abuse with teary eyes, trembling lips, and a slightly strained expression: The viewer can see her fighting against her hurt and anger, and this complexity is much more appealing than inhuman patience. Murmuring her clichéd mantra—“have courage, be kind”—James manages to project a quiet and lovely determination.
Still, Richard Madden brings the same warmth and goodwill to Cinderella’s prince as he does to his “Game of Thrones” character Robb Stark. He also develops a real sense of chemistry with James. Most Disney couples display a strange and total lack of eroticism, but director Kenneth Branaugh and the two actors dare to defy this tradition: Hands touch waists, wrists twist, and slight gasps sound on both sides. Of course, there is no explicit sex, but the attraction is palpable.
All these performances, however, are overshadowed by Cate Blanchett as Lady Tremaine. Using her painted mouth and wide-brimmed hats with almost surgical precision, she expresses a marvelously intricate viciousness; she also successfully conveys the villain’s complex feelings and backstory. Lady Tremaine is evil, but she is also jealous, wounded, and insecure—and funny. Together with McShera and Grainder, she supplies a strong level of amusing obnoxiousness throughout.
More than the compelling acting and successful humor, the movie’s main draw remains its visuals. Besides the breathtaking pre-ball transformation scene, the movie displays masterful, Renoir-esque shots of blooming countrysides, stone castles, magnificent dresses, and sumptuous interiors. One shot in particular exhibits a beautiful sense of whimsical luxury: A birds-eye view of the stepsisters’ bedrooms becomes a frame of splashy, lurid color.
Startling and original, the images are the the most innovative element in a somewhat conventional movie. For all its grace and visual intricacy, “Cinderella” makes no significant attempt to experiment with the Disney canon; it generally contents itself with lovely reiterations of classic themes. Lily James’ prettily-laced corsets seem almost emblematic of the entire project. Still, as a piece of pure and colorful entertainment, the movie succeeds.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As supported by examples ranging from the theory of phlogiston to the social institution of slavery, there are countless examples of societies simply having it wrong. Looking back at any point of time, and even examining our own state of affairs today, we can point to practices and beliefs that make us wonder what we were thinking.
At these times when society simply “has it wrong,” there are an occasional few who question the norms. Those who recognize the wrongs sometimes even gather and take action. On the Harvard campus, I am especially proud of the frequency and force with which we examine social norms. Our campus is characterized by passion, visibility, an incredible support system, and the open-mindedness needed to “give it a whirl”.
Our peers currently stand for their passions through movements ranging from the emBODYindia campaign, which aims to gain recognition for women’s rights, to “I, Too, Am Harvard”, which hopes to make the voices of black students heard. Students are also fortunate to have support hubs that make advances possible, such as the Office of BGLTQ Student Life.
As we continue to seek opportunities for improvement, I believe that we should now boldly and proactively consider vegetarianism, a more controversial and lesser-known practice that supports animal rights.
I can present arguments for vegetarianism that appeal to pathos (just Youtube or Google Images search “slaughterhouse” and feel your stomach churn—these offensive videos are the rule rather than the exception), and I can present arguments that appeal to logos (environmental reasons, health reasons, economic, and yet more animal rights reasons), but the most important step is to achieve agreement that this issue deserves discussion to begin with.
Unfortunately, awareness is a critical first step that has not been adequately achieved for the practice of vegetarianism.
I have not yet heard a peer offer an alternative to the treatment animals in slaughterhouses receive as their necks are broken, throats are slit, and families are taken away. I have not yet heard a campus environmental group hold a discussion about the livestock and meat industry as one of the biggest contributors to water pollution and one of the biggest stresses on our ecosystem. I have not yet seen a student health initiative debunk the “vegetarians lack protein” myth and instead discuss meat consumption as a proven contributor to cholesterol and heart disease, and cancers.
Just as importantly, I have not yet heard from those who maintain a pro-meat stance and are on the other side of the debate.
There has been no opportunity for intellectual engagement on this issue. The “Vegitas” club that once existed seems to have been digested by the malaise of indifference, and other clubs have rarely filled the gaps.  We need to begin allowing for the aforementioned discussions, and I am one of the many responsible for making sure this happens. Of course, I will maintain respect for anyone who disagrees after fair consideration.
The most wonderful aspect of a “thinking society” such as the one found on our campus is ultimately its ability to self-correct even when it has invested in a practice for centuries. I hope that we are ready–in a non-judgmental, understanding manner–to shed the practice of eating the flesh of animals. Before this can happen, however, the veggie lovers and animal right supporters must unite, spread awareness, and facilitate debate.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the height of the Ferguson protests, a picture of a crying young black protester hugging a white cop was widely circulated on Facebook. As the photo became increasingly ubiquitous, it received increasingly sharp criticism. The Guardian’s Jonathan Jones described it as “a choice to be lulled by cotton candy” while the streets are burning outside.
I disagree. At the moment we need sentiment just as much as we need reality.
Securing justice is only possible when we both recognize the extremely harsh realities we face and somehow retain hope that a better life is possible.
When a St. Louis County grand jury announced that there would be no indictment in the police killing of Michael Brown, I thought I wouldn’t be able to cry. In a perverse way, I had become accustomed to reading about the unprosecuted killings of Black people. I had spent so many tears on Oscar Grant, Aiyana Jones, and Trayvon Martin, that I felt emptied out and numb. My surprise and sense of injustice had cooled to cynical resignation. When I learned of the grand jury’s decision in the Michael Brown case, I could only feel the dull familiarity of cases that had come before it.
The tears finally came three days later while I watched the NewsHour with my parents over Thanksgiving weekend. After reporting the rioting in Ferguson, PBS aired a brief segment describing the Watts Bears—a youth football program designed to strengthen relationships between the police and the community in Watts, Los Angeles. Watching a police officer high five an eight-year old and promise to get him a new football helmet, I felt my dormant grief suddenly and violently stirred awake. I quietly left the living room.
From a cynical perspective, the segment was pure sentimentality—the video equivalent of that viral photo. One cop high fiving an eight-year old does not change the fact that blacks are up to four times more likely to be killed by police than whites. Yet both images present us with a dream to work toward and remind us that as terrible as things are, they could be different. Sentiment helps us to channel our anger and pain into social change.
It would be deeply irresponsible to share the crying protester photo without recognizing the broader context of race relations in America. At the same time, relentlessly focusing on the harsh realities of police brutality and mass incarceration without recognizing exceptions to the rule eventually leads to burnout and apathy.
The challenge is to follow the middle path—to maintain our awareness of oppression without becoming desensitized to it. Perhaps being able to cry, even at a 15-minute segment on the Watts Bears, is a quiet victory.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu prevailed in his reelection campaign. Unfortunately, the controversial statements he made during the campaign have overshadowed his victory. Last Monday, Netanyahu appeared to reverse his support for a two-state solution, a long-held pillar of both Israeli and American policy. And during Wednesday’s election, a Facebook video from his Likud party quoted him as decrying high Arab turnout in comments with clear racial overtones. Even though he has since walked back his apparent rejection of and apologized for his election day remarks, these statements and Netanyahu’s subsequent election successes are reflective of a broader and deeper sentiment that is both harmful to Israeli democracy and America’s relationship with Israel.
Sadly, the blatantly racial rhetoric Netanyahu used during the recent election is far from an aberration in the political climate he has engendered. Recent proposals from Netanyahu’s government like one for a Jewish nationality law have moved Israel’s political system in the wrong direction. As President Barack Obama put it in a recent interview, “Israeli democracy has been premised on everybody in the country being treated equally and fairly,” and that idea is under threat. Certainly, Netanyahu’s most recent statements about his pride in governing a diverse Israel are a positive step forward; this rhetoric, however, must be backed by action.
In addition to the deleterious effects of these comments on Israel’s democratic institutions, they reflect a lack of seriousness about the long-term U.S.-Israel relationship on the part of the current Likud government. When coupled with Netanyahu’s controversial address to Congress as well as past insults like a settlement announcement during a visit by Vice President Joseph R. Biden, it is becoming clear that he places a far higher priority on his own political survival than on his country’s critical relationship with the United States. Not only does America’s unyielding support lend credibility to the Israeli government, but it also provides crucial aid and military protection that represent a vital safeguard of Israel’s national security.
Moving forward, the United States needs to make good on the President’s recent signals and reassess the nature of its relationship with Israel, especially with Netanyahu in power. The White House’s initial moves to question America’s traditional unfailing support for Israel at the United Nations are steps in the right direction. Unfortunately, the lack of alternative partners in the Middle East and the relative solidity of Netanyahu’s political base constrain the U.S.’s options. That said, the administration must begin to more seriously question the apparently unconditional status of our massive economic, diplomatic, and political support for Netanyahu's government.
This election is a step backward for Israel. The rhetoric alone has harmed the political inclusivity of the Israeli system, the credibility of its government, and the prospects for peace in the region. Regardless of whether Netanyahu is right or wrong on the peace process, Iran, or a host of other domestic issues, the election of a candidate so shameless in his politicking is unfortunate. Israel deserves better.

UPDATED: March 23, 2015, at 10:36 p.m.
A Massachusetts Superior Court judge dismissed a lawsuit filed by a group of Harvard students against the University late last year, which urged Harvard to divest from fossil fuel companies.
“Plaintiffs have brought their advocacy, fervent and articulate and admirable as it is, to a forum that cannot grant the relief they seek,” reads the memo, signed by Superior Court Justice Paul D. Wilson.
The 11-page complaint, filed last November by seven Harvard students who call themselves the Harvard Climate Justice Coalition, claimed Harvard’s investment in fossil fuels is “a breach of [Harvard’s] fiduciary and charitable duties as a public charity and nonprofit corporation.” The plaintiffs, all members of the activist group Divest Harvard, also charged that the University is misallocating its funds by investing in “abnormally dangerous activities.”
The group plans to appeal the decision, according to Harvard Law School student Joseph “Ted” E. Hamilton, one of the plaintiffs.
The lawsuit’s dismissal, dated March 17, comes after Harvard and the State Attorney General’s office filed motions to dismiss the case and then attended a hearing on the matter last month.
In his decision to dismiss the case, Wilson argued that the “Plaintiffs’ status as Harvard students…does not endow them with personal rights specific to them that would give them standing to charge Harvard with mismanagement of its charitable assets.”
Wilson also took issue with the plaintiffs’ argument that Harvard’s continued investment in fossil fuels contributes to the “diminishment” of the group members’ education and has “a chilling effect on academic freedom,” as the group wrote in its original complaint.
“The very existence of this lawsuit, filed by members of the Harvard community to stop Harvard from investing in fossil fuel companies, shows that Plaintiffs have failed to plead facts ‘plausibly suggesting’ that Harvard’s fossil fuel investments have had ‘a chilling effect on…the willingness of faculty, students, and administrators to publicly confront climate change,’” Wilson wrote.
Wilson further cited what he saw as a lack of “limits on the subject matter and scope” of the lawsuit, which argues that climate change poses such a threat  to “Future Generations” that the court must order Harvard to divest.
“If Plaintiffs can bring this lawsuit, nothing would prevent other students from seeking court orders that Harvard—or any other charitable organization—take other actions to deal with the ‘exceptional risks’ posed by whatever danger to Future Generations those other students fear above all others,” Wilson wrote. “Plaintiffs’ suggested limiting principle imposes no limits at all.”
Responding to the decision, Hamilton said he had expected the lawsuit might be dismissed because of its novelty, but he said the group still plans to appeal, a process that he expects may take months. The group will  be looking to gather amici briefs from supporters during that time, he said.
“We're all disappointed by this initial result, but we're already working on the appeal,” Hamilton said.  “We are viewing this as a longer process, and this is just a first step. We're moving forward all together as a group.”
University spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard remains focused on addressing climate change through research initiatives. University President Drew G. Faust has many times said Harvard will not divest, arguing it can best address climate change through the research and work of its faculty and affiliates.
“As the Court notes in its decision, Harvard has been, and continues to be, focused on supporting the research and teaching that will ultimately create the solutions to this challenge,” Neal wrote.
Despite Faust’s arguments against divestment, activists have organized this spring to protest Harvard’s decision not to divest from fossil fuels in other ways. In February, members of Divest Harvard occupied Massachusetts Hall for roughly a day, and the group is planning to bring alumni to campus for a week-long protest in April.

The Eli and Edythe L. Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT announced a partnership last week with Calico, a life sciences company backed by Google, to advance research on age-related diseases and therapeutics.
Eric Lander, president and director of the Broad Institute, said in the press release announcing the partnership that the collaboration will foster progress on the understanding and treatment of age-related disease by combining the Institute’s scientific knowledge with Calico’s expertise in therapeutics.
Much of the Institute’s work focuses on uncovering the genetic basis of major diseases and brings together researchers from Harvard, MIT, Harvard-affiliated hospitals, and other partner institutions.
Calico Life Sciences LLC, short for California Life Company, is a biotech research and development company with the aim of building understanding of aging and its associated diseases. The company is currently led by CEO Arthur D. Levinson, the former CEO of Genentech and a former director at Google. Calico was founded by Levinson and Google.
"This alliance is a key part of Calico's strategy to bring the best cutting-edge science to bear on problems of aging,” Levinson said in the press release.
The Broad Institute has a wide range of collaborations, including more than 100 projects across more than 40 countries, according to its website. Last year, researchers at the Institute discovered several gene mutations that potentially protect against type 2 diabetes.
Paul Goldsmith, a spokesperson for the Broad Institute, declined to release more details regarding the collaboration because it is still in a developmental stage.

At Harvard Law School, contentious legal debates are commonplace. Whether in a classroom, over lunch, or in the pages of one of the school’s many legal journals, professors and students respond to, critique, and question one another’s views.
But notably, over the past week, University professor Laurence H. Tribe ’62 and Law School professors Richard J. Lazarus and Jody Freeman, in what Tribe described as an “uncommon event in Harvard Law School’s history,” took the discussion to the Harvard Law Today website.
The exchange  began after Tribe testified before the U.S. House of Representatives Subcommittee on Energy and Power on the Environmental Protection Agency’s “Clean Power Plan.” He argued that the plan, which focuses on regulating greenhouse gases from coal-power plants, was unconstitutional and that “[b]urning the Constitution should not become part of our national energy policy.” The testimony grabbed headlines and the attention of his colleagues, sparking an online back-and-forth that has spanned almost a week.
On March 18, professors Lazarus and Freeman first responded to Tribe’s claims, writing, “Like most proposed rules, the Administration’s climate rule is far from perfect, but sweeping assertions of unconstitutionality are baseless.” The debate did not stop there: Tribe then responded on March 20. Lazarus and Freeman rebutted the next day; Tribe replied again March 22.
Lazarus said that he is not sure if the debate will continue.
“We have more we could say, but at some point I think you get diminishing returns. It’s quite clear we don’t agree,” he said.
Lazarus, who studied constitutional law under Tribe when he was a student at the Law School, said that he and Freeman, who both teach environmental law, decided to take the debate online when Tribe’s comments picked up significant media coverage.
“In the normal course of events, if a colleague says something you disagree with on law, you just invite them to lunch,” Lazarus said. “I wrote Larry and said that we weren’t doing that here because his views were getting such press elsewhere, that it wouldn’t be enough, that we actually needed to make it clear publicly, as well.”
For his part, Tribe, who has been at the Law School for years, said the exchange “could have genuine educational value, given the legal and the political centrality of the issues involved and their momentous significance for the future of the planet as well as for the health and integrity of our legal system.”
While the debate has certainly been rigorous, it has not, Lazarus said, been without some fun.
“We’ve tried to keep it in the sphere of collegiality and back-and-forth with some touch of humor, and I hope we’ve succeeded in that,” Lazarus said.

In response to news that edX will collaborate to offer courses with Microsoft and the Smithsonian Institution, some higher education experts said the platform’s non-university partnerships could serve to prepare students for the workforce and provide insights into teaching within higher education.
EdX, a massive open online course platform founded by Harvard and MIT in 2012, will launch seven courses on programming and cloud technologies in collaboration with Microsoft. Although Microsoft already has its own platform, Microsoft Virtual Academy, for learning content, the company’s motivation to partner with edX was partly to offer content that follows the MOOC model, according to a joint statement by Jatinder P. S. Kohli, director of product, and Björn C. Rettig, director of content at Microsoft.
“We have been watching MOOCs closely, and in particular how Harvard uses CS50 to teach Introduction to Computer Science,” they wrote. “EdX courses have a much higher investment in instructional design, interactive simulations, coding exercises, structured hands-on experiences that many learners need.”
A large motivation behind the partnership might also have been to reach edX’s student audience, according to Ray Schroeder, associate vice chancellor for online learning at the University of Illinois Springfield.
Schroeder said there is an increasing number of employers looking for students that have specific technical skills for entry-level jobs, and so collaborating with edX would be a good way to target potential employees.
“In a way, it’s a reflection on us at universities, that employers feel we’ve not given those students the skills they need to enter the workforce,” he said. Consequently, the verified certificates that students gain upon completion of an edX course will carry “significant weight.”
However, Joshua M. Kim, director of Digital Learning Initiatives at the Dartmouth Center for the Advancement of Learning, said verified certificates have yet to prove their worth in the job market even though the courses have the potential to close the skills gap.
“We’re in a new world where credentials are changing,” he said. “We’ll see if these become credentials that employers think are really valuable.”
In addition to Microsoft, edX also partnered with the Smithsonian Institution to launch three courses on American history—one taught by Stan Lee, former president of Marvel Comics.
According to Kim and Schroeder, these new partnerships with non-universities could be in response to new competition from rival MOOC providers like Coursera, Udacity, and even Khan Academy.
“I think we’re going to see a proliferation of partnerships and collaborations, and it won’t just be colleges and universities,” Schroeder said.
Kim said a more important motivation of the new edX partnerships is to facilitate interaction between the teaching styles of higher education and other places of learning.
“Through the edX consortium, we can spend time learning from the Smithsonian and they can learn from us—these are conversations we don’t normally have,” he said, referring to universities. “It helps us to move more quickly, experiment, try things, and take risks.”
Richard Kurin, under secretary for history, art, and culture at the Smithsonian Institution and course instructor for a SmithsonianX course, said edX’s new experimentation could be invaluable to teaching in higher education.
“You know what to expect when you walk into a classroom,” Kurin said. “But in this one, the fact that it is so open and out there, it was kind of liberating. I’m curious to see how it goes.”

UPDATED: April 21, 2015, at 4:38 a.m.
The Allston Construction Mitigation Subcommittee met Monday to discuss progress made on Harvard construction projects and worker parking in North Allston.
Harvard University Construction Mitigation Director Edward G. LeFlore estimated compliance with the University’s new construction worker parking program at around 97 to 99 percent out of 220 workers. The program provides free parking to workers at construction sites and Webster Field and encourages them to ride-share in an effort to reduce the number of construction vehicles parked on Allston streets and in residential neighborhoods. Workers previously paid $15 for parking at the Harvard Business School, according to Allston resident Paul “Chip” Alford.
Alford praised the progress as a “big victory for the community,” but noted that responsibility for further monitoring of the parking situation should fall on the University. In the past, residents have reported illegal parking in two-hour and resident-only zones to the Boston Transportation Department. LeFlore said the University was monitoring the situation daily with “spot checks” in affected areas.
Alford and Allston resident Paula Alexander questioned LeFlore’s compliance estimate, citing the influx of parked vehicles on Travis Street during the week as evidence of continued violations. Alexander raised hopes that Boston would extend its resident parking permit program to Kingsley Street and Travis Street.
LeFlore also provided the subcommittee with an update on the demolition of the Charlesview apartments at the intersection of Western Ave. and North Harvard St. LeFlore reported that building A had been successfully taken down and that “most buildings should be down within the month of April.”
The University will construct a “Gateway Project,” a “mixed-use institutional building,” on the site of the vacant Charlesview apartments, according to Harvard’s Institutional Master Plan for development in Allston. Charlesview residents were relocated to a new apartment complex a half-mile down Western Ave. during the summer of 2013.
LeFlore said workers were conscious of the need for dust control with current wind conditions and are working on moving debris from the demolition sites. The transition to a construction site is expected to happen between this June and September, LeFlore said.
Residents also reacted to the recent string of robberies at the construction site of the Joseph M. Smith Community Health Center, which currently occupies a building leased by the University. The center’s executive director Elizabeth Browne said the new facility, which will “double [the center’s] capacity,” has been robbed three times this year.
Lifelong Allston resident Geri Sullivan raised additional concerns over the spread of rats in residential areas following the start of Harvard’s construction projects in Allston, stating that rats were sighted on neighborhood yards and streets in broad daylight.
“Every time Harvard takes a building down, you upset the rats,” Alford said.

UPDATED: March 24, 2015, at 2:40 a.m.
Members of the core faculty at Lesley University, located less than a half mile from Harvard Yard, filed a petition with the National Labor Relations Board to unionize last week, joining a growing movement of the unionization of private university faculties locally and nationwide.
Jason W. Pramas, an assistant professor of business management and communication at Lesley, who is a leader in the movement toward unionization for core faculty this month and previously for adjunct faculty in February 2014. Lesley University does not have a tenure system.
Pramas said a key issue among core faculty was the lack of control over curriculum and academic programs, an issue he does not see at Harvard.
“I think at Harvard, your tenured and tenure track people absolutely do have that power,” Pramas said. “The university isn’t just going to start up and shut down programs over the heads of faculty in an arbitrary manner as much as they have done [at Lesley].”
In addition to higher pay, Pramas pointed to the “prestige” afforded to regular and adjunct faculty at Harvard and MIT as potential factors in low unionization efforts at those nearby institutions.
“It’s not like we would never want them to be unionized, it’s just that, where are you going to go first?” Pramas said.  “You’re going to go to the places that are really screwed, where there’s a heavy, heavy reliance on adjuncts.”
Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers director Bill Jaeger said while HUCTW union members were “incredibly impressed” with the results of faculty unionization seen at Tufts and other local universities, he thinks Harvard’s faculty are unlikely to follow Lesley’s example any time soon.
“I think it’s further out on the horizon,” Jaeger said. “It hasn’t been a burning, hot question among Harvard adjuncts that I have heard.”
If they successfully unionize, core faculty at Lesley would join the Service Employees International Union Local 509’s Faculty Forward program, which has been joined by Boston-area universities like Tufts, Boston University, Northeastern University, and Bentley University.
Though he said HUCTW is “not actively working on anything” with SEIU currently, Jaeger noted the the potential for a relationship with the University.
“We’re following carefully and trying to stay connected to what SEIU is doing with the faculty at a number of universities,” Jaeger said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Undergraduate Council leaders outlined plans on Monday for a new pilot program, called “The Harvard Project,” that will award grants to a student initiative proposing a solution to a campus problem. The Council formally endorsed the project at its general meeting on Monday.
Through the project, the Council will award $3,000 to one initiative proposed by an undergraduate student or group of students. Proposed initiatives should serve the College student body under a broader aspect of student life, such as sustainability, according to legislation that endorsed the project.
The Council’s Student Initiatives Committee, led by Chair Daniel V. Banks ’17 and Vice Chair Shaiba Rather ’17, will oversee the project alongside faculty liaison Stephanie R. Khurana, who is co-master of Cabot House.
According to Rather, potential initiatives already proposed by students include creating a more cost-effective pre-orientation program for freshmen and establishing a student-run bakery similar to Cabot Cafe. The legislation detailing the project urged students to come forward with feasible solutions to campus problems, saying that “to say Harvard is perfect would be to undermine our capacity and potential for change.”
“Essentially, what we’re trying to do is promote people to reflect on their Harvard experience, and to do something about it,” Rather said.
The UC’s Student Initiatives Committee will be closely monitoring the execution of the project that the Council chooses to fund, according to Rather, who said this “watchdog” aspect of the program will help it succeed.
Also at Monday’s meeting, UC President Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16 and UC Vice President Dhruv P. Goyal ’16 told Council members that they will replenish the Student Relations Committee’s budget after some of its money was used to fund the launch event for the Council’s gender equity campaign, “Side by Side.”
At the UC’s meeting on March 1, several representatives argued that allocating $650 from the Student Relations Committee to the campaign’s launch event was an inappropriate use of Council funds.
The Council gave the Student Relations Committee an additional $650 from its “Bridging and Belonging” grant, which totals $21,000 provided by administrators and the Drug and Alcohol Peer Advisors.
In other business, Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal urged representatives to publicize Ventfull, a smartphone application and events calendar that the UC paid to bring to Harvard in February. If the app is not populated by 30 percent of the College student body by the end of the semester, they said, it risks losing support and sponsorship from administrators.
Several representatives suggested publicizing the calendar to incoming freshmen from the class of 2019, as well as students serving as hosts for Visitas, the College’s upcoming visiting program for admitted students. They acknowledged, however, that prospective students cannot sign up because they do not have Harvard email accounts.
The Council will host an open forum with University President Drew G. Faust and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana on Tuesday. It will be open to all undergraduates.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the biggest stage of collegiate hoops and with his team down, 5-1, senior wing Wesley Saunders corralled the ball near the top of the key. He took one dribble towards the paint before crossing the rock between his legs and stepping back to the top of the circle. He hoisted the ball up near his right shoulder and let the shot fly.
Just one minute later, Saunders held the ball at the top of the key once more. This time, his between-the-legs dribble was followed with two crossovers, losing his defender as he sent the rock back to his strong hand. With just one second to spare on the shot clock, Saunders skipped down the right side of the lane and laid the shot off the glass and into the hoop.
Next, he caught a pass on the left wing, with only seven ticks remaining on the clock. The senior took two hard dribbles towards the baseline before he stopped on a dime, fading backwards as he released his jumper. The swish of the net and the shot clock’s horn rang out at the same time, and Harvard was back in the game.
Fewer than five minutes had elapsed in the Crimson’s NCAA Tournament matchup against North Carolina, but former ACC All-Defensive Team selection J.P. Tokoto had already given a proverbial shake of his head. His assignment was to guard Saunders, who was singlehandedly keeping Harvard in contention in the game’s early going. As the left-baseline fadeaway jumper splashed through the hoop, the score was North Carolina 8, Saunders 7, with each of the latter’s baskets knocked down in his characteristic effortless fashion.
Before the No. 4-seeded Tar Heels (26-11, 11-7 ACC) took the floor against the Crimson (22-8, 11-3 Ivy) on Thursday evening, North Carolina was vague when asked to speak about Saunders’s game.
“He's a really tough matchup,” said Tar Heel point guard Marcus Paige on Wednesday. “I think J.P. will have his hands full, but he's accepting that challenge…. I think [Saunders] was first team All-League in Harvard's league or player of the year or something. Obviously, we're going to respect him and try to make everything tough for him.”
Minutes after a 26-point, 8-of-14 shooting performance from Saunders that willed his Crimson back into the contest and nearly willed it into the Round of 32, North Carolina’s answer regarding Saunders became less ambiguous and more adulatory, with Tar Heel coach Roy Williams acknowledging the defensive difficulty with which Saunders had presented his squad, despite Carolina’s eventual 67-65 victory.
“Well, we thought we had a strategy for him, but it didn't work,” Williams said. “[H]e was a load, and we knew that…. [Tokoto] really did a pretty doggone good job, but he was really, really hard to guard.”
The difficulty in guarding Saunders stems in part from his offensive versatility. Through intermission, Saunders had either assisted on or scored every Harvard basket, a statistic indicative of his play throughout the conference season. Saunders was third in the Ivies in scoring this year, coming in second in assists per game as well—only 0.1 dime per contest behind teammate junior co-captain Siyani Chambers.
This dual ability to create offense for himself or for his teammates with seeming equal ease was exactly what the Tar Heels struggled to contain down the stretch of Thursday’s matchup. Carolina’s lead would climb to as many as 16 before Saunders’s efforts began to make a dent in the score, with four free throws, a three-pointer, and two assists from the wing bringing the Crimson within single digits with 11:55 to go. From there, a trademark Saunders spin move in the paint led to a fadeaway with 7:40 to play, cutting Harvard’s deficit to seven, while his short corner jumper with just three seconds left on the clock brought Harvard within two, 63-61, with only 2:43 remaining.
Thursday’s contest wasn’t the first time that the former Ivy League Player of the Year lit up the stat sheet with all eyes on him—since Saunders became a starter his sophomore season, he’s led his team in scoring in four of the five Tournament games in which it has competed, racking up a combined 86 points in those appearances. Just a week before he shared the court with North Carolina, the senior had offered up a 22-point, 8-of-15 from the floor performance against rival Yale that punched Harvard’s ticket to March Madness, sending the Bulldogs back to New Haven, Conn., as the Crimson began its march towards Jacksonville, Fla.
So, in the waning moments of Thursday’s game, it wasn’t a surprise when Harvard coach Tommy Amaker elected to have the ball in Saunders’s hands with a chance to win the contest. With the Crimson down two and 10 ticks to go, it was Saunders—who had carried his team all night, all season—that held the rock on the perimeter, staring down Tokoto as a group of Harvard fans counted down what were potentially the last seconds of his collegiate career from the stands.
“I realized the clock was running down, so I had to get up a shot,” Saunders recalled.
His contested three-pointer was long, and he turned, masklike, to the Crimson bench where his teammates had fallen silent. It was the last shot in the last game of a collegiate career that Ivy hoops pundits have begun to compare to that of Jeremy Lin ’10, and those in the arena were left with the feeling that if the attempt had been just another inch off, perhaps it would’ve banked into the hoop, extending Saunders’s Harvard playing days one more game.
But Saunders has never been one to play the hypotheticals—to dwell on the what-ifs. His game has always typified the sports cliché of ‘playing in the moment,’ as he continually talks of reading the defense, and choosing his offensive weapon—a pass or a shot—based on how his opponent tries to guard him.
The last-second jumper on Thursday was no exception. He recognized how the defense was set—Tokoto was sagging off, expecting the drive, while a second Tar Heel stood in the passing lane between Saunders and Corbin Miller, the teammate to whom he hoped to send the ball—and went all-in behind a high-arcing, crowd-hushing three-point attempt that seemed to hang in the air for a tick longer than normal.
“It felt kind of good,” Saunders said. “And it just went off the backboard…. [I]t was just demoralizing.”
After the game, Tokoto called Saunders among the “top five” players he’s guarded all year, placing the senior in the ranks of wings from Duke, Kentucky, and Virginia. Teammate and co-captain Steve Moundou-Missi called his performance “second to none” and “incredible,” while Amaker deemed it “exceptional” and “terrific.”
For a player who surpassed Lin in scoring against Yale, who eclipsed the 1500-point career mark in the Big Dance, and had his way against collegiate basketball royalty in North Carolina for 40 minutes on Thursday night, that just-long, just-wide three was not how he hoped his time in crimson would end.
But for all those around him—on the bench, in the stands, and on the court beside him—there wasn’t anywhere else they’d rather the ball be with the game on the line than in Saunders’s possession: in the hands of the player whose trademark fadeaways, spin moves, and ever-calm demeanor had led them to win after win, both under the bright lights of the NCAA Tournament and in front of an ever-packed crowd at Lavietes Pavilion.
“We wanted…for Wesley to make a decision,” Amaker said. “The way he's been playing, [the way] he played tonight—he was outstanding. I thought he was as good as anybody that played in our game here this evening. So if he was going to get a three, get a drive, get a two, we were going to live with his decision there.”
“[W]e came out and battled and we fought against a great team, and that's all you can really ask for,” Saunders added. “I wouldn't rather go out there and battle with any other group of guys…. Everybody is like family. We've been through good times, bad times, and, I mean, it's just been a blessing that I've been able to be a part of this.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
LAKE PLACID, N.Y.—Kyle Criscuolo watches as a Harvard stick knocks away Colgate’s final shot attempt. Behind him, there’s jubilation—the Crimson men’s ice hockey team (21-12-3, 11-8-3 ECAC) has just earned its first conference championship since 2006. Fourth-year goaltender Steve Michalek extends his arms towards the skies. Several others do the same. But until the final horn sounds, Criscuolo’s eyes are on the puck.
CAPTAIN CRISCO
At its annual banquet last April, Harvard made an announcement that broke from tradition. Coming off its second consecutive 10-win season, one that saw the Crimson finish third to last in the conference, Harvard took a different approach when appointing its new leadership. For the first time in almost 70 years, the Crimson elected to look beyond its pool of seniors to find a co-captain.
Criscuolo, a Southampton, N.J., native who logged 20 points his sophomore season, became the guy for the job. Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 gave the then-second-year forward his vote of confidence, and come Saturday, that vote paid dividends.
The Crimson got everything it could ask for out of its co-captain. While junior forward Jimmy Vesey made headlines for his ECAC record-tying eighth goal of the tournament in the first period, Criscuolo made the history happen.
With Colgate defenseman Kevin Lough facing the back boards and the puck on his stick, Criscuolo came barreling in. The co-captain delivered a hit on Lough that sent the defenseman flying, enabling the junior to gain possession of the puck. A few passes through the attacking zone later, it was Criscuolo who forced a shot on Finn from the edge of the crease to produce Vesey’s rebound opportunity.
One period later, with the Crimson up 3-1, Criscuolo continued to cause problems for the Raiders. Michalek got his body on a tipped Spiro Goulakos shot from in close, but the puck escaped him, giving Colgate forward Emilio Audi a prime opportunity inside the crease to punch it home.
But in came Criscuolo. With the Raiders primed to cut their deficit in half, the junior got the puck out of the danger zone with one swipe of his stick, even initiating a two-on-one attack the other way seconds later.
Nonetheless, the co-captain won’t take all the credit for himself.
“There’s a lot of leaders that are on this team,” Criscuolo said. “It’s an honor to be the captain, but I think a lot of the other guys deserve some credit for that.”
Acknowledging the leaders without “C’s” on their chests, Criscuolo pointed to the veterans of the Crimson squad—the ones that have endured their share of tribulations over the course of their Harvard tenures, including two in particular.
PAT’S BACK
When Patrick McNally held the puck near his own goal in Ithaca back in January, he couldn’t have been thinking too far ahead. But when a Cornell skater got tangled up with the blue-liner’s leg, that all changed.
Within a week, McNally revealed that he would be out for the remainder of the regular season. Nonetheless, holding out hope that his teammates could orchestrate a lengthy postseason run, McNally refused to rule out a return. After Harvard made quick work of Brown in the opening round, the defenseman’s optimism came to fruition the ensuing weekend.
At Ingalls Rink for the Crimson’s quarterfinal series at Yale, McNally took the ice. In Harvard’s first taste of an elimination game, the defenseman served as an immediate sparkplug, scoring the equalizer with 3:30 remaining.
With the stakes even higher on Saturday, McNally made up for lost time again. From the right faceoff circle, the blue-liner added what proved to be the game-winning wristshot to extend his side’s advantage to 3-1.
“I know Pat,” Donato said. “He came back to win the championship, and he knew that he could be a big part of it. And certainly he was.”
BACK IN BLACK
McNally missed all but that one game in Ithaca on the back half of the Crimson’s schedule, putting the defenseman in similar company as one of his classmates, Colin Blackwell.
After sitting out the majority of the last two seasons due to recurring concussion issues, the fourth-year forward returned for the season’s final weekend. Afterwards, Blackwell acknowledged that he came back to provide a difference.
“As one of the seniors on the team and [one of the] leaders, I kind of pride myself on getting the boys going and trying to get a little spark,” Blackwell said on Feb. 28.
Over the ensuing seven games, that’s exactly what he did, coming up with five goals and an assist to lift his squad past three of the top four seeded teams in the ECAC. After battling back from another injury scare on Friday, the second-liner clinched the title on Saturday, finding the empty Colgate net with 55 seconds remaining to jumpstart the Harvard celebration.
“I think we certainly were hurting with more than our share of injuries, but I think we have a lot of unselfish players who put the team first,” Donato said. “[I’m] very proud to be involved with this group, and they’re very deserving of a championship.”
