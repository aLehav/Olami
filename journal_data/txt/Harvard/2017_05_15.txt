After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Before there were over 70 libraries at Harvard, there was one. From 1766 to 1820, Harvard Hall was home to both Harvard Library and a space known as the Philosophy Chamber. On May 19, the Harvard Art Museums will open an exhibition that brings back much of the original Philosophy Chamber.
Ethan Lasser, the Theodore E. Stebbins Jr. Curator of American Art and head of the Division of European and American Art, said that working with different pieces in the Museum led him inevitably to the Philosophy Chamber. “I was researching some of our great portraits, including this great work by Copley, and we’d known that they’ve been here a long time but we wanted to know where they had come from originally,” Lasser said. “I kept coming across references to this room called the ‘Philosophy Chamber,’ and it had me at the name because it was such a strange name, and I wanted to know what that meant.”
According to Lasser, the original Philosophy Chamber served as a teaching room, gallery, and convening space. The room held works by notable artists such as John Singleton Copley and John Trumbull. At first, Lasser said that he considered just presenting articles, but the more he found in the Harvard Archives on the voices that were in the room, and the conversation between the objects in the room, the more he realized that the Philosophy Chamber was meant to be a show.
“As interesting to me as the objects are, what the objects reflect is the diversity of people that animated the space,” Lasser said.
The reimagination of this space also involved the work of many undergraduate students. The students have been helping with the curation of the works, and Lasser said that the undergraduate guides also recorded an audio guide for the exhibition.
Samuel J. Shapiro ’18 is an intern in the Division of European and American Art at the Museums and has been working on this project since last fall, though he has worked at the Harvard Art Museums since his freshman fall as a student guide giving tours. He said that he sees this exhibition as critical to the way that the Harvard Art Museums studies its own history.
“I’m always interested in the study of museums and how these museums look at themselves,” Shapiro said. “Although the Philosophy Chamber was not a museum in the modern sense of the word, it didn’t self-consciously consider itself an art museum, but because of its collections, and because many of Harvard Art Museum's current pieces date back to the philosophy chamber, it is sort of the early part of the museum at Harvard.”
With the inspection of its own history comes the revelation of points to be critiqued at the Museum. Though Lasser said the exhibition is in a way a celebration of Harvard’s admirable early history, it also poses some challenging and unsettling facts of the period.
“For example, access to the [Philosophy Chamber] is limited to the white man, basically,” Lasser said. “There are examples of only a few women coming in. It was also a space where they were teaching racial science.”
The exhibition will feature more than one hundred works and a loose reconstruction of what the Philosophy Chamber looked like. Lasser said that many of the objects were found on campus throughout Harvard’s various museums. The geographically farthest object found is a drawing that was made here in 1774 and now lives in the archives of the Royal Society of London. Time has taken a toll on the Philosophy Chamber, however, and some of the original aspects of the Philosophy Chamber cannot be brought back with the exhibition.
“There are certain works that were destroyed or lost or too fragile to put on display,” Lasser said. “To make up for that, we are borrowing some related objects, and one of those comes from the U.K. as well.”
As a joint history of art and architecture and social anthropology concentrator, Shapiro said that the works are very much pertinent to his studies. “Many of the pieces that I work with in my classes date back to the Philosophy Chamber,” he said. Almost 200 years after the original Philosophy Chamber, some parts of the space’s legacy continue to live on in Harvard’s contemporary intellectual discourse.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While more than 60 students enrolled in Harvard’s flagship computer science course last semester were accused of academic dishonesty, only five Yale students faced academic dishonesty charges involving computer code for any course in the same time period.
According to a report from the Yale College Executive Committee, five students at Yale were charged with copying code during the fall 2016 semester. Like Harvard’s Honor Council, the Yale College Executive Committee reviews cases of academic dishonesty.
Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I” debuted in New Haven in fall 2015 as Yale College’s largest class, though enrollment fell significantly the next year. The course at Yale, which follows the same structure as the one at Harvard, grades students by their work in nine problem sets, a take-home quiz, a take-home exam, and a final project. Both schools’ courses have identical syllabi and collaboration policies.
Yale professor and Executive Committee Chair Paul A. North, who did not respond to requests for comment, did not confirm whether any of the five code-copying cases came from Yale’s CS50 course. In total, the committee accused 24 Yale undergraduates of violating the college’s rules on academic integrity—dozens fewer cases than those arising from CS50 at Harvard alone.
The spate of academic dishonesty cases from Harvard's CS50 course has stretched the Honor Council to its limits, and it took the body an unusually long time to hear many of the cases.
Of the five students examined by Yale’s Executive Committee, two had their charges withdrawn, while two others were reprimanded; the fifth’s outcome was not detailed in the report.
In the committee’s 2016 report, North wrote it was difficult to adjudicate cases involving collaboration in coding classes.
“Today there are new kinds of knowledge and new standards for what constitutes learning, and these are sometimes in conflict with the strong stance on academic dishonesty that the university most often rightly takes,” North wrote in the report. “One example of this is classes on coding.”
He added that coding classes demanded students “collaborate in various complex ways,” and “in some instances there are very few different ways to write the code.”
“Although instructors construct elaborate and scrupulous guidelines for students on the nitty gritty of what they can and cannot do on each assignment, despite all that care, it is often such a complex task to read these guidelines, that the code to be written seems simple in comparison,” North wrote.
North wrote that coding classes like CS50 might require “a different kind of standard” to judge inappropriate collaboration.
Some CS50 student at Harvard have criticized the course's collaboration policy as too vague.
CS50 sums up its policy on academic integrity as “be reasonable,” though roughly 20 former students and course staff at Harvard said it was sometimes difficult to determine exactly what that meant.
Patrick Rebeschini and Jason C. Hirschhorn ’14, CS50 course instructors at Yale, both declined to comment for this story. More than a dozen former CS50 course staff members at Yale also declined to comment.
Hirschhorn sent an email to Yale students reminding them of CS50’s media policy, which asks students to redirect media requests from “non-Yale-affiliated media (such as the Harvard Crimson)” to himself and Rebeschini.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A new course at Harvard Business School, “Black Business Leaders and Entrepreneurship,”  focuses on case studies featuring black protagonists in an effort to address a “blatant absence of inclusion” in the school’s curriculum.
Steven S. Rogers, the Business School professor who started the course, said the motivation for starting the course wasn’t to discuss racial discrimination, but rather to tell the stories of successful black business executives.
“One of the things I decided to do was not make it a course that focused on problems, but a course that focused on solutions and the end product of success,” he said.
Beyond moving the Business School curriculum towards including more diverse case protagonists, Rogers said he wants to showcase examples of “black brilliance.”
According to Rogers, Business School students read very few case studies featuring black protagonists, and Rogers had to write several cases himself to teach the course.
In the first-year Business School curriculum, students read around three hundred cases; of those three hundred, only three usually feature black protagonists, Rogers said. Of the roughly ten thousand cases the Business School has ever published, Rogers said he found only seventy cases that focused on a black protagonist.
“There was really a need for me to create new content,” he said. In the past year, Rogers said he has written or co-written 14 original cases featuring black protagonists.
The course has been unexpectedly popular within Harvard.
Rogers said he expected an enrollment of around 25 students. But 43 ultimately signed up to take the course, and Rogers said that the students came from seven out of Harvard’s twelve schools, including the Business School, Law School, and the College, in addition to MIT.
“It was overenrolled, oversubscribed, and the students come from eight different schools,” he said. “I don’t believe there’s another course on campus under the Harvard umbrella that has such wonderful diversity of students from all of the different schools.”
Michael K. Bervell ’19, the only undergraduate enrolled in Rogers’s course, said the class had a broad appeal.
“Even if you’re not a Business School student, you can still contribute,” Bervell said. “Even though the course wasn’t just a business student’s course, it still functioned very well because of Professor Rogers’ great teaching style.”
Rogers said he thinks the high University-wide demand for his course is indicative of a wider desire for similar courses that promote inclusivity.
“Students in other parts of the schools are coming, and their schedules don’t fit, but they’re forcing their schedules to fit, so there’s a desperate need for this kind of content,” he said.
He also added that he thinks the diversity of schools represented “personifies one Harvard.”
Rogers’ long-term goal, however, is to do away with the need for a class like “Black Business Leaders.”
“The ideal is that there won’t be a need for my course. If we have black protagonists in the entire curriculum, then you don’t to have a course like this. But we have to do it, we don’t have it now,” he said.
