After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lawrence S. Bacow began work as Harvard’s 29th president on Monday, and to mark the occasion, the Boston Globe ran an article titled “Lawrence Bacow promises a more outward-looking Harvard.” The article discusses his recent focus on higher education as one national institution: After leaving Tufts, he toured the country speaking about higher education, met with college presidents, and wrote about college teaching. As president, he has already met with other Boston-area universities to discuss collaboration. The article paraphrases a former George Washington University president: “Higher education needs a champion right now.” And who better than Bacow, president of America’s wealthiest and most famous university, who has spent his life in university leadership?
If Bacow is now higher education’s champion, his nemesis—excluding the increasingly hostile Republican Party—might be Bryan Caplan. An economics professor at George Mason, Caplan recently published a book—“The Case Against Education”—that raises strong empirical challenges to the conventional wisdom that appears in the refrains of Bacow, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, and university administrators everywhere.
Caplan’s core argument is that education, after imparting essential and productive skills like reading and algebra, proceeds to waste enormous resources, including students’ time and public budgets, teaching skills students will never use and facts they will never remember. What, then, accounts for graduates’ higher earnings? The “sheepskin effect,” named for the original material of diplomas. That is, rather than raising your actual human capital, a bachelor’s degree serves as a signal to employers of your pre-existing intelligence, work ethic, and conformity.
Caplan details the methodology and public policy implications in interviews with liberal-technocratic Vox and 80,000 Hours, but I’d like to consider his research more narrowly: If very little of what we learn at Harvard turns out to be useful or productive, how disturbed should students and administrators be, and what should we do differently?
Our alarm should depend on a couple things. First, our major: Engineers learn more productive things in college than, say, English concentrators, with my economics-infused Social Studies degree falling somewhere in between. Before you call me or Caplan a philistine for ignoring the beauty and life-enhancing power of literature, note that Caplan’s view of “useful and productive” extends beyond the economic sense. In his last chapter, he convincingly argues that insofar as schools are supposed to “elevate the human personality[,] refine our tastes, and make us into intrinsically better human beings,” there’s little evidence that they do, and we should avoid giving schools “credit for good intentions.”
“There’s two things that make sense to do,” Caplan said in an interview with The Crimson, after I quoted the Harvard College mission (“to educate the citizens and citizen-leaders for our society … through our commitment to the transformative power of a liberal arts and sciences education”).
“One is teach people stuff that’s useful, something they would use for a job or other practical task," he said. "Or, teach them something that’s actually interesting or inspiring to them.”
The policy most directly informed by the College’s mission might be the torturously still-evolving General Education program. Despite its continued simplification, it still reaches beyond Caplan’s reasonable criteria. The new policy, essentially a distribution requirement, still requires people to take courses they have no interest in taking. The College still demands a faint familiarity with a foreign language, which Caplan called “especially ridiculous,” since very few adults even claim to speak fluently the language they took in college.
The “ethical reasoning” requirement persists, and Caplan is especially skeptical of the idea that classrooms can instill ethics. “Here’s one good test: Take a look at professional philosophers, people who study ethics for many years, generally. Or you narrow it down to professional ethicists,” he said. “There has been a bit of work on whether they actually behave more ethically by any measure, and there’s not much sign of it.” Even if Harvard graduates in high-powered positions remember their ethical reasoning material five or twenty years into their careers (a doubtful prospect), will that intellectualized training actually change their behavior, if it can’t even do the same for ethicists?
Our alarm should also depend on how selfish we are. In some ways, Caplan describes his findings as “actually pretty comforting” for Harvard students. “Basically, it suggests that even if you don’t think that you’re learning very much, you should still expect a bright future.” But if you take seriously the Dexter Gate inscription, “Enter to grow in wisdom; Depart to better serve thy country and thy kind,” Caplan’s work should disturb you deeply. “You’ve put an enormous amount of energy into getting where you are, when … what you’re doing is really basically just redistributive,” Caplan said.
Rather than elevating our tastes and abilities, Harvard has merely reshuffled the deck of future employees—with its graduates closer to the top simply by virtue of the displacement of those at non-elite schools. If you’re a “socially conscious” student, Caplan added, “it’s disturbing to think that you’re really part of the problem here, and by trying to do really well in this educational rat race, you’re not doing anything to advance the interests of mankind or anything like it.”
In that sense, then, “The Case Against Education” should not only serve as a humbling reminder, as Bacow takes leadership of American higher education, to keep empirically testing our beliefs. It should also re-remind us, as our former president begins her job at Goldman Sachs, of our commitments to the rest of the world. Caplan’s argument, that universities teach us little in ethics or skills, bolsters that of Jin Park ’18 in his elegant Harvard Oration, that we do not morally deserve the great rewards that our sheepskin offers us. We can enjoy our status as beneficiaries of this zero-sum and somewhat arbitrary reshuffling, or we can dedicate at least some of our ensuing returns to elevating the whole deck. (To Caplan’s point, I’m four English classes in and still mixing metaphors.)

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The recent news regarding accusations of disadvantages for and discrimination against Asian-American applicants in the Harvard admissions process has put several students in scenarios where they must defend their admission to the College and prove why they deserve to be here. Constructed by Students for Fair Admissions as part of its lawsuit against Harvard, such allegations have provoked thoughts and conversations filled with do-I-belong-here's and did-I-get-here-solely-because-of-affirmative-action's, while catalyzing the growth of a credentialist culture where judgements of others and constructions of social hierarchies are based solely on accomplishments—all with little regard for individuals’ unique circumstances. The case revives a threat to future students of color and their chances of achieving higher education, on top of taking an emotional toll on students of color at Harvard.
Students for Fair Admissions has taken a firm stand against affirmative action and believes that “racial classifications and preferences in college admissions are unfair, unnecessary, and unconstitutional.” While I believe that consciousness of a student’s race in the college admissions process is fair, necessary, and constitutional, I further stand against SFFA because it is an organization that strives for color blindness. We are not searching for fairness through erasure of our identities and struggles—fairness never comes at such a cost.
Students for Fair Admissions seems to be looking to achieve something more extreme than what lays on the surface of this particular case. Edward Blum, president of SFFA, director of the Project on Fair Representation, and legal strategist in the Fisher v. University of Texas Supreme Court case, has been leading the fight against race conscious admissions and affirmative action for decades. As we question why Blum is choosing to target Asian and Asian-American students, why he’s doing it now, and what this has to do with his recent 2016 near-victory in the Fisher case, I haven’t a doubt that this case is a small part of a much larger plan to dismantle affirmative action entirely.
Blum pulls no new tricks here. The use of Asian Americans as political props is not a new tactic, and occurred during the 1980s against Stanford, Brown, and other top schools. It is a clear cut example of racial mascoting and exploitation of another social groups’ struggle for the benefit of one’s own. While in no way aiming to invalidate or ignore the struggle Asians, Asian Americans, and other groups face—one can only ask that as we grow to understand each other’s struggles and oppressions, completed through greater levels of diversity, I might add, that privilege is recognized and institutionalized oppressions are not negated and nullified in the process.
Affirmative action stands as an imperfect policy. It disproportionately benefits white women and favors upper-middle class students of color. Many students, including myself, would also say it does not give enough attention to economic and socioeconomic class. Nevertheless, it is the only policy currently addressing the institutionalized and systematic oppressions students from marginalized communities—especially students of color—face in achieving higher education. Our world, our schools, and our role models would be and look different without it.
If we were to picture a Harvard that didn’t recognize these challenges in the admissions process, a Harvard without affirmative action, what would it look like? Well, with affirmative action, adapted by many institutions with the passing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the admitted class of 2020 was the first one to be majority-minority. It took 53 years of affirmative action at work for underrepresented groups to collectively represent a majority—by just over one percent.
If Harvard were to admit individuals based solely on academic successes such as grades, SAT or ACT scores, and class rankings, based on a reported Harvard model from 2013, the percentage of Asians that make up the class would more than double to 43 percent. This number may be even higher as the rate of admission for Asian Americans has grown 29 percent over the last 10 years. Keeping this in mind, the gap between white students and students of color is still quite wide when it comes to one of the most important traditional indicators of academic success—standardized tests. Thus, the percentage of white students enrolled at Harvard would most likely remain high, and might even increase. Under this scenario, little room, if any, would seem to be left for Brown and Black students. A Harvard like this would accept students based on test scores and GPAs that are poor indicators of merit, especially for Black, Latinx, and Native American students, which are influenced by implicit biases teachers have about students of color.
Harvard, among many other colleges and universities, prides itself on the communities it bridges and relationships it cultivates. Without diversity, exposure to different and underrepresented perspectives, and recognition of the hurdles students overcome, Harvard is, and many colleges would be, a room full of mirrors; an echo chamber which never sees change as a product of dialogue.
For this reason, the Black Student Association has worked with NAACP lawyers to collect narratives and voices of Harvard students regarding affirmative action and the overall positive impact it has had on the student body in order to assist in the construction of an amicus brief.
The BSA stands with those who support affirmative action. Together, we stand against Students for Fair Admissions as in their fight for color blindness in higher education, we strive to be seen, we strive to be heard, and we strive to have ourselves and journeys recognized while helping others do the same.

Correction: July 10, 2018
A previous version of this op-ed incorrectly stated that the Class of 2021 is Harvard's first majority-minority class. In fact, the admitted class of 2021 is the second class in a row to be majority non-white. The College has yet to  seat a freshman class that is majority nonwhite.
