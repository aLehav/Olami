After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Annabel O’Hagan ’19 is one of the first women to join the Hasty Pudding cast, marking a milestone for Harvard’s oldest annual theater production that has only casted male actors for nearly 200 years. After the Pudding went co-ed this past year, O’Hagan joined five other talented actresses who earned roles in the drag show performance that will premiere this coming spring in Cambridge, New York, and Bermuda. While this will be her first Hasty Pudding show, O’Hagan has performed in a variety of other Harvard productions throughout her time at Harvard as part of the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club. She played the leading role in the past fall production of Harvard College Musical Theater’s “Chicago” and will be performing in HRDC’s “Romeo and Juliet.”
The Harvard Crimson: Tell us a little bit about your involvement in theater pre-Hasty.
Annabel O’Hagan: I’ve been doing HRDC shows since my freshman year. I started out doing a lot of musicals. My first show was “Nine: The Musical,” and since then my interest in theater has really grown in different areas. I started out doing only musical theater in high school and when I got here, I started reading some plays I really fell in love with and then doing straight theater as well. So my junior year I ended up doing only plays, which was really great, and, after this semester I will have done ten HRDC shows. Right now I’m in “Romeo and Juliet.” I am actually playing the nurse. If you know me, it’s not really a type casting role, but if you know me really well, then you know that it kind of works. I love that I am getting to play a character that is so bold and goofy.
I finished “Chicago” before that, which was absolutely incredible. It’s probably been one of my favorite shows I did at Harvard. I played Roxie in high school. “Chicago” was one of the first shows in high school that got me interested in musical theater and now it’s one of the last shows I did in college. So it’s been really great to see how much I’ve grown since then. I am also on the board of the Harvard College Musical Association which is sort of a newer theatrical group on campus that has been really fun because we put on cabarets and shows that are meant to engage the community and get them excited about musical theater in a less competitive way. The cabarets that we do are non-audition based so anyone can sign up to perform, so that has been really fulfilling as well.
THC: What do you find special about Hasty Pudding, how is it different from past shows you’ve been part of?
AO: Hasty Pudding is absolutely going to be a blast because the style is so big. I really love doing big crazy roles and Hasty is the perfect environment for that. I think what's really fun about it is that it's an opportunity to go absolutely all in on comedy which is something I’ve really loved doing at Harvard. Another thing that’s really cool about Hasty is that it’s so collaborative, the writers, Michael Perusse ’20 and Max Weiss ’20 have been working with us the past couple weeks in finessing the scripts and hearing us doing lines and tweaking them specifically for us to see how we deliver them. The show is really formed and partly crafted around the performers themselves, which is such an incredible position to be in. And the writers are just hilarious. It’s going to be a really good show.
THC: Speaking of collaborating with other students in the Hasty Pudding, how do you think including women has changed the Hasty Pudding?
AO: I think people expected it to change Hasty Pudding more than it actually did. Any critiques about adding women to the cast would say it’s ruining this drag tradition which is so central to the theatricals, but we’re still keeping the drag aspect. Half of the women are dressing up as men and half of the men are dressing up as women. So half the cast will be keeping up the drag tradition which is very similar to past years for Hasty Pudding. I think what’s really cool about the addition of women is that when you opened up the casting call to women, you opened up the room to a lot more talent as well. I think what is really incredible about the women in the cast is that they are triple threats. I feel so lucky to be among these other girls: All of them are the best singers, dancers, and actors I know on campus. So I think the Hasty Pudding show only can get better by opening up their talent pool.
THC: Are you interested in pursuing acting after graduation?
AO: Yes, I am planning on moving to New York after graduation and living the actor life which is really scary — it's a really scary lifestyle, but if you work hard enough and if you get lucky, I think the benefits of it absolutely outweigh the costs.
Correction: Nov. 28, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the number of women who earned positions as Hasty Pudding cast members this year. It is six, not five.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During finance and consulting recruiting season, I received an email from a different type of recruiter, one from Teach for America. The associate from TFA explained that she had stumbled upon my name on LinkedIn and thought that my work “partnering with a professor to deliver high quality academic content to students” made me a suitable candidate for applying. The email intrigued me, not because I want to do TFA next year, but because it made me think about how programs find and train future teachers.
Recruiting unqualified 21 year-olds with no prior classroom experience via cold emails to teach in low-income schools is a fundamentally flawed approach — and one that highlights the debilitating variability in teacher training across the US. TFA accounts for only one of many routes for entering teaching. With these different routes comes a wide variety of training that teachers receive before entering a classroom. That should not be the case. Instead, all teachers, regardless of background, should be provided standard and extensive instructional training before they work in the classroom to better understand what methods most effectively help students learn.
Teachers used to be certified only upon the successful completion of a college undergraduate program. However, today there exist over 2,000 different programs for teacher certification through alternate routes, such as TFA, that are growing in size. There is now wide variability for teacher preparation programs, and the disparities in the quality of these programs is exacerbated by a lack of minimum standards or regulatory oversight.
Different teacher preparation programs emphasize particular instructional methods. Research from Kirschner, Sweller, and Clark shows the ineffectiveness of minimally guided techniques such as discovery, problem-based, experiential, and inquiry-based teaching. There have also been varied results in the effectiveness of explicit instruction. The efficacy of any teaching method ultimately comes down to the teacher and the type of institutional knowledge and training the teacher is supported by.
Although TFA has noble intentions, its philosophy of recruiting recent college graduates from a wide array of disciplines to teach only serves to perpetuate the issues produced by the lack of standardized teacher training. In 2006, Boyd et al. examined the recent push to lower the requirements for teaching in order to bring teachers with a more diverse set of backgrounds into the classroom. Using data from New York, they separated teachers by their pathways into the profession, and found that new teachers, especially in their first year of teaching, are relatively less effective and negatively impact students’ learning outcomes. These teachers may lack the training or experience needed to solve instructional problems in real time. Using data from Houston, Darling-Hammond et al. found in 2005 that untrained teachers are disproportionately more likely to teach at-risk minority and low-income students, and that students under the guidance of TFA teachers perform significantly worse on standardized tests. The authors also advocate that more needs to be done for teacher preparation.
These differences in training have real impacts on students — not only on the day-to-day effects of what students learn in the classroom, but also on students’ test scores, achievement marks, and even potentially the trajectories of their lives. I know that I will forever remember Mr. Siddiqui, my high school math teacher, and the way he made me want to excel in class because of the personal connection he formed with his students. Although he took a nonconventional route to teaching, he was effective at his job because of the training he received. Now he trains other high school calculus teachers on how to connect with their students from the very first day they walk into the classroom. We must take teaching our teachers more seriously by creating a universal system of training; after all, they are teaching the future of our country.
Though critics may argue that standardizing teacher instruction will take away the individuality of teachers, that is not the intention. A teacher’s individual personality is still needed for teachers to connect and grow close with their students. When teachers can make their lessons relevant to their individual students, performance for those students increases. This standard system would serve as a common starting point for teachers, one that they could adapt to match their personality and classroom environment.
Teaching is an incredibly difficult profession; to teach well requires a certain combination of talent, temperament, and training, especially given the myriad ways in which students of different backgrounds learn. But in today’s educational system, our classrooms are too often staffed by teachers who have the right talent and temperament but lack the right training — a situation which fails to set students up for success, personally and academically. We must ensure that all teachers, especially those who enter the profession through an alternate route, receive standardized training that enables them to understand how and why students learn the way they do.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Freshman fall marked my first encounter with the study of economics. I barely understood anything from the textbook I occasionally read and the problem sets I passed only by the grace of God. The authority with which my classmates spoke convinced me that the population of idiot island was one: me. I wondered: Had everyone taken microeconomics before? Or was their command of entirely new academic territory a signal of my accidental admission here?
In pursuit of these answers, I decided to listen more closely. Beneath throwing around key terms, arguing with professors as a fresh-out-the-womb 18-year-old, and inflection that suggested they knew supply and demand curves like old friends, I heard nothing. From a few skims of an overpriced N. Greg Mankiw textbook, I could discern that half the time, what they were saying didn’t even make sense. Therein lies the first lesson from the elite liberal arts education: It is possible to speak without saying anything at all. At best, doing so is an interesting party trick; at worst, it’s a crucial and unfortunate tenet of what I deem “Harvard debate culture.”
Harvard debate culture is what happens when you gather a bunch of former prize-winning high school debaters, kids no one really liked growing up, and other lovable rascals who believe that disagreeing with everything for argument’s sake is a captivating personality trait. When you constantly tell them they’re smart(er than everyone else), their self-worth becomes dependent on that precarious belief. Surrounded by other imps who grew accustomed to the self-satisfaction that comes from perpetually holding the title of “smartest one in the room,” their insecurities and external motivations demand they find ways to distinguish themselves once again.
Sections are where the greater debaters go to relive the high school glory days and where productive or fulfilling conversations go to die. Take a graduate student who’s just trying to get their degree and undergraduates who don’t understand that having a thought doesn’t necessitate you share it and you’ve got an hour to fill with comments that are likely better left unsaid (aha!).
Our “counter-culture” manifests in a multitude of ways, three chief among them: rambling to fill space, over-intellectualizing everything, and provoking conflict for conflict’s sake. All routes offer endless possibilities for flexing the creative argumentative muscles. For the first, talk for as long as you can. Insert yourself into the conversation whenever possible. The more you can repeat what someone else in the room has already said — particularly if that person was a woman — the better. You’re welcome to piggyback off a previous comment, but noting that you disagree with a comment, regardless your argument’s substance, is the jackpot in your contrarian lottery.
The hyper-analytical debater can choose quite literally anything as an object of analysis. The author’s intention is of no concern; you’re more knowledgeable than they ever could be anyway. Choose a string of words in a random chapter or an inkblot in the acknowledgements section. Interpret their meaning as if they were the subject-expertise of your entire undergraduate degree.
The classmates of the debater-provocateur love a hot take, and their teaching fellow doesn’t get paid to quell controversy in the classroom anyway. Therefore, why not go after a marginalized group: Ask the group whether they deserve to exist or suffer! No hot take is off-limits when provocation is the aim of the game.
For all three paths, affect is crucial. Your tone, facial expression, and politician-like eye contact with classmates cannot betray the slightest wavering of belief in what you’re saying. As a performer of knowledge, you must commit to your role.
And perhaps that’s the problem with Harvard debate culture, that we exchange ideas for the sake of entertaining or proving some image of ourselves to our classmates. Of course it’s normal to fudge understanding, speak with undue confidence, or talk from our rear ends sometimes. But when these tricks become our dominant mode of discourse, we misuse the power of our words, the skills our education has given us, and the responsibility that comes with a Harvard degree.
It’s a reality that people might listen to us just because of where we earned our degree. Sure, we could just be the esteemed contrarian at dinner parties, but that’d be an insult to our own collegiate efforts.
Instead of serving as the advocate the devil doesn’t need, we could attempt to familiarize ourselves with subjects before we offer opinions. We could advocate for important things like prison abolition and health care reform rather than attend to causes and viewpoints whose relevance is limited to momentary debate performance.
If those options lack appeal, we don’t have to get rid of our outrageous analyses or tendency to arouse; we can just keep our ideas to ourselves. We might benefit from following the words of Kendrick Lamar, who would advise us to “Sit down, Be humble.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Nov. 6, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos released a new set of federal guidelines under consideration that some experts say may force Harvard to alter its current Title IX policy. The proposed guidelines for handling campus sexual assault seek to increase the rights of the accused and protect colleges from greater liability by limiting the definition of sexual harassment. These guidelines have fallen under scrutiny for treating university disciplinary proceedings like a courtroom, allowing cross-examination, permitting colleges to raise the evidentiary standard for sexual misconduct, and making the definition of sexual harassment more restrictive.
Sexual assault is one of the most devastating crimes that can be inflicted upon members of our community. It is also one of the most ignored. One in five women will be sexually assaulted during her time in college and over 90 percent of sexual assault victims on college campuses do not report what happened to them. The stakes of this issue could not be higher, and thus we are deeply concerned by the ramifications of these new guidelines.
DeVos seems to be operating under the assumption that there is an epidemic of false allegations plaguing America. To combat this apparent crisis, her proposed guidelines will give schools the option of raising the standard of proof from a "preponderance of evidence" to a "clear and convincing" one. The Department of Education will also only hold schools accountable for responding to formally filed complaints and violations that occurred on campus.
Yet the problem with campus sexual violence was never the number of malicious students running around plotting who to accuse next. We do not mean to be flippant — stories of students’ lives ruined by false allegations are heartbreaking. Yet we also know of these stories because they are so rare and often make headlines whenever they occur. These anecdotes are used to drown out thousands of devastating stories of sexual trauma. Both stories matter. Yet DeVos is missing the proverbial forest of genuine allegations for a few crooked trees.
We are sympathetic to the concern that accused students’ due process rights have been violated. Yet we refuse to buy into the paranoia that this has reached epidemic proportions. Indeed, only between two and 10 percent of sexual assault allegations are false. There are extensive barriers which prevent victims from disclosing their assault, such as societal scrutiny, fear of reliving the assault, and investigators that blame the victim. DeVos’s proposed guidelines threaten to raise these barriers to insurmountable heights, sacrificing victims’ security to fight the too-often fictional scourge of false allegations.
Indeed, Harvard should most fundamentally prioritize the rights and safety of victims. We disapprove of the use of cross-examination in the context of University disciplinary proceedings for sexual misconduct. This would only serve to worsen the trauma of victims and put them under pressure.
Yet though we are concerned by the policies proposed by DeVos, we also know — pending a required notice-and-comment period — Harvard will have an obligation to obey them. We thus call upon the University to do everything in its power to protect students, even if this requires going above and beyond the expectations imposed upon it by the Trump administration.
For example, Harvard should set the standard of evidence for cases of sexual misconduct to be the previous preponderance of evidence. By choosing to adhere to this standard, Harvard can best balance the concerns of upholding due process and protecting survivors. Harvard should also hold itself accountable for providing academic accommodations to any survivor who requests it, even if DeVos’s standards place no such expectation on universities.
If DeVos has placed a newfound emphasis on the protection of perpetrators’ rights, then Harvard must make its commitment to survivors’ rights equally clear. These two interests must not be framed as incompatible or in conflict. Harvard now must undertake the difficult but essential task of balancing the two so that all students can freely enjoy its resources, absent the specter of sexual assault.

Jane Britton ’67 was studying at Harvard as a graduate student when she was bludgeoned to death in her apartment in 1969 — and on Nov. 20, just months from the 50th anniversary of the murder, the Middlesex County District Attorney’s Office announced they had identified a suspect in the case.
The possible perpetrator is Michael Sumpter, a man the District Attorney’s Office dubbed a “career criminal” in a press release last week. Sumpter died of cancer in 2001 after spending years in prison for committing rape in 1975. He has been posthumously linked to five sexual assaults, three of which also involved the murder of the victim.
Britton's murder took place early on a 1960s January morning. She had spent the previous night out with her boyfriend and several other Harvard classmates; the group ate at the Acropolis Restaurant, after which the couple went ice skating at Cambridge Common.
Shortly after Britton returned to her apartment, she was sexually assaulted and hit with a blunt instrument until she died. Her boyfriend found her body the next day.
The District Attorney’s Office wrote in its press release that it is likely Sumpter entered through a window, committed the crime, and fled the scene. Middlessex County investigators said they made headway in the decades-old mystery via new DNA testing and analysis; it is the oldest cold case prosecutors have ever solved.
District Attorney Marian Ryan said in the press release she has few doubts that Sumpter — a man with no previous connection to Britton — is the culprit.
“Today I am confident that the mystery of who killed Jane Britton has finally been solved and this case is officially closed,” Ryan said in the release.
Britton was a graduate student of anthropology who specialized in Near Eastern archeology. A Crimson article published immediately after the murder noted Britton's friends described her as “attractive and extremely talented.” At the time of her death, she had already completed anthropological research in France and Iran.
Rebecca A. Cooper ’10, a former New Yorker staff writer currently working on a book about Britton's life and death, said many people involved with the case assumed the perpetrator had also boasted ties to the Harvard anthropology department.
“There were elements of the crime scene which looked like a recreation of a burial ritual,” Cooper said. “People thought that it was a direct reference to things that she was studying or that were being taught in class.”
Now, though, the crime appears to be what Cooper called a “brutality of randomness.”
Because Sumpter is already dead, his identification as a suspect will have few direct ramifications. Cooper noted, though, that finally getting some answers may still provide comfort to Britton’s surviving family.
“I think there is solace in not having given up,” Cooper said. “After 50 years, they may not have closure — but they do have, hopefully, the mystery taken out of the horror.”
Most of Britton's close relatives are dead, but her bother — a vicar at a church in California — wrote in an email to the Boston Globe that "learning to understand and forgive remains a challenge."
“A half century of mystery and speculation has clouded the brutal crime that shattered Jane's promising young life and our family," Britton wrote. “As the surviving Britton, I wish to thank all those — friends, public officials and press — who persevered in keeping this investigation active, most especially State Police Sergeant Peter Sennott. The DNA evidence may be all we ever have as a conclusion."

Researchers across Harvard face a difficult climate when funding their research. Federal research funding, long a mainstay of academic institutions, has been largely stagnant in recent years. Institutional support from Harvard, while present, will never fully meet the needs of often-expensive medical and public health research.
At the Harvard School of Public Health, professors are taking a different path to supporting their research. In increasing numbers, they are turning to private corporations for funding and assistance.
While this arrangement offers a new source of much-needed funding, it also raises challenging ethical and management questions for the school.
Michelle A. Williams, dean of the School of Public Health, said last month that she aims to ensure Harvard faculty can compete for outside awards.
“Only about 15 percent of our revenue comes from our endowment. So one of the strategies for the school of the previous dean and myself is to keep our high competitive position for sponsored research [and] work to continue to diversify our funding streams,” she said.
Across the University, faculty received $45.8 million in research funding from corporations and $154.8 million from private foundations in fiscal year 2017, according to data from the University’s Office for Sponsored Programs. These figures have increased 16 percent and 45 percent since 2013, respectively.
Federal funding, on the other hand, has slumped in the same time period, down about 4 percent.
The school has taken on two large corporate-sponsored research projects in the last year.
Last spring, Aetna and the school announced a partnership to examine employee happiness and health.
Tyler J. VanderWeele, an epidemiology professor at the School of Public Health, cited the employee data that Aetna would make available as a major draw to the partnership. Employees will voluntarily take surveys over five years, the results of which Harvard researchers will analyze.
“It was clear almost from the beginning that this was going to be a good match with regard to interest and the potential for research,” VanderWeele said. “We’ll have quite an extraordinary and rich well-being data research resource.”
In June, the University's Office for Sustainability and the School of Public Health joined with Google on a project to test the toxicity of chemicals frequently used in construction.
At the time, Heather Henriksen, managing director of the office, said Google was a natural partner for Harvard because of their similar square footages, governance structures, and interests in transparency.
Experts say this type of corporate-sponsored research offers an opportunity for additional funding, but can raise difficult administrative and ethical issues.
The most obvious upside is financial. In a time when federal funding is less certain than before for academic institutions, corporate sponsors can help fill the gap.
Nicholas H. Steneck, who directs a research ethics center at the University of Michigan, said faculty typically turn to corporate-sponsored projects in order to secure funding.
“It’s just another source of funding. Government funds are limited; they haven’t been increasing. Most institutions don’t have a lot of money to fund research,” Steneck said, because they primarily direct funds to student financial aid and other expenses.
“They’re always looking for more funding, and industry is an obvious place,” he added.
The Aetna partnership, for example, came with several million dollars of funding for Harvard, although the company and the faculty involved declined to give an exact figure, citing confidentiality agreements.
There are also, however, complications that sometimes arise with these arrangements.
C.K. Gunslaus, director of the National Center for Professional and Research Ethics, cited intellectual property concerns as often arising in sponsored research partnerships.
“Most universities have a set of guidelines about what intellectual property terms are acceptable from a sponsor of research,” she said. “Particularly if students are involved, the general rule of thumb is that it should be publishable."
Steneck said there are relatively few government regulations in place addressing ethical concerns related to corporate-sponsored research.
“Most privately funded research doesn’t fall under government regulations. The only exception to that is medical research that has to be submitted to the FDA for approval,” he said.
The School of Public Health, and the University more broadly, have hundreds of pages of policies in place concerning sponsored research.
The school’s conflict of interest policy, for example, specifically mentions that research sponsors should not have undue influence on scholarly findings.
“Faculty members must not be induced by financial interests to give outside sponsors or other organizations or individuals authority to direct their studies or to restrict or unreasonably delay the release or publication of research results,” the policy reads.
School policy also governs information sharing between professors and sponsors: Faculty cannot share confidential information with sponsors more than 30 days before planned publication.
In September 2001, the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, set out University-wide policies for collaboration and commercial enterprises, noting the opportunities for corporate-sponsored research.
“At the same time, commercial activities can pose risks to the core values of universities, notably to their commitment to pursue and disseminate knowledge independent of economic and other extraneous pressures,” the policy reads.
The Corporation mentioned public trust as one of the most important factors for the University to consider in evaluating projects.
“The University should therefore scrutinize with special care any agreement that may appear to compromise public trust, even if University officials believe the arrangement does not otherwise jeopardize the integrity of teaching or research,” it stated.
Michael J. Grusby, executive dean for administration at the School of Public Health, could not be reached for an interview for this story.
Earlier this year, conflict of interest questions received national attention next door at the Harvard Medical School.
A Medical School researcher’s trial came under investigation and was then shut down by the National Institutes of Health after he was found to have wooed industry funds with promises that he would find positive health effects of moderate alcohol consumption.

After a Harvard Law student-led boycott of Kirkland & Ellis, the law firm announced last week it would no longer require associates to sign mandatory arbitration agreements — contracts that require employees to resolve workplace disputes with employers through an arbitration process, rather than through the courts.
Kirkland & Ellis, the world’s highest-grossing law firm, announced the decision in a memorandum sent to all employees last Wednesday.
“Following a recent review, the Firm Committee has determined that the Firm will no longer require arbitration of any employment disputes that may be brought by associates or summer associates,” the memo stated.
The Pipeline Parity Project — a Law School student group whose mission is “to end harassment and discrimination in the legal profession” — called for the boycott in a statement posted to their website on Nov. 12. The statement included an annotated copy of an arbitration agreement that an associate at the firm was forced to sign this year and told law students to avoid the firm until they removed the mandatory agreements.
“Don’t interview with Kirkland & Ellis until they promise to stop making any of their employees—no associate, paralegal, custodian, or contractor—sign these coercive contracts,” the statement reads.
The Pipeline Parity Project also organized protests at the Law School during the contentious Supreme Court nomination of Brett M. Kavanaugh, who taught at the school for roughly a decade. The group called on the school to bar him from teaching and organized a walkout and rally. The school announced in October that the embattled nominee would not return to teach his winter class in January. Kavanaugh was ultimately confirmed to the Court.
In their effort to pressure Kirkland & Ellis to remove mandatory arbitration agreements from associate contracts, the student group relied on a Twitter campaign using the hashtag #DumpKirkland.
Alexandra V. Kohnert-Yount, a second-year Law student and member of the Pipeline Parity Project, said she was “pleasantly surprised” that the firm changed their policy so quickly after the boycott began.
“Never doubt that a week’s worth of tweets can make a big law firm change their 10-year-old policy,” Kohnert-Yount said.
Last April, a group of Law students wrote an open letter calling on the school to ensure that law firms who recruit on campus “protect the rights of their employees” to come forward and seek legal action if they “experience harassment, discrimination, or workplace abuse.”
Then in May, Harvard and dozens of other law schools announced that they would require firms that recruit on campus to disclose whether they require summer associates to sign mandatory arbitration agreements or non-disclosure agreements. Those schools then sent a survey to 374 law firms asking whether they require summer associates to sign the agreements; almost half of the firms declined to answer.
Second-year Law student and Pipeline Parity Project member Molly M. E. Coleman said that the Kirkland & Ellis boycott is not the end of the group’s activism on arbitration agreements. Coleman, who helped organize the April letter, said the group is planning to organize protests against other firms with the controversial contract provisions.
“I think that in the next few days there will be more about which ones we plan to target next and which ones we have the most concrete information on,” Coleman said.

Negotiators for Harvard’s graduate student union wrote in an email to their fellow members Tuesday that there is “a great deal of distance” between their bargaining proposals and the University’s — a gap they say only additional negotiations will bridge.
The email asked the union’s 5,000-plus members to sign a petition calling on administrators to schedule more half-day bargaining sessions. The email came on the heels of the union's third bargaining session with Harvard held this semester.
“We have become concerned that the administration’s slow approach to bargaining will jeopardize our ability to reach agreement on a fair contract in a timely manner,” the petition reads.
The union has offered the University 11 additional dates for sessions in January, according to the email.
HGSU-UAW entered negotiations with an ambitious list of goals totaling 80 items. In an earlier email updating union rank-and-file members, bargaining committee members reported that meeting those goals will likely be an uphill battle. Negotiators took issue with University counterproposals surrounding sexual harassment procedures, among other things.
The email and the accompanying petition both reference a host of goals including changes to Harvard’s handling of sexual misconduct allegations. The committee wrote that, while negotiations continue, the graduate and undergraduate students who voted to unionize last semester go without “fair, improved, and stable conditions.”
“Every day that goes by without an agreement is another day where student workers feel we lack fair recourse on sexual harassment or discrimination, lack job security, are often paid late, or only have access to prohibitively expensive dental insurance,” the petition reads.
The University’s current suggestion is that Harvard and HGSU-UAW’s bargaining teams meet every other week in sessions lasting around five hours until they reach an agreement, University spokesperson Melodie Jackson wrote in an email. Under that proposal, the two sides would meet separately on the off weeks to review proposals and collect feedback.
In an October email to students, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 wrote that University administrators anticipate the negotiation process will be “time-consuming.”
Harvard is one of a small handful of private universities — including Brandeis University, Tufts University, New York University, and Columbia University — that have agreed to formally negotiate with their students. Other universities have pursued varying timelines when negotiating contracts.
At Brandeis, negotiations lasted around 10 months, while a 2015 NYU contract took 18 months. In a recent proposed framework for bargaining, Columbia estimated that contract negotiations would take 14 months. Harvard’s negotiation process could prove even more complicated due to the complexity and unprecedented size of the bargaining unit.
Until the University and the union ratify a contract, the graduate and undergraduate teaching and research assistants included in HGSU-UAW’s bargaining unit will not see the raises and benefits organizers have long sought in their five-year campaign to unionize — a fact HGSU-UAW highlighted in its petition.
Jackson wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard is “committed to engaging in a process that is efficient and thorough.”
“The work of negotiations is a mixture of time at the table and preparation for negotiations away from the table. It requires sufficient time to examine the impact of proposals and counter proposals and to obtain important feedback and ideas from our constituencies, which include our 12 schools,” she wrote. “The University is actively engaged in this work on a weekly basis but it is important to remember we are starting from scratch and care must be taken in drafting contractual language.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Days after electing Economics professor Roland G. Fryer, Jr. to a high-ranking administrative post in October, the American Economic Association released a statement noting it had become aware of harassment allegations leveled against one of its officers.
The AEA announced in fall 2018 that it was adding Fryer — along with four other top economists including former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen — to the 2019 iteration of its Executive Committee. The AEA, founded in 1885 for the “encouragement of economic research” and “encouragement of perfect freedom of economic discussion,” is a prestigious professional association for economists in academia, government, and the private sector, according to its website. Numerous Nobel laureates in economics number among its past officers.
The Crimson reported in May that Fryer is being investigated separately by Harvard and the state of Massachusetts over allegations of sexual harassment brought by at least two women. Lawyers for one of the complainants alleged in a statement at the time that Fryer had committed “egregious” acts of verbal sexual harassment targeting their client. The attorneys also alleged that the professor “objectified and sexualized” female staffers in his lab.
Fryer, a rising star in the Harvard Economics department before the allegations surfaced, repeatedly denied all charges of misconduct in a May interview with The Crimson. He did not respond to requests for comment for this article.
In the Oct. 15 statement — which was signed by the 2018 Executive Committee — the AEA wrote that it recently learned one of its elected candidates is facing accusations of “creating a hostile work environment.”
Though the statement did not name Fryer, it almost certainly refers to him. None of the other four recently elected AEA officers currently face public allegations of harassment. And Robert J. Shiller, a Nobel laureate and Yale professor who headed the AEA in 2016, said in an interview last week that members of the AEA sent messages detailing the allegations against Fryer over an internal email list earlier this fall.
“We take such allegations seriously, but they are, at this point, just allegations,” the AEA statement reads. “While the home institution will neither deny nor confirm the existence of an investigation, we understand that one is underway, and may come to some conclusions in the not too distant future.”
“We have decided that, before proceeding further, we should wait for those conclusions, if they are made public and they come within a reasonable amount of time,” the statement continues.
Shiller said the committee released the statement because it “has standards of professionalism and dedication to principles that we want to uphold, especially on the board of directors of the organization.”
“I take it as something of a mission that economics serves the public,” Shiller said. “All the statement says in my mind is that we take complaints seriously, but we have no basis to act on anything at this time.”
Fryer is currently the subject of an investigation by Harvard’s Office for Dispute Resolution, which handles allegations of sexual and gender-based harassment in accordance with the University’s Title IX policy. Results of ODR investigations are generally not made public. Because Fryer is a faculty member, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay will receive ODR’s final report, and she will then decide whether to take action.
In the meantime, Harvard has already taken “interim measures” against Fryer. In March, the University forbade Fryer from entering EdLabs — the think tank he founded in 2008 to examine the economics of racial inequality — and appointed Executive Director of Harvard’s Center for African Studies Susan E. Cook interim executive director of the lab. Harvard also required that Fryer copy Cook on all emails he sends to EdLabs staff.
A Harvard internal directory still lists Cook as “Executive Director (FAS FCOR EdLabs Staff),” though her listed address is not in the Massachusetts Avenue building that houses EdLabs.
The outcome of the ODR investigation could ultimately result in punishments ranging from reprimand to dismissal. Only the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, can revoke a faculty member’s tenure.
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on the AEA’s statement and the status of the investigation into allegations against Fryer.
The results of the probe led by the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination — the state body investigating Fryer — could become public if state investigators find that the professor likely discriminated against members of EdLabs. MCAD would then launch a hearing process.
The Commission enforces Massachusetts anti-discrimination laws, which prohibit discrimination on the basis of “membership in a protected class, such as race, color, creed, national origin, age, disability, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, and more,” according to the MCAD website.
The potential results of the MCAD hearing range from dismissal of the complaint to imposition of damages against Fryer possibly amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars.
AEA officers on the Nominating Committee and the 2018 Executive Committee were unaware of the allegations against Fryer at the time of his nomination, according to the October statement. The AEA released its slate of potential candidates on April 27, before The Crimson reported the existence of the investigations into Fryer.
Voting in the election, however, opened on August 1 — roughly two months after The Crimson published its article.
“We also believe that few of the members knew of the allegations at the time of the election,” the AEA statement reads.
The AEA plans to ask all future potential nominees if they are the subject of an investigation.
“One conclusion we already draw is that, in the future, we shall ask potential nominees if they are the subject of an investigation. This will help avoid such situations going forward,” the statement reads.
The AEA declined to comment on its statement.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Native American Harvard affiliates spoke about feelings of “indigenous invisibility” on campus and potential solutions to the issue at a panel last Monday.
The event, co-hosted by Native Americans at Harvard College and the College Events Board, drew students and faculty across the University. Dubbed “We’re Still Here; A Discussion of Indigenous Invisibility at Harvard,” the panel centered on the personal experiences of some Native American Harvard affiliates who feel left out and overlooked in Cambridge.
Panel moderator and Executive Director of the Harvard University Native American Program Shelly C. Lowe said issues of invisibility needed to be addressed and overcome because of their potential effect on public representations of Native Americans.
“Invisibility leads to inaccurate and disrespectful representations of us in social media, in movies, in history books, and in curricular education,” she said.
Several of the panelists spoke about what they called the burden of having to prove their heritage. NAHC Secretary Kenard G. Dillon ’20 said this challenge often leads him to avoid identifying himself as Native American.
“I actively make myself invisible because a lot of times I don’t want to deal with it,” Dillon said.
Panelist and NAHC Vice President Anna Kate E. Cannon ’21 said indigenous students often get asked “what percentage” Native American they are.
“That tends to feel like an attack on my identity,” Cannon said. “It feels like I have to prove what I am; I have to prove that what I'm saying is worth listening to.”
Speakers at the event also discussed ways Harvard could be a better place for Native American students. Several panelists suggested the Univesity take action to more clearly acknowledge indigenous people’s presence both in the classroom and around campus.
Panelist and Ph.D. student Sarah A. Sadlier said she hoped Harvard would continue to hire Native American faculty members. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences hired its first-ever tenured professor in Native American studies, Philip J. Deloria, earlier this year.
Sadlier also pointed to the plaque on Matthews Hall in Harvard Yard, which marks where the Indian College stood, as a tribute to Native Americans that Harvard could expand.
“I do think it would be nice to have a more prominent memorialization than something that people can usually just walk by without grappling with or dealing with," she said.
Dillon agreed with Sadlier and said Harvard could do more to support Native American students by “making the funds, the resources, the space, and the staff available to cater to Native students.” He said he felt the support he received from Harvard as a Native American student quickly disappeared after he was admitted to the College.
“I feel like Harvard's commitment to Natives stops with recruitment,” he said. “It's all about having the numbers here, and then once we walk in the door, it's kind of like sink or swim."
Alex Miller, Associate Dean of Student Engagement and Interim Associate Dean for Diversity and Inclusion, wrote in an emailed statement that the College strives to create an “inclusive community.”
“Harvard College is committed to creating an environment where students can come together to intersect with one another and support and learn from each other,” Miller wrote. “Harvard College’s goal is to provide a welcoming and supportive home to all our students – and we do this work through our Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) offices.”
“Students play a critical role in helping us achieve the type of inclusive community that we strive to be, and we encourage any students who may be interested in helping us achieve this goal to contact us,” Miller added.
NAHC President Noah Cominsky ’20 said he appreciated that the CEB partnered with NAHC to host last week's panel during Native American Heritage Month.
“I think it's just establishing a precedent, particularly in the month of November,” he said. “It's nice to have that institutional support that the panelists were calling for.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Travelling across the country for Thanksgiving break, Harvard men’s basketball split a pair of Bay Area road games. Following a close loss to San Francisco, the Crimson was able to top Saint Mary’s to cap off the California campaign.
HARVARD 74, SAINT MARY’S 68
Hoping to avoid going home without a victory, Harvard (3-3) needed to do what only one other team had done in the past three seasons: win a non-conference game on the Gaels’ home court. Such a feat could not be completed without a full and outright team effort, and the Crimson delivered just that. Even with senior captain Corey Johnson recording zero points and junior forward Chris Lewis not seeing action in the contest, five Harvard players finished the game in double-digits in scoring.
“The overall effort for all our guys [and] the front-line depth with Henry [Welsh] and Robert Baker, I thought we just had sensational minutes out of everyone and in a place like [McKeon] Pavilion], you need that,” coach Tommy Amaker said.
Harvard’s impressive scoring effort was led by junior forward Henry Welsh. Playing in his home state, the Redondo Beach native racked up a career-high 15 points and added five rebounds. Welsh was instrumental to maintaining the Crimson’s lead into the second half, hitting consecutive baskets to start the period.
Harvard shot 53 percent from the field as a team, the fourth time in six games this seasons that the Crimson has hit over half of its field goals. Adding to Welsh’s 15-point effort, freshman guard Noah Kirkwood tallied 12 points for the second straight game. Junior guard Christian Juzang, junior forward Robert Baker, and sophomore forward Danilo Djuricic each accounted for 10 points.
Harvard’s defense held tough in the first half, allowing only 24 points to Saint Mary’s (3-3). A 34-point effort going into halftime gave the Crimson a 10-point lead entering the break.
The Gaels eventually found offensive firepower, putting up 44 points in the second half. Harvard upped its own offense as well, tallying 40 points of its own in the latter period.
Saint Mary’s best chance came in the middle of the second half through an 11-1 run that cut the Crimson lead to only two. Before the momentum was completely swung in the direction of the Gaels, Harvard responded with a 6-0 run of its own. The Crimson was able to extend its lead to double-digits with just under a minute to play, allowing the clock to bleed out for the victory.
“Coming here to play against a really good basketball team and a very tough place that I’m not sure many people have been able to scrap out wins here, it just says a lot about the growth of our team,” Amaker said.
SAN FRANCISCO 61, HARVARD 57
In Harvard’s first contest of Thanksgiving break, the Dons (6-0) kept their undefeated season alive with a nail-biting victory over the Crimson. San Francisco took an early lead, leaving Harvard to climb out of an early hole in an attempted comeback.
The first half was almost all Dons, with San Francisco taking a 32-21 lead into the break, a lead that was cut down by a Kirkwood triple just before the break.
Despite the Dons’ taking a 14-point lead early in the second half, the Crimson refused to back down. Slowly scraping away at the deficit early in the latter period, two free-throws from freshman Spencer Freedman finally gave Harvard the lead with 5:06 to play, the cap of a 16-5 run. San Francisco fought back, and with just over half a minute left held onto a fragile lead. Freedman’s runner to tie the game at 59 missed with 34 seconds left, and the Dons knocked down their free-throws at the end of the contest to ice the game.
“I was really pleased and proud that we fought our way and scratched our way back in it...I thought they got to the foul line a lot more than we did, which I thought was a big difference in the game,” Amaker said. “I thought their ability to get on the offensive backboard really hurt us as well.

Are you a lecture texter? A techy Becky? A...letter writer?! Find out which of these phone-y personalities suits you:
iPhone:
We’ve all met you, and, most likely, are you. We can’t pin you down, mostly because you’re pretty boring. You’re image-conscious and hygienic (love to discuss skin care), but you’re also a follower, and you’ve been okay with that ever since you lost the sixth grade class presidency to a guy who now owns an Android. You’ve been known to wake up sweating after nightmares where your texts show up green on another person’s iPhone and you love to tell your one fun fact about Steve Jobs that you garnered from that horrible Ashton Kutcher movie.
Android:
Ahhh, the Android user — the dirtier cousin of the iPhone user who’s been seen in the same Zuckerberg-esque hoodie for three consecutive Thanksgivings. You love ~tech~ and live for the look of shock on people’s faces when you reach into your back pocket and pull out your phone. “They were expecting an iPhone…Aha! Not from a man like me.” Cue evil laugh. You did your research before buying a phone which we agree is commendable — but that does not give you a right to lecture everyone about your “superior bandwidth.” (A euphemism? We hope not.)
Samsung Galaxy:
We’re not sure why this singular phone model has such a vibe unto itself, but it certainly does. Galaxy users are very “off the beaten path,” which is a nice way of saying that they’re not very bright. Somehow, the ads for this phone got lodged in their heads and convinced them that they wanted this phone. No one truly wants this phone.
Blackberry:
You love to work and hate to give off the impression that you have enough free time to be in touch with what’s on trend. You’re very sensitive to light, sound, and general fun. You wore suits in middle school and nowadays you eat "lean" proteins and work out compulsively. People have told you that Blackberries aren’t very "in" anymore, but you were too caught up in another email to hear them.
Anything with a Broken Screen:
You wrote poetry in high school and have sung at more than one open mic. The disheveled nature of your phone reflects the disheveled quality of your soul — and you like it like that.
Writes letters:
You hate capitalism and see the purchase of a smartphone as a capitulation to a ceaseless cycle of increasing inequality. You love it when people ask for your number and you ask for their “address” back. You spend your nights staring out the window. You’re the worst, but we appreciate your dedication.
