After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
According to many so-called “experts,” the college dating scene is dead. They say students are driven only by the hook-up culture, valuing casual relationships over any semblance of commitment. But I’m here to tell those experts that they are dead wrong. I, for one, go on many dates, often with other people, and I’d like to help you become as successful as I am in the world of finding true love.
The first thing you need in your love arsenal is simple, and I guarantee if you’re reading this column you already have it: Harvard. Harvard is a chick/dude/chude (the alternate combination of dude and chick, while perhaps more accurate, was nixed by my editor) magnet. Who needs to flirt when you’ve got the Harvard brand? Now that I am twenty one, I walk into bars and just say, “Hey, I’m Brett. I go to Harvard. It’s just a little place we like to call Harvard. It’s right down the road from the school up the road from Harvard.” I then toss in the word “hermeneutics,” because, while I don’t know what it means, it’s sexy to use big words. I have yet to get a guy’s number this way, but in those few seconds between when he stares blankly and then walks away, leaving me the tab, I can feel the pure hermeneutics between us.
Once you have a target in your sights, it’s time to reel him in. Some girls try wearing revealing clothing, smiling and laughing, or lightly touching a guy’s arm. You might think this would work, but I, the expert of love, am here to tell you that this is a bunch of codswallop. Being liberal arts students, we are trained to think in terms of figurative language. We think that dating, to use a simile, is like fishing; you cast a wide net, look for the perfect catch, and entice him with worms or bits of old sandwiches. The truth, however, is that we must come down from our metaphor-laden ivory towers and realize that dating is fishing. I get lots of guys because while some people use their allure, I use an actual lure, literally hooking guys while others are just hooking up. Forget diamonds and Neil Patrick Harris: A spinning rod and fishing tackle are a girl’s best friend.
Now that you’ve got your guy, it’s time to go on a date. There are several things to understand about dating. First, make sure that he has stopped bleeding from the site of the fishhook wound. If he hasn’t, that’s a deal breaker. You want to make sure that your future children have excellent clotting abilities, and hemophilia went out of style with the czars. Next, it’s time to keep an ear out for alarm bells. In my continuing efforts to bring literalism back, I like to carry an actual bell with me so both he and I (and the rest of the restaurant/movie theater/ Department of Health and Human Services) know when I start to sense that the date is going downhill.
At this point, you inexperienced daters might ask, what sorts of things should I keep an eye out for on a first date? The best advice I have is to listen to your instincts. If something feels off about this guy Muammar because he refuses to go out in public and is constantly muttering about NATO-backed rebel forces, ring that bell loud and proud—you don’t want someone who’s too shy for some old fashioned public displays of affection. If the first thing he says to you is “you have a lovely pair of knockers,” it’s time to chime. He is clearly a considerate young man, but his inability to use a more intellectual term (like “breasts” or “hermeneutics”) shows a lack of intelligence that may get in the way of your true happiness.
I know you may be nervous about giving my techniques a try, especially since I have only guided you up through the first date. But don’t worry; the key is simply to get out there. It’s time to take love by the gills and reel it in. Once you do that, and follow all of my advice to the letter, you won’t have any trouble snagging that second date. And second dates are really what this is all about. I hope to have one someday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Let’s face it. Alcohol is an integral part of many students’ social lives on campus. It dominates our weekend conversations, dictates which parties we go to and is one of the main perceived advantages that upperclassmen who are 21 have over everyone else.
Recently, The Crimson has published several opinions that seem to support lowering the drinking age to 18. They have demonized Greek life and final clubs for their exclusivity in order to pressure our administration into condoning illegal drinking. Their arguments include explanations of how lowering the drinking age would diminish the rebellious aura of drinking and that freshman would be magically allowed into overflowing parties just because they would be legal. These arguments are blissfully ignorant of the realities of our campus and if the drinking age was lowered to 18, it would only cause the student body to drink more dangerously.
Take a moment and think about the people you know who drink. We all know several people that absolutely need to pregame before going to a party. They obsess over it and refuse to go out unless they have had several shots. They have such an irrational fear of going to a party sober that they would rather not go out at all than leave their rooms with a .00 blood alcohol content, and when the pregaming is through, they are always at least four shots ahead of you. Many of these people find themselves in University Health Services with some regularity.
How did our friends get this way? Haven’t you noticed that most of them didn’t drink in high school, but at college they suddenly need alcohol to function socially even though they are so inexperienced that they either don’t know their own limits or intentionally drink past them? These students clearly can’t control themselves, so why would these people drink less if alcohol became more available to them? Alcohol has become their social catalyst. Their drinking habits are not an attempt to act cool or rebellious. They are just trying to feel less awkward and they believe that alcohol is the only solution to their problem. Their behavior can’t be solved with learned, responsible drinking since these people only feel comfortable when they are dangerously drunk so lowering the drinking age would do nothing but enable them to drink more.
As I’ve already hinted, one argument for lowering the drinking age is that, with accessibility to alcohol in bars and clubs, underage students would stop dangerously pregaming in their rooms. This argument makes the large assumption that students have a large amount of money to spend on alcohol. If you and a group of friends wanted to drink and were on a college budget, would you go to a bar that has $7+ drinks or go buy $15 handle of cheap vodka and a two-liter Diet Coke, which is more than capable of getting a small group of people extremely drunk?
Of course the counter-argument to this is that people can just drink at the parties instead of pregaming, but where are these parties? Every weekend droves of people travel from overflowing party to overflowing party trying to find something good and either give up or clog a party so much that it gets shut down. Shouldn’t some of these roving students be throwing their own events? This brings us to another cultural problem here, the average student’s sense of “privilege”. Many have complained about the exclusivity of final clubs and frat parties but frankly, these organizations have every right to be exclusive. If an organization pays for the booze and the space and puts the effort into throwing a party, it has every right to decide who it lets in and who it doesn’t.
Most students don’t want to take the time to throw their own parties, so they demand that student groups and the Harvard administration provide the parties for them. How much should we expect the administration to bend over backward for our social wants? Even with available space, many students are just unwilling to put the time and money into hosting a fun event. So how would lowering the drinking age fix this? Answer: It won’t. Lowering the drinking age won’t encourage anyone to throw safer drinking parties. Thus, the end result of lowering the drinking age would not be more and safer parties that would stop students from pregaming, but more reckless pregaming, more broken UHS records and the very real and increased chance that one of your friends could die.
We want to lower the drinking age in the name of fun but is it really worth it when that freshman who passes out in your House’s garbage room or on the steps of Lamont doesn’t wake up again? Is that a price we are willing to pay just so that we can’t remember what we did last night?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At this time of the year finals clubs are choosing their new members, and so the clubs are a common topic of conversation on campus. With many students punching, or wishing they were punching, the eight all-male organizations on campus, there is no denying the popularity of these groups.
However, final clubs are gender-divided and must enact wide-scale changes in order to remain a positive part of Harvard life. Most importantly, final clubs and their director boards adamantly stand against allowing female membership—except at parties. Although not equally true of every male final club, many host late-night parties on Friday and Saturday nights, outside of which underclassmen women line up in revealing clothing to be allowed to enter. Their male friends are left behind, by choice or by a door closed in the face. This raises the question: Why are women largely allowed into these spaces late at night? This system makes it seem as if women are useful insofar as they are sexual objects and begets a negative party environment.
We implore students: Do not punch male final clubs until each one makes a commitment to break down barriers and support gender inclusivity. We ask that women refuse to accept this norm and instead party in an environment wherein they would be routinely accepted as equals.
Although the exclusion of women is the biggest problem with the clubs, the punch process is also concerning in that it is an elitist approach to networking. Although once students are invited to punch they all go through the same selection process, the fact is that you probably will not be punched unless one of the club’s few members knows you from high school, a sports team, or an extracurricular. The lack of an open selection process separates the final clubs from other groups on campus, and prevents them from being meritocratic, by any standard. We understand the logistical difficulties that would be involved in inviting anyone to punch. However, clubs should consider that they are an important part of Harvard’s history and tradition, and to effectively lock students out of membership because of their pre-College conditions is antithetical to what the Harvard experience represents.
Sadly, the rising popularity of final clubs has been at least partly propagated by Harvard's ineptly designed alcohol policies. Specifically, Harvard's strictly enforced prohibition of alcohol in freshman dorms ultimately pushes younger students to find private areas to drink. To those who do not know upperclassmen on campus it makes sense to go to the parties where it is widely acceptable, for women, to show up as a total stranger—male final clubs. Final clubs provide an opportunity for freshmen girls to drink copious amounts without supervision or accountability, a dangerous scene that is compounded by the lack of official connection to Harvard. Moreover, male freshmen see their female friends clamoring to get into the clubs, increasing their desire to get punched the next year, and the cycle of social power and unsafe open parties continues.
There is another side to this story, though. As a student body, we should aspire to more than the corrosive status quo wherein final clubs are allowed to dominate social life through nice houses and money. Why are students pleading to get into a private party where they know no one inside? Why must the Owl or the Phoenix be the go-to destination of the night rather than your linkmate’s birthday party? The bottom line is that final clubs are merely groups of guys with a building on campus. We, also, should ask more from our Saturday nights.

I was disappointed to read a recent Crimson editorial staff article, “The COOP- a Cooperative?”, mostly because of the mistakes in reporting and complete lack of knowledge about cooperatives in general and the COOP in particular. I would like to address these comments in the article and set the record straight.
First and foremost, the article is confusing a business model and a corporate structure. The COOP is and has always been a Massachusetts’s cooperative corporation. As with any cooperative, the COOP is owned by its members. A change in the business model does not change our governance structure only how the business operates. The statement “no longer grants those who pay the $1 membership fee ownership in the company” is not true.
Secondly, the COOP’s  mission statement focuses on being competitive, that doesn’t mean necessarily being the lowest price available. We offer students many options in course materials at different price points (new, used, digital, rental) and a bundle of value (price, assortment, availability, right edition, convenience). Our mission also states that the COOP should make a profit in order pay its members a rebate for their patronage and support any capital needs of the business. The article states that the COOP “must find a way to reclaim its mission by providing books at competitive prices”, but the COOP doesn’t need to reclaim its mission, it never lost it.
Furthermore, the COOP does reflect the definition of a cooperative as members are the owners and a large percentage of members patronize the stores.  A cooperative is in fact one of the oldest loyalty programs in existence. A  Cooperative is only successful if its members come together and support the store by shopping there.  The COOP doesn’t “promise an 8-10 percent rebate for all purchases made there”. As with any cooperative, The COOP only promises to share in the profits generated by member business and that amount is based on the profits at the end of the year which may vary depending on how well the store has done and how strong its member’s support has been.
And finally, Harvard College does not “allow the COOP to sell required course books all in one place”. The COOP chooses to support the educational mission of the College by selling required course materials as part of its mission to student members. For the almost 130 years of its existence, the COOP has in fact allowed Harvard to not have to use resources to support a store and take their focus off what they do best- educate students.
There is no competitive advantage afforded the COOP. In fact, the COOP supports the University further by functioning as the aggregator of the book list and by posting it on its website in a timely manner so that students will know what is adopted for classes and have the info to shop wherever they want, not just at the COOP.
The COOP will continue to focus on its mission as a cooperative and, as it has done for all of its existence, will adjust the business model as needed to be relevant to the needs of its current membership.

In his article, “A Nail in the Coffin of Liberal Zionism,” Mr. Shams depicts Israel in a distorted light failing to mention or condemn the incessant Palestinian rocket and mortar attacks, and suicide bombers that kill and maim innocent Israel men, women and children.
Palestinian citizens of Israel have the right to vote with full equality under the law and enjoy far more rights and freedoms than in any Arab country. There are Muslims in the Knesset and Arabic is also one of the official languages of Israel. Palestinian women enjoy more rights in Israel than other Muslim women do in their own homelands. For example women in Saudi Arabia are not allowed to drive or even leave the house without a male escort. The Israeli government provides its Arab citizens with food, medical benefits, jobs and the freedom of worship.
Hamas, the party that makes up a leading proportion of the Palestinian government refuses to recognize Israel’s right to exist and openly denies the Holocaust. Palestinian children are indoctrinated into anti-Jewish hatred in their schools. From Camp David in 2000, the Clinton parameters in 2001, to the 2008 offer of Palestinian statehood with a division of Jerusalem by Israel’s Prime Minster Olmert, Palestinian leaders have continuously rejected statehood because it would mean acknowledging the existence of Israel. These facts Mr. Shams turns a blind eye to, making his article both a sham and a shame.

For all I whined about wanting to go to Disneyland, my parents would have thrown their own fit to find out that I didn’t really actually care about Space Mountain or Mickey Mouse’s house. They probably thought my polite refusal when they tried to buy me Itzakadoozie popsicles was simply evidence of well-instilled frugality. Sure, my Asian mama taught me right and I didn’t want to waste, but the real deal was that, once there in the “happiest place on earth,” what I really looked forward to was the trip back.
When you’re going someplace, someplace is never the place to be. You discover that Sleeping Beauty’s castle has shrunk since last time. You realize that you spend 80 percent of your vacation standing in line under the one broken mist machine. You find yourself thinking about Goofy’s minimum wage and about how Disneyland is an ingenious, super-lucrative enterprise for the Walt Disney Corporation. You’re cynical, but you’re right to be so.
The dirty secret is that my favorite part of our trips is the trip itself, the long expedition we have to take in our silver Honda Pilot (my dad’s manly upgrade from our powder-blue minivan) to get anywhere officially distant and exciting enough to be a vacation destination. I love the forced family time, the temporary acceptability of junk food, the rediscovery of Cantonese pop CDs, the vague stench of library books in heat. I love the impossibility of doing anything productive, the lack of internet connection and cell service, the miles and miles of nothing-time where you’re nowhere but in between.
For the same reasons, every word I bitch about my flights between San Francisco and Boston is hyperbolic. It’s usually too hard to explain quickly how great a transcontinental flight can be, how it’s an experience worth having despite the eau de flatulence that slams you upon boarding, the still nerve-wracking take-offs, and the conflicting desires to pee and not to pee. Even this year’s three-legged red-eye hurricane-evading journey back to school was just as fun to embark upon as to complain about. The nothing time of traveling alone is rife with possibility: oh yes, I had McDonald’s for dinner—and I told my dad about it.
The best part is the strangers. (New Yorkers, I know you won’t relate to this, but really, what is the deal with that?) The passengers on these long-haul flights all seem to be in on this collective limbo; seat-mates are veritable Easter eggs of opportunity. It’s a sociological experiment—and remember, if they ever look too predatory, you can either pretend to read Hemispheres magazine or ring the flight attendant.
There’s something lovely about befriending people you’ll never see again. I’m left with apocryphal trivia—an old Bain guy told me that the Annenbergs made their fortune mining silver in Nevada—and life stories. Who cares if they’re true or false? I had a good time hearing about Dyan the middle-aged-Jewish-lesbian’s participation in pro-choice protests in college. I liked listening to Messias, the Brazilian businessman, describe the antics of his wily toddler David and his love-struck teenager Ana Carolina. Miles above an irrelevant fly-over state, there’s a connection being made, and this new person will be only what they’ve been to you. The stakes are zero and there’s no future to ruin what you had.
As you’re suspended in the air, the year ahead of you is fat with possibility. New classes, new dorm rooms, new friends, new challenges—the picture in your head is shiny with giant Sleeping Beauty castles, fireworks with no risk of burning children, and a Mickey furry who’s really just a wealthy doctor trying to make kids smile on the weekend. When you’re in between, the past consists of nostalgic memories, selectively curated, and the future holds your as-of-yet unchallenged expectations. When you’re in between, you’re always in motion, progressing steadily toward Xanadu.
Here’s to hoping my guaranteed unemployment come summer will be this kind of glorious in-between. As a VES concentrator, I recognize my doom. But isn’t it great that Harvard’s equipped me with the tools to theorize my potential homelessness—or bohemian peripatetic joie de vivre?—into my own “happiest place on earth”? Fellow unemployable seniors (to everyone else: reconsider I-banking), see you in the in-between. At least in my head, it doesn’t seem so bad at all.
—Melissa C. Wong ’12, a VES concentrator in Cabot House, is looking forward to her time in purgatory.

New Zealand: an island known for Mordor’s famous jewelry collections, hairy high-pitched comedic folk singers, and sheep. It’s a sub-nation of Australia and home to the three Rs: Racing, Beer, and Rugby. This fall, 20 teams from around the world have gathered in New Zealand for a sporting event bigger than the FIFA World Cup, the World Series, and World War II combined. FM Presents: A Particularly Informed Guide to the World Cup of Rugby!
THE HISTORY:
Founded by the Soviets in 1890, rugby, or as it was known back then, Communist Football, began as a theatrical dance where performers would stand on large poles tossing sheep stomachs to one another. With the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1991, Communist Football moseyed its way over to England, where the English got rid of the poles, changed the sheep stomachs to egg-shaped balls, and took on the rules of American Football. Hence modern rugby was born.
THE GAME:
Rugby is played with 15 brutish, temperamental gladiators on each side. It’s a cross between contact hot potato and acrobatic soccer. The field they play on, which is specially designed for the game, has two sides of equal length adjacent to two other sides of equal length.
The object of the game is to maim the opposing team so that your team can get the most touchdowns. This makes sense, because injured people are slow and useless. One of the most unique aspects of play is that competitors can only throw the ball backwards. This, of course, is because of the Coriolis effect in the southern hemisphere (also the reason toilets drain the other way).
THE VIEWING EXPERIENCE:
As the premier international tournament of the sport, the World Cup of Rugby is not to be missed. Three billion people—half of the world’s population—are watching it. Representing America among these viewers are Tommy Wilkinson from Detroit, Willy Tomkinson from Raleigh, and David Beckham from Los Angeles. There would probably be more than three people following in the U.S. if the games weren’t on at such obscure times. Why do those damn internationals play sports at three in the morning anyway?!
With all of this in mind, you are now ready for the thrill of your life. The World Rugby Cup quarterfinals are coming up Oct. 8. Get your Foster’s chilled, start practicing your Maori Haka chants, and GO TEAM USA! If only we hadn’t lost in the first round.

The bike ride from Winthrop House to Cambridge City Councilor Leland Cheung’s house-turned-campaign headquarters takes me past the Common and the Quad, past the fire station at Sherman Street and its sign reminding Cantabridgians to vote, November 8th. It’s a 15-minute ride, tops, but by the time I reach Cheung's house, I have trouble recognizing that the neighborhood is only a mile from Harvard Square
I don’t see anywhere to lock my bike, so I throw the lock through the spokes of the front tire and park it in the driveway. Right at 9:30 a.m., I knock on the basement door, as instructed. I am greeted by G. Anthony Morse, Cheung’s campaign manager.
Morse offers me a seat and asks if I have any questions. He tells me “Leland” will be right down. The councillor is always referred to by his first name. Councillor Cheung is the name of a stale elected official; Leland is just a 33-year-old newlywed, hoping for your vote.
When Cheung walks down the stairs, he greets me, quickly shakes my hand, and sits behind his desk. He turns to his computer, where he notices that there is a ribbon-cutting at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School (CRLS). It starts in 20 minutes.
Cheung asks, “Should I wear like, khakis and a dress shirt or should I wear—” “Yeah,” Morse interrupts. “I’d say it’s Saturday, it’s a little more casual.” Cheung exits the room and returns, a few minutes later, in a navy suit. He occasionally poses these types of questions and listens to the answers, but in the end he relies primarily on his own judgment.
And he’s out the door. We plan to meet later on the campaign trail—I’ll go canvassing with Cheung’s staff, then he will catch up with us.
We wait for the other members of the staff. Cheung’s aide, Megan E. Montgomery, arrives first, Dunkin’ Donuts iced coffee in hand, with Press Secretary Christopher R. Kellogg close behind. We pile into Morse’s SUV and drive back down Garden Street towards Cambridgeport, where they’ll be canvassing. Cambridgeport is downstream of Harvard, closer to MIT than to the Square. The staff members are all fairly recent college graduates, and talk quickly turns to cars, families, significant others.
The fact that Leland Cheung is a smart man can hardly be called into doubt. Later in the day, upon seeing his framed diplomas, one atop the other on the wall, I ask, “So, is that a double major?” “It’s two different degrees,” he informs me. A Bachelor of Arts in economics and a Bachelor of Science in physics. Both awarded by Stanford University. Not too shabby, but possibly overshadowed by his current educational endeavor—a dual degree MBA/MPA at the MIT Sloan School of Management and the Harvard Kennedy School.
And Cheung puts that intelligence to work. When the Cheung campaign claims that no one canvasses the way they do, it’s easy to believe. The strategy is, I was informed, a trade secret, and my one caveat for the day was to keep it that way. All I will say on the subject is that it is highly effective.
Eventually, Cheung arrives in Cambridgeport. He parks his car, gets out, and talks quickly with his staff. Tablet in hand, he sets off to knock on doors. I follow him.
Cheung, unlike many politicians, is in this business to get things right. He’s the kind of man who’s interested in optimization, who worked to make his canvassing system as efficient as possible. He explains his decision to pursue two undergraduate degrees at once, saying, “It’s kinda like, you’re paying for it, you might as well maximize what you’re getting out of it.”
For Cheung, facing his first re-election since taking office two years ago, politics is about fixing problems, not about putting on an act for a camera. When a photographer asks him to position himself closer to his constituents to better frame a photo, he balks at the idea. When he utilizes lines, as all politicians do, he delivers them with a tinge of discomfort. “Historically,” he repeats over and over, “the newest member of the council is the one that’s not reelected, so I definitely need all the number one votes I can get.”
There are nine at-large Cambridge City Councillors who each represent the entire city. When voters go out to the polls, they rank each candidate, starting at number one and going down as far as they wish. As a candidate, the higher you’re ranked the better, and the number one vote is the crown jewel of each ballot.
Once we finish up in Cambridgeport, I climb into the passenger seat of Cheung’s two-door car and we drive to his fourth appearance of the day, the CitySprouts Festival at a Cambridge elementary school. City Council and School Committee candidates are out in full-force. Cheung works the crowd—seeks out people he knows, talks to a few he doesn’t. He jokes with Jamie Towns, who has been married for 15 years, about his recent honeymoon to Shanghai. “It was more like a shopping excursion for her. I wanted to go to a beach and relax, she wanted to go shopping,” Cheung confides. “She won.”
This is our last event, so we take our leave and walk back to the car. I see a parking ticket in the back seat. I ask if he’s allowed to just waive them. He laughs. “I got one this morning. I ran into the CRLS thing, I’m like, alright, it’s supposed to be done in an hour. And the meters are only for an hour, so I just put an hour in the meter and then of course it starts late and goes long, and I’m up on stage, so it’s not like I can just get up and leave. Just like, ‘Excuse me, I’m going to go feed my meter.’ So then you get a ticket. And because you’re a City Councillor, you can’t even complain about them.”
We arrive back at 157 Garden Street, where the day began, and he sits down at his desk. I look around and after a few minutes, I leave him to his homework.

I. Two Images
The groundbreaking for Gund Hall in 1969 was supposed to be symbolic, or conciliatory, or something like that.
Fifth graders from Houghton Elementary School—located in another, non-Harvard part of Cambridge—were shipped in for the event to dig the first shovels into the dirt, before construction workers did the real work. This was, of course, meant to showcase the surrounding communities’ evolving relationship with the University, and it made for a damn good photo-op. Harvard at the time still didn’t hire very many black people for big projects like this, so mostly everyone in attendance was white.
Behind the scenes, tensions raged amongst students and faculty, and the planning stages for the building had already been halted multiple times, partly due to the strenuous political environment on campus.
The year 1969 also saw a different sort of groundbreaking: growing civil unrest among college students across the country finally broke out on campus, with the Harvard chapter of the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) leading the charge.
The common image of Harvard in 1969 is one of University Hall occupied by student protesters speaking out against the Vietnam War, of protesters escorting administrators out of the building.  The scene is one of frenzy, exciting but somewhat troubling.
Taken together, these two separate events—the groundbreaking of Gund Hall and the University Hall protest earlier that same year—say something about Harvard’s urge for development, even in times of political discord and community upheavals. In times good and bad, Harvard keeps growing.
In all honesty, some people weren’t sure Gund Hall would ever actually be built. The situation was complicated. But the fifth graders were cute, so people smiled. That’s what you do at these sorts of things.
II. Noise
The University Hall protests more or less amounted to noise. ROTC was ejected from campus, the UC was established, and the Harvard Corporation pretended to listen to students for a while. Noise is good.
Gund Hall’s groundbreaking saw a quieter protest. A petition distributed during the event, signed by 90 students, faculty, and staff, insisted on Harvard’s responsibility to the surrounding community. It said that architects and urban planners should be more interested in solving urban problems, both in Cambridge and abroad. It charged that Harvard didn’t admit enough poor students. It pointed out Harvard’s racist employment policies. Noise.
The construction site, an ugly, inconvenient dirt pit across the street from Memorial Hall, rested on property formerly owned by a local church that Harvard bought out (which Harvard does from time to time). The fifth graders dug into earth that no longer belonged to Cambridge, and people  smiled.
III. Building Apart
In theory, the construction of Gund Hall was supposed to unite the Graduate School of Design under a single roof, bringing students together in an intense creative exchange. Maybe it did that, but for some it did nothing to diminish Harvard’s perceived arrogance towards the surrounding communities.
A statement in the petition sums up the building’s place in history nicely. It reads, “The new building ... helps to foster the illusion that our basic problems are caused by inadequate physical facilities, and not by more fundamental issues.”
When the building was completed in October of 1972, one of the architects lamented, “It was a long and painful experience. The attitude at Harvard is that anyone should be thankful for the privilege of working with this University. Well, I’d have to say the building is a success in spite of the GSD.”
Gund Hall might not look much like the rest of Harvard—no red brick—but there is a distinct haughtiness to it. With the staggered roof, ultra-reflective windows, and large overhang on the Quincy Street side, walking past is an all-consuming experience. To top it off, the building is insulated by Memorial Hall, William James, and the Sackler. Gund Hall is not a part of Cambridge.
Things have certainly changed since 1969: Harvard provides substantial financial aid to people who need it, hires minorities, and sometimes listens to students. But there’s still a distinct insular quality to Harvard that’s likely not going away anytime soon. It’s built right into our campus.

YZAZVYZ—the average Harvard student would dismiss these seven letters as gibberish, but Sam P. Rosin ’15 can rearrange them to form a word in a mere three seconds. To him, it’s obvious that these letters spell “zyzzyva,” a type of weevil and the name of a computer program he uses daily to train for the World Scrabble Championship.
Rosin will compete in the tournament in Warsaw, Poland from Oct. 12 to 16. As part of the 15 member U.S. team, Rosin will play 34 games over the course of the biennial championship. “It’s intense,” Rosin said, but he’s excited to meet the other contenders. “At Worlds two years ago, I had opponents from Uganda, Nigeria, Bahrain, Thailand, Singapore ... all over the world. [For many of the contenders,] English isn’t even their first language.”
Rosin’s Scrabble career began at the age of eight. He came across a book that his grandfather had given his father: “Word Freak: Heartbreak, Triumph, Genius, and Obsession in the World of Competitive Scrabble Players.” The book’s author, Stefan Fatsis, narrates his transition from sports writer and casual Scrabble fan to tournament-level contender. Rosin was fascinated by the story and joined his first Scrabble club. At age nine, he started beating his father and participated in his first local Scrabble tournament.
At age 16, Rosin was the youngest U.S. representative to ever make it to the World Championships and placed 39th at the 2009 Malaysia competition. In addition, Rosin has competed in the U.S. National Scrabble Championship seven times. In 2010, he came in 12th place.
Rosin’s most epic move ever? The word “LIQUORED.” Falling on two triple word score spaces, the move gained him 221 points. In the same game, he also achieved his highest final score of 723 points. “I don’t complain about my letters,” Rosin said. “It’s not about your tiles, it’s about the play you make.”
There are tricks of the trade to help him make these high-scoring plays—musical notes (such as do, re, mi), Greek letters, and Hebrew letters are all fair game. Moreover, if your opponent doesn’t challenge a word, the word stands. Rosin has successfully bluffed his opponents with made-up words such as “rootset” and “bosic.”
Rosin knows nearly all the words in “The Official Scrabble Players Dictionary,” and his career came full-circle when Fatsis chronicled his journey in the recently-published 10th edition of “Word Freak.”
Rosin is always looking to spread the joy of Scrabble. “Every game is very different; there’s always a new challenge,” he said. “I’ve played thousands and thousands of games, and I still make mistakes.” In high school, Rosin coached two young players, and he is now looking to start a club at Harvard. His one requirement to join? You must be DTS—Down To Scrabble.
CHALLENGING THE CHAMPION
Rosin can’t count the number of Scrabble boards he has at home, but FM challenged him to play on the one he brought with him to Harvard. A typical match should last approximately 45-50 minutes, as players have no more than 25 minutes to consider their moves throughout the game. As a result, Sam is consistently putting words on the board before we’ve even picked more tiles from the bag. In the course of the game, Rosin uses four triple-word spaces and uses all seven tiles in one move twice (called a “bingo,” this move awards the player an extra 50 points).
His highest single move gives him 67 points. The game is also a vocabulary lesson—we learn words such as “twinier,” “oho,” and “qat.” Unsurprisingly, FM was creamed 447 to 241, despite the fact that he passed up two turns to exchange tiles.

As she looked gloomily upon an endless pile of rugs in a Leverett storage room, Sarah P. Siskind ’14 was shocked to notice that one of them was staring back at her.  In fact, it was a large, dead reptile.
“At first, I was exceedingly confused,” Siskind said.  “It was right on top of my rug. There it became less interesting and more problematic.”
When a kind passerby finally offered to help Siskind move the animal, the two women undertook a twenty-minute endeavor during which Siskind and her assistant came up with a few theories to explain the rug.
“My guess was that [its killer] was from a swamp in Louisiana,” Siskind said.  Her helper hypothesized that the rug had been picked up at a garage sale.
The news of the discovery soon went out over Leverett’s open e-mail list.  Rumors began to circulate that a Harvard student had killed an alligator over the summer and had it stuffed and displayed on his wall.
In fact, the reptile in question is a crocodile—skinned, not stuffed—and Oklahoma native Sean P. Murphy ’12 actually shot the croc the summer after his sophomore year in high school during a family trip to Zimbabwe.
First, the thirteen-foot, 1200-pound Crocodylus niloticus found a home in Cabot with Sean’s brother, Conor I. Murphy ’10, where it resided for two years.  But when Sean was a sophomore, he decided to reclaim the crocodile.
“We went to the quad and brought it back on the shuttle,” Murphy said.
“We stood underneath the croc, balanced it on our heads, got off at the church, and brought it back to Leverett,”  his roommate, Bryan Panzano ’12, recalled. “When you’re walking underneath it, it looks like the croc is walking through the street.  We get weird looks more than anything,” he said.
According to Murphy, the crocodile has remained pretty much intact during its six-year tenure at Harvard, though some of the spikes have dropped off.  “He has been stepped on,” said Murphy.
But how does Murphy feel about the long-term prospects of his crocodile?
“It is organic,” he said. “It’s gonna come apart someday.”

Whether you want to help others get rid of stress during midterms or practice the art of seduction on that cutie in your entryway, a relaxing massage is the means to your end. Pull out your scented candles and spread the feeling of leisure with some simple backrub techniques learned from the professionals in StressBusters, a student-group that aims to relieve stress through the art of massage. FM attended one of their workshops and picked up some tips.
1. People like to be touched—it’s human nature. To begin the massage, lay your hands on the shoulders of the person for a few seconds to set the mood.
2. After hunching over a laptop for hours a day, we all feel stress in our backs or necks. Rub your thumbs in circular motion along the person’s back or shoulders. Focus on the sides of the spine, but don’t massage directly on the vertebrae.
3. To create the feeling of cutting away stress, slide the outsides of your hands along the person’s shoulders or up and down the back in a slicing motion.
4. After writing that 10-page paper and asking yourself, “Why did I take this class?” this massage technique will ease your mind, as well as help you get rid of the typing-induced soreness. While holding up the person’s wrist, use your thumb to massage his or her forearm.
5. Hands feeling sore from late night texts or too much Angry Birds? To relieve stress, use your thumb to massage the person’s hands, working your way around the palm.
6. The neck region is the area that tenses up most from stress. Rest one hand on the nape and use your other hand to support the forehead, so the neck can be completely relaxed. Gently massage the neck from the base of the skull down to the upper back using circular motions. Don’t massage too roughly or there could be a choking risk.
7. Finish the massage by gently brushing off the person’s shoulders, back, and arms. You don’t want to abruptly end a massage, so dusting is the perfect subtle finish.
A few warnings: Don’t massage directly on someone’s bones or spine. If you are massaging someone ticklish, don’t get too close to her sides, or you risk a case of hysterics. If someone says, “Don’t touch me there, those are my no no squares,” listen.

Tucked away on one of Boston’s quaintest, most colonial-looking streets stands the outwardly unassuming Jacques Cabaret. Inside, I experienced a night filled with drag queens and debauchery.
A few friends and I arrived at around 9:45 p.m. for the weekend feature, “Miss-Leading Ladies,” which began promptly at 10:15 p.m. After paying the $10 cover, we put our names down at the bar. Getting a reservation necessitates calling weeks in advance, but if there are any no-shows at 10 p.m., they’ll give away tables.
Arriving on the early side allowed us to experience the bar itself before the showcase began. It was very dive-y, with pleather stools and Christmas lights lining a well-stocked bar. I picked up my usual screwdriver for $5 while my comrades bought $3.50 Bud Lights and two mysterious fruity drinks for $5 each. The mixed drinks arrived in 9 oz. plastic Dixie cups, so I immediately wrote them off as weak. Wrong. Let’s just say that the bartenders at Jacques really want you to have a good time. Really.
We were lucky enough to get a table in a sea of brides-to-be, birthday girls, and uncomfortable-looking dudes. Stage lights lined the room, and a starburst of multicolored lightbulbs adorned the ceiling. The runway, jutting out of the barely-elevated stage, was tucked in between the many tables and chairs, giving the audience an up-close-and-personal view. My girls and I were overflowing with anticipation (and two more rounds of drinks) as the spotlights began to pan across the silver curtain and the opening overture blasted on the speakers.
But let’s get to the main attraction: the Miss-Leading Ladies. Out strutted our host, Kris Knievel, and the show began. After calling up the birthday and bachelorette guests of honor in her metallic blue corseted dress and flowing platinum blonde wig, Kris cleared the stage and began a hypnotic lip-synched rendition of X-tina’s “Burlesque,” featuring all of the Miss-Leading Ladies: Destiny, Mizery, Lakia Mondale, and Fena Barbitall. For the duration of the show, the ladies took turns lip-synching both Top 40 dance tunes and lesser-known gems, including “You Can Fuck Me” and “I Wanna See Your Pussy.” Each number showcased the ladies’ sassy moves, but most of the show was devoted to enforced audience participation: faces in boobs, heads up skirts, legs spread and feet used as microphones, and $1 bills wherever we could fit them.
Even if you weren’t the object of these affections, you couldn’t help but dance.
 Jacques Cabaret is located at 79 Broadway, Boston.

1. Fifteen Minutes: What are some of the most important ideas from your recently published book, “Knocking on Heaven’s Door”?
Lisa Randall: There are a number of different themes in it. There’s one about the physics going on today, and what we hope to accomplish in the field. But there’s a second theme that runs throughout the book, which is to really clarify how scientists think about things. I talk about how science really works in practice when you are at the edge of knowledge before things are established, figuring out scientific knowledge and figuring out the role of creativity. There is a bit about the role of science in religion, but again, it’s sort of to clarify what science really does.
2. FM: Because of all the publicity you’ve been receiving from “Knocking on Heaven’s Door,” your days must be busy. What’s a typical day like for Lisa Randall?
LR: I have a couple of papers that I’m trying to work on when I have time. In terms of research, we have a couple of very interesting projects about dark matter and about the implications of the Large Hadron Collider. But I have to admit right now a lot of my time is caught up in the publicity. Part of the reason for that is when you put so much work into writing a book, you really want people to get the ideas in it.
3. FM: Writing a book is a long process. What made you decide to write a second one?
LR: This might sound funny, but in some sense it was sort of frustration with hearing the debates in the real world and realizing that even people who were interested in science didn’t understand how science was working in the sense of where the connections are and what it means to be right and wrong. You’ll see this now—people over-interpret and try to clarify whether it’s the right way to think about these things. And of course it was about the Large Hadron Collider. I thought it would be nice to sort of explain what was going on there.
4. FM: Speaking of the Large Hadron Collider, could you explain more about what this machine does, for all the non-physics people out there?
LR: Hadron refers to a proton and a type of strongly attracted particle. It experiences the strong force, one of the four basic forces of nature. And it’s a collider, so what it does is it accelerates protons to enormously high energy so they can actually collide. Once they do, they can turn into pure energy and then turn into other types of particles, and this relates back to the equation E=MC2. But we are trying to do more than just make particles. We are trying to find out the underlying theory of nature—why do particles have the masses that they do—which could lead to very exotic ideas of understanding the nature of space-time better.
5. FM: What do you think about the recent OPERA announcement of neutrinos breaking of the speed of light?
LR: Basically, the most likely interpretation is that it’s wrong, and there was a mistake made somewhere. It’s like I explain in my book: when we are doing this cutting edge science we are at the edge of technology and theory, and it does go back and forth, and we are trying to sort it all out. Could Einstein’s theory prove to be wrong? Well, maybe the fundamental assumption—such as the underlying symmetry—could be found to have holes in it.
6. FM: Do you think the media sometimes hypes up these discoveries?
LR: I think that the media to some extent reports what they are told. It is true that they are probably emphasizing the most dramatic interpretation of it, but I think that most of them did interview people who said they were skeptical of the result. Part of the reason to present this result is because these guys worked as hard as they could on it and didn’t see anything wrong with it, and they wanted people to weigh in on it ... to see if they can verify it or find something different.
7. FM: You have also published many acclaimed scientific papers. How does the process of writing a book differ from the process of writing a paper?
LR: In my field and for me personally, I think that they are entirely different things. If you are a responsible scientist you are going to present your new results in a paper, and maybe if over time things are established and it’s prime time for the public to hear about it, then you include it in a book. When writing a book, I think it’s somewhat more important to be entertaining—not constantly joking, but I think it’s really important to make it something that people want to keep reading.
8. FM: How did you first develop your passion for physics?
LR: When I was younger I really liked math .... When I came to Harvard I was debating between math and science, and I guess I thought in the end I wanted something that could connect to the real world. I liked puzzle solving and connections. One of the things I really like in my field is that I can move around, and I like entering a field if there is something new to say.
9. FM: As you say, you like to move around in your field. Your work in theoretical particle physics and cosmology deals with both the incredibly tiny and the unimaginably gigantic. How do you reconcile working on such drastically different scales?
LR: Whether unimaginably big or small, we can’t picture these things we are dealing with—but we can imagine them. We can find theories to describe them. It’s sort of what you do when you use Google maps. You zoom in on the scales that are relevant for the problem at hand.
10. FM: You are said to be one of the most cited theoretical physicists of all time. Did you ever think your career would go this far?
LR: I do try to do high-impact work, and I try to think of ideas people haven’t thought about that have broad implications, but I don’t restrict myself to that. I try to work on things that I find interesting. Quite frankly, I think we still haven’t realized that there are women out in the field, which is why I think it’s very nice that my scientific work is important.
11. FM: Speaking of the importance of recognizing women, what advice would you give to girls who feel discouraged about going into physics or math?
LR: I think you do need some degree of confidence. It’s important to really trust your own voice and ability. I don’t know if I was just oblivious when I was younger, but I didn’t really think of it in those terms. I think your generation is more aware of this as an issue, and hopefully they can use that constructively. It’s important to focus on the material and what you are learning, and to enjoy your problem sets.
12. FM:  You graduated from Harvard in 1983. What made you come back to teach here?
LR: It seemed like a fun place to do physics. There are smart people in the department and really great students, and I like being at a broader university that thinks about the humanities. I think there is just something about the underlying culture of the university that I thought I would enjoy.
13. FM: How do you think Harvard has changed since you went here?
LR: That is a very good question. I think it’s really hard to say. Not only has Harvard changed, but I believe I may have changed a little bit too.
14. FM: You used to teach a freshman seminar. Why did you decide to teach one?
LR: I think it’s a lot of fun and really interesting to share different ways to think about science. I’ve had some freshmen who end up going into physics, and I have some who might not take many other classes in physics, but they want a picture of what’s going on. Harvard freshmen are smart, interested, and excited, and it’s fun hearing their different perspectives and stuff that they will share.
15. FM: If you could take one class at Harvard, which class would you take?
LR: I probably wouldn’t take one of those big classes because I find that you could read a book in there, but I probably would take a class in economics or English, or something in the Law School.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dan Shechtman, professor of materials science at Technion-Israel Institute of Technology and Iowa State University, spent years trying to convince the scientific community that his 1982 identification of alloys with crystal-like electron structures was not a huge blunder.
Almost 20 years later, his efforts were vindicated.
Schechtman was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry on Wednesday for his discovery of quasicrystals, materials in which atoms are observed in defined and non-repeating patterns.
These crystal structures exhibit uncommon properties including unusual hardness, brittleness, and slipperiness which allow them to be used in a number of items such as electric shavers.
According to Department of Chemistry Chair Professor Eric D. Jacobsen, the award for the discovery of quasicrystals was not entirely expected.
“Prior to [yesterday], Shechtman was not among the world’s more widely known chemists,” he said.
Shechtman discovered the crystal structures on April 8, 1982, while working at the National Bureau of Standards on a Defense Department-funded project which aimed to identify unusual materials, according to the announcement from the Nobel committee.
He conducted an X-ray diffraction study on an alloy mixture of aluminum and manganese, expecting to observe general randomness in the arrangement of the electrons, Shechtman said in an interview posted by Technicon-Israeli Institute of Technology. The study instead revealed a regular but non-repeating pattern of spots resembling those made by crystals but with a five-fold rotational symmetry.
The discovery, if true, flew in the face of generally accepted notions on the very nature of matter. According to a press release from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, “such a pattern was [then] considered just as impossible as creating a [soccer ball] using only six-cornered polygons, when a sphere needs both five- and six-cornered polygons.”
The discovery was met with great skepticism worldwide, Shechtman said in the online interview. Many scientists, including previous Nobel winner Linus C. Pauling, offered alternative suggestions for the observed diffraction patterns with less challenging implications on material nature. Part of the controversy stemmed from the fact that the discovery had been made by electron microscopy, then not a widely accepted tool in the field of crystallography.
Shechtman describes his fight to dispel the notion that he had simply made a mistake. In the same interview, he admitted even getting expelled from his research group in Israel in light of his claims.
Almost two years after his initial discovery, Shechtman’s findings were published in a physics journal. Soon afterwards, a large number of scientists worldwide began looking into the nature of quasicrystals, according to the Nobel announcement. The structure of quasicrystals has been related to multiple mathematical relationships, including the golden ratio.
Quasicrystals have since been produced by multiple scientists and found naturally in a number of other materials. Much research is now being done to use quasicrystals in products such as non-stick frying pans.
With the honor, Shechtman was awarded 10 million Swedish kronor, an amount roughly equivalent to $1.4 million.
“You know, it taught me that a good scientist is a humble scientist,” said Shechtman in an interview with Nobel media following the announcement of his award, ”somebody who is willing to listen to news in science which are not expected.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ Registrar’s Office is currently working on a proposal to radically overhaul the school’s online student information system, giving hope to the perennial Undergraduate Council campaign promise that students will be able to submit their study cards electronically.
But given the scope of such a project, FAS Registrar Michael P. Burke said, the online course registration is still “years, not months away.”
The easing of the study card process—often a College student’s most direct interaction with the Registrar’s Office—has been a key demand of student leaders dating back to the presidential campaigns of Fall 2009. The issue has remained on the agenda of the UC’s Education Committee for the past school year.
Current Chair Samuel F. Himel ’12 said the committee will prioritize the transition to the web, and UC President Senan Ebrahim ’12 has said that he hoped to have electronic course registration by next fall.
Burke said revamping the registrar’s online services has become one of his major priorities since taking the helm of the Office last January. Administrative deans from various FAS divisions and representatives from Harvard University IT Department are also cooperating on the project.
In addition to moving course registration online, the project aims to digitize student enrollment records as well as enable students to print unofficial transcripts directly.
Administrators including Burke and Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds have indicated that this initiative is still in the early planning phases, and that it is unlikely that any online study card submission will be introduced before the completion of this more long-term project is completed.
“We don’t want to do something that we’re going to have to replace in a few years and we haven’t focused on a short-term fix,” Burke said.
According to Hammonds, an independent HUIT project would need to be proposed in order to see the installation of online class registration on the timeline that student leaders such as Ebrahim are pushing for. But she added that her office has made no requests for independent proposals.
Currently, students add classes to their planner via an online portal and then print out a study card with a barcode scanned by the registrar’s office. Students must get paper signatures from their freshman or concentration advisors, resident deans, and, in some cases, instructors of limited enrollment courses.
This partially electronic system was first used in the fall of 2005. Barry S. Kane, who was registrar at the time, said in 2005 that the move saved the office $50,000.
In the past, faculty members and administrators have objected to online course registration over concerns that students would no longer meet with their advisors if they did not need a paper signature. Hammonds has indicated that the College will only consider plans that will encourage advising meetings.
“You can’t really enforce good mentorship by having a mandatory meeting to sign paperwork,” Ebrahim said in support of a transition to online study cards.
Administrators are also considering coordinating the new FAS system with those of other schools across the University, another wrinkle that could delay its introduction.
Before coming to FAS, Burke spearheaded a similar initiative to create more online access for students during his tenure as the registrar of the Harvard Kennedy School. In addition to the Kennedy School, other divisions across the University, such as the Design School, have introduced online course registration in the past few years.
“Each School’s system is at a different stage,” Burke said. “Now is the time for FAS to consider it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Michael F. Glavin—who coordinated development work with the Allston community and Harvard for the Boston Redevelopment Authority and whose tenure saw the University’s plans for a science complex in the neighborhood halted due to financial constraints—is leaving the BRA later this month to lead the Office of Strategic Planning and Community Development in Somerville.
Glavin will start his new position on Oct. 17.
Having assumed the post of deputy director for institutional development in July 2007, Glavin leaves after overseeing Harvard’s campus expansion into Allston for more than four years.
During this term, the University’s proposals to the BRA have included plans for building the Allston Science Complex and the Charlesview Apartments next to Brighton Mills Shopping Center.
Most recently, the BRA approved Harvard’s plans to construct Tata Hall, a proposed additional wing in the Harvard Business School that will house classrooms and living accommodations for professionals in the executive education program.
Glavin said that he is proud of being able to provide a “new sense of cohesion” between the BRA, the Allston community, and Harvard.
But he said he was disappointed that the economic crisis put a pause on Allston development. In 2009, Harvard announced that its plans to construct a large science complex in Allston were to be indefinitely halted amid a severe financial downturn.
“I regret that we had to deal with that issue, but I’m excited about the opportunities for the University and the community,” Glavin said.
With Glavin’s role in Allston coming to a close, some residents characterized his four years in the position as an ineffective but well-intentioned tenure.
Glavin “was interested in being a kind of neutral party or umpire,” said Brent Whelan ’73, a member of the Harvard Allston Task Force, a community group. “But he was completely unable to perform that role in a way that was useful to the community, mainly due to the complete unwillingness of Harvard to cooperate in a joint planning venture.”
Whelan recalled the last Task Force meeting on Sept. 28 in which Glavin addressed the plans the BRA recently approved allowing Harvard to move forward with its plan to build Tata Hall. In that meeting, Task Force members said they were frustrated with the lack of support they were receiving from the board of the BRA.
But Glavin said he believes Harvard’s work in Allston could ultimately benefit the neighborhood.
“When Harvard continues to work with the help of the BRA to engage with the community, North Allston will become the envy of the entire country,” Glavin said. “You have a great institution and a solid community that understands that Harvard can be a force for positive change.”
Ray Mellone, chair of the Allston Task Force, said that Glavin was a reliable resource for communicating the neighborhood’s concerns to the BRA.
“He was depended on to get our message back to us from the BRA,” Mellone said. “I thought he had a lot of integrity. He always tried to do what was reasonable.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the past decade, the number of eyewear shops in Harvard Square has climbed into the double digits, leaving little room for Harvard Square Optical, which closed in April.
The store operated in the Coop from 1946 to 1996—selling glasses to famous faculty, students, and Cambridge residents. When the small space inside the Coop could no longer hold their growing customer base, the store moved to 65 Mount Auburn St.
But without the prime real estate, the store struggled as the economy took a turn for the worse. Then, last winter sales declined even further.
Neil Cohen, third generation president and optician of the store, shut the doors the following spring.
“We were a staple in Harvard Square,” Cohen said. “I ran a one-man business. I got to know people, and they got to know me.”
Cohen said he provided personal service by going out and looking for frames for customers when he did not have them in stock.
Cohen now works as a traveling optician, bringing a selection of frames and making glasses for customers at their homes, and in an optical shop in Westford, MA.
Harvard Square Optical Shop faced increasing competition in the past decade after many new optical shops opened in the Square, including national chains and other independents.
Eye Q Optical on Eliot Street started in 1999. Store owner and co-founder Paul Fox said he “conceived the shop for the new millennium.”
The company, with two other locations in the Boston area, designs its own lines of frames.
“As a small business, you need to have every edge you can to compete with the nationals. We offer a unique collection of frames,” Fox said.
Lawrence A. Phillips, an optometrist from South Africa, founded Brattle Square Optical in 2007. He had worked at For Eyes at 56 JFK St. for 18 years, until he decided to open his own shop.
“When you come from another country, it’s easier to work for a chain. You don’t need to make any investments. The chain supplies everything,” Phillips said.
Phillips focused his shop on exclusive frames and contact lenses, his specialty.
Despite the rise of optical shops over the last decade, Cohen said he expects that trend to change as consumers continue to turn to contacts and laser eye surgery.
“It’s not a good time for an optical shop,” Cohen said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Sally K. Scopa ’13 returned to Currier House after the summer, the bike she stored in one of the House’s gated courtyards had gone missing. In fact, all the bikes that had once been locked onto the racks were gone.
Quad Bikes—a store that sells new and used bicycles—had taken them.
The Cambridge store, founded by a Harvard graduate, regularly tags unattended and aging bikes on Harvard’s campus. The tag bears a warning to owners, informing them that they have two weeks to remove the tag, otherwise Quad Bikes will take the bicycle.
The manager of Quad Bikes, Michael J. Berlinger, said Currier’s building manager had asked the store to remove the abandoned bikes on the racks. Building manager Manuel J. Casillas declined to comment on this story, referring inquiries to Quad Bikes.
“Manny had been hounding us to come clear out the racks in Currier of abandoned bikes,” said Gabriel Ytterberg, a Quad Bikes employee. “He hadn’t told us some of the bikes weren’t supposed to be taken. He had told students they could store their bikes on these particular racks.”
Several students, who left Cambridge for the summer, lost new and used bikes after the store removed them.
“We tag bikes that we think look abandoned,” Ytterberg said. “We have a checklist we go through. We see if there are rusted chains, non-functional wheels. Just any bike that looks non-useable.”
If the tagged bikes are not removed within two weeks, the locks are cut. Quad Bikes then stores the bikes in their shop for another two weeks.
“After those next two weeks, we take ownership of the bikes,” Berlinger said.
After their initial holding period, the bikes are, depending on their condition, recycled, stripped for parts, or refurbished and sold to members of the Harvard community.
Scopa, who is a Crimson Arts editor, headed to Quad Bikes to inquire about her missing bike after she had seen tags on other bikes.
According to Ytterberg, the store had trouble separating student bikes from abandoned ones.
“It doesn’t take very long for chains to get rusty and most of the bikes probably weren’t in good condition to begin with,” Ytterberg said. “So those looked abandoned.”
Quad Bikes was unable to find her bike.
“They probably refurbished and sold it. They gave me a used bike, free of charge,” Scopa said. “It was perfectly good, and I’m not picky, but my bike was new.”
Although it is procedure for the bike store to film the removal of all bikes for record-keeping, they had not filmed the removal of her bike.
“The description didn’t match any of the bikes we took from that particular rack,” Berlinger said. “We furbished a bike for her and gave her a free lock. I think we did well by her.”
While Scopa was satisfied that the store replaced her bike, she said she was unhappy with the way the situation unfolded.
“They’re taking students’ bikes and selling them back to the same people. I wouldn’t say Quad Bikes is stealing bikes,” Scopa said. “But there is confusion and Quad Bikes is capitalizing on this confusion, which shouldn’t be allowed.”
Quad Bikes, founded by Timothy D. Ledlie ’02, has had their bike removal policy since opening in 2003. Harvard University permits the store to remove abandoned bikes on University property.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Prominent spiritual writer and physician Deepak Chopra and physics researcher Leonard Mlodinow debated the questions that arise from the differences and intersections of their two fields yesterday before a packed audience at the First Parish Church.
Chopra and Mlodinow, a professor at the California Institute of Technology, presented in Cambridge as part of a seven-city tour following the release of their new book, “War of the Worldviews: Science vs. Spirituality.”
In their book, Chopra and Mlodinow wrote alternating chapters that address fundamental questions about the universe, time, life, and God.
But at Wednesday’s event, both authors said they regretted the use of the word “war” in the book title, considering it misguided.
The authors emphasized the complimentary natures of science and spirituality as well as the importance of their co-existence in modern thought.
“Now we would like to call it [the book] either a discussion or a dialectic of our world views,” Mlodinow said at the start of the discussion. “‘Science vs. Spirituality’ is a false dichotomy.”
The two authors agreed that science is key to modern existence, but they said that there are certain questions that only spirituality can address. “Science doesn’t need to evolve and it doesn’t need to answer these questions,” Mlodinow said. “I don’t think future science has to change its methodologies in order to be able to answer those questions.”
But Mlodinow drew a line between the questions that science cannot answer and those that simply have not yet been answered.
Chopra also emphasized the importance of distinguishing scientific findings from spiritual answers. “Most people in their minds confuse evolution as an origin of life, not an origin of species,” he said. “Evolution doesn’t tell us anything about the evolution of life.”
Harvard Divinity School Professor Emeritus Harvey G. Cox Jr. mediated yesterday’s event, which was sponsored by the Harvard Book Store.
Cox asked the authors to define the sharpest difference between their world views. For Mlodinow, science is distinguished from spirituality by the scientific method.
“Science is about looking at the world and defining its truth ... not recognizing its truth,” he explained.
Chopra said that the primary conflict between science and spirituality is the role of consciousness. He held that science
sees the human consciousness as a by-product of other forces, while spirituality views consciousness as a driving force.
“This is a human universe,” he said, defending the spiritual view. “It is a universe that is perceived, observed, and conceived in conscience human beings.”
The authors also agreed that Cox played his part well.
“He is one of the voices trying to bridge the gap between science and spirituality,” Chopra said.
“He was tough on both of us which elevated the dialogue. It made me think I should be less opinionated,” he said after the debate.
“He was an intelligent, focused moderator,” said Mlodinow.
Cox asked the men about teaching children about the coexistence of spirituality and science. Mlodinow agreed with Chopra’s response: “Even though we think we influence their minds through education, we really don’t... If you want to change your children, you’ve got to change your self.  Period.”

University President Drew G. Faust extended a hand to business partners Wednesday to stress the importance of American innovation at Bloomberg Business Roundtable on day two of her Washington, D.C. trip.
The Business Roundtable, an association of chief executive officers, co-hosted the meeting with Harvard to discuss the most pressing issues facing colleges and possible opportunities for collaboration between the private sector and institutions of higher education.
The discussion also included university presidents from MIT, University of Iowa, Stanford, University of Maryland Baltimore County, and University of California Davis.
California Davis.
“There was a lively, interesting discussion today between CEOs and university presidents about collaboration, partnership and our shared agenda in support of innovation,” Vice President for Public Affairs and Communications Christine M. Heenan said. “There is a mutual dependency between business and higher education as the early stage of research and development [businesses] need is done at universities.”
Faust traveled down to Washington this week to advocate for student aid and science research funding in an effort to ensure that neither expenditure ends up on the cutting block as the Congressional debt reduction “supercommittee” looks to shave $1.5 trillion from the national debt.
Heenan said that in this economic climate it has become increasingly important for Harvard to reach out and form coalitions with allies in politics, business, and higher education.
Faust met with several members of the debt supercommittee on Tuesday, including Democratic Congressmen Xavier Becerra of California, James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland. She also met with Democratic Senator Max S. Baucus of Montana, who serves as the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.
“It is a very challenging time in Washington, and it has emerged that it is important to have a shared view, a bi-partisan view, when it comes to innovation,” Heenan said.
House Republican Leader Eric Cantor joined the Business Roundtable for the tail end of the meeting, at which point they discussed the need for a highly skilled workforce to bolster the American economy.
“We need to hear from those individuals who are dedicated to the promotion of innovation in America,” Cantor said in a statement. “That’s how America leads.”
Cantor said that the federal government has a responsibility “to commit the necessary resources and to make priority funding for public institutions who go about basic research so we can bring those ideas to market.”
Prior to the meeting, members of the Business Roundtable had breakfast with John P. Holdren, the science advisor to Obama, as well as representatives of the President’s Council on Jobs and Competitiveness, a non-partisan advisory board that serves to strengthen the economy and create jobs.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Democratic Senate candidate Alan A. Khazei ’83 repeated criticism of the race’s frontrunner, Elizabeth Warren, for accepting money from Political Action Committees Wednesday.
“You can’t play in the rigged political money system and then go and say you’re going to change it,” Khazei said. “She’s playing in a rigged game; I want to change the game.”
The comments came after Khazei spoke at Currier House, where he branded himself as a post-partisan reformer.
He highlighted his experience in grass roots organizing that dates back to his time at Harvard.
Khazei, who also graduated from the Law School in 1987 and served as an IOP fellow in 2006, co-founded national service organization City Year in 1988 while serving as a tutor at Currier House, collaborating with his freshman year roommate and blockmate Michael H. Brown ’83-’84. City Year served as the inspiration for AmeriCorps, a national service program. Khazei currently serves as the CEO of Be The Change, Inc.
This isn’t Khazei’s first senate race. He ran against Martha Coakley for the Democratic nomination in 2009, garnering a wide range of endorsements, including The Boston Globe and Michael Bloomberg.
In a race dominated by Warren, Khazei was the first Democratic challenger to speak out publicly against her. Last month, he called on Warren to turn down contributions from PACs, a measure he has taken.
One PAC, the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, has already raised $200,000 for Warren. Emily’s List also began fundraising for Warren this summer, and formally endorsed her last month.
Warren’s campaign manager Doug Rubin responded to Khazei’s criticism, telling The Boston Globe that the source of the contributions is irrelevant.
“Anyone who’s going to contribute to Elizabeth Warren’s campaign knows she has been fighting for middle class families her whole life and that’s who she’ll fight for in the Senate. Nothing’s going to change that,” Rubin said.
Khazei asked the public to donate to candidates directly, not PACs.
“Here’s the thing: if you give money to a PAC, who do you empower? You empower the PAC. If you give money directly to a candidate, you empower yourself because you’ve chosen the candidate,” he said.
Khazei promised the crowd in Currier House that he was a different type of candidate.
“I left Harvard, and I went straight to the neighborhoods,” Khazei said in an interview after the event. “I started my career in Mission Hill—not Beacon Hill or Capitol Hill.”
Khazei said he recognized that Warren is ahead of the other Democratic candidates, but said he can close the gap by the time the primary rolls around next year.
“There’s plenty of time. She’s definitely way ahead, I’m the underdog, and I don’t have these big Washington groups behind me.”

A group of alumni who have been protesting the “excessive” compensation packages received by Harvard Management Company executives during the recession received a response from a University official on Monday, which members of the group said was less than satisfactory.
The letter from the alumni argued, among other things, that no executive make more than the University president and that the money saved from reducing executive compensation be used towards stabilizing rising tuition costs, which the group said is a direct result of excessive executive compensation.
The group, which consists mainly of alumni from the Class of 1969, has been protesting what they call “exorbitant” executive compensation at Harvard for over seven years. Since the start of the economic crisis, the group has focused on the steadiness of executive salaries amid drops in the University’s endowment during the recession.
“The top five in the group and Harvard Management as a body did not suffer any significant decline in income as a result of the crash,” said David Kaiser ’69, a member of the group. “The argument that we’ve heard again and again, that compensation is based on performance, doesn’t seem to be a fact.”
In her response to the alumni, Vice President for Alumni Affairs and Development Tamara E. Rogers ’74 defended the HMC’s compensation model.
“We remain fully confident that the HMC model and compensation system saves significant money for the University, relative to the cost of external investment management, and provides the University with the highest level of investment expertise,” Rogers wrote.
University spokesperson Kevin Galvin confirmed the authenticity of the letter. He declined to comment further.
Kaiser said that his group was not pacified by the letter and will continue their campaign.
“It appears to be a no-lose situation for people working at the Harvard Management corporation,” he said. “Until executives are making what we feel is fair, we won’t drop the issue.”
While Kaiser and his group said they feel the money given to HMC managers is excessive, they do acknowledge that it is much more reasonable now than it used to be.
“There were much higher payoffs going on in the 2000s,” Kaiser said. “It’s come down a lot from there.”
The reduced compensation is due, in part, to the restructuring of the Harvard Management Company. HMC President and CEO Jane L. Mendillo has capped managers’ salary in years without economic growth and has created a policy to recover compensation from executives in the event of poor performance.
Rogers’ response to the alumni emphasized these aspects of HMC’s payment system, saying that it is the most economical method for managing the endowment.

As First Class Marshal Bonnie Cao ’12 was getting ready to catch the shuttle from her room in Pfoho last night, she glanced over at her roommate Leslie A. Rea’s computer and saw an email from the Harvard Alumni Association, congratulating Rea ’12 on her election as a House Representative to the Senior Class Committee.
“I’m still kind of in shock that I won,” said Rea, who will now join Cao on the Committee.
Rea and twelve other representatives chosen from each of the undergraduate Houses will join the eight Senior Class Marshals on the Senior Class Committee. The Committee plans events throughout the year, including Senior Bars and Senior Week, functions as a liaison between the class and HAA, and serves as the head of the class after they leave Harvard. A class secretary, treasurer, and webmaster will be elected internally.
While the full list of House Representatives will not be announced until Friday, names have been trickling out since last night. Seniors chose the representatives from their individual houses via an online election open from Saturday to Tuesday.
Recently elected representatives said they are most enthusiastic about helping to plan events for the senior class and encouraging students in their House to participate.
Eager to offer up ideas—including a senior class showing of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals, class t-shirts, and a program to highlight a “senior of the week”—Kirkland representative Kristen E. Arn ’12 said she is excited to help “build class unity.”
The new committee members also said they were excited to represent the interests of their individual houses in the planning of these events. Many of the newly elected SCC members, including Rea and Adams representative Anne G. Douglas ’12, have taken active roles in the leadership of their House Committees.
“I’ve invested a lot of my life in Quincy House,” new representative Collin A. Jones ’12 said. “We will have the potential to be extremely involved in senior class decisions.”
Representatives have also said they look forward to serving the class following graduation, including organizing the planning of future reunions.
“One of my biggest fears with graduating is drifting apart from people,” Arn said. “Having to stay in contact is selfishly comforting.”

The setting was cinematic. In a pivotal game under the lights at Harvard Stadium, the Crimson called on junior Joshua Boyd after starting outside linebacker Blaise Deal went down with an injury. With 18,565 in attendance despite driving rain, Boyd stepped up.
Following a second quarter touchdown from junior Colton Chapple that put Harvard up, 14-0, Brown attempted to answer back, quickly pushing the ball to near midfield. On first down, the Bears’ running back attempted to bounce the run outside.
Boyd quickly read the flow of the play and pounced to make the tackle. Swinging his left arm around the runner, the linebacker struck the ball, popping it free for the Crimson’s first takeaway.
“That was a big play in the game,” Boyd said. “All week, we had been focusing on forcing turnovers after not having any takeaways in week one [against Holy Cross].”
From then on, the defense forced four more turnovers en route to an impressive 24-7 final. Despite coming in only after Deal’s injury, Boyd led the team with 11 tackles, including five solo efforts.
This impressive performance may just be the beginning for the junior linebacker. In the road game last weekend, Boyd recorded a team-high eight total tackles, as the defensive unit smothered Lafayette, holding it to only a field goal in a 31-3 blowout.
“On one hand, you could say [Boyd] has been the most pleasant surprise on the team this year,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “But I’m not surprised … he’s always been a big hitter, but now he can do it all. In my opinion, he is one of the best five linebackers in the Ivy League.”
While Boyd has played consistently over the last two weeks, his contribution to the team over the last three years has been anything but.
Joining the team in 2009, Boyd said he was prepared for his role on special teams and as a rotational player early on. But he was not ready for the leg injury that cut his freshman campaign short.
“He was down for a while,” said Eric Boyd, Joshua’s father, of his son’s injury freshman year. “He was disappointed.”
After an offseason of recovery, Boyd showed flashes of potential in the 2010 campaign while filling in for an injured Alex Gedeon, then a junior.
Boyd recorded a sack in each of the two games he started, including an eight-tackle performance in a week four win at Cornell, all while playing in an ankle brace.
“The experience I got last year playing in all 10 games and getting a lot of playing time in a couple of games definitely helped this year,” Boyd said.
After playing well in limited action last year, Boyd continued to push himself in the offseason, saying that he watched more film and lifted weights more often.
The Boston native also participated in the team’s summer program of workouts at 6 a.m. every Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday. Following his workday at a law firm in downtown Boston, Boyd would come back for more drills and film study at night.
Still recovering from his injury, Boyd said the summer routine helped him feel more comfortable on his feet. Now, he makes members of the opposing backfield squirm.
“He’s a guy you have to account for because he may be biggest hitter in our league at any position,” Murphy said. “Not only can he do his job, but he can really intimidate ball carriers and receivers and he can really get his teammates jacked up.”
Murphy went on to compare Boyd to another playmaker, 12-time NFL pro-bowler Ray Lewis of the Baltimore Ravens. When Boyd patrols the field in his No. 52 jersey, the same number Lewis dons, it’s hard not to see the similarity.
“It’d be easy to say I model myself after Ray Lewis, but I try to do me out there,” Boyd said of the comparison. “I try to be a hard hitter and a good tackler. I try to hang my hat on that.”
Fellow junior linebacker Alex Norman has seen Boyd’s impact on the team in practice as well as on game day.
“He has really provided a spark on defense,” Norman said. “In practice, he has always been the guy to bring down the ball carrier. Now that he has taken on a bigger role after Blaise went down, he’s been even more intense.”
Norman, who is also Boyd’s roommate, still sees the up-and-comer improving.
“He is still getting comfortable with the schemes and the playbook,” Norman said. “He has shown a lot of improvement, but there is still room for him to get better.”

With the Harvard field hockey’s team three-game winning streak in jeopardy on Sunday, the Crimson was saved by an unexpected player: freshman Sydney Jenkins, who scored her third career goal to beat Vermont, 2-1, in overtime.
As Sydney celebrated with her teammates on the field, her sister, Mariel, a junior on the women's lacrosse team, cheered proudly from the stands.
After two years apart, the Jenkins sisters have finally reunited at Harvard.
Since a young age, the sisters have competed together in both lacrosse and field hockey.
In high school, the Jenkins sisters were coined “The Dynamic Duo” and “Double Trouble” because of their unique sister-sister combos.
“I miss playing with her because we would always have sister ‘give-and-goes,’” Sydney said.
Mariel often benefitted from Sydney’s passing prowess.
“Sydney always led the area in assists, and I was pretty high up there in goals, but all of my goals came from Sydney’s assists, so I did little on my own,” Mariel said.
Now playing for the Crimson, the Jenkins girls each chose the sport that best suited their individual strengths.
“Sydney is more of a finesse player,” Mariel explained. “She has really good hands. I’m a little more aggressive, I like to drive to the cage more, and I like more contact.”
Mariel excelled as a lacrosse player at the Princeton Day School, where she scored 118 career goals and was named to the first-team All State in New Jersey.
In her freshman year at Harvard, Mariel started 10 out of the 15 games as a midfielder, scoring three goals and winning seven draws.
Sydney, who was a field hockey all-state prep selection in both 2009 and 2010 and a Junior Olympics pick in 2008, decided to follow Mariel to Cambridge.
“From the second I heard that Sydney was going to Harvard with me, I saw that was going to change my experience completely for the better,” Mariel said.
Mariel wasn’t the only one pleased with Sydney’s decision to come to the Harvard.
“Sydney is a very dynamic player,” junior goalkeeper Cynthia Tassopoulos said. “She can basically go in anywhere and come up with some type of result.”
Sydney has started in four out of the team's nine games so far and was named Ivy League Rookie of the Week on Sept. 5.
The increased competitiveness of college field hockey has been a welcome change for Sydney who is used to playing with less experienced teammates.
“I just love having teammates who play at a high level, because it makes me better and makes me play better,” Sydney said. “Everyone plays for each other. We do not have an individual player on the team.”
While Sydney is at the height of her freshman campaign, Mariel is preparing for her upcoming lacrosse season, in which she too will be making a debut, after sitting out last season due to a knee injury.
Mariel had a long recovery period and is just now starting to feel stronger and participate in her pre-season drills.
“I want to build off what I did freshman year,” Mariel said. “Act like there wasn’t a gap and continue getting better and try not too much to think that I had an injury and was out last season.”
For the Jenkins sisters, athletics runs in their genes.
Their father played football at Duke, and their younger sister, Andrea, is a junior field hockey and lacrosse player in high school.
“Its always been the three of us,” Sydney said. “Sometimes the little one and the older one gang up on me. When we would play house, I would always be the older brother or the dog, the things that no one wants to be.”
Since they are a little too old for playing house nowadays, Sydney and Mariel have found other ways to spend time with each other.
They often study in the library together, and always take a funny picture of themselves looking extra studious to send to their parents.
“I am really happy because we are just as close here as we are at home,” Mariel said. “It’s really great so far.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For his young age, new freshman heavyweight coach William Boyce boasts a substantial and varied history of involvement with Ivy League crew. He was a national champion at Cornell as an undergraduate, served as a coaching intern at Cornell for the men’s lightweight crew, and held a position as assistant coach at Yale for the 2009 and 2010 Ivy League seasons.
In addition to being a national champion, Boyce was named member of the All-Ivy League team and awarded the Cornell Captains’ Award during his senior year. But such an illustrious season did not come effortlessly to Boyce.
After graduating from Princeton Day School, Boyce arrived at Cornell to study film and row for Todd Kennett on the Men’s lightweight rowing team.
As a scrawny freshman at Cornell he was hardly a perfect specimen of the sport.
“He was really weak,” Kennett recalled from his first encounters with Boyce. ”Matter of fact he was physically weak enough that we highly questioned whether he would be able to make a boat”.
But Boyce would go on prove to Kennett and the Ivy League that what he lacked in natural talent he could certainly make up for in determination.
“We loved his attitude and we thought that with his work ethic he might get away with what he wanted to do,” he said. “He was a determined guy; he really knew what he wanted.”
Upon his arrival in Ithaca, Boyce set to work right away and earned his first of many payoffs by making it onto the first freshmen eight.
“When he got here immediately he was one of those guys that you could tell that physically he wasn’t where he needed to be [if he wanted] to be a championship rower,” Kennett said. “But his work ethic alone was just amazing and every year he worked really hard. His freshmen year he got himself pretty darn competitive.”
The following year, he made the junior varsity boat as a sophomore and won a gold medal in the 2006 Eastern Sprints.
“His junior year he was again on the JV, but he was exceedingly competitive and he had a bunch of younger guys in it with him now,” Kennett said.
Boyce was competitive again in the Eastern Sprints as the JV boat earned a silver medal.
“They led the sprints the whole way and ending up losing in the last 10 seconds,” the Big Red coach remembered.
But all of Boyce’s small victories were only precursors to his big payoff during his final season with Cornell.
“His senior year he came back, and he was a huge player right away,” Kennett said.
Boyce earned a spot as the six seat of the lightweight varsity eight in 2008, and helped his boat to first place at both Eastern Sprints and the IRA National Championships.
At IRAs, the boat came from behind to win in the final 500 meters of the race. After claiming the national title, Boyce and his team reached the quarterfinals at the Henley Royal Regatta.
“They were a pretty darn good boat,” Kennett praised. “And [Boyce] was a big part of it … he was going to get out of it what he put into it.”
After his season and graduation from Cornell, Boyce remained in the rowing community and became a coaching intern at Cornell for the 2008-2009 season.
He then left Cornell and joined the Bulldogs. Boyce was assistant coach on the varsity men’s heavyweight team for the 2009 and 2010 seasons before joining the Crimson squad as the freshmen men’s crew coach this year.
“We’re just really pleased [to have Boyce]”, said Harvard heavyweight coach Harry Parker. “He has a great background as an oarsman at Cornell ... very successful, a good student of coaching … We think it’s going to work out really well.”
Boyce’s trials, experiences, and successes as a rower have definitely made a contribution to his coaching abilities.
“I hate coaching against him,” Kennett said. “And [Cornell is] not looking forward to it because we know he works really really hard at what he does … and he knows how to be determined and persevere.“
Folks at Harvard have already caught on to Boyce’s coaching skills.
“He obviously knows what it takes to win; there is no doubt there,” captain Mike DiSanto said. “I think that he pushes the freshmen to work pretty hard.”
Boyce is looking forward to using his experiences to provide freshmen with the opportunity to thrive as competitors.
“I definitely enjoyed being on a team that if you worked hard you have a chance to be successful,” he says. “I want to be able to give back to the sport in that way and allow these guys to have their own successful experiences.”

On Saturday night, something was amiss in the Winthrop House dining hall. The Winthrop House IM Sports board, usually prominently displayed in the dining hall, went missing.
"At first, we thought people at a party might have taken it," said Winthrop IM Sports Rep Andrew Y. Badger '12, "but the next morning, there was a piece of paper in the void where the board usually is, saying 'We took your board, and next we're going to take your cup.'"
The board was later returned with a conspicuous new addition: a drawing of a penguin. This leads Badger to believe the culprit was Quincy House, especially after an incident at a recent intramural game.
"We had a close soccer game where we won in overtime against them, and they disputed a call," Badger said.
The intimidation attempt, however, may have backfired.
"It ended up working as a great motivational tool to keep the fire lit after a long period of IM dominance. 'If you want to take the cup, you have to earn it' was our reply. If you want to play it on the field, you're more than welcome."

An iconic University relic had finally cracked under pressure. The Memorial Church bell, known by most freshmen as the "8:40 bell," is out of commission. But the question remains: was this a natural death or a murder?
In the days before the Memorial Bell cracked, freshmen campaigning for spots in the college's Undergraduate Council were arguing for its very removal. With suspicious slogans such as "kill the 8:40 bell," there is reason to question whether these Yard representatives had anything to do with the bell's demise.
Some of these UC reps claim that this was never their intention.
"I never committed to killing the 8:40 bell," said Elm Yard Representative Ting-Ting Liu '15.  "I'm not that violent, I promise!"
Others, however, are less than upset about the loss of the morning bell.
"I feel the way my constituents feel: blessed to sleep past 8:41," said Crimson Yard Representative Kevin Huynh '15.
Harvard students, especially freshmen, no longer have a default alarm clock on weekday mornings. Many have actually celebrated the bell's death and reveled in the extra time to attach their faces to their pillows before class.
"If the bell didn't crack, I probably would have dressed up in my black Spiderman outfit and hired a bunch of students from one of the Harvard Engineering groups to bring it down and lay it on the head of the John Harvard Statue," said Oak Yard Representative Alexander J. Spencer '15.
Luckily for those students who are suffering from bell withdrawal, a plan is in the works. Although no long-term decision has been reached regarding the future of the bell, Memorial Church Epps Fellow Nathaniel P. Katz shared that "in the next week or two, a speaker will be installed in the bell tower that will toll at the same times the actual bell rang in the past."
Sorry, folks. Get all the late-morning sleep you can now because next week, the bell will be back.
