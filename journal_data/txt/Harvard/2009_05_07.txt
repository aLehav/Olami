After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Social space at Harvard is a real problem. But the Undergraduate Council’s potential purchase of 45 Mt. Auburn Street is an even bigger one. While admirably motivated, the plan is not a feasible solution and should be abandoned immediately. We commend the UC for working to solve the important issue of social space on campus, but its fixation on purchasing this particular property is unwise. 
The UC has apparently failed to take into account the numerous flaws in its acquisition plan, which undermine the entire endeavor. This past Tuesday, less than three weeks before the end of exams, all Harvard undergraduates received “personal” e-mails soliciting their services as paid fundraisers for the capital campaign the UC will launch over the summer to raise approximately $6 million in no fewer than 16 months. Given the scope of the project and the current economic climate, this lofty goal seems highly unrealistic. However, anything shy of this target will likely be insufficient to complete the expensive purchase. Exactly how much is needed is still unknown, as the sale price for the building has yet to be determined, even though one would have hoped that an elementary sense of prudence would have kept the UC from launching this initiative without finalizing such a crucial detail. But whatever the final price turns out to be—some estimates predict as much as $4 million—the fundraising required to generate it will far exceed reasonable expectations.
The UC asserts that its capital campaign is open-ended and will produce valuable funds even if the purchase of 45 Mt. Auburn never materializes. But this logic fails to consider that, while collecting $6 million from recession-pinched alums for the clear goal of a building purchase is difficult enough, trying to raise the same amount with only a vague appeal to “social space” would be flatly impossible.
And regardless of whether it has the fundraising capabilities to meet its impossibly high targets, the UC may not even be able to receive donations given its legal status. As of now, it has received a $4,000 donation that it can only accept either via a “gift account” or “pledge account” created in conjunction with the university, since the UC has yet to earn full 501(c)(3) status.  
Should the gods grant the UC the money (and the legal status) required to purchase 45 Mt. Auburn, it still would not be out of the woods. The price of the building itself is nowhere near the end of the expenses this initiative would incur. In the unlikely event that the building can be purchased, there will still be substantial renovation costs to meet. Architects have estimated that the total costs for these upgrades would be approximately $500,000, yet another large sum the UC must feel capable of paying. On top of everything else, there has even been talk of adding additional floors to the building, which makes the entire project appear like a bit of a farce. 
Given what the UC stands to pay and what it stands to gain, it seems safe to say that purchasing 45 Mt. Auburn may not be the best idea possible. Current plans seem to call for the UC to shell out millions of dollars for a partial share in a decaying building. Under the current proposal, the building’s top two floors would remain inaccessible to the UC, leaving only the ground floor and basement, which requires heavy renovations to be usable. Even if the project did succeed, the potential improvements to student life to be derived from such a small space would not be significant enough to justify the incredible obstacles the UC must overcome. Especially given the restrictions that would be imposed on the UC’s use of the building—and the plans to use part of it as UC offices—45 Mt. Auburn is not at all the space students envision when they imagine the student center Harvard needs. Another coffee shop and some additional rooms available for rent are nowhere near the top of anyone’s priorities at the moment, and the UC should be no exception. 
It is also particularly troubling that, as per the seller’s stipulations, a large portion of the building would have to be set aside for “progressive social organizations,” a term that, while nebulous, connotes a certain ideological leaning the UC has no business promoting with its real estate. The UC is a body intended to represent Harvard’s entire undergraduate population, and no social space it attempts to create should ever alienate those students whose political views may not necessarily be classified as “progressive.” 
But these are distant concerns given the more immediate problems associated with the purchase. The UC’s misguided attempt to buy 45 Mt. Auburn is likely to fail, and such a failure would diminish the UC’s already scant credibility and distract it from important items on its agenda, such as responding to the massive budget cuts sweeping the university. 
Before a recipe for disaster becomes a very real problem, the UC should reconsider its decision to embark on a capital campaign to nowhere.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Dick Cheney commented last month that the Obama administration’s policies were making Americans less safe, Robert Gibbs, Obama’s press secretary, responded with the following comment: “Well, I guess Rush Limbaugh was busy, so they trotted out the next-most-popular member of the Republican cabal.”
This kind of rhetoric, which makes Republicans seem more like a conspiratorial enemy than a political party, clearly hampers any efforts at bipartisanship. But there is nothing new about it—this is the same kind of language Obama used in defeating John McCain in the general election last November. Indeed, the Obama administration continues to deploy many of the campaign tactics it used in the run-up to the election, even now that it has taken power. Behind the facade of hope and change lies a cynical attitude of vote-getting and shallow ideological persuasion that only hurts Obama’s chances at truly reaching the American public.
Politician and journalist Sidney Blumenthal has referred to such perpetual election strategies of this kind as “permanent campaigns,” an apt term for the politicking mentality the administration continues to harbor. Since his election, for instance, Obama has delivered a significant number of speeches in swing states where he will need to retain votes in 2012. That the 2012 campaign is already on his mind suggests more of a desire for power than real, content-based change. Instead of focusing his undivided attention on the challenges currently facing our nation’s citizens, Obama seems to be focused on potential political scandals over his cabinet appointments and difficulties in maintaining Republican support on his bailout plan. With his focus and resources divided in this way, Obama cannot give the problems currently facing the American populace the attention they deserve.
In addition to diverting the president’s resources, Obama’s permanent campaign marks the abandonment of his election promises to establish bipartisanship. Obama’s rhetoric has consistently put his own ideas in direct conflict with those of Republicans. Republicans are portrayed as regressive and unpopular, and the administration’s speeches often associate them with unpopular figures like Rush Limbaugh—as demonstrated in Gibbs’ sremarks—rather than with more articulate figures like Charles Krauthammer. It is this type of one-sided political thought that has contributed to the lack of Republican support in either the House or the Senate for Obama’s proposed budget last month as well as the failure of his $787 billion stimulus package to win a single Republican vote in the House in January. It is clear to Republicans that Obama is not fully committed to bipartisanship quite yet.
Granted, although Obama’s “permanent campaign” may not be an efficient or beneficial one, it is prudent politically. Some have claimed that, in the age of 21st-century politics, when campaigns begin two years prior to elections and opponents are unwilling to compromise, “permanent campaigns” are the only feasible means of maintaining support. If Obama does desire to win the 2012 election, he must start now in order to avoid losing ground to opponents who do not have to face the demands of the presidency. But, although a “permanent campaign” may be politically savvy (as Obama’s strategists undoubtedly advise him), it is not politically advantageous for the American populace. Obama is the nation’s leader now, not the Democratic Party’s candidate, and his primary concern should be the welfare of America’s citizens, not the service of his own political interests.
The idea of a “permanent campaign” can be a beneficial one for political administrations when handled appropriately. At best, it increases accountability by reminding politicians that voters are still evaluating their performance in office and will continue to evaluate them when the next election comes around. It encourages officials to inform citizens actively about their plans in an effort to gain popular support for their policies. And it keeps voters aware and prevents political ignorance or misinformation. In some cases, the Obama administration has used these tactics effectively. 
Unfortunately, most of Obama’s strategies have been fostering the opposite sentiments. His permanent campaign encourages suspicion in place of trust, partisanship in place of unity, hopelessness in place of change. Ironically, the continuation of the policies that ensured his campaign’s success has forced Obama to abandon many of the promises he made during that campaign in the first place. The administration that promised to bring change to America has instead brought only more division—a division that may ensure Obama’s election in 2012 but will sacrifice his message in the process.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the spirit of springtime renewal, a Harvard student group recently got a facelift. Harvard Men Against Rape re-launched itself last month as MenSpeakUp.org, a media campaign seeking to raise awareness about gender-inequality issues. Unfortunately, far from being a refreshing alternative to the tired rhetoric of more established campaigns against sexual violence, MenSpeakUp is not only uninspired, but it also serves as yet another reminder of a movement that ultimately harms women more than it helps them.
MenSpeakUp is a group with big plans. At the site’s Cambridge launch event in April, Hugo Van Vuuren ’07, a leader of MenSpeakUp efforts, suggested that the campaign has set its sights on the world beyond Harvard. “Because if I am the 14-year-old guy in Nebraska, I will see that these cool guys at Harvard care about this, so if I care about this, it won’t make me any less cool,” he told his audience. 
Van Vuuren’s self-congratulatory Nebraska-bashing may indicate the group’s sincere hopes of effecting positive change, but such a vision also embodies the elitist idealism and lackluster social theory that characterizes the campaign. In this affair, the old adage rings true: The road to hell is paved with good intentions. Van Vuuren and his colleagues have fashioned themselves as warriors of gender equality while failing to consider what they’re promoting—essentially, a program that misrepresents the reality of modern sexual violence and reduces women to passive victims.
These problems are neither new nor uncommon. What has happened at Harvard—and to the gender equality movement in general—is something that is as dangerous as it is strange. In our post-sexual liberation society, a woman is now encouraged to embrace her sexual autonomy until an unspoken, invisible line dictated and measured only within her own head is crossed, at which point she is catapulted into decorated victim status. In advocating this philosophy, the movement reduces women to passive victims and, worse still, takes away from the women who are victims of truly egregious sexual violence.
A brief skim of MenSpeakUp’s website betrays this sort of haphazard agenda. “Because not being a rapist is not enough,” writes one member. In a video, another encourages his fellow males to speak out against rape jokes. (Is this the sort of innovative thinking that makes the Harvard man?) But where the site is not merely bland, it is alarmist and misleading. The site provides little in the way of actual rape statistics, except for reporting that, “by most estimates, between one in three to one in five women will experience sexual or domestic violence at the hands of a male friend, partner, spouse, or date.” 
In promoting this statistic, MenSpeakUp fails to elaborate. If it did, it would become clear that this statistic does not refer exclusively to women who were the victims of serious sexual assault—for instance, rape—but includes women who report so little as having engaged in unwanted sexual acts. This is a fairly low threshold, if ever there were one. 
In her 1994 book, The Morning After, Katie Roiphe ’90 traced the rapid rise of movements like Take Back the Night at Harvard as well as the culture surrounding this increased “awareness.” Roiphe argued that women must take at least some responsibility for what goes on in her sexual interactions, in light of the active role they tend to play in their own day-to-day lives. For the most part, Roiphe’s observations were dismissed as anti-women. 
Fifteen years later, Roiphe’s criticisms still ring true. At Harvard, administrators who have attempted to inject a similar dose of reality into the sexual violence debate have been ridiculed. As noted by Sahil K. Mahtani ’08, a seemingly anomalous one-time poster to MenSpeakUp.org, when former College Dean Harry R. Lewis ’68 encouraged female undergraduates to walk with companions late at night, he was accused of “blaming the victim.”
For better or for worse, we are no longer a part of a society that encourages women to be chaste or careful—that is, a society in which reports of sexual assault were likely just that, rather than intimate exchanges that went on too long or signals that were more mixed than we might have hoped. The mentality in which we blindly protect the women in our lives from supposed male predators is not compatible with our can-do credo, through which we encourage the same women to grab life by the horns, even in the realm of sexual risk-taking. What we need in the gender-equality debate is not another half-assed website, but instead a campaign that can effectively adjust to our times. 
The very name “MenSpeakUp” is indicative of this awkward collision of traditional morality with a left-wing agenda. The idea that what has been missing from this movement was a gaggle of boys swooping in to save the day suggests that women can’t take care of themselves. That is a notion that, when reinforced, is unlikely to help women to feel more in control of their sexual interactions. And this is perhaps the cherry on the sundae that is MenSpeakUp’s failure—however benevolent its intentions, the group’s very basis is an act of dominating women, not of empowering them.  
In revamping itself, MenSpeakUp had a chance to style itself as a bearer of straight talk and a mandate for cultural change. Instead, it chose to promote old rhetoric and stifle the chance for new debate. The group’s entry onto the scene will do little more than to push the chance for real dialogue farther away from the surface. Inevitably, the people this hurts the most are the true victims of sexual violence whose stories are drowned out by the distractions of an exaggerated and intellectually bankrupt movement.

To the editors:
The April 30 editorial cartoon by “Samuel L. Clemens” continues the fine work I’ve come to expect from The Crimson over the years. (Anyone remember the “presidential neckwear” cartoon published shortly after the announcement of our first female president? Allow me to jog your memory: contrasting with a necktie, President Faust’s accessory was a dog collar and leash.) 
It’s nice to know that you’re only looking at your female classmates as faceless T&A in the summer, “Sam,” but perhaps you’d do us the courtesy of using your real name next time so that all women with a shred of good sense can avoid you. 
Editorial cartoonists shouldn’t have to hide behind pseudonyms. If the editorial board can’t find cartoonists who can manage intelligent (and non-sexist) humor--and who are willing to publicly back their work--maybe it’s time to re-run old Sock Full of Quarters strips.

To the editors:
I had to laugh at the unnamed writing program director who said Tom Jehn wasn’t “an intellectual force in the field.”  As someone who taught Expos for eight years, I can attest that there are no “intellectual forces” in the field, which I wouldn’t say is even a “field.”  Yes, there is something called “composition studies” (sometimes “composition theory”),  there is at least one professional society, and there are peer-reviewed journals, but all that can be safely ignored by any good writing teacher, as indeed was the case by most of my colleagues during my time.  Pedagogy is important, and we were lucky to have Gordon Harvey (author of the Harvard standby Writing with Sources) to teach us how to teach writing until he was mysteriously removed in 2006, but I would describe writing instruction as an artisan’s trade that is hampered by theory just as would be true in watchmaking or leather-working.  
As his colleague for eight years and friend for longer, I can say that Tom Jehn is the perfect choice to lead Expos.  As the article’s other quotations suggest, he has spent two intense years rebuilding a program with transparency, decency, and new ideas.  A superb teacher himself—perhaps the article could have given his average Q rating over the last 10 years? —he has proven himself an effective and trusted administrator.  He’s also pretty bright: an intellectual force I would say, if the term wasn’t already debased.  Harvard’s undergraduates will benefit from a master teacher in charge more than from any leading composition scholar it may find elsewhere.

To the editors:
I read with interest last week’s article by Edward-Michael Dussom and Evan T. R. Rosenman about the panel discussion of ROTC challenges and am writing to address the concern that some students voiced about how the receipt of a ROTC scholarship affects a student’s financial aid.   
   Scholarship eligibility at Harvard College is entirely need-based and is determined by the Committee on Financial Aid after careful review of a student’s available financial resources, including family income and assets and other outside sources of assistance.  If the receipt of ROTC or any other source of outside scholarship assistance meets a student’s full need, there is no remaining eligibility for Harvard scholarship assistance.  However, if the ROTC or other source of outside funding does not fully meet a student’s need, then Harvard scholarship assistance is awarded to do so. In other words, ROTC scholarships are treated in the same manner as are all other sources of outside awards.  Students with questions about our financial-aid guidelines are encouraged to visit our website at www.fao.fas.harvard.edu or to give us a call at 617-495-1581.

Reading period?  Drinking period?  Catching up on Gossip Girl period?No matter how you roll during these next couple of weeks, some things will undoubtedly happen.  You’ll shower less.  You’ll eat more.  You’ll get a B+ in that core whose reading you’ve been ignoring.       And the most universal truth: everyone around you will become a little bit more irritating.  So in my lifelong quest to make this campus less annoying, here are some ways to negotiate these stressful weeks:1. If I’m working at a table in the d-hall, don’t convene a meeting of your fifty best friends next to me when there are several empty tables all around. When I’m frantically hunched over a computer, I’m probably not indicating a desire to hear about how drunk you got last night.  The glares I am shooting you are not my ways of showing my disproval that you so texted him last night when you shouldn’t have. 2. Do not try to compete to show that you have more work than I do.  I get that everyone wants to feel like a martyr.  “You have two papers?  Yeah, that’s rough.  I have two papers due by lunchtime, after which I have five finals and seven summer applications.  Oh, and all of my classes are still meeting.”  Really?  Well then stop chatting it up in the Lamont café and go do some work.3. Don’t announce to the world when you finish your finals by changing your Gchat status to “DONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :-D”  Here’s a shocker: some of the people on your contacts may actually still have finals (!!).  So save your glee till after the last day.  Except, even then, try not to brag about your summer employment—some of us will be using our reading periods to figure that one out.

For most college students, the formerly dreaded SAT has become nothing more than an irrelevant number from the past. But for Jason Y. Shah ’11, the plight of SAT prep for high school students is the basis of his enterprise, INeedAPencil.com. Unlike more famous companies such as Kaplan and Princeton Review, which often charge several hundred dollars for a preparatory course, is geared toward low-income and underprivileged students.“WRITING” THE PROGRAMShah says he was inspired to start the project in fall 2006 as a junior in high school. While helping some sixth graders write essays about their Thanksgiving plans, one student asked Shah how to spell the word “ball” three times. “That really hit me hard,” says Shah.He began to think of ways to approach this problem. The first project was an in-person tutoring program, but Shah says he found himself unsatisfied. “You end up doing a lot of the same things over and over again,” he says. “It’s not rewarding sometimes. That’s when the idea for the Web site was born.”Launched in April 2007, INeedAPencil.com offers SAT prep for free. It provides lessons and practice test questions, and users are able to customize their sessions to fit a certain time frame. But INeedAPencil.com also adds special features to the typical program. These include a visual progress chart that keeps track of completed lessons, a score projector that calculates the actual expected test score based on aggregate performance, and even a “confidence calibrator” that allows users to indicate the level of confidence in their answers. “It hones your ability to decide whether to risk answering a question or not,” says Shah.Although the Web site does not offer live support through video or chat, Shah does maintain 24-hour e-mail support for users. He says that he commonly receives e-mails from users seeking advice about college selection.The results speak for themselves. Since the Web site’s launch, it has already garnered a base of 24,000 students. And not only is the number of users impressive, but the program seems to achieve its intended goal: according to Shah, a 200-point increase in total score is typical over the length of the course.  THE “MATH” TO SUCCESSOne of INeedAPencil.com’s success stories is Evan M. Kendall, currently a junior at Sharon High School in Sharon, Mass. He discovered the Web site through a Facebook group. “It was a really helpful tool,” he says. “It was free, it was at my convenience, and it worked.” Apart from using the practice tests on CollegeBoard’s Web site, Kendall says exclusively used INeedAPencil.com for test prep. “It’s very interactive, and it just seems more hands-on than, say, Kaplan or Barron’s, where it’s so large that you feel insignificant,” says Kendall. “This made you feel more like it’s personalized.”Kendall says that he took the SAT in March as practice and that he had intended to take them again last weekend. From beginning his preparation until March, his score jumped from 1800 to 2050. His strength lies in math but that his performance on the writing section could use improvement. He found the question generator very helpful in keeping his practice tailored toward his weaknesses. The one potential drawback? The lack of practice for the essay: “That might be the only setback that there is right now, because it’s harder to grade an essay than a multiple choice section with an obvious answer,” he says.Kendall adds that INeedAPencil.com also helped him with his college search. “From the Web site I see that my scores fit in the areas of applicants that applied to some college that I am interested in,” such as the University of Virginia or New York University, he says. “I feel that with the improvement that my scores have made, I have a legitimate chance of getting into those schools.”“READING” THE FUTUREShah says that currently he is uncertain about the future of INeedAPencil.com. “I’ll keep it running perpetually,” he says. “But I might find somebody else to run it and still continue to own it so I can start new projects, continue expanding.”Shah says his interests lie primarily in the social aspect of entrepreneurship. He has taken Professor David L. Ager’s course Sociology 159: “Social Entrepreneurship,” and INeedAPencil.com won the social entrepreneurship category of the I3 Harvard College Innovation Challenge this year. His I3 presentation was impressive enough to attract the attention of Sunil S. Nagaraj, a Harvard Business School student who had already known Shah for some time and is now acting as his mentor.However, Nagaraj does say that the Web site may change direction. “What Jason and I have been struggling with is, should this remain a social enterprise or should it become a for-profit enterprise?” he says. Although this decision is yet to be made, the current focus is to make small changes such as improving the site’s visual layout. Nonetheless, Shah’s mentors seem impressed with his current success, and it is likely that he will have a future in entrepreneurship. “Jason is incredibly charismatic, and he has the right balance of substance and form,” says Nagaraj. “He’s got one of the most important qualities that entrepreneurs need to have: he’s a go-getter,” adds Roy I. Ben-Dor, another HBS student and mentor to Shah. Kendall says he has spoken to Shah once or twice about his program to compliment him on the site’s success. “It’s nice to see when high school and college students focus on not only their peers,” he says. “For instance, he came up with this in high school, but then after high school he kept up with the idea and is still working on it.”

WHAT’S THIS ALL ABOUT?Tucked away on Claverly’s ground floor is an elusive organization that remains foreign to many students at Harvard—the Harvard Outing Club. Enter the Outing Club’s “office” at 15 Linden Street and you will find a bevy of skis, snowshoes, antlers, bicycles, and ice axes lining the walls, kayaks and canoes hanging from the ceiling, and a sign above the door that reads “HOC All Welcome” next to a painting of a moose with a halo.This image seems particularly appropriate for a group that worships the outdoors. Incoming President Rebecca R. Hersher ’11 says, “If you’ve never summited a mountain before it’s almost like a religious experience. You get to the top and the wind blows in your hair. You can’t even imagine it.”“There’s no excuse not to leave campus,” says Peter F. Hedman ’10, the club’s vice president. “Our main goal is to get people OUT. It’s pretty hard to get Harvard students to leave...it is possible, though.”The Outing Club provides students with “anything you would want for backpacking, plus snowshoes, skis, kayaks” as part of their gear cooperative aimed at encouraging and supporting those who yearn to explore the outdoors, explains outgoing president James S. Miller ’09. For a mere $10 a semester, Harvard students, faculty, affiliates can register to be a member of the co-op. But HOC is pretty laid back in terms of membership. “Anyone can become a member,” says Hersher. “We’re not particularly discriminating,” Miller echoes.The gear cooperative however, is just one facet of the club. They also run trips nearly every weekend, and an increasingly popular intercession outing.“We had a ton of interest in our intercession trip this year,” says Miller. “We have a cabin we share with the Appalachian Mountain Club. It was a huge logistical challenge, coordinating 300 people, and a couple hundred pounds of food and sending out four or five trips.”a day. I think it shows how our capacity has grownOUTING STUDENTSAccording to Miller, the Harvard Outing Club was founded in 1939, though there is some speculation that it may have began as early as the 1920s, and a 1923 Crimson article seems to acknowledge its existence.“I think it’s sort of waxed and waned over the years,” Miller says. “Five or ten years ago it was less active but in the past five or six years it has had a resurgence.”Indeed, Hersher claims, “we have 1500 or 1000 on the e-mail list, I’d say probably 200 active members on a given year, and probably 30 current Harvard affiliates plus 20 who are loosely affiliated or living off campus. Like most outdoor communities, it is pretty amorphous.”Miller, however, says that membership is equally balanced between men and women. “I think this year we actually have more female leaders than men.”The “leaders” Miller refers to are students who have taken part in the Outing Club’s Leader Training Program. An integral part of the club, the program prepares students for safety and survival in the outdoors. Consisting of a number of workshops that focus on skills such as compass and map navigation and weather preparedness, the program features two wilderness-training trips: one in the winter and one that is geared more towards backpacking.“All leaders also get wilderness First Aid and CPR certification,” says Miller. “In order for it to be an official trip, at least one leader needs to have [that] training or higher. Some of the leaders are wilderness First Responders or wilderness EMTs.Though the leader training may strike some as overly cautious, the Outing Club has learned that it is better to be safe than sorry. During spring break of 2006, a canoe trip in Charleston, South Carolina put the Outing Club to the test. Two students flipped over in rough waves and were carried away from the rest of the group. It was nearly an hour before the two were rescued by a Coast Guard helicopter and boat.Prospective members can rest assured though: Miller says nothing similar has occurred since. THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOXThough the Outing Club has many enthusiastic, nature-loving members, “there isn’t a lot of presence for people who aren’t sure if they’re interested in the outdoors,” Hersher says. She hopes to expand membership to less forest-friendly students during her tenure as president. Mette S. Andersen ’11, the club’s treasurer, agrees. “We hope to get more people involved. It’s really a great resource for students.”Though the Outing Club has a good relationship with the Harvard Mountaineering Club and even shares some members with them, the two clubs are not officially affiliated. “The Mountaineering Club is a little more exclusive because not everyone can go rock-climbing. You need physical strength, endurance, or innate ability,” Hersher says. The Outing Club, on the other hand “is designed for anyone who can walk. If you’ve never put on hiking boots before we’d love to have you.”Outing Club trips run the gamut, from cross-country skiing, to biking, hiking, and canoeing. As Miller puts it, “pretty much we do anything that does not involve ropes.”Hersher recalls a particularly memorable experience, when after hiking up Mount Lafayette through thick snow in January, she and her friends decided to sled down the peak. “We just sled down the entire thing,” she reminisces. “It was like a roller coaster, but so much better. I hit a couple trees, but I did it!”For those who aren’t naturally lured to the Outing Club by an innate love of nature, the Outing Club’s largest obstacle seems to be its lack of advertising.“I think the people that know about it are excited about it. But not everybody knows what we do,” says Hedman. “Basically our job is to get people gear for almost free, and then go out and have fun. And there’s no catch.”He adds, “We basically are here to serve the undergraduate community. Our sign says ‘all welcome.’ And it’s true.”

Move aside trayless dining, looks like Harvard’s onto a more convenient way to save the environment. Katharine (“Katie”) S. Walter ’10 and Karen A. McKinnon ’10, co-chairs of Harvard’s Environmental Action Committee (EAC), have enabled students to expend their eco-friendly energy in a much easier way. In fact, it’s as simple as riding a bike—a bike that’s made entirely out of salvaged and recycled parts, that is. The EAC launched the VeriFast program Saturday, April 25, allowing students to rent bikes from their Houses at no charge. The EAC was able to launch the program with a $6,500 grant it received from the Green Crimson Fund.     “You can go to the super’s office at any time and reserve a bike,” says Walter, noting that bikes are only currently available at Mather and Cabot Houses. “But we are hoping to expand in the fall if all goes well.”In the first week and a half following the program launch, more than 20 bikes had already been taken out. “It’s already popular in Europe, Portland, and Washington, D.C. And the city of Boston is planning to implement [a bike-sharing program]. I think it’s great to see Harvard taking similar action,” says Ellen M. McDonough ’09.But why bikes? David W. McCahill ’09, who works for Quad Bikes, a non-profit bicycle shop that seeks to raise the consciousness of the Harvard community about bike riding, was responsible for constructing the VeriFast bikes.“It’s great because its recycling at its purest form, you take stuff that’s been abandoned and make it useful,” said McCahill. Walter also espouses the effectiveness of using recycled materials—and bikes themselves—to instill eco-friendly values.  “We think it shows great visible commitment to the cause,” says Walter. “And we believe that if you bike in college, you’ll bike for life. It can become a habit.”

Ok, so you know that episode of the HBO show “The Wire” where Avon Barksdale says to Marlo Stanfield, “It’s all in the game” to describe the complications and stresses inherent in being a kingpin in the Baltimore drug trade? If you have no idea what the crap I’m talking about, The Wire, aka the sweetest show ever, is about crime and policing in the age of post-industrial urban decay, and the characters traditionally say “all in the game” to describe the triumphs, defeats and harsh realities of operating in the criminal underworld. Sort of like “that’s life” or “shit happens, bra” but cooler.Now bear with me, because I think that this phrase has deep meaning for us as Harvard students as well. You know what? You’re going to have to bear with me, because I’m the one writing this Endpaper, and if you don’t, you won’t have anything to read and you’ll look unpopular if you’re in the dining hall by yourself right now. BURNED!!!Anywho, I think one of the most important things I’ve picked up here in the 02138, something I’ll carry with me all my life, is how to put a positive, life-affirming twist on this maxim of “all in the game” and live by that motto. As we close out this school year, it is my humble hope that this knowledge will be enriching for your life as well. Here’s an added bonus: inserting the phrase, “yo it’s all in the game” into your conversations, accompanied by a ruggedly philosophical facial expression and an easy shrug of the shoulders, will make you seem effortlessly cool. Try it right now! See? Pretty sweet. No need to thank me.Navigating the tricky waters of the Harv can be tough. It’s for sure got its ups and downs, baby, its strikes and gutters. You win some, you lose some. Sometimes you’re the Louisville slugger, sometimes you’re the ball. Sometimes Drew Faust gives you lemons, and you try to make lemonade, but you realize that the ice machine in the dining hall is turned off, and so you have lukewarm lemonade. That sucks.For me, Harvard has been a place that involves high risk and high reward. What I mean by that is, you are confronted on a daily basis with opportunities put yourself out there, go for the gold, or stick your proverbial neck out. And sometimes, that neck gets bitten by a vampire, and we’re talking tough-ass vampires that are much scarier than the vampires in stupid Twilight. Every time you write a paper, try out for an activity, or play a game of beer pong on a Tuesday night, you open yourself up to the possibility of not succeeding. Maybe you get smacked with the devilish B-/C+ on that paper, or forget your lines at the play tryout and feel like a doofus in front of some stylish actor-types, or worse, lose so bad at pong that you have to take a naked lap through Mather courtyard.Bad news bears, right? Well I’m here to say this. Maybe not bad news bears. Maybe okay news bears. You wanna know why? Because failure is “all in the game” baby.I really think we might do well to take a minute, just sit right there, I’ll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air.Wait no, that’s not what I meant. I meant to say, I really think we might do well to take a minute and relax about the possibility and inevitability of screwing up every once in a while. Harvard is a competitive place, and we like to avoid showing our faults if we can. But the reality is, when you take advantage of the good aspects of this school and lead an involved life, there will be times things don’t work out as hoped for. But it doesn’t make sense in the face of failure to simply shut off and retreat, because you know what? The game was meant to be played. Looking back on my time here, I’m really thankful that the game exists at all, that Harvard, even though it hasn’t always been easy, offers so many chances to take those risks and have some adventures.Let’s look at a brief case study. Last weekend it was sunny—a grand day for a soccer game. Enter the cast of characters: Walter “Waltburger” Howell, Matt Sundquist aka Butt Buttquist aka BBQ, Clem “Nickname” Wright, and Yours Truly. We were just runnin’ around soccering, or as the Europeans say, “footballing” when Walter and Clem accidentally collided knee-to knee in an unbridled explosion of full contact dude-ness.BAM! Walt was on the ground, obviously in a bunch of pain. His knee had gotten smacked pretty good. Now, at this point, a lesser man might have lashed out at Clem for his role in having facilitated the collision. But no. There was no blame to be placed here, no mud to sling. Walty understood that knee collisions where a very real possibility in a heated game of shirtless soccer, and after a brief string of profanity immediately following the event, the ferocious competitors were reconciled. We all continue to be good friends to this day. That’s “all in the game” mentality in action. DEAL WITH IT.These college dayz have been a wild ride. I want to thank my parents, my sister, my friends (you know who you is!), “The Wire”, Peet’s Coffee, my teachers, and Jamison and Asli for letting me rant one last time in their otherwise highly professional and awesome publication. Stay frosty, Harvard, and remember, it’s all in the game, baby. PEACE, I’M OUT! H. Max Huber ’09 is an English concentrator in Mather House. He prefers to be called Hans.

Last month, Harvard-grads-turned-rock-stars Chester French released their premiere album, “Love the Future.” They also made a few “colorful” additions to their online store. Alongside records, t-shirts, and stickers, dedicated fans can now purchase the “ENDURANCE Package,” which includes a work-out session with band members D.A. Wallach and Maxwell C. Drummey ’07 and a game of two-on-two basketball. The “Slumber Party Package” (you provide the sleeping bags and cartoon-themed pillowcases) features breakfast for the family prepared by the band, as well as a serenade of your mother on the ukulele. The “African Safari Package,” costs $75,000. FM interviewed the dynamic duo on their innovative marketing scheme, their new album, and their life as rock stars. 1. Fifteen Minutes: What was the inspiration behind your newest additions to the online store?D.A. Wallach: We thought it would be cool if our supporters could buy stuff directly from us. On the bottom end we’re offering something comparable to iTunes, our digital iTunes. We wanted to give people as many options as possible...We wanted to give  stickers, t-shirts, records. Put down 20 bucks on a record and you actually get some cool stuff with it.  2. FM: How about the more unconventional packages? D.A.: Fortunately we’ve had a lot of interest in these packages. In addition to making money, we’re also starting a movement. We’re gonna fight childhood and adult obesity, with one endurance event at a time. And since there are two of us we might be able to do two endurance events at a time some day.  3. FM: So are you looking at cardiovascular health here? Max Drummey: We’re doing Jane Fonda. Shit, dude. A combination between Jane Fonda and Ron Jeremy.  We can last however long we need to last. And also, body hair—we’re somewhere in between the two of them.D.A.: When people look at the endurance package, they’re not just looking at cardio strength, they’re going to gain mental fortitude, have higher self-esteem. It’s really like a holistic approach to wellness.  4. FM: Any takers yet?D.A.: We’ve done a lot of e-mails. Unfortunately because we’re off tour right now we can’t start them right away, cause we’d be committing to doing it in the person’s city. What we do is we have a map and we look: right now there’s a person in Hartford that wants to do our endurance package. Once we put the tour together, we contact the person and say, “Hey we’re coming to your city, are you still interested? If you’re not a coward you better still be interested cause we’re going to work you out. We’ll show you what time it is.”5. FM: Which cartoon characters appear on your cartoon-themed pillowcases? Max: Wet dream come true? (And to be honest I don’t have a lot of wet dreams ’cause like, I have a lot of privacy in my bunk, and I can make it happen whenever.) But I’d like a Thundercats pillowcase. D.A.: Dude, I’d say Mighty Mouse would be pretty dope. Yeah.  6. FM: Which African Safari animal most embodies Chester French?Max: The elephant. Hands down. No more stupid questions, dude. Just figure it out yourself. The elephant. Dumb fuck.  D.A.: The Cheetah too Max: D.A. don’t be ignorant D.A.: Whatever Max: I saw an elephant once in D.C., it was pretty disgusting. D.A.: Elephants have huge wangs. They’re really inspiring.  Max: Yeah. 7. FM: So you mention in the package description that you will play a game of two-on-two basketball with your clients—Max: Not our clients – that implies more of a business relationship. Endurance is really more of a spiritual and emotional thing. We’re trying to come up with a word – comrade and brother are sorta taken. We’re into neologism and we’re gonna invent a word to use. We might say “jacque jammer” . D.A.: Or even just a “jacque” Max: Even just a Cousteau.  D.A.: Yeah.8. FM: So who would win in a game of two-on-two: your producers Pharrell and Chad Hugo—Founders of Star Trak—or Chester French? D.A.: They’d win because Pharrell’s black, and everyone knows black people are way way way better at basketball. Max: And what people don’t realize about Pharrell is that in addition to having massive, powerful, yet soft and beautiful hands, he’s like 6’3”, dude. I saw this mother fucker like no joke, do a two hand reverse dunk with two running steps. I’m not even shitting you. I might be shitting myself right now, but I’m not shitting you. 9. FM: Who would win in a game of one-on-one: D.A. or Max? Max: One thing I learned, ’cause I used to play with a lot of retarded kids, is the best way to resolve any game is to play to a tie – that way everybody’s happy. Retard or not, down, whatever, people got feelings. So you gotta play to a tie. Unless there’s a black guy like  Pharrell, then he’s totally gonna smash you.  D.A.: Every time. 10. FM: By the way, you guys know this is running in FM, right?Max: Oh great, yeah yeah, FM has lower standards, you can print whatever the fuck you want. D.A.: You know a couple years ago I was writing a column for FM. Yeah, go check it out. It ran every week; it’s called the “Bell Lap.”  11. FM: What has been the greatest change in your life since becoming jet-setting rock stars? Max: I tried this product called “Extends.” I’ve been getting a lot of e-mails about it. It’s all-natural male enhancement. It’s been the greatest change...in my life. Shit is way bigger now. I’ve grown comfortable taking it out in most situations and retail environments, which before I was a little timid about.  D.A.: I don’t know, I mean we live on a bus now, which is a fairly extreme lifestyle switch. But other than that I mean, we live in our mom’s houses. In the cities we grew up in. We still don’t know how to cook very well. Yeah. Oh also, we now have millions of dollars. Just joking—we don’t.  Max: I’m in debt, actually.  12. FM: How has the response been to “Love the Future”?:  Max: Great—people bought it and told us it was good. D.A.: The Boston Globe gave it an amazing review, just like the Associated Press. People Magazine gave it 3.5/4 stars, and without any radio play we’re the number 3 top album on iTunes, and the number 12 album on iTunes this morning overall. So it’s been great. Just the past year—touring or whatever—we’ve got a lot of people who actually support us, who aren’t just following a trend. You always worry that people might not like it. We put out a pre-album a week ago, called “Jacques Jams Volume One: Endurance.” And that’s a free album. So now we tell people you can go and get a whole album  for free, and if you like it please buy the real one. I’ve never seen an artist do that before.  Max: You can give us $8, and you can get two albums. That’s literally 100 minutes of music.  13. FM: How is being a rock star like being a Harvard student?Max: It’s not like being a Harvard student at all.  D.A.: You’re not in college Max: You’re not in class, don’t go to dining hall. D.A.: You do hang out with a lot of rich people.  Max: A lot of arrogant rich pricks. Who are actually stupider than they think they are. A lot of people who only care about money too.  14. FM: You produced much of “Love the Future” while at Harvard. How large of a role did Star Trek play in producing the final product?Max: One thing that was really exciting and appealing was that from the first time we met them, they were happy to let us do whatever we want. That’s what they prefer, and what we prefer. We have sought their advice, and usually what happens [is] they don’t tell us what to do, just make us feel comfortable making our own decisions.  You know they’re like, “Make your own call, this is your album, get it done.” They’ve been enormously helpful, and super inspiring to us throughout our whole lives. And it’s been exciting getting to watch them in the studio and collaborate with them a few times. D.A.: Working out with these kids is 21st century alchemy. We’re living the miser’s dream right nowMAX: The miser’s wet dreamD.A.: Super wet. It’s like going everywhere. 15. FM: What can we expect next from you guys? D.A.: We’re coming to play in the Square in May third.D.A.: We’re gonna get naked and show everyone what we’re all about. Max: Show everyone what “Extends” is all about.

As we prepare to enter day four of spring reading period, you might have noticed that this year, with the cancellation of CEB Turf, all is quiet on the inter-house warfront.
For those of you who were too absorbed in studying for finals to notice that your more valiant Housemates were fighting in a war, Turf was the online, campus-wide Risk tournament that was staged by the CEB for the past two years.
According to a CEB e-mail, the tournament was cut primarily due to lowered participation.  There was also the issue of some Houses allowing a small group of people to control the armies of non-participating students.  (That’s fair—we at FlyBy definitely recall relinquishing our fas emails last year in bewildered apathy and then promptly forgetting about the entire thing.)  Plus, running Turf takes money and manpower to implement.  Basically, it sounds like the CEB just got a little battle-weary:
More after the jump.
But some students seemed to think that the CEB’s move to cancel Turf was...well, an invasion of their turf.
Fear not, disappointed Risk-takers—Turf might return at a later date.  Meanwhile, the CEB has decided it can do the greatest good for the greatest number by staging a party instead of a war.  So go drown your sorrows in alcohol this Saturday at the CEBlock Party, which will take place from 2-5 p.m. on the actual turf outside the MAC.  Onward!

Yale Freaks Out About Swine Flu
You would think that swine flu has gotten old by now, with Mexico finally letting people into the streets again and the United States easing up on precautions. But apparently Yale has gotten so worked up about swine flu that they've canceled both their summer course and internship program in Mexico, leaving 19 Bulldogs without summer plans. In this economy, good luck finding another internship in May...during finals.
More elite campus news, after the jump.
Stanford Students "Have Rice at Dinner"
A clever headline by The Stanford Daily News. Kind of. When former Stanford Provost Condoleezza Rice dined with students at Stanford, they said they had a positive experience speaking with her--though several students also protested outside on the lawn, arguing that she should be prosecuted for "war crimes" such as "authorizing torture and waging aggressive war in Iraq."
At least, however, these Cardinals were nicer than that 4th grader.
Budget cuts hit UChicago's "Social Sciences nad Humanities" the most
Besides the expert copy-editing at the Chicago Maroon, things aren't looking too good at UChicago.  Each of the three divisions have taken a 25% budget cut, which has hit the smaller humanities departments especially hard, since the sciences already enjoy substantial outside funding. Their Slavic department is dying, with at most one graduate student matriculating next year.  Ultimately the choice for the humanities division came down to hiring new faculty or accepting more graduate students--and they decided to focus on the former, reducing the size of their incoming graduate school class by 25-30%. At least that will mean they will graduate fewer unemployed Ph.D.s?
Do the humanities have value later in life?
Over a quarter (26%) of Daily Pennsylvanian readers say, "No."
