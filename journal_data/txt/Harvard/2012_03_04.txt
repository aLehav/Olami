After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend, freshman Amanda Sobhy leads the way for the Harvard women’s squash team in the CSA Individual Championships at Amherst, Mass. After helping the team clinch the Howe Cup last weekend, Sobhy claims the No. 1 seed in her quest to win the Ramsay Cup. Clearly, we have a phenom on our hands, but how good is she really? The numbers speak for themselves…
0 - The number of sets she has given up all season
1- The position she has played all season on the Crimson squad, and the seed she has going into the national championship
5 - The number of points she gave up to Yale’s Millie Tomlinson, the No. 2 seeded player, in the Howe Cup final
12- The number of matches she has won so far this year, as an undefeated player
15 - The greatest number of points she has given up in a single match
100 - The total number of points she has lost
396 - The total number of points she has won

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 15 Harvard men’s lacrosse team suffered its first loss of the season to No. 20 Hofstra in a defensive battle on Saturday afternoon at Soldiers Field Stadium.  Despite a hat trick from senior attackman Jeff Cohen, the low-scoring contest ended in a Crimson defeat, 7-6.
“[Hofstra] came out and played hard,” co-captain Terry White said. “We played really hard but didn’t match their intensity yesterday.”
Freshman attackman Keegan Michel won the opening faceoff for Harvard (2-1), but Hofstra (2-2) controlled the play early on, jumping out to a 3-0 lead.  The first Pride goal came 2:56 into the quarter, followed by a second less than five minutes later.
After Hofstra’s third unanswered goal, the Crimson finally responded. Harvard worked the ball up the field into offensive territory, where a pair of freshmen put Harvard on the scoreboard. Michel battled off two defensemen and sent the ball across the face of the goal to midfielder freshman Sean Mahon, who scored the first goal of his college career.
“It’s great to see our freshmen stepping up,” White said. “I think that goal will give [Mahon] confidence moving forward.”
Still, the Crimson trailed 3-1 as the first quarter ended.
The Pride won the faceoff beginning the second quarter and drove straight up the middle of the field.  It took just six seconds for the Pride to add to its lead and retake the three-goal edge.
Later, after a Hofstra shot and a save from junior goalkeeper Harry Krieger, the Crimson gained possession of the ball and carried it into its offensive half. Cohen notched his first goal of the game with a powerful shot to the upper left-hand corner of the goal to cut the deficit to two.
“Jeff finds ways to score clutch goals when we need them most,” junior defenseman Brad Cappellini said.  “His contributions often swing the momentum back in our favor.”
Two minutes later, Cohen found himself in front of the goal again and netted his second unassisted goal of the game, once again finding the net’s upper-left corner.
“[Cohen] has really stepped up,” Cappellini said.  “It is a true testament to his hard work as an individual and the dedication of the senior class as a whole.”
Minutes later, after a missed shot for Harvard, Hofstra recovered the ball and took it the length of the field. Hofstra junior Adrian Sorichetti found the back of the net to give the Pride a 5-3 advantage.
The Crimson won the following faceoff with 1:30 left to play in the half.  With a mere four seconds to play, Cohen completed a second-quarter hat trick. He took a pass from behind the cage from sophomore attackman Carl Zimmerman and fired a shot into the left side of the net, sending Harvard into the half down one.
Just under two minutes into the second half, sophomore midfielder Eric Slingerland picked up a ground ball and the Harvard attack soon capitalized.
Co-captain Kevin Vaughan tied the game on a dodge from behind the cage and slipped a shot past Pride senior goaltender Andrew Gvozden. With 12:46 to play in the quarter, the game was tied at five—the first time the Crimson had been level since early in the first quarter.
But Hofstra’s Ian Braddish soon responded to Vaughan’s goal, firing a shot past Krieger to put the Pride ahead, 6-5, with 8:31 left in the third quarter.
Hofstra carried that lead into the fourth quarter. With just under eight minutes to play in the game, Crimson junior defenseman Jason Gonos forced a turnover and picked up a ground ball.  Slingerland took a pass and drove up the middle of the field before firing a shot past Gvozden to tie the game at six.
Hofstra responded promptly. Less than a minute later, Ryan Reilly drove up the middle of the field and scored what proved to be the game-winning goal with 6:52 to play.
The Crimson’s best chance at an equalizer came with just under two minutes left in the game, as junior midfielder Ryan Stevens’ shot hit off the post.
Harvard picked up two penalties soon after and was unable to score a man-down goal as time ran out.
Harvard outshot its opponent, 31-25, and picked up 20 ground balls to Hofstra’s 18, but the Crimson never held the lead.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Jeremy Lin and the New York Knicks are traveling to Boston this weekend to take on the Celtics on Sunday at TD Garden.  Even if you are disheartened by losing the UC Ticket Raffle, here are some reasons why you should still make your way to the game:
1. JLin supported us, we should return the favor
Harvard men’s basketball took on Columbia in NYC on Friday night.  Lin, along with new pal Spike Lee, was spotted in the stands cheering on his former team.  Lin reportedly congratulated the Crimson in its locker room after the 77-70 overtime victory.  Return the love to the Knicks’ new star by supporting him at Sunday’s game.
2. Harvard students should experience an actual basketball arena
While the cramped quarters of Lavietes Pavillion certainly foster a lively atmosphere, the Crimson basketball arena is notorious for resembling a high school gym.  Why not venture into Boston and see our very own on the main stage?
3. Potential celebrity sightings
The recent advent of Linsanity has revived the scene at Madison Square Garden.  The new energy and excitement has attracted quite a crew to the Knicks’ courtside seats.  Celebrities ranging from Mark Zuckerberg to Seth Meyers to Jay-Z and Beyoncé have all been spotted at the Garden in recent weeks.  Who knows whom you might encounter on Sunday as the Knicks take on the Celtics.  Maybe even Drew Gilpin Faust will venture to the game.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following a missed Cornell layup, sophomore Christine Clark grabbed the board and pushed the ball up the floor. Seconds later, the ball was in the hands of co-captain Lindsay Louie who squared up and let the three fly. Nothing but net.
The basket wasn’t a buzzer-beater, nor did it even occur at a pivotal moment of play. But on senior night, that didn’t matter. The crowd reacted as if that shot had just won the Harvard women’s basketball team the game. In actuality, it was the first basket of the night.
With that in its back pocket, the Crimson (16-11, 9-4 Ivy) took control of the game and never looked back, topping Cornell (11-16, 5-8), 65-59, in a wire-to-wire win Saturday night at Lavietes Pavilion. This victory seals Harvard’s second-place finish in the Ivy League and earns the team a bid to play in the WNIT.
“It was a great team booster at the beginning of the game,” said co-captain Brogan Berry of Louie’s three. “It got everyone to stand up; it got everyone so hyped. It was just what we needed to start the game out.”
Fittingly, the game from start to finish was about the two seniors: Louie and Berry. Though Louie averages only 4.9 minutes per game this season while Berry is sixth all time in program history with 1,398 points, Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith spoke of both their importance to the team.
“I think they are two exceptional young women,” Delaney-Smith said. “They are both very different in their careers here, both very valuable to the program, both have given their hearts, souls, and tirelessly worked as captains for this team.”
Louie has not received as much playing time thanks in part to a series of injuries, according to Delaney-Smith, leaving Berry to be the leader on the floor.
“Brogan is probably one of the best point guards that has ever put on a uniform [for Harvard],” Delaney-Smith said. “She’s broken all kinds of records and created some very exciting history. She is the quarterback on the floor. It doesn’t matter whether she is the scoring [leader] or being the calm leader out there. No matter what her stats say, she is invaluable to us.”
And on Saturday night, Berry’s leadership lived up to the hype.
The Crimson was on top from start to finish, pushing the lead at one point to a game high of 13. That comfortable distance was short-lived, though, as the Big Red quickly fought back, cutting its deficit to only three with 5:38 remaining in the second period.
From there, though, it was all Harvard. Thanks to a layup from Clark and a three-pointer from junior Victoria Lippert, the lead was pushed back to eight.
And then Berry got the ball.
Catching it on the left wing, the point guard dribbled to her right and pulled up just in front of the charity stripe. The baby jumper was good, and the Crimson finished off the game with its second weekend victory.
“It was really good to come out with a win, especially on a Senior Night,” Louie said. “Our girls have been working really hard all season, and to see how much love and emotion everyone came out tonight was really great.”
Alongside the seniors, junior Emma Golen led the team with 15 points, including shooting four for seven from behind the arc.
“[Golen] is very unselfish, very humble,” Delaney-Smith said. “With her technique and her touch, if I could get her to have more of a scorer’s mentality, she could be one of the best to ever play here.”
Though the game began and ended with the seniors’ successes—the made-three point shot to start the game and the running jumper to cap off the winning run—Louie and Barry were quick to shift the emphasis back to their teammates.
“There was a lot riding on these games this weekend,” Louie explained. “To see the team come together and really pull for each other was amazing. Our saying for the weekend was, ‘What are you going to do for your teammates?’ And I think that was a really integral part of how we played as well as how our emotions played into the game.”
Brogan agreed with her co-captain, stressing the important role of the team’s camaraderie in its victories.
“I think we’re a team that plays off of each other very well,” Brogan concluded. “A few of the girls came up to me and said, ‘We’re playing for you tonight.’ That really makes you want to go out and do the best you can. It was amazing to see everyone working so hard for us this weekend. It could not have better.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
ITHACA, N.Y.—With a win Saturday night in Cornell’s Newman Arena, the Harvard men’s basketball team clinched at least a share of its second straight Ivy League title—just the second in program history.
But the 67-63 victory against the Big Red (12-16, 7-7 Ivy) didn’t come easy for the Crimson (26-4, 12-2).
“We’ve been a tough basketball team this weekend,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “Our toughness and our togetherness certainly allows us the opportunity to win on the road in this league.”
Cornell struggled from the field in the first half, scoring just 21 points on 32.1 percent shooting and a 14.3 percent mark from long range. But the Big Red came out of the locker room on a hot streak, outscoring the Crimson, 11-5, in the first five minutes of the second half, including a 6-0 initial run to close the six-point gap Harvard held at halftime after less than two minutes had elapsed.
The Big Red capitalized on Harvard’s mistakes, earning 15 points off of turnovers and 10 fast break points to Harvard’s 12 and 0 points, respectively.
But Harvard’s hot shooting proved to be too much for the Big Red. The Crimson went 21 of 43 from the field and 12 for 26 from three, netting an especially impressive 91.7 percent of second-half free throws after a dismal two-for-five effort from the line in the first.
BABY GOT BACKCOURT
Despite going zero for three from the field in the first half, junior point guard Brandyn Curry made four straight three-point attempts in the second frame—all within a span of four minutes—to keep Harvard in the game during a crucial Cornell hot streak.
Curry—who finished the night 4-of-5 from deep—single-handedly spurred the Crimson offense at the beginning of the second half, with junior forward Kyle Casey and rookie Steve Moundou-Missi contributing Harvard’s only other points on two free throws apiece in the first 9:56 of the second half.
It wasn’t until nearly 10 minutes had expired on the second half that Keith Wright netted Harvard’s first non-Curry points from the field.
Co-captain Oliver McNally followed took over later in the game, leading the team with 13 second-half points including two late three-pointers.
McNally—who netted a team-high 17 points on the night—once again found himself with the ball in his hands as his opponent resorted to a last-ditch fouling effort. The senior was able to capitalize, draining all four of his free throw attempts in the final 20 seconds, closing out a perfect, six-for-six night at the line.
Harvard relied heavily on its three-point prowess Saturday night, attempting 26 shots and earning a total of 36 points from deep. And the backcourt duo of Curry and McNally combined for 21 of those long-range points, as the Crimson shot an impressive 53.8 percent from three in the second half.
SENIORITIS
In the opening frame of a game played on Cornell’s senior night, it was freshman Dave LeMore who led the Big Red, scoring six points off the bench in the first half on the way to a perfect, four-for-four night from the field.
Harvard was able to hold Cornell’s two leading scorers—senior guards Drew Ferry and Chris Wroblewski—to just seven points total in the first half. Ferry—who currently sits 10th on the Ivy League scoring list with 11.5 points per game—shot just one for four in the half, while the Crimson held Wroblewski to an ice-cold, one for seven shooting effort.
But Wroblewski caught fire in the second half, shooting five for nine from the field and two for three from three, as the senior finished his final game in a Cornell uniform with 19 points and seven assists, good for a game high in both categories, while also contributing two steals for Cornell.
“What a career [Wroblewski] has had,” Amaker said. “And I told him that. He’s an outstanding player. He has some of the things we just talk about with our kids, toughness and heart. He put his team on his back and tried to will them to victory.”

As  part of our Housing Market series, we'll be posting  reviews and  rankings for each of Harvard's 12 residential Houses over  the next few  days. Click here to read more about the series.
Perhaps no Harvard House inspires as passionate, conflicting opinions as Mather does. While some lament its distance from the Yard, others note that Mather has its own shuttle stop, and argue that it's not nearly as far as the Quad Houses. Many complain about the concrete architecture and aesthetically unpleasing wall-to-wall carpeting, but on the flip side, Mather guarantees its residents singles for life. That being said, most Matherites put distance and beauty aside; for them, it's "Mather all the way baby."
House Spirit: Matherites are loud and proud about their House spirit, and in poll comments, over 50 percent of respondents named House spirit as Mather's strongest asset. The Stein Clubs are always well attended, and every year Mather welcomes a multitude of drenched freshmen with open arms to its "Mather Lather," a soapy, sud-filled party in the dining hall. Aside from HoCo organized events, Mather residents are also known for hosting crowded parties every weekend.
Housing Quality: Mather famously guarantees its residents singles for life in suite-style living. If you value privacy, Mather is the place for you. Or, as one resident put it, "Singles for life means you won't be single for life." The singles are quite spacious, and in the poll Mather was ranked fourth among the Houses in overall housing quality. Suites can include multiple floors and large common rooms, and there's generally a lot of socializing among residents of each floor. The problem of course is that Mather looks more like a concrete box than an old Harvard house. If you're looking for ivy-enlaced brick walls, Mather probably wouldn't be your first choice, but if you want to upgrade to a Queen size bed in your dorm room, Mather won't disappoint.
 
Dining Hall: Matherites are very proud of their dining hall, which features floor-to-ceiling glass windows that allow for nice, natural lighting and a terrific view of the Charles river. The dining hall is great if you prefer a more modern feel, and many Mather residents return there during the day for meals despite its distance from classes.
Facilities: The modern architecture certainly does not make for a homey vibe, but many Matherites don't seem to mind. After all, as one resident notes, "The outside isn't classically Harvard, but at least we look at Dunster instead of having to live in it. It's all about the view." Mather does have a variety of social spaces, and an underground tunnel system connects most areas of the House, saving Matherites from the blistering winter cold. Mather residents feeling the urge to exercise can take advantage of its cardio and weight rooms, while those who just want to hang out with friends can use the Mather pool, ping pong, or foosball tables.
 
Rating: Mather's distance from the Yard and concrete jungle exterior contributed to its overall ranking of ninth out of 12. The low ranking, however, will probably come as a surprise to the residents who claim, "Mather is probably the best thing that happened to Harvard."
Our rankings so far:
9. Mather
10. Winthrop
11. Cabot 
12. Dunster

Although the statistics vary, data shows that students will sit on a toilet for somewhere between six days and three weeks straight during their time at Harvard. These impressive numbers inspired an odyssey in search of Harvard bathrooms fit for a king. If you have time, take a pit stop at one of these locations, which sport some of Harvard restrooms' finest décor.
Bloomberg Hall
Architecturally impressive, this Business School building seems likely to espouse luxury. Indeed, upon entering this basement bathroom, you're greeted with a pattern-tiled floor and walls painted a soothing yellow—a sharp contrast to the whitewash of most university bathrooms. Also of note are the paneled mirror, faux onyx counter, and opaque hanging light fixtures. The only downside is that it's a trek across the river.
The Center for European Studies 
This old-world style building, located between the Science Center and William James Hall, feels like the kind of place that would offer luxurious bathroom amenities. Inside, the bathroom is a lovely room with navy blue wallpaper and matching tiles. However, disappointingly, there was no bidet to be seen. Bonus points for having to descend a winding staircase in order to reach it, though.
Littauer
Turning the brass knob to this side-hallway bathroom, you feel more like stepping into someone's office than going to the john. Inside, the stained wooden stall dividers and granite accents make it feel like the kind of bathroom that you have to make a reservation to use. If you ever find yourself in the Science Center when nature calls, take an extra minute to walk west to Littauer. You won't regret it.
Loeb Library
If you take the stairs to the lower level of Loeb Library, make a left, and then another left when you reach the door to the Le Corbusier Special Collections, you'll find a restroom adorned with photographs of bathrooms around the world. So as you sit on the loo, you can look at how others go about their business on continents other than our own.
Robinson Hall
Although much ground has been covered in this journey around the school, there are some toilets that remain inaccessible to members of the opposite sex. One example is the women's bathroom in Robinson Hall, located directly behind Sever. Hanna Retallack '12 boasts, "There's a cushioned chaise in the bathroom, which is super convenient."
Evidently, there are more undiscovered gems to be found in the world of Harvard restrooms. So keep searching, exploring, and discovering. Who knows? Maybe someday, someone will get to see whether Faust really does have a golden toilet seat.

Currier House, named after Radcliffe College alumna Audrey Bruce Currier '56, might be less quaint and historic than the brick buildings of the other two Quad Houses, but its four residence towers still aren't quite as ugly as Mather's. Architectural jokes aside, the House's tree-loving residents are more than happy to boast of their great housing and tight-knit community, and most admit they don't have much to complain about. The one thing holding the House back might be its location in the widely feared Quad, but residents insist that the distance is worth its other countless perks, as "the shuttle beats walking anyway." Perhaps one student's responses to poll questions describes Currierites' attitudes toward their House best: "What are the best things about living here?" we asked. "Everything. It's Currier," came an answer. And the worst? "Nothing. It's Currier."
House Spirit: Currier seems to have a lot of House spirit; student poll responses elicited an excess of capital characters and up to 22 exclamation points, and the House ranked third in this category overall. Students' enthusiasm for living in Currier is one of the most frequently cited benefits of the House, contributing to its positive and welcoming atmosphere. Currier's notorious "bikini brigade" and "speedo squad" always dominate in full force on Housing Day, an example of the House's "really awesome/geeky/cool spirit." Even more notable is students' "Currier-love," not only for their House, but also for each other. "Walking into Currier feels like home," one student wrote. "I can always find a group of friends to sit with in the dining hall." Overall, most Currier residents are convinced that they have it all: "There is no better group of people on campus," one student insisted. "We have everything you could ever want."
 
Housing Quality: Housing really doesn't get much better than Currier's. Students boast of their "singles for nearly everyone," although a larger-than-anticipated incoming sophomore class did force a few singles to become doubles this year. Students are housed in either Daniels, Gilbert, Bingham, or Tuchman, and most are granted generous square footage and large windows, and are often provided with in-room kitchens and private bathrooms. Currier's luxurious housing lends itself to "fabulous parties" nearly every weekend: "Have you seen the Ten-man?" one commentator asked. The ten-man and solaria suites are coveted rooms usually provided to seniors, provided with spacious singles, bars and kitchens, and almost excessively large common rooms. "My room…has a bathroom, a full kitchen, and a wrap-around balcony," one Currierite gushed. "Good stuff."
Other perks to housing include controllable heating within three of the residential towers, the "natural light," and the fact that all residents enter through one entryway and central hallway, meaning students in this already small House see each other and interact frequently. There is a "lack of an old-Harvard feel," one student confessed, but this is accompanied by a "lack of roaches." It is worth mention, however, that a few students did complain of "too much linoleum in some places," a questionable color scheme, and the maze-like organization of the House, making it difficult to navigate at times.
Dining Hall: Although Currier's dining hall can be "a little retirement homey in design," some students find the carpeting, plants, and skylight "cozy." What receives unanimous praise, however, is both the food and community: Along with what many call "the best food on campus," Currierites love their dining hall staff, who "always bring out stuff if you request it and will even let you know in advance if something they know you like is going to be on the menu." Unlike its neighbors, Pfoho and Cabot, which share a kitchen, Currier has its own, which many insist leads to better-quality food. This "fabulous" d-hall, which is usually pretty quiet, also offers "the best brain break" and a drinks station outside of the servery for around-the-clock access. Currier ranks in second place for their dining hall.
Facilities: The House's best-known facility is the Fishbowl, home to Halloween's infamous "Heaven and Hell" party each year. When not converted into a haven for overeager students in costume, the Fishbowl hosts Stein Clubs and movie nights and serves as an informal gathering spot for students. The House also has a ping pong and pool table, paired with a television and sofas, as well as tables and seating convenient for work. Other facilities include the Treehouse, a room hosting regular drawing lessons through the Office for the Arts, a dance studio, and both a weight room and gym with treadmills, ellipticals, and bikes. A side door to the House also offers the most convenient access and closest distance to the QRAC. For many students, all this results in their "never having to leave the building for anything," though some regret that Currier only has a "House reading room" but no official or traditional House library like others do.
The Rating: In the end, incoming students really have no reason to heed the House's motto, "Timete Arboreum," or "fear the tree" (except, of course, for the new disturbing Housing Day video...) Ultimately, the House has a lot to offer, but distance still stands in its way. Currier received an overall rating of eighth out of 12.
Our rankings so far:
8. Currier
9. Mather
10. Winthrop
11. Cabot
12. Dunster

For most Harvard students, YouTube exists as a state-of-the-art procrastination tool. However, if you scratch below the surface, you'll find that there's a lot more to YouTube than meets the eye.
Play Snake on YouTube:
This trick allows you to play Snake with a YouTube video playing as the background, taking YouTube's procrastination capabilities to a whole new level. It is, however, a little tricky to master. First, click twice (note: don't double click!) inside the video screen itself. This will pause and then play the video. Now hold the left arrow key down and then press the up arrow key. A flashing snake and a dot should appear in middle of the video! You might have to try it a couple of times to get it to work.
Link to a specific point in a YouTube video:
To begin playing a video from a specified time, rather than the beginning, add #t to the end of the URL, followed by an equal sign, the minute you want to start at and the letter "m," and then the seconds followed by the letter "s". (It should look like this if you want your video to start two minutes and thirty-four seconds in: #t=02m34s). Alternatively, while watching a video, simply pause the video at the desired point in time, right click on the screen itself and choose "copy video URL at current time".
Disco!
This feature is largely self-explanatory once you discover it. Surf over to youtube.com/disco, type in an artist's name, and YouTube will churn out a mountain of their music videos, played one after another—nice if you want your Pandora stream to be a little more visual.
Get the YouTube video to fill an entire browser window:
Replace the "/watch?v=" in a traditional YouTube URL with "/v/". This is great when you want a video to occupy only part of your screen real estate. You can simply resize the browser window to the desired size and position as you like.
Lean Back:
Check out youtube.com/leanback—great for when you've just gotten home from a long day of work. True to its name, this feature allows you to control YouTube exclusively with the keyboard, so you can sit back and discover all the quirks and curiosities the site has to offer in absolute relaxation.
The Youtube Billboard 100:
To discover what's popular, you can always click the "browse" button on the YouTube homepage, but youtube.com/charts offers a much more comprehensive guide to what the world is watching. You can rank videos by most viewed, most liked and top favorited, and over a wide range of timescales. Great for discovering new material, but be warned: popular doesn't always mean good.
Artistify!
Not "YouTube" per se, but in the aftermath of the Oscars, this is a great trick to know. Visit TheArtistifier.com to turn any YouTube video into a parody of Oscar-winning silent movie "The Artist". You'll have minutes of fun! If you want proof, check out this silent version of The Crimson's "15 Hottest Freshmen" video.
