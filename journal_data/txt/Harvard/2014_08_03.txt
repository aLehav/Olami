After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dear Bosswoman, Assistant Bosswoman, and Jim;
I am giving my two weeks notice.
In two weeks I will be moving out of the cubicle and I will be taking my name plate, which I made myself, using a folded piece of printer paper and a pen that I found in my desk from D’Amore McKim School of Business.
The rest of my possessions—an eight-ounce arrowhead water bottle that I keep in my desk drawer, a red felt tip marker that I use for editing, and the comic strip that I tore out of the Boston Globe and pinned to my cubicle in an attempt to lighten up the mood— I will leave to Jim.
Jim, I think that you will like the comic. It’s a sketch of a typical office, with a maze of cubicles and employees, where a single mouse that asks the human workers, “Have we found the cheese yet?” 
I hope that when you look at that mouse, you will think of me, and remember that moment that we shared at the printer, when we thought that it was broken, but I actually just hadn’t pressed the print button yet. That was funny too, was it not? 
And yes, Assistant Bosswoman, I know that you asked me to return the red marker when I was done editing that 57 page report written by the other interns, but I forgot. I just promised it to Jim and I think that it would be incredibly inconsiderate of me to offer him the pen, and then not actually give it to him, especially since this might be the last interaction that we ever have.
And on that note, I want you to know that this is nothing personal: it’s not you, it’s not me. It’s the system. 
(And please convey this sentiment to Bosswoman because I fear that she won’t have the time to read this letter.) 
All this time I’ve been just like the mouse in the comic, I’ve been searching for the cheese. The only thing is, there is no cheese. And by that I mean that there is no free cheese for the interns. Or more aptly, no free food whatsoever. There is only filtered tap water. 
And I’m trying to offset the costs of this unpaid internship because it’s starting to add up. I’m spending $15 a day on coffee, half of which is decaf, because I am weaning myself off; another four dollars a week on seltzer water, because our water has no bubbles; And $4.20 a day on public transportation.
And I can’t walk. Sure, it’s only a three-mile commute, and I’m in decent shape, but the city is just not safe enough to traverse on foot. I tried once, and I got attacked by a goose. 
And I shouldn’t have to get attacked by waterfowl after a long half-day of sitting in a cubicle and editing out Oxford Commas with my red pen. I have too much self-respect for that. 
I think that I deserve to be paid. I’m trying to offset my costs with free food, but it’s not easy. There is only water, and occasionally, mints. 
And it’s hard to drink eight dollars worth of water an hour. My bladder is only so big, and the bathroom is pretty far away from my desk (88 paces, I counted). And the candy dish, which I pass on the way to the bathroom, has not been restocked for weeks. So I have little incentive to want to leave my cubicle. 
And this candy dish! This is my biggest complaint. Putting an empty bowl on a table in the kitchen is inhuman, especially as some of us interns are relying on those Brach’s Cool Blue Mints to get us through the work day.
But even if it were full, the candy dish wouldn’t be enough. A five pound bag sells for about $20. That’s about 375 pieces. I would have to eat 150 mints an hour for it to equate to minimum wage. And I’m not sure that I want my breath to be that minty.
This is also just assuming that I’m only worth the bare minimum. Which I also don’t think is true. I think 12 dollars an hour is more fitting. That’s 75 more mints, plus benefits— which I’m not sure how to quantify, but I’m sure, that with all of this processed sugar and cubicle sitting, I’m going to need a good medical plan and gym membership.
So no. The mint plan will not work. I must leave. And I’m giving you guys two weeks, or one, depending on when this article is published. A fortnight from the 24th, I will fill my water bottle for the last time, take the aforementioned objects from my cubicle, and pray to God that the geese haven’t figured out how to navigate the bowels of Boston’s public transportation.
In the meantime, I hope that this letter does not change the office dynamic. And that in the event that I apply for another (paid) position in a related field, one of you will be willing to write a stellar letter of recommendation on that official letterhead stationery.
Also, I wouldn’t mind object to some sort of going away celebration in the conference room — maybe we can get cake?
Sincerely, 
Nicole J. Levin

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Mayor Michael Bloomberg's speech at Harvard's Commencement this past May was perplexing. On one hand, his main philosophical point–that academic freedom and resistance to censorship are valuable and just principles–is one which anyone should find convincing. Moreover, his focus on recent controversies over rescinded invitations to would-be commencement speakers highlighted a number of cases where universities have been poor stewards of academic freedom. 
 On the other hand, the Mayor's at-times conspiratorial preoccupation with the existence of a growing liberal regime of censorship seemed at odds with the rest of his speech. After noting that "96 percent of all campaign contributions from Ivy League Faculty and employees went to Barack Obama," and arguing that this statistic implied an overly homogenous intellectual environment, Mayor Bloomberg later named three political phenomena that were evidence of closed-mindedness:  the Federal ban on funding gun control research, the prevalence of climate-change denial and creationism, and the Federal government's cuts to the research and development budget. Given which side of the political spectrum sustains much of this anti-intellectualism, perhaps the Mayor should have been more shocked by the four percent of campaign contributions that did not go to the President's reelection campaign, rather than the 96 percent that did. 
 More than this incongruity, however, the Mayor's speech suffered from the oversimplified historical analogies which he cited. At one point, Mayor Bloomberg rightly mentioned the cases of Socrates, Galileo, Nelson Mandela, Vaclac Havel, Ai Wei Wei, Pussy Riot,  and "the kids who made the 'Happy' video in Iran" as exemplars of the type of censorship that society should eliminate. And throughout his address, the Mayor referred to liberal censorship at universities as "a modern-day form of McCarthyism." But making such a blanket comparison between his historical examples and the apparent censorship the Mayor observes today ignores what made the former particularly pernicious, and inherently different from modern day graduation-speaker controversies: state sponsorship.
 Strikingly, most of the Mayor's evidence for modern-day liberal censorship on college campuses comes from private institutions, like Smith, Swarthmore, and Johns Hopkins; and even when it comes from state institutions like Rutgers, the censoring impulse emanated not from the state-appointed governing board, but from elements of the faculty and student body. His historical examples, however, all have to do with state censorship of political views. Socrates, Galileo, Mandela, Havel -- all were persecuted by state institutions and accused of breaking laws. The Red Scare also relied on the complicity of private institutions such as the entertainment industry, but with its legally-prescribed loyalty oaths and roving Senate subcommittee hearings, the government played a central role. 
 Drawing a line between state-sponsored censorship and censorship from other sources may seem like making a distinction without a difference, but consider the intensity of graduation speaker controversies today and the Red Scare, or Galileo's persecution in the 17th century. In the latter two cases, official sanction led to ruined lives and imprisonment. When modern universities cave to protesters and awkwardly rescind commencement invitations, they draw condemnation, risk losing donors, and generally appear spineless. The speakers themselves are hardly silenced in any comprehensive way, and might gain some publicity. In short, the worst censorship has historically come when the state and large segments of civil society combine to eradicate certain viewpoints. When colleges act this way in a country with a well-functioning civil society, they are reneging on their responsibilities as bastions of free inquiry, but they are hardly becoming harbingers of a new McCarthyism.
 And before we conclude that graduation speaker controversies are always antithetical to free speech, we should note that commencements are a special case of academic freedom. Another element of the Red Scare that was so pernicious was its use of what professors did and believed out of the classroom as a condition of their employment, thereby infringing on their freedom of speech and association and detracting from their core purpose: teaching. But when colleges award honorary degrees, controversy is inevitable because those degrees confer legitimacy on the actions of public figures. And sometimes protests against degree recipients may turn out to be right.
 Harvard's choice of the Shah of Iran as commencement speaker in 1968 is one such instance. Given that the Shah came to power in a U.S.-sponsored coup against an elected government and had a questionable human rights record, Harvard would undoubtedly like a do-over on that choice. But the powers-that-be overruled student protestors, and one of recent history's more infamous figures can claim the honor of an honorary degree from Harvard. 
 None of these criticisms should detract from the validity of Mayor Bloomberg's central point: censorship for the sake of silencing opposing views is inherently unjust. But that apparent absolute comes with caveats. Not all censorship is evidence of systematic persecution, and some public addresses carry weightier moral implications than others. Colleges should be firm once they pick commencement speakers, but they should also ensure that their choices do not affirm intolerance and oppression, the very evils which academic freedom exists to combat.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For me, the word “pogrom” evokes black and white images of Cossacks attacking Jews living in the shtetl, scenes from movies like “Fiddler on the Roof,” back in the times of olde when Jews were unequal before the law.
Well, pogroms have happened in France several times throughout the past couple of weeks, so maybe they’re not as antiquated as I thought.
Though some might feel that it’s extreme to use the word “pogrom,” in this case, I truly do not believe that I am exaggerating. Short of including actual murder, the recent anti-Semitic demonstrations in France have been reminiscent of pre-World War II Eastern Europe.
On Bastille Day, a group of anti-Israel protesters besieged a Paris synagogue filled with congregants while waving the flags of terrorist groups like Hamas, brandishing replicas of Qassam rockets that are being launched into Israel, and screaming phrases such as “Death to the Jews” and “Hitler was right.” On Sunday, despite the French government’s ban on protests instituted out of fear of another pogrom, a group of anti-Israel demonstrators marched through the streets screaming, “Death to Israel,” burned a kosher grocery store and a Jewish-owned pharmacy, and attempted to destroy some synagogues. The violence seems to be never ending, with news of new attacks every few days.
These pogroms are fueled by the escalating tensions over the situation in the Middle East, but French Jewry has been in a precarious state for over a decade. Ridiculous amounts of anti-Semitic violence have been inflicted upon the community for years: in 2006, a Jewish man was kidnapped, tortured for three weeks, and left for dead, and in 2012, three children and a teacher were killed in a shooting at a Jewish school. Though these are extreme examples of contemporary French anti-Semitism, they characterize the experience of Jews living in France as one marked by a justified fear of terrible violence.
I am a Jew in America. I have no blood relatives in France. But these pogroms are personal.
These pogroms are personal because I am the granddaughter of Holocaust survivors. My grandmother survived Auschwitz and my grandfather survived a labor camp, but few of their family members survived with them. My grandparents created a new life in America, putting the horrors they endured behind them in order to focus on a brighter future. To see echoes of 1930s Hitler-era Europe in modern-day France, Germany, and Turkey is terrifying. My grandparents did not survive the Holocaust for another one to kill their grandchildren. I will not idly behold these portents of genocide.
These pogroms are personal because I feel a connection to every Jew. When Abraham Geiger, a leading Reform Jewish figure in the 1840s, was approached about a blood libel in Damascus, he famously responded that he was more concerned with his fellow German Jews’ ability to obtain pharmacy licenses. I do not share this particularistic approach to Jewish community. On the contrary, I am equally concerned about American Jewish issues and foreign Jewish issues. My French brothers and sisters were threatened in these pogroms, and I consider that a personal threat.
These pogroms are personal because I feel a connection to every human being. I cannot even begin to imagine the suffering, both physical and emotional, that European Jewry must be going through. No group of people deserves to be treated in the way that wannabe terrorists in France are acting towards that nation’s Jews. No group of people deserves to be targeted for violence simply because of who they are.
These pogroms are personal because they were triggered by Israel’s campaign against Hamas. Though I am a proud American, I consider Israel to be my true homeland, and those who align themselves against Israel align themselves against me. Even more so, I am spending the summer in Jerusalem–Hamas is trying to kill me. These protesters in France are Hamas’s friends. So, yes, it’s personal.
These pogroms are personal to me, but they should be unacceptable to every human being. It is imperative to raise awareness of what’s happening in France and Israel, and to vehemently oppose the senseless violence. Shtika k’hoda’ah–silence is like praise–the rabbis of old said. Their wisdom is just as relevant today. We must speak up now, to show that we do not stand with the terrorists of Europe and Gaza, to show that we will not stand for violence against the innocent.
