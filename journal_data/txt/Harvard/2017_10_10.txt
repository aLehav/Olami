The failure of “All-American Girl”—a sitcom revolving around an Asian American family—in 1994 raised the stakes for the survival of “Fresh Off the Boat,” both as a faithful representation of the Asian American experience and as a watchable sitcom. “Fresh Off the Boat,” however, just aired its fourth season premiere, proving that it continues to stand its ground as a generic sitcom, while still highlighting issues that have often been neglected by mainstream television. That said, the sitcom appears to have exhausted the “relatable Asian family” moments that made it so successful in the past (i.e. using the dishwasher solely for storage) and now relies on the same lazy humor and cliché lines that support other unspectacular sitcoms.
The season premiere opens with the premise that the Huang family is trying to move back into their old house after briefly living in a larger, fancier one to help get their youngest son a spot in a local prestigious prep school. They move in with Jessica’s friend Honey, but run into conflicts almost immediately. To show the extent to which the families are unable to share the space, Honey’s teenage daughter, who needs the bathroom, yells, “Mr. Huang’s been using the blowdryer for four hours! You’re a man! You always look the same!” All the show’s jokes are similarly unnatural and unclever. Louis tells his son that he used to dream of starting his own construction company. He pauses as if to say, “I’m about to deliver a joke … Just you wait…” and says, “I had a name picked out and everything: ‘Huang Construction.’” The other jokes in the show are similarly stale.
Along with unoriginal jokes, the show is also filled with unoriginal lines. Conflicts are ungracefully packed in, presented in a way that couldn’t be more obtuse. They are solved with lines that have most likely been featured, verbatim, in countless other works, like “The hardest thing about figuring out who you are is letting go of who you used to be,” and, when talking about the nature of family, “You know they’ll always have your back, no matter how hard things get.”
The show also tries to engage with modern issues. Honey’s teenage daughter comes out to Eddie Huang, the oldest son, as a lesbian, and Eddie barrages her with affectionately uninformed questions, such as, “When do you turn gay?” Honey and Jessica navigate their cultural differences after Jessica overstays her welcome and accidentally takes advantage of Honey’s Southern hospitality. “We’re very nice liars. You’re supposed to know that. It’s an unspoken understanding,” says Honey. “Where I come from, it’s an unspoken understanding  that you don’t say thank you to your family because you don’t need to,” Jessica clarifies. The two then make up.
It’s refreshing to see the Huangs’ Asian American cultural customs on the television screen, even if they are not front and center. And while a lot of the show is objectively very silly and corny and cliché, it’s still very heartwarming. "Fresh Off the Boat" is a good place to leave problems behind after a long day, as any sitcom should be.

Packed to the brim with action, “Watch Me” of “Scandal” lives up to the show’s reputation as a serious political drama. With the seventh and final season now underway, it’s readily apparent that creator Shonda Rhimes is pulling out all the stops for her famed Thursday evening show. However, with Olivia Pope in a position of power and a limited number of episodes left, it will be a challenge to keep storylines dynamic with potentially static characters.
Make no bones about it: “Scandal” is still Olivia Pope’s show, and this final season exhibits the heroine at her most powerful. Our first glimpse of the character is one of unquestioned authority: Clad in white heels with hair swaying lightly in the wind, she radiates professionalism in the highest degree. Putting a wayward congressman into place, she presses, “Before, you asked ‘In what world?’ I’m answering: Mine.” With the supporting cast either heeding her orders or falling into step over time, there’s no arguing that Olivia has a stranglehold over this new administration.
And yet, though she’s stunningly composed, and though Kerry Washington knocks the role out of the park, there’s still something unrealistic about her station. Olivia’s greatest flaw is that she’s perfect—perpetually equipped with a steely gaze and a tight-lipped, three-point argument and rebuttal, the protagonist so overshadows her political counterparts that it’s almost boring.
It follows that the show’s brightest moments are when Olivia is challenged. Moments of small rebellion—a news reporter cutting her off, for example, or Mellie (the president of the United States) reminding her who owns the office—are welcome checks and balances on Olivia’s near-tyrannical position. In one foreboding scene, the leading woman speaks with her father at a restaurant about her newfound authority. Between sips of ’91 Bordeaux, he cautions her about the danger of being on top. And while Olivia rejects his warnings, one cannot help but wonder if, as he says, her day of reckoning is coming.
If such a twist is planned, the episode doesn’t show it. Despite featuring romantic frustration, political jockeying, and an overseas crisis, the premiere avoids leaving Olivia in any hot water. The show opens itself to multiple possible conflicts—Olivia against Cyrus, Olivia against the president, and even Olivia against the interests of her own consulting firm—but allows none of them to flourish. Instead, the master maneuverer overcomes all of her opponents effortlessly, a feat which would have been impressive had she not already been in total control. Season premieres are expected to put characters into play and set plotlines into motion, but the loose ends and plot possibilities get tied up pretty cleanly by the end of “Watch Me.”
The show, by virtue of being a political drama, has short forays into social commentary. At one point, the vice president monologues about the education system, and Olivia herself gives an impassioned speech about women in politics. Interesting as they are, these scenes have their impact diluted by the high-stakes drama unfolding around them.
The seventh season of “Scandal” shows a great deal of promise. Given the series’ past success, there’s sure to be plenty of drama between characters who are more titan than human. That said, the best dramas stem from individuals who have room to grow, change, and learn about themselves. The biggest challenge “Scandal” writers have this season is figuring out how to introduce complexity and struggle to characters who have already reached their peaks.

UPDATED: October 11, 2017 at 4:04 a.m.
The energy in the Agassiz Theater was electric this weekend as the cast and crew of the comedy “Next Customer Please” prepared for their upcoming opening night. The original play, written by alumnus Boyd I. R. Hampton ’16 and directed by Carla E. Troconis ’19, follows a group of eccentric coworkers in retail struggling with wild customers and corporate decisions.
The rehearsal process was explorative and playful, with a lot of laughter. “I’m really excited for people to see comedic plays back on this campus,” said Troconis. On casting the comedy, a genre of theater often very exclusive to white, male, and experienced actors, she said, “It was really important to me to bring new people and people of color into comedy—and women.” Approximately half the cast, which mixes newer and more experienced actors, are people of color.
The theater has been transformed to reflect the cool, corporate design of a retail store. Costume Designer 
Audrey H. Effenberger ’19 said, “Those IKEA shelves, they’re the real stars of the show.” She is especially excited for the audience to see how the crew has experimented with staging and set, as the Agassiz theater has transformed from its old, regal self into the comically mundane environment of a retail store. “We’re using the space in front of the stage as another level of the store,” she said.
The cast of “Next Customer Please” was lively and optimistic going into tech week. Actor Rocket R. Claman ’21, who will play Rosie, gave credit to the director. “Carla is a phenomenal director, I really look up to her. It makes me really happy to be here,” she said. Her character Rosie gets into trouble when she can’t stop talking. Nikki M. Daurio ’19 plays Sandra, an ultra-positive character who considers the store her happy place. Daurio was excited to portray a character who is energetic, but also has two sons to keep her anchored.
Both actors agreed that they hope the show acts as a remedy for the stress both of midterm season and of recent current events. “I want it to be levity for the student body—go to the theater and laugh with your friends,” Daurio said.
Claman added, “I think people will leave the show happy.”
“Next Customer Please” opens October 12 at Agassiz Theater and runs until October 15.

While the event was scheduled to start promptly at 7:00 p.m., by 7:30 there was still no sign of Art Garfunkel, one half of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame folk duo Simon and Garfunkel, currently on tour to promote his new memoir “What Is It All but Luminous: Notes from an Underground Man.” Low murmuring reverberated throughout the packed First Parish Church, with college students and old fans alike anxiously awaiting the artist’s arrival.
When Garfunkel arrived, followed by moderator and WGBH’s executive arts editor Jared Bowen, the room erupted in a standing ovation that lasted until they both sat down. Bowen seemed surprised at the warmness of the welcome. Garfunkel did not.
Garfunkel began by explaining the process by which he composed his novel. “As I walked, I wrote. I wrote about my life, my marriage, and about Paul Simon.” The walks that he referred to were a series of staggered treks he made in the ’80s and ’90s, covering in installments the countries of Japan, Ireland, and the United States.
During these walks, Garfunkel had ample time to reflect,write, and listen to music—not excluding the tunes of his disbanded folk duo. Listening to his songs with fresh ears gave the artist new perspectives on his work, including his duo’s five-time Grammy award-winning hit. “The finale of ‘Bridge Over Troubled Water’ went on for too damn long,” Garfunkel said, referring to their fifth album’s final song.
Garfunkel, a notorious perfectionist, even went so far as to criticize his performance at “The Concert in Central Park,” an event that drew half a million people, became the band’s first live album, and is the seventh largest concert in American history. “I wasn’t pleased. The audience loved it, but [the performance] is not really for the audience. When you’re up there, you’re busy in your own hard work. I’d give myself a C+,” he said.
In talking about Garfunkel’s work in Simon and Garfunkel, the conversation inevitably turned to Garfunkel’s intermittent relationship with his lifelong friend Paul Simon. When Bowen inquired into the relationship between the two artists, Garfunkel became defensive and vague. “Why don’t I ask you about your marriage, Jared? Winter follows summer no matter how beautiful the summer is. Relationships wax and wane. For two-thirds of a century, his arm has been around my shoulder,” he said.
Bowen attempted to continue the conversation, but the artist seemed keen on changing topics. “I’m interested in moving on. I want to be seen as a man with twelve solo albums,” he said. Later in the conversation, Garfunkel reflected on the nature of transition in one’s life. “I don’t think we make conscious decisions to end chapters of our lives. It’s only later that Jared asks us to title events in our lives,” he said.
During the Q&A portion of the event, an audience member asked Garfunkel if music could be used to address the political crises of today, just as the music of Simon and Garfunkel did in the 1960s. “I want to represent the things we’re forgetting, the beauty of a melodic line. I can’t believe the times we’re living in: a distortion of truth and beauty. It’s unacceptable that we should consider all of this normal,” he said.
While Garfunkel had no qualms commenting on the state of society and politics, he responded more cautiously when asked about his views on the state of modern music. “It’s so easy to give a one word answer: no! But you never know if you’re making a judgement because of your blindness. It’s a tough age to be,” he said.
One audience member, Julian F. Gonzalez ’21, prefaced his question by explaining to Garfunkel his family’s personal connection to the artist’s music. Gonzalez expanded on his story after the event. “When my dad first came to this country, he took lessons at a local community college to brush up on his English, and there he met my mom who was his tutor. They went out on a few dates and they kinda liked each other, but it wasn’t until one night when they were out and the song ‘Bridge Over Troubled Water’ came on and they started slow dancing did they realize this is who they were meant to be with,” he said.
Self-described Simon and Garfunkel enthusiast Carolyn G. Martin seemed very pleased with Garfunkel’s light demeanor. “I was surprised how approachable he was. The very first thing I thought after the event ended was, where is this man going to get a drink after this. I want to go and have a drink with him and continue these conversations.” Martin was also impressed with the way Garfunkel confronted tough and personal questions. “Going into this, I was thinking is he going to have a lot of ego, how is he going to portray Paul? But I think he handled that dynamic really well. He was pretty objective for someone so mired in that relationship. It was a night to remember: pretty good for a Wednesday,” she said.
Audience member and writer Harold Lepidus, author of “Friends and Other Strangers: Bob Dylan Examined” echoed Martin’s sentiments. “I thought he was engaging. I thought he was very articulate as well as being self deprecating, because he has a reputation of being quite serious and he was actually very funny,” he said.
After Garfunkel answered a score of questions ranging from inquires into his walks, favorite artists, creative process, and drug-related endeavours, the event drew to a close. The breadth of topics discussed in the talk meant that the event served, much like his recently released novel, as a reflection on the life and work of Art Garfunkel. It seems fitting then that the prolific and celebrated artist ended the night on a reflective note. “I’ve just loved entertaining you. All my life. Thank you,” he said.

Meredith Lauren “Max” Hodges ’03 currently serves as the Executive Director of the Boston Ballet, the first professional repertory ballet company in New England. Right after earning an Anthropology degree from Harvard, Hodges worked for Bain & Company. Instead of continuing on in the consulting firm, Hodges took the skills she acquired from Bain and applied them to her passion for the arts. The Harvard Crimson sat down with Hodges to discuss her time at Harvard and how her experiences as an undergraduate influenced her career.
The Harvard Crimson: What was your involvement in the arts like at Harvard?
Meredith Lauren “Max” Hodges: The biggest influence for me was that I was the director of CityStep …I loved spending hours and hours in service of CityStep's mission, using dance as a tool to inspire Cambridge public school kids. That was meaningful to me deeply because it was arts-based. But I also just sort of discovered that I liked to run stuff. And so that had a really big influence on some career decisions that I made later on.
THC: While an undergraduate student at Harvard, did you foresee yourself being involved with the arts in some capacity?
MLH: I think that career paths make much more sense when you're looking back at them in your rear-view mirror … I'm sure a few times I said to myself  “'I wish I could just run CityStep as my job!” But it would have been among a thousand other things that I said to myself and among a thousand other interests. I definitely didn't have that certainty when I was in school.
THC: What experiences at Harvard have significantly impacted your life and career?
MLH: It's a place of high expectations and incredibly brilliant peers. And that just encourages you to raise your game in a way that other environments may not do. I would say that's something that I've looked to replicate in my career.
THC: Going from a consulting firm like Bain & Company and ending up as Executive Director of the Boston Ballet is kind of an unexpected career trajectory. How and why did you make that transition?
MLH: It's been really important for me to actually go out and try [different careers] and see. So, for me, that was leaving Bain and taking a job in the finance department in the Museum of Modern Art. … After a number of years at MoMA, I was in business school and I was thinking that maybe film would be interesting. I spent a summer working for an amazing independent film production company, but it wasn't a match for me. It wasn't. And then I spent some time in the summer working for the executive director of the public theater Shakespeare in the Park. And I said, “Oh yeah, I want his job. That's the match for me.”
But if you don't use these opportunities, whether it's a summer internship or a special project or just changing jobs, to kind of test some of these ideas, they wind up staying just that—just ideas.
THC: I know you have a new program—“Obsidian Tear” —opening in November. Can you speak a little bit about that?
MLH: We have co-commissioned a new ballet with The Royal Ballet in London … Another trend that's happening in the arts world, and certainly in the ballet world, is collaboration between companies all over the world. This is the first time that The Royal and Boston Ballet have partnered in this way. There is an artist named Wayne McGregor, a choreographer that both companies are very interested in. We came together to commission a new ballet by him…
It's really exciting to make new art. You know there's risk in it, more risk than other kinds. And, I think in this case, I can say that we are very, very pleased with how this work has come out. It's a really brilliant work for nine dancers—nine men. And it is a more modern piece. So more abstract. There is not necessarily a storyline, although I think that it sort of suggests some narrative qualities as you're watching. You can kind of put a story onto it, and the story you put onto it may not be the same as the person sitting next to you.

The everyday gets a makeover in “Fresh Complaint,” but not the kind it expected.  In his new collection of short stories, Jeffrey Eugenides, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of “Middlesex” and “The Virgin Suicides,” takes the banal, routine lives of a cast of restless, deeply flawed characters and throws them completely out of equilibrium.
In a collection of stories written between 1988 and 2017, Eugenides’s standout pieces are his most recent, the stories “Complainers,” which opens the book, and “Fresh Complaints,” which closes it. “Complainers” is an evocative exploration of the persisting friendship between two women, one middle-aged, and one elderly and addled by dementia, who bond over their mutual dissatisfaction with the lack of intimacy in their lives and their shared love of reading. The other, “Fresh Complaint,” follows a teenage girl desperate to escape the expectations of her conservative Indian family at any and all cost—even if it means destroying someone else’s life along the way. It is in these stories that Eugenides’s narrative talents shine, switching from character to character effortlessly, speaking from diverse perspectives with eloquence and accuracy. In these stories, his female protagonists are strong and multifaceted, more than victims, playthings, or furniture for the larger plot.
Unfortunately, not every story is as nuanced in its take on gender roles. Women in the pieces “Timeshare,” “Early Music,” and “Great Experiment,” do little more than serve as nuisances, housewives, or both, for the plot-driving male protagonists. A common theme throughout the book seems to be the changing role of women in the home, and yet the book speaks on female empowerment more through a lens of nostalgia for the past than praise for progress. Some of this can be explained by the characters through whom the stories are told, mostly male, old-fashioned, and married, but, even in this context, it feels a bit out of place. Three of the stories describe predatory relationships between an older man and a younger woman and with the exception of the aforementioned “Fresh Complaint,” the women involved are lazily fleshed out, existing solely as objects of desire to be used sexually and emotionally used by fragile, insecure male, and in one case female, characters.
Consistent throughout each and every story in the collection is the beauty and versatility of Eugenides’s style of writing. He flits easily between humor, reflection, anxiety, and lust: He conveys whichever emotion he needs to with graceful diction and an eye for detail. One haunting example is in the story “Air Mail,” in which a young college student, Mitchell, comes down with dysentery on an island off of Thailand and fasts with the intention to heal himself and, later, to propel himself towards a state of total enlightenment. Eugenides writes of Mitchell’s epiphany, “He could make out wavelengths of the moonlight. He’d managed to slow his mind down enough to perceive that. The moonlight would speed up a second, growing brighter, then it would slow down, becoming dim. It pulsed.” His fluid sentences flow into one another like tributaries, carrying each plot to its twisting conclusion.
At its best, the collection soars in its striking twists on the mundane—for example, a family man’s spiral into debt over his desire to own a clavichord—compelling the reader with elements of absurdity that do not fail to entertain. There are places, however, in which the author’s experimentation strays from the unique into the uncomfortable, and where a few of his stories fall prey to the dated, cookie-cutter confines of the suburbia they inhabit, most likely due in large part to the change in context between the time he wrote them and now. When Jeffrey Eugenides hits his stride, his deft narration and poetic detail coalesce into moments of pure magic, and it is for these moments that “Fresh Complaint” is worth the read.

A boat is there if you still believe in the ocean,
and a country remains if you lie still enough

to believe it. On the docks of Dandong,
a grandmother holds a bag of dumplings swimming

in soy sauce, fish moving blind through a
midnight current. She offers them to you,

insists, and you cup them within the pool
of your warm fingers. When the boat arrives

in New York, you unload yourself like
a misshapen syllable, tumble unheard through

the turnstiles and ferries, a wheel rolling over
its own mind. The first night is lonely,

a single breeze beckoning, a whisper from
the moon which looms so garish in its socket.

Years pass, and you forget about the boat.
Your children grow older, and your tongue

becomes a raft. Native words, spoken only
at night, a moon if you still believe they’ll

reflect something. If you still believe the space
waving within you.

It would be kind to say that Ridley Scott’s “Blade Runner” was released to mixed reviews back in 1982. The film was not only a critical flop, with people complaining about its slow pace and thin plot, but also a box office misfire. Although over the decades the cyberpunk thriller has achieved the status of a cult classic, it is still odd to think that 35 years later, we would be getting a $150 million R-rated sequel to a film that people didn’t even like. Yet here we are. “Blade Runner 2049” has arrived, and it’s amazing in every way.
Picking up 30 years after the original, “2049” follows LAPD Officer K (Ryan Gosling), a blade runner whose job is to kill bioengineered androids made to resemble humans, referred to as replicants. As he follows a mysterious case that could determine the fate of the world, he is eventually led to Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), the protagonist of the first film.
“2049” does exactly what a sequel should do. While it is very clear that director Denis Villeneuve is a massive fan of the original, “2049” tells a very different type of story while still keeping the DNA of the first film. Whereas “Blade Runner” was a sci-fi drama thriller, “2049” takes the form of a detective tale. Villeneuve doesn’t simply rehash what Ridley Scott perfected in the first one. Instead, he adopts a different visual style, expands the world, and takes deeper explorations of both old and new themes. The result is a film that is not a carbon copy of the original.
Unlike Scott’s film, which was primarily about the human nature of replicants and less so about Deckard, “2049” is first and foremost a character-driven film about K and Deckard. Both blade runners are given deep characterizations, allowing audiences to be emotionally connected to the film, and it is through their eyes that they discover the film’s thematic depth. Villeneuve revisits the theme of humanity, but also explores it on another level by introducing the theme of identity. Do we create our own identities, or are they given to us? Can we ever break free from our identities? These powerful ideas serve to make the film incredibly human, but in a different way than the first one was.
One of the best things about “2049” is its scope—it takes place throughout the larger “Blade Runner” universe rather than just in the first one’s dystopian Los Angeles. The rainy, crowded, blue and neon Californian city is still present, but it’s accompanied by the post-apocalyptic orange of Las Vegas and the chilly white of San Diego, among other locations. At times, however, it feels like Villeneuve visits so many magnificent new locations that one wishes he gave more time to the cyberpunk Los Angeles that was so memorable from the first film.
Still, Villeneuve’s direction is bold and thoughtful, and his confidence in his vision is made clear by the film’s length—“2049” is a nearly three-hour-long epic that takes its time to tell its story, but it doesn’t feel unnecessarily long. Rather, it is incredibly dense but never overcrowded, as Villeneuve gives the audience plenty of time to breathe and process everything that is presented to them. Villeneuve also understands that “2049” needs to be one cohesive film rather than a film merely setting up a future franchise. “2049” does a lot to build the “Blade Runner” world, but it still tells one complete story that properly concludes, while hinting at potential future stories to come.
Even more impressive than Villeneuve’s assured direction is the cinematography by the legendary Roger Deakins. Deakins creates a unique and immersive atmosphere with both grandeur and intimacy—long and steady wide shots of beautiful landscapes allow the audience to soak in the richness of the world, while close-ups of various details such as fallen statues and buzzing bees create a sense of presence. Every shot looks like a masterfully crafted painting, with perfect lighting, potent colors, and exquisite framing. It will be no surprise if the 13-time Oscar nominee finally wins the award for his work on “2049,” although he doesn’t need it to prove his mastery.
All the cast members give excellent performances. However, the real standouts here are Harrison Ford and Sylvia Hoeks. Ford delivers some of his best work yet with an incredibly emotional performance, while Hoeks, playing one of the film’s villains, is suitably chilly and terrifying, as if she could unhinge herself at any moment.
Composers Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch also deliver a surprisingly satisfying score. These composers understand the genius and significance of Vangelis’ revolutionary score from the original, but also that this new story requires different music. The music from the film is very consistent with the style of the first film’s while still feeling fresh. It is instantly recognizable as something from the “Blade Runner” universe, despite consisting almost entirely of new themes.
“Blade Runner 2049” is an ambitious, beautiful, and powerful film. It is hard to think that anything could even compare to the original “Blade Runner,” yet Villeneuve and team have pulled off this impossible task. “2049” is an arthouse film as much as it is a blockbuster. As such, it offers something for everybody. Go out to the theater and see this on the biggest screen possible. Hollywood doesn’t make blockbusters like this anymore, and it is uncertain how long we will need to wait till another “2049.”

British alternative musical duo Aquilo kicked off their North American tour in Cambridge at the Sinclair on Oct. 3. The band’s two members, Ben Fletcher and Tom Higham, are known for their ambient, dream-like sound, teeming with piercing vocals and sleek production. Bringing their talent to the States, Aquilo gave a memorable performance at the Sinclair, playing seven songs from their newest album “Silhouette.”
The band opened with “I Could Fight on a Wall,” a song emblematic of Aquilo’s velvety sound. Pianist and vocalist Ben Fletcher was giddy with emotion, exclaiming how excited they were to start their North American journey in Cambridge. Quite shy at first, the duo got more comfortable with the audience as the show went on and began to banter. Their energy and passion became palpable in both their banter and body language.
Later into the show, Ben spoke about the inspiration behind their album track “Better Off Without You”: “This song is about Tom’s ex-girlfriend. She was nice, but not to Tom.” Every time they stopped playing the music and started talking to the audience, they spoke with an unshakeable sense of sincerity.
While the music was melodious and whimsically disarming, many of the songs seemed to bleed into one another. The band alternated between soft triumph and lonely despair, making it hard to differentiate one song from the next. There were some distinct songs that broke the monotony, such as “Complication,” which drew inspiration from funk. The duo’s tendency to play loops from previous songs while transitioning to their next particularly didn’t help them break away from this auditory uniformity.
That is not to say, however, that the show was not enjoyable. The duo has immense talent and a great sound. With their sensual vocals and haunting ambience, Aquilo lulled the audience into a state of quiet introspection. However, this lulling teetered on the edge of lullaby and would have been better had it been complemented with a more varied or better-structured set list.
Aquilo’s opener, Yoke Lore, was an excellent taste of what was to come. A musical duo from New York, Yoke Lore played some high energy synthpop to pump up the crowd. Accompanying their layered sound with banjo acoustics, Yoke Lore achieved a unique sound that set the tone for the rest of the night.
As is typical for the Sinclair, a venue with a stylish warehouse vibe, a mix of concrete and classic red brick flooring, and a tall ceiling, the show’s production was superb. Outside of one or two instances when percussion instruments obscured the vocals, the sound was phenomenally crisp. The colored dynamic lighting was also a welcome addition to the show. Often bathed in a soft red or blue light, the duo were complemented by the constant dynamic interplay of shadows and light, working seamlessly with their eerie sound.
Aquilo ended the night with the title song of their newest album: “Silhouette.” Much like the song, the concert began quietly, with both the audience and artist unsure of which direction the show was going. However, once the duo became comfortable with the audience, every song gained a certain gravity. Each word and melody became part of a symphonic sound as they allowed their music to build gradually and dissipate naturally. A bit of a slow burn, Aquilo’s show may have left spectators who left early disappointed, but, for those who stayed for the whole show, it was a treat.

Notes echoed words, and words echoed notes. The building blocks of sonic and narrative stories riffed, forming a cadence of their own.
These notes and words, presented by the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra Chamber Players, interwove fluidly during a performance of Igor Stravinsky’s “L’Histoire du Soldat” in Paine Hall last Friday. Written in 1918 as World War I tore across Europe, Stravinsky’s piece unfolds a Russian folktale about a soldier who loses his violin to the devil, embarks on a quest to save a sick princess, and ultimately pays the price for trading the joy of music for wealth. The subject matter is rooted in fantasy, yet C.F. Ramuz’s repetitive libretto coupled with Stravinsky’s darker, dissonant music seems more representative of the piece’s real-world, historical context.
For the Chamber Players’ rendition, conductor Elias Miller ’16 recruited music professor Thomas Forrest Kelly as the narrator. Kelly in turn asked music professor Anne C. Shreffler to read the soldier’s lines and University organmaster and choirmaster Edward E. Jones to play both the devil and a mysterious old woman who also appears in the story. “Stravinsky says you have to have three people,” Jones said. Incorporating costume touches such as Shreffler’s red cap with gold filigree and Jones’s red capelet—actually a tiny Superman cape belonging to his son—the professors kept the storytelling light and entertaining.
“Marche du Soldat” (The Soldier’s March) anchored the soldier’s journey in rhythm and plot. The theme appeared three times in the piece—as the opening to Part I, right before the conclusion of Part I, and again as the opening to Part II. “Down a hot and dusty road / tramps a soldier with his load,” Kelly intoned, his voice gravelly with the weight of the soldier’s journey. On the heels of this narration, trumpet (played by Andrew Heath, the brass instructor at the Dedham School of Music) and trombone (played by Topher W. Colby ’20) kept the soldier’s pace and at times aggrandized the march to a triumphal one. The violin (played by NaYoung Yang ’18) and percussion (played by Kai Trepka ’20) undercut the soldier’s walking music with the edgy melodies of an anxiety-riddled homecoming.
After the soldier traded his violin for the devil’s book of secrets about attaining untold wealth, the soldier realized the bargain took more than the three days the devil had promised. “It wasn’t three days, I’ve lost three years,” Shreffler read, accentuating the frustrating and destabilizing passage of time. In the ensuing “Pastorale,” the clarinet (played by Erica L. Chang ’19) underlined the loss with soft, wistful notes. Words and notes worked in tandem here as an emotive, layered form of storytelling.
Throughout the program, the professors’ adapted libretto enhanced the music and the narrative with Harvard-specific references to engage the audience on a contemporary level. Bartering with the devil, for example, the soldier asks what kind of food the devil will share with him. “Mr. Bartley’s every meal,” Jones replied, smiling that his devil was familiar with Harvard Square establishments.  Sheffler also made reference to a Harvard t-shirt carried in the soldier’s pack, and when it came time for the soldier to save the king’s sick daughter, narrator Kelly described the monarch’s desire for a Longwood-trained physician. “What they want is a Harvard M.D.,” Kelly said.
To make this long story short, music and narrative combined with humor from the present for an enjoyable and relaxing evening of sound and storytelling.

Chuck Berry’s “Johnny B. Goode” blasted from a pair of speakers as models strutted down the catwalk in colorful, eye-catching attire for Boston’s SoWa Art and Design District’s 2nd Annual Fashion Show. Spectators flanked the makeshift runway, a roped-off red-brick ramp along the boutiques and art galleries of Thayer Street. Lit only by the afternoon sun, the kickoff to Boston Fashion Week featured fall-themed ensembles from the District’s own designers and vintage market in a lively show to the public.
The eco-friendly, women-owned boutique Ash & Rose dominated the show, featuring pieces in vibrant hues and patterns. The shop sources their clothing and accessories from fair labor producers with resource-conscious manufacturing processes. Their collection is made from organic and recycled materials, and shipped using minimal packaging. Beyond the sustainability, the artisan-made dresses were the true highlight of the Ash & Rose lineup, with bright colors and patterns that drew attention to the wearer without being too overstated. One model sported a particularly stunning navy and white patterned dress, complimented by a brown leather vest sourced from Ethiopia. The manufacturer of this vest employs at-risk women in Ethiopia, a common theme among the producers from whom Ash & Rose imports their stock.
Not to be outdone were the ensembles from SoWa’s Vintage Market and Bobby from Boston. The market is a curated indoor collection of vintage fashion, jewelry, furnishings, and other goods from a variety of rotating vendors. One market look turned an oversized black blazer, accented with golden flowers, into a one piece, pairing it with a barely-visible black minidress and noir stiletto booties.  SoWa’s most impressive contribution was their collection of vintage dresses, seemingly plucked straight from films of the early 20th century. One model danced down the runway in a mid-calf, drop-waist flapper dress, hemmed with white feathers, while another spun in a ’70s-esque red leather number, complete with a deep V-neck and pendant necklace. The SoWa market’s pieces took the greatest risks, and were duly rewarded with gasps of awe and applause.
Bobby from Boston, a vintage outfitter known for costuming movies and television shows, decked out the show’s male models in handsome suits, ties, and even one eccentric, golf-inspired look (think lots of plaid). In a professional meets casual look, the South End design warehouse coupled one of their signature t-shirts with an emerald, mid-length pencil skirt and matching blazer.
The fashion show offered a dazzling glimpse into the variety of styles available throughout SoWa’s Thayer Street shops and boutiques, a haven for thrift-shoppers and designer junkies alike. Best of all, the catwalk was just an introduction to SoWa’s Open Market, which also showcased outdoor artisan farmer’s markets, complementing the art and design district’s existing shopping and gallery spaces.

It was three in the morning when I opened Facebook to a peppering of headlines about the Las Vegas shooting. I was appalled at what I read—58 innocent people dead and hundreds injured—but I wasn’t surprised.
The tragedy that occurred in Las Vegas is not an isolated incident: Pulse, San Bernardino, Charleston, Sandy Hook, Virginia Tech, Columbine—the list goes on and on. The fact of the matter is that mass shootings are fairly common in the United States: Indeed, one happens nine out of every 10 days.
My heart goes out to all the victims of this ugly attack on humanity. And my heart goes out to the families and friends affected by this incident because loved ones are now forced to grieve deaths that were preventable. For despite some rhetoric, mass shootings are highly preventable and steps should be taken to reduce their likelihood.
First, we need to stop excusing mass shooters by classifying their acts as anything other than terrorism. The Nevada statute states that terrorism is “any act that involves the use or attempted use of sabotage, coercion or violence which is intended to cause great bodily harm or death to the general population.” While this shooting fits all the criteria of the legal definition, it is challenging to find the Vegas attack called terrorism in the media.
Some may argue that the federal definition of terrorism, which requires political or social motivation to classify something as a terrorist attack, does not apply to the Las Vegas shooting. But this argument loses its credibility when we remember that the federal definition has not been universally applied throughout even recent history. Dylan Roof, the Charleston Church shooter, is not deemed a terrorist, even though he was clearly motivated by racism. Meanwhile, Omar Mateen, the Pulse Nightclub shooter who was motivated by an allegiance to ISIS and a hatred for the BGLTQ+ community, is deemed a terrorist.
This short list of examples already reveals how our application of the term ‘terrorism’ depends largely on the race and religion of the attacker. As a society, we readily jump to define brown people, particularly Muslims, as terrorists, while we immediately “diagnose” white shooters as mentally ill, even though the vast majority of us aren’t doctors. By doing so, we not only otherize minority populations, but we place the issue of mass gun violence on something we can’t fix: a person’s demographics rather than a legal system that makes guns dangerously attainable.
Stephen Paddock is a terrorist. He is as much a terrorist as Omar Mateen, who is as much a terrorist as Dylan Roof. Terrorism does not have a skin color. Terrorism does not have a religion. Terrorism does not have a geographical region. Terrorism does not have a mentally ill status. Terrorism is terrorism, period.
After 9/11, massive measures were taken to decrease potential terrorist attacks in the future. Since doing so, we have not witnessed a second foreign terrorist attack of that level. With these protective measures, however, we have also produced the disgusting stereotype that Muslim is synonymous with terrorist. This is largely a result of the fact that we have not addressed domestic terrorist attacks with the same fervor with which we attacked 9/11. Attacking Islam is easy because Muslims are a minority. Attacking whiteness is challenging because white terrorism and supremacy has existed since before the birth of this nation.
The KKK, for example, continued the disenfranchisement of black Americans after emancipation by using  textbook terrorist tactics, employing “violence and threats to intimidate or coerce [people], especially for political purposes.” The current climate around terrorism in the United States cannot be understood without seeing the legacy of erasing white terrorism that predates the founding of the United States.
In the interest of our political goals, we continue to define terrorism as an issue that must be combated abroad. We seem to believe that if we focus our governmental and international energies on ISIS, we will destroy terrorism. But the situation is not that simple because terrorism is not just committed by those abroad. Terrorism is rooted in American history and survives on the scapegoating of minorities, while white terrorists are thought of as an exception to terrorism. If we accurately and sweepingly applied the term ‘terrorism’ to all the catastrophic shootings and attacks that have left tens of civilians dead, we could focus our energy on the real problem: gun control.
Gun ownership is codified in the Second Amendment, but that does not mean that procuring firearms should be easy. Nobody needs to purchase 33 guns in a single year, as the Las Vegas shooter did. By enforcing more extensive background checks and closing gun possession loopholes, the United States could be much safer. It’s ludicrous to think there is no correlation between the ease of procuring guns and the 12,000 gun-related homicides each year.
Stephen Paddock may have been a grandpa. He may have been retired. But he is also a terrorist, and will forever live in my mind as one regardless of what the media and the government want to call him. I will continue to hope for improved gun control, but I won’t be surprised if that doesn’t happen. And I won’t be surprised when more shootings occur and brown shooters, particularly Muslims, are called terrorists, while white shooters are called nothing more than mentally ill.

Following the new faculty motion to reverse College sanctions on unrecognized single-gender social organizations introduced by Computer Science professor and former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68, several recognized student organizations have announced plans to lobby professors to support the Lewis motion. These groups, including the Harvard Republican Club, plan to reach out to professors individually to explain why they believe sanctioning unrecognized social clubs is a violation of the freedom of association.
We fully believe in the right of students to lobby their faculty members on issues related to campus life. We have often opined on the need to incorporate student perspectives into major decisions affecting College life, and we continue to support students who communicate their concerns with professors.
However, while we fundamentally accept that groups such as the Harvard Republican Club have a right to engage in these conversations, this is an odd issue for them to fixate on. Sanctions on unrecognized social organizations are a deeply divisive topic on campus, and it seems unusual that groups not directly affected by these sanctions would ask their membership to actively lobby against them. It seems more rational to have students reach out to professors individually if they have a personal stake in the status of unrecognized social groups. Recognized student organizations have no such stake, and thus may not be the most effective or logical advocates on the subject.
Any time that a student organization decides to adopt a clear stance on a controversial issue, it is essential that the vast majority of its membership wholeheartedly supports that decision. We would hope that these student groups took the time to ensure that all their members’ voices were heard before deciding to use their organizational clout to influence professors. However, it is difficult for us to interpret the process that went into these organizations’ decisions, given that they have primarily chosen to keep their names undisclosed.
Indeed, we question why five of the six student groups claiming to lobby against these sanctions have declined to have their names released. Given that these groups feel so strongly about this cause, it seems hypocritical to then refuse to publicly tie their names to the stance they are taking. We welcome productive, respectful campus debate on the sanctions policy, but by remaining nameless, these organizations are hindering that conversation.
As these primarily unnamed organizations begin to lobby faculty members, we hope that professors are able to listen fairly to the plethora of student voices on the new sanctions policy. It will shape the experiences of all Harvard undergraduates, and an appropriate decision must weigh each student’s interests equally, rather than defaulting to the loudest voices in the room.

The iconic 1973 tennis match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs came to modern cinema a few weeks ago, with Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris’s “Battle of the Sexes.” While King’s victory and Riggs’s chauvinism make it easy for the movie to brand itself as feminist, there’s one moment regarding this matter that sticks out. Riggs asks King if she’s a feminist, and she replies, “No, I’m a woman who happens to play tennis.” Strange how there’s a need to differentiate between the two.
While it’s unclear whether or not King actually said anything along those lines, that little sentence calls into question the extent to which  we view athletes differently in light of their personal and political views. Sports culture is chock-full of homophobia and sexism, from the words athletes shout at each other on the field to the way the teams themselves are covered. Especially in today’s political climate, it’s therefore impossible to pretend your favorite athlete doesn’t have an opinion on anything you have an opinion on. Your favorite athlete attends Pride parades or has a ‘Make America Great Again’ hat in his locker. Your favorite athlete has domestic violence charges or rape accusations. But are you ignoring that? Are you separating the athlete and the individual?
Separating the art from the artist has long been a debate amongst critics. It’s much harder to do with sports, because unlike with a sculpture or a novel, being a sports fan means following your favorite athlete all the time. But even when watching an athlete do amazing things with their body, we aren’t thinking about the mind behind the actions—at least, not in a way that goes beyond their athletic prowess.
I don’t think that’s fair to them. It dehumanizes them, turns them into cardboard instead of people. It might be easy to fake when we just watch them on TV, but that’s not the case any longer. We follow athletes live-tweeting their favorite TV shows. We watch them taking trips to the zoo on Snapchat and going out for dinner on Instagram. And we’re always trying to get to know them off the field. That’s why every sports team makes its players do Q&As and meet and greets and all access videos. So how can we follow so many aspects of their lives and simply refuse to take their politics—or their actions and mistakes off the field—into account?
Athletes, just like artists, are shaped by where they come from and how they think. Their causes are defined by the causes of their communities. When they raise money for hurricane relief, it speaks to their character as athletes and human beings. As sports fans we are very fond of discussing “character,” as if that’s something we can glean from the two hours a week we see of someone huffing and puffing their way around a field. And yet we’re selective with what factors into our understanding of an athlete’s character. Their philanthropy, not their protests. Their charity, not their choices. If Colin Kaepernick’s political beliefs will follow him forever and change the way we see him, why won’t Tom Brady’s?
If the thought of a truly all-inclusive definition of “character” makes us uncomfortable, we need to stop throwing the word around. If you don’t want to think about an athlete’s offensive comments in tandem with their game, then don’t try to convince those around you that said athlete is a “good person.” If you don’t want to think about how an athlete votes or interacts with their community, in a consistent pattern of behavior, don’t try to bill them as an upstanding citizen—just celebrate their athleticism and nothing else.
But if we as fans want to speak to the natures of our favorite athletes, it’s time we stopped cherry-picking. We can’t ask for a tell-all and then put our hands over our ears.

Students and political leaders descended on Boston Common Saturday afternoon to voice frustration with the current political system and demonstrate their commitment to youth activism through Boston’s Youth Action March.
The event, organized by Harvard undergraduate Zachary D. Steigerwald Schnall ’21, began with speeches from close to a dozen politicians and student activists from around the Boston area, followed by a march around the perimeter of the Common.
Although the march’s Facebook page stated that the event was open to those of all “political leanings,” speakers derided many aspects of President Donald Trump’s agenda. Rally-goers wielded signs bearing slogans such as “defend DACA,” referencing a program to protect undocumented youth that Trump announced last month he would end, “public education is the backbone of the nation,” and “Black Lives Matter.”
“Your bodies are under attack.  Your rights are under attack,” Boston city councilman and mayoral candidate Tito Jackson told the crowd.  “It is absolutely critical that men step up and stand up for the rights of women and their right to choose what they do with their bodies.”
Most speakers, however, spoke about local issues that have a more direct impact in ordinary residents’ lives, calling on young people to play a role in politics.
“We have an opportunity in the city of Boston to do things a little bit different.  We should be fully funding our Boston public schools,” Jackson said to loud applause.
Similar marches, dubbed “Youth Action Marches,” took place in six other cities around the country as well, reflecting a surge in activism in the wake of Trump’s election.  The marches grew out of a youth march organized by Schnall and Bostonian Matthew T. Summers in April.
“We ran the first march as kind of a test run to see if the concept had potential. And we thought based on the attendees’ reactions to it and the passion that they had when they were at the first march that it really did,” said Schnall. “So starting in about mid-July we began outreach to other cities as well."
Organizers and speakers urged young people to get involved with the political process and make sure their voices are heard.
“We are at a crossroads in terms of the society we are going to be and [the] opportunities there will be for people to thrive here in the Commonwealth,” Setti Warren, mayor of Newton and 2018 gubernatorial candidate, told The Crimson prior to the event.  “This is a moment where youth activism is...critical and will decide what direction we go in.”
Sarah Shamoon ’21, who helped organize the numerous marches around the country and spoke at the Boston march said she “stumbled into this work by accident, but just kind of fell in love with public policy engagement.”
“Youth really are the change,” Shamoon said. “We are not the future. We are the present.”

The Cambridge Historical Commission unanimously recommended that Cambridge designate the Harvard Square kiosk as a historical landmark Thursday, a move that may grant the newsstand some protection in the city’s upcoming renovation of the surrounding plaza.
Landmarking the kiosk building could help maintain its architecture as the City of Cambridge plans a $4.6 million revamp of the plaza. Under the Historical Commission's proposal, any renovation in that would affect the structure’s appearance would require a “certificate of appropriateness” from the commission. The recommendation will likely go before City Council for approval this month.
The commission’s recommendation dates the kiosk—home to Out of Town News—to its use as a newsstand starting in 1984, though the commission could revise its proposal to mark the kiosk’s 1928 origins as a subway headhouse. 
Discussion over changes to the plaza and kiosk began formally in early 2016, when the City Council announced plans to “undertake the full restoration of the Kiosk building and plaza,” according to 2016 city documents.
Plans were mired in debate from the start over what renovations should look like and who would have a say in the process. Many locals raised concerns about a 2012 mock-up that reimagined the kiosk and plaza as a tourist center replete with LED screens and stadium seating.
In August 2016, five Harvard professors and one lecturer penned a Crimson editorial urging the preservation of the kiosk structure so that “future generations of Harvard students, Cantabrigians, and visitors can experience its iconic and historic form.” And the Harvard Square Neighborhood Association, formed by local residents last year in response to concerns about the changing face of the Square, has been active in discussing the future of the plaza.
Suzanne P. Blier, professor of History of Art and Architecture and African and African American Studies and a member of the HSNA, said the kiosk redesign project is key to the future of the Square.
“This is a multimillion dollar project that involves the kiosk and the plaza—it’s more than just a renovation,” Blier said at the October 1 HSNA community meeting.
Cambridge has formed a Harvard Square Kiosk and Plaza Working Group to navigate discussions and plans moving forward. Cambridge City Engineer Kathy Watkins and Stuart Dash, director of community planning, were both present at the HSNA meeting to present the city’s plans.
“I think the working group is a really good group with a lot of variety of folks on it, so it’s been a really good opportunity to really kick this off from the city’s perspective.” Watkins said.
Dash said input from Cantabrigians will be key moving forward. The city has hired the nonprofit planning firm Project for Public Spaces to help brainstorm the future of the plaza, and is working to hire an architect that will be able to best address concerns, according to Watkins and Dash. The city has also created a website to encourage locals to submit ideas.
“Our feeling is that everybody’s got some terrific ideas and the ideas can range from the smallest little aspects of the kiosk and plaza to the most boldest and largest-scale ideas,” Dash said.

Colorful costumes, honking horns, and sizzling street food greeted pedestrians in Harvard Square Sunday as part of this year’s Harvard Square Oktoberfest celebration.
The 39th such celebration, this year’s festival also featured 27 “Honk!” bands, groups of costumed musicians playing genres from samba to punk to hip-hop. According to the group’s website, the “activist bands” feature an “irresistible spectacle of creative movement and sonic self-expression directed at making the world a better place.”
One such group, the Rude Mechanical Orchestra, took to a temporary stage in front of the Harvard Square T stop clad in green. They sported signs and instruments emblazoned with slogans like “Black Lives Matter” and “End White Supremacy.”
While the "Honk!" bands played, various vendors sold refreshments and merchandise as part of the fair.
Denise A. Jillson, Executive Director of the Harvard Square Business Association, has been involved in planning for Oktoberfest for 11 years.
“I love the bands, love the music, love the parade, love all of the vendors and the different artisans that are here,” Jillson said. “It’s a great community day that brings in communities from around the region together to celebrate everything that’s good about life.”
Kari Kuelzer, the manager of Grendel's Den Restaurant & Bar on Winthrop St., agreed.
“My favorite part of Oktoberfest is probably the impromptu Honk performances all over the place, sort of as the festival wears down,” Kuelzer said. “They’re coming from all over the place, so the diversity and worldliness of them is really exciting to see.”
Kuelzer’s restaurant offered German-themed food and drinks, served by staff in Bavarian attire. Kuelzer said Oktoberfest started as a small street fair with beer gardens.
“It got a little bit drinky at some point, so they took the beer out of the festival,” she said. “After about two decades of it being just a sausage and knick-knack fair, they [Harvard Square Business Association] brought the beer gardens back in.”
Around the same time, the Honkfest joined the festivities.
“[This] has been a big change to the fair, because now we do it during the same weekend as the Honkfest, which is city-wide, and they come through and do a parade through Harvard Square, and Oktoberfest is sort of the capstone to their weekend event,” Kuelzer said.
Over the years, many new vendors have participated in Oktoberfest.
Esmeralda Lambert, who owns Church St. jewelry shop Esmeralda Jewelry, Accessories & Gifts, has been a vendor at Oktoberfest for three years.
“The type of customer that comes here to Oktoberfest is somebody that cares where things are coming from. They care about supporting small businesses,” Lambert said. “We love it here—the type of clientele.”
Jillson said those interested in future Oktoberfests should “try everything.”
“They should walk from one end of the Square to the other, because around every corner there’ll be something unique and different and fun and fabulous so that’s really the thing to do.”

For Mai-Linh Ton ’19, Freshman Family Weekend was the “single most devastating experience” of her first year at Harvard. While her friends and their families partook in the weekend festivities, Ton said she struggled to explain why her parents weren’t there—her mother worked six days a week, and her father had passed away when she was nine.
Drawing on her experiences, Ton—a Kirkland House representative and an active Crimson editor—presented legislation proposing an event for students whose family cannot attend Freshman Family Weekend to the Undergraduate Council, which ultimately passed the act.
Ton said she wished an administrator had reached out and invited her to a dinner with fellow students whose families couldn’t make it. This year, such an event will take place in Kirkland House for up to 75 attendees, supported by $3,500 of UC funding.
Ton said she hopes Faculty will also attend and speak to students interested in their departments.
At the UC’s Sunday general meeting, UC Vice President Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18 asked Ton whether the event could be altered in order to allow more students to attend.
“I think this is a really lovely event. I think it’s a great idea,” he said. “I wonder if you’ve thought about the notion of expanding this to not be a meal, but making it hors d'oeuvres, so you can have 200 people come.”
Ton said that she wanted the event to be a formal dinner, where students can foster relationships with faculty members.
“To have a quality event, we need to have it in this format, where it’s a sit-down dinner,” Ton said. “Instead of having a massive number of people, but not have a great take-away value, I’d rather try to come up with more funding.”
Ton said she is trying to secure support from the Freshman Dean's Office in order to allow more freshmen to attend the dinner.
“I’m working with the FDO to get more funding, so that would get more spots. It’s first-come, first-serve,” she said. “We’re hoping to get more capacity, because it would be really bad to say, ‘Hey, sorry your parents can’t come, but you can't come to dinner, either.’”
The event will be publicized mainly through entryway proctors, according to Ton. However, she said she hopes to find other avenues for advertising the dinner.
“We’re pubbing this through proctors, because they know students the best,” Ton said. “We’re trying to get some pubbing through FDO and possibly door-drops.”
At the end of the meeting, Ton said she hopes this event will bring awareness to the fact that Freshman Family Weekend experience differs for each student.
“I hope that this is one of many ways that we as a Council can help our constituents and continue to find ways to speak with them,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The College Events Board will not fund a campus-wide “Haunted Hall” Halloween party this year, returning the tradition to its status as a freshman-only social gathering.
The CEB and the First-Year Social Committee had collaborated to organize a free Halloween party in Annenberg Hall open to all undergraduates since 2015.
Jackson M. Grigsby ’20, co-president of the College Events Board, wrote in an emailed statement that the student-led programming committee is moving in a “new direction.”
“This year the board has elected to host a ‘Halloweekend’—a weekend of events centered around the holiday,” Grigsby wrote. “We do not believe it would be wise to host a school-wide dance in direct competition with dances hosted by other smaller student organizations.”
The First-Year Social Committee will spend roughly $12,000 on their freshman only Halloween party, according to Marie Keil ’14, fellow for first-year programs. In previous years, the College-wide social gathering cost around three times as much, Keil said.
Gemma Collins ’18, Eliot House Committee co-chair, said that while the CEB’s decision won’t affect Eliot HoCo’s activities too much, the lack of a social event open to all College students strains activities planned by other groups on campus.
“It does put added financial pressure on the House Committees in general, though, to be offering parties or other social options that weekend,” Collins said. “At this current time, when the College is trying to focus more on re-centering social life back in the Houses and in College-recognized social spaces, it is a shame that there is not a Halloween event open to the whole College,” she added.
The Halloween party debuted two years ago as College administrators sought to curb the influence of off-campus social organizations. In 2015, University President Drew G. Faust allocated money to Haunted Hall and another free campus-wide party, dubbed the “[BLANK] Party.”
Though Haunted Hall did not receive the same funding in 2016, Faust and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana later intensified their efforts to intervene in undergraduate social life. Since that time, Harvard has implemented sanctions penalizing members of unrecognized single-gender social organizations, and a faculty committee has proposed banning the clubs altogether, among other options.
Faust will review the committee’s recommendations and choose a course of action, though the policy could be subject to further Faculty review if it is included in the student handbook.
Meanwhile, attempting to recenter student life to the dorms, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences continues to push ahead with its more than $1 billion project to renovate the upperclassmen Houses.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences will need to approve any “major changes" to Harvard’s social group policy, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith said in an interview last week, complicating University President Drew G. Faust’s ability to make a “final” decision about the future of undergraduate social life.
Smith’s comments come as Faust prepares to choose one of three options for the future of undergraduate social life: maintain a current set of penalties for membership in the groups, ban membership in unrecognized single-gender groups, or consider other alternatives. Those options were set out in the final report from a committee tasked with reviewing Harvard’s social group policy; the committee’s preliminary report asserted that “The President will make the final decision.”
But Smith said in an interview Friday that proposed changes to the Student Handbook would go before the Faculty Council—FAS’s highest governing body—twice and then to the Faculty meeting for a vote.
“If we’re going to have major changes because of what comes out of the discussion, decision-making around unrecognized single-gender social organizations, I’m sure they will involve the same process,” he said.
Under the current policy—which is not in the College handbook—students in the class of 2021 and beyond can not simultaneously be a member of an single-gender final club or Greek organization and hold club leadership positions or athletic team captaincies, or be recommended for certain postgraduate fellowships.
The committee, convened in January, set out to revise that policy after many professors argued that they had not been properly consulted in its formulation. Now that the committee has made its final recommendations, Smith has passed along that report to Faust, who will choose which option to implement, although she has not said when she will do so.
But Smith said that if if the Faculty oppose that decision enough to vote down its inclusion in the College handbook, there will need to be more discussion about the policy.
“The best outcome for us is to have the Faculty, administration, President, Corporation all agree that this is right for us,” he said. “If we’re not there, we don’t have a solution.”
Last week’s fiery Faculty meeting, which was extended to allow time for further discussion of the social group policy, included the introduction of two motions on the social group policy—an anti-sanctions motion from former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 and another from Government professor Danielle S. Allen.
Allen’s motion seeks to apply the College's Student Handbook standards to co-educational social groups, utilizing a 1989 Massachusetts statute. The motion would also bar students from joining single-gender social groups, and those who opted to join such groups would be subject to expulsion.
“Personally I don’t see all the clear next steps,” Smith said of Allen’s motion. “I’m not a lawyer, so I’m not even going to try to play one here.”
Allen published an op-ed last week in The Crimson defending and clarifying her motion in the face of “confusion.”
Both Lewis’ and Allen’s motions are eligible for a vote in November, but Smith warned against assuming this chapter of the social policy debate will end then.
“I have pretty much learned not to predict what’s going to happen in Faculty meetings. But it’s entirely possible that the Faculty may, as a group, decide that they need more discussion,” Smith said. “I’m not pushing this to a fast conclusion.”
Last year, discussion on the social organization policy dominated a number of Faculty meetings.
“The people I’ve talked to after the Faculty Meeting have all indicated to me that they thought it was a much more productive meeting than the discussions they’ve had about the topic last year,” Smith said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There was no haven to be found. And yet, they persevered, putting forth strong performances against productive players. Competing against relatively familiar competition at the Yale Bulldog Invitational in Brown, Dartmouth, and UMass Amherst, the Harvard women’s tennis team continued to grind its way through the early portion of their fall season.
Led by the tenacious play of captain Annika Ringblom, freshman Anna Li, and freshman Neha Gupta, the Crimson finished with a 1-2 record after falling in a contested match to the Minutemen on Sunday to close out the weekend in New Haven, Conn. Undefeated as a pair in the doubles matches against the Bears and Big Green, Ringblom and Li ended the event identically with a 1-2 record in singles and a 2-1 mark in doubles.
“Anna Li and I were able to sweep doubles this weekend against challenging opponents in the Ivy League,” Ringblom said. “I am proud of the way she competed in singles as well with every single one of her matches going three sets.”
Looking to continue its strong play against Ancient Eight competition after claiming a share of its first Ivy League title since 2009 last spring, Harvard did just that in its opening match against Brown on Friday. The squad finished the day 5-3 and 3-1 in solo and dual play, respectively, against their rivals from Providence.
Four of the Crimson’s five singles victories came from relative newcomers to the team in Gupta, Li and fellow rookies Lia Kiam, and Jenna Moustafa. Completing the weekend with a collective 6-5 record, the freshmen have played competently to begin their Harvard careers.
“The transition from juniors to college tennis is always different for each player, but the freshmen this year have really embraced college tennis and are playing great,” sophomore Irene Lu said. “They all have made contributions in singles and doubles, and it is nice to have them bring their own, new style to the team.”
Gupta, in fact, remains undefeated, 5-0, on the season in singles, having sequentially swept her opponents from Brown, Dartmouth, and UMass Amherst in decisive fashion. The freshman played admirably in doubles, as well, as she and sophomore Jenna Friedel claimed the Crimson’s lone victory in the format against UMass Amherst, 6-4.
Friedel has emerged as one of Harvard’s top doubles performers so far this season, as her lone loss on the weekend came in a tiebreaker to the Dartmouth duo of freshman Abigail Chiu and sophomore Allison McCann. The Mill Valley, Calif. native is just shy of sophomore Lexi Milunovich’s team-leading 4-1 mark.
“As a returning sophomore, Jenna Friedel is getting right back into it as one of our top doubles players,” Ringblom said. “She was able to pair up with multiple partners this weekend to capture some wins with her strong ability to close the net and grind from the baseline.”
Milunovich and Lu also formed a partnership this weekend. The sophomores decidedly won both of their matches as a duo against Ancient Eight competition, as neither of their opponents picked up more than four games. Clearly, doubles proved profitable for the Crimson.
“Our doubles play this weekend was a promising start to this season,” Lu said. “Doubles is something we always like to work on, so it is good we already have a solid base to build from.”
As a 1-7 record displays, singles was not as promising for Harvard against Dartmouth. But polishing off the weekend with a 4-4 showing against the Minutemen in their sunsequent match provided some respite for the squad in solo play.
Having been competitive in each match so far this season, the Crimson looks to continue to build confidence against strong competition that it can utilize in Ivy League play in the spring.
“In my four years, this is definitely the strongest that have seen our team start out in the beginning of the season and I am excited to see how much sharper we can get over the next few tournaments,” Ringblom said. “We are looking forward to getting back to the courts this week to work on our fitness and mental game with more matchplay before our home tournament next weekend.”

Twelve games into the season, the upstart freshman duo of Murphy Agnew and Lauren Raimondo had shown signs of budding chemistry on the front line, but had yet to link up for a goal. That all changed on Saturday, when the Harvard women’s soccer team traveled to Cornell for a conference showdown.
In the 55th minute, with the score at 2-1 in favor of the Crimson and the game still very much up for grabs, Agnew lobbed the ball over the defense to Raimondo, who made it a two-goal cushion with a bottom-corner finish past Big Red junior goalkeeper Meghan Kennedy. The vital goal was Raimondo’s first career tally.
The goal proved to be more than enough, as Harvard (7-5, 1-2 Ivy League) downed Cornell (2-5-2, 0-2-1) for its first Ivy League victory. The game, which finished with a final score of 3-1, saw two players scoring their first career goals and the Crimson also setting a new season-high for shots with 18. The strong performance comes as a much-needed improvement after last weekend’s 3-0 loss at Yale, especially considering the absence of team co-captains Marie Becker and Caroline Chagares due to injury.
“I was really impressed with the way that we approached the game, and we competed from the first minute,” coach Chris Hamblin said.
Harvard came into Ithaca, N.Y., with history on its side. The Crimson is unbeaten against the Big Red in its series history, a record that dates back to 1993. The strong opening half made it clear that Harvard wasn’t giving up that perfect record without a fight.
The Crimson found the back of the net in just the seventh minute, when Niki Young deflected a corner from fellow junior midfielder Leah Mohammadi. The goal was the first of Young’s career, coming in her first Ivy League start.
“We’re trying to get on the end of some of the opportunities we’ve been having, and get on the board,” Chagares said. “It’s awesome that we’re getting [new] people in the box score.”
With the assist, Mohammadi also pushed her team-best points total on the season to 10.
“We’ve been thrilled with [Mohammadi’s] presence on both sides of the ball, both offensively and defensively,” Hamblin said. “It’s really difficult to play against her.”
Harvard’s offense continued to pepper Cornell with shots—the first half alone saw 13 shots for the Crimson, and only three for its opponents. But just five minutes after Young’s goal, the Big Red equalized.
Cornell junior defender Grace Keller caused a turnover by Harvard’s defensive line, and senior forward Paige DeLoach found herself open 15 yards from goal. DeLoach, who was the recipient of the Big Red’s Best Attacking Player award last season, made no mistake with the opportunity and scored after collecting the rebound from an errant initial shot.
The game continued with no further scoring for over 20 minutes. The Crimson had several good looks at Kennedy, including a one-on-one attempt by Agnew. Though she didn’t score, Agnew found redemption in the 38th minute, setting up senior midfielder Dani Stollar for a close-range strike. Stollar’s goal would stand as the game winner.
The second half had a more evenly-matched shot total, with five for Harvard and seven for the Big Red, but Cornell was unable to convert on any chances. Instead, the Crimson extended its lead in the 55th minute through Raimondo.
“The fact that [Raimondo] was able to score against Cornell, give us that little bumper, was great,” Hamblin said.
Seven minutes later, DeLoach was fouled inside Harvard’s box, and the Big Red was handed a chance to close the gap. However, Crimson sophomore goalie Kat Hess didn’t flinch, stopping Cornell freshman midfielder Shelby Wray on the penalty kick.
“If they convert that penalty kick, the last 10 to 12 minutes [get] pretty hectic and dangerous,” Hamblin said. “We’re really glad that [Hess] could come up with the stop and allow us to keep that buffer.”
The win increased Harvard’s series record against the Big Red to 19-0-5, and was the team’s third road victory this year. More than the big-picture stats, though, the Crimson was happy with its offensive performance and its goalies’ composure. As has been the norm this season, Hess and junior Danielle Etzel split time between the posts, combining for four saves.
“They had a few very talented forwards,” Chagares said. “So we wanted to make sure to try to stop them, and our defense and our goalies did a great job.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cornell sits deep in upstate New York. For miles there is nothing but trees and hills until there is suddenly a tall concrete parking garage. Atop that garage sits the the Big Red’s windy football field.
Last Saturday, Harvard made the trek to the top of that hill and, for the first time in since 2005, did not emerge the king. With the 17-14 win, Cornell grabbed both its first Ivy League victory and win of the season. The Crimson fell to 1-1 in division play.
Harvard jumped out on top early, dominating the first and most of the second quarter. A 36-yard connection between freshman Jake Smith and senior Jake Barann with 9:36 remaining in the first half would be the last points the Crimson put on the board. From there, the Big Red’s consistent run game drained both the clock and the defense as they put up 17.
MR. SMITH GOES TO CORNELL
Throughout the entirety of the 2017 season—practices and throughout matchups—there has been a quarterback battle between fifth-year senior and 2016 starter Joe Viviano and Smith. In the past games Coach Tim Murphy has started one, only to bring in the other about halfway through. This Saturday, Murphy went with the rookie and kept him in to the buzzer.
Smith rewarded him with a strong performance. He found the open receivers and displayed excellent pocket awareness throughout the afternoon. On 14 attempts, the freshman completed eight and was intercepted once after a ball was tipped into a defender. On several pass attempts, he dropped the ball into pockets where there seemingly weren’t any. He found receivers freshman Ryan Reagan and Barann on streaks up the middle of the field for more than 30 yard gains. Barann found the end zone and Reagan landed on the five, setting up Harvard’s first touchdown.
It was only in the fourth quarter that Smith’s youth became apparent. The Crimson had three drives in the fourth quarter and the first began at its own one-yard line. Offenses under Smith have had trouble getting started from within their own 10. This drive, junior running back Charlie Booker was given the ball three times and then Harvard returned the ball back to the Big Red with good field possession, allowing them to tack on the winning field goal.
“I thought [Viviano] was a good scrambler,” Cornell coach David Archer said. “I was kind of surprised they didn't give him any snaps but Coach Murphy is an outstanding coach he's got a thought process behind that.”
The next drive Smith was sacked three times. Once for five yards, then for 14 (intentional grounding) and 13 yards. The final sack doubled as a fumble from Smith that was recovered by the Crimson offense. The Big Red received the punt with six minutes left and returned the ball to Harvard with only 35 seconds remaining. Smith was sacked for seven yards on first down. With no timeouts, the Crimson had to spend precious seconds lining up to spike the ball and stop the clock. His third-down pass was tipped and then picked off by a diving Cornell defender. Now with the ball, the Big Red wasted the final seconds away to pull off its first victory against Harvard in 12 years.
FLYING FLAGS
Penalties proved detrimental for both teams but would ravage Cornell’s offense early in the game and the Crimson’s toward the final whistle. In total, the Big Red claimed 13 penalties and lost 106 yards while Harvard lost 67 yards on eight flags.
“[Cornell] played a hard game, they played a smart game, they played a physical game, and they deserved to win,” Murphy said. “Our kids played hard in all phases. At the end of the day, we just made too many mistakes in a very tight game.”
Tied at 14 late in the third quarter the Big Red had the ball and was driving. Its dominant ground game had already overwhelmed the Crimson twice and a touchdown here would be the backbreaker. The second play of the drive, Cornell was docked for a false start. After overcoming that hurdle and notching a first down, a holding call pushed the Big Red back to first-and-20. An errant run and then an illegal substitution left the team with third-and-28. The three penalty drive would prove insurmountable. Though saving grace came in the form of an excellent punt by punter Nickolas Null that was downed at the Harvard one-yard line.
The Crimson’s laundry laden drive came three later. With 9:48 in the fourth and down three, Harvard began pushing toward the Cornell end zone quite efficiently. After a declined holding penalty, Smith found junior wide out Justice Shelton-Mosley for a long third-down conversion. At third-and-two, a false start dropped the Crimson back another five. Smith again converted the third down on a pass to another junior wide receiver, Adam Scott. At the Big Red’s 40, Smith was called for intentional grounding and granted a 14-yard loss. The second-and-24 expanded to third-and-37 after a sack, leading Harvard to punt away on its last good shot at putting more points on the board.
CLOCK KILLERS
Going into the matchup, Cornell knew where its bread and butter would be. The first play from scrimmage attacked the Crimson defensive front and the Big Red never stopped battering its way forward with the run. It took almost two quarters before the defense finally gave way.
Cornell was successful pounded the ball for the majority of the second half, nearly quadrupling Harvard’s rushing yards with 233 to 62. That dominance came on over double the number of attempts the Crimson put forth on the ground with the Big Red handing the ball off 59 times and Harvard trusting its backs 29. In fact, the Crimson had less plays from scrimmage, 44, than Cornell had run plays.
Missing from the Harvard defensive line was junior DJ Bailey and senior Stone Hart. Their absence was apparent.
“When a team is running the ball at you every single play, most of the time, we’ve always been able to stop the run,” senior safety Tanner Lee said. “That’s what we pride our defense in. They did a great job today running it right at us and being consistent and running straight downhill. We have to make sure that we come out next week and fix that because I’m sure other teams will do that down the stretch.”
The number of yards wasn’t so big of a factor, most drives amounted to a punt, but the time the rushes bled off the clock. The Big Red held onto the ball for over 36 minutes while the Crimson had it for just over 23. The divide became clearest in the fourth quarter as Harvard handed Cornell the lead. With six minutes remaining in the game, the Big Red took the ball and essentially just held onto it for five and half minutes, during which the Crimson spent all three of its timeouts. When Harvard received the resulting punt, they had 30 seconds to try and make something happen. Nothing did.
“Our players made plays when the game was on the line,” Archer said. “It just feels awesome, you can't put a price on this one you know what I mean. For as low as you feel when you lose, this is like, I'm floating guys.”

On a warm Saturday afternoon at Mignone Field, the No. 4 Harvard-Radcliffe women’s rugby team (3-1-1, 1-1 Ivy) was unable to mount a comeback against the No. 1 Dartmouth College team in a 39-10 loss. This is the Crimson’s first loss of the season and puts Harvard at a 3-1-1 record for the season, 1-1 Ivy record, and an overall 6-8 record against the Big Green.
The match opened up with aggressive offense from Dartmouth against a staunch Crimson defense. The two teams struggled to push past each other for the first 15 minutes of the game with strong offense and defense from both. However, it was the Big Green that finally broke through the Harvard defense when freshman prop Idia Ihensehkien successfully scored a try to bring Dartmouth to a 5-0 lead.
“We experienced a lot of pressure from Dartmouth today,” sophomore flyhalf Delia Hellander said, “which we haven’t yet faced this season, so we struggled with our shape and executing our pattern play.”
The Big Green continued to pressure the Harvard defense. Five minutes affter the Crimson successfully thwarted and Dartmouth attempt and mounted an offense off of it, the Big Green had a successful try from junior flyhalf Camille Johnson followed by a conversion from junior scrumhalf Kat Ramage to widen the lead to 12-0. Heading into the half, the Harvard defense suffered one more blow when freshman center Lilly Durbin scored a try to give Dartmouth a 17-0 lead at whistle.
“This game was a great challenge,” sophomore Emily Prentice said “and pushed us to execute our system under pressure, moving forward we’ll be working on our execution and connections.”
The Crimson came back onto the field into the second half with renewed energy and a strong offensive display the opening minutes. With 28 minutes left in the second half, Harvard pushed through a mound of Dartmouth players allowing freshman Erin Wright to score the first Crimson try of the game, her personal first try of the season, to cut the lead to 17-5.  The Big Green responded with two tries from senior Frankie Sands. Despite the best efforts of the Harvard defense, Dartmouth was able to increase its lead to 32-5 when sophomore Evan Klein scored a try followed by a successful conversion from Ramage.
With minutes remaining in the match, the Crimson pushed back against the Dartmouth defense again. Freshman Milan Roberts added to the Harvard scoreline with a skilled pickup after a Crimson kick to successfully score a try, her eighth of the season, to bring the score to 32-10 with 3 minutes remaining in the match.
However, despite its best efforts, Harvard was unable to mount a comeback with sophomore Berit DeGrandpre scoring one more try for the Big Green at the end of the match for a final scoreline of 39-10 Dartmouth.
“We just kept remembering that it was just a game,” Hellander said “and if we trusted in our training good things will happen. We used this game as a milestone to see where we are and we’ll use it to come back stronger for the next match.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the first-to-three points structure that is college volleyball, games can last as short as one hour or as long as three hours.
The Harvard women’s volleyball team (9-5, 4-1 Ivy League) saw both extremes this weekend, as it finished as the beneficiaries of a long five-set victory against Penn (7-7, 2-3) while suffering a quick three-set loss against Princeton.
For the Crimson, Saturday’s loss to the Tigers (12-3, 5-0) was a difficult reminder of the degree of difficulty facing the team if it hopes to seek the Ivy title. Having defeated Ancient Eight opponents such as Dartmouth and Columbia with ease so far, Princeton demonstrated a much more challenging opponent, at the caliber that Harvard will most likely see in upcoming weeks.
PRINCETON 3, HARVARD 0
The Crimson was humbled by its Ancient Eight opponent, succumbing to a tough straight set-loss to Princeton Saturday night to mark its first Ivy loss.
“It was emotionally and physically draining that first night [after the Penn win],” junior blocker Jocelyn Meyer said. “That was our first long bus trip and we have had people in and out of practice being sick so that probably played into it too. I think the biggest thing that fell apart in that match was our serve-and-pass game, Princeton got at least eight aces on us, so we weren’t able to run off and play our match.”
In the first set, Princeton’s front-line offensive weapons in 6’4” sophomore hitter Maggie O’Connell and 6’3 junior middle blocker Nnenna Ibe tallied for a combined nine kills. The Tigers leaped ahead 11-4, and continued maintaining control throughout the set.
Despite two kills from junior co-captain Christina Cornelius, Harvard was limited to just 12 points in the set and largely depended on Princeton errors for its points.
“Princeton came out firing on all cylinders, which knocked us down,” senior hitter Paige Kebe said. “It took us too long to regain our footing and fight back.”
Set two saw rather similar results, as the Crimson tallied just 13 points in the set.
Unlike the first set however, Harvard managed to maintain an even score with the Tigers up to 10-10, but could not withstand another powerful Princeton run that saw this score widen dramatically to 25-13.
One positive takeaway for the Crimson was the featuring of a wider pool of players on the team.
Sophomore libero Isabelle Tashima saw her first action of Ivy League play, playing in two sets with an assist and a dig.
Harvard had its best performance in the final set, maintaining a tight score up to 16-16. Like the prior frame however, the Tigers buckled down at the tail end of the set. Launching a 7-2 run, Princeton finished the game in dominant fashion.
In the three sets, the Tigers finished with a .419 hitting percentage, compared to just .113 for the Crimson. Additionally, Princeton limited itself to just 10 errors in the game, while Harvard tallied 17.
HARVARD 3, PENN 2
Friday night ended on a much more positive note, as the Crimson handed the Quakers its third Ivy defeat of the season at the Palestra in Philadelphia, Pa.
“We really worked hard as a team and challenged their defense,” Kebe said, “We had all sorts of personnel on the court and everyone did their jobs. It was overall a good evening.”
The Crimson averaged a .323 hitting percentage, with major contributions from Meyer and sophomore hitter Grace Roerts compared to the .233 percentage put up by Penn.
The two teams had a tough-fought opening set, but slightly more accurate hits and two fewer errors by the Quakers was sufficient in clinching a 25-21 victory for the hosts.
Harvard bounced back in sets two and three, but did so in alternative fashion. While sprinting out to an early lead in set two, the Crimson fought a more methodical battle with Penn in the third set before breaking out near the end of the set.
The Quakers held up their composure against the away favorites and battled back to a 25-22 fourth set win. Senior Hayley Molnar led the home team with 15 kills, while the rest of the team fed a combined 46 assists.
Only a tiebreaker would suffice to settle this tough-fought match.
Here, Harvard demonstrated its resiliency, finishing the Quakers 15-6 after coming out with a 8-2 run.

The No. 14 Harvard men’s water polo team went a perfect 2-0 on the weekend, pulling out two victories in two very close games. Saturday afternoon, the Crimson defeated No. 15 Brown 11-10 in overtime. Its success rolled over into the second game of the day, defeating crosstown rival MIT 10-8. Harvard improved its record to 11-4 this season and 3-2 in conference play.
“I think that we have great leadership that helps to guide us in those situations (close games), and we feed off the presence of the older guys who have been in plenty of those situations before,” sophomore Austin Sechrest said. “We also have a great group of guys top to bottom and we all support each other no matter what, and it helps us to stay calm and feed off one another late in close games.”
HARVARD 11 BROWN 10
Freshman Dennis Blyashov, last week’s Northeast water polo conference rookie of the week, started things off for the Crimson with the first goal of the game. Junior Nick Bunn followed with his own goal and Blyashov then found the back of the net again to end the first quarter with a 3-1 lead against the Bears.
The Crimson held on to the lead and controlled the entirety of the first half heading into the halftime break with a narrow 5-4 advantage, thanks to goals from Sechrest and Bunn. In the second half both teams battled for the advantage, but regulation time proved to be not enough. At the end of the fourth quarter, the score was locked at 8-8, after a last minute Brown goal, forcing overtime.
“Of course we were a little disheartened to give up a game-tying goal with one second left in regulation against Brown, but I thought our team did a great job of regrouping and trusting that we were conditioned well and could win in overtime,” Sechrest said. “All overtime games are exhausting and it really just comes down to using all of the energy still in the tank to stay mentally sharp and finish our opportunities.”
In overtime, Harvard was able to outscore Brown by one goal to earn the victory. Freshman Bruno Snow and senior co-captain Colin Chiapello netted the first two overtime goals while junior Nathan Ondracek scored the game-winner for Harvard.
“We have played a lot of OT games the past few years so we’re used to it,” senior co-captain Harry Tafur said. “Our strategy doesn’t change much. The periods are 3 minutes instead of 8 so there’s less time to work with but other than that we don’t stress too much.”
HARVARD 10 MIT 8
The Crimson faced off against MIT saturday night on the Beavers’ home turf. Tensions always run high for the matchup between the two Cambridge teams, but Harvard has been able to bring home the victory for the past 13 meetings, and this weekend followed the same pattern.
“The MIT game was electric; they always bring out a rowdy crowd for our crosstown rivalry, and this game was no different,” Sechrest said. “Their fans were loud and obnoxious and personally, I fed off the energy.”
Bunn opened the Crimson’s offense with the first goal of the game. Sophomore Charlie Owens followed with another goal. Harvard ended the first half outpacing MIT 7-5.
In the second half the Crimson matched MIT’s three goals to secure the win. Freshman Jackson Enright, Chiapello, and Sechrest all scored for the Crimson. Sechrest ended the game with a hat trick.

MEN’S LIGHTWEIGHT CREW
Making its season debut Saturday at the Head of the Housatonic regatta, the Harvard men’s lightweight crew emerged with some auspicious results.
Most impressive was the open men’s pair, in which Crimson boats finished in each of the top four spots, led by the pair of sophomore Nick Barry and freshman Drake Deuel with a time of 15:31.2. Shortly after them were sophomores Chris Skokowski and Hunter Wallace at 15:38.6, followed by freshman Thomas Satterthwaite and junior David Wexner at 15:42.9 and junior Rob Lowe and senior André Dupuis at 15:52.4.
“The fall races are not quite as intense as the spring, partly because of the format,” said Barry, referring to the fact that a “head” race is in the style of a time trial rather than a toe-to-toe competition.
The course itself was slightly more than 4.5 kilometers long on the Housatonic River in Derby, Conn., one of the home sites of the Yale crew team.  Temperatures around 70 degrees and light winds made for an unseasonably pleasant environment.
In the open men’s single, freshman Sean Hayes took second place with a time of 16:36.9. Senior Jordan Rogers finished 14th with 17:29.7.
The team was less successful in the varsity eight, but the boat led by Dupuis in the stroke seat managed a top-ten finish in a 27-boat field (12:55.4). The four other Harvard entries finished 11th, 13th, 22nd and 25th.
Moreover, in the last event—the varsity four with coxswain—the boat with sophomore Michael Genovesi in the stroke took first place in a four-boat field with a time of 14:22.3. Next came the boat under junior Eryk Dobrushkin in second place with 14:26.8. The Crimson’s third boat in the race, led by sophomore Tomas Spiers, finished a distant fourth at 14:53.7.
WOMEN’S LIGHTWEIGHT AND HEAVYWEIGHT CREW
The women’s lightweight and heavyweight crew teams likewise made their first appearance of the season, competing in the same four events. The heavyweight team came away with a commanding victory in the pair. Junior Rafaela Stalph and senior Sofia Donnecke finished with a time of 16:19.2, more than 30 seconds ahead of second place. Junior Hailey Novis and senior Erica Holmes took fourth with 16:55.2, while the lightweight pair of seniors Alanah Anderson and Adah Bielawski, competing in the same field, finished sixth with 17:00.7.
The Crimson women also snagged three of the top four spots in the varsity four with coxswain, including a win at 15:29.2 by the boat led by heavyweight junior Stephanie Eble. Lightweight Claire Albert led her boat to a second-place finish in 16:00.2.
Fourth place in the field of 16 went to the boat with junior Josie Theile in the stroke, which came in at 16:02.7. The other four Crimson boats finished sixth, ninth, 13th and 15th.
Heavyweight freshman Eliza Kallfelz was the high finish in the single. She finished in 18:35.7, good for sixth. Thiele’s boat managed fourth place in the varsity eight with 13:09.3, followed by the boat under heavyweight sophomore Charlotte Medway in seventh out of 23 at 14:18.3. The other Crimson boats in the heat finished 12th, 16th, 19th and 23rd.
The Head of the Housatonic is an annual regatta held by the New Haven Rowing Club. High school, college and club teams from around the Northeast compete in various races.
The competition marked Harvard’s first races since the Intercollegiate Rowing Association National Championships in June. The real meat of the season, however, will come in the spring, leaving the team about four months from December to March to train over the winter.
More immediately, though, the Housatonic served as a tune-up for next weekend’s Head of the Charles, one of the three so-called fall classics and always the centerpiece of the first half of the rowing season.
“The Head of the Charles is definitely the major event of the fall,” Genovesi said. “We used this as a practice on the road to get ready.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With its infamously challenging 238-yard ninth, The Course at Yale consistently ranks among the most difficult in the country. Yet, the Crimson women’s golf team, who placed sixth of 16 teams in 2015 and fourth of 19 teams in 2016, has only seen improvement at the Yale Invitational that took place this past weekend, but was cut short due to inclement weather conditions on Sunday.
Ending play two shots behind Delaware on Saturday, the Harvard team managed to close the gap on Sunday and tie the Blue Hens for third placed with a total of 594 points and 26 over par.  In the tournament of fifteen, the Crimson finished behind only Scottish competitor Stirling, who dominated at 12 over par, followed by Lamar, who finished 22 over par.
“It’s a good result in the field. We were the top Ivy school so [the results] compared pretty well,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads said. “We have won [the tournament] before and then we also have finished a little bit down. I like where we were, and I just wish we had the last day to build on some of the momentum that we were creating in the second round.”
The Harvard women’s golf team was led by 2016 All-Ivy League First Team player, Michelle Xie, along with up-and-coming freshman Belinda Hu, who finished second for Harvard at both the Nittany Lion and Princeton Invitational earlier this season. This year was a significant improvement for junior Xie, who last year placed 18th overall with a +4 146. This year, Xie tied Lamar’s Elodie Chapelet for fourth place with a shot total of 144 after scores of 72 in both the first and second round. Hu trailed not far behind in seventh place.Round 1 proved to be a challenge for most of the Crimson women’s golfers, including junior Anna Zhou, who finished the first round with a score of 78, along with freshman Jessica Luo, who finished with 79. This slow start to the weekend had to do with many factors, including adjusting to the difficult course.“The Course at Yale is one of the more challenging ones we play. It asks a lot from tee to green.” Rhoads said. “The course [requires you] to be able to hit it hard and high. You need to be able to be able to control distance and direction well. The greens are also massive; they have a lot of slope on them…And then there a lot of subtleties around the hole…so you could be doing well, and not seeing a lot of puts go in.”Since the Invitational was a Friday to Sunday tournament, the Harvard women’s golf team played their practice round much earlier than their usual practice round the day before the tournament, possibly contributing further to the team’s slow start. “We actually played our practice round a couple weeks earlier,” Rhoads said. “We didn’t get to play our normal day before practice round and I think that probably affected us a little in our ability to sharpen and score”
Yet, the Crimson did not let this slow start keep the team down during the tournament. With the perfect weather conditions on Saturday and the improved familiarity of the course, almost all players on the Harvard women’s golf team were more successful in the second round. Zhou put together a score of 73 in the second round and Lou saw an improvement with a score of 76. Most notably, freshman Belinda Hu fired a 70, good enough for the lowest round score of the day.
The Yale Invitational marks the three-quarter mark of the season and a continuation of the strong performance set by the Harvard women’s golf team at last week’s Princeton Invitational. The Crimson has the Lady Blue Hen Invitational on October 21st and will be preparing for this last tournament of the season in the upcoming weeks.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Past performance is not indicative of future results”: so often seen in the fine print of historical financial data, the phrase applied in Saturday’s soccer game. In its penultimate road match of the season, the Harvard men’s soccer team (2-6-2, 1-1 Ivy League) faced off against a team it had not lost to since 2012, including a 4-0 route in 2016.
This year was different from the previous years, as a historically weaker Cornell (5-3-2, 1-0-1) had a relatively strong start to the season, and went into the match riding on a five game winning streak. Combine this with a home field advantage, and the Crimson now faced a formidable opponent. Though it fought hard, most notably dominating the last 40 minutes, Harvard’s efforts were not enough for it to be able to leave Berman field in Ithaca, N.Y., with its second conference win.
“We fought really hard --especially in the second half--and we had plenty of chances,” co-captain and defender Justin Crichlow said. “We just couldn’t put one in the back of the net, which is frustrating, but that’s just how the game goes sometimes.”
The teams were evenly matched in the first few minutes of the game. Both teams picked up early fouls, and the Harvard defense set well-timed offside traps. In the first nine minutes of the game, neither side recorded a shot.
That deadlock ended in the 10th minute, as the Big Red’s offense was awarded a corner kick. Ryan Hill connected with teammate George Pedlow on a corner kick, who managed to outcompete the Crimson to get a header past senior goalie Kyle Parks.
“Unfortunately they scored early on, and we really couldn’t get back at them by scoring,” freshman midfielder/forward Paolo Belloni-Urso said. “We tried everything-- we...pressured them in their half and unfortunately we weren’t able to score.”
The Crimson was not deterred by the early goal, but it took another six minutes for the team to get a shot on goal, which came courtesy of sophomore striker Philip Hausen. After Hausen’s initial blocked header, several more opportunities came, with several players contributing to the attack. Cornell’s defense was tough to crack, and remained unyielding, keeping Harvard off the score sheet in the first half.
Harvard kept up the intensity in the second half. Defensively, the back line held to allow no more goals. Parks recorded six saves, including taking on Cornell’s Brady Dickens one-on-one and managing to get a single foot on the ball to get it out of bounds.
On the other end of the field, the team was amping up the pressure. Just as in the first half, Harvard was kept away from Cornell’s goal for the first few minutes of the half. In the 54th minute, Belloni-Urso and senior midfielder Christian Sady recorded two back-to-back shots of their own, only to be stopped both times by the Big Red goalie, senior Mitchell Meyer.
“I’m proud of the guys for leaving everything out there on the field,” Crichlow said. “[Cornell] outcompeted us in the first half and we definitely outcompeted them in the second half.”
The team continued the intensity throughout the half, especially in the last 15 minutes of the game. The team had several chances to get the equalizer with several corner kicks, but each of its attempt was thwarted by Cornell’s defense. Even Parks left his usual spot in between the posts to add an extra man to the offense. The goalie participated in a corner kick and got a shot off in a last-minute effort that ultimately came up short.
With the last few games of the season at hand, every game counts and a loss is never welcome. But once again, the phrase “past performance is not indicative of future results” applies to Harvard-- its past results in matches will in no way determine how it will perform in the last games of the season. The team’s fate in the Ivy League remains in its control, though with little room for error.
“All the guys on the team know it’s still in our hands,” Crichlow said. “We still have a great shot to win the Ivy League championship. We just need to make sure we’re correcting things that need to be corrected, and we definitely have to win the rest of our games.”
“I think we need to work on how to stay calm and try to play our style of game and not get away from that...no matter what the score is,” Belloni-Urso added.

We’re a month into the fall semester, which means you’ve finally figured out your schedule. You're probably at the point where you take regular lunch breaks now. Health and nutrition are supes important. So, you linger a little in the lunch line. Why not? You're totally not checking out the cutie by the coffee machines. Not at all.
Yeah, we don’t buy it. It’s time to be honest: you have a d-hall crush. There are a few scientific rules for what defines these crushes, and Flyby is here to break down this phenomenon for you.
Location
The context in which you see this person is extremely limited. Not walking through the corridors of your House. Not hurrying from class to class in the Yard. You only see them at meals, in the dining hall. For all you know they’re a figment of your imagination conjured up by hunger and sleep deprivation.
Limited interaction
Your interactions have been minimal and, unfortunately, not non-verbal in the way you’d prefer. Maybe you know their name, but they probably don’t know yours. They probably don’t know you exist, actually.
Conventional attractiveness
It shames you a little, but this person is attractive enough that they make you feel very basic. Don’t get us wrong—they’re attractive. But could you be any less imaginative?
Attempts to impress
Most of your dining decisions are to show them how #fit and #healthy you are, and how much you totally love your own body! You pile veggies on your plate when they’re around, and you definitely skip dessert.
It’s in the details
They look really good in that one T-shirt. (You know the one.) You’ve never really cared for ‘Infinite Jest’ before, but they were reading it over lunch the other day so maybe you should give it a try? You refer to them by a random epithet or nickname: green polo guy. Blondie. Denim skirt girl. Kid with the Beats. Anything that’s nondescript enough for you to drop in conversation without having to worry about who’s listening (no one is). Really, it’s the little things that make this d-hall crush so captivating.
Mandatory embarrassing experience
You have horrifically embarrassed yourself at least once in their presence. Dropped a food item on the floor? Spilled juice all over yourself? Tripped and dropped your whole tray? It’s all happening, baby. This disastrous moment plays in your head every night before you fall asleep. Your d-hall crush probably didn’t notice it, but that doesn’t mean you won’t agonize over every moment.
(Un)Availability
Maybe they’re in a relationship. Maybe you’re not their type at all. Maybe you’re only crushing on them because you’re too afraid of commitment to actually emotionally invest in someone who could care for you in return. Who knows? What matters is that they’ll never be anything more than someone you worship from afar.
