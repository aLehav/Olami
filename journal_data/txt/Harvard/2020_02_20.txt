After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Square is known for its diversity of dining options — we have Korean fried chicken at BonChon, vegan heaven at Veggie Grill, and late-night burritos at El Jefe’s, to name a few. But Harvard Square has historically lacked the one place college-student-foodies gravitate towards: a boba spot. Boston Tea Spot and Dado Tea have tried to fill this demand, but all eyes are on Kung Fu Tea, the area's newest contestant.
The Harvard Square Kung Fu Tea (KFT) opened its doors at 1160 Massachusetts Avenue during January, kicking off with drink deals up to 50 percent off. The original franchise began in 2010 in Queens, New York, and has since expanded locations to Australia, Cambodia, Canada, Taiwan, and Japan. KFT is now a staple in the NYC boba tea scene, and its arrival in Harvard Square has generated plenty of excitement.
To investigate all the hype, I went to try it out. The KFT menu offers lots of variety, dividing their products into Classic, Milk Tea, Punch, Milk Cap, Yogurt, Slush, Milk Strike, Espresso, and Seasonal drinks. KFT also gives customers the option to adjust sugar and ice levels, add toppings such as bubbles or red bean, and substitute milk options. This range can be daunting and incredibly overwhelming to strangers to the boba scene.
After sampling the chain’s baseline drinks, the Kung Fu Milk Tea and and the Winter Melon Green Tea, a few things become apparent. First, the unadjusted, incredibly sweet taste immediately induces a mild sugar high, but can be easily altered to fit one’s preferences. Second, the actual boba (or bubbles, if you’re an East Coaster) is small and mediocre, only making the drink sweeter and not on par with the quality of the tea. Third, all the extra flavorings and toppings easily overpower the quality of the tea itself. KFT may pride itself on its use of real tea leaves and fresh brewing practices, but in most of their drinks — particularly the speciality drinks like Slushes and Milk Caps — the emphasis moves away from the tea and onto the gimmicks.
While the vast amount of flavors, forms, and toppings means there’s something for everybody, the KFT menu looks too much like the constantly expanding Starbucks menu, only with the option to add boba. To their credit, KFT’s inclusion of distinctly Asian-influenced flavors like Longan Jujube, Sesame Matcha, and Taro sets them apart from Starbucks and harkens back to their original mission of emulating Taiwanese boba shops. However, drinks like the Italian Mocha Slush and Pumpkin Oolong Milk Tea play more into social media foodie trends rather than authentic, well-made boba tea.
These untraditional drinks aren’t disgusting, but they are wholly unnecessary for the menu and attract more hype and publicity than actual customers. This trend, however, is not isolated to the KFT boba-giant, but rather a larger practice spreading throughout boba chains. Gong Cha, which started in Taiwan but now spans fifteen countries, similarly offers untraditional menu items like Caramel Chocolate Slush and Hibiscus Green Tea. Looking at their menus, both Gong Cha and KFT offer delicious, high quality tea and house-made boba, but they also include drink options and flavors that seem to negate their emphasis on traditional tea and authenticity.
This move away from traditional Taiwanese flavors is perhaps more indicative of the growing popularity of boba in the U.S. than a distracted focus of these boba chains. While these speciality flavors are far from “authentic boba,” they appeal to American tastes. For long-time boba drinkers, it may be hard to accept these new additions to classic menus as anything more than pandering and publicity stunts — but the nonstop growth of the boba industry in the U.S. promises to only bring about more options and varieties for this childhood favorite.
Despite opposition to its ever-expanding menu, KFT serves as a new landmark of Asian-American culture in Harvard Square. Its role as a boba-only shop, as opposed to Dado Tea’s food and tea menu, provides a place for students to enjoy refreshing drinks, gather and socialize, and try new trends.
KFT won’t be the last boba chain to stir up hype in Harvard Square: Eater Boston reports that Tiger Sugar, a popular international Taiwanese boba chain, plans to move into the area. Tiger Sugar’s menu brings a whole new variety of drinks and questions of authenticity to the table, and it is sure to bring even more longtime boba lovers and boba newcomers to Harvard Square.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I arrived at Harvard, one of my primary concerns was not making friends or picking my classes, but rather navigating the dining hall. I have life-threatening allergies to milk and tree nuts. I’ve needed an EpiPen on multiple occasions despite taking extreme caution every day and have ended up in the emergency room in the aftermath of these reactions.
So it’s not surprising that my food allergies were an incredibly important consideration in choosing a college. There was no margin for error; I would be eating at this new school three times a day for four years. After facing challenging dining experiences at two different school dining halls in middle and high school, I recognized the weight of my decision.
Recent articles have presented student criticisms of the dining experience for students with food allergies and celiac disease at Harvard. A few students have expressed concerns about the possibility of cross-contamination in the self-serve areas and the fact that complete and updated ingredient lists must be accessed online rather than posted by each food. One student wrote that the “email method,” in which students with food allergies order individualized cooked-to-order meals by sending an email to dining services, was “reinventing the wheel.” Ironically, this is exactly the program I had hoped to find in a college dining hall.
I am one of the students on the “email method.” I email Annenberg each night and let them know what time I’ll be eating meals during the next day and what I’d like for each meal. They’ll make me a safe version of anything they have available and double-check all ingredients. I usually order a “safe” version of something from the grill menu, but any time there’s something special like mussels or salmon (personal favorites) on the line, I’ve emailed and asked whether it was possible to cook them in a way that avoided my allergens. On each occasion, the dish that appeared filled me with gratitude because it was clear how much thought and attention had been put into creating a safe dish for me.
There’s no doubt that the “email method” requires a bit of planning on the student’s part. As I was deciding on what college to attend, I met with the dining hall manager and head chef and expressed concern about the email method, and particularly about what would happen if my plans changed last minute. Annenberg’s manager assured me that they understood that students’ plans are fluid, and that there would be no consequences if I ordered a meal and didn’t pick it up. No harm, no foul. There have been times when I’ve arrived early for a meal or forgotten to place my order the night before. In each instance, a chef has cheerfully asked me to wait just five minutes while they prepared a safe made-to-order meal. I am constantly appreciative of the unflagging devotion of the Annenberg team to student health and well-being.
By definition, a food allergy is a marker of difference. For years, I sat awkwardly at birthday parties while my friends had pizza and ice cream. College is no different. Nearly every event requires intervention. Whether it’s the Crimson Jam or simply dinner at a restaurant with a friend, food is a part of nearly everything we do. I understand the desire to inhabit the world like everyone else, to pull food off the line without checking ingredients online or placing an order the night before. For me, the goal is always safety and the fact that HUDS has a process in place to keep me safe (a process that has, to date, resulted in zero reactions while in college) is far more important than the ability to wait in line with hundreds of my closest friends.
Of course, I would never presume to speak for all students with allergies at Harvard. We are all different, whether it’s the sensitivity of our allergy or our level of comfort in trusting others to cook our food. Having food allergies means that in order to keep ourselves safe, we lose a certain amount of spontaneity. Can Harvard do better? Clearly some people think so, and I suspect that Harvard’s structure of a separate dining hall for each house presents unique challenges for students who don’t know in what dining hall they’ll be eating the next day. Fair enough. But I’m grateful that Harvard offers a cook-to-order program and that every single HUDS worker I’ve ever spoken to has shown through word and deed that my safety and happiness matters. As students with allergies speak up about their dining needs, let’s not forget that these are real people working to keep us safe. Suggesting that we shouldn’t have to experience a moment of inconvenience or lose a tiny bit of spontaneity when there is quite literally a chef waiting to cook you your very own safe meal while you skip the line reeks of entitlement. I have deep gratitude for the ways in which the workers at Annenberg have made my Harvard experience exponentially easier (and less stressful) than I expected it to be.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 2013, we expressed hope that edX, which we saw as “the future of scholarship,” would be allowed to grow in its scope and range of content. Today, we applaud the launch of LabXchange — an interactive learning platform that will bring free, quality science education to students around the world. The result of a collaboration between the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and the Amgen Foundation, this initiative utilizes the open-source infrastructure from edX to create a virtual scientific lab environment, particularly for students in areas without the infrastructure necessary for lab-setting experimentation.
As technology’s potential to reshape education — and particularly to expand its accessibility — is considerable, we are glad that Harvard is working to set the standard for high-quality, widely available online education. We encourage the platform’s use of interactive formats and other multimedia tools to make online content engaging, and we hope that LabXchange keeps innovating the ways in which it delivers information to students.
But more than the novelty and potential of educational technology, we are heartened by the ways this technology is being utilized. As funding for education has remained inadequate and inequitable, we commend Harvard for its efforts to make scientific education more accessible to all. These efforts are critical in guaranteeing access to knowledge and increasing social mobility for those with limited access to more conventional institutional approaches to learning. We have previously affirmed the utility of the Extension School in encouraging social mobility, and we appreciate the bite-sized nature of these modules, which better serves those who may not have the time to commit to a full course offered by the Extension School through edX. As of right now, the diversity of scientific fields offered through the program is laudable and we hope that Harvard will continue to expand its online education program in the humanities.
That said, we recognize that LabXchange cannot fully replace the experience of having the opportunity to be in a real lab and actually do hands-on work. There are certainly components, such as providing modes of interaction and the ability to ask and answer questions, that can be added to the current program in order to enhance learning experiences and more accurately capture in-class environment. But there is still a long way to go, and we believe that the current program is a good start to remedy the inequities in learning.
All in all, we hope that the University continues to pursue its efforts in making education accessible and devoting its resources to enriching society as a whole. The LabXchange launch is, indeed, representative of the sort of general approach toward engagement with the broader community — including high schoolers, working adults, and those around the world — that we would like Harvard to embody in all of its endeavors.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A store closes in Harvard Square. Tributes flood in, recalling fond memories of afternoons spent in a coffee shop, or a warm bowl of soup on a cold winter night. Inevitably, the topic of rising rents in Harvard Square comes up, and many conclude that some greedy landlord was responsible for pushing out yet another historic establishment. It seems that they do this stuff for fun. The story becomes even juicier when we remember that, lately, a few of these landlords have been investment firms. Yes, now the narrative is shaping up well: wealthy investors are destroying local businesses.
This story is convenient, but it’s incomplete. That’s because we pretty much absolve ourselves — the consumer — of any responsibility for the closures. In truth, we too hold responsibility, because the stores are, after all, there for us. That is the nature of business.
If we had wanted Crema Cafe to stay open, we should have frequented it more. Crema’s owner told this newspaper that “Crema sales dropped 30 to 35 percent in two years” before its lease wasn’t renewed. “I don’t fault the landlord,” he said. Neither should we. As someone who was fond of Crema and Papyrus, among other bygone stores, I would have loved for them to stay open. But I also recognize that not enough other consumers went to those establishments, and my occasional coffee or annual Christmas card was not sufficient to warrant a location in the square.
Put bluntly, property owners aim to find the most profitable tenants, which are the businesses that can attract the most customers; if a landlord replaces an existing tenant with a store that is less popular, they’ll lose money themselves. In turn, stores with high demand last and become staples of the square. That’s how we got places like El Jefe’s (October 2015) and Tatte (October 2016). Investment firms that buy properties in the square are no different.
Interestingly, in our popular narrative, the phrase “investment firm” seems to be closely associated with the mental image of a mustachioed Monopoly man holding bags of money. But that’s hardly the case. Let’s look at Asana Partners, for instance, which is a commonly cited antagonist in the square closures story.
It turns out that Asana’s major investors include a litany of pension funds: the Los Angeles City Employees’ Retirement System, the Los Angeles Fire & Police Pension System, the New Mexico State Investment Council, the South Carolina Retirement System, the Tennessee Consolidated Retirement System. The list goes on.
In fact, the largest investors in the investment firms that we generally love to lambast — ranging from real estate investment trusts to hedge funds — are often pension funds and endowments. The Los Angeles City Employees’ Retirement System pays out benefits to its more than 17,000 retirees by investing in firms that provide a sufficient return.
Every U.S. state has such funds — sometimes separate for teachers and firefighters and public servants. Individual cities have them too. Harvard has a massive endowment, as do many other schools, from the University of Texas system to Yale University. It turns out that a more accurate mental image of those profiting from Flat Patties’ demise would probably be of firefighters and public school teachers — and maybe even professors and students of other universities.
That is not to say that firefighters’ pension benefits warrant the closing of the square’s old businesses; that’s a value judgment where people can disagree. But landlords aren’t closing stores to spite us; they’re doing it because they think we’ll shop, eat, and drink at their new tenants.
Even if newer stores in the square aren’t frequented most by students, there must still be demand coming from somewhere, if the stores last. If the demand is from tourists, we may not like their preferences, but they nevertheless matter. Indeed, this should probably make us feel even more responsible for square closures as Harvard students, because our institution brings them here. And if the demand is from other Boston area residents, then we have even less to complain about. They actually live here long-term, while we are only transplants for a few years. In any case, we shouldn’t call upon government intervention to stop the closures either.
Calling on a government authority to limit what the owners of land can do with their own property would be contrary to the basis of a free society. And quite authoritarian. If an individual owns a plot of land, they have the right to decide who can operate there. My mandating who could live in your house would be a gross violation of your basic freedom. In just the same vein, it would be very illiberal for a fan of Zambrero to insist that it be mandated by the city to stay there, whether through artificially low rent or something else.
If we truly want certain stores in the square, the strongest action we can justly take is to put our money where our mouth is. When we like a business, we should go to it more often. And if a landlord replaces it with one we don’t like, we should avoid it. On second thought, though, the firefighters might not like that.

What is it about twinkly lights that transforms a repurposed warehouse?
It’s the night before Valentine’s Day, and I’m in the trendy Somerville event space Warehouse XI. Tonight, it houses the Boston Women’s Market Self Love Potion, which boasts a mocktail bar and about ten vendors selling clothes, jewelry, and skincare products. I note the t-shirts that say “feminist” in cursive lettering.
I’m slightly incredulous — why is it called a self-love potion? I certainly don’t see any potions in the cauldron-y sense. And besides the branding, this event doesn’t look any different from a collection of boutique shops. I feel skeptical of marketing that sells products typically targeted at women, just rebranded as self-love.
After checking in at the front table, I speak with Africa M. Rubio and Cara W. Loffredo, co-founders of the Boston Women’s Market. The main space is too loud and crowded with pre-professional twenty-somethings to have a conversation, so they lead me to the “Instagram room.” Inside, two spotlights illuminate a painted floral mural on the back wall. If neoliberalism is God, then Instagram is Mother Mary and the phenomenon of self-care Baby Jesus.
For the past three years, the Boston Women’s Market has served as “a network that promotes the work of and preserves a space for Womxn entrepreneurs and artists in the New England area,” according to its website. This Self-Love Potion event kicks off the group’s programming for 2020, Loffredo tells me. With over 20 events scheduled for this year and more than 200 vendors on their waiting lists, what began as a one-time marketplace in Jamaica Plain now spans the entire Boston area.
Keeping vendor fees low remains a top priority for the cofounders. “Instead of paying a fee for a table and a space at our events, we want [vendors] to reinvest the money they make at our events in their business,” Loffredo explains. “So the more fundraising opportunities we can create like this, the more efficient we can be.”
After my conversation with Loffredo and Rubio, I realize that the promotion of self-love isn’t necessarily the event’s goal, at least in the consumerist sense. Though it does tacitly embrace the idea that “self-love” can be purchased in the form of a blouse or a face mask, the point of the Self-Love Potion, like all the BWM marketplaces, has more to do with the economic empowerment of women-owned small business than the commodification of self-care.
Walking through the market, I see more variety in the vendors than I expected. “Do you want to talk about periods?” a woman asks from behind a yellow-clothed table in the middle of the room.
“Of course,” I respond.
Katie Y. Diasti, the Founder & CEO of Viv for Your V, is selling sustainable pads and liners made from bamboo and corn fiber packaged in aesthetically pleasing boxes. Her online shop offers both of these products, as well as a monthly delivery service. While chatting with Diasti about the softness of corn fiber and the antibacterial properties of bamboo, I notice a phallic wooden paper stand across across the room. I take Diasti’s card, apologize, and explain that I am more of a tampon girl but vehemently support the cause before heading to the mysterious table.
Unlike many of the skincare and clothing vendors, the representatives for Harbor Health, a community health center and education provider, aren’t selling any products. Rather, they’re spreading awareness about the center’s services, giving out safer sex barriers, and talking about healthy relationships.
“Our department does health education and community outreach,” explains Ashley D. Prettyman, a health educator with Harbor Health’s community outreach program. “That entails two major parts: One is nutrition-based, and the other is sexual-based — healthy relationships, domestic violence. We try to combat [these things] through education and through access.”
For a prize opportunity, I can spin a wheel for a healthy relationship discussion topic or fill out an anatomy sheet. I opt for the wheel. I land on a slot that reads, “someone hurt you,” and Prettyman and I discuss how to include more “I-statements” in my emotional confrontations.
Before I leave, I tell Prettyman that I didn’t expect to see an organization like Harbor Health at the Self-Love Potion. I anticipated Instagram walls, rosewater sprays, and expensive t-shirts — and, to be fair, the warehouse has no shortage of those. But on the table in front of me lies an array of condoms and natural lubricants, a “love-language quiz,” a handout labelled “different forms of attraction,” and information about healthcare providers in Boston.
Maybe this, too, is self-love.

John Della Volpe is the Director of Polling at the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics whose research has focused on the public opinion of American youth since 2000. FM sat down with him to discuss the challenges that polling faces, its advantages for politicians, and the overall political sentiments of millennials today. This interview has been edited slightly for clarity and concision.
Fifteen Minutes: You’ve now been leading polling initiatives at the IOP for about 20 years. How have the environment and people at the IOP affected the work that you do?
John Della Volpe: I think the only reason that the poll is respected is because of the unique collaboration that I have as a polling director with students every single semester. My job is to elevate the voice of young people; my job is to tap into the ideas and the attitudes and the hypotheses that they have about political engagement and to measure to the extent to which they’re reflected in the broader population. Every year, there’s a new group of young pollsters who are adding energy and passion and curiosity, so we’re constantly updating and making the survey fresh. It’s always reflecting not just young people, but the unique cohort of young people who are coming of age politically, in real time, in front of us.
FM: When election results vary greatly from what polling suggested would happen, such as in the 2016 election, the validity and importance of polling can be questioned. When something like that happens, how can you assure the importance of polling? What steps should a pollster take to get more accurate results in the future?
JDV: The first thing is that national polling measures not the Electoral College, but the popular vote. So the polling averages across different kinds of data collection modes were incredibly accurate in 2016. However, clearly, there were important states in the Electoral College where the polling was off. And the industry conducted essentially an autopsy as a group to review data, understand why, and suggest improvements to modernize this process moving forward.
The second thing is that we need to recognize, especially in primaries, that it’s okay for people to change their mind. A poll that’s conducted on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday is not designed to be predictive of an event that hasn’t happened yet or that will happen five or six days from now. What we ask in the poll is, “If the election were held today, for whom would you vote?” So we’re not predicting what’s going to happen in the future. I’m confident that my colleagues throughout the industry understand the changes that are happening and have been making significant adjustments in order to make sure that the results that made people less confident about polling around the electoral college don’t happen again in 2020.
FM: People talk about the millennial vote and the generation overall as if it is one collective unit. From your experience, how homogeneous is the millennial vote really?
JDV: What’s important to understand is that age and generation are two of the most divisive demographic groups in America today. The opinions and attitudes of millennials and Gen Zers — and the way in which they vote — is significantly different from their parents and grandparents. The divide between gender, and in some cases, the divide between race and ethnicity, is more narrow than the divides between generations. So we talk a lot about America being divided 50/50, but a better way to think about it would be that if you’re under the age of 50, two-thirds of people vote one way, one third the other way. If you’re over the age of 50, it’s the opposite. So it’s really a two thirds, one third country, not a 50/50 country.
FM: How much of a role do you think that the youth vote will play in determining the winner of the 2020 election?
JDV: I think it’s going to play a critical role — it already has. There is virtually no way that Bernie Sanders would be the frontrunner, even if he’s a weakened frontrunner, if not for young people. So that’s already showing the role that young people are playing. Because of the strong level of support for Sanders, we’re having a conversation about Medicare for All and other elements of his agenda that we wouldn’t be having without the support over now four years among young people. So in that regard, it already has. The candidate who challenges Sanders or wins the nomination won’t have to win the entirety of the youth vote, but they have to be competitive. They have to be competitive. For a Democrat to win the Electoral College, he or she needs to win approximately 60 percent of the youth vote. Barack Obama did it twice. John Kerry and Hillary Clinton got 55 percent of that youth vote, and obviously we know what happened.
FM: Based on current polling, do you have a prediction for who will win the Democratic nomination?
JDV: No. And it’s not the job of polling to make predictions for something that’s many months away. We need to collect more data before we have any real understanding of the variables that are going to be at play. Having said that, I think younger people are reflective of the country as a whole, and that they truly seem torn between the Sanders approach to government and what you might call the Biden, Buttigieg, or Klobuchar approach to government. I think the party, as well as young people within the party, are still torn. The degree to which there’s clarity around those issues that very well may indicate who has an advantage heading into the summertime and the convention.

Under the golden light of chandeliers swaying above a room full of chatter, I was drowning. I gasped for phrases, characters, any sound to latch onto and send rolling off my tongue to appease the stern old Chinese lady before me.
Five pairs of eyes followed my gaze, which had been fixated on a plate of pasty white flat noodles for the past two minutes. Memories of my father ordering dim sum — asking for dishes loaded with fish, pork, shrimp, noodles, rice — replayed in my brain like a series of silent movie clips. In my memories, every word dissipated with the sweep of his arm.
A sharp “Ni yao shen me, ya?” cut through the air, quickly followed by, “What you want?”
As if a pair of floodgates had burst open with these three words, I saw my fingers point. The words, “This one, please” rushed from my lips, followed by an embarrassed smile. Soon enough, the conversation turned to admiring the noodles, now jiggling in a pool of soy sauce.
But my feelings of loss, denial, and frustration were unshakeable. Snip, snip, snip. Each cut of the scissors through the noodles effectively severed any connections I had hoped to make with the old lady through our shared cuisine, language, and culture.
As my chopsticks rolled over the noodles, a shaky “Xie, xie, a yi” — thank you, auntie — was all I could muster. The old lady pushed her rickety cart farther and farther away.
***
Every Chinese class started with 15-minute character writing quizzes. Acing these quizzes was often the product of late-night cramming the night before, and my memory of the characters was as short-lived as the quiz itself.
As the warm sunshine beckoned us outside, my fellow ten-year-old classmates and I squirmed, glued to our seats for reasons we could not and would not fully understand: Somehow, our parents believed, these classes were critical to growing up as Chinese-Americans, even though America was an English-speaking country. This fact was so critical that we would be in Chinese school for nine years.
When I finally walked out the doors of my Chinese school for the last time — diploma in hand, certifying that I had completed Chinese school satisfactorily through the AP Examination — I felt free. I callously exclaimed “I’m done with Chinese!” in front of my parents. At home, piles of Chinese textbooks, handouts, and study guides flew off my desk, relegated to storage space or simply thrown away. Saturday mornings melted into “the weekend” proper, marked by a breath of relief instead of a sprint to the car. I didn’t know then that I was sealing away my Chinese language skills indefinitely.
Because reading, writing, and speaking Chinese were no longer needed for passing exams or speaking in class, these skills peeled away to make room for the American part of me. At home, conversations at the dinner table shifted from pure Chinese to Chinglish to English, my parents encouraging me to speak only English even as they replied in Chinese.
After all, my parents explained, they had immigrated to the United States from China not only to pursue higher education in freedom, but to raise kids who would be American — who could speak, study, and make relationships in English. Our Chinese culture, then, could be celebrated in other ways — through festivals like Lunar New Year, cuisine, and more. All of this can be done without mastering Chinese.
With little reason to object at the time, I was content to drift through the rest of high school with the long Saturday morning classes in Chinese school behind me.
***
“Yeah! I’m taking BX” — the introductory Chinese class designed for heritage learners — “and it’s so fun! I can’t wait to apply to Harvard Beijing Academy this summer. I really hope I can go.”
During many conversations I have with Chinese-Americans at Harvard, they express some variation of this sentiment: taking Chinese for the pure joy of learning Chinese, rather than to pass an exam. As I watch my friends’ faces glow with happiness and excitement when talking about Chinese class, as I listen to them rave about Chinese pop songs, I feel the urge to log into my.Harvard, enroll in a class, and finally give learning Chinese the attention and love it deserves. I feel worlds away from identifying as Chinese-American, alienated by a language barrier growing ever more impenetrable from years of disuse.
This year, I realized that something beyond the character strokes tested on Chinese school dictation quizzes was missing. A piece of my core identity as a Chinese-American had broken away. How could I consider myself Chinese if I couldn’t absorb and process the culture myself when spending time with relatives, watching Chinese shows, or reading Chinese newspapers?
When I first got to college, I thought attending cultural events and introducing my friends to “authentic chinese food” were simple ways to rediscover my Chinese heritage without language skills. But this has only served to postpone defining a clear answer to the question — am I even Chinese-American?
Where do I fall, limited by words but bursting with passion and pride for my culture?
***
At the end of the day, all it takes is a knowing smile.
An old lady approaches our table with a cart full of steaming plates of pastries and soups fresh from the kitchen. The golden light casts a warm glow in the room, illuminating every fold of the potstickers and every garnish laid carefully on the side.
Phrases, characters, and sounds threaten to slip my mind. But instead of turning away, dipping my head, and letting my parents order the dishes, I grasp onto the words as they tumble out of my mouth.
She carefully lowers the xiao long bao onto the table, drizzling the dumpling vinegar sauce into a plate on the side. Her fingers hesitate over the scissors tucked into the pocket of her white apron, then flutter away — the soup dumplings are small enough to chew, and cutting them would spill the indulgent, rich juice inside.
As I pop a xiao long bao into my mouth, the “hao chi ya” — delicious — naturally escapes as a satisfied sigh.
There is no set of universal rules that apply to being Chinese-American — we each have our own definitions. I’m no longer taking formal Chinese classes with my peers, but by dropping a phrase here and slurping up a bowl of zha jiang mian — black bean noodles — there, I am still actively reaching out to my Chinese heritage, character by character. I must embrace the two forces as shifting in a state of changing equilibrium, encapsulating the meaty juice of history and culture with the light, chewy skin of language.
There is no recipe — only the chef’s guarantee that it will be delicious and filling, giving me an identity to build upon, fold by fold.

“Beast, beast, ready to act,” chants Krista — the character Shirley Chen ’22 is playing — under her breath before launching into a tumbling series of improv exercises in acting class. In “Beast, Beast” — a feature film produced by Alec Baldwin that premiered at Sundance in late January — Chen’s acting prowess allows her to capture the full force of Krista’s bubbling, layered personality.
A self-described “zany theater kid,” Chen was inspired to pursue theater at a young age after watching her older brother perform in plays and musicals. Soon, she was auditioning for commercials and shows. At age 13, she moved from Washington state to Los Angeles to pursue acting as more than just a hobby.
In high school, she landed her first breakout role as Molly, Peter Pan’s love interest in the play “Peter and the Starcatcher,” a prequel to “Peter Pan.” As Molly, Chen played “a romantic lead and the strong female protagonist” for the first time.
Her next major role came in 2018, when she played the eponymous character in the short film “Krista” — a performance that later won her the South by Southwest (SXSW) film festival’s award for “Best Acting in a Narrative Short.” “Krista,” written and directed by Danny Madden, explores the cathartic nature of acting when growing up in a world haunted by gender discrimination and sexual harassment.
After watching the short at SXSW, actor and producer Alec Baldwin signed on to produce a longer feature film, “Beast, Beast,” that expanded upon major themes from "Krista." Madden credits Chen’s powerful performance as a factor in the decision to create “Beast, Beast,” telling Deadline Hollywood in a January interview, “We became tight with Shirley, and she has more life and bubbliness — I felt that was something missing from the short.”
After premiering at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival on Jan. 25, “Beast, Beast” received acclaim for telling a raw, emotionally turbulent tragic story about three teenagers coming of age in contemporary America. This was her first professional leading role in a feature length film, and Chen was particularly excited to be presenting the film’s world premiere with Baldwin.
“My colleagues and I would pass by Steve Buscemi and Lin-Manuel Miranda, and [Baldwin] treated us the exact same way as he did them, with the most respect and charisma and willingness to share what he’s learned over the years,” Chen says.
Reflecting on her career thus far, she remembers often feeling underrepresented when auditioning for lead roles when she was younger — she was often one of two Asian-Americans waiting backstage.
Now, Chen no longer feels as if she can only audition for the token “type-A student or best friend.”
“The mentality has shifted completely, to believing that having an opportunity for any Asian person is also an opportunity for me. It’s about retraining yourself to think, ‘Okay, well, I inherently bring something unique because I am me,’” Chen says.
At Harvard, she has become a leader in the acting community, passionate about challenging herself through new experiences. Last year, she became the only freshman girl in the first co-ed Hasty Pudding cast. “I definitely went into it feeling like a fish out of the water, but getting to work with these girls who are very much respected on campus and who really felt so comfortable with musical theater really pushed me to try new things and grow,” Chen recalls.
During her time in college, Chen also joined the Harvard College Asian Students Art Project (ASAP), a group dedicated to celebrating the creative art skills of Pan-Asian and Asian-American students. She decided to join after watching ASAP’s production of the student-written musical “The East Side” last year.
“It was an amazing thing because it was the first time I’d ever seen an audience that was primarily Asian or Asian-American,” Chen says. “It was also in Farkas, which is the same space we do for the Hasty Pudding show, which is a very different kind of demographic and audience.”
Chen went on to co-direct ASAP’s production of “M. Butterfly” last fall — another new experience for her. “Ultimately, I would hope that I could help promote Asian-American arts, not only being in front at the stage or the screen but also behind the scenes more creatively,” Chen says.
Taking this mission to heart, Chen is on leave this semester to act in her first professional play, “Man of God,” as a member of an all-Asian cast. Talking about the audition process, Chen says, “Well, everyone [at the audition] looks like me. What makes me different now is not based on the superficial, but more so it’s about you and what you bring in.” She is excited to devote her full attention to the play without having to balance acting with a full course load.
Although Chen, for now, may be “riding it and seeing how it is” to be a professional actress full-time, she also looks back fondly on her busy first year here: “I think there’s nothing like going to Harvard, and there’s also nothing like trying your best to pursue your passion.”
Correction: February 23, 2020
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Chen co-directed a production of the opera "Madame Buttefly." In fact, she co-directed a production of "M. Butterfly," a show criticizing the portrayal of Asian identity in "Madame Butterfly."

A cacophony of AC/DC and clanging metal can be heard pouring out of the windows of Cabot House basement most afternoons. Down below, four mechanics are immersed in their work, tinkering with bike frames suspended in the air and tapping their feet to the music. The front desk is cluttered with business cards and stickers bearing the name of the shop: Quad Bikes.
The mechanics appear to be in their late twenties, dressed in denim and flannels. Bike tires and tools hang from the walls and ceiling in an ordered chaos that only the mechanics can decipher. They easily hold conversations with customers without stopping their work — it seems to come as second nature. Above the computer at the front desk, the Communist Manifesto is stapled to the wall, with a label below reading “Quad Bikes Training Manual.”
“We’re all kind of the manager. We’re anarchists here,” Neil L. McMullen, a mechanic entering his fifth year at the shop, explains.
Quad Bikes may not actually be a communist utopia, but it is a non-profit and “informal co-op” devoted to spreading the joy of cycling. The shop offers bike repair services to the Harvard and greater Cambridge community at affordable rates. Because it leases its space for free from the university, the shop can keep prices low, and without owners or shareholders, it survives by breaking even each year. Whatever profit Quad Bikes makes goes into buying more equipment and paying its employees.


Started in 2003 by Juan C. Agudelo ’03 and Timothy D. Ledlie ’02, two bike-enthused Harvard alumni, the shop’s original mission was to serve the students and faculty of Cabot House. Today, the mechanics strive to spread their love of bikes to as many people as possible.
“In a more abstract sense, we want to make cycling accessible to populations for whom it would not otherwise be feasible: students, homeless people, just people of our generation who are struggling to get by,” McMullen says.
In the back of the shop, tattered bikes wait for repair, tagged with their ailments. Each year in September, this room is filled with bikes that are practically unrideable — after the Phillips Brooks House Association’s Annual Bike Auction, students are sent to Quad Bikes to repair their new bounty.
Despite a complete lack of marketing, Quad Bikes has drawn a large following. “We’re thinking of making some sale flyers,” says Andrew L. Marfoli, another mechanic approaching his sixth year at the shop. “But we’ve always been able to make it work without doing that.” Above The Communist Manifesto, a coffee-stained poster hangs on the wall: “Best of Boston.” The shop didn’t need fliers to win the award from Boston Magazine last year — why make them now?
The award poster is barely visible through other repair notes, scraps, and memorabilia that decorate the entire space. The jumble of the wall reflects the eclectic character of the bike mechanics themselves. Each of them is deeply committed to cycling; they bike to work each day. Marfoli’s commute is 45 minutes: tough in wintertime, but he laughs it off as a minor inconvenience.
Quad Bikes has the following and alternative charm that might make itself into another gleaming campus attraction. But the warmth and personality of the store stands in unique contrast to the mainstream polished image of Harvard.
“We can’t really call ourselves external to capitalism, but we are anti-capitalists at heart,” McMullen says. “We try to exist as an antidote to that model.”

I can’t draw a nose. The nostrils, the bridge, the tip, that thing below it called the philtrum — they’re never rendered believably, always disjointed and unimpressive. And yet, I know it’s a nose, and you, my reader, would categorize it as one too. It looks unlike yours or mine, yet it is certifiably nasal. Lynda Barry, comics legend and recent MacArthur Genius Grant-recipient, often cites the dispiriting experience of drawing a nose and realizing it doesn’t really resemble one. This moment arrives for most, she says, around the age of eight or nine. Soon after, you quit drawing and move onto things you’re good at: soccer, reading, or playing with mud.
But comics, Barry insists, are different than drawing. “You wouldn’t want Charlie Brown or Bart Simpson with a hyperrealistic nose and hands. I mean, that would be kind of a horror comic, right?” she said in an NPR interview earlier this year. In Barry’s most recent drawing exercise book, “Making Comics,” she requests that you fight those childhood urges and try to draw once again. Many of us learn to draw around the same time that we learn to write. According to Barry, as kids, we process our worlds through our own constructed language that connects the two forms — written and visual — into one. Comics, then, should come easy — you grew up fluent in their language. You might be out of practice; you may despise the shapes you etch. But still, she says, draw comics. Let them be bad.
A comic is time laid out on a page. Traditionally, each panel holds a moment: The scene moves from left to right, and a story unfolds sequentially. In superhero comics, like “Archie” or “Tin Tin,” frames fit neatly beside one another; dialogue is stationed at the top of the panel; action is denoted by onomatopoeia jumping off the page. In short, comics are defined by rules: sequence, the presence of panels, cartoonish drawing.
The comics that I like best are those that kaleidoscope the form — distorting it, playing with it, and breaking it.
Take “Here” by Richard McGuire. Every two-page spread of this “graphic novel” depicts different scenes from the same geographic coordinates, which, for most of the 20th century, are occupied by a living room. Instead of putting frames side by side in sequence, McGuire lays them on top of one another. As you flip through the pages, you travel through the history of the space. In one spread, the main frame shows the living room in 1915; a smaller frame placed on top of it shows a girl sprawled across the carpet in 1970; another still shows a cat in the corner in 1999, licking her paw. “Here” moves through eons — from the minutiae of a familial spat to apocalyptic climate devastation in the same spot, centuries later.
And yet “Here” can be read over the course of an hour. Comics are different from novels or movies in this way: Details don’t demand to be noticed. As in a conversation, a gesture — a flippant smile or light exhale — may hold an entire plot point. If you don’t look closely enough, you might miss it.
Reading comics, then, is serious business. Or not. In the inner cover of his first book, “Jimmy Corrigan: the Smartest Kid on Earth,” Chris Ware provides a guide to reading comics, complete with a short exam for review. The exam asks readers if they are male. If yes, the next question reads:
2. As a child, you were
a. sort of happy.
b. not so happy.
c. miserable.
d. miserable and ugly.
e. miserable, ugly, and spit on.
This “exam” proceeds to ask if you read comics as a kid; if you identified with the superhero or the author; and if members of the opposite sex terrify you. Through this list of questions, Ware wryly paints the readers of his literary comics as nerdy straight guys who never attained the masculinity of their superhero-comic idols. He satirizes this dejected figure, particularly in his most recent book “Rusty Brown,” with a character named Chris Ware — an imagined version of his life, one in which he is a stoner art teacher at a midwestern high school. In the “Rusty Brown,” he pokes fun at “graphic novelists” who take themselves seriously, consider themselves highbrow, and yet just make comics — a historically “lowbrow” medium of pulp and fantasy.
The first comic book that I cared about fell between the two extremes: It was both pulpy and high art. “Ghost World,” the 1997 book by Daniel Clowes, tracks teen girl Enid Coleslaw and her best friend as they pursue (and sometimes torment) the weirdos of their boring suburban town. I loved how crass the girls were and how grotesque their neighbors looked. Clowes’s characters were misshapen and leering, as if he passed through the world with a magnified mirror that brought everyone’s pimples into focus. Reading, looking at “Ghost World,” I could see others as Clowes did.
The summer after my junior year of high school, I read a new kind of comic: “Building Stories” by Chris Ware. “Building Stories” might be categorized as just a book, but it isn’t — it’s a physical box. A box of pamphlets, papers, and posters, too heavy to carry in your backpack. Each object, meticulously composed by Ware, weaves together the stories of a one-legged woman, a bee named Branford, and a lonely building in Chicago.
The pages are laid out like maps, blueprints, and homages to “Peanuts” strips. No piece is meant to be read first, so I began with a massive newspaper-style work and laid it out on my bed. I leaned over it and in towards the tiny type; in my crouched position, I felt almost as though I was at work on the piece. Each day of that week, I woke up and sifted through the artifacts, scrutinizing them one-by-one. I waited with each frame for long moments, collecting bits of the story and constructing a chronology in my head. I was moved by the anxieties of an apartment building; I was peeved by a pretentious older boyfriend. While reading a wordless, silent strip about motherhood, I found myself weeping.

What separated the before from the after was an infection. Bacterial meningitis to be exact; an explosion of E. coli bacteria transported by arteries to the brain, inflaming his spinal cord and brain to the point of almost cutting off blood flow entirely, leaving neurosurgeon Eben Alexander III fighting for his life.
On Nov. 10, 2008, a Monday, Alexander went into a coma for a week, with essentially no brain activity.
Alexander claims he spent that time in heaven.
Heaven, at first, didn’t look so different from earth. Past the white light at the end of a tunnel, he saw a valley blushing with flowers, waterfalls tumbling into pools, revelers whirling arm in arm, and a girl flying on a giant butterfly. He says the chants of angel choirs made him aware of what he calls “the Core” — an “unending inky blackness filled to overflowing with the infinite healing power of the all-loving deity at the source.”
Thus began Alexander’s seven-day spiritual odyssey. On this journey, he says he traveled through different realms of heaven, learning the true nature of space, time, mass, energy, causality, meaning, and purpose.
A week later, he opened his eyes in a hospital room.
Alexander doesn’t dispute that his brain had almost no activity during his coma; actually, it’s one of the facts about his experience that he stresses most. He couldn’t have been hallucinating, because his brain wasn’t working. His apparent journey to the other side, he claims, is evidence that something about us — a soul, a consciousness, a spirit — is independent from our bodies: that we come from, and return to, the universe itself.
This idea stands in direct opposition to materialism, the philosophical doctrine that everything, including our consciousness, is generated by the physical world. Materialism is the basis of modern science as we know it. Alexander, though, believes the spirit exists separately from matter.
To Alexander, this conclusion is borne of logical reasoning, not of a disposition towards religiosity. He doesn’t ask his followers to believe in what he says regardless of scientific evidence; he asks them to believe because of it.
In Alexander’s telling, his near-death experience changed his life. At the time, he was the clinical director of the Brain Program at the Focused Ultrasound Surgery Foundation in Charlottesville, Virginia. Today, his professional trajectory bears little resemblance to the more traditional medical career path he was on then. He has authored several best-selling books, appears on daytime television, and hosts public speaking engagements across the globe, all with the intention of spreading his philosophy to the world.
But what separates Alexander from others with similar stories of the afterlife is his authority — by the time he had his near-death experience, he had been a neurosurgeon for more than 20 years, holding appointments at numerous prestigious medical schools, including Harvard.
Alexander is, for obvious reasons, a controversial figure in the medical world. Many professionals, perhaps most famously the late Oliver W. Sacks, have publicly disputed the medical claims in Alexander’s account of his near-death experience. They attribute many aspects of his experience to tricks the brain plays when it’s shutting down — for example, changes in blood pressure can produce what look like tunnels in one’s vision and bursts of neurotransmitters can create the impression of bright lights. Others worry that he is peddling snake oil to the sick, using his story to sell false hope to a vulnerable population.
But Alexander takes issue with the charge that encouraging the public to develop their spiritual lives makes him a quack. He envisions 1a type of medicine that is continuous with religion in its commitment to heal a patient’s full self — both their body and their spirit.
As a professor who spent more than a decade — 1988-2001 — teaching at Harvard Medical School, Alexander is an admirer of the former Harvard psychologist and philosopher William James, whose work at the American Society for Psychical Research applied the tools of empiricism to questions of spirituality.
In “The Will to Believe,” a lecture delivered to Harvard students in 1896, James described a distinction between what he deemed a “live hypothesis” and a “dead hypothesis.” A live hypothesis refers to an idea that one is capable of believing — an idea, in other words, that can spark an “electric connection” with one’s nature. A dead hypothesis, by contrast, cannot fit into a person’s understanding of the world.
For many, the claim that there exists an independent soul and afterlife is a dead hypothesis. But by redefining the spiritual in terms of science, Dr. Alexander is trying to resuscitate it.
Eben Alexander grew up in the sixties in North Carolina; he was adopted by a family that boasts a long line of distinguished physicians, all also named Eben Alexander. His father, Eben Alexander, Jr., was a neurosurgeon who graduated from Harvard Medical School, where Alexander himself would eventually become a professor.
Alexander received his undergraduate degree from The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1975, graduated from Duke University School of Medicine in 1980, and completed his neurosurgical residency at Duke University Medical Center in 1987. The following year, he took up a joint appointment teaching at Harvard Medical School and practicing at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.
“I absolutely adored my time at Harvard,” Alexander says. He rebuts the assumption that HMS culture was scornful of spirituality, arguing that it was “certainly an advanced enough institution” to permit free religious expression.
“I will confess that it was not something that was really part of our teaching,” he says. “If I were up there now, teaching residents and medical students, I would be more open-minded to the power of belief and the role of mind over matter, and the beautiful ways that we can truly manifest free will, in ways that I never was able to do back then, mainly due to my own limitations.”
He characterizes his religious beliefs during his time at Harvard as somewhat agnostic; though he attended church, he thought that “science was the absolute pathway to truth.”
But his doubt devolved into disbelief in 2000, when he tried to contact his birth family, whom he had never met. They didn’t want to speak to him.
He would find out years later that his birth family was still grieving the death of his biological younger sister, who had died two years earlier. They told him they didn’t have the capacity to meet a new child as they mourned another. Still, the rejection stung. In the following months, he stopped going to church and stopped praying with his children. “I kind of went through a dark night of the soul,” he says.
Alexander doesn’t mention it to us, but the following year, in 2001, he was also terminated from his position at Brigham and Women’s. In other interviews, he says that “medical politics” forced him to leave. Alexander was also sued for medical malpractice the year before he left by a patient who claimed he failed to inform her a surgery she underwent might result in facial paralysis — which it did.
Alexander moved on to UMass Memorial Medical Center, from which he resigned in 2003 after being suspended for alleged medical malpractice, the details of which have not been publicly disclosed.
In 2006, he began to work at Lynchburg General Hospital in Lynchburg, Virginia. While working there, he faced another malpractice suit in April 2008, this time for fusing the wrong vertebrae together in a patient. The plaintiff alleged Alexander noticed soon after his error that he’d made a mistake, but covered it up with a fraudulent operative report.
Alexander challenges that narrative, however, claiming that though he had indeed operated on the wrong vertebrae — a mistake he admits — his patient had displayed positive results, causing him to reevaluate the “surgical reasoning” that had led him to target the intended vertebrae in the first place. He asserts that he changed the surgical note to reflect this — not as an attempted coverup — and his patient only chose to pursue a lawsuit after he offered to cover the costs of follow-up surgery. Though he was required to pay a fine and attend a weekend continuing medical education course on recordkeeping, he says all the investigations that followed the incident eventually exonerated him.
Alexander brings to his defense a New England Journal of Medicine article that found neurosurgeons to be the medical speciality most at-risk for facing malpractice suits due to the treacherous situations with which they deal. “I have never been found guilty of malpractice, but I have settled several cases brought against me,” he writes in an emailed statement. “Settlements are made to avoid the steep costs of litigation, not as any admission of guilt.”
Still, when Dr. Alexander entered the coma that changed his life, he was being sued for nearly $3 million dollars.
Given the havoc the E. coli wreaked on his brain, it is a miracle that Alexander is alive and speaking right now. When he was initially hospitalized for his coma, his doctors gave him a ten percent chance of survival. As his coma stretched on, they changed that to two percent. When, against the odds, he woke up, his doctors were confident that his brain would never fully recover. Yet it did. He places the odds of this somewhere between one in ten million and one in a billion.
Doctors use the Glasgow Coma Scale to determine “the depth and duration of coma and impaired consciousness.” The scale ranges from three to 15, where three is death and 15 is completely awake. Nine or below is a coma.
During his coma, Alexander ranged between a five and a seven. In other words, he shouldn’t have had any experience in his coma at all. But according to him, that’s not what happened. When he recovered the ability, he wrote almost 20,000 words about his experience, which later became his first book, “Proof of Heaven.”
On the first day of his coma, he says he woke not in his hospital room, but “in a primitive, coarse, unresponsive realm” that had a “‘scorched-earth’ intensity” — one that stripped him of all language, knowledge, or memory.
He was delivered out of this desert by a “slowing, spinning, clear white light” into a glen he calls the “Gateway Valley.”
“The Gateway Valley was filled with many earth-like and spiritual features: vibrant and dynamic plant life, with flowers and buds blossoming richly and no signs of death or decay,” he writes.
“The chants and hymns thundering down from [the] angelic choirs provided yet another portal to higher realms, eventually ushering my awareness into the Core,” he continues.
After seven days in his coma, a boy, whom he later identified as his son, earnestly told him that he was needed back on earth, and he returned to the reality of his hospital room.
Dr. Alexander claims that he wrote all of this down as soon as he was able, with little pre-existing knowledge about other narratives of near-death experiences. He says that initially, he thought it had all been a hallucination, perhaps something superimposed by the mind as he returned to consciousness. In his own words, “I was my own worst skeptic.” It was only later, as he compared his experience to that of others that he noticed similarities. His secular worldview began to shift.
But one aspect of his vision eventually convinced him to embrace the spiritual: the girl on the butterfly, who had guided him through heaven. He says he recognized her, four months later, in a photo from his birth family; she was his deceased younger sister.
Alexander refutes any notion that he has been “chosen”. “Experiences are always tailored to teach the individual soul. And it just so happens that sometimes a lesson [for an individual] is a lesson that is also valuable for the world at large,” he says.
For almost a decade now, Alexander has been telling his story to a public audience. In 2012, he released his first book; he has since written two more, chronicling his experience in a coma and his outlook on life and death. He has appeared on “Fox and Friends”, Oprah, and Goop, among others.
He regularly gives talks to faith- and medical-based groups — often in popular vacation destinations, like Virginia Beach or the Bahamas. Currently, he runs workshops around the world, with titles like, “Becoming More Whole — Retreat in the Bahamas,” “Living in a Mindful Universe — Weekend Retreat,” and “Dying With Purpose: Consciously Crossing to the Other Side — Webinar.”
The “Becoming More Whole” event description, for example, promises patrons that they will harness “advanced brainwave entrainment technology produced by Sacred Acoustics to improve stress, anxiety, depression, addiction, and insomnia.”
Hearing Alexander speak, you might be surprised by his politics.
He inherited his light drawl, along with his name, from generations of Southern surgeons and scholars, and there seems to be an impulse to typecast Alexander as an evangelical conservative. His recount of his experience in the afterlife are similar to those of other evangelical Christians, and some of his media appearances echo conservative rhetoric as well — as an Esquire profile pointed out, he once appeared as a guest on Fox News to reassure viewers that the child victims of the Sandy Hook Massacre were being warmly welcomed in Heaven.
But Alexander’s belief system draws upon liberal politics in surprising ways. He supports transgender rights and individualized gender expression, an upshot of his belief that souls have no gender. He is appalled by our country’s class divide, and he is not an admirer of Donald Trump.
“I kind of chuckle when I think about what Trump has said in these last few days about Nancy Pelosi, who prays for him,” Alexander says, referring to the then still-ongoing impeachment trial. “He has no idea what that means. He doesn't understand that the power of praying for your enemy is really a tremendous power.”
In the same progressive spirit, Alexander asserts that the loving and creative source he encountered in Heaven — which he has named “Om” after the reverberating sound he heard in that realm — is too vast to be claimed by any one religion.
For Alexander, orthodoxy obscures meaning. There is no Hell, he says. Rather, souls experience — and learn from — the pain they have wrought in the lives of others through reincarnation. This model asks people to conduct themselves with a strong sense of justice, lest their deeds be answered back upon them.
Alexander’s theology also fits into a larger worldview. He believes we are now living at “rock bottom,” as disaster — in forms like climate change, income inequality, and increasing gun violence — looms. He also describes a pervasive sense of abandonment: the public abandoned by corporations, the middle class by the one percent, and people by their politicians.
Abandonment should resonate with no one better than Alexander, whose birth parents gave him up. To adopt his worldview is, in a way, to be adopted by his God — a forgiving, loving, and obliging parent, as described by Alexander.
So what’s stopping people from signing on? The problem of science, mostly. For many of the liberal-minded, the tenets of empiricism are incompatible with a god. Alexander, however, prophetizes the coming of a second scientific revolution — one in which spirituality will explode into the mainstream of progressive, empirical thought.
“By 2028, no self-respecting, scientifically minded, well-read person on earth will doubt the reality of the afterlife and reincarnation based on the scientific evidence,” he says.
For Alexander, the tool of revolution will be none other than the fledgling field of quantum mechanics — an elusive discipline about which the physicist Richard Feynman once quipped, “If someone tells you they understand quantum mechanics, then all you’ve learned is that you’ve met a liar.”
Alexander cites quantum entanglement, or what Einstein called “spooky action at a distance” — a phenomenon in which two particles separated by huge swaths of distance continue to influence each other — as evidence for the metaphysical realm in which consciousness ultimately resides.
Dr. Alexander isn’t the first person to have had a near-death experience; people have recorded similar instances since humans invented written language. Alexander takes this as further evidence for his theory.
However, many scientists believe the exact opposite — that the frequency and reproducibility of these experiences show that the brain is wired in ways that can trick us into believing that we are coming into contact with the supernatural.
In a 2012 article in The Atlantic, “Seeing God in the Third Millennium,” the late physician and author Oliver Sacks explains that the “bright light at the end of a tunnel,” almost universal in near-death experiences, is a “constriction of the visual fields due to compromised blood pressure in the eyes.” The light, meanwhile, is caused by “a flow of visual excitation from the brainstem… to the visual cortex.” He attributes the rest of Alexander’s experience to a standard hallucination.
Our perception of time, as Sacks points out, is not the same as the actual passage of time; Alexander’s experience, which he describes as being years long, could have easily taken place over the span of a few seconds — namely, when his neocortex (the part of the brain that produces hallucinations) was recovering function.
Alexander is aware of Sack’s skepticism, as well as that of his other detractors. “He didn’t even read the book,” he says. If Sacks had taken the time to read “Proof of Heaven” and his medical report, Alexander claims, Sacks would “tear up his original article and throw it out.”
But the criticisms of Sacks and others have not dissuaded Alexander’s followers, who fill conference halls and retreat centers to hear him speak.
For many, hearing someone like Alexander recount his transcendent experience is faith-sustaining and affirming. For those who are suffering — perhaps those grappling with life-shattering situations like terminal illness or the death of a loved one — accounts like Alexander’s are comforting.
Maybe there are simply some phases of life that aren’t adequately dealt with by scientific reality — regardless of what is actually true, there might be a place for alternative modes of belief inasmuch as they make the tragedies of life a little more bearable.
Some suggest that Dr. Alexander is motivated by profit.
Alexander strongly disputes these claims. He allows that he has benefited from the publication of his books; at the same time, he says that profit is an inevitable result of going with a mainstream publisher, which he had to use in order to effectively spread his message. He cites numerous free resources he has provided, from programs on his website to YouTube recordings of his lectures.
Alexander is hardly the only evangelist who has had a near-death experience; the internet is filled with them. Maybe they’re all cynical actors trying to get rich. Nevertheless, there are many others who believe the same thing happened to them, and have been much less public about it.
Perhaps profit is beside the point. Rather than investigating how Alexander’s story benefits him, it seems relevant to ask how it affects others.
The leading precept ingrained in medical school students is “do no harm.” Martin A. Samuels, a neurologist who once worked with Alexander at Brigham and Women’s hospital, applies this oath to the ethics of belief. “You can believe whatever you want, as long as you don't hurt people,” he says.
Tracy A. Balboni, an oncologist who helms Harvard Medical School’s Initiative on Health, Religion, and Spirituality, says that spirituality can be a source of comfort and solace for many of her patients. “In medicine in general, but definitely in cancer care, I think we’re faced with death and tragedy and suffering so often it’s hard not to wonder about that reality,” she says.
Balboni is well versed in western medicine’s rich “spiritual heritage” — albeit one largely obfuscated by an obsession with materialism. She explains that hospitals as we know them were “birthed” in monasteries, and notes that the ubiquitous symbol of medicine is the Rod of Asclepius, the God of medicine in classical antiquity.
And yet, she says that medical training is so focused on the technical aspects of care that some physicians might shut out patients’ spiritual needs or experiences. “I think there are definitely some that just feel like they can’t go there — like that’s not in their purview, and that they would be frankly uncomfortable,” she explains.
Balboni says that she recently lectured at a course offered jointly between HMS and the Divinity School, titled, “Spirituality and Healing in Medicine.” The class surveys how different religious traditions interface with the patient experience, and also teaches practical skills on how to take a patient’s spiritual history and provide pastoral care.
According to Balboni, the course’s student body also boasts a large contingent from the School of Public Health. She cites a number of studies — including Harvard’s Nurses’ Health Study — which suggest that community religious engagement promotes group flourishing.
Balboni mentions in our discussion on the continuity of spiritual and medical care that one of her patients, who had advanced metastatic cancer, gave her Alexander’s “Proof of Heaven” as a gift.
Balboni says that reading Alexander’s book struck in her patient the realization that he could choose whether or not to accept materialism, an idea which he had never thought to question. “There’s an assumption that there’s nothing more than what’s around us — the material world that we can see, touch, and feel,” she says. “It’s easy to forget that [materialism], in and of itself, is a form of belief and we can’t prove that that’s the case. We can’t prove that’s all we are.”
Perhaps the way to read Alexander’s book, then, is not as a doctrine, or a commandment, but rather as a “live hypothesis” — one that empowers the sick and the scared with a choice to believe that something exists for them in the beyond.
Shahram Khoshbin, a neurologist and Harvard professor in the medical humanities, expresses reservations about the utility of such stories. “Dogmatic religions,” he says, “can be pernicious. Medicine, and ethical decisions around treatment, are so complicated that there is little room for modes of belief that are not fact-based.”
However, that doesn’t mean that he thinks religion is useless. “I would be damned if I walked up to any person and took away their hope,” he says. “One of the things about religions that I adore as a physician is that allows for hope.”
According to Alexander, there is no better example of hope manifesting in medicine than the placebo effect — a phenomenon in which a patient’s condition improves simply because they believe in the power of a treatment, though it has no real therapeutic effect. Alexander also cites cases of spontaneous remission in patients with cancer, advanced infections, and congenital deformities.
“A patient believed that they could get better,” he says. “And so what we find in medicine is this reality that mind can have a tremendous influence over matter.”
Perhaps Alexander’s philosophy could function as a sort of placebo. What doctor — sworn to the Hippocratic Oath — would tell their vastly improved patient that they had taken only a sugar pill?
In “The Will To Believe” — the 1896 lecture in which William James made the distinction between “live” and “dead” hypotheses — James concludes with the following: “We stand on a mountain pass in the midst of whirling snow and blinding mist, through which we get glimpses now and then of paths which may be deceptive. We do not certainly know whether there is any right one. What must we do?”
He answers, “Act for the best, hope for the best, and take what comes… If death ends all, we cannot meet death better.”
And if Alexander is right, perhaps in meeting death, we also meet new life.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The City of Cambridge filed an emergency motion appealing a court ruling that lifted the city’s two-year moratorium on certain cannabis sales permits, according to a city announcement Friday.
Massachusetts Superior Court Judge Kathleen M. McCarthy ruled last month that a moratorium passed by the Cambridge City Council giving “economic empowerment” applicants a two-year window to be the only recreational marijuana sellers in the city was illegal.
Economic empowerment applicants are businesses that receive recreational marijuana licenses from the state via a program that aims to help groups disproportionately impacted by past drug policies.
Revolutionary Clinics — a recreational marijuana seller — filed a lawsuit seeking to overturn the ban in October. Keith W. Cooper ’83, the company’s CEO, claimed in an October affidavit that the moratorium would cost Revolutionary Clinics “upwards of $700,000 in profits per month at each of its Cambridge stores.”
In a response filed Wednesday afternoon, Revolutionary Clinics alleged the city’s appeal will “irreparably harm” the company’s interests.
“Cambridge now, on an emergency basis no less, seeks the ability to disregard this Court’s Decision and continue to enforce an illegal law for years while it pursues appeals before both the Single Justice and full panel of the Appeals Court, knowing that doing so would irreparably harm Plaintiff and undermine the public interest,” the filing reads.
As it awaits a ruling on the appeal, Cambridge will not agree to new contracts with recreational pot companies, according to the city’s statement.
Despite statewide efforts, the vast majority of recreational marijuana licenses have been given to business owners not part of the Massachusetts’s social equity program.
Western Front, an economic empowerment business that is replacing Central Kitchen in Central Square, is hoping to open its doors in the next five months. Western Front was co-founded by Dennis A. Benzan, the former vice-mayor of Cambridge.
Sumbul Siddiqui – who now serves as Cambridge’s mayor – told The Crimson in June that the moratorium is intended to give a “head start” to local businesses.
Massachusetts legalized recreational marijuana in 2016 via a ballot referendum. The Cambridge City Council passed legislation last fall that approved the sale of recreational marijuana in the city. City Councilors Quinton Zondervan and Siddiqui added the amendment providing a two-year exclusivity period for economic empowerment applicants.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Massachusetts Department of Transportation and Fiscal and Management Control Board held a meeting on Feb. 10 to update Allston residents and address public concern surrounding its ten-year infrastructure plan for the area.
The plan — known as the Allston Multimodal Project — will replace the Allston viaduct and straighten the Massachusetts Turnpike. It also includes plans to shrink the Allston interchange, improve multimodal connections, and create a new stop on the Worcester/Framingham Commuter Line called West Station.
The concept for the project originated in spring 2014 and has been developed by MassDOT and its design team, which is also working to file a final environmental impact statement for the plan.
MassDOT Communications Director Kristen E. Pennucci wrote in an emailed statement that construction should begin over the next several years and should last for approximately eight to ten years, according to MassDOT.
“Environmental filings for the project are targeted for completion in the end of 2021 with the goal of beginning construction in late 2022,” she wrote.
The update presented at the Feb. 10 meeting listed the track configuration at West Station, minimization of single track operations during construction, and environmental policy as “current areas of focus.”
Pennucci wrote that plans for West Station are currently under review as engineers determine which configuration will better accommodate transportation services.
“The project team is reassessing the 3-track station and a 4-track configuration to ensure that West Station is robust enough to accommodate the commuter rail services and urban transit service envisioned in the planning study,” she wrote.
The meeting’s agenda also included a report on the “major themes of agency and public comment.”
Local residents have raised concerns about adverse impacts the project may have on the community, particularly regarding congestion.
Anthony P. D’Isidoro, an Allston resident, said he hopes to see a mitigation plan in place to prevent excessive traffic and enable more efficient travel.
“We are gonna have a perfect storm of congestion as far as the eyes can see if we don’t take steps now to help minimize that,” D’Isidoro said.
Allston resident Harry E. Mattison said there needs to be a greater focus on transit as the project moves forward.
“I think there’s a really strong feeling that there needs to be much stronger reliance on transit for this project,” he said. “It will help people travel through Allston or to Allston while the highway is at a reduced capacity during construction.”
“There’s huge potential here, and so West Station needs to serve that potential,” he added.
Pennucci wrote that MassDOT is considering the public’s concerns as the team moves forward with the project.
“MassDOT takes seriously all public comment on projects and is currently reviewing the comments received since the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) scoping document was filed,” Pennucci wrote.

Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said he thinks Harvard’s new lottery system for General Education courses marks a “significant improvement” over the previous process in an interview Tuesday.
“It created confusion, stress, and was uncoordinated — that is, that people heard at different times about whether they got into one Gen Ed or not,” Khurana said of the previous system. “They couldn't make a fully informed decision, and that left a lot of uncertainty on their schedule and that impacted other classes.”
“Since Gen Ed is required, we thought it was really important to try to at least improve the system,” he added.
Under the new lottery system, students can rank up to five Gen Ed courses on their my.harvard online student portal. The Gen Ed office then uses a unified ranked-choice system to assign students to their highest possible preferences.
Khurana characterized the lottery’s launch as highly successful, pointing to the fact that roughly 87 percent of undergraduates participating in the lottery were granted either their first or second-ranked course choice this semester.
The Gen Ed office began working to create a new lottery system last summer with Harvard University Information Technology, the Advising Programs Office, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar’s Office, and the Office of Undergraduate Education. The initiative to revamp the system came after College administrators observed that some students successfully lotteried into multiple courses while others failed to lottery into any.
The new Gen Ed lottery complements a broadly refreshed Gen Ed program, which was unveiled in the fall of 2019 after a four-year-long overhaul.
The Gen Ed office caps its courses at a maximum of 250 students, though professors can choose to impose stricter enrollment caps if they wish. The office implements lotteries for courses if interest exceeds the cap.
Khurana said he sympathized with students who do not get seats in desired courses — Gen Ed and otherwise — because the College faces a perennial problem of overflowing classes.
“I still have enough of a memory of how frustrating it was as an undergraduate not to get a course with someone that you really liked, or wanted to take,” he said.
Still, Khurana said he thinks some professors must limit their course sizes to successfully engage a small group of students in more intensive discussion.
“I think we really respect the faculty's creative expertise and decisions on doing that,” he said. “One of the hallmarks of Harvard College education is that opportunity to take some of those smaller classes that allow you to have that interaction with your peers, as well as with faculty, in a kind of smaller setting.”
Khurana also suggested some potential methods to maintain face-to-face instruction while also meeting student interest, including adding more course sections, finding other instructors to take over for professors on sabbatical, and experimenting with classroom formats.
“Our goal is to allow students to take full advantage of the Harvard College curriculum,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Lawrence S. Bacow penned a letter on Jan. 27 to President Donald J. Trump about his concerns regarding the a possible expansion of the travel ban — a federal policy announced in early 2017 that restricted entry to the United States from several Muslim-majority countries.
Days after Bacow’s letter, Trump announced that another six countries — Kyrgyzstan, Eritrea, Sudan, Tanzania, Nigeria, and Myanmar — would be added to the travel ban starting February 22.
Since moving into Massachusetts Hall, Bacow has lobbied in the nation’s capital to bolster protections for immigrants, international scholars, and recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals and Temporary Protected Status programs.
DACA is an Obama-era program that allows some young undocumented people to live and work in the United States; TPS is a program that grants immigrants from certain countries protected status because they cannot return home due to circumstances like ongoing armed conflict and environmental disaster.
Bacow also wrote to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin K. McAleenan last July regarding his “deep concern” about the administration’s immigration policy.
Bacow wrote that the travel ban and the Trump administration’s immigration policies “sow fear” among Harvard affiliates.
“These restrictive travel and immigration policies sow fear in our community, disrupt scholarship, and deter international students from considering postsecondary education in the US,” Bacow wrote. “As the purview of these orders has expanded, students, faculty, and scholars from other countries worry that their immigration status could be revoked at any time — and with no consideration of their conduct or intent.”
The White House could not be reached for comment Wednesday.
The travel ban drew intense criticism after its announcement and faced challenges in multiple federal courts, leading to a legal battle in front of the Supreme Court. The Court ultimately upheld the ban in 2018.
In the letter, Bacow wrote that the bans have “prevented” or “hindered” universities from recruiting students, faculty, and scholars. He added that the bans have made collaboration with other universities more difficult.
Bacow wrote he supports and appreciates federal efforts to keep the nation secure, but believes the government should pursue alternatives to this particular policy.
“I believe we can respond to those challenges in a way that echoes the founding ideals of our country — countless people have looked to us for hope, for the chance to learn, to contribute, and to lead better and safer lives,” Bacow wrote. “My father and my mother were two of them, and they taught me that this country is great because its doors are open to the world.”
Before the announcement, the travel ban barred entry from seven countries to varying degrees. The updated travel ban will prohibit some types of immigrant visas — but not student visas — from the newly added countries.
Harvard has consistently lobbied for immigration-related proposals in both the House of Representatives and Senate. Since the start of 2019, Harvard’s Office of Federal Relations has worked on immigration reform issues, student visas, and issues pertaining to international students and scholars, according to the office’s disclosure under the Lobbying Disclosure Act.
“Immigration issues like OPT, DACA, TPS and the concerns of international students are a focus of the University’s federal activities with engagement with policy makers and key administration officials,” University spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote in an emailed statement.
Bacow closed his letter by encouraging the president to enact policies that would make America the “destination of choice” for top scholars across the globe.
“I hope you will do more to advocate for the United States as the destination of choice for the world’s best students, faculty, and scholars, regardless of nationality — and enact policies that make that possible,” he wrote.

At least three foreign foundations to which the Department of Education requested Harvard disclose financial ties have been publicly linked to the University in the past.
In a Feb. 11 letter, the Education Department asked the University to disclose information about contracts and gifts from the governments and citizens of China, Iran, Russia, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia. It also requested disclosures about gifts from the Alavi Foundation; Huawei Technologies; Kaspersky Lab; the Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development; the Skolkovo Foundation; and ZTE Corporation.
Christopher M. Hennessy, a spokesperson for the University, wrote in an email that Harvard accepts donations “in good faith.” Harvard retains full control over how funds will be used and prohibits direct donor involvement, according to Hennessy.
The Alavi Foundation — which former Iranian Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi founded in 1973 as the Pahlavi Foundation to promote the study of Persian and Islamic culture in the United States — lists a total of $606,500 in donations to Harvard between 1985 and 2014 on its website.
At least two such donations publicized on the foundation’s website were to Harvard’s Center for Middle Eastern Studies, with one earmarked to fund a tutoring program. The website also displays a copy of a 2009 letter from Steven C. Caton — a Harvard anthropology professor who at the time directed the Center for Middle Eastern Studies — to the Alavi Foundation, which credits the foundation with “subventing Dr. Ahmad Mahdavi-Damghani’s salary for the upcoming academic year.”
On its website, the Alavi Foundation emphasizes that it has “no affiliation with any government, let alone the government of Iran.”
The Foundation and Caton did not respond to requests for comment, and Mahdavi-Damghani could not be reached for comment.
The Qatar Foundation — founded in 1995 by then-emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani and his wife Sheikha Moza bint Nasser to “realize their ambitions for the future of Qatar” — and its subsidiaries appear to have had partnerships with multiple Harvard schools in the past decade.
Arabian Business Industries reported in 2012 that the Qatar Foundation joined forces with the Institute for Global Law and Policy at Harvard Law School to establish a graduate law school at Hamad Bin Khalifa University in Doha, Qatar. The Bilateral US-Arab Chamber of Commerce — a non-profit — reported in 2016 that the Qatar Foundation’s Education Development Institute had partnered with the Harvard Graduate School of Education to launch a leadership program specific to teaching and learning in Qatar Foundation Academies.
The website for bint Nasser, the current chairperson of Qatar Foundation, also lists a 2016 visit to Harvard’s Stem Cell Institute to “discuss ways of collaboration between the institute and Qatar's Biomedical Research Institute.” The 2015-2016 Annual Report of the Qatar Foundation also lists a partnership between the Biomedical Research Institute and Harvard Medical School, entitled “Cancer Biology and Therapeutics Program.”
The Moscow Times reported that Harvard Graduate School of Design Professor Mohsen Mostafavi designed the main research facility at the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology in 2012. Mostafavi, who served as the Dean of the Design School from 2008 to 2019, has also been listed as a member of multiple boards at the Skolkovo Foundation, including the Skolkovo Town Planning Board and the Urban Council Board.
The Skolkovo Foundation is a Russian-government-funded non-profit intended to bolster technological innovation and entrepreneurship in Russia.
Harvard Law School professor Roberto Unger also praised the Skolkovo Foundation in a 2013 video on their website. “I have studied the work of Skolkovo with enormous admiration,” he said in the video.
In 2012, The Telegraph also named “on-going Russian-US partnerships between the Foundation and NASA, Boston's MIT and Harvard University.”
Viktor Vekselberg — the Russian billionaire who chairs the Foundation’s board — facilitated the much-celebrated 2007 repatriation of the Russian Orthodox bells that once hung in Lowell House back to Russia. Vekselberg reportedly paid several millions of dollars to transport and replace the bells.
The Skolkovo Foundation, Mostafavi, and Unger did not respond to requests for comment.
Harvard has not yet been publicly linked to the telecommunications companies Huawei and ZTE Corp., which are both based in China, or to Kaspersky Lab, a Russian cybersecurity firm. The three firms did not respond to requests for comment.

Caroline B. Kennedy ’80 and Kenneth M. Duberstein have stepped down from their posts at the helm of the Institute of Politics’ Senior Advisory Committee.
Kennedy spent the past six years serving as honorary chair of the highest leadership body at the IOP — founded in memory of her father, former United States president John F. Kennedy. Duberstein, who served in senior positions in former United States president Ronald Reagan’s administration, has chaired the 17-member committee since 2013, when he succeeded Caroline Kennedy in that role.
In a Feb. 13 resignation letter obtained by The Crimson and addressed to Harvard Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf, Kennedy broadly explained her decision to step down from the committee.
“Over five decades, it has worked closely with the Dean and the Director in a relationship of mutual respect and constructive collaboration,” she wrote. “Recent developments have convinced me that I can no longer play a constructive role at the IOP.”
In her letter, Kennedy did not elaborate on those “recent developments.” She could not be reached for comment.
An article published in The Washington Post Wednesday afternoon suggested that disputes about the committee’s influence within the IOP led Kennedy to step away from the institute, which she had been involved with since her undergraduate years.
Several people familiar with the situation told The Post that Kennedy and Elmendorf had a tense relationship and that she and other members of the committee felt Elmendorf tried to assert too much control over the IOP. Some anonymous Harvard affiliates alleged that the tension between Kennedy and Elmendorf in part derived from the committee’s unsolicited involvement in IOP management.
The IOP’s website states that the advisory committee “works closely with the Institute to fulfill its mission to inspire Harvard students to pursue pathways in politics and public service,” though no specific duties are listed.
IOP Director Mark D. Gearan did not respond to multiple requests for comment Wednesday evening.
Kennedy School spokesperson James F. Smith declined to comment on The Post’s specific allegations. In an emailed statement Smith provided to The Crimson Wednesday evening, Elmendorf recognized Kennedy’s contributions to the institute.
“Caroline Kennedy is a distinguished public leader with an exemplary record of service to her country,” he wrote. “I am extremely grateful for the extraordinary dedication and commitment she has shown to Harvard Kennedy School over many years.”
Duberstein, who also recently resigned, had worked with the IOP for the past two decades, sitting on panels as well as participating in its bipartisan orientation for newly elected U.S. Representatives. He did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday evening.
Elmendorf commended Duberstein on his dedication to the institute.
“We greatly appreciate his absolute commitment to encouraging students to enter public life and for his tireless efforts to strengthen the IOP to support and inspire those students,” he wrote.
In her resignation letter, Kennedy reflected on her participation at the institute since her years at the College.
“When I enter HKS, I am reminded of my mother, my uncles and my brother, who all served on the SAC. I share their belief that inspiring the next generation of leaders to enter public service is the best way to honor my father's memory,” she wrote.

Theoretical physicist and Columbia University professor Brian R. Greene ’84 emphasized humanity’s unique place in the cosmos — despite occupying a miniscule sliver of space and time — at a Science Center talk Wednesday night.
In his presentation, organized by the Harvard Book Store, Greene gave the audience a preview of his new book "Until the End of Time: Mind, Matter, and Our Search for Meaning in an Evolving Universe." Greene said he hopes his readers can “recognize the wondrous, perhaps frightening to me, exciting fact that we occupy a little minute oasis in the cosmic unfolding.”
Greene began the talk by comparing the history of the universe to a year-long calendar, with the human race only coming into being at 11:40 p.m. on December 31. To describe the future of the cosmos, he used the analogy of the Empire State Building, with each floor representing a duration ten times that of the previous floor.
At the eleventh floor, one hundred billion years from now, the sun will grow over 200 times in size and possibly swallow the earth, according to Greene.
“By floor 38, we believe it’s likely that protons, the very heart of matter, will disintegrate, showing us once and for all that diamonds truly are not forever,” he added to laughter from the audience.
Even if humans still existed on the fiftieth floor, Greene explained, that the very act of thought would emit so much heat that they would effectively combust.
“If you think, you fry,” Greene said.
Greene also suggested that due to the rapid expansion of the universe, galaxies would move so far away that their light would never reach Earth. Astronomers in the distant future, Greene posited, might look into the night sky and see total darkness.
“To lose contact with distant galaxies is to lose contact with the very evidence for the structure of the universe as we currently understand it,” Greene said.
Harvard Book Store owner Jeffrey Mayersohn ’73 said he admired Greene’s energetic delivery, even as the presentation delved into abstract possibilities.
“It started off with the very concrete and went into incredible speculation,” Mayersohn said. “He took us along and we were with him every step of the way."
Greene refuted the possibility of humans having free will; thoughts and actions are simply interactions between elementary particles, which are bound to obey mathematical equations. Yet he said that a deterministic conception of the universe need not preclude hope.
“We are made of these exquisitely ordered, wonderfully choreographed particles of nature governed fully by the physical laws, no free will whatsoever,” Greene said. “And yet even in that environment, our particular arrangements can through a flitting burst of activity, create beauty, illuminate mystery, experience wonder.”
“The fact that particles can do that fills me with a sense of gratitude that really borders on reverence,” Greene added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign filed suit against Harvard in Massachusetts state court Wednesday over Harvard’s alleged investments in companies with ties to the prison industry.
The suit — first announced on Tuesday — names Harvard University and University President Lawrence S. Bacow; the Harvard Corporation and its Senior Fellow William F. Lee; and the Harvard Management Company as defendants, alleging they have violated Massachusetts law on two counts.
In their complaint, the plaintiffs allege Harvard has refused to investigate the scope of potential investments in the prison industry — representing a “violation of fiduciary duty and breach of the Harvard Charter.” In doing so, they argue, it has breached its state-mandated duty to “manage the endowment in ‘good faith and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise in a similar situation.’”
“By continuing to profit off the caging of people, Harvard violates its legal duty to consider the charitable purposes of its investments,” the complaint reads.
The complaint also alleges “untrue and misleading advertising.” The filing argues that, in order to paint itself “as a progressive institution” and attract donors and students, the University has allegedly “perpetuated misleading and false statements.”
“Harvard falsely advertises a willingness to research, engage, and act on redressing the harms that have come from its ties to slavery,” the complaint reads.
Among its statements of fact, the complaint lists a number of public statements that top Harvard officials have made on the subject of slavery. The plaintiffs allege Bacow “falsely claimed that Harvard had taken many steps in fulfilling its promise of addressing the legacy of slavery.”
“A boulder and a plaque do not address Harvard’s legacy of slavery,” the complaint read.
In the complaint, the plaintiffs asked the court to prohibit Harvard from investing in the “prison-industrial complex,” and to make “such practices” illegal.
Harvard spokesperson Jason A. Newton confirmed that the University received a copy of the complaint. In past statements, Harvard administrators have cited meetings between top administrators and prison divestment activists as evidence of a good faith effort to understand protesters' cause.
The graduate students listed as plaintiffs — Ismail A. Buffins, a student at the Divinity School; Amanda T. Chan and Anna L. Nathanson, students at the Law School; and Jarrett Drake and Citlalli Alvarez Almendariz, doctoral students in Anthropology — held a press conference at the Suffolk County Courthouse upon filing the lawsuit Wednesday morning.
The plaintiffs explained how their suit differed from a 2014 lawsuit that a group of seven Harvard student activists filed against Harvard; that lawsuit also alleged the University's investment in fossil fuels violated the school’s charter.
Chan said the 2014 suit was dismissed for lack of standing because the student plaintiffs did not have a “special position or enough of a stake in the endowment.”
“But today, we do not just stand here as students who are working in agitating for abolition and for divestment. We're standing here as donors to Harvard University,” Chan said. “So somewhere floating around in that $40.9 billion endowment is $20 of my hard-earned debt money, which means that under the charter, the University has to consider my will and has to consider its charitable purposes.”
The complaint itself notes that the Harvard Charter “requires accountability to donors surrounding the use of funds.” It also cites a ruling in a previous case in which a judge found that the individuals who contributed to a charitable organization had standing to sue.
Though noting that he donated $12.24 to the University, Drake said in remarks at the press conference that the notion of “moral standing” was more important to him than legal standing in pursuing the lawsuit.
“I'm a descendant of enslaved people in this country. My ancestors built courthouses like this. They built statehouses like the one on Beacon Street. They built universities like Harvard,” Drake said. “And as a descendant of enslaved people, it's impossible to see our system of mass imprisonment, and not see the relationships — the direct, direct relationships.”
“I'm here today, standing, literally, on the moral and the physical infrastructure that my ancestors, the ancestors of other people — enslaved people, exploited people — have built,” he added. “And that, to me, matters as much, if not more than, the legal standing.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Senior squash co-captain Gina Kennedy wakes up around 8 for breakfast at 8:30. She goes to class or does school work until 2:45 when she heads across the river for 3:30pm training. Then lifts from 5-6pm, showers and heads back across the river for dinner. More homework and sometimes social time post dinner.
On match days, the 2-time individual national champion’s schedule shifts slightly. Kennedy and her teammates go for a light morning workout and return to the courts in the late afternoon. The co-captain cheers on her teammates until around 20 minutes before her match when she breaks away from the spectators to prepare mentally and physically.
Growing up, Kennedy played mostly by herself. Clinching five British National Championships, a U19 European Championship, and achieving the number one in England ranking in the U13, 15, 17, 19 age categories was largely an individual pursuit. Her success in the junior circuit was accompanied with immense anxiety. “I felt so much pressure, I was just desperate to win,” said the Beckenham, England native. “When I played for myself, and I lost, there was no repercussions for anyone. It was just me.”
Now at Harvard, Kennedy has adjusted to becoming a teammate. When Kennedy steps on the court wearing Harvard colors she is thinking of her team. “The goal is different at Harvard, they’ve made this individual sport into a team sport. I’m thinking in terms of how many matches the team has won, what I need to do to contribute to a team win.”
Kennedy’s thinking mirrors that of Coach Michael Way. The James Herscot '58 Coach of Excellence is in his 10th year of coaching at Harvard. Way emphasizes the importance of a program that prioritizes character development and a mindset of constant contribution.  “Everybody contributes. When we think of the word synergy, that is absolutely what it is... something greater than the sum of its parts.”
“Being neutral is absolutely not ok. Some student athletes think, especially in an individual sport, that they can be neutral because at the end of the day, in their mind, it only affects them. But of course that’s not true.”
Coach Way and Kennedy both cited Monday’s “challenge matches” as an example of the program’s commitment to resilience, respect, and team-oriented thinking.
Challenge matches stem from collegiate squash’s “ladder” organization, a system that explicitly ranks players’ ability as compared to one another. In competition, team’s individual seeds play one another and the cumulative number of match wins determines the victor.
Importantly, the ladder is dynamic. On Harvard Squash, the possibility of adjustment comes every Monday when the line up is challenged- number one playing number two, number three playing number four, and so on.
Although the matches themselves are often incredibly stressful, Kennedy and Coach Way comment on the meaningfulness of players' behavior post-match. “It’s really to do with how they deal, character and maturity wise, post match. It has to do with ego suppression on one side of it, being supportive and helpful on both sides, but especially the victor,” responds Way.
Kennedy similarly describes Monday practices as essential in building team culture.
As opposed to the weekend contests against rival schools, playing against teammates represents its own set of stressors. Simultaneously though, challenge matches create a space for the team to grow stronger as a unit. “Normally, after a match you just kind of go off and do your own thing.  It’s different playing teammates. On Mondays we have lift at five o’clock straight after. If you win or lose, you go partner up with the person you’ve just been on the court with.”
Way comments that not all teams embrace the potential conflict of challenge matches so readily. “The stress of these situations is so high, many teams avoid challenge matches.” He disapproves of this messaging, understanding his role as a coach to guide student-athletes through stress, not teach them to avoid it. “We call it stress with answers.”
The coaches and upper classmen embrace a “get over it” philosophy, buying into a team culture that requires athletes to put their ego aside. “They learn how to navigate being a friend, being a teammate, and still being able to compete at the highest level possible to beat their opponent,” says Way.
In her senior year, Kennedy reflects on her motivations for playing squash.  “I was nine years old when I started, I genuinely do love it. Training day in and day out, it’s obviously a sacrifice but that’s what I want to be doing. I want to be training.”
Post-graduation, Kennedy will move back to London to train full time as a professional player. She’ll travel around the world playing in tournaments trying to elevate her ranking.
Pursuing a professional career will come with it’s own set of stressors. Competing for prize money and sponsorships attaches a new level of pressure to Kennedy’s individual performance.
But Kennedy feels confident her time at Harvard with Coach Way has prepared her for the challenge. “Being a part of Harvard Squash has taught me how to be more mentally tough. Our coach does a lot of mental work with us and this is definitely going to help me when I enter my pro career.”
After winning their fifth straight Ivy League Championship, the No.1 ranked, undefeated Harvard Women’s squash heads into the National Championships February 21st. The individual championships will follow on March 6th where Gina Kennedy will compete for her third National Championship win.

Even though you promised yourself you would “be more productive” this semester, it’s now 3 a.m. and you still haven’t finished that GenEd paper (why are they assigning them so early in the semester anyway?). In case you still can’t bring yourself to do work, Flyby has got your back when it comes to convincing yourself you’re being productive while still procrastinating.
Clean Your Room/Do Laundry
This one is a classic. Bust out your vacuum, throw on your favorite playlist, and get cleaning. After you’ve finished cleaning your floors, convince yourself that organizing your desk will ~organize your mind~ and spend two hours throwing away (or burning) old syllabi and psets. Let the feng shui wash over you as you blissfully ignore that essay.
Go Get Some Coffee
Sometimes all you need is a smooth shot of espresso to help you get your work done. Grab your HUID and head to a BoardPlus location for a quick pick-me-up to motivate yourself to finish that last paragraph. Javiva is a favorite of Flyby.
Do Other Homework
If you just don’t want to do your math p-set, never fear! You have plenty of other work to occupy your time with. Get started on that history reading due in three days and soon enough, you’ll have finished all of your other assignments while still procrastinating on the one that’s actually due tomorrow.
Watch a TED Talk
Instead of brainless Tasty videos, check out the TED YouTube channel. It’s full of fascinating, “Grey’s Anatomy”–length lectures on all topics from global security to biofabrication to – you guessed it – procrastination. Instant gratification monkey, anyone? TED Talks are the perfect way to avoid your pre-lecture quizzes while also learning something new and interesting without having to take another GenEd.
Plan Out Your Week
Break out your stationary and start planning out your week. Whether it’s in a bullet journal or on an index card, outlining your tasks and meetings for your week is a surefire way to feel accomplished while simultaneously stressing yourself out with the amount of work you keep putting off.
When work is piling up and you can’t bring yourself to attack it, these are helpful ways to take a break while convincing yourself that you are indeed an ~academic~. And if you need any other ideas, you can always write a Flyby article about procrastinating. We can confirm that this is working incredibly well…
