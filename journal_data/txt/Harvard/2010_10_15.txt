After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We’ve all seen the victims of problem set night. Groggy, bleary-eyed kids, still wearing the sweat pants they slept in, downing full glasses of orange juice in the dining hall before stumbling off to class. If they make it there on time, it’s usually to toss some stapled, hand-written sheets, pockmarked with cross-outs and erasures, onto the problem set pile before slumping asleep in the back row.
Late-night problem sets, which often drag on until the early morning, take their toll on math and science students across the country, not just at Harvard. Interminable problem sets frustrate students, deprive them of sleep, and take their toll on a student’s self-esteem. That frustration may be driving students to other concentrations: Past studies have shown that up to two-thirds of students who enter Harvard hoping to concentrate in science end up switching majors.
The typical advice given to students with problem set woes is to start earlier. In the 1980s, when the terminals in the Science Center would run much faster with fewer users, students deliberately waited until after 10 p.m. to start working. Could it be that the pattern of working on a problem set only late at night is a vestigial remnant, carried over from the early days of computers?
A better explanation for why students start late is that problem sets in most advanced science and math courses are so tough that they require collaboration, and the only time when busy students can find time to work together in large groups is late at night. In addition, problem sets often require applying material that is only taught in the class before it is due, which makes it a waste of time to start early.
Short of making problem sets shorter or easier, there are many ways professors can make problem set nights  less onerous. One pressing issue is that students underestimate how long problem sets will take, making it difficult for the organized ones to convince their classmates to start working with them before it’s too late.
Many professors provide a limited number of times that students can turn in a late problem set with no penalty. Although helpful in theory, taking a late day only drags out the process, and it frequently cuts into time that students had set aside for their other coursework.
It would be more helpful if students could be given an accurate sense of how many hours they should set aside for a given problem set beforehand. Many professors already poll students about how long they spend on the homework. Asking them to additionally answer how long they spent on each problem of the set would give them good estimates for future assignments.
Another quandary is that, intentionally or not, many classes will assign homework problems on subjects not covered by lecture. Harvard professors are undeniably brilliant and often very good teachers, but it can be difficult for them to know which topics need to be covered in order for their students to finish the problem set. Part of the problem comes from the fact that, at Harvard, there is bound to be at least one student per class who is so good at the material that he or she doesn’t need to be taught how to solve a particular problem. The professor may never learn which of their problems are too tough for most people to solve, as the other students quickly learn to seek out that one genius who can help them get through it.
One simple remedy might be to list the readings relevant to a particular problem. Knowing where to look to find the relevant problem solving technique would at least save students the time spent searching through unrelated chapters with a fine-toothed comb. Better yet, it would allow them to do more work on their own without seeking expert advice. It would also force the professor to only assign problems that students could reasonably be expected to complete given the materials available.
Physics 16, an honors introductory class for freshmen, offers an effective solution to many problem set woes in that the professor will sit with the students in Leverett dining hall the night before the problems are due, answering questions until the wee hours of the morning. With the professor on hand to clarify any misconceptions or confusion in the wording of prompts, students don’t waste time arguing over semantics or pouring over their textbooks looking for examples. However, the professor, Howard M. Georgi ’68, is the master of Leverett House. Most other professors—who live off campus—can’t realistically be expected to stay up until 2 a.m. in a dining hall with their students.
Interminable problem sets can be a science concentrator’s greatest frustration at Harvard. However, with a little more communication about length and topic, problem sets can be made much less painful and much better learning experiences overall.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After the faculty and president of Harvard College announced last week that, once again, restrictive policies will prevail during the “festivities” surrounding the Harvard-Yale Game, we were hardly surprised. Unlike the arctic-temperatured event two years ago, though, we have a plan to make this Harvard-Yale as much fun as possible. With no keg stands—actually, no kegs, period—no U-Haul trucks, no tailgating past noon, no hard alcohol, and no excessive cheering, laughing, smiling, nor evidence of fun-having whatsoever, Harvard just doesn’t know how to throw a party. Instead of binge-drinking alone in our Houses, we should keep the pre-game where it belongs: New Haven.
We advise our fellow students to pack up their belongings, as they did last year, and proceed to Yale the night before the big game. We’ll all crash on the floor of that dude we sort of used to know from high school Spanish (no need to give him warning, because everyone loves a surprise), then stand in those unbelievably long lines the next morning, board a shuttle to that sports field 15 miles from campus, and proceed to get pumped. Honestly, there’s nothing better. The stadium will be empty, but that’s not really a change from last year, either.
In preparation for our imminent arrival, we hope Yale pulls out all the stops. Maybe a SWAT-themed club party is in order? (We’ll bring the Tasers.) After all, New Haven’s nightlife could use a financial boost, and Harvard does pride itself on our commitment to public service. Revitalizing the neighborhood via the hundreds of Four Lokos we will buy is the least we can do.
Just like last year, we expect that the tailgate will continue into the third quarter of the Game. “What game?” you may drunkenly ask aloud around 3 p.m. in the midst of all the hoopla and the barking of Handsome Jon, or Drew, or whatever its name is. Our point exactly. Ideally, upon arrival back at Harvard, we’ll be intoxicated and have missed the Game entirely—the way our forefathers intended it to be.
Anyway, we know who’s going to win. Who really needs to see it again?

My own freshman crew experience ended on the superbly sunny morning of Harvard-Yale. One of those rare days of good weather that appear as November dies. The clouds were still and the water was still, even past the MIT boathouse where the river opens and where earlier in the season we maneuvered for passage against the various Boston sailing teams.
Of late, practices had been cold and wet. They were hours of sitting in inches of slush and slick muck. On return trips, the only thing I could see were the winking lights attached to Weeks, and the dome of the Business School’s Baker Library faintly aglow. I was expected to guide 1,500 pounds of male through this darkness and land it on a 10-yard strip of driftwood with a pulley system that belonged in the Crusades. It seemed many a night that all the injustice in the world was conspiring against me.
Crashing into the B.U. Bridge at Tail of the Charles was then, in some ways, a relief. I’d had doubts for a long time. Clearly, trying to learn how to drive a boat before learning how to drive a car was a mistake.
I had joined the crew team in September of that fall after hearing about it from a friend who later took up club soccer. I knew nothing about sports, less about rowing. I pronounced every syllable of “coxswain.” But they promised to teach me; they were desperate. They’d been rotating one of the lightweight guys into cox, and so one day I went out on the launch and the next I was a Harvard athlete.
It took me very nearly until the end to realize I’d entered a tradition.
After all, walking onto—and dropping out of—the crew team, is practically a rite of passage. The lightweights start with 80 novices, the heavyweights with 30. By junior year, the ranks have thinned to five or six. I was interviewing a guy over in Wigglesworth Hall a couple days ago, and halfway through, he got up, apologized, and said that he had to go to practice. It was a most unjustifiably random time of the afternoon and just from that, I knew it had to be crew. It’s a program notorious for chewing runners, swimmers, and quarterbacks up and spitting them out. But those who stick it through testify unanimously to a unique and formative experience. Hell, I didn’t stick it through, and I can testify to that.
What is it about rowing that is so affecting—and so appealing?
Is it the beauty of the Charles River, bending magisterially? Or the intense camaraderie within a group of eight people with whom you synchronize four miniscule movements—catch, drive, finish, recovery—for whole deciles of your life? I’ve been cited many justifications for crew’s popularity. It guarantees a daily two-hour workout supervised by world-class trainers and spurred on by 20 other guys. It is classy and surprisingly cerebral. And unlike most other sports, crew goes out of its way to advertise itself among those who have never rowed before. In recent years, coaches have stepped up recruiting, but it used to be that, especially with the lightweights, walk-ons filled boats. At the beginning of the season, freshman coaches Blocker and Bill Manning always recall those novices who moved up, even past recruits, into the 1V. “If you’re good enough,” they say, and who can resist that challenge?
These are all good reasons. But they are not all the reasons.
There is no other sport that so utterly defines this school. When you think crew, you think Harvard, and rightly so. It is not only a matter of record, although ours is an outstanding one; as in all endeavors, powerhouses appear in the most unexpected of places, the University of Wisconsin, for example, or Stanford, whose boathouse is literally in a different city. It is a sport of privilege—a shell can cost upwards of $40,000 dollars, each oar $800—but so are lacrosse, polo, sailing, field hockey, and squash. Yet none of them carries the same cache or the same touch of exceptionalism.
Harvard the university is polymorphous and chameleonic. I can’t name with any authority the labs, classes, or professors that constitute its crux. But I think more than anything else, more than final clubs and more than the Harvard Lampoon, crew encapsulates what it means to be at Harvard the institution, Harvard the name, Harvard of our childhood dreaming. Unabashedly elitist yet a meritocracy. Hierarchical yet equal opportunity. A team sport that emphasizes above all, individual skill and effort, and its corollaries, competition and ranking. Every Friday, the top 5k erg and stadium times are posted with pregnant pride in the heavyweight locker rooms. Crew not only breeds winners on the water, but it also breeds winners at life.
If these qualities sound intimately familiar, it’s because they are Harvard’s qualities.
And that’s why, year after year, legions of young men (and a few young women) flock down to Newell for a week, a month, or maybe the rest of their college careers. Through the double doors, past the four hangars of sleek, narrow boats, to the sloping dock, where an eight is just pushing off with Joycean grace, “faintly as tolls the evening chimes, our voices keep tune and our oars keep time.”

The figures of failure are stark: 10 years of war, thousands dead, a broken country further battered by billions of dollars worth of weapons as a result of the war in Afghanistan. The successes construct another narrative: fleeting signs of a democracy, a heightened emphasis on human rights and equality, and the undermining of the forces that destroyed the Twin Towers and took shelter with the former Afghan leadership. So, while any sign that the war in Afghanistan may end is an uplifting one, our emerging relationship with Taliban is one we should view skeptically.
Afghanistan has always been a wild place, with the kind of terrain and diversity that impedes easy military victories. Since the time of Alexander the Great, invasion of the country has often proved remarkably difficult for Arabs, Brits, Soviets, and other invaders. Thus, some may feel that the United States should take advantage of any chance to exit the country, even if it means compromising with the Taliban. In fact, many of our allies in the region, including the corrupt government of Afghanistan (led by Hamid Karzai) and Pakistan (where members of the renegade Inter-Services Intelligence actively support the insurgency) are urging a diplomatic approach to the totalitarian Taliban.
While this diplomacy is still its early stages, the strategy is problematic for a variety of reasons. First, it raises questions about the very purpose of this war. The stated goals of capturing Osama bin Laden and eliminating the group that sheltered Al-Qaeda are both in jeopardy. Hurriedly ending the war without capturing bin Laden or eradicating the Taliban would throw the justifications for this war into question.
Additionally, before granting concessions to the Taliban, we should remember that theirs is a radical movement capable of incredible oppression and violence. The Taliban has not proven friendly to democracy and thus threatens any progress on efforts to promote liberal democratic leadership and values abroad. The Taliban operates under the essentialist belief that its brand of Islam is the only right one. Given this, the Taliban is not likely to compromise, and the fanatical views of its members threaten the freedom and safety of any who dissent.
Afghan history should also teach us another lesson: Hastily withdrawing troops can have very devastating consequences. The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics did this in 1989 after 10 years of war, and the results were catastrophic. Civil war between government forces and the Pakistan-backed Hezb-e Islami consumed the country, leading to the eventual rise of the Taliban. This history should be close to the American conscience, because America played a role in the withdrawal by sponsoring the anti-Soviet mujahideen—who among its members included future leaders and supporters of Al-Qaeda and the Taliban. Leaving an unstable Afghanistan to the mercy of conflicting factions cannot end well.
Unfortunately, our choices in Afghanistan are limited. The easy way out is to cobble together some faulty resolution and scramble from a country we helped ruin, thus continuing a tradition that has been recent Afghan history. The more difficult path is to intensify the resources that are being contributed to winning this war, to send an adequate number of troops and materials to protect and rebuild the country, and to pressure Pakistan to end its support of our enemies. The war in Afghanistan is a necessary war against the fanaticism that has broken our world in the past and will do so again if we do not see it through to some reasonable standard of victory.

China may be a leader in the global economy, but it stands to make significant improvements in the realm of human rights. The recent awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to dissident Liu Xiaobo is a sharp reminder of the struggle for greater rights and liberties that still exists in China.
We commend the Nobel Peace Prize Committee for taking a brave, well-directed stance in awarding the 2010 Peace Prize to Liu, the imprisoned Chinese political rights activist currently serving an 11-year jail sentence. Naming Liu the recipient of this prestigious award for his “long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in China” is an important step in recognizing the persistent call for political reform in China. Moreover, it is an encouraging sign for other democratic activists that their ideas can indeed resonate, even from jail.
Liu was jailed in 2008 after co-authoring Charter 08, the “central document of the Chinese human-rights movement,” which calls for greater democratic reform in China. Prior to writing Charter 08, Liu was jailed for participating in the 1989   Tiananmen Square protests and was sent to labor camp for three years in the 1990s. After fighting on the behalf of human rights and liberties in China for more than two decades, it is appropriate and admirable that Liu’s efforts are finally being recognized on an international level.
Various western countries around the world applauded the Committee’s decision and called for Liu’s release; nonetheless, these governments should be doing more to speak out against China for curtailing many human rights and freedoms. It is understandable that Western policymakers fear ruining trade relations with China—many refrain from criticizing China for fear of economic retaliation—but they should not hesitate to condemn China’s actions. After all, China needs the West just as much as the West needs China when it comes to economic matters.
Because many governments fail to consistently speak out against China’s authoritarian laws, it fell to the Nobel Peace Prize Committee to send a strong message of rebuke by awarding Liu the prize. The Chinese government has indicated that awarding the prize to an individual considered a criminal by the Chinese judicial system could adversely affect diplomatic relations with Norway, where the Committee is based. However, the Committee is not officially affiliated with the Norwegian state: As an independent body, the Committee is then in a unique position to recognize Liu’s contribution to human rights where official governments often fall short.
We hope the awarding of the prize can ultimately positively affect China. The government should temper its reaction and instead see this as an opportunity to consider calls for greater democratic reform. Moreover, we hope the Chinese government will consider releasing Liu from prison and giving him and government officials the opportunity to voice their opinions freely in an open forum.
The Nobel Prize Committee made a significant first step in awarding Liu this prestigious award. With the urging of Western countries, China must now listen to activists and seriously work toward creating a freer society for all Chinese citizens.

It may only be October, but U-Hall is already e-mailing us about our J-Term plans. The UC will fund student-initiated events during J-Term’s last week, but they have to be on-campus. For those looking for a little more (Harvard-funded) excitement this winter break, here are FM’s 15 recommended J-Term proposals.
1. Get funding from the physics department to study gravity disparity between the Eastern and Western Hemispheres by skydiving in Peru and New Zealand. Galileo did his thing 400 years ago, somebody’s got to update that data.
2. Help the VES department stay up to date with their technology by analyzing the effectiveness of their cameras in dark nightclubs.
3. Go to Italy and flirt with Italians. It’s romance studies.
4. Get a grant from the classics department to buy enough popcorn to rewatch “Back to the Future,” “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off,” and anything starring Molly Ringwald.
5. Apply to the Sanskrit and Indian studies department to fund your yoga classes, and the obligatory tikka masala you need to refuel your chakras.
6. Take a picture of yourself supporting the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Tell the history of art and architecture department that you’ve “situated yourself in dialogue with the work.”
7. Learn guitar.
8. Take your “Science and Cooking” research to the next level by comparing the chemical makeup of German beer with Japanese sake.
9.  Analyze medieval dance culture by asking the medieval studies department to buy you a suit of armor. Then get jiggy with it.
10. Take the chemical half-life of the peanut butter sandwich you left in your fridge in October. Chemistry?
11. The School of Public Health will probably sponsor your trip to Laos if you promise to send home stool samples.
12. Make the astronomy department send you to Space Camp. Remind them that failure is not an option.
13. Ask the oceanography department to fund your scuba diving lessons in Lake Como.
14. Deconstruct your Hungarian bar receipt as a hist and lit text.
15. Travel around the country recording sordid tales from Harvard students’ sex lives. Send the bill to folk & myth.

Romeo and Juliet, Theseus and Hippolyta, Portia and Bassanio—Ben and Katy Woodring can now be counted among the list of couples united under Shakespeare’s auspices. Benjamin M. Woodring and Catherine L. Reedy are both teaching fellows for English 124d: “Shakespearean Tragedy,” taught by Professor Stephen J. Greenblatt. Last weekend, in Wilmette, Ill., the couple got married. “Magical, I think, is the best word,” said Woodring to describe the ceremony.
But the magic really started two years ago, a day after spring break in 2008. Woodring was told that he needed to give a tour of Harvard’s campus to a student just accepted into the graduate program in English. “I assumed it was just going to be another so-so, work-a-day tour,” he said.
After Reedy’s flight landed, she showed up at the Barker Center. “I’m sort of shy when I meet new people, so I just nervously waited outside the door, pacing back and forth for about an hour,” she said.
When Woodring finally emerged, she approached him and introduced herself. “I felt refreshed and comforted by her beauty,” Woodring said. “Within five minutes, it felt like we had known each other forever.” Woodring took Reedy out to lunch, a meal that quickly turned into a five-hour date, during which they “talked about everything.”
For these two, all this talk wasn’t much ado about nothing. The couple kept in touch all summer and started dating when Reedy arrived on campus in the fall.
“In the year before they got engaged, they probably spent more time together than a normal couple does in three or four years,” said Peter M. Wright, a friend of the couple. After their one-year courtship, Woodring and Reedy got engaged in November 2009, while on a trip to New York City to see “Turandot,” a marriage and love-themed opera. On that “misty, surreal” evening, Woodring popped the question.
When asked what role Shakespeare plays in their relationship, Woodring responded, “Shakespeare is almost universally emotionally resonating. His works are central to our relationship, and to how we understand each other and the world.”

David L. Ager, lecturer of the hugely popular Sociology 109: “Leadership and Organizations” and the Director of Undergraduate Studies in Sociology, is known for his sky-high CUE ratings, affable personality, and enthusiastic teaching style. The Canadian and former Harvard Ph.D. student in Organizational Behavior spoke to FM about his life, his passion, and “The Social Network.”
1. Fifteen Minutes: How does it feel to be teaching a mega-popular class?
David L. Ager: It’s very overwhelming, and at the same time very gratifying. It’s fun to know that you’re teaching a topic and teaching in a way that resonates with students.
2. FM: Why do you think your class has such an appeal for Harvard students?
DLA: I think it has more to do with the way the class is taught. We’re using the case method which is very interactive, and I think students enjoy hearing what other students have to say. Kids are thinking in real-time, which is exciting and interesting.
3. FM: What made you decide on the case method?
DLA: I had experienced the case method as an MBA student, after coming from a very large university where there were enormous classes, and to go into my very first MBA...I loved the learning experience. It was fun to come up with your own way of thinking about a concept or theory, and then to put it out there and have other students challenge it.
4. FM: Can you describe your students in five words?
DLA: Motivated. Passionate. Energetic. Busy. Overcommitted? Yes. Absolutely overcommitted. And curious.
5. FM: Why do you think people are so overcommitted here?
DLA: I think part of it is the culture of the institution. People look around and see that their next-door neighbor is doing three or four extra things, so they feel that they’re not worthy unless they are also doing that. I think that’s something that really distinguishes Harvard college students from, say, Princeton and Yale.
6. FM: On the CUE guide, students have used words like “enthusiastic,” “inspiring,” and “wonderful” to describe you. Someone even wrote, “David Ager is quite possibly the coolest professor at Harvard.” Do you think you’re cool?
DLA: Wow. Now, the sociologist in me would say, “What do you mean by ‘cool?’” I guess it’s the combination of all those qualities. I’d like to think that that’s just a part of who I am. To be honest, I feed off of my students. When they’re curious and passionate, how can I not become curious myself?
7. FM: How would you describe your teaching style?
DLA: I take teaching very seriously, so I take a lot of time preparing for my classes. I try to go in and really enjoy myself. If I’m passionate and enthusiastic about what I’m teaching, then hopefully that will convey to my students and draw them in as well. One thing that characterizes my teaching style is also to work with students to empower them, to confront that about which they’re uncertain, and then to help them master it.
8. FM: What do you think makes a good leader?
DLA: Contexts matter a lot, so the ability to come into a new situation and quickly assess what’s going on, and then to be flexible enough, perceptive enough, and to have a repertoire of skills to respond in an appropriate way, is what makes a really good leader.
9. FM: Who is one global leader that you admire?
DLA: Mother Teresa of Calcutta has always fascinated me. It’s her selflessness, and this great ability to mobilize very few resources and large number of people to do work, to help the most destitute of destitute, people who the rest of the society has forgotten. I’m just very impressed.
10. FM: It’s interesting that you chose a woman. Does gender matter in leadership?
DLA: Not at all. I think women, in moving up in organizations, face challenges that men don’t face, and we’re trying to remove those obstacles, because we realize that diversity is really important in terms of creating high-performing team and organizations.
11. FM: Do you think the US is ready for a female president?
DLA: It’d have been good to have one 30 or 40 years ago. Gender, race, or ethnicity shouldn’t matter. It should be about who the human being is and the ability to lead.
12. FM: If you were to meet Mark Zuckerberg right now, what would you say to him?
DLA: What it’s like to have a movie made about himself. And how we can improve his experience. I get the sense that he wasn’t always totally happy here. The other thing would be what we could do as an institution to help students pursue their ideas and still stay in school and finish their degree.
13. FM: Do you think your class is geared towards students planning on business school?
DLA: There probably are a large number who end up in traditional for-profit business, consulting or investment banking, but I’ve also had a number of students who have gone into education, government, and not-for-profit industries. So I think it’s geared towards students with a curiosity and fascination about leadership and an interest in making a difference.
14. FM: Do you think there exists a culture of careerism at Harvard?
DLA: No, because I’ve seen students who are truly friends. In my course, when we talk about social capital theory and building one’s social network, I try to impress upon students the need to have people within your network who provide “socio-emotional support.” I think to stay healthy as human beings, we need individuals to whom we can turn to confide almost anything.
15. FM: You’ve worked as a consultant for large multinational firms from a variety of industries, as well as the Canadian government. What keeps bringing you back to academia?
DLA: The most exciting thing for me in terms of being here is the students. I have the great privilege of being able to work with students who have ideas for enterprises, to sit with them and think through the issues that surround launching organizations, then create a viable structure, and finally get those organizations off the ground. Why would you want to leave all that? To be so lucky.

Many people associate the word “bodybuilding” with an image of a pre-gubernatorial Arnold, flexing his biceps and flashing his mega-watt smile in an unnerving way. But some Harvard students are determined to expand that limited conception.
“It’s not strictly about becoming Schwarzenegger,” said Peter R. Swiatek ’12, a founder of the Harvard Bodybuilding Club, a newly approved club sport which held its inaugural meeting last Friday. In reality, “HBC aims to create a spirit of fellowship among both male and female students interested in bodybuilding, powerlifting, cardiovascular training, nutrition, and general health,” according to a promotional flyer circulated prior to the meeting.
Swiatek, who left the varsity basketball team his sophomore fall due to a knee injury, found his second athletic home at the Malkin Athletic Center. “I go to the gym everyday and see the same people, so why not create a community of people with a similar interest in working out?” he said.
Among the attendees of the Friday meeting was Andrew J. Zhang ’13. “I wanted to become a professional ping-pong player, but not anymore because I won’t be able to feed my family,” he said. But bodybuilding may confer benefits that are more enticing than money.
“Bodybuilding is free, and I want to get that ideal body,” said Zhang, while glancing up at Swiatek, who towers at 6 feet 7 inches.
However, the complete lack of a female presence proved disappointing for Swiatek. “We want girls,” he said.
“Girls probably get intimidated by the idea,” said co-founder Jordan R. Milan ’11, who said his role model is Arnold circa 1974. “But we’re harmless,” he added.
Aside from attracting female interest, potential future plans for the club include a “Mr. & Mrs. Ivy League” bodybuilding competition and a charitable event. Perhaps another shirtless calendar series is in order?

Let’s be honest: Boston is hardly the world’s sexiest city. While Brazilians frolic in tiny bikinis, and the French go topless, we like to layer up in Hunter boots and Barbour coats and pretend that frump is the new sex. It ain’t true.
However, this new “shoes with toes” trend takes ugly to new levels. Crocs came and faded for a reason: everyone started to realize that despite their comfort, they were absolutely disgusting looking. So why have shoes with toes started to take off? They’re even uglier than Crocs—something no one thought possible.
The website for Vibram FiveFingers shoes even has a section dedicated to fighting counterfeiters. Are you kidding me? These aren’t Manolo Blahniks or Louis Vuitton bags. Who is going around counterfeiting these foot gloves, and even worse, who is buying them? They come in every color and pattern, in case you want to coordinate with whatever you delude yourself into thinking actually matches with these things.
If you want to be comfortable, invest in some warm socks, or footwear that doesn’t make you look like you’re wearing condoms for your feet. Sure, they may make you “stronger and healthier” and improve your “proprioception” as the website promises, although that is a) doubtful and b) what does that even mean?
But in the end, these things can’t even be called shoes. At best, they’re awkward looking slippers. At worst, they will make it impossible for you to get laid if you wear these any place other than Trader Joe’s or a granola convention.

I distinctly remember one night in elementary school, sitting in our darkened living room, watching Ike hit Tina Turner. I was small enough that, rather than looking directly at the TV, I was sitting in my mother’s lap, facing her, watching the reflection of the movie reflected in her glasses.
This was not an isolated or even particularly notable incident. A big part of my childhood was the consumption of media—primarily movies—that were not strictly age-appropriate. I learned what a condom was on a road trip when my parents chose “White Oleander” as a book-on-tape (the 14-year-old protagonist has safe sex with her foster father). When, earlier this year, my blockmates watched “Being John Malkovich,” I realized that the first time I had seen John Cusack imprison a screaming Cameron Diaz in her pet ape’s cage was when my family watched the movie in the late ’90s. And you know the scenes in “Middlesex” where the hermaphrodite does it not-quite-consensually with her best friend’s brother and then with her best friend? The New Yorker once published those as a single short story, which I devoured during a sleepover at my best friend’s house. I was 13.
However, I can say with certainty that all of that precociously consumed literary kink failed to make even a fraction of the indelible impact of another relatively age inappropriate film genre—reunion movies. Specifically, “The Big Chill.”
If you haven’t seen this 1983 paean to the lost idealism and intimacy of youth, here’s what you need to know: seven college friends reunite at the funeral of their suicidal classmate and spend a weekend figuring out who they have become. If it sounds maudlin, that’s because it is. A key scene involves the cast (Jeff Goldblum, Glenn Close, Kevin Kline, still in the prime of early middle age) boogying to The Temptations as they clean up after dinner. They say things like, “A long time ago we knew each other for a short period of time; you don’t know anything about me.” This is ironic, given that all of the characters are types: the childless career woman, the unfulfilled TV star, the lecherous reporter, the golden couple rent asunder by adultery.
The movie’s message—as I perceived it at 10 or 11—was that promising young people grow up to be miserably flawed adults. Armed with that knowledge, I felt solemn, wise, a clear-eyed Cassandra in braces and pigtails. I filled a page of my sixth-grade English notebook with succinct, semi-tragic imagined futures for all of my classmates. “Mary will be an overly perky housewife,” I wrote, “struggling against the emptiness of her suburban existence...By 37, Joey will have divorced twice.”
In the ensuing decade, I mellowed out, but I still managed to develop a deep fondness for break-up songs before I’d ever had a boyfriend. In high school, I became convinced that one of my friends was destined for political greatness, which meant that I should plan on writing his official biography, and that implied a lot of guesswork about fatal campaign mistakes. It’s still too early to say whether this guy is the next Rahm Emanuel, but it’s relevant that at this point about 80 percent of his Facebook photos involve shirtlessness and beer.
A lot of people (read: at least four of my blockmates) enjoy imagining what it will be like to look back on the present from the otherwise difficult-to-fathom distance of old-ish age. At an Arts First jazz concert toward the end of sophomore year, prompted by the atmosphere of tents, haute HUDS, and elderly people, I started pretending that my friends and I were at our 50th college reunion. “How’s the law practice?” I asked my friend Dave, who quickly caught on and made something up about his embezzling partner, “Stevens.” We compared prospective retirement communities (New Mexico all the way) and traded withering assessments of today’s youth (no respect). “Remember the good old days?” we asked one another.
My roommate, who has been subjected to a lot of my future projections, calls them “prenostalgia,” which I think is pretty accurate. Not to get too philosophical, bro, but it’s sort of like an experiment in Hegelian history—I know what the present is like, but what will it mean in the context of various possible futures?
College is a particularly ripe time for it, since my sources (“The Big Chill”) indicate that now is when people lay the groundwork for their life paths, like getting discovered by a record label or real-life marrying that person they’ve been Harvard-married to since FOP. But when senior fall rolls around things get a little too real. Almost no one knows exactly what they’re doing next year, but everyone is asking, so imagining ideal, or even probable, futures seems like tempting fate.
Instead, my latest prenostalgic indulgence consists of figuring out what jobs people could feasibly get that would make them total sell-outs, or at least really unsatisfied. I know one guy who wants to direct cerebral dramas. But what if he could only make it as a porn director? The outdoorsy science concentrator is destined for a desk job at SeaWorld. The guy who wants to be a union organizer? Prep school admissions officer.
A variation on this game is coming up with weird superlatives that would never actually end up in a yearbook, and apply them to people you know. Most likely to be the subject of a wide-eyed biography in The Atlantic. Most likely to invent a fad diet. Most likely to cheat on their kid’s application to private kindergarten. Et cetera.
When you’re a kid, it’s really hard to comprehend what it would be like to be an adult. And that when you’re in college and supposedly more mature, demonstrating that maturity sometimes requires ironic detachment from very real concerns. And once you’re a parent, you should probably rethink that family screening of “The 40-Year-Old Virgin.”
Sarah J. Howland '11 is a Social Studies concentrator in Mather House. She likes John Cusack and Hegel equally.

When the going gets tough, the overwhelmed escape town. That was my rationale behind why I wouldn’t feel guilty for a mini-vacation in the midst of midterm season, recruiting, and an ever-mounting stack of responsibilities. I’d been “planning” my culinary vacation to Portland, Maine for about a month. By “plan,” I mean that my better half had taken care of the inn reservation. A week before departure, I tried to make dinner reservations on OpenTable, only to discover that all the top picks were booked solid.
A lot of my plans are like this. Forging ahead in chaos.
Thankfully, a sushi place not on OpenTable still had spots open. Miyake at 8:15 p.m. it was. We rolled into Miyake (129 Spring St.) after a surprisingly pleasant drive. It was a small restaurant with brightly colored walls and a reputation for excellent omakase—a chef’s choice tasting. The evening was nothing short of magical. The first course included raw lobster, slippery and fresh as the sea, along with artful cuts of raw fish. Then came seared scallops with delicata squash and roasted brussels sprouts. Our waitress then carried out the most tender, melting swordfish with fingerling potato in a dash broth. The fourth course was more French than Japanese—a beautifully plated duck confit and roast duck with foie gras and quince paste. We were getting full, but there was still unagi and sardine nigiri, picked up with the fingers and quickly consumed.
Finally, the pièce de résistance, ordered à la carte: the lobster roll. Not a lobster roll in a hot dog bun, but a kind of lobster maki topped with a fat, sweet piece of lobster claw meat and caviar. The diners next to us at the sushi bar were so delighted with their food that they handed the chef a shot glass of sake which he accepted, beaming. I snuck some cake out of the inn’s dining room and fell asleep.
The next morning, we went to the highly recommended Duckfat (43 Middle St.). They’re famous for their fries, appropriately prepared in a vat of roiling duck fat. I ordered these beauties with a side of duck gravy and clutched the greasy paper bag as we ate it standing up, then sitting on the curb outside, as there were no chairs available. They were outrageously, unbelievably good. The fat had penetrated so deeply that they instantly melted after the slightest crisp hesitation. I drank up the rest of the gravy. Ah, vacation.
Then it was off to J’s Oyster (5 Portland Pier). The place had a homey, hokey charm to it, and their lobster roll contained an absurd amount of fresh lobster meat for only $12.50. My Yelp iPhone app informed me that Anthony Bourdain had also enjoyed their lobster rolls. I slurped down a few dollar oysters and rinsed clams (known as “steamers”) in drawn butter without shame. After so many calories, I rapidly fell into a food coma and took a four-hour nap at the inn before heading out for dinner. Somehow, I’d managed to snag same-day reservations at Fore Street for 9:45 p.m.
Fore Street (288 Fore St.) was a farm-to-table powerhouse with an open kitchen and “wood oven grilled” entrées. The star here were the wood-roasted mussels with almond-garlic wine sauce, best sopped up with good, thick bread. I devoured a perfectly grilled pork chop, then some dessert, drove back to the inn and watched a romantic comedy about a middle-aged woman before falling asleep.
I left Portland the next afternoon, fat and relaxed, but didn’t forget to pick up a box of fried clams (rubbery and disappointing) before I left, then another cone of fries from Duckfat. After returning to Boston, I made stir-fried kale and chicken for dinner and settled into bed with my laptop. My head, for the first time in weeks, felt clear. My stomach, on the other hand, ached.

Hey Germanic Studies Professor Peter J. Burgard: What exactly is Oktoberfest and why is it celebrated around the world?
The original Oktoberfest was a beer festival that was celebrated to drink the remaining Märzenbier or “March beer” supplies, because at the time, a brewing law existed that designated how long a beer could be stored before it went bad. In fact, this year is the 200th anniversary of Oktoberfest. The reason Oktoberfest is so popular is because it is essentially an enormous beer-drinking party and is also said to be the largest festival in the world, with over six million participants traveling from around the world to Munich to celebrate. Many of these foreign participants bring the tradition back to their countries of origin. So I guess the basic answer to why it is so popular around the world is: who wouldn’t want to imitate the world’s biggest party?

In a music studio on the top floor of Paine Hall on a Sunday night, Abel Acuña ’11 sits alone in front of three computer screens, carefully dragging little bars of sights and sounds back and forth, trying to form the perfect sequence.
He’s making a video that turns the whooshing sounds of ping-pong paddles and the crisp thumps of ping-pong balls into a visual masterpiece. It’s for class, he explains. He makes one of these videos every two weeks.
Two summers ago, an internship at HBO convinced Acuña that he’d rather make videos than go to law school or study international relations—what he had initially thought were his dream paths when he arrived at Harvard.
Acuña is one of many Harvard students who have chosen to digress from the more traditional paths of law school, medical school, consulting, or investment banking. He rushed to finish his Government requirements by the end of his junior year so that he could have his last year to do what he enjoyed most—telling stories through film.
You’re approaching the end of your career at Harvard College. But before you lay your hands on that illustrious sheet of paper that cost four years and $200,000 in tuition, you have to decide what you’re going to do with it.
According to surveys of Harvard seniors conducted by The Crimson over the past three years, the number of students entering the finance and consulting sector of the work force has fallen since the economic recession.
Between the graduating classes of 2008 and 2009, the number of seniors opting for finance and consulting jobs decreased by half. In 2010, the percentage of seniors entering the workforce who were pursuing those paths rose to 30.52 percent, though that number still represents a decrease from the 47 percent in 2007.
Considering recent economic changes, does having a Harvard degree today still come with the assurances it entailed in the past? How much does that depend on what field you choose to pursue after graduation?
The simple answer is that diversity has replaced prestige. For the most part, the market for new employees has begun to change, privileging graduates from a variety of backgrounds rather than merely leading employers to select who was traditionally thought of as “the best.” Meanwhile, as the statistics suggest, to a certain extent, Harvard students are opening themselves up to a wider variety of opportunities.
A PUSH FOR DIVERSITY
With the recent decrease in seniors entering jobs in consulting and finance comes an increased interest in education, entertainment, and public service, though the number of students entering those fields still remains quite low.
In fact, 16.86 percent of the class of 2010 indicated public service as their “dream” field, and 13.95 percent selected the arts—yet only 11 percent of the class planning to work entered public service, and a paltry 4 percent opted for the arts.
The same survey results confirm that less than a third of students entering finance indicated that it would be their “dream” field if money were not a consideration.
Nonetheless, Deborah Carroll, Director of Career Services for On-Campus Interview and Employer Relations, suggests that there has been a trend toward students seeking a wider range of opportunities.
“The recession freed people up a bit to think outside the box,” says Carroll. “To think about a lot of factors in addition to security—what they enjoy.”
As a result, the Office of Career Services has paid careful attention to students’ varied interests, trying to make a “community” around career exploration. Food. Fashion. Criminology. Sustainable agriculture. These are the tables that draw increasing crowds at career fairs. They’re clusters of change requested by students who seemed to have realized that finding careers that follow their passions should play a greater role in the job search than before.
Three years ago, OCS began a campaign to repackage the job search to fit a more diverse selection of careers.
At the top of their Fall 2010 Undergraduate Programming guide, OCS lists “Entertainment and Creative Management” and “Environment, Energy, Sustainability, and Global Food Production.” “Consulting, Finance, Hedge Funds” sits below the handout’s fold.
While there seems to be a shift toward diversity in students’ interests, a similar phenomenon can also be seen on the hiring side.
“There’s been a push to diversify,” says Robin Mount, Director of the Office of Career, Research, and International Opportunities. “There’s less of an interest in having everyone from the same school.”
Recruiters like Disney, Mount notes, are interested in hiring a few employees from many different schools. This year, Disney is looking to fill only two positions through Harvard’s On-Campus Interview program.
But if diversity is placed at the forefront of concern, what does this mean for Harvard students currently entering the job market?
FORGING YOUR OWN PATH
“You’re at Harvard. Harvard College. The greatest institution for learning ever created, right? Up there with Oxford. And yet, here you are, with a passion for celebrity news. Hah,” said her subject, in biting disbelief.
Sanyee Yuan ’12 smiled blankly at her interviewee before blurting out a response to defend herself. He didn’t buy it.
“But now you’re editing yourself,” he retorted. “Just a moment ago, you said your passion was covering what’s available in supermarkets as you check out at the counter...Well, I’ll give you this. I’ll give you points for honesty.”
“Oh, thank you,” she replied quickly, still keeping her wide smile and trying to regain control of the conversation.
“And I’ll give myself points for diplomacy,” she said.
It was only a few minutes into her first on-camera interview as host of her new online talk show, “Talk Harvard,” and already, Yuan knew it was going downhill. Her interviewee—MSNBC political commentator Chris Matthews—was good.
Yuan always wanted to go into broadcast journalism. She wrote for her school newspaper before college. She watches Oprah religiously, and looks to Ryan Seacrest as her career idol.
But opportunity has played games with her, working in and out of her favor. Her dreams of acting in front of the camera were put on hold her freshman year after auditions for “Ivory Tower” and “On Harvard Time” did not land her any roles. Instead, she chose to work on publicity and write for the shows.
But two summers ago, Yuan landed an internship at CBS-5, her hometown CBS station. There, she realized that she was actually interested not just in broadcast journalism, but specifically in entertainment news.
Yet it would be difficult for her to apply to jobs in that field, since she had not cast been in a campus show that would give her an impressionable reel.
She met a producer that summer. who asked why she wasn’t hosting her own show. Yuan decided to create her own opportunities.
HARVARD-EDUCATED EDUCATORS
Education is quickly becoming one of the top paths for Harvard students after graduation.
Applications for Teach For America soared in the spring—with 293 applicants making up 17 percent of the graduating 2010 class. Last year, the largest proportion of Harvard’s senior class decided to apply to the program in its 19-year history.
This trend prevails outside of Harvard as well. Overall, the program received 46,359 applications for 2010, marking the third consecutive year of over 30 percent growth, The Crimson reported.
“We think there’s a renewed excitement around engaging in civic work with a new administration and a new political landscape,” says Amanda L. Hillman ’02, managing director of alumni affairs at TFA in the Greater Boston Area.
“I still think people have a choice for what they want to do with this education they’ve invested in,” Hillman says. “By applying that degree to social problems, and in particular, education, in terms of TFA’s recruitment, I think we’ve been able to raise awareness more widely and deeply about the problem of education inequity, and our teachers and alumni are impacting the academic performance and life trajectories for students in low-income communities.”
OCS has unofficially dubbed the phenomenon the “TFA Effect,” noting that a growing national conversation about education reform could have prompted the recent surge in interest in pursuing public service jobs.
It’s as if students are saying, “Wow, I’ve had this huge opportunity to study at Harvard, and I want to give it back,” Hillman says.
The same mindset has garnered increased interest in other education organizations, such as Teach for All, Teach for India, and the Undergraduate Teacher Education Program, Mount suggests.
“I think that awareness has allowed people to understand that eliminating education inequity is a choice that people have to make,” Hillman says. “We can do something about it.”
Though TFA’s numbers suggest that Harvard students are demonstrating increased enthusiasm for non-profit work, according to Laura E. Clancy ’03, the Harvard degree can be of uncertain value in the not-for-profit sector.
“We have learned not necessarily to get totally caught up in the Harvard name and the Harvard brand,” says Clancy, a recruiter at New Sector Alliance, a social impact consulting and leadership development firm.
Clancy says that the number of offers extended to Harvard students by New Sector Alliance over the years has actually decreased, while the number of applicants has remained about the same.
Last summer, New Sector worked closely with the United Negro College Fund, and had a lot of applicants from small schools in the South who “knocked everyone’s socks off”—including those from Harvard.
Clancy explains that there are two real advantages to the Harvard degree: one, that everyone will assume that you’re smart, and two, that nobody can ever one-up you.
“The only school that never has to worry about not being Harvard is Harvard,” Clancy recalls once hearing.
But workplace diversity requires people to come from all sorts of backgrounds to bring their own experiences, she explains.
“Part of what we look for in applicants is enthusiasm,” Clancy says. “We are looking for people who are really gung-ho about being part of our program and our community.”
It’s really important in the interviews, she says, to show your enthusiasm, not only for the work that you’ve done in the past, but also for the company that you will be working for.
But while working in business may seem to provide a more wholesale solution, students pursuing careers in the non-profit sector face greater uncertainty.
“You can kind of be tossed into the wild,” Clancy says. “It’s really daunting from the perspective of OCS.”
NO BUSINESS LIKE SHOW BUSINESS
For him, the challenge is entering an industry where the work is on a project-by-project basis, and security is fleeting, Acuña says.
While his classmates slowly secure their consulting and investment banking positions long before graduation, Acuña says he has to wait until late spring to apply for positions in Los Angeles, for instance.
The Harvard degree does help in getting your foot in the door and maybe having your script read, Acuña says. “But in the entertainment industry, people really don’t care where you went to college at all,” he says.
More important than the Harvard name are networks of alumni, or as Amit Samuel, director of Harvardwood 101 and the Harvardwood Summer Internship Program, calls them, “tribes.”
Founded in 1999, Harvardwood is a non-profit organization that seeks to connect Harvard alumni with students interested in careers in the arts, media, and entertainment.
“The reality is that the tension is not between Harvard people and other people—rather between people that succeed and people that want to succeed,” Samuel says.
There are numerous Harvard alumni out there trying to make their mark in entertainment, Samuel says. The only difference is that Hollywood is an apprenticeship, and one has to accept what an apprenticeship system entails.
“Nobody comes to Hollywood and [goes] to the top of the heap right away,” Samuel explains. “You come into it and kind of understand the rhythms of things. I can give you the sheet of music for Beethoven, but you’re not going to understand the feeling of Beethoven until a big orchestra plays it.”
And Harvard degree or no Harvard degree, students seeking careers in entertainment will be expected to conform to the apprenticeship system.
“You’re going to have to bring a Diet Coke to J. Lo.,” says Mount. “You can’t say ‘I’m too educated to go get coffee.’”
LEVERAGING THE ‘HARVARD BRAND’
As a campus representative for Harvardwood, Yuan attends career fairs to give students more information on finding careers in entertainment. She frequently encounters students who are wary about using their Harvard degree to embark on such a path.
“I really like film, but I think my parents would be happier if I didn’t major in VES,” she recalls a student telling her.
However, the Harvard education provides Yuan and others with a helpful network to advance their careers—from the connections available through Crimson Compass to the alumni willing to provide advice through programs such as Harvardwood 101.
But the Harvard connection that Harvardwood provides can work both ways, Acuña says. On the one hand, you have access to a group of alumni that have experience and resources who could potentially help you carry out your project. But on the other, first and foremost, your work has to demonstrate your own talent.
When people ask Acuña what he is studying at Harvard, he responds, “Government and film.”
Often, people will ask why he went to Harvard rather than opting for a school that is better known for its film program, such as the University of Southern California or New York University.
Acuña says that if he hadn’t gone to Harvard, where he was able to see all his options laid out on the table, he probably wouldn’t have chosen this option, and may have ended up pursuing the path that his parents had originally envisioned for him.
“Harvard students are afraid of rejection,” Yuan says. “What matters most is what you learn from the failures of life. After you graduate from Harvard, not finding a six-figure salary job is not failure. You just have to be the best at what you end up doing.”
IN PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS
Several factors contribute to students’ decisions to eschew stereotypical “Harvard jobs,” such as consulting, finance, hedge funds, and business.
Particularly, it seems that the mindset of “I’m just going to do consulting for a couple of years” has changed.
“People have realized that material wealth is fleeting,” Clancy says, “that happiness is more important, that life is short. For the folks who love consulting and banking, there are folks who love it and are great at it. But life is short.”
Samuel describes the entertainment business as “soul-satisfying.”
“If the creative outlet is something that you want to do, you’ll find it to be the most satisfying thing ever,” he says. “If what satisfies you the most is just making an amazing balance sheet or putting together corporate structure, and that’s what makes you very excited, regardless of how much it pays you, you should still do it.”
Acuña echoes a similar sentiment, explaining that he enjoys the sense of satisfaction that comes from doing something he really cares about.
“In Hollywood,” Samuel says, “long-term commitment and hard work will out distance talent every day of the week. If you have a minimum amount of talent for what you’re doing, that long-term commitment and hard work will make you successful.
“It won’t make you a billionaire,” he says, “but it will make you happy. And what’s more important than happiness?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 225 million Americans live in cities, but this country’s metropolises are far behind their European counterparts when it comes to active discussion of urban sustainability based on 2000 Census data, according to Harvard Graduate School of Design Professor Martha Schwartz.
Given increasing environmental and social problems in American cities, urban centers must confront issues of urban sustainability, a trend that has led Schwartz to launch the Working Group for Sustainable Cities at the Harvard University Center for the Environment. The group aims to bring together the wide range of resources available at Harvard to address the complex issues faced by cities attempting to reach sustainable goals.
The group is by nature highly interdisciplinary, with members from six of Harvard’s graduate schools and two FAS departments. In addition, the group includes several professionals from the fields of architecture, urban planning, and business.
Schwartz, a professor in practice of landscape architecture, founded the group in 2008. Sustainability in an urban sense, she said, goes beyond using renewable energy sources or conserving water.
“Most people think of ‘green’ when they think of sustainability, but when you talk about cities, there are many more forces,” Schwartz said, stressing the complexity of the issues. “It isn’t just about technology and smart buildings.”
According to Schwartz, urban sustainability also involves ideas of governance, culture, transportation, infrastructure, expectations, and values.
While the working group is interdisciplinary, science plays an integral role in informing its work.
“Obviously science is critical—you have to understand what science and technology and engineering can provide,” said Daniel P. Schrag, a professor of earth and planetary sciences and director of the Harvard University Center for the Environment.
Schrag, a member of the working group and an expert on climate change and the environment, similarly emphasized the multidisciplinary nature of urban sustainability problems.
Schwartz said she was inspired to start the group after witnessing the consequences of rapid but uninformed urbanization in cities like Dubai.
The group is currently holding a series of informal “Mayors Luncheons” with city leaders from around the Boston area, which are hosted by the Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics.
These luncheons will be used to prepare for a future program of roundtables with Mayors from across the nation. So far, members of the group have met with officials from Medford and Somerville, among others, and plan to meet with Cambridge city officials today.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since the very beginning, Physical Universe 27, “Science and Cooking: From Haute Cuisine to the Science of Soft Matter” has found itself at the center of attention for its ability to attract not only science concentrators, but also the larger undergraduate population.
About 600 students showed up for the class’ debut, nearly doubling the 350-person capacity of the lecture hall. Such record-high numbers can be attributed to the Standing Committee of General Education’s pedagogical and philosophical review of the course’s curricula, according to course instructors.
The course’s existence “is critically reliant” on the Gen Ed program, according to Michael P. Brenner, one of the course instructors and area dean of applied mathematics. “The notion of doing this in this way was inspired by the Gen Ed program,” he said, adding that he would not have taught the course outside the context of Gen Ed.
The course’s status as a Gen Ed offering has been crucial for its ability to attract the undergraduate population, beyond science concentrators, according to Brenner. In fact, the course’s wider appeal to non-concentrators attracted him to the teaching role.
Although teaching a class of students with science backgrounds would be “much easier,” Brenner said, it would also be “much less interesting.”
“The appeal of doing this is that it’s an opportunity to try to communicate with student who ordinarily might not be so interested [in science],” he said.
Administrative Director of the Program in General Education Stephanie H. Kenen said she hopes the strong base of interest shown by non-science concentrators for Science and Cooking will be seen throughout the Gen Ed curriculum. Classes specifically designed to attract students from different academic backgrounds—such as the introductory class Computer Science 50—ultimately define the Gen Ed program, Kenen said.
“There are quite a few courses offered by various departments that meet the pedagogical goals of general education and that also meet the pedagogical demands of a concentration,” she said. “Gen Ed is about connecting what students learn in the classroom to life outside of Harvard.
The primary pedagogical goal of certain courses that fulfill Gen Ed requirements is to serve as stepping stones within their concentrations—for example, several introductory physics classes are targeted towards concentrators who hope to continue studying the discipline. But Gen Ed courses like CS50 and SPU27 emphasize the broader themes that may be applicable to life after Harvard.
Science and Cooking explores the physical and chemical properties of matter through the lens of cooking science. Weekly lectures feature food experts in the field of “molecular gastronomy,” a discipline that uses science to re-engineer food, and lab sections involve cooking and eating.
CS50, another popular Gen Ed course that has drawn the non-science-concentrating contingent, has seen its enrollment jump 56 percent from last year, from 337 students last fall to 525 this year. The course—led by lecturer David J. Malan ’99—is now the fourth largest undergraduate class offered at the College.
According to Malan, many of the students—40.3 percent—take the class as an elective, compared to the 37.6 percent that take the class for concentration credit and the 6.7 percent for Gen Ed credit.
“Inasmuch as CS50 is intended for concentrators and non-concentrators alike, we actually felt that the course was, by design, well suited for inclusion in Ged Ed,” Malan said in a written statement.
“I think especially what David Malan has been doing is great,” said Associate Professor of Chemical Engineering and Physics Vinothan N. Manoharan. “He’s made that class accessible to a large portion of the undergraduate population.”
“I think there are big ideas taught in these classes, and those ideas are woven into the class that are interesting and accessible to a broad segment of the undergrads,” Manoharan added. “They really are teaching computer science and they really are teaching physics.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Monarch butterflies—famous for their royal wingspan and bold orange and black stripes—may be unconventional animals to study, but they have been the center of attention for Jeremy L. Hsu ’11 for the past year and a half.
Butterflies first piqued Hsu’s interest when he conducted summer research through a FAS Center for Systems Biology program, and he has stayed with the same lab ever since.
“Butterflies are very charismatic and gregarious, and they’re very cool to work with,” said Hsu, an Organismic and Evolutionary Biology concentrator.
He said that butterflies make “a great model system” to study because of their small size, short lifespan, low-maintenance, and “because everyone’s fascinated by them.”
Of the two existing subspecies of Monarch butterflies, one is notable for its annual mass migration from Northern America to Mexico and then northward again. The other subspecies does not migrate and lives yearlong in equatorial regions.
“I’m trying to figure out, why?” said Hsu.
The journey of the migratory butterflies lasts longer than the normal life span of one monarch; in fact, the generation that finally returns to the original site may be three to four generations removed from the original butterflies.
Previous studies, according to Hsu, have examined the factors that allow the first generation to live the longest. Other studies have focused on the neurological aspects of migration or the levels of gene expression in the different butterfly generations.
His study, Hsu said, investigates the genetic basis that distinguishes the two subspecies’ migratory behavior.
Most of the time he spends in lab is spent on genotyping, which involves extracting DNA, usually from the thorax of the insect, finding out the exact nucleotide sequence, and then comparing the sequences between the migratory and non-migratory subspecies.
The monarchs have been collected from all over the Americas, including Boston, California, Hawaii, and Ecuador, to ensure the robustness of the data.
Hsu recalled his interesting trip to Costa Rica to obtain more butterflies samples.
“You just swing, hope you get them. Then, many curses,” said Hsu, of catching butterflies using a large net.
“I really enjoyed the field work. It was a great experience,” he added.
Hsu has already found some promising results, and some of the gene sequences have indeed shown differences between the two subspecies. The genes of interest found so far control energy production, sun-compass orientation, and the juvenile hormone pathway, which regulates development and reproduction.
Having already presented his results at two biology conferences over the summer, Hsu is working to develop his current project into a senior thesis.
Marcus R. Kronforst, the lab’s principal investigator, said the results “may be zeroing in some spots in the genome that are very significant and lead to an explanation of migration behavior differences.”
“[Hsu] is a very self-motivated scientist, and he has been tackling this project in a very comprehensive way,” said Kronforst, who is a Bauer Fellow at the Center for Systems Biology. “His project may be for a senior thesis, but the level of work that he is doing is on the level of that of a [graduate student.]”

A team of undergraduates will build water-turbines that use flowing ocean water to generate electricity, as part of an effort to expand opportunities for undergraduates to take on real-world engineering projects.
Students will collaborate with engineers from Hydrovolts—a hydropower company founded by Burt Hamner ’83 that specializes in making hydrokinetic turbines—on the project, sponsored by Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and the Harvard College Engineering Society.
Once completed, the turbines will be used by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution for research.
“This is a great opportunity for [engineering students] to see how industrial process of design works,” said Sarah J. Shareef ’12, co-president of the engineering society.
Currently, deep-sea sensors that take continuous measurements of the ocean’s biological and chemical processes are powered by batteries—a costly and inefficient model, since the batteries need to be replaced when they run out, according to Barry A. Griffin ’71, a visiting SEAS lecturer who is coordinating the project.
The team will design a turbine that can generate enough electricity to power the sensors, thereby eliminating the need to replace batteries as frequently, he explained.
The students will first learn how the existing model works so that they “can optimize it and explore new uses for this technology,” Griffin said.
Hydrokinetics, or making use of technology that takes advantage of flowing water, has great relevance to today’s society, especially in India and Pakistan, according to Griffin. For example, water turbines can be placed in irrigation canals to supply power to villages.
This project marks SEAS’ growing trend of bringing opportunities for undergraduates to work beyond the scope of Harvard labs. This year, according to Griffin, five senior projects involve collaboration with outside companies.
“We’re looking to generate long-term relationships with companies and other institutions to provide real-world engineering projects for our students...both within and outside the curriculum,” said Griffin, who mentors students’ senior projects.
This year-long project will be a significant time commitment, said Daniel H. Nevius ’11, co-president of HCES.
By April, Griffin said, the students are expected to have created a working prototype, which will be tested in Cape Cod.
“Working in the industry is different from doing homework for a class. There will be an expectation to have results each week, so you have to be devoted,” said Nevius.
He added that the project is especially looking for freshman and sophomores to join the team, so that the project can be expanded in the future.

Air quality in northern China has improved as a result of government policies leading up to the 2008 Beijing Olympics, researchers from Harvard and Tsinghua University say.
Over the past six years, the ratio of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide—known as “combustion efficiency”—in the air flows from Beijing has nearly doubled, meaning that China’s polluters have become more efficient, according to a study published last month in Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics.
Carbon dioxide is generally a product of efficient combustion, while carbon monoxide tends to come from inefficient combustion.
The study’s findings signal that China, the world’s largest carbon dioxide emitter, has replaced older inefficient carbon dioxide sources with cleaner technology, according to J. William Munger, a senior research fellow at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and co-author of the paper.
The station observed a notable decrease in carbon dioxide emissions and an increase in combustion efficiency as a result of government efforts to improve air quality in Beijing for athletes and tourists during the games, Munger said.
“We can see observationally what the impact of the air quality controls have been, and we can see that in fact there has been a reduction of carbon monoxide levels in the Beijing air,” he said. 
The study provides a new kind of quantitative evidence of         energy trends in China that is independent of government or         industry statistics, said Chris P. Nielsen, a co-author of the         paper.
The researchers collected data at a research station in Miyun, a rural area north of Beijing. By analyzing weather and wind patterns, they identified and measured pollutant levels carried in the air from Beijing in the south and differentiated it from cleaner air flowing from the north, Munger said.
Seasonal trends also affected their data collection as plants tend to absorb increased amounts of carbon dioxide during the spring and summer months, which the researchers said they accounted for in their analysis.
Since 2004, the research station has measured ozone, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide levels. Recently, researchers have added new instruments that measure other pollutants like nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, mercury, and black carbon, according to Munger.
“As you add more and more capability, you can do more and more interesting things comparing the data and looking at interactions between [different gas levels],” said Nielsen.
The research was conducted under the auspices of the Harvard China Project, which studies air pollution and greenhouse gases in China and their economic and health impacts.

Researchers at Harvard-affiliate Brigham and Women’s Hospital have launched a hospital-wide longitudinal study that will investigate links between genetic and environmental and lifestyle influences on disease, an effort that may advance personalized diagnosis and treatment for patients.
The initiative—known as “OurGenes, OurHealth, OurCommunity”—aims to enroll more than 100,000 patients and seeks to specify the genetic markers of certain types of diseases.
“The future benefit is that we can tailor therapy to patients based on their individual [health] profile,” said Elizabeth W. Karlson, an associate professor of medicine at the hospital and co-author of the study.
Karlson added genetic information—which patients provide in the form of a blood sample—could reveal key diagnostic cues. The data will, for example, allow physicians to identify patients at risk for drug oversensitivity, which could eliminate unforeseen drug overdoses.
Study participants are also asked to provide researchers with their medical history and information such as smoking habits, vitamin intake, and sun exposure, which together make up what the researchers call “environmental data.”
Certain genes can make individuals more prone to specific types of disease, so the researchers plan to run to analyze their data with a view to seeing how genetic and environmental factors can make an individual more likely to develop a disease, Karlson said.
“For instance, if we know a patient at risk for heart disease, we would look at other risk factors like cholesterol [levels] and smoking [habits],” Karlson said, noting that the data can enable scientists to isolate factors that cause disease.
Organizers plan to eventually incorporate genome sequencing, which they said could provide a more complete picture of a patient’s disease state, into the study.
Moreover, storing patient information in a what Karlson calls a “BioBank” will allow scientists to examine a disease of interest at any given time, a practice that may help advance both research and primary care treatment.
The data will be protected and only accessible to researchers associated with the study.
Of patients approached to participate in the study, 70 percent have agreed to participate, which Karlson said reflects growing excitement in the field and the study’s commitment to ensuring patient privacy.
“People have been waiting for a way to apply the human genome project, and this is the way to do it,” Karlson said.

The role of photojournalism in depicting conflict was examined from different perspectives during a panel discussion yesterday that commemorated the conclusion of a photo exhibit in the Center for Government and International Studies on civilian life during wartime.
The panelists—which included photojournalist Thorne Anderson, assistant professor at the University of Western Ontario Sharon Sliwinski, and International Committee of the Red Cross spokesman Simon Schorno—discussed the ways in which photojournalism can lead to public awareness and action against conflict.
Sliwinski, who researches visual culture, traced photojournalism back to the work of 18th-century Spanish artist Francisco Goya, who created rape-themed etchings drawn in an angle that makes viewers feel as if they are witnessing the scene.
Sliwinski added that photojournalism can bring about justice by generating sympathy and the desire for change for the injustices that it publicizes.
Schorno, who spoke from a humanitarian worker’s point of view, said that although photojournalists are sometimes viewed as “intrusions” in conflict zones, they ultimately share the same mission as aid workers.
“We both want to make a difference,” he said.
Anderson—who has worked as a photojournalist in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Macedonia—said the career is about “advocating to see what we don’t see because we don’t look in there.”
However, he cautioned that photojournalists’ depiction of conflict can sometimes run into moral ambiguities—with which the public is not always comfortable.
Attendees of the packed event said they learned much from the panel event.
“The talk was very informative and an effective triangulation of the problems [in photojournalism].” said local freelance photojournalist Dominick Reuter.
The panel marked the conclusion of the traveling photo exhibit “Our World at War: Photojournalism Beyond the Front Lines,” which was displayed in the CGIS South Concourse from Sept 9. until yesterday.
“The purpose of the event [was] to give the students and the public a chance to see the multifaceted, complex dynamics that the civilians face in conflicts and disasters,” said Vincenzo Bollettino, Director of Programs and Administration at the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative. “We want people to explore how the changing nature of warfare is affecting the way civilians are impacted.”

Renowned German musicologist and former Harvard Music Department Chair Reinhold Brinkmann passed away on Monday, Oct. 10, after a drawn-out battle with an illness in Eckernförde, Germany. He was 76.
Brinkmann was known as a professor not only for his musical prowess, but also for his enthusiasm in connecting music to its social and historical contexts.
Brinkmann first taught musicology at the University of Marburg and Hochschule der Künste in Germany before he came to Harvard as a professor of musicology in 1985. During the 18 years he taught at Harvard, he was a major presence in the Department of Music, eventually becoming the chair of the department and serving in the position until his retirement in 2003.
Students and colleagues recalled Brinkmann’s creativity and generosity of spirit.
“He was one of those professors that was really great, that you really remember,” said Blaine G. Saito ’04, a former student of Brinkmann. “He commanded a quiet presence and was really excited by his music. He will be missed by generations of students.”
“He was a creative thinker and inspiring teacher,” wrote current Music Department Chair and former dissertation advisee Anne C. Shreffler in an e-mailed statement. “He was a musicologist in the very broadest sense of the word: passionate about art, literature, sports, and travel ... [H]is work drew on his knowledge of many fields,”
In addition to his teaching and his music, Brinkmann was a prolific author of several ground-breaking works in the world of musicology, including his book-length critical report on the sources and historical and biographical position of Schoenberg’s “Pierrot Lunaire” in the Arnold Schoenberg Complete Edition.
Brinkmann was beloved in the Music Department, known as much for his gentle spirit as his scholarship.
“He was a wonderful scholar, with high intellectual standards, but kind and generous in his personal relationships,” wrote Music Professor Thomas F. Kelly in an e-mail to The Crimson.
Brinkmann is survived by his wife, Dorothea Brinkmann, in Germany.

Education experts questioned the efficacy of charter schools last night at a panel discussion on “Waiting for ‘Superman,’” a new and controversial documentary about the American education system.
The event, whose audience filled Askwith Hall, was held two weeks after the Harvard Graduate School of Education hosted an advanced screening of the film.
The five panelists—all Ed School faculty members—questioned the film’s heavy focus on American charter schools as a solution to problems in the education system.
“For me, the disappointment in the charter movement is that individuals are given a blank canvas to paint a school, and essentially they’ve painted the same schools we already have,” said Katherine K. Merseth, a senior lecturer at the Ed School. “I see a missed opportunity.”
According to Merseth, only 17 percent of charters actually perform better than public schools, whereas 46 percent do just as well, and 37 percent do worse.
Merseth added that some of the “finest charters” are using educational methods and strategies that can be applied to all types of schools.
Ed School Assistant Professor Martin R. West IV said he felt the director of the film chose to focus on this particular type of school system for dramatic effect.
“He’s a filmmaker,” said West of the documentary’s director, Davis Guggenheim. “He needed a climax in the film, and what better climax than the public lottery [to get into charter schools]?”
In addition, the film lacked an explanation as to why charter schools seemed to be the only answer, the panelists said.
“I think I would have more respect in Davis if he showed us his cards and was honest with us,” said Karen L. Mapp, an Ed School senior lecturer. “I think I would have wanted more transparency. It’s made people suspicious about the message.”
“Waiting for ‘Superman’” follows the stories of five children trying to enter charter schools across the United States.
The advance screening on Oct. 1 featured a video message addressed directly to the Ed School audience from Guggenheim, who also directed the climate change documentary “An Inconvenient Truth.”
The screening and panel discussions were part of the Ed School’s Askwith Forums, a series of public lectures that encourage conversations about education.
“It shouldn’t take a movie for us to raise awareness that education is important,” Mapp said.

With an ambitious plan to protect the environment and promote landscape development, Director of the Harvard Forest David R. Foster and his colleagues were recently honored with the Charles Eliot award.
The Harvard Forest is a 3,000-acre research forest in Petersham, Mass.
The Trustees of Reservations, the first private nonprofit conservation organization in the country, presents the Charles Eliot award to an individual or organization who advances their mission of preserving the landscape for public use, according to Trustee President Andrew W. Kendall.
The Harvard Forest’s “Wildlands and Woodlands: A Vision for the New England Landscape” report promotes a 50-year conservation effort to protect 70 percent of the 42 million acres of forests in New England from development. The forests would be divided with 10 percent as wildland reserves and 90 percent as managed woodlands. This component of the plan was a sequel to an original campaign, released in 2005, that focused on the conservation of forest exclusively in Massachusetts.
“Our feeling is that the efforts that David has spearheaded not only in Massachusetts but also throughout New England are serving a vital role of laying out a bold, ambitious vision for the future of our land,” Kendall said.
Foster—who served as an associate professor of biology at Harvard from 1983 to 1990 before he became director of the Harvard Forest—echoed similar sentiments on the benefits of such a far-reaching project.
“By being ambitious, it forces people to think very hard about the future. One way to look at it is ambitious, but it also allows almost doubling of the amount of development already in New England and accommodates economic growth,” Foster said.
Compared with other conservation policies, “Wildlands and Woodlands” represents an interdisciplinary effort by scientists and policy makers alike, Foster added.
The “Wildlands and Woodlands” report was co-authored by 20 forest ecologists and policy experts, many of whom are based at Harvard.
Those involved in the project stressed its importance in light of the high decline of forests today.
“The forest of every New England state is in decline for the first time in 150 years,” said Clarisse M. Hart, a co-author and communication manager for the project.
“I found it great that the project wanted to conserve large sections of land. Once the land is developed, it’s difficult to go back,” said Lisa N. Chen ’12, who worked at Harvard Forest last summer.

The international monetary system, population growth, and global governance were among six topics of discussion at the first-ever World Economic Forum dialogue held on a college campus.
The event, held yesterday at the Graduate School of Design, aimed to spark an exchange of ideas between students and professors who are experts in law, business, health, and design.
According to Michele Petochi, head of university community at the World Economic Forum, the Forum is a “neutral platform of dialogue that brings government, business, and non-profit leaders together to connect the dots, learn, and collaborate to find the best solutions to global problems.”
“This event is part of our evolution in providing the best expertise in the world,” Petochi added. “We have the privilege of testing this format at the number-one university in the world. It’s fascinating to have this forum at Harvard because of its family of schools, both undergraduate and graduate.”
“To put it bluntly,” Petochi later said, “the World Economic Forum of the past 40 years would not exist without Harvard.”
He added that the Forum was interested in creating a series of permanent dialogues hosted at universities, and the planning process began nearly six months ago. Through collaboration with GSD Professor Toshiko Mori, the event included panels and workshops where experts interacted with students and discussed their ideas and potential solutions to global problems in a format similar to that of the Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland.
This year’s program focused on proposals from the Forum’s Global Redesign Initiative, a year-long discussion among 1,200 world leaders and experts that aims to answer the question, “How can the architecture of global cooperation be redesigned not only to accommodate our deeper interdependence, but also to capitalize on it?”
Graduate School of Design Dean Mohsen Mostafavi emphasized the significance of holding the event at the Design School.
“We’re happy that it’s happening at the GSD because of the way in which many of the conversations have deep implications in terms of design,” Mostafavi said. “A lot of things, like population growth, have very specific physical manifestations. To understand those is very important for our relevance as an institution.”
Attendees similarly said they appreciated the use of a design lens in solving global issues.
“Coming from the field of design, to be exposed to concepts like population growth and have a baseline awareness of these issues is important for us not only as designers, but for society as a whole,” said Meghan E. Spigle, a student at the GSD.
When asked whether the Forum had plans to hold similar events in the future, Petochi said he was in discussions with the Fletcher School of Law & Diplomacy at Tufts University to hold a forum on international monetary policy, likely to be held next spring.
The Forum’s overall goal is to “provide experience to young people who will be future world leaders,” Petochi said.

Harvard queer students of color have formed “Gay, Lesbian, or Whatever” (GLOW), a new group that, according to its founders, is the first organization to address the interconnected experiences of underrepresented and marginalized identities.
Various cultural groups, including the Black Students Association and Harvard Radcliffe RAZA, are sponsoring GLOW’s meetings. The group, whose membership is confidential, will hold discussions on social policy, representation, and advocacy, as well as on experiences unique to its members.
GLOW founder Miguel Garcia ’12 described the group as one that creates an environment where people who have felt underrepresented in other campus groups can feel welcome.
“We’re working toward balancing an acknowledgment of differences with a celebration of similarities in order to establish a safe space, a community of trust and unconditional acceptance,” Garcia said.
“It’s previously been thought that if you’re gay and black, for example, that means go to BSA for your black identity and go to QSA for queer identity,” he added. “But those identities are not separate, and you can’t acknowledge them separately because you experience them together.”
History and Literature Lecturer Timothy P. McCarthy ’93—one of GLOW’s co-faculty advisers—stressed that issues of intersecting identities affect how people experience their lives.
“Intersectionality is part of the human condition,” McCarthy said. “We need to be mindful of how the identities that we navigate in different ways, at different times, and with different people, can intersect and impact people’s lives.”
Members of GLOW said they have felt that queer groups and cultural organizations on campus have not fully or explicitly acknowledged such intersectionalities. Garcia said that many of these groups often emphasize similarities between members to provide a sense of belonging, a tendency that can lead to a neglect—whether inadvertent or intentional—of the various identities represented within that group.
GLOW co-facilitator Emma Q. Wang ’12, who is also co-chair of Queer Students and Allies, echoed the idea that navigating areas of difference is a challenge.
“We come together by sharing the identity of being overlooked by a collective identity, and we bond over the acknowledgement of our distinct experiences,” Wang said, adding that GLOW’s aim is not to shun other organizations, but rather to embrace multiple aspects of people’s identity more explicitly.
Bryant D. Wright ’12—a co-facilitator of GLOW and communications chair of the Black Men’s Forum—stressed the difficulty of negotiating his identities as a person who is both African American and gay.
“When you have an identity that is stigmatized, you grow up learning [that] you have a special burden to represent people like you. When I’m the queer guy, I don’t want to leave the black guy behind. And when I’m black, I don’t want to leave my queer identity,” he said.
“Still, I like to carry that burden because it means I have the power to change people’s minds,” Bryant added.
Shanti S. Kris ’12, a GLOW co-facilitator and QSA board member, said that the core purpose of GLOW is to challenge such assumptions and create a safe space.
“The idea is to build a family outside of our traditional families and our traditional community,” she said. “This is an opportunity for people who are not comfortable or have been rejected from racial and ethnic groups to form new bonds, to find new people who can provide support and acceptance.”
Garcia said that while creating an area of support—rather than pursuing political goals—is GLOW’s main objective, he hopes that the presence on campus of a group that addresses intersections of identity will foment a desire to make a difference.
“By inserting cultural identities into queer identities and queerness into cultural identities, GLOW is creating a stronger potential to mobilize and to effect change,” Garcia said. “We’re bringing a face to a community that has been forced to hide itself.”
While GLOW’s meeting times and locations are confidential, GLOW’s co-facilitators said that those interested in attending should contact them.

The Allston Work Team will present a set of recommendations for Harvard’s $1 billion expansion in Allston by the middle of next year, according to University Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp.
But what shape those recommendations will take—or how specific they will be—remains unclear at this time.
The University shelved its initial, highly ambitious plans for development in Allston because of fiscal constraints and has now started to put in place a new set of objectives. Lapp, who is responsible for overseeing the project’s future, has not specified what the new plan will entail.
“The progress made to date suggests that by mid-2011, the Work Team will be able to bring recommendations to University leadership,” Lapp wrote in a statement.
Construction in Allston has been frozen since December 2009. Allston residents have said they have felt excluded from the planning process.
“No one in Allston or Brighton has any idea how that planning process is going,” Allston resident Harry Mattison said. “Harvard has been incredibly opaque about the whole thing. Maybe it’s because they have nothing to tell us.”
The City of Boston is also anxious to see a resumption of construction on Harvard’s Allston properties, which will largely be dedicated to science research.
“Harvard is aware of our hopes to see the Science Complex construction resume as soon as possible, and we are pleased that they have hired a couple of real estate firms to seek a development partner,” wrote Bos
ton Redevelopment Association spokesperson Jessica Shumaker in an e-mailed statement.
Harvard’s planning efforts have been occurring under the auspices of the Allston Work Team which, according to Lapp, has “been focused on analyzing ways in which the University’s growth needs can be addressed, structurally as well as financially, with a program that fully integrates a vision for Allston.”
To this end, the Work Team has visited peer institutions engaged in similar construction projects, hosted a panel discussion with real estate experts, and, most recently, hired external development consultants Leggat McCall and McCall & Almy to advise on current market conditions.
With the input of its consultants, the Work Team is considering developing the property in stages or possibly co-developing the property with another private institution, according to Lapp.
“[The consultants] are helping us figuring out a staged process, what’s viable today, what’s the next step,” Lapp said in an interview earlier this month.
University President Drew G. Faust created the Work Team to advise on the University’s development in Allston in the wake of last December’s indefinite halt on construction on the Allston Science Complex.
Faust declined to comment for this story.
Construction of the Science Complex—a $1 billion project billed as a mecca of stem cell research and the nexus of Harvard’s Allston campus—was stopped due to economic constraints caused by the financial crisis.

The current direction of research on autism may have a detrimental effect on the treatment and quality of life for individuals with the condition, according to a panel discussion at Harvard Law School yesterday.
Current researchers often investigate autism through the lens of genetics but fail to also consider the many physiological manifestations of the disorder, according to Isaac S. Kohane, a Harvard Medical School associate professor in the Harvard-MIT Health Sciences and Technology program. These two realms often remain distinct, consequently hindering progress in autism research, Kohane said.
Genetic research has made great strides in recent years—in fact, Kohane’s lab identified a group of genetic variations that allow scientists to predict whether an individual has autism with 70 percent accuracy. Despite these advances, Kohane said that researchers need to branch out to different aspects of the disorder. He pointed to the inflammation in the brain, blood, and spinal fluid as an understudied symptom of autism.
Assistant Law Professor I. Glenn Cohen, who co-directs the Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, provoked debate when he broached the question of whether genetic research should be used to screen for autism and eradicate the condition.
Ari Ne’eman, founding president of the Autistic Self-Advocacy Network and the only panelist on the autism spectrum, said that the autistic community takes offense at the idea of eradicating autism.
“If you look at the last 30 years of dialogue about autism, the question has not been, ‘How do we make a better world for people with autism,’ but ‘How do we make a world without people with autism,’” said Ne’eman, who added that autism should be viewed as a disability rather than a disease.
Ne’eman’s sentiments resonated with audience member Linda Tieh, a student at the Law School who said she worked with an autistic child as a high school student.
“Sometimes you don’t really discover a special talent or ability that they have. I was lucky enough to see that [the autistic child she worked with] had a knack for music. He could play music by ear,” she said.
“But if he heard the music with mistakes in it, then he would play it with the same mistakes, and he would not unlearn those mistakes,” Tieh added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Social spaces and administrative barriers for student groups throwing parties remain some of the problems with social life at Harvard, according to participants at last night’s Undergraduate Council-led dinner discussions on social life.
The two discussions, which were held simultaneously in Pforzheimer and Eliot Houses, each attracted about 10 students interested in brainstorming ways to change the social scene at Harvard.
Organized by the UC’s newly-formed Social Life Task Force, the discussions aimed to help the task force formulate questions for the Council’s upcoming survey on social life.
After hosting similar events this Sunday in Mather House and next Monday in the Straus Hall Common Room, the task force expects to send a final survey to students early next week, according to task force chair Matthew S. Coe-Odess ’12.
“It’s understood that Harvard social life needs to be improved and that large groups of students are unhappy,” Coe-Odess said.
While UC President Johnny F. Bowman ’11 said that the issues brought up at the discussions—including social space—were not “surprising,” the events will still help the UC tailor the survey questions to student interest.
“We had addressed a lot of the points that were talked about, but it’s good to hear from people outside the UC—that they’re thinking about the same issues that we are,” Bowman said.
Coe-Odess also said he was not surprised by the attendees’ emphasis on social space. Many expressed frustration at the difficulties that students and clubs without real estate have in finding places to host parties, and the lack of space for individuals to branch out socially after freshman year.
“At other colleges, there are more opportunities for spontaneous interactions to meet people,” said Ilya Chalik ’11. “[At Harvard] there’s the Science Center. There’s Greenhouse Cafe, where everyone’s constantly typing on their laptops, finishing a problem set.”
Other issues that attendees focused on included the role of House life in defining students’ social experiences and the administrative red tape that prevents students from taking advantage of available spaces such as the Lowell Grille.
“We need the administration to want us to have a good time,” Coe-Odess said.
After the survey, the task force plans to hold more informal discussions and a larger symposium to share the results with students and continue the discussion of social life on campus.
“We really want students to know what their peers said,” Coe-Odess said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Business School announced yesterday that it will embark on two major construction projects in Allston—a new executive education building on the school’s campus and a Harvard Innovation Lab in a University-owned property on Western Avenue.
The executive education building will cost between $90 to $100 million, according to HBS Dean Nitin Nohria. The building will be financed by a $50-million gift from Tata Trusts and Companies—philanthropic entities of India’s Tata Group, a conglomerate with a combined market capitalization of $80 billion.
The gift is the largest from an international donor in the Business School’s history.
The executive education building, which will be named Tata Hall, will be used for a combination of academic and residential purposes. Construction is slated to begin next spring and the building will likely open for use in the fall of 2013, according to Nohria.
Ratan Tata, the Chairman of Tata Sons Ltd., attended the HBS School of Advanced Management Program, an executive education program, in 1975.
In addition to the new executive education building, HBS announced that it will renovate the old WGBH building on Western Avenue to open a lab for innovation and entrepreneurship.
HBS Professor Peter Tufano, who is also one of the the Allston Work Team’s co-chairs, drafted the original proposal for the project. Tufano said in a press release that the lab is a way of unifying the University.
“Student entrepreneurs don’t respect academic silos, but nevertheless often found it hard to connect across school boundaries,” Tufano said. “If we could find ways to facilitate those interactions, bringing them together in an environment that stimulates the sharing of ingenuity, knowledge, and skills, innovation and creativity could flourish. The potential of a unified Harvard could partially be realized.”
The price tag on the renovation is between $15 to $20 million, and the
project will begin in the spring, according to Nohria. But he noted that the time line is an “aggressive” goal, and that it is still subject to approval by the City of Boston.
Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino praised HBS’ intentions to develop in Allston as a sign that the University plans to continue to revitalize the neighborhood through construction projects, despite last December’s halt on construction on the Harvard Allston Science Complex.
“For the Allston community, the Harvard Innovation Lab is a sign of this university’s commitment to reactivating Western Avenue,” Menino said. “The old WGBH building has sat vacant. This project will help bring vitality to that area. We all know there’s a lot more work to do, but this is an important step in the right direction.”
Menino added that both construction projects will stimulate the local economy.
“The two projects that Harvard has announced today are significant in their own ways, but together they highlight a continued drive to invest in Boston,” Menino said. “We surely have a way to go in terms of recovery from the recession ... but projects like this keep that positive momentum going. In a slow economy, the Business School’s new executive education building will generate construction jobs and permanent jobs once the project is done.”
But some Allston residents remain skeptical of the anticipated benefits for their community.
“We’d like to have a discussion with the Dean to understand his vision for Western Avenue,” Mattison said.
An Allston-Brighton Task Force meeting to discuss HBS’ construction plans and Allston Work Team updates is scheduled for Nov. 3.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
President of Chile Sebastián Piñera warmly embraced each of the 33 miners that were rescued this Wednesday, encouraging them to reunite with their families and leading them in singing the Chilean national anthem. The miners had survived 69 days in a collapsed mineshaft.
Piñera, who graduated from the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences with a doctorate in economics in 1976, has been praised both domestically and internationally for his leadership during the Chilean mine crisis, which ended this week.
Laurence J. Kotlikoff, an economics professor at Boston University and one of Piñera’s closest friends during his time at Harvard, said that the same qualities that have made him a successful leader were evident in Piñera when they first met 37 years ago.
The two became fast friends as soon as classes had started—albeit with a spirit of friendly competition. Kotlikoff remembered walking back after picking up their first exam; Piñera pointed out that Kotlikoff had gotten the highest score in the class while he had gotten the second highest and wondered simply, “‘How’d that happen?’”
“We were always being a little sarcastic with each other from the get-go,” Kotlikoff said. “He has a lot of fun kidding people around.”
But Kotlikoff also said that Piñera—who entered graduate school as a newlywed and left three years later with a Ph.D.—was a family man and a “brilliant” but humble student.
“[Other students] cared about being right,” Kotlikoff said. “He cared about finding the right answers.”
And even while studying in America, Piñera remained conscious of the political happenings in his country, according to Kotlikoff.
In 1973—the same year that Piñera began his doctoral studies at GSAS—the Chilean army general Augustín Pinochet staged a coup that overthrew the country’s democratically-elected president, Salvador Allende.
Piñera had “heated discussions with Chilean students in the Boston area,” Kotlikoff said. “He was very saddened by the whole situation.”
And though Kotlikoff said that Piñera was not always certain that he would pursue a career in public service, it was likely something that Piñera had considered.
“I think he was in many ways born for this job. He’s a good debater, but the main thing is he’s a great listener,” Kotlikoff said. “I wish he was running our country.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Each Thursday, The Crimson will compile a series of unique statistics  about Harvard's sports scene. Welcome to the Magic of Numbers—without  the problem sets. We'll do the math for you.
THREE YARDS AND A CLOUD OF DUST
158 — Yards on the ground for senior tailback Gino Gordon last week in the Crimson’s 31-17 win over Cornell.
93 — Yards gained by sophomore tailback Treavor Scales in the same game.
146.4 — Yards per game allowed by Lehigh so far this season. Harvard returns home to the Stadium this Saturday to take on the Mountain Hawks. Kickoff is set for noon.
10-4 — Record the Crimson holds in non-conference games since the 1999 football season.
COMEBACK CRIMSON
6 — Number of sets the Harvard women’s volleyball team won in its last two games. The Crimson defeated Ivy League foes Columbia and Cornell, 3-2 and 3-1, respectively.
6 — Number of sets the Harvard women’s volleyball team won in its first four games of the season. The Crimson will bring its two game winning streak on the road this weekend to Princeton and Penn.
11— Blocks for rookie Teresa Skelly over the previous two games.
SHOWDOWN IN PROVIDENCE
3 — Number of Crimson alums to be inducted into the Massachusetts Hockey Hall of fame. Bill Corkery ’73, Bob McManama ’73 and Dave Hynes ’73 were all members of the Harvard men’s hockey team that captured the ECAC title and reached the NCAA semifinals in 1970-71.
201 — Number of goals totaled by Corkery, McManama, and Hynes over the course of their collegiate careers at Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the Harvard football team takes the field this weekend, the line of scrimmage will look more like a mirror than a sieve.
After two weeks of cakewalks through featherweight opponents, the Crimson (3-1, 1-1 Ivy) will take on its first real challenge since the Brown game this weekend when it hosts Lehigh at noon on Saturday.
“We’re looking to continue building on the success we’ve had before we get into the meat of our conference season,” Harvard captain Collin Zych said.
Like the Crimson, the Mountain Hawks (3-2) have a record that tells more about their schedule than their strengths and weaknesses. Lehigh’s losses to No. 7 Villanova and No. 15 New Hampshire won’t allow Harvard to sleep on it, but neither will the Mountain Hawks’ wins over Drake, Princeton, and Fordham give Harvard nightmares.
The game against the Crimson will provide the first real indicator of Lehigh’s talent.
“Meaning no disrespect to the teams we played the last two weeks, but Lehigh’s just a better team,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “More team speed, more athleticism, coming in with a little bit of a swagger. Their only two losses against two of the really great FCS programs in Villanova and New Hampshire. They’re a good team, and they’re quite a bit better team than the Lehigh team we beat down there last year.”
But while the Mountain Hawks present a more imposing threat to Harvard’s record than did the Leopards or Big Red, this weekend probably won’t prove too much more difficult for the Crimson offense than the past two weekends have.
Lehigh surrendered 327 yards to Princeton, only 36 fewer than the porous Lafayette defense did in a two-overtime game. It could be another big day for senior running back Gino Gordon and his sophomore sidekicks Treavor Scales and Rich Zajeski. The trio has eaten up swiss cheese front lines the past two weekends and shouldn’t have too much trouble digesting this one.
“All the credit should go to the offensive line,” Zych said. “They’ve taken the challenge and responded. There are some great running backs on our team that are able to make plays.”
The intimidating ground game and strong play by the offensive line has helped take some of the pressure of sophomore signal caller Colton Chapple, who has started the past two weekends in place of Andrew Hatch.
“I think he’s doing a terrific job,” Murphy said. “I think he’s good enough to win with, I think he’s a good leader, and I think everything else that he needs to do as a QB is improving, so we’re happy with him.”
The more intriguing match-up will be the one between the Mountain Hawks’ offense and the Harvard defense.
“They have good athletes, they’re well-coached,” Zych said. “They’ve shown that they’re a good football team...offensively, they like to run the football.”
The Lehigh offense shined against Princeton, putting up 528 total offensive yards, including 392 in the air.
That passing game will likely provide the biggest challenge for Harvard, which has recently reshuffled its secondary.
“We have had a lot of injuries,” Zych said. “One of the things we pride ourselves on is the next guy being able to step in and be successful. We have had young guys that have had to step in.”
But while the Mountain Hawks pose a threat in the air, its ground game will likely be more pedestrian when faced with the Crimson’s front line. The veteran unit, one of the League’s best,  has allowed more than 100 yards on the ground just once—against the Bears—this season.
“Every week, we have a goal which is to stop the run,” Zych said. “Our defensive line does a great job, allows us to be more aggressive in coverage, doesn’t make us have to cover as long, and makes our job easier [in terms of] being more aggressive and making plays.”
On paper, Harvard seems to have a slight edge on both offense and defense. But the Mountain Hawks’ dominance in its three wins has resonated like a fire alarm in the Stadium this week.
“The way they beat Princeton, I think, is indicative of how good a team they can be,” Murphy said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The rousing chants of Harvard fans filled Blodgett Pool last night during the third quarter of the men’s water polo game against Brown. The Crimson was poised to make a dramatic five-goal comeback for its Senior Night and final home game of the season. It appeared as if victory over the Bears was in reach.
And then three unanswered goals from Brown quickly reversed that notion.
Harvard (6-12, 0-3 CWPA) lost to the Bears (13-4, 6-1), 12-9, last night in a game that was characterized by a series of momentum swings, which eventually fell in favor of Brown.
“We struggled to play consistently,” co-captain Bret Voith said. “There were a couple periods [when] we were playing really well, but there were a couple mental lapses that cost us that game. When we slowed down and slowed our offense down, we were able to gain that momentum.”
The Bears came out ready to play last night, winning the sprint and scoring two unanswered goals within the first 75 seconds of play.
They dominated both sides of the ball in the first quarter with two more unanswered goals. Brown’s defense consistently shut down the Crimson, and it was not until five minutes in that senior Alex Thompson got off the first shot of the game.
“We could have easily curled up into a ball and gave up,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “We were down 5-0 at the end of the first, but we kept going. We dig ourselves into big holes sometimes, but we never give up.”
Just before halftime, the team’s resilience paid off when sophomore Max Eliot scored despite a two-on-one battle at the two-meter mark.
The clock soon ran down toward the break, but not before Voith could score from five-meters in the final six seconds.
“The first quarter, our offense was just terrible—I think we weren’t patient enough, and we weren’t taking shots, and the shots we did have, they were rushed,” Voith said. “But in the second quarter, we took those extra five seconds on the clock. We worked to break down the defense before we shot.”
Harvard was able to build upon its improvements after halftime by switching to a zone defense that successfully held off the Bears.
“[Brown] struggled to break it,” Voith said. “We ran it pretty effectively for a quarter and a half.”
Despite a goal from the Bears early in the third, a decisive ejection drawn by junior Kevin DiSilvestro on a counter attack swung the momentum firmly onto the Crimson’s side.
In the six-on-five, junior Evan Zepfel hit the post from the left side of the pool, but freshman Neal O’Hara threw the ball in off the rebound from the set position, prompting cheers from the home crowd of Senior Night fans and freshman parents.
“The crowd really fed the boys in there,” Minnis said. “That’s what it’s really about: the yelling, the atmosphere.”
The home crowd’s excitement persisted as Zepfel and Voith each scored an unanswered goal.
But the rally was short-lived, as the tables quickly turned and Brown notched three uncontested goals on Harvard in the third quarter.
Although the Crimson scored shortly before the end of the quarter, Harvard and Brown matched each other in the fourth with three goals apiece to close the game 12-9.
For senior Jeff Lee, last night’s loss inspired mixed feelings as the last home game of the season.
“It’s bittersweet,” said Lee, who was honored alongside Thompson and Voith in the pre-game Senior Night ceremonies. “Obviously, I would have liked to go out with a win, but it’s been a good four years. We still have a lot of games to look forward to. We have three crucial conference games coming up this weekend. We’re just going to shift our focus now and see where we go from there.”

Two races, two different environments, one last opportunity for the Harvard cross country squads to prove themselves to their teammates and to the rest of the nation before the championship season begins.
The squads will be split over the weekend as seven runners from both the men’s and women’s teams will travel to Terre Haute, Ind., tomorrow to compete in the prestigious Pre-Nationals Invitational against some of the top teams in the nation.
Another group of runners will race closer to home this morning in Warwick, R.I., at the first annual Brown Invitational.
With the fanfare of Pre-Nationals comes some stiff-competition. Over 1,600 runners, including 18 of the top 30 men’s and 18 of the top 30 women’s cross country teams, will be vying for victory within their respective divisions. The field of competition will be split into a blue, white, and open division for both the women’s 6,000-meter and the men’s 8,000-meter races. The meet will be held for the seventh straight year at the LaVern Gibson Championship Cross Country Course, where the Division I national championships will be hosted in late November.
Coming off of an impressive sixth-place finish at the Wisconsin Adidas Invitational, the women’s team has earned a quick boost in its reputation, ranking 31st in the nation in the most recent USTFCCCA poll and lacking just seven votes to break into the top 30. Pre-Nationals will allow the Crimson runners to test themselves against some of the top-tier teams and raise the squad’s national stock.
“We’ve got a women’s team that is very, very strong,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “They are deep, they are talented, and they are hungry. They really want to be running at a high level, so this will just be another step on the journey that we started back in the summer.”
The Harvard women will look to build off of its 12th-place finish in last year’s meet as it competes against 39 other opponents in the “white” division, eight of which are within the nation’s top 30 teams. Although Columbia, Dartmouth, and Princeton, the three other Ivy League contenders in the competition, are all designated to run in the “blue” division, they will be in the Crimson’s thoughts as it uses this weekend to prepare for the end of its season.
“I think it will be a really good litmus test for us before we go to the Ivy League Championships,” Saretsky said. “We want to see how we stack up against some of the best teams in the nation.”
The men’s team will also try to make a name for itself as it attempts to top last year’s 23rd place finish. It will compete against 35 other teams in the “white” division, including 10 teams in the top 30 of the nation as well as Columbia, a fellow Ivy League competitor.
Although the men’s team is coming in with less experience, it still hopes to make a strong showing.
“We have a pretty young team, and it’s been interesting to see how they’ve developed,” captain Dan Chenoweth said. “I’d really like to see the guys have a good, solid race, especially some of the guys who haven’t raced a lot of 8K’s.”
Chenoweth will lead his squad as he tries to top his 8th-place finish in last year’s event. But the senior is approaching the race focusing more on how his entire team will benefit from the experience.
“I’d love to get back into that top 10 and to do a little better than I did last year, but it’s more about just getting experience before we go into the Ivy Championships…and getting a good, fast race in,” Chenoweth said.
A large remainder of the squads will enter the Brown Invitational with a similar mindset, as the results will play an important role in determining who will compete in the Ivy League Championships.
“Brown is more of a low-key environment and doesn’t have the fanfare of Nationals, but what I tell all of our athletes is that the key is putting one foot in front of the other and blocking out all of these other things no matter where they are running,” Saretsky said. “I know that training has been going very well, so I’m looking forward to seeing improvements since the last time that everyone competed from the runners at both of the events.”

Ask anyone for the biggest alumni name in Harvard men’s basketball, and you’ll probably get Jeremy Lin '10. Although he’s clearly proven himself deserving of the attention, several other former Crimson basketball players have made names for themselves off the court—one of them being the current United States Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan '87.
While playing at Harvard, Duncan was co-captain for the varsity men’s basketball team during his senior season and was the Crimson’s leading scorer with an average of 16.9 points per game. Although Harvard went 9-17 on the year and tied for seventh in the Ivy League, Duncan was able to continue his basketball career beyond the collegiate level.
The Academic All-American went on to play professionally for four years, mostly in Australia’s National Basketball League.
After his stint in the pros, Duncan returned to the United States, where he began his career in education at the Ariel Education Initiative. He continued his work in the field as the CEO of the Chicago Public Schools and now as a member of President Obama’s cabinet.
This evening, Duncan was honored as the recipient of PBHA’s 2010 “Call of Service” Award and gave a lecture at Memorial Church as part of PBHA’s Alumni Weekend. Also in attendance? Not surprisingly, Tommy Amaker and the 2010-11 men’s basketball lineup.

It’s Freshman Parents Weekend! While the campus is swarming with freshman parents, eager (or not so eager) to learn what their children have been doing the past seven weeks, most of the athletic teams will be traveling to play away matches. Freshman parents may not get the opportunity to watch many of the Harvard athletic teams in action, but there are still two key events that the Crimson is hosting at home.
The first is the Harvard football team, taking on Lehigh tomorrow at noon at the Stadium. Last time out, the Crimson displayed fine form as it picked up its first Ivy win of the season, 31-17, over Cornell. Now 3-1 overall, the squad is looking to capture its third straight victory, and if past performances are good indications, then Harvard has a great chance to do so. Last year, the Crimson defense dominated Lehigh, giving the Crimson the win, 28-14. Harvard also leads the overall series, 8-7.
Many freshman parents may have never had the chance to watch a field hockey match, but this weekend provides the perfect opportunity, with the team facing off against Cornell at Jordan Field tomorrow at 2 p.m. The women have a 3-9 overall season record and a four-game losing streak, but don’t count them out just yet. Last year, Harvard defeated Cornell, 1-0, in Ithaca, N.Y. With the season nearing its end, the squad only has a few more chances to improve its overall record, but things could be looking up after this weekend if the team manages to pull off the victory.
After tying against the Cornell Big Red last weekend, the Crimson men’s soccer team travels to Brown tomorrow night at 7 p.m. in another clash of the colors. For those who haven’t been keeping track of the men’s progress this season, the team is 4-3-4 and has not lost any conference games yet. With history on its side, that success against Ivies should continue. Harvard leads the overall record against the Bears, 46-27-11, and has won three of the past five meetings.
Earlier that same day, the women’s soccer team also takes on Brown in Providence. Like the men, the women also have a winning record of 5-4-1. In its last match, the Crimson took down Cornell, 2-0. Brown is unbeaten at home this season, but Harvard is looking to extend its winning streak to four games and has won its past two matches against the Bears.
Continuing in Ivy League play, the women’s volleyball squad plays against Princeton tonight at 7 p.m. and Penn tomorrow afternoon at 5 p.m. The women (5-11, 2-2) look to extend their two-game conference win streak. Last season, the Crimson defeated the Tigers and lost to the Quakers in the same weekend.
Finally, the men’s water polo squad takes a trip down to New York and Connecticut for games tomorrow afternoon, tomorrow evening, and Sunday at noon. Harvard fell to Brown, 12-9, in its last home game of the season yesterday. The Crimson face St. Francis and Queens tomorrow and Connecticut College on Sunday.

At the end of 2010, former Harvard President Lawrence H. Summers will return to the Yard—and he’s coming back with baggage. After heated controversy surrounding his statement that intrinsic differences between men and women might be one reason fewer women enter science and math careers, the current head of the National Economic Council resigned as President in 2006. FM hit up some brainy females and their (more?) science-oriented male friends in their natural habitat and haven, the Science Center. Some physics phenoms got feisty. Other math maidens deemed Larry Summers irrelevant. Like Mentos in Coke—FM’s most advanced science endeavor—the relevance of his past controversy had fizzled out.
Roving Reporter: How do you feel about him coming back, knowing what he said?
Adriann A. Negreros ’14: Women are smarter than men. It’s a fact. It’s pretty simple.
N. Loren Oh ’14: He’s very feministic.
RR: So if Larry Summers were to teach a class you were dying to take…
NLO: I’m going to keep an open mind. For me, to have a professor that believes I’m incapable as it is or less capable is kind of discouraging in a way because you want your professors to believe that you’re going to have the potential to do well.
V. Macarena Arias '14: I think you can’t define what a feminine brain is, what a manly brain is, and only men have this and only women have this…they’re just traits. Maybe some men have more of this, some women more of this. Maybe vice versa. 
RR: Who’s the best at science and math among you three?
NLO & VMA: (laugh and point at the boy)
AAN: But, I mean, they always help me—so it’s all relative.
RR: What do you think about Larry Summers coming back?
Ling J. Jung ’14: I’m rather indifferent.
Angela C. Li ’14: I’m fairly apathetic.
LJJ: There’s a wave of indifference right now.
RR: Why is that?
LJJ: Because, I don’t know, even if he says that women are intrinsically worse, it doesn’t mean that they are. He’s not going to stop me from concentrating in math if I want to. 
Marc F. Shi ‘14: Doesn’t that sort of mean that the university is implicitly sup—not necessarily supporting, but at least complicit in that statement in some way?
RR: So if Larry had a welcome back party, you would be in attendance?
NLF: I’d probably have homework.
RR: So you don’t agree that you’re better at science than these two ladies?
LJJ: Well…he might actually be better.
MFS: Well, okay. Even if I am—and I don’t think I am—that doesn’t necessarily apply to every single person.
RR: So if Larry Summers walked up to you right now, what would you say to him?
LJJ: Hi, I’m Ling Jin.
FM: Hi, I’m Larry Summers.
LJJ: Nice to meet you.
 
RR: Larry Summers is coming back to Harvard. How does that make you feel?
Emily K. Cunningham ’13: I think that his comment was taken out of context and has been overblown as a sexist comment, where really it’s just drawn on his opinions and scientific evidence.
Nancy L. Flewelling ’13: I agree. I have no problem with him coming back. I feel like it kind of was overblown, and I feel like it’s harsh to fire a president of Harvard that does so many good things for our community that says something that marginally could be taken the wrong way. So I’m fine with him coming back. 
RR: What do you think about Larry Summer’s controversial statement?
Kristiana C. Laugen ’13: You can’t say that about women.  He can’t be a representative of Harvard if he’s going to be sexist because half of the constituents of Harvard are women, and that’s incredibly insulting. 
RR: So if he walked in the door right now and introduced himself, what would you say to him?
KCL: I wouldn’t introduce myself. I don’t think I’d say anything. I don’t think there’s anything to say.
RR: Shut him down?
KCL: I would just leave. 
RR: Do you think you’re as good as men at science and math?
KCL: I think women are just as good at science and math. I’m in CS 50 now—that’s why I’m here. A lot of girls here probably are in it and we’re definitely just as good as men. It’s people like him telling us we’re not as good that is what’s discouraging women from pursuing math and science.
RR: Amen, sister.

This Saturday night, a rare occurrence will take place at Harvard: a party. The South Asian Men's Collective will sponsor its fifth annual fundraising (a) party effort. According to this video, proceeds from "a party" will go to "saying no...to inequity in India's slums." So be fly(-by) like a G6 and check out "a party" in Lowell d-hall. It is sure to be a party.

Flyby's not so sure what this car was doing parked in front of the Science Center, but apparently it is funded by Tata Technologies, a subsidiary of the Tata Group, which is an Indian conglomerate with a combined market capitalization of $80 billion.
Tata Trusts and Companies announced yesterday that it is donating $50 million to the Harvard Business School to construct a new executive education building on HBS' Allston campus. Tata is, so to speak, busting out all over.
