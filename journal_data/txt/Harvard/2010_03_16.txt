After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: 7:21 p.m.
Brittany J. Smith '09, the former Harvard student implicated in last year's shooting in Kirkland House, pleaded not guilty on accessory and firearms charges during her arraignment on Tuesday.
Smith, 22, allegedly gave her Harvard ID card—which provides electronic swipe access—to the three New York men involved in the shooting of 21-year-old Cambridge resident Justin Cosby in Kirkland House last May. Smith, then a Lowell House senior, was the long-time girlfriend of Jabrai J. Copney, 20, one of the three men connected to the incident.
Smith also allegedly hid the gun used at the scene of murder, lied to the police, and misled a grand jury when she testified.
“Today’s indictment of Brittany Smith is a significant step in unraveling the truth in this case, and holding her accountable for her alleged complicity in, and subsequent attempts to cover up, the murder of Justin Cosby,” Middlesex County District Attorney Gerard T. Leone, Jr. ’85 said in a press release.
On the afternoon of May 18, Cosby was shot during a drug deal gone awry in Kirkland House's J-entryway. Suffering a bullet wound to the abdomen, Cosby stumbled out onto Dunster Street, where he was discovered by passers-by. He was pronounced dead the following day.
Smith had allegedly invited Copney to campus and given her Harvard ID to the three men. After the shooting in Kirkland, Copney returned to Smith with the gun, saying that he had shot someone, and Smith hid the gun in a friend's room without the individual's knowledge, according to Leone's official statement about the case.
That same day, Smith called a cab and used the driver’s phone to help Copney and the two other men—New York residents Jason Aquino and Blayn Jiggetts—escape, and the group went to South Station to take a bus to New York, according to Leone.
When Smith returned to Harvard the day after the shooting, she told the police that her boyfriend’s name was Jordan Coombs and that he had left the University hours before the murder, according to Leone.
Smith also told the police that her boyfriend did not have the card key to enter Kirkland at the time of the shooting and that she had used her card to enter Kirkland House to visit a friend at the time of the incident.
A state police investigation since the proceedings last May revealed that Smith was present when the firearm was loaded in her room before the Kirkland shooting—contrary to Smith's testimony later before a grand jury.
Smith has been charged with accessory after the fact of murder, accessory after the fact of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, accessory after the fact to possession of firearm, possession of firearm, willfully misleading a police officer, and willfully misleading a grand jury investigation.
Smith is currently being held on a $2,500 cash bail, and she has signed a waiver of rendition, which allows Mass. authorities to retrieve Smith from her home in Harlem, N.Y. without undergoing interstate hearing procedures.
Smith, who was arraigned today in the Middlesex Superior Court, will appear in court again on Mar. 31 for a pre-trial conference, according Jessica Venezia, a spokeswoman for the District Attorney's office.
 With Tuesday's arraignment, Smith becomes the fourth person to be charged in connection to the case and the first Harvard student charged. Chanequa N. Campbell ’09, who was also linked to the shooting, denied any involvement with the incident and has not been charged to date.
Neither Cosby nor the three men accused of participating in Cosby's death were Harvard students, but Cosby may have been involved in drug sales to Harvard students.
Smith, who hails from Harlem, did not receive her diploma at last year's Commencement ceremony.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If there’s one thing that has become apparent this season, it’s that for Rachel Brown, there will be no sophomore slump.
The pitcher led the Harvard softball team to a split at this weekend’s Amy S. Harrison Classic in Riverside, Calif. The Crimson is now 4-5 on the season, with all of its wins credited to Brown.
But the sophomore got some help from her offense this weekend, as Harvard won a pair of close games against Northern Illinois by coming from behind—including an extra-inning victory on Saturday.
“I think our team shows a lot of heart when it’s down to the wire,” Brown said. “I certainly did not have any doubt that we were going to win that game in extra innings. And I think especially in really close situations, our team has a sense of urgency, and we really thrive in that environment.”
The Crimson paired its two wins with two lopsided losses, falling to Idaho State Saturday before being blown out by UC Riverside yesterday.
UC RIVERSIDE 11, HARVARD 1
The host Highlanders (10-14) beat up on Harvard in yesterday’s tournament finale, taking an 11-1 win in a run-rule-shortened contest.
Junior Ellen Macadam continued her recent tear at the plate, leading the game off with a homer down the left-field line. Macadam was 4-for-12 for the tournament.
“She made some great adjustments this weekend, and she is definitely starting to hit her stride,” Crimson coach Jenny Allard said.
But UC Riverside dominated from there, torching freshman Jessica Ferri for eight runs in three innings—though only three of those runs were earned. Sophomore Julia Moore allowed three unearned runs in an inning of relief before the game was called.
“[Ferri]’s definitely her [own] toughest critic, and we all have complete 100% confidence in her,” Brown said. “She might be disappointed in her performance right now, but we all see so much potential in her.”
Alexis Villamor led the Highlanders with four RBI.
HARVARD 5, NORTHERN ILLINOIS 4
Brown pitched four innings of perfect relief to earn her fourth win of the season as Harvard plated a run in the bottom of the eighth for a narrow 5-4 win in Saturday’s nightcap.
Freshman Kassy Shiotani, who was placed on second to start the eighth, moved to third on a sacrifice bunt from sophomore Jane Alexander and was brought around by senior Stephanie Krysiak’s fielder’s choice.
Though the Huskies  (4-12) jumped out to an early 1-0 lead against Ferri, the Crimson got two back in the bottom of the first. Senior Jessica Pledger drew a bases-loaded walk to plate the first run, and Ferri followed with an infield RBI single.
“It was good to see [Ferri] break out offensively,” Allard said. “On the mound in Saturday’s game, she struggled. The ump had a pretty tight zone, and she struggled to hit her spots.”
Northern Illinois took a 4-2 lead with a pair of tallies in the third and an unearned run in the fourth, setting the stage for a Harvard comeback in the bottom of the inning.
Macadam got things started with a double to left and was brought around on an RBI groundout from co-captain Melissa Schellberg, who is also a Crimson sports editor.
Sophomore Whitney Shaw followed with an RBI single to right-center field that plated junior Emily Henderson, who had reached on an error.
IDAHO STATE 9, HARVARD 4
The Crimson came out swinging in Saturday’s first game, plating four runs in the first inning. But from there, the game was all about the Bengals (3-13), who came away with a 9-4 victory.
Harvard got just one hit in the first inning, but it was a big one. After Idaho State hurler Nora Maschue walked the bases loaded, Macadam made her pay with a two-run single to left center.
Maschue then walked Alexander and plunked freshman Olivia Piccione to plate another run. A free pass to Krysiak scored the fourth run of the inning before Henderson struck out to close the frame.
Co-captain Margaux Black struggled to her first loss of the season, giving up two runs in the first before being chased with nobody out in the second.
Moore came on with runners on the corners and issued a pair of walks and a single before recording an out. The Bengals scored four in the second and added an insurance run in each of the next three frames.
Brown relieved Moore with a runner aboard in the fourth and got each of her nine outs by strikeout.
HARVARD 2, NORTHERN ILLINOIS 1
Brown started her busy weekend with a win, going the distance as the Crimson rallied for a 2-1 win over the Huskies.
Northern Illinois took an early 1-0 lead in the bottom of the first, as Jennifer Barnett singled home Dani Parrish, who had reached on a fielder’s choice.
But after the early hiccup, Brown cruised, allowing just seven hits in the game while ringing up seven.
“I felt a little shaky on the first day, but a big part of pitching is when you don’t have your best stuff, trying to be effective,” Brown said. “My defense really helped me out, and we scored runs where we needed to, which was huge.”
Harvard tied the game in the top of the fourth, as Shaw got things started with a one-out walk. The first baseman then stole second and was brought around on an RBI single from senior Jen Francis.
Shaw knocked in the game-winner in the sixth, stroking a double to center to score rookie pinch runner Ashley Heritage.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For one minute and 51 seconds, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team looked like it could do something it had not done in more than six years—defeat Penn.
But less than two minutes after the Crimson grabbed an early 1-0 lead off a score from freshman Jennifer VanderMeulen, the Quakers proved why they hold the No. 4 ranking in the country.
Penn (4-1, 1-0 Ivy) answered with five straight scores and held Harvard (2-2, 0-1 Ivy) scoreless over the next 15 minutes of play en route to a 16-6 victory Saturday afternoon at Franklin Field.
“We just need to know how to get a lead and push it,” junior Sam McMahon said. “We weren’t going full speed which allowed for unforced errors. It was just sloppy really.”
The Crimson struggled throughout the match to contain the Quakers attackers, who outshot Harvard 27-17. Penn did most of its damage in the second half, extending a 7-3 halftime lead into a 10-goal victory behind four straight scores to open the period.
“They’re very patient,” sophomore Melanie Baskind said. “They know how to look for really good scoring opportunities and take advantage of them.”
Sophomore attacker Erin Brennan led the way for the Quakers, notching a career-high seven points on four goals and three assists.
Brennan, last season’s Ivy League Rookie of the Year, helped her team take the lead with her first assist of the game. Early in the first period, Brennan found teammate Megan Smith open for the score that put Penn in control, 2-1.
Three more Penn scores would put the three-time defending Ivy League champions ahead 5-1 with 10:07 left in the first.
The Crimson threatened a comeback as VanderMeulen and junior Tyler Petropulos netted back-to-back unassisted goals to bring the score back within two.
But the Quakers would not let it get any closer than that.
Just 48 seconds after the goal by Petropulos, Penn’s Maddie Poplawski used a free position shot to notch her second goal of the game. Brennan took it from there, accounting for three of her team’s next four scores to give the Quakers a commanding 10-3 lead.
Brennan’s first goal of the contest came with just over three minutes left in the first half, as she took it unassisted past Harvard goalie Katherine Martino. Brennan drew first blood to start the second period, scoring off a pass from teammate Ali DeLuca.
Petropulos and VanderMeulen added their second and third goals of the game, respectively, and freshman Danielle Tetreault found the back of the net, but it was not enough offense for the Crimson to recover.
Once again, Harvard was led by its freshman class, which has transitioned smoothly to the collegiate level, accounting for 64 percent of the team’s scoring this season. The rookies will have to play an even larger role on offense given the injury sustained by last season’s Ivy League leader in goals per game, Jess Halpern, who went down with a knee injury in the Crimson’s second contest of the season against Johns Hopkins.
“There’s definitely added pressure to players who might not have felt as much of it early on,” Baskind said. “We know we’re young. It’s just a matter of everyone taking more personal accountability.”
VanderMeulen looks to be the best bet to fill Halpern’s shoes on offense, as she leads the team so far this season with 13 goals, more than double the number held by the team’s second leading scorer.
“She doesn’t back away from pressure,” Baskind said. “She’s dangerous.”
But scoring is not Harvard’s only focus, as the team hopes to clamp down defensively after surrendering double-digit goals to two of its four opponents this season.
Sophomore goalkeeper Kerry Clark saw her first action in front of the net this season on Saturday, stopping two shots and allowing six scores in over 20 minutes of action.
The Crimson will happily return to Cambridge for its home opener this Wednesday against Boston University after a brutal four-game road swing that featured contests against two top-20 opponents.
“It’s exciting,” Baskind said. “It will be nice to stay in Cambridge.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Leading by five goals with four and half minutes remaining in the contest, the men’s lacrosse team appeared to have the game all but won. But UMass (3-2) had other ideas, going on a 4-0 run in the final minutes and turning what was a sure defeat into a nail-biter.
Yet the Minutemen couldn’t find the equalizing goal, as Harvard (3-1) hung on for a 14-13 victory over its in-state rival Saturday afternoon at Garber Field.
“We didn’t do a good job of managing the game late,” Crimson coach John Tillman said. “If you have a five goal lead with 4 and half minutes to play, you should not be worried about it being a one goal game…We can’t manage the game the way that we did down the stretch.”
The final 4-0 run by UMass was a fitting end to a game dictated almost entirely by runs.
“I think that both teams are stronger right now offensively than they are defensively,” Tillman said. “If you look at UMass they were one of the top scoring teams in the nation coming in, and we weren’t too far behind them.”
The offensive prowess was apparent from the beginning of the game, as Harvard scored 3 unanswered goals in the first seven minutes of play.
“I thought we came out really hard early,” sophomore attackman Jeff Cohen said. “We jumped all over them.”
Cohen notched two goals on the day, tied for second-best for the Crimson. Junior attackmen Dean Gibbons also scored two goals, while sophomore midfielder Terry White led the way for Harvard, scoring 3 times—his first career hat trick.
“I thought that Terry White had his best game of the year,” Tillman said. “He played very well for us. He played with great heart.”
Freshman Harry Krieger also had a breakout game as goalkeeper, notching a career-high 13 saves, including 9 in the second half.
“[Krieger] started off a little slow, but he played very well down the stretch for us,” Tillman said. “He had some critical saves for us. He did a terrific job”
After the Crimson’s initial offensive surge, the Minutemen responded with two goals by the 4:39 mark in the first quarter. Harvard and UMass exchanged scores before the Crimson closed out the opening frame with another tally to lead 5-3.
The Minutemen opened the second period with a 3-0 run to take a 6-5 advantage, but a goal from Harvard senior midfielder Jason Duboe knotted the game before the half.
“At halftime we just said, ‘Hey here’s the thing—we didn’t play very well at all in the first half, and we’re lucky to be tied,’” Tillman said. “‘Let’s just win the next thirty minutes. Let’s play as well as we can play, correct some our mistakes and just play better-execute better, stay positive, stay together, then we have a really good chance of winning this game.’”
“[The coaching staff] really gave us confidence that we [would] play the way we know we can play [in the second half],” Cohen said.
The Crimson began the third quarter with a goal from Cohen less than two minutes into the period, but the Minutemen answered with 3 consecutive goals over the next six minutes to build a 9-7 lead.
The Crimson responded, off a goal from Cohen with seven minutes remaining in the third period, in what would end up being the turning point of the game.
“We had to come back and respond,” Tillman said. “Getting that next goal was really important, so I think getting that goal to make it 9-8 [was crucial]. All of a sudden we got a little confidence back.”
That score was the first of seven unanswered goals for Harvard, a run that spanned 17 minutes of play before UMass’s last gasp effort fell just shy of tying the game.
“You’re a lot happier going back and teaching and trying to correct after a win,” Tillman said.

Earlier this year, HerCampus.com made headlines on Harvard’s campus when four students launched a new online magazine for college women. Over the past week, though, Her Campus has been the center of attention at another nearby school—Wellesley College.
Her Campus Wellesley, the aptly-named Wellesley section of the site, came under fire for its “Mr. Wellesley Freshman” competition, based on Freeze College Magazine’s popular “Mr. Harvard Freshman” contest. Students from the women’s college were encouraged to nominate men from other schools to compete for the title. The winner would then vie in the Her Campus “Mr. Campus Freshman” contest, a nationwide search for “the coolest, sexiest, and funniest freshman in America.”
“Now you don’t have to remind me that Wellesley is a women’s college,” wrote Katie Chen, a freshman at Wellesley and a Her Campus Wellesley correspondent, in a post soliciting nominations, “but that isn’t going to stop us from putting forth our best boyfriends and guy pals from schools across the country to compete for the title of Mr. Campus Freshman.”
But some Wellesley students took umbrage at the prospect of nominating students from other schools—not only out of school pride, but also in defense of the transgender and transsexual communities on their campus.
Galen T. Danskin, an outraged Wellesley junior who called Her Campus’ attitude towards transgender people “really offensive,” said that anger on campus has been widespread and that a petition to end the Wellesley section of HerCampus.com has now garnered over 250 signatures from students.
Her Campus responded to the uproar on Wellesley’s campus by reorganizing the competition to address their readers’ concerns. Her Campus re-opened the contest for nominations again, renaming the contest “Mr. Wellesley First-Year” and inviting Wellesley students. Ultimately, seven Wellesley students were nominated, according to Her Campus co-founder Stephanie M. Kaplan ‘10.
In an e-mailed statement, Kaplan wrote that Her Campus was quick to respond to Wellesley’s objections.
“We are using the feedback we are receiving to inform how we approach these projects in the future, so that we can best embody our mission of serving college women,” she wrote. “Our intentions with this contest were never to offend, and we have reacted as quickly as possible in response to the feedback we have received.”
