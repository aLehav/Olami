After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Eleven years in the making, David Grand’s “Mount Terminus” is broken up into five parts that follow the development of the main character’s life. Set in a realistic rendering of the late 19th century, the book begins with the voyage of Jacob Rosenbloom and his young son Joseph—known to all as “Bloom”—across the country to start a new of life on the mysterious Mount Terminus. Though Bloom is the novel’s main character, Jacob, his father, is by far the more interesting, compelling, and well-developed of the two. Due to his early death, however, the book slowly loses its draw, which results in a novel that starts out a masterpiece but diffuses the reader’s interest in its overly dramatic exploration of what it means to be an artist and to love.
Initially presented as troubled and brooding, the character of Jacob is intricately and masterfully painted through a series of flashbacks from his unique life. Brought over to America from an unspecified country as a baby along with a pair of twin girls, Rachel and Leah, he is placed in the care of the Hebrew Orphan Asylum. Separated from the girls by their adoption, Jacob is later taken in by Jonah Liebeskind, who teaches Jacob to dedicate himself to the highest standard of excellence. Later, after a chance reunion, Jacob and Rachel marry, but Leah, secretly jealous, poses as Rachel and joins Jacob on a trip, where they conceive a child. The baby is forcibly taken away by the recently deceased Leah’s lover, Samuel Freed, who plagues Jacob for the rest of his life.
Grand’s crafting of Jacob is exquisite—he evolves perfectly through the roles of child, student, husband, lover, and father. He broods, troubled not only by his own actions in the past and the fear of Samuel Freed but also his perceived role in Rachel’s ultimate demise, as he failed to cure her completely of the mental disorder that eventually led to her death. Yet his brooding is not completely dominating—he sticks to his habits, the impossibly high standards of excellence that he learned while young. He educates his son not only in academics—though Bloom’s intellectual exposure is rigorous, the reader discovers later—but also in how to love, how to think, and how to act to stay true to himself. On the day Jacob determines Bloom has “finally become a man,” Jacob dies. His death, timed just as he “outlived his use,” as his mentor Mr. Liebeskind also did, is a perfect and heartbreaking end to Part I.
With his death, however, the book loses its draw. Bloom is a shadow of a character—brooding, but not dark; observant, but never really forming an opinion or thinking substantially about what goes on around him. He is a passenger in his own life, driven by the other caricatures of characters around him, such as his long-lost half brother, who is open and adventurous but harbors a dark, desperate side like his adoptive father, Sam Freed. Bloom’s mentor, Gottlieb, is a self-important grouch of a filmmaker, “only happy when acting as a nuisance to others.” Even his love interests—first the mute Roya, then the quirky and beautiful Isabella—take over and lead his life, not by their strength of character, but by his lack thereof.\
Despite Bloom’s shortcomings, Grand does still manage to create a beautiful and ethereal plot arc around him. Artistically talented, Bloom continues to develop his skills after his father’s death and finds his calling as a film director. Although clearly gifted, Bloom is told that in order to really develop his art he must know what it is to be in love. “‘If the creator of this sort of picture hasn’t been undone by the visceral upheaval only a tormented heart can provide, it will be nothing more than a hollow fantasy,’” Bloom’s mentor, Gottlieb, tells him. Bloom finds this with Isabella, who shows Bloom how to truly see as an artist should. She offers him a new perspective—physically, by demonstrating the use of an invertiscope that allows the user to see “in reverse” and revolutionizes Bloom’s perception of the world, and intangibly, by causing him to fall in love with her. Bloom is finally able to reconcile his worldview with the way in which he views his art, and afterward, he prefers to look at everything through the invertiscope. This effective passage brings Grand’s mission to express what it means to be an artist full circle.
Though the latter portion of the book has a moving story and creates a beautiful image of love and artistry, Bloom’s life—and thus the plot—feels hollow after Grand’s depiction of the life and character of Jacob. His ingenuity in creating Jacob is unfortunately the demise of “Mount Terminus,” as the rest of the characters and plot pale in comparison to the complexity of Jacob Rosenbloom. “Terminus” is, ultimately, a masterpiece that almost was.

“Modern [dance] is kind of like a catch-all,” says Julia K. Cataldo ’15, co-director of the Harvard-Radcliffe Modern Dance Company. The group, which according to its website is the longest-running student dance company on campus, promotes inventive performances and numerous dance styles.
 
Through its focus on modern dance, the company synthesizes performances that include everything from classical dance to hip-hop. “While we’re based in very quantified dance techniques, there’s an element of innovation and creative freedom,” past co-director Jun Shepard ’14 says.
 
“[Modern dance] gives you the freedom to move in new ways and use a toolbox of things from ballet and other styles to…do things that are different,” Cataldo says. In the case of the HRMDC, experimentation comes not only from the dancers’ chosen form but also from the characters of the dancers themselves. The group is diverse, attracting people with different levels of past experience and including a few graduate and fellowship students in addition to the undergraduates who compose most of the company.
 
Even the current co-directors represent the company’s variety. Cataldo is a former competition dancer who never participated in a dance company before joining the HRMDC. Co-director Hannah S. Firestone ’16 started dance in high school and had little training. “We’re not looking for technique, but if [the dancer] can offer something to the company, that is what we’re looking for,” Shepard says.
 
 “The modern dance company is really open-minded, welcoming, [and] encouraging,” Firestone says. Company events reinforce this open environment—members participate in weekly company classes taught by well-established dancers, including Johnny McMillan from the acclaimed Chicago-based company Hubbard Street Dance. The classes are a chance to learn new techniques and also to explore and grow as a group.
 
“You just get a group of people in a room together with music…and that’s a very liberating thing,” says company member and choreographer Elizabeth A. Melampy ’16. Cataldo agrees: “Seeing how someone else moves informs you how you’d move,” she says.
 
Beyond company classes, HRMDC spends the majority of the semester preparing a performance. Each term’s show consists of pieces choreographed by guests and students and serves as an opportunity to showcase members’ talents. “A lot of our members don’t have extensive dance training, but when they’re given the opportunity to choreograph, they have more creative ideas than anyone who has had extensive training,” Shepard says.
 
“For me, personally, [choreography] is very music-based,” Melampy says. “Then through a process of seeing my dancers in the room, listening to the song, and envisioning the piece conceptually, it blossoms up from there.” 
 
Through the choreographers’ thought and precision, the shows become a forum of unrestricted expression—everything that the group represents. Firestone describes one performance from “Mosaic,” the company’s most recent show. “We had a piece that used a video of these geometric shapes and the video playing in background as the piece was happening,” she says. “So the dancers were doing movement that was kind of geometric to communicate with the video…. It was also about the dancers interacting with each other, using each other’s bodies to…respond to one another.”
 
This semester’s main performance is titled “Enough Space.” The new venue, Farkas Hall, is  significantly larger than the Loeb Experimental Theater where “Mosaic” was performed, providing the choreographers the opportunity to work on a new stage with an interesting concept. “The theme is more conceptual than literal,” Melampy says. Whereas in “Mosaic,” the choreographers and dancers drew inspiration from tangible artwork, “Enough Space” deals with the performers’ manipulation and perception of the space around them. 
 
Beyond performance, the company hopes to reinforce its current goals of free expression and exploration of unique concepts. “I would really like to continue to push the company to experiment with some more of these themes…just as an experiment to see how that pushes the choreography and the dancing,” Firestone says. “We can give shows more cohesiveness and hopefully in so doing make it even more of a closer community.” Shepard is confident about the direction the company is taking. “There’s a lot of power that is just starting to emerge from this community,” she says. “There’s a lot of potential.” 
 
To its members, the company has a significant place in their personal lives as well as their artistic ones. Many members express the strength of the friendships formed and the support they have found. “Everybody in the company shares this common bond and love of dance,” Cataldo says. “It’s something I was really looking for in college, to find that thing outside of academics that would really give meaning to other things.”

Novelist, poet, and Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Achy Obejas visited Harvard on Thursday, Feb. 20 to talk about her novel “Days of Awe.” Born in Havana and raised in Indiana, Obejas has written about her Cuban origins and issues of race, gender, sexuality, and economic inequality. The morning after her lecture, Obejas sat down with The Crimson to discuss her life and work.
 
The Harvard Crimson: Your novels “Days of Awe” and “Memory Mambo” both feature female Cuban-American protagonists—how much of yourself do you see in those characters?
 
Achy Obejas: I think every writer writes from a place inside themselves. There’s some sort of reflection of them not just in their protagonists but in every character in some way or another. But I’m interested in both Cuba as a real place and as a kind of metaphor for power and for powerlessness, for private and public identity. I think in the U.S. we have this idea of agency, and we think we are masters of our own fate. But there really are circumstances beyond people’s control. Some of them are so-called acts of God, but some of them are very human-made—things like revolutions and political circumstances. Those are defining moments that you don’t necessarily seek, but fate seeks you out.
 
THC: You identify as lesbian, and you and your wife welcomed a son in late 2011—how has that aspect of your identity influenced your writing?
 
AO: I think that particular influence is probably waning a little bit, in part because of the normalization of families like ours. When I was in my earlier twenties, the notion of being a lesbian, especially in Indiana, was a very outlaw-ish sort of thing. And it was a very political time—in the ’70s there was a lot of conversation about...the notions of power inherent in patriarchy and masculinity. So it was important, and I think my work was drenched in it. But being queer is not nearly as special now as it used to be. The truth of the matter is that in my day-to-day life—when I walk into the 7-Eleven—my queerness is not an issue. What’s more likely an issue is if they hear me speaking Spanish, or my wife and kid walk in and the clerk tries to decipher our relationship.
 
THC: Do you feel a responsibility to address those issues in your writing?
 
AO: I don’t feel the responsibility to address any issue in my writing. I feel a responsibility to respond to whatever muses have lighted on my shoulder. And because of who I am and how I engage with the world, certain issues come up. But I don’t feel a responsibility to uplift anybody or teach anybody or reflect anybody. I think those things might happen, but I don’t sit down with that goal.
 
THC: Though you’ve published many creative works, you’re also an accomplished journalist. Do you approach the two forms of writing differently, and do you consider yourself more of a creative writer or more of a journalist?
 
AO: At this point of my life I’m much more of a creative writer than a journalist. At one point I was much more of a journalist than I was a creative writer: I worked for more than a decade for the Chicago Tribune, and I did a lot of alternative journalism before that. Journalism by design is different from creative work; you have to deal with real material. You are really anchored to the actuality of what people said, what actually took place. But that kind of so-called limitation I find really freeing because then you know exactly what the playing field is.
 
THC: You’ve also taught at various points in your career—is there something particular about teaching writing as opposed to the act of writing itself?
 
AO: The first few times I taught, it was actually a struggle. I didn’t really know what I was doing. Then I got hired as a writer-in-residence at the University of Chicago, and my students were extraordinary. They were so smart, and they were so creative, and they were so full of ideas and vigor, and they were so incredibly interested. And what ended up happening is that in the process of...teaching, I ended up having to think about things in a variety of ways that I’d never consciously thought about. I always tell people my writing has gotten a million times better since I started teaching, because...I’m constantly stimulated and confronted with ideas and possibilities that I would not come up with on my own. [In a writing group] you give feedback only because you really want feedback on your work. But a classroom is very different. It’s a more generous and open space.

Smoke rises from the streets of ancient Pompeii. A low rumbling sound can be heard in the distance. The ground quakes, displacing colorful bazaar carts filled with goods left and right. Could this be the work of the gods? Nope. It’s Mt. Vesuvius, the volcano erupting on the outskirts of the city and threatening the lives of every citizen in a 20-mile radius. Though this shouldn’t be a spoiler for anybody who has ever skimmed a history book, Pompeii tries to play up the suspense before the eruption in order to prop up its main storyline, which focuses on outcast Celtic gladiator Milo’s (Kit Harington) attempt to save his true love, Cassia (Emily Browning), before the city is reduced to ash. There are triumphant moments in the movie that are entertaining to watch, but they are few and far between—scattered like debris on the ruins of what could have been a captivating film.
This is not to say that the film is not visually interesting. Director Paul Anderson’s decision to screen the film in 3D injects life into the movie’s setting. The audience can almost feel wisps of smoke curl up from the streets of Pompeii, which give way to flaming debris from Vesuvius and a massive tidal wave from the sea. While there are the cliché 3D moments where rocks and dust seem to fly out at the audience, it is the subtle touches (like the soft fluttering of a curtain) that fascinate. These intricate effects make the movie’s weak plot tolerable and give its setting an added layer of depth.
  The tidal wave that sinks half of the city is about as deep as Pompeii’s plot ever gets. The issue here is that the film never quite commits to a genre—it wants to be “Gladiator,” “300,” and “The Day After Tomorrow” all at the same time. In addition to saddling the audience with the trite lovers-escaping-from-the-city plotline (will they get out in time?!), the film also pushes two subplots. One involves Milo’s friendship with fellow gladiator/slave Atticus (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) and their attempt to fight for their freedom in the context of shifting Roman political agendas. The other involves a deal Cassia’s father tries to make with a Roman senator to get more money for Pompeii so that they can spruce up their aqueducts, not knowing that the Senator made advances on his daughter when she was in Rome. 
Unfortunately, neither subplot is interesting enough to care about on its own because each is only touched upon in a cursory manner before being interrupted by the wrath of Vesuvius. Other than Milo, the other characters in the movie are never developed enough to become anything more than accessories in Milo’s storyline, which is weak to begin with. Akinnuoye-Agbaje and Harington deliver their performances with conviction, but neither can overcome the laziness of the writing in the script. This is evidenced by the movie’s main premise: Milo and Cassia fall madly in love after about one and a half days of knowing each other and barely speak before the city is buried in volcanic debris. Though suspension of disbelief is key to enjoying most movies, having to swallow this storyline is insulting.
  Even the movie’s visual beauty and moments of clarity in the plot cannot dig Pompeii out of its grave. The film gets dragged down by tedious tropes—like the rich girl falling for the slave boy because he “makes [her] feel alive”—which introduces an unforgivable cheesiness to the plot and reduces the film to a nicely-illustrated recounting of a volcanic eruption that takes up an entire 45-minute sequence. Not interesting enough to be a period-piece drama and not suspenseful enough to be a good natural disaster film—the suspense has been lost in the almost 2000 years since the eruption—Pompeii fails to rise to the level of its much more complex predecessors and is instead reduced to rubble.

Sampling has become hugely popular in the music industry, and its ability to inspire inventive tracks has earned it the respect of artists and critics alike. However, the outdated nature of the laws governing sampling as well as widespread ignorance or interpretation of these laws has landed numerous artists in hot water and stands to hinder future innovation.
 
For all of the critiques that detractors love to hurl his way, Kanye West is not often accused of unoriginality. Neither does his name frequently find itself preceding the words “is representative of” unless the phrase that follows is also “Kanye West.” However, rap’s most publicized (but not only) self-styled god has recently found himself embroiled in a controversy in which both of these labels have been appended to him. In December, West was sued by former child star Ricky Spicer for unauthorized use of Spicer’s track “Bound” in West’s recent “Bound 2.” According to Spicer, West  not only neglected to navigate the proper legal channels to obtain usage of “Bound,” but also failed to let Spicer know after the fact that he had used his track.  
The jury is still out on West’s innocence, but his latest legal troubles are representative of a longstanding trend in the music industry: sampling. 
Sampling is the process of reconstituting pieces of one artist’s pre-existing music for use in another artist’s new track. Disreputable as the concept may sound, it is immensely popular and can be completely legal. Sampling has gained the approval of artists and critics alike, and at Harvard, professors and students with a stake in the conversation are varied in the specifics of their opinions but united in the notion that there is real value in the practice. But while the artistic community sees sampling as an innovative device that should be continued, the law has lagged behind, creating a legal gray area that interferes with artistic innovation.
 
MUSICAL SNARES 
The labyrinthine nature of the laws surrounding sampling is well illustrated by the history of Michael Jackson’s monumental  “Wanna Be Startin’ Somethin’.” 
That seminal funk-pop track famously ends with the nonsense chant “mama-say mama-sa mama-ku-sa.”  As it turns out, the chant did not originate with the King of Pop. It was borrowed from a song by Cameroonian saxophonist Manu Dibango. Jackson modified the original Duala of Dibango’s lyrics to create his characteristic earworm chant of nonsense words. However, Jackson did not do this without obtaining official approval from Dibango and paying him a hefty sum. Years later, pop star Rihanna wanted to pay homage to one of her own musical inspirations and contacted Jackson seeking approval to use his version of the chant in her track “Don’t Stop the Music.”


Jackson approved, but the Barbadian songstress soon found herself blindsided by litigation when Dibango sued her and Jackson for unauthorized use. While Rihanna got Jackson’s approval to use his version of the chant, which differed from Dibango’s original, Dibango held that Jackson did not have the legal standing to assent to Rihanna’s usage. The case was settled out of court, and Dibango received an undisclosed settlement.
This episode of multi-generational sampling is emblematic of the nuances of the system. It is possible to sample legally, but many artists are not cognizant of the laws regarding sampling or do not understand their scope.
 
A COMPLEX HISTORY
Although sampling as we know it today is associated with the beginnings of the hip-hop movement, rap cannot take all of the credit for sampling as an art form. According to Ingrid T. Monson, a Harvard professor of African-American music, “Sampling is an extension of older ways of borrowing and reinterpreting. [Jazz musicians] used recordings to learn various kinds of licks and melodic ideas from other musicians. They then went on to use them as sources of creativity.” 
What is now called sampling has always been inherent in collaborative music. In fact, until the early 1990s, there was no precedent for applying established copyright laws to the practice. This changed in 1991, when the record company Grand Upright sued Warner Bros. Records for Marcel “Biz Markie” Hall’s unlicensed usage of Irish-English singer-songwriter Gilbert O’Sullivan’s “Alone Again (Naturally)” in his track “Alone Again.” This landmark case turned the field of collaborative music on its head, irrevocably wedding sampling to litigation by establishing that sampling without approval from the owners of the original copyright was grounds for suing the sampler.  
Instances of sampling vary widely with respect to the amount that is taken from the original track. Though Jackson only borrowed a short segment of Dibango’s song for use in “Wanna Be Startin’ Somethin’,” it is not unusual for artists to appropriate entire melodies or choruses from the songs that they sample. 


 In 2013, Robin Thicke was accused of lifting the entire structure of his inescapable summer hit, “Blurred Lines” from Marvin Gaye’s “Got to Give It Up.” At the other end of the spectrum, producer Timbaland was sued in 2007 for looping three musical notes that he took from a song in the 1969 Bollywood classic “Aradhana.”
The legal risks present at all degrees of sampling have not hurt its popularity. Artists ranging from Jay-Z to Jessica Simpson, Skrillex, and Cher have all utilized sampling. While the practice spans genres, it has gained a central place in hip-hop and electronica. “Bound 2” was not the first time Kanye West ran into trouble for sampling, nor is it likely be his last. As a contemporary hip-hop producer, such run-ins with copyright law come with the territory.
 
DERIVATIVE OR INTEGRAL? 
Clearly, sampling is here to stay. But that has not ended debate over its artistic validity. Opponents of sampling argue that it is an unoriginal and derivative way of making new music; its supporters hold that it is a process of considerable merit, not unlike intertextuality in literature, that allows for productive interactions between the old and the new.
Onyeka “Hoji” G. Nnaemeka ’16, an aspiring DJ and head of the Jazz Spectrum and the Darker Side departments at Harvard Radio Broadcasting, says that sampling takes considerable creativity. “If you go through [the work of] any major artist who has sampled, you can see all of the things that they can do with minor sound bites,” Nnaemeka says. “It’s not as if they’re just taking someone else’s song and putting their name on it and selling it as their own.” 
Nnaemeka, who makes his own music but has yet to sell it, says he believes sampling can help new producers learn the tricks of the trade. “If you want to start off making beats, then sampling is the way to go,” he says. However, he acknowledges that the situation is different for artists trying to make a profit. “If I ever got to a place that I was willing to sell, something would have to change…. I’d keep sampling though.” 
When amateur beatmaker and former department head at WHRB Parker M. Crane ’13 began selling his music, the legal implications of sampling were enough to make him give up the practice. “There’s a high cost to clearing to a sample,” he says. “There’s all sorts of paper work that you have to go through.” Now when Crane wants to sample a track, he brings in musicians and recreates it legally from scratch. 
Crane also stresses that not all sampling is created equal. “When someone takes the hook of a pop song, samples that, [but] doesn’t do anything to it, that feels cheap to me,” he says. “I would usually only sample something if I felt like I had a unique change to make to it. I’d remix it in a way that was creative or different from the original song, ideally so people wouldn’t recognize the original sample.”
Monson agrees with Crane that reconceptualization lends greater legitimacy to sampling. She also asserts that to view all sampling as thievery is an oversimplification that downplays the creativity implicit in recombination. In her mind, what is needed are changes in the way sampling is regulated. “The way copyright laws are set up has never been designed to reward the kind of creativity that recombining things is about,” Monson says. “The copyright always went to the composer of the song. So no matter how radically transformed Miles Davis’s or John Coltrane’s version [of a song] was, if they weren’t the composer of the song on record, then royalties wouldn’t go to them.”
Monson also criticizes what she sees as a disproportionate response of the legal system towards African-American music. “The hip-hop artists have been held more to the letter of the sampling laws than earlier in the century when non-African-American musicians borrowed African-American music and were able to make a work that earned more money than the original,” she says.  
Though she lauds the creativity that sampling can beget, Monson is not opposed to legal consequences for sampling done without permission, making the point that artists, especially aging ones who live on royalties from their earlier works, need to be paid. She notes, however, that it is difficult to draw the line between what should require payment and what should not. “If you can identify [the sample] as a song that came from Marvin Gaye, probably something should be paid,” she says. “But sometimes you can’t tell where the sample came from. This creates an interpretive conundrum.” 
Monson says she thinks it might be a good idea to form a kind of board of creative artists that would be consulted in cases of sampling-based litigation and help decide what constitutes copyright infringement. In her opinion, the current system of determining intellectual property is an inapplicable relic of the past. “The copyright system itself is based on the presumption of a classical music composition, where the work was written down by a single author. The kind of creativity we see in jazz [and hip-hop] is more collaborative,” Monson says. “The copyright system was not set up to reward that kind of improvisational creativity.”
Brian K. Price, a professor at Harvard Law School, takes a view that is less generous towards the sampler, citing ignorance on the part of artists about the legality of sampling. “I think artists are unaware of what constitutes infringement and what doesn’t. There are a lot of myths about the ability to freely use sampled works,” he says. “Sampling is taking an existing work and making it your own, and under the law that’s considered infringement [when done without permission].”
Price believes that the issue is rooted in a limited understanding of fair use. In the American legal system, fair use is an exception to copyright laws that permits unauthorized usage of copyrighted material for a limited range of purpose, including commentary, criticism, and parody. Price says that as the law stands, sampling does not fit under the fair use umbrella. “Taking an existing work, sampling it, and putting it into another commercial work isn’t one of the things [the law] captures,” Price says. “If something becomes very commonplace, then people mistakenly think that it’s normal…and legally acceptable.”
 
AN INDUSTRY MAKEOVER 
So how can we ensure that artists are legally protected without stamping out creativity?  Price suggests combining education about copyright laws with a willingness to reexamine them. “There needs to be a greater understanding of what the law allows,” he says. “There ought to be an easier way for artists who want to sample to connect with the companies who own the works that they want to sample. The price involved to sample something shouldn’t be as high as it is. But ultimately that’s a market determination.”
The last statement is something that Justin T. Ko, a second-year student at Harvard Law School, can agree with. A co-director of the Recording Artists Project, a student organization that offers free legal consultation to aspiring artists, he knows firsthand how limiting high costs can be for up-and-coming artists who want to sample. He is also aware of how unprepared to face the monetary decision many artists are. “When people hear Jay-Z and Kanye West incorporate Otis Redding into their music, it isn’t immediately clear that they paid for it…. [Artists] hear it and think, ‘That sounds great, I want to sample Otis Redding too!’ But they don’t realize the high cost involved.” 
Ko points to comments made by Robert “RZA” Diggs of the Wu-Tang Clan to illuminate sampling’s astronomical costs. In an interview with SPIN Magazine, Diggs stated, “In the old days, samples were $2,500 or $1,500…. I paid $2,000 for a Gladys Knight sample for ‘Can It Be All So Simple.’ … Something like that nowadays would cost $10,000.” 
Such high costs can be a limiting factor when it comes to the decision to sample. “There’s no regulatory system for how much artists can charge other artists for sampling their work,” Ko says. “In this day and age people aren’t making that much from album sales anyways. So who’s to say that [paying for a sample] will be a wise investment?”
Ko also believes the desire to sample is often misconstrued by the legal system. “The purpose of sampling James Brown isn’t just because the melody is great or it sounds good…. It’s because it’s James Brown,” Ko says. By sampling tracks they admire, artists pay homage to musicians that influenced their lives and sounds. To those who say artists should just recreate tracks legally with their own instruments, Ko says that their claims challenge the authenticity of the art. “[The song] is tied to a particular recording and a particular sound…. If you don’t sample James Brown and get some James Brown sound-alike, people can tell, and it isn’t the same.”
Ko agrees with proponents of sampling who claim that current copyright laws contradict their own purpose by inhibiting the creation of sample-based music. He differentiates between patent law, which does not apply to music, and copyright law, which does—while a patent is restrictive and is meant to give the inventor of a new technology a temporary monopoly on its creation, copyright laws are meant to benefit the public good.  “The purpose of the copyright act is to promote the useful arts. [It holds that] the public interest is being served by artists creating great songs, great music, etc.,” Ko says.
 
PLAYING CATCH-UP 
This understanding of copyright laws raises the essential question of how to promote the creation of valuable music through sampling while still ensuring that the intellectual property rights of sampled musicians are respected. It is a question that all lovers of music have an imperative to answer—regardless of its legality, the practice has made an undeniable contribution to the cultural fabric of the digital age, and neglecting to ensure its continued viability would be a disservice to both musicians and music lovers. The question is not whether sampling should continue, but rather, how to regulate the practice so that a legal gray area does not discourage the creative impulse.  What form this change should take remains to be seen, but Ko agrees that the view that a shakeup of the current system is definitely necessary. “Artists and musicians shouldn’t have to focus on [legal] things. They should be focusing on their craft and always making the best music that they can,” he says.  Sampling can be made to benefit all parties involved if the legal system is willing to reexamine itself. And the consensus seems to be that it should—the creativity and artistry that sampling spawns are worth it. So much of the diversity of the current musical landscape is due to sampling. Failing to ensure that it can continue may be akin to hampering the evolution of music itself.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In November, the now ousted Ukrainian President Viktor F. Yanukovych balked on a trade agreement with the European Union after he was strong-armed by Russian President Vladimir Putin into instead accepting a $15 billion bailout and cheaper natural gas badly needed for the flailing economy.
Then the protests began. And now Yanukovych is out—fleeing the capital Kiev on Saturday after an interim deal with opposition leaders signed on Friday fell through. The president’s ouster came after one of the deadliest weeks in decades for Ukraine: At least 77 were killed in clashes with police, who allegedly used snipers and machine guns to suppress the anti-government protestors in Independence Square.
Now a coalition of opposition leaders have coalesced the powers of the government into the new parliament speaker, Oleksandr Turchynov, who found the president unable to fulfill his duties and has rightly repealed most of the strict “anti-protest” laws that limited freedom of speech, press, and assembly. His close ally, the jailed former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, was also freed on Saturday.
But now should not be the time for retribution. The election, set for May 25, must be carried out fairly, freely, and expeditiously. The most important objective for the transitional government ought to maintaining the country’s unity.
Ukraine is already a divided country. Western Ukraine, which speaks the official language of Ukrainian, is more pro-European, and strongly supported Tymoshenko in the 2010 elections. Eastern Ukraine is heavily Russian speaking and overwhelmingly voted for the pro-Russian Yanukovych.
That fragile union is under great strain: Yanukovych last gave an interview in the eastern city of Kharkiv, where he denounced the latest developments as “vandalism, banditism, and a coup d’état” and tried rallying his supporters against the opposition government.
The best way for the Turchynov government to resist these machinations is to simply focus on restoring fair democratic rule to a notoriously corruption-plagued country. Protestors seized a lavish presidential palace over the weekend, replete with luxuries like a private zoo and private golf course. Yanukovych’s son rose from a simple dentist to one of the richest men in the country during his father’s tenure in office.
The country’s endemic corruption remains the greatest barrier for a bailout package prepared by the International Monetary Fund. Accepting the long-delayed loan would both help restore the failing economy and move Ukraine out of the geopolitical intimidation of Russia.
But a stable economy requires a stable government—one that can only be achieved by a speedy return to democratic rule.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Princeton Mom is back, and we didn’t miss her.
Susan Patton’s most recent Wall Street Journal op-ed advises college women to stop gorging on Japanese takeout and get hitched to elite male classmates before their biological clocks melt like Dali paintings. A sequel to her March 2013 Letter to the Editor, which earned Patton a book deal, her latest piece has provoked a bevy of humorous and outraged responses along the lines of: “Could you back off the rampant gender stereotyping for a second?”
I didn’t miss Patton. But that’s not because she’s a particularly shocking pundit in pop-culture gender politics. I didn’t miss Princeton Mom because she’s just one voice in a chorus of commentators fixated on the sexualities and marriage prospects of college women and recent graduates. Boldly covering such pressing topics as the demise of courtship, female horror at “hookup culture,” and the plight of women “alone on Valentine’s Day, staring down a George Clooney movie over a half-empty pizza box,” these pieces all concern themselves with how women’s academic and professional gains are affecting heterosexual relationships. Rather than consider the full diversity of college women and their experiences, the pieces tend to focus on white middle-and-upper-class women—those disproportionately likely to go to college. They neglect the stories of women who are struggling in school, even though almost half of students who enroll in college programs fail to obtain degrees within six years. Finally, these stories spotlight students from prestigious institutions, such as the Ivies and their peers.
Only 38.7 percent of working-age Americans hold two or four year degrees—a figure that includes substantial disparities across class and racial lines. So why are we obsessed with the sex lives of college women?
On one level, it’s a matter of sensationalism: tales of the decaying morals of ladies at elite universities are sexy. Take Kate Taylor’s July 2013 New York Times article, “Sex On Campus: She Can Play That Game Too,” which profiles driven University of Pennsylvania women as they perform cost-benefit analyses, have casual sex, and do other things that make virile gentlemen hot under the collar. Taylor’s language plays into this, emphasizing her subjects’ conventional prettiness: the women she describes as engaging in “hookup culture” are “slim and pretty,” or “athletic,” “blond,” and “pink-cheeked.” The article’s accompanying photograph features a pair of bare, light-skinned legs on rumpled sheets. Taylor can play, indeed.
But there’s something else going on here. In her incisive send-up of the genre on Slate, Anna North suggests that “women’s stories” like Taylor’s reflect moral panic about the relationship between middle-class female success, and the supposed downfall of the family. And it’s a genre of writing that has prompted numerous feminist responses. But all this point and counterpoint on the sexual mores of the new female elite obscure a broader issue: while some women are achieving as never before, for many women, the economy is failing.
America’s socioeconomic makeup is shifting—and women are achieving more than ever. At first, the numbers seem to unanimously support this trend: women make up almost 60 percent of university students and earn more advanced degrees than their male counterparts. The Department of Labor predicts that by 2020, women will be 57 percent of the labor force.
At the same time, the gap between the rich and poor is widening. A recent Oxfam report shows that the richest one percent of Americans have reaped 95 percent of the wealth created since 2009. In the same time period, the bottom 90 percent of earners have gotten poorer. Women, and particularly women of color, most often bear the brunt of this gap. Though women make up 46.9 percent of workers, they are 62.7 percent of minimum wage earners. Black and Latina women are also disproportionately affected: 10.7 percent and 15.9 percent of the female workforce respectively, they are 15.9 percent and 18.8 percent of female minimum wage workers. For a breadwinner with a family, this is far from a living wage. In short: even as trends in educational attainment skyrocket, women are more likely than men to live in poverty.
Cautionary tales about hookup culture among college women are certainly unenviable; they can be shaming, exclusionary of students who don’t fit a narrow mold, and downright caricatures (remember the pizza box?). But the appealing scandal of these narratives masks a more complex reality: that even as some women infiltrate the ranks of institutional accomplishment and wealth, bringing changing sexual mores with them, many women occupy—and organize against—financial situations that grow increasingly tenuous. These women have their own stories of sex, and choice, and the body, stories just as vital and complicated and misrepresented as those of any coed. When we devote so much of our time and bandwidth to worrying about the sex lives of Ivy League women instead of considering this broader picture, it is these stories that we miss.

Today, Ukrainian families are taking tours across the gigantic residence of the ousted President Viktor Yanukovych, a long-standing symbol of greed and unprecedented corruption. The feeling of victory is overwhelming on the streets of Kiev. The dictator has fled, his party is falling apart, and Kiev is finally free of armed police. But the blood is still fresh on the pavement of Independence Square. More than 100 people lost their lives in the many months of protests.
“You cannot leave this square until all your goals are met,” proclaimed Yulia Tymoshenko, Yanukovych’s jailed political opponent who was released from jail the day he fled.
I couldn’t agree more. Much work remains for Ukraine in the political, economic, territorial, and international spheres.
Politically, the situation remains uncertain. Before firing Yanukovych on Saturday, the Parliament voted for a return to the 2004 Constitution that shifts the balance of power toward parliament rather than the president. Unfortunately the parliament is very fragmented, consisting of five major parties and a large group of independent deputies. Gathering a coalition to nominate the Cabinet of Ministers is a big challenge, but keeping the coalition stable enough to vote for unpopular but needed reforms is even a bigger one.
Another critical political challenge is the successful integration of civil protest leaders into a fully functional democratic government. The recent victory is not only a victory against a dictator but also a victory of Ukrainian civil society. Surprisingly, the protests in Kiev began as decentralized and spontaneous uprisings. Only after months of protests did the new influential groups like Automaidan, Pravij Sektor, and Democratic Alliance emerge as the backbone and fists of the revolution.
But not getting these new leaders into the government allows for the possibility that this victory will turn out to be a mere facelift. As of today, only presidential elections were announced for May. Parliamentary elections are planned only for 2017, and if the elections are not held sooner, those new civil leaders will not be integrated. This should be done as soon as possible.
At the same time, the Ukrainian economy is in its worst shape since 2008 and significant challenges remain ahead. The hryvnia has sunk over 10 percent since the beginning of the protests and the unemployment rate is 7.5 percent. The economy needs structural reforms like tax reform, pension reform, transparent privatization, deregulation, better budget management, and gas market liberalization.
Such reforms are possible only with a stable coalition and political will in the Parliament. Financial support from the IMF is another crucial element to financial reforms, which can only happen in a stable democracy.
Some are questioning whether Ukraine would be able to hold itself in the current borders, or whether it will split along ethnic and political lines. Over the course of my life, I have worked, studied, and lived in most of the main Ukrainian regions, and one thing I am sure of is the unity of Ukrainian people. Different politicians and external forces are trying to divide Ukraine, but those divisions don’t apply to the level of interpersonal relationships among its citizens. We may speak different languages, have different opinions on geopolitical integration, and gravitate toward different political models, but the dominant majority of Ukrainians want to live in an independent and united Ukraine. That being said, it is very important for the new government to create an environment where open dialogue thrives. That is the best antidote against any attempts to create division in the future.
Getting alignment from international players is the final piece of the puzzle. It’s clear that external forces were the catalyst in the current crisis. It started from Yanukovych’s choice of a Russian pact over a trade agreement with Europe. The West was openly supporting the protest and threatening government officials with sanctions. Russia supported the dictator financially, politically, and via its mass media that reaches a large part of Ukrainian audience.
For President Putin, the current outcome poses two direct threats: It shows to the Russian people that change is possible even in post-Soviet countries, and it undermines his goal of rebuilding Russian dominance in the former Soviet territories. Nearly all of those countries have started to dismantle their democratic institutions. Local dictators have been successful in using state-controlled media to propagate the idea that democracy is a bad model for the 250 million people who live in the ex-USSR countries.
A peaceful outcome in Ukraine would be the best argument against this ideology. But Ukraine is heavily dependent on Russia, which is a monopoly gas supplier and a consumer of 28 percent of Ukrainian exports. The new Ukrainian government has to find a way to comfort its northern neighbor.
Ukraine should do just that by turning from a country that is dividing the EU and Russia into a bridge that unites them.

The media added another fatal flaw onto the current laundry list of Generation Y’s maladies: Besides smartphone-obsessed, narcissistic, and incapable of human interaction, Generation Y is inept at romance.
In the past few years, New York Times editorials and Daily Beast articles have chronicled and lamented the prevalence of hookup culture. Most recently, Andrew Reiner wrote in the Times of the newly formed need to “teach a generation how to love.” He cites workshops at Duke and University of Kentucky with names like “How to Be in Love” as solutions to Generation Y’s incompetence when it comes to romantic intimacy. (Perhaps, Reiner muses, a grade-based seminar would aidthis resume-obsessed bunch.)
While hookup culture certainly plays a prominent role on college campuses, it’s a blatant and almost laughable fallacy to think that an entire generation of young adults has absolutely no idea how to go about courtship. Romance, as a human tradition, has survived millennia of changes in form and tradition. Surely it can withstand the rise of Snapchat.
There’s no reason to believe that just because previous generations followed certain patterns of courtship that are now growing obsolete, our generation is doomed to emotional unavailability. Even if the customs of dinner-and-a-movie have faded, the emotions behind love and dating remain the same. In judging based on superficial traditions, critics of Gen Y are prioritizing rituals over actual connections. Even if the label then was “going steady” and now is “not-quite-Facebook-official-we-should-DTR-soon-though,” changing customs don’t have the power to erode the need for human connection.
Romance is simply changing form. The average marriage may take place later in one’s life than it used to, but modern young adults still have the same emotional and physical needs that they did in millennia past. Romance is simply adapting to more egalitarian gender roles, faster forms of communication, and a greateremphasis on career-building. Just because guys aren’t pulling out chairs and kissing ladies’ hands doesn’t mean romance is dead—it’s only different. Just because couples are splitting the bill evenly to account for the closing wage gap between men and women doesn’t mean that the coffee wasn’t a building block to growing romantic intimacy. And lastly, just because we spend less time on traditional forms of dating in favor of resume-building activities doesn’t mean that meaningful connections can’t be formed over Model UN conference tables or research magazine drawing rooms.
Perhaps this change in form seems like a regression to an older generation who didn’t grow up with the new tools of communication that today are so much a part of us. But there’s a layer of intimacy even to Facebook chat, measuring the spaces between the times your conversational partner hits enter, picturing the typing and deleting as it appears in your chat box. We may have new tools and methods of communication, and yet the feeling and intimacy remains the same. Previous generations had love letters. We have Snapsterpieces. Who’s to say which is better?
If we gathered all of the adults currently fretting about the dating lives of Generation Y into a room and showed them a brief film reel of how dating has morphed over the ages—from furtive romances in the Middle Ages between adolescents before girls were traded for a cow as dowry, to drive-in dinner in the 1950’s, to casual college romances now, perhaps we could assuageeveryone’s fears about dating. It’s normal for romance to change over time. We will probably have successors who date another way—perhaps they will revert back to typewriters and formality.
Now hold on while I go Snapchat my crush.

The Cambridge City Council passed two resolutions Monday night that backed local labor unions struggling to negotiate with employers.
 
The first resolution voiced support for food service workers at Lesley University, who have complained of inadequate compensation and a lack of cooperation from University officials. 
 
Last March, the service workers joined a union for local hospitality workers to demand better pay, affordable health insurance, job security, and a 40-hour work week. But the move generated little change in their situation, according to workers who attended Monday's meeting.
 
Many of the workers who spoke Monday argued that the median hourly wage paid by Lesley—$11.06 per hour—is not a living wage, forcing them to take multiple jobs to make ends meet.
 
Randy Wright, who lives in Dorchester, said that he has been a cook for 35 years and has worked at Lesley for the last five. He told the Council that he cannot afford to live in Cambridge on his less than $20,000 per year salary.
 
Community members and students also spoke on behalf of the service workers. 
 
“It’s difficult to be proud of a school whose actions don’t line up with the values that they preach,” said Theresa Powers, a student at Lesley University. “It is appalling that these workers feed me every day but can’t put food on their own plates.”
 
The second resolution also dealt with labor disputes and expressed support for a Boston union of construction workers who tried to secure employment on an upcoming construction project. The project, spearheaded by a company called Northern Sites Development, involves the construction of a new Marriott Hotel. 
 
Cambridge and Boston-area unions have been pushing the contractor, a New Hampshire-based company called Procon Inc., to hire local skilled labor, but negotiations have failed so far. 
 
Shawn Nehiley, an iron worker who spoke in support of the resolution, said that hiring workers from labor unions promotes local, skilled labor and sustains long-term jobs, as well as supporting the Cambridge community.
 
“Procon Inc. has no commitment to the city of Cambridge or its working people,” Nehiley said.
No representatives from Lesley University or Procon Inc. spoke at Monday’s meeting.

For a team celebrating its 100th season, it’s often hard to come across something that hasn’t been seen or done before.
But in its final dual match of the season this past Sunday, the Harvard wrestling team experienced something completely new by competing at Lavietes Pavilion for the first time in program history.
Unfortunately for the Crimson, the new venue was not enough to end the dual meet portion of its schedule on a winning note, as Harvard (4-8, 3-8 EIWA) fell, 29-12, at the hands of No. 25 Lehigh (10-6, 3-8).
“It was a completely new experience for all of us,” freshman Tyler Grimaldi said.  “Although it wasn’t necessarily what we are comfortable with or used to, the big home crowd at Lavietes made it feel like home for us.... I hope we get the opportunity to wrestle there again, because it really brought a whole new energy.”
Led by a trio of nationally ranked wrestlers, the Mountain Hawks seized control of the contest from the beginning and notched five bonus-point wins throughout the duration of the meet.
“We have four guys injured in our starting lineup, and that hurt us,” sophomore Todd Preston said. “There are some young guys in our lineup who haven’t gotten to see as much experience as the guys who have been around for the past four years. It’s tough to be thrown in there and to be expected to perform at your best.”
The first of Lehigh’s bonus-point wins came in the opening match, as Harvard junior Max Mejia lost by technical fall to Darian Cruz, 23-6, at 125 lbs.
The Mountain Hawks built their lead when No. 6 Mason Beckman secured a major fall on sophomore Jeffrey Ott at 133 lbs., forcing the Crimson into a 9-0 hole.
Preston succeeded in stopping the momentum in his match to get the Crimson on the scoreboard.
After fighting to a 4-4 deadlock, Preston ran off five straight points to register the first win for Harvard on the day and extend his winning streak to six straight matches.
“I’ve really focused lately on getting rid of my nerves,” Preston said. “I don’t worry about the team score or anything else, I just worry about my match. Rather than wrestling to not lose, I focus on having fun and wrestling at my best, and that’s made a huge difference for me.”
Junior co-captain James Fox also earned a victory at 197 lbs., improving his own winning streak to eight matches.
The first period was a standoff between Fox and Lehigh’s John Bolich, as the pair held each other scoreless. Fox managed an escape in the second period to go up, 1-0.
After Bolich temporarily grabbed the lead, Fox would outmaneuver his opponent in the third to secure a narrow 3-2 victory for the Crimson.
“There was a point in the match where James had scored, and then went down by a point,” Grimaldi said. “There were 15 seconds left, but he just kept fighting.... You could tell that he knew he was going to get the win for his team.”
Freshman Samuel Ekanem registered the final win for the Crimson through a Lehigh forfeit at the 184 lbs. position.
In the 157 lbs. weight class, Grimaldi was defeated by Mike Stepien, 10-7, in a chase from behind for the entirety of the match.
The remaining Harvard wrestlers—sophomore Nicholas Stager, sophomore Brennan Smith, senior Ian Roy and junior David Ng—all suffered defeats at the hands of their Mountain Hawk opponents.
“Each person had their own downfalls today,” Grimaldi said. “I gave up too many points early on, but other people were going too hard at the very beginning and running out of energy too fast. Each of us knows what we have to work on, and it’s just a matter of applying that for the future.”
For the Crimson, the home loss was a less than ideal end to the dual meet season.
“It was tough,” Preston said. “This was our last home match and we really wanted to get the win, especially after beating Lehigh last year. Being at Lavietes was fun and exciting and good for our program, but I think that up and down the lineup, we all could have done better.”

It’s not the size of the dog in the fight, but the size of the fight in the dog.
The Harvard women’s swimming and diving team entered the Ivy League Championships this past weekend in Providence, R.I. without three of its event finalists, but that didn’t stop the squad from taking home the title for the second time in three years.
With two swimmers out due to injuries and another sidelined with the flu, Crimson coach Stephanie Wriede Morawski ’92 turned to her remaining competitors and asked for more.The team responded, finishing with 1409 points and edging out Princeton by just 25 points to capture the league crown.
“It’s the classic sports story,” Morawski said. “You take out the strong people and it puts more pressure on the rest of them to just step up. It was all about fight and all about heart. They swam with fire, they swam with passion, and they did a fantastic job.”
The divers set the tone for the meet Thursday night in the 1-meter, racking up four spots in the top 10 highlighted by a second-place finish from freshman Elina Leiviska.
“Having the four of us in finals was pretty exciting, both for the swimmers and divers,” said senior Alex Stanton, who finished fourth in the event. “[The swimmers] knew that we were right there with them, doing what we could to help get the lead. We were down on the first day, but not by much, so that starting point definitely went a long way.”
Sophomore Danielle Lee propelled the Crimson to victory in the 100 backstroke with a program and Ivy League Championship record of 52.83 seconds. Lee also won the 200 backstroke, posting another pool record of 1:55.70.
Fellow sophomore Sherry Liu continued the record-setting trend by winning the 1000 freestyle with the fastest time ever in Brown’s pool. She also placed third in the 500 freestyle and, along with senior Sara Li, freshman Daniela Johnson, and sophomore Margaret Ramsey, came in first with a time of 7:17.40 in the 800 free relay.
Both the 200 freestyle relay and 400 medley relay squads secured second place in their respective races, with the freestyle group beating its 2011 school record time by 1.4 seconds.
“Really, those relay moments are why I swim,” said co-captain Deirdre Clute, who swam the second leg of the 200 free. “When you’re in relay you’re not swimming for yourself. The only thing you focus on is winning, and when you have that type of motivation anything is possible.”
Freshman Victoria Chan took on a heavily load throughout the weekend, placing third in the 200 freestyle and fourth in the 100 freestyle. Johnson finished fourth in the 200 free, right behind Chan.
“Deirdre and I spent a lot of time trying to build cohesion among the group,” co-captain Dani Schulkin said. “We have someone cheering every single race on which is unusual for a championship meet, and I think it’s really apparent on deck. It’s just been an amazing meet, with people pouring out. You can always dig down deep and race hard. We’ve seen so many people do that this weekend, and just fly by and have some of the most amazing swims of their lives.”
Schulkin and Clute each also highlighted some of the less noticeable performances that were critical to the Crimson’s title.
For instance, juniors Kelsey Hojan-Clark and Faith Martin finished sixth and seventh, respectively, in the 400 individual medley.
“We had people [step up] like Kelsey Hojan-Clark and Faith Martin who are definitely some of our top swimmers, but [they] were not people we were expecting to win at this meet,” Clute said. “This is a perfect example of someone finding what role they play on the team and just harnessing it.”
The divers provided a boost of their own throughout, as Leiviska and freshman Brittany Wang finished fourth and third, respectively, in the 3-meter dive on Saturday.
“When you come to college, swimming and diving really becomes a team sport instead of an individual sport,” Stanton said. “I think that our team did a phenomenal job of supporting each other and holding each other accountable. I’m happy with my placement, but one of the things I’m happiest about is how we have a close knit group who is so supportive of each other. I feel like when you’re swimming for a team, you do your best because you know you’re doing it for something greater than yourself.”
Harvard’s margin of victory—just 25 points—marked the tightest Ivy title meet since Princeton won the crown in 2004.
With the Crimson and the Tigers occupying the top two spots, Yale secured a third-place finish with 1164 points.
Following the Bulldogs came Columbia, Pennsylvania, Brown, Cornell, and Dartmouth, respectively.
The Ancient Eight Championship was Harvard’s 11th overall and the fourth under the direction of Morawski.
“It really is a pressure meet, because it’s not about the times you go,” Morawski said. “Can you handle the head to head racing, and get your hand on the wall before the person next to you? When your arms go numb, and your legs go numb, and you’re willing your body to go further, you have what it takes to touch the wall before the person next to you. And we did.”

Brandyn Curry, Men’s Basketball
The senior captain contributed in a big way to a big weekend for Harvard men’s basketball, racking up a total of 26 points in matchups against Penn and Princeton.  His ability to consistently drain three-pointers and dish out assists has been a major factor in the Crimson offense throughout the season.
Curry turned in a particularly impressive performance against Princeton on Saturday night when he tallied 12 second half points to lead Harvard to victory despite the Tigers’ early lead.  This was the Crimson men’s first win in Princeton’s Jadwin Gym since 1989.
Sherry Liu and Danielle Lee, Women’s Swimming
These two sophomores swam their way into the record books and helped the Crimson women push past tough competition in the Ivy League Women’s Swimming and Diving Championship this weekend as the team earned its third title in five years.
Liu’s 1000 free on the second day of competition set a pool record at 9:43.53, a time more than 15 seconds faster than her seed time.  This first place finish earned 32 points for Harvard, contributing to a solid second day lead over Princeton.  Liu also turned in an impressive mile time to help shut the door on the Tigers in the last day of events.
Lee came through in a big way for the team, swimming her way through multiple backstroke events and setting records throughout the competition.  A blisteringly fast 52.83 split set her a new Harvard and Ivy League Championship record in the 100 backstroke, and a 1:55.70 finish in the 200 backstroke earned her a first place finish and a new pool record.  Her contributions were also felt in the 400-medley relay, in which the Crimson squad set a program record on the first night of competition.

LL Cool J and student organizations representing different ethnicities came together onstage Saturday at the Harvard Foundation’s annual Cultural Rhythms festival, which celebrates Harvard’s diversity through student performances. The Crimson sent a roving reporter to interview audience members and performers about their experience at the festival.
Namrata Anand ’14, performer, Sadhana
RR: What was it like being able to perform onstage?
NA: It was so exhilarating to perform, especially knowing LL was right there onstage with us.
RR: Did you feel any pressure knowing he was there?
NA: I was terribly nervous and a little bit starstruck, but the energy of the audience really kept us going.
RR: Why did you choose this particular dance to perform?
NA: We performed a Bharatanatyam dance, which is an Indian classical dance…known for really rhythmic, intense beats, and we just thought that it’d be a perfect fit for Cultural Rhythms.
RR: How much time did you have to put into preparing for [Cultural Rhythms]?
NA: Our group practices really consistently, but our costumes are really intricate…. It took us two to three hours to get fully ready.
RR: How would you usually put it on?
NA: Usually we do our hair and makeup first. We put flowers, jewels in our hair. The costume itself has many pieces.
 
Eva M. Luo ’08, HBS ’14, audience member
RR: What do you think of the show so far?
EL: I think LL Cool J did a good job…of highlighting how diverse the community is here in terms of Harvard.
RR: What has been your favorite performance?
EL: Well, my bias is to the Asian American Dance Troupe because I’m an alum. It’s always very great to see an organization grow. I was co-captain almost 10 years ago now. Oh my God. We were so much smaller. To see like 30 people onstage, the technical skill, the fact that there were boys on stage, it’s just really incredible. But I will have to say the mariachi was probably my favorite. Watching these organizations grow year after year has been really enriching.
 
Anne V. Cheng ’17, performer, Harvard Philippine Forum
RR: What are you going to perform in Cultural Rhythms?
AC: We’re going to perform a traditional Filipino dance. It’s called the Tinikling, where we use bamboo sticks and people dance through them.
RR: What is the hardest part of dancing the Tinikling?
AC: Probably the choreography and having 16 people do the sticks and dance together—[coordinating] at the same time to make it look nice.
 
Vassiliki Rapti, preceptor in Modern Greek, audience member
VR: My students [in the Harvard College Hellenic Society] are participating in this show for their fourth consecutive year, but I’ve never had a chance to come and see them. 
RR: What has been your favorite performance?
VR: So far, I was amazed by all of them. I think the Indian performance was so well done, and I like the fact that it was not only traditional but it was, as they said, choreography that they made themselves. The Asian performance was amazing, how martial arts was brought together with Chinese and ballet—all the traditional performances.
RR: What do you think about LL Cool J being the Artist of the Year?
VR: You know, I have no clue. I have to say, I had no idea who he was…. I think he’s a great choice. He handles everything very well, he has a genuine sense of humor, and I love him.
RR: Do you think this event embodies Harvard?
VR: At least, it is a good beginning. I wish it would have more groups. I don’t know how the process goes, but from what I’ve heard from my students is that they work throughout the year for this performance…. You can see the results. 
 
Janice K. Chan, GSAS, performer, Wushu Club
RR: So you’re part of the Wushu Club. Why did you join?
JC: I think Wushu is great for everything. It trains your mental discipline as well as your body. You have to be constantly aware because if you [aren’t], you’re going to hurt yourself. 
RR: How much work did you put into preparing for [your] performance?
JC: We trained every day the last week. The biggest problem was getting people together, but once everybody was there, it’s like the best.
RR: What about LL Cool J? What are your thoughts on him?
JC: Oh, I think he’s awesome…. For the most part I wasn’t able to watch it, but the part I did watch…he seemed like a really cool guy.

Sunday morning, freshmen all around the Yard received notes under their doors. Quincy had released the first housing day video of the 2014 season.
 
Two weeks ago, Lowell released its housing day video trailer, which is a cover of “Drunk in Love,” aptly named “Drunk in Lowell.” Adams, too, released a trailer two weeks ago, with a cover of Lorde’s “Royals.”
 
The Quincy HoCo has jumped on the bandwagon of another musical phenomenon that has swept the nation: Disney’s Frozen.
The video starts out with a brief adaptation of “Do you want to build a snowman?” with Quincy residents asking “Do you want to live in Quincy?” Even though those singing really have nothing on a young adorable Anna, life in Quincy seems pretty ideal after watching this video.
The song soon turns into a striking rendition of “Let It Go,” performed by Quincy resident Pilar I. Fitzgerald ’15. Choosing a song from Frozen is especially poignant, given that Quincy’s mascot is a penguin.
We just have one issue with the chorus, where Pilar sings, “Here with my friends I’ll fly.” Don’t they know that penguins can’t fly?

After three exciting weeks of class, it’s finally time for the semester-long academic comp process known as midterms. Although these midterms are neither in the middle of the term, nor singular tests, they are something all students must deal with—unless you were smart enough to sign up for four freshman seminars.
Stressed about studying? Confused about how to balance classes and your social life? Worried about procrastinating or ADD? Read this!
1. Think of All-Nighters As Study Tools
During the week it’s easy to say, “This weekend, I’m definitely staying in to study,” but once Friday night rolls around, solo studying is quickly replaced by solo cups. Take advantage of your bad habits! Instead of an average night of pong and Spotify’s Hipster PBR Power Hour playlist on Thursday night, inevitably followed by round two on Friday, take one night and do it big! Go out on Thursday night and pull an all-nighter. Come Friday night, you’ll be too exhausted to drink anything besides water and coffee.
2. Pop Some Addies (Advil for those headaches).
If you pulled an all-nighter and had a few too many Shirley Temples, that painful headache may be pulling you away from your studying. If you’re looking for long-term headache relief, don’t waste your precious study time taking Tylenol every 4 hours. Pop an addy and get back to work.
3. Stay Hydrated
We just watched this inspirational TED talk, and now we are all about hydration. You can’t beat H(2)-the izz-O(xygen)
 3A. Corollary to 3.
Eat Your Vegetables.
4. Pretend it’s a job interview for an investment banking firm, not for Facebook.
When it comes to test taking, it’s all about confidence, and if a three piece suit or six-inch stilettos doesn’t make you feel like a thousand bucks, then nothing will. Put aside the textbook and begin online shopping immediately. Dress well, test well.
5. State Dependent Learning
Fun fact from Intro to Psychology—thanks Dan Gilbert!—your mind is best at remembering information in the same state that you learned it. What does this mean in real world applications? If you decide to study after a few too many Shirley Temples, then before the test you should also pound a few Shirleys, and you’ll remember more than if you didn’t. Now not only do we know what Shirley Temples can do to the brain, but we also know how hard they are to resist.
6. Dance A Lil Bit Now And Then
When you’re feeling stressed and you want to shout, the best thing to do is dance it out! Nothing helps calm us down more than a little 5 minute dance session. What really does it for us is Icona Pop’s “I Love It,” but hey maybe you’re more of an Avicii or a Bach kinda person. Whatever, it’s all good. Especially this.
7. Play The Wikipedia Game
We cannot recommend this more as a way to learn some random facts and bond with friends. Here’s how it goes: Everyone playing takes their laptop and heads to wikipedia.org. All players must agree on a starting page, and a goal page to end up on. Using only links and never going backwards, everybody competes to get to the goal page first. For maximum fun, think of the most random pages as possible. True story: we just played using Maybach Music Group and Edward Wigglesworth (our dorm’s namesake), but no doubt Salvador Dali, Blue Ivy Carter, Toledo Ohio, and the parlophone would all make excellent choices.
8. Rush the New Frat
You may have heard that a group of Harvard students are in the process of restarting a chapter of Kappa Sigma. Although they may not officially be hosting a spring rush this semester, don’t miss this awesome chance to meet the bros, enjoy some excellent appetizers, brush up on your Greek, and practice those valuable man-flirting skills.
