After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“It's time to take back one of Harvard’s few large quiet spaces from our CS50 overlords,” read the details of a student-organized event looking to mock-protest a popular computer science course and its regular presence in Widener Library’s Loker Reading Room.
The satirical protest targeted office hours for Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science,” the first and only course to extend Widener Library’s weeknight hours until midnight, instead of its previous 10 p.m. closing time.
From the outset, the protest was intended as a joke, according to its would-be organizer, Dashiell F. Young-Saver ’16.
Starting this fall, CS50 students have set up shop to work on problem sets in Widener’s iconic Loker Reading Room, which uncharacteristically abounds with activity and noise as each office hours session progresses.
Originally scheduled for Monday evening but canceled before its punchline was delivered, the protest would have “pack[ed] the reading room with as many people as possible, all of whom will be studying for their just-as-valuable-classes,” according to the event details.
“[W]hen all the CS50 students come at the normal time (9pm), we will collectively ‘shush’ them whenever they make a noise. This will not stop until they actually shut the hell up and let us have our study space,” the protest description continued.
The Facebook event, which publicized the mock protest, disappeared from the social media site before Monday evening, after it attracted many comments in response.
Young-Saver, a Crimson editorial writer, said the inspiration for the joke protest came from studying with a group of friends in Widener, as CS50 students filed into the library for office hours and started talking loudly.
“I thought it would be pretty funny to [mimic them] on a massive scale and shush them,” Young-Saver said, adding that his casual conversation with friends “was never an intention to actually hold a protest.”
Young-Saver’s joke protest also spawned other joke protests, including a “Take Back ‘Take Back Widener’” event, said Handong Park ’18, a current CS50 student.
Park said he understands both the vocal enthusiasm for and rejection of CS50 in Widener.
“It’s really a matter of perspective,” Park said. “If you’re not in the class, it’s probably annoying [to have] all of these people sort of invading a library space.”
At the same time, Park said, since CS50 is a class, undergraduates want extra office hours and an accessible location for them.
Young-Saver said he appreciated the wit behind the other satirical protests as well as the on-campus dialogue they created about CS50’s power and visibility on campus and how corporations can influence course curricula.
“I think most people got the joke, and I’m glad that it did spark a broader conversation,” Young-Saver said.
The mock protest, and the reactions to it, is only the most recent instance of undergraduate debate about CS50. The massive course, widely regarded as something of a cultural touchstone as well as a class thanks to the hype surrounding it, has attracted parodies and criticism as it continues to grow. It expanded to Yale this fall.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than two years have passed since Kanye West released “Yeezus,” a stunningly raw, powerful record that marked a shift from the lush, sample-heavy instrumentation of his prior albums to hard-driving, minimalist synths. In that interim, save for two rather disappointing Paul McCartney collaborations, West has released precious little for his millions of fans, who have been left wondering how his style will evolve.
On Oct. 19, West released, via his SoundCloud account, two hints toward the answer to that question: a reworking of “Say You Will,” the first track from his 2008 album “808s & Heartbreak,” and “When I See It,” a remix of the Weeknd’s “Tell Your Friends.” Because “Say You Will” is just an update and “When I See It” is just one minute and 43 seconds, both tracks feel like mere appetizers for the main Kanye course, his (rumored) upcoming album “SWISH.” For Kanye fans, though, these hors-d’œuvres are tantalizingly delicious: The tracks show a still-brilliant West with a renewed sense of direction and signal that “SWISH,” if it ever comes out, may contain some of West’s best work yet.
Apparently, West has recently been drawn back to his “808s & Heartbreak” era; on Sept. 25 and 26, he performed the album in its entirety at the Hollywood Bowl. But the new “Say You Will” demonstrates West’s growth since 2008 as well as his trademark inventiveness. West collaborates with Caroline Shaw, a seemingly unusual choice; Shaw is a (Yale- and Princeton-educated, unfortunately) classical composer who won a Pulitzer Prize for an a cappella piece. Presumably under Shaw’s direction, stammering, affected female voices replace much of the original’s instrumental backing, though its fundamental drum pattern and electronic pings are intact. These voices begin with an ominous, quiet mania and build to a metallic, downright terrifying wall of sound, only to decrescendo to an even more alien outro. The effect is a complex transformation: West’s pleading grows in scope and maturity, trading some of the original’s sexuality for a haunted existential despair.
Like “Say You Will,” “When I See It,” a brief, stripped-down reflection on the frustrations and rewards of a relationship, marks a sharp turn from “Yeezus” in style and substance. Musically, “Yeezus” reveled in the aggressive simplicity, even harshness, of its synths. On “When I See It,” West opts instead for a recycle of his slow, drums-piano-bass loop from The Weeknd’s “Tell Your Friends.” While “Yeezus” was certainly not simple, its complexity stemmed from jarring, extreme juxtaposition, like the civil-rights refrain “Thank God Almighty, they free at last” in the graphic hookup song “I’m In It.” The complexity in “When I See It,” on the other hand, lies in its tenderness and equivocation. The minor-key, slow-motion instrumental backing heighten the lyrics’ sense of marital conflict, but the last two lines show that Kanye wants to persevere: “Diamonds in the colors of those eyes / Don’t know why, but I know a sign when I see it.” That admission of the limits of his own power, the idea that someone else has something he wants (besides sex), and the worry that he might not get what he wants are a far cry from the screaming egotism of most of West’s discography, especially “Yeezus.” Although that egotism is a significant source of West’s appeal, the vulnerability is refreshing.

Musharraf A. Farooqi, a Pakistani children’s book author and translator of classical Urdu literature, led a seminar on the function of storytelling in South Asia at Harvard on Monday.
The talk, hosted by the South Asia Institute and the Prince Alwaleed Islamic Studies Program at the Center for Government and International Studies, focused on Farooqi’s work as a storyteller in the Pakistani public school system.
Farooqi said he visited schools to share his writing as well as folk tales. He discussed the techniques he used to engage students, emphasizing the goal of engaging them with their historical and cultural past.
He stressed the importance of bringing classical literature and their modern adaptations into the classroom.
“We are not in conversation with our classics,” Farooqi said. “We have to look at the opportunity that exists today—developing, editing, and translating old texts.”
These reproductions, he said, can be used to introduce the names and legends of the past to students.
Farooqi argued for the need to sometimes rework historical stories, since some have potentially harmful social messages regarding gender, violence, and relationships. He said adapting them can help retain their literary history while neutralizing these messages.
He added that he was committed to speaking to children in Urdu rather than English during his storytelling seminars so as to facilitate a connection to their culture.
Farooqi also educates politicians on storytelling. During the seminar, he spoke about his “Leading Through Teaching” workshops, which taught Pakistan parliamentarians how to tell stories and engage children. The program worked to connect them with their constituents, and to allow them to see issues within Pakistani public school system.
Ali S. Asani, professor of Indo-Muslim and Islamic Religion and Culture, introduced Farooqi at the beginning of the talk and pointed out the difficulty of storytelling in South Asia.
“[Storytelling] is rooted in centuries-old traditions which I think are being threatened by modernity,” Asani said. He also highlighted its importance in fostering imagination.
“I am really interested in the work he [Farooqi] has translated and in Urdu literature,” said Mallika Kirti, a Harvard Divinity School student who attended the event. “It was really interesting hearing about his experiences in Pakistan and of the tensions he faces with this colonization of language.”

As editors of traditional news outlets nationwide debate industry “disruption” and new web outlets crop up every day, two groups of Harvard students are looking to add to the campus media landscape—currently characterized by print establishments like The Crimson, The Advocate, and The Lampoon—with new online-only publications.
The two new outlets are called “The Tab” and “Once Daily” and look to publish regularly online, according to their editors.
The Tab, short for “Tabloid,” launched at Harvard earlier this month under an umbrella media outlet of the same name, which has a presence at more than 40 campuses in the United Kingdom, where it was founded in 2009. It expanded to the United States this year and is now on 22 campuses, according to Alex P.W. Stevenson ’18, the head of the publication’s Harvard section. 
The publication’s website is up and running and now features a series of short pieces, which are heavy on photos, the first person, and references to Harvard freshmen. Among other headlines, recent posts include “What do you regret the most from your freshman year?” and “We went on the hunt for cocaine at Harvard,” in which several men wearing T-shirts emblazoned with the Tab logo documented their unsuccessful search for the drug in Widener, Cabot, and Lamont libraries.
Stevenson acknowledges that the site differs from establishment media outlets on campus, such as The Crimson. The Tab’s Harvard staff, who also work with general Tab editors based in New York, are looking to produce brief, unique, first-person articles around student to student interactions, he said.
“Our style and personality is defined by the people who write for us,” Stevenson said. “People don’t mold to us; we mold to people.”
Although new to Harvard, some students from the U.K. were already familiar with the publication when it came to campus. Max Mondelli ’18, a writer for the Harvard part of the site, learned about the Tab when it ran a profile of his brother, a student at Oxford, dubbing him a “BNOC,” or “Big Name on Campus,” apparently a common term abroad.
“It’s stuff you’d bring up while talking to your mates,” Mondelli said of Tab content. “You wouldn’t bring up what Drew Faust is doing with the endowment, but you would bring up stuff about BNOCs on campus.”
According to Lucas F. Hoffmann ’19, another writer for the Tab, the group is experimenting with a range of story forms, from a roving-reporter style piece asking freshmen “When have you felt the most like a freshman?” to the post documenting the cocaine search.
Another online-only publication launched this week, Once Daily, and followed a similarly drug-related theme with its first article, titled “How Harvard Kids Buy Weed.” The first-person piece begs the question, “How does weed get here in the first place?” and follows the writer’s quest to meet campus drug dealers.
Once Daily’s website vows that the site will publish one “must-read” article every weekday and do original reporting.
According to Sam H. Danello ’18, a Crimson sports writer who founded the new site, the publication developed in part with the goal to offer readers one good piece of content a day.
“[Students] don’t have time to read 10 articles a day,” Danello said. “So if you really put out one article that’s really engaging, really high quality, we think that it would be more feasible for students to read that.”
Although both Once Daily and the Tab are based online, Danello said he views his publication as following a different style, with more in-depth reporting based on days and weeks of research.
“A lot of online content today is driven, by necessity, by being popular,” Danello said. “So we wanted to make a publication that focused on topics and articles that students would read, in addition to being well reported and being well written.”

The Harvard Management Company has come under increasing scrutiny in the wake of its investment performance in fiscal year 2015. Newspapers around the country and here at Harvard have  noted HMC’s returns this past year lagged significantly behind its peers, citing the superior performance of endowments at Bowdoin, the University of Virginia, MIT, Stanford, Princeton, and Yale. Most recently, it has even been argued in The Crimson that the returns on Harvard’s endowment scandalously demonstrate that HMC’s professed prerogative to invest in any securities it sees fit — including fossil fuel companies — is illegitimate, and its continued refusal to divest from fossil fuels is baseless.
While it is true that Harvard’s returns have been outpaced by some of its competitors, calls for pay cuts and accusations of scandal on the basis of a single return metric demonstrate a fundamental misunderstanding of the ways in which investment managers should be evaluated. Cogent versions of such arguments would require substantially more data than is currently available to the public.
Before proceeding, remember that Harvard’s endowment is thirty times larger than Bowdoin’s and six times larger than the University of Virginia’s. Attractive investments of a given size, equally elusive for everyone, will do far more to boost the return of a small endowment than a large one. Comparisons of Harvard to these particular institutions are strained at best.
More broadly, a key fact to recognize is that maximizing returns is never the only objective for professional investors. Minimizing risk is often at least as important. Endowments are particularly concerned about limiting risk, since the university budgets they support, which fund financial aid, salaries, and hot breakfast, cannot countenance large and unpredictable swings.
Therefore, return metrics can only offer part of the story—they must be evaluated in the context of their accompanying risk. Simply put, there is not enough public data to make meaningful claims about Harvard’s performance vis-à-vis the schools commonly cited by the media.
In particular, the endowments of MIT, Stanford, and Princeton publish little more than a summary of their returns. Even attempts to make comparisons on a risk-adjusted basis are beyond our reach.
This leaves Yale. Harvard’s performance was nearly doubled by its perennial competitor, which returned a stunning 11.5 percent in fiscal year 2015. However, this comparison has its own problems. Though data is sparse, one can find that Yale’s target allocation for 2015 of 31 percent in private equity and venture capital, asset classes that have done extraordinarily well this past year, dwarfed Harvard’s 18 percent. Notwithstanding the fact that the valuation of these highly illiquid assets is difficult and subjective, such investments do offer attractive long-term risk-adjusted returns. That said, their illiquidity means that attempts to sell them in short time-frames result in transactions at precipitous discounts to fair value. Both Yale and Harvard learned this the hard way as they attempted to do just that in 2008-2009; operating budgets at both schools were cut in large part due to poor performance in their private equity holdings.
While Yale’s return this year looks attractive next to Harvard’s, we must remember this number exists in the context of divergent risk appetites. Perhaps Yale is just willing to take the chance that in the next bad year, it may be forced to cut the university’s operating budget significantly, in exchange for more attractive long-term returns; its allocation to private equity might make perfect sense in this case. Harvard, on the other hand, may be content with a lower average return, knowing that during crises, it might avoid similarly deep cuts to university spending. Though private equity allocations are merely a single dimension of incredibly complex investment programs, it should be clear that in general, without knowing far more about the risk-taking of the investment managers in question, it is impossible to make meaningful comparisons.
To be clear, I do not intend to make a directional claim on HMC’s performance here, nor do I intend to pass judgment on the various calls for change at HMC. However, it is certain that the return metrics widely cited in the media are incommensurable without a wealth of additional context, and that one ought not to read too deeply into the numbers that have thus far been disseminated.

The Cambridge School Committee is expected to announce the city’s next school superintendent in the coming days, ending the months-long search process that began last spring when current Jeffrey Young, who has served in that role since 2009, announced that he would step down at the end of this school year. The School Committee has already narrowed down the pool of 42 applicants, assembled through a nationwide search, to two finalists. Dr. Sergio M. Paez is a consultant to the Holyoke Public Schools, where he formerly served as superintendent; Dr. Kenneth N. Salim is currently superintendent of the Weymouth Public Schools. Both educators have long and distinguished careers in public education.
It is clear that both candidates are well qualified for the post. The experiences of the candidates speak for themselves; both have had exposure to running a school district and are intimately familiar with the peculiarities of public K-12 education in the Commonwealth. Furthermore, Drs. Paez and Salim both effectively conveyed their ideas for Cambridge’s schools through a town hall forum and interviews with the search committee earlier this month.
Either Dr. Paez or Dr. Salim would make a promising choice for the highest post in the Cambridge Public School District; however, whichever of the two candidates is chosen will need to confront a series of significant challenges facing the city’s K-12 schools, including issues with the budget and the lagging performance of minority students.
Most salient is the Cambridge education system’s budget. The budget for the 2016 fiscal year projects $164 million in expenditures, a near five percent increase that exceeds average annual growth. Already known for paying its teachers high salaries, the city also plans to raise the salaries and benefits portion of its budget by 5.5 percent. The need for financial accountability is even more pressing given the city’s sizable renovation plans. Cambridge is in the process of converting eleven K-8 grade schools into eleven K-5 schools and four middle, or upper, schools. Renovations of the The Martin Luther King Jr. School, on Putnam Ave., the first component of the city’s plans, are expected to cost $127 million by itself; for the next three years, the city will be carrying over $200 million in tax-supported debt to sustain that project and the work planned for King Open School. These costs will only continue to rise as the renovations progress; the next superintendent must ensure that they do not rise too high.
Another issue is the need to correct the racial and socioeconomic disparities pervading Cambridge’s school system. In the 2015 MCAS standardized assessment of Massachusetts public school students, just ten percent of Cambridge African-American students were “advanced” for their grade level in the English language arts, compared to 37 percent and 34 percent among white and Asian students, respectively. African-American students also lagged behind in the Mathematics and Science and Technology/Engineering MCAS exams. These are numbers that are consistent across grade levels throughout Cambridge, and while they reflect troubling state-wide trends, the next Cambridge Superintendent should prioritize addressing them.
The next superintendent of Cambridge will have his work cut out for him. Between growing expenditures and widening educational disparities, Cambridge’s schools need strong leadership. As the leader of the city’s public schools, the next superintendent must be prepared to take on these issues—the importance of his role cannot be overstated.

Many ghost stories begin with dark and stormy nights. However, masterful storyteller David Mitchell’s new novel “Slade House” begins with a sunny autumn day. In a seemingly normal London, an awkward but intelligent boy named Nathan walks with his mother on the way to a party; all seems well as Nathan bemoans the pretentiousness of his bow tie and wonders about a dead cat on the side of the road. Suddenly, Nathan notices the entrance to a building called Slade House. He opens the door—a tiny black iron door in the middle of an alleyway—and vanishes from the outside world. The explanation for his disappearance turns out to involve telepathy, a version of tag, oil portraits with eyes missing, Middle Eastern cults, and bone clocks—a poetic name for the human body, in addition to a literal object and a reference to David Mitchell’s most recent previous work. The complexity accumulated from these details occasionally seems excessive and even slightly thin thematic substance. Still, the novel’s suspenseful structure, skillfully drawn characters, and sumptuous strangeness all combine to produce a gripping and enjoyable piece of writing.
The novel’s plot is characteristic of Mitchell: It moves through a sprawling web of interwoven timelines, original world-building, and attractively complex characters. Slade House turns out to belong to a pair of twins who use their mystical powers to consume souls once every nine years, which they accomplish by projecting an image of Slade House into the mind of a human victim; each of the five chapters takes place in the mind of a different victim, and thus chapters are spaced nine years apart. Each progressive chapter produces a more elaborate description of the twins’ methods and rules. This five-part structure cleverly shapes the work like a classic ghost story, using repetition and variation to create great suspense. The individual sections each tell the same basic story in different contexts, revealing a consistent pattern in sharp jolts of surprise and recognition. Mitchell paces and conducts his reveals with skill, and—against the odds of the ghost story genre— manages to keep the results very unpredictable.
The book’s structure also allows Mitchell to show off his versatility as a writer. Each section features a radically different set of characters and kind of story—the first section recalls the fantastical, dreamy terror of young adult novels, while the second section feels like a contemporary horror film, a sexually-charged tale of a haunted house. The different styles work due to the strength of their respective narrators. Each character possesses a distinct mind, a distinct approach to the world, and even a distinctive language, all of which Mitchell gracefully exposes in their first appearances. The first paragraph of the section Nathan narrates finds his attention wandering away from his mother and towards small details of his environment. “The damp sky’s the color of old hankies. Seven magpies fly by. Seven’s good. Mum’s face is inches away from mine, though I’m not sure if that’s an angry face or a worried one,” he thinks. In only a few sentences, Nathan’s ability to see the ordinary in a lyrical, unusual light, his erratic patterns of attention, and his social awkwardness come fluidly through. By contrast, the next section introduces a divorced, rough-minded policeman. Mitchell writes, “A memory came back to me, of me and Julie popping in for a drink here one time. We were house hunting…it’d sounded all right in the estate agent’s but a right bloody shit hole it turned out to be.” Gordon’s failed marriage, dependence on alcohol, and brutal tendencies emerge in a voice utterly consistent with and also utterly different from Nathan’s. Mitchell’s best creation, though, might be Sally Timms, a compulsively likable, insecure college student with a crush. Her narrative is told in the third person for the first few paragraphs; she herself does not enter her own consciousness until later in her chapter. This manipulation of narrative focus demonstrates her extreme shyness with unusual inventiveness and precision.
The main strength of the stories lies in their mythology of “cracks” and “scraps”—the rules and construction of their imaginary fantasy world—as well as their structure and characters. Mitchell plays with the fabric of reality itself, creating new fictional spaces outside time and space: “You may find a weapon in the cracks,” says the voice of a particular ghost. “The cracks they throw the scraps down.” The idea of space-time “cracks” and consciousness “scraps” becomes gloriously unsettling and intriguing, and eventually, the mythology gains an almost scientific power in the meticulousness of the novel’s descriptions. Then again, the rules often verge on being too elaborate, a little too meticulously described. Excessive explanation can turn something ethereal into something banal, and—maybe counterintuitively—create more opportunities for weak spots in the reasoning to emerge. In one instance, the twins’ backstory fails to totally explain their mystical powers and invokes a little too much genre cliché.
The novel also falters slightly in its handling of deep thematic material: It addresses some complex theoretical concerns without ever fully delving into them. The nature of loss comes up, as do the ethics of survival—at one point, the twins vaguely question their practice of surviving at the expense of others—but Mitchell fails to expand and resolve either idea to a satisfying or original way. Then again, not all books need be analytical masterpieces, and it seems unfair to fault this novel for being what it is: a superbly entertaining and truly well-told story.

For most of my life I’d been stuck in the poser-perfect New Jersey suburb where Chris Christie resided while he was still skinny. The town had turned so Asian that all my friends knew Psy was too old, too gimmicky, and had the swagger of a real politician, two years before “Gangnam Style” blew up. Before we stopped in high school, we made yellow a religion, and if you saw me in the hallway you’d call me Bok Choy and the girl on my right Napa Cabbage, and even if we all had peanut butter sandwiches for lunch, we’d gush about Kam Man Food like it was some type of heaven, not a fish-smelling, tabloid-selling, Hi-Chew-having thing in the miniature mall right in front of Costco. We memorized nigahiga’s “How to be Ninja” until we made it classic. The azn-pryde sentiment in my adolescence was so strong it reeked. But after it had passed, I hadn’t thought about it at all, until last July, when I’d given a ride to a seventh-grade family friend and he rattled his Asian Man Philosophies the whole way to his house two towns over. I was shocked by how a middle-schooler could be so daring, so unapologetically political, so willing to marry the personal with the general.
In middle school, more than anything else, I wanted to associate myself with something—even if that something was a gimmick, and even if I had to make that thing up myself. I wanted it to be extraordinary and grandiose, as perfect as power. I thought, and still think, we were at the head of a movement that dissipated because our models were teenagers not adults, our roots were in comedy not in history, and our aims were personal not collective. It dissipated like many other attempts at Asian Pride—the cultish “Got Rice?” song of the 1990s, the young business professionals with import model pasts, and all the other suburbs in or around or away from New Jersey with yellow middle-school kids drawing mochis on their English notebooks.
I’m writing this article after watching the first three episodes of the new season of “Fresh Off the Boat,” and replaying the short cameo of Evan and Emery bringing a dog wrapped in a bow to their daughter-wanting dad, and recognizing some version of my mother in Jessica Huang, and remembering how for the first decade of my life my parents survived on four hours of sleep every night. Not many shows elicit that complex a reaction. If you compare “Fresh Off the Boat” to its 1994 predecessor “All American Girl,” which was both cancelled after one season and disowned by the Korean American community it was trying to represent, you can immediately tell that Fresh Off the Boat is funnier, more relatable, tighter, and just better. Even if both are based on the works of iconic Asian American figures, like Margaret Cho’s comedy routines and Eddie Huang’s memoir—their differences lie in a subtle change at the center of the storytelling, at who’s pointing fingers at whom.
Even in 1994, laughing at other people because you didn’t understand them was classless and unfunny. Stewart’s girlfriend in “All American Girl” quips, in response to Margaret’s mother’s “a way to a man’s heart is through his stomach,” that “actually, Stewart says that a way to a man’s heart is through an incision to the chest, a stabbing of the pectoralis major, and a cracking of the sternum,” and laughs hysterically. The joke is, of course, that like all other Asian men, Stewart is a nerd, and like all other Asian girls, Stewart’s girlfriend finds it irresistibly cute. Stewart only dates Korean girls. Stewart goes to classical music concerts. Stewart is dedicated, as is his girlfriend, to preserving Korean culture. Stewart disapproves of Margaret because she isn’t. Stewart can’t get down at a club. Stewart has the unfashionable middle-length hair parted in the middle. Stewart is a character only people with a white-picket fenced, July 4th barbequed, red-white-blued sense of America would find funny. Stewart is ridiculous.
In “Fresh Off the Boat” however, even if Jessica is exaggeratedly protective and parsimonious, the white people she interacts with are even more ridiculous. Like Honey, who actually tries to be friends with her daughter, or the principal who keeps a chick to pet on his lap. Like the other administrators who keep linking Eddie with new Asian kids at school because of his skin color, but also simultaneously refuses, when asked which one Eddie is in a room of white people, to say he’s the one that isn’t white. Jessica makes sense. She’s funny because you understand her. While Stewart is crazy in a way that is lame and all flounce, Jessica is crazy in a way that’s admirable. Jessica is the anti-flounce. While the joke in “All American Girl” was how unaccepting Margaret’s parents were of her white boyfriend, the joke in “Fresh Off the Boat” is why a suburban white kid finds the need to be punk in the first place. In “All American Girl,” the finger is pointed at the yellow people; in “Fresh Off the Boat,” it’s pointed at the white, and there is an implicit expectation that the audience is yellow and laughing along. That’s where the success of the humor lies—it was a humor constructed by Asian Americans. Because the real Eddie Huang refused to be passive at any part of the creative process; because the show has Asian American producers; because we live in an age that is more likely to recognize whiteness as a race than a norm; because communities today are more likely to advocate.
“Fresh Off the Boat” is proof that Asian Americans, and all minorities, need to write our own stories. We need to write stories with ourselves as both the subjects and the audience. We need to stop expecting other people to write responsible stories about us, and complaining when they don’t. We need to take responsibility not only because it’s empowering, but because it’s the only way we’ll make our stories valuable.
I gravitate towards my middle-school understanding of my yellowness because it was one of the only ones I made myself, even if it was immature or nonsensical or so superficial you could rub it away with spit. At that time, no one was waxing angry about Quentin Tarantino’s representations of samurais or the Deadly Viper Assassins Squad, or shooting rhetorical questions about why O-Ren Ishii had to die first. No one was complaining about Asian sex scenes in movies or blaming the model minority for why we didn’t get into college. No one talked about colonialism or immigration laws; no one even knew about it. No one cared whether you were a Cool Asian, a Nerdy Asian, a Token Asian In A Group of White People, or a Hot Asian. And more broadly, no one cared about the white-washed question Asian Americans seem to believe is essential to describing their experience in this country today—“Am I Asian, or am I American?” We simply and ignorantly refused to be victims. We did it with the defensiveness that builds after a lifetime of being othered. We did it with brash pre-teen impatience. We did it with the courage that came with having a crew. We were what we were, and no matter what you thought, we were going to write ourselves the way we wanted to, the way we thought it should be written.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 27, 2015, at 4:59 p.m.
In the opening moments of “References to Salvador Dali Make Me Hot,” this year’s iteration of the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club Visiting Director’s Project, all of the play’s most compelling strengths and most serious challenges were on full display. Outstanding acting and lushly gorgeous set design vied with faltering pacing and occasionally maudlin staging and delivery, with predictably mixed results. This production of a new and unpublished adaptation of Puerto Rican playwright Jose Rivera’s work, which ran Oct. 16-Oct. 24 in the Loeb Mainstage, did strike honest and deep emotional chords about love, loneliness, and growing apart at its best moments but too often fell victim to an overwrought, self-conscious abstractness.
“References” tells the story of Benito (Eli K. Rivas ’16) and Gabriela (Juliana N. Sass ’17), a married couple in their late twenties separated by Benito’s deployment to the Persian Gulf War. Having fallen in love as teenagers, they are unsure whether they still love—or even know—each other. Following the rich Latin American tradition of literary magical realism, the play also includes an animate, outspoken moon (Connor S. Doyle ’19), a bad-boy coyote (Derek P. Speedy ’18), and a lithe, slinky housecat (Laura J. A. Trosser ’16). Thomas W. Peterson ’18 rounds out the cast as Martin, a 14-year-old neighbor with more libido than sense.
The Visiting Director’s Project is one of the biggest HRDC productions each year and tends to attract exceptional talent. This year was no different: The acting in the show was, almost without qualification, superb. Sass in particular was phenomenal, creating a Gabriela who was at some moments tender and at others cold, whose intellectual curiosity, emotional vulnerability, and heartbreaking loneliness felt thoroughly real and human. In Sass’s hands, Gabriela’s repeated tangents into the finer points of astronomy seemed not forced but natural and meaningful, and she depicted Gabriela’s inner conflict between love for Benito and aversion to him with nuance. Onstage throughout the entire two-hour-and-15-minute run time, Sass physically and narratively anchored the play through sheer ability and unflagging commitment to her character.
Although Sass was excellent throughout, her Gabriela was most compelling when matched against Rivas’s Benito. His performance hummed with a tense energy; he perfectly conveyed the sense of an outwardly stoic man pushed to the brink. In the play’s most climactic scene, a fight between the couple leads Benito to confess to calling in an airstrike that wiped an entire Iraqi village off the map—all because his fellow soldier’s hand had been injured in a rocket strike. Rivas navigated the scene with incredible sensitivity, transitioning effortlessly from anger to sorrow to frustration at Gabriela’s response, and he did it all with an easy physicality that made him a commanding presence on stage.
The supporting cast also delivered strong performances, but in a more stylized manner that obscured some of the emotional content of their characters. For instance, Speedy (as the coyote) snarled, growled, and barked his way through his lines; the result was entertaining but often felt overdone, especially in some of his character’s more vulnerable moments. The other three supporting characters—the cat, the moon, and Martin—while similarly embroidered, felt less stilted, perhaps because Trosser, Doyle, and Peterson were supremely suited for their roles. Peterson perfectly embodied Martin’s smirking bravado-mixed-with-insecurity, lending his character a believability and depth not necessarily inherent in the play’s script. Director Kat Yen’s choice to have the supporting cast play their characters at the extremes of the spectrum was effective in enhancing the artistic aesthetic of the show, but it came at the cost of some of its emotional relatability.
That artistic aesthetic—fantastical, sumptuous, ethereal—may have hindered the actors to some extent, but it was wonderfully manifested in Alison B. Reed ’17 and Kat Yen’s stunning set. Benito and Gabriela’s house, which took up center stage, had walls and doors outlined by simple lines of brilliant golden lights. Inside, the house was split into two levels by the addition of a platform with a few steps; nothing was actually blocked off or separated, and yet the house had an incredible physicality that was further accentuated by the perfectly timed sound effects of doors opening and closing. Far behind the house, a jagged mountain range scratched at the bottom of a gorgeously expansive sky that lightened, darkened, and changed color as needed. The set was not there just to provide the appropriate props and backgrounds for the play’s actors; it was its own work of art.
“References” combined excellent acting, peerless set design, and experienced directing, and yet it struggled at many points because of the script itself. This production was not of the original play but an adaptation—created by the original author but unpublished and until now never-produced—but it nevertheless felt in want of further changes. The start of the show was draggingly slow and should have been cut down, and the characters’ lines were overworked, more concerned with flair and linguistic fireworks than genuine clarity and connection. At some points, the superlative efforts of the cast and crew won out, but at others, the show floundered due to nothing more than the script’s own unwieldy nature.
“References to Salvador Dali Make Me Hot” was clunky and cumbersome, and yet it possessed a beating and very human—or perhaps feline or canine—heart provided by its actors’ performances, above all those of Sass and Rivas. Despite the play’s weaknesses (it even broke the Chekhov’s gun principle in a very literal way), the dual pairs of Sass and Rivas and Trosser and Speedy managed to convey a moving meditation on times when love becomes pain—when two individuals are driven apart by a wedge as vast and impermeable as a war, a difference in species, or even death. Skillfully executed and beautifully designed, “References” showcased some of Harvard’s best theatrical talent; if it was not a great production, the fault lies neither with the cast nor with the crew.

The English department is now aiming to limit section sizes for writing intensive courses to 12 to 15 students—smaller than the target cap of 18 or so students in most lecture courses.
The smaller target is intended to improve the experience of students in courses that require them to write and revise their assigned papers substantially, according to Gwen Urdang-Brown, the department’s graduate program administrator, and professors. The Office of Undergraduate Education has informally aimed for smaller section sizes for writing-heavy courses for about a year now, according to Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris.
Harris did not respond to requests for comment on whether the College is targeting writing intensive courses outside the English department for lower section sizes as well.
In the past, students, professors, and teaching fellows have bemoaned large section sizes in courses across the College, arguing that large sections are not conducive to fruitful discussion and can be unwieldy. Over the past two years, a campaign to decrease College section sizes has gained momentum, garnering support from individual departments across the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and thousands of signatures on a petition that campaign members delivered to administrators in Massachusetts Hall last spring. 
Guidelines for what defines a writing-intensive course are largely modeled on requirements set in 2008 by the College’s Standing Committee on Writing and Speaking. The guidelines maintain writing intensive courses’ teaching staff should give “timely” feedback on student writing; students should write multiple papers and assignments; students should write and revise drafts of their assignments; and their writing should determine a “significant portion of the student’s final grade.”
English professor Stephen Burt, who is teaching two writing-intensive courses considered this semester, said his section sizes are “very reasonable.”
“Smaller sections make everything better,” said Burt, whose two classes enroll 48 and 70 students, respectively, but also have enough sections to accommodate smaller section sizes.
Some of this semester’s writing-intensive English courses include Elisa New’s “Fictions of America” and James T. Engell ’73’s “English Romantic Poets,” according to Urdang-Brown. Many of the English department’s “common ground” courses, concentration requirements for undergraduates, are also considered writing-intensive and require smaller sections.
Each spring, faculty from the English department must tell administrators how many sections they estimate their courses will require and note if their courses will be writing-intensive so that they can plan accordingly, Urdang-Brown said. Still, she said planning so far in advance can sometimes be difficult, especially if professors have not yet finalized syllabi and cannot anticipate how many students will actually enroll in their courses.
Graduate student teaching fellows and department administrators have cited several problems that they argue large sections create. Specifically, they say that larger sections inhibit student participation, increase teaching fellows’ financial insecurity, and train graduate students less effectively. Graduate students often say that large section sizes contribute to the stress and instability of their roles as undergraduate educators.

Harvard has now raised $6.1 billion in its University-wide capital campaign, and though the drive began with a $6.5 billion goal and a projected end year of 2018, Vice President for Alumni Affairs and Development Tamara E. Rogers ’74 reaffirmed Monday that Harvard will not raise that target.
“We would rather keep people’s eyes focused now on the purposes, rather than one single number,” Rogers said.
At this pace, Harvard will soon surpass the $6.5 billion mark, which would be a higher education record. Each individual school has now raised more than 50 percent of its goal, according to Rogers, and many initiatives have already reached or surpassed their targets. 
Still, fundraisers are pushing areas that still have a ways to go. Those areas include developing the new science buildings in Allston, financial aid across schools, and supporting humanities studies. She also said the campaign is all the more important given national and federal cutbacks to funding sources.
“We’re in an era of scientific discovery that’s almost unparalleled, and it’s costly,” Rogers said. “That's something that we really want to stress and have prospective supporters understand why it’s also costly.”
As the alumni office often does, Rogers also highlighted the value of small gifts to the campaign, saying that Harvard has raised between $45 and $50 million per year from gifts of $10,000 or less.
Reflecting on the $6.5 billion public goal of the campaign, Rogers said she thought the target was ambitious enough when the campaign launched. As they were deciding on the target, administrators looked at their last campaign, during which Harvard had not raised gifts as large as those raised by its peer institutions, according to Rogers. Based on their second-tier performance on raising large donations in the last campaign, Rogers did not want to assume they would get top-tier gifts this time.
“We didn’t know if that was going to change in that campaign, and then it did,” Rogers said.
So far, the University has landed a $400 million gift from billionaire John A. Paulson to Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, $350 million from Gerald L. Chan to the School of Public Health, and $150 million from Kenneth C. Griffin ’89, much of it to the undergraduate Admissions and Financial Aid Office. All three of these top donors received namesakes for their gifts.
Rogers and her team at Alumni Affairs and Development work closely with donors to “meet the donor’s philanthropic interest,” while still trying to advance Harvard toward the fulfillment of its campaign goals. Though fundraisers will not discourage people from donating to SEAS—which has exceeded its goal by nearly $150 million—Rogers emphasized that the office is looking to prioritize areas that have yet to make their targets in the second half of the campaign. When an alumnus, for example, has degrees from multiple schools, Rogers and her team mediate between various schools jockeying to court that donor.
“I would say that occasionally there are multiple interests, and we have to undertake a thoughtful collegial process in order to work them out,” Rogers said.
Occasionally, though, the goals of the donor do not line up with the needs or priorities of the campaign. Rogers acknowledges that sometimes Harvard cannot fulfill the philanthropic goals of each individual donor, but fundraisers make attempts to steer donors toward campaign initiatives.
“One could try in such a case to redirect and say you know you’re interested in this, but have you ever thought of that?” Rogers said.

Mary T. Bassett ’74, commissioner of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, argued that public health professionals have an important role to play in addressing systemic racial inequality in a talk held at the School of Public Health on Monday.
The discussion, which was introduced and moderated by School of Public Health Acting Dean David J. Hunter, was entitled “#BlackLivesMatter — A Challenge to the Medical and Public Health Communities” and focused on topics Bassett discussed in an article of the same name published in the New England Journal of Medicine this March.
Black Lives Matter, an activist movement against racial inequality in the United States that gained traction in 2014 following the non-indictments of white police officers who killed unarmed black men, provided the backdrop for Bassett’s speech on health disparities in the U.S.
Her article “aimed to encourage a critical dialogue and action around racism and health,” Bassett said, and was meant “to call on health professionals to engage the larger social movement that was spreading across the United States.”
Bassett said police violence against African Americans is a part of a much larger, systemic issue of racial inequality, of which disparities in health coverage are also a critical component.
“We all must be brave and use the term ‘racism’ in recognizing that the intent of the Black Lives Matter movement is to speak out about injustice more broadly, not only related to police violence,” Bassett said, noting that racial disparities in health coverage are disproportionately responsible for “taking black lives prematurely.”
Bassett identified a special responsibility for public health professionals to take on the issue of racial inequality in a direct manner.
“If we fail to explicitly talk about racism in health, especially at this time of public dialogue about race relations in this country, we may unintentionally bolster the status quo and enable the perpetuation of health inequities,” Bassett said.
Open to the public but attended primarily by affiliates of Harvard’s Longwood campus, Bassett’s talk lasted longer than an hour and featured a question-and-answer portion. After the discussion, several audience members said they found the talk accessible and relevant.
“My work is based on racial and ethnic health disparities and so these larger structural issues that we’re seeing take more of a prominent role on the national stage have always had an impact on the work that we’re doing,” said Catherine Duarte, a student at the School of Public Health.
“We need to name racism as a problem in promoting public health and thinking about anybody’s health,” said Sanjay T. Kishore, a student at Harvard Medical School. “We can’t shy away from calling it out.”

Angélique Kidjo, a Grammy Award-winning singer-songwriter and activist from Benin, is considered one of the most iconic and influential figures in African music. From Nov. 17-18, Kidjo will come to Harvard to perform, lecture, and hold a master class as part of the Learning From Performers program through the Office for the Arts. Prior to her visit, she spoke with The Crimson about her music, her background, and what she most anticipates from Harvard.
The Harvard Crimson: Which of the various cultures you have been exposed to influences you the most in your music, and why do you draw from it?
Angélique Kidjo: The traditional music from my country. And why I draw from it: because every music comes from home. When I was growing up, I was the youngest girl in the family. My brothers were 10, eight, seven years older than me. So there was a generation gap, but that generation gap came to my benefit, because I discovered the music that they were listening to.
THC: How does your activism as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador influence your view of the world and your approach to your art?
AK: At the end of the day, art is the largest resource for the people to turn to; otherwise, they lose their mind. I don’t see this world without music. If there’s no music, then I’ll go crazy. But that being said, there’s a lot of hope there, because people don’t give up…. Every single person is able to transform someone’s life, and their own life…. We have to be active. Music is the one thing that helps people really see their own potential and really spread their wings to become the change they want to see, the world they want to live in.
THC: Do you consider yourself a musician or social activist first?
AK: First of all, I consider myself as a human being, then as a woman, and then as an African, then as an artist and advocate at the same time. Both go hand in hand, pretty much. Because coming from an oral society, where your history is not written... you become a storyteller. Because that’s how you learn to know who you are, and that’s how you learn to become the witness of the lives of your people, of the world.... Singing has always been about giving voice to the ones that have no voice... Music is a powerful tool of peace. That’s one thing that I understand the most.
THC: You speak four different languages, and in some of your songs you seem to make up your own sort of language. How do you choose what language to sing in?
AK: I don’t choose any language. It comes to me, and I wish like any other singer/songwriter or any writer to understand the process of inspiration. It’s something that you don’t have control over. It comes or it doesn’t come. Sometimes you have things up inside of you and you don’t know where to start. And then sometimes you start writing and you don’t know where it comes from…. I’m inspired, the thing comes, the song comes, whatever comes—which language comes of it, that’s what I follow. I don’t even question it. Sometimes I…ask myself, “Well, why this language and not the other?” And I just walk away, because if I try another language it might not work…. When the inspiration comes with sounds that doesn’t exist in any language, I just put [them] there, and…it brings a subject to the table. And I touch that subject in the way that the sound comes to me.
THC: During your visit to Harvard, what do you hope to take from your interactions with the students?

The Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics, and Public Policy hosted a screening of the film “Dateline-Saigon,” an account of the freedom of access journalists had during the Vietnam War and the conflicts that resulted, on Monday night in Wiener Auditorium.
The film profiles five journalists who became known for their coverage of the Vietnam War and all went on to win Pulitzer Prizes—Peter Arnett, Malcolm Browne, and Horst Faas of the Associated Press; the New York Times’s David Halberstam ’55; and United Press International’s Neil Sheehan ’58—and follows their journey as they attempted to reconcile their previous convictions about the war with the reality on the front lines, creating controversy in the political world.
Both Halberstam and Sheehan attended Harvard and wrote for undergraduate publications; Halberstam was managing editor of The Crimson and Sheehan worked on the staff of the Advocate.
Director Thomas D. Herman led a question-and-answer session following the screening, alongside Walter Shorenstein Media and Democracy Fellow and former CBS news anchor Bob Schieffer and Shorenstein Center acting director Thomas E. Patterson, who served in Vietnam two years after the timeline of the film concluded.
“The picture that Tom portrays about journalists’ freedom of access in Vietnam was still the case then,” Patterson said.
The film received praise from audience members, many of whom complimented the director after the screening.
“This is the best film about journalism in Vietnam that I’ve ever seen,” Schieffer said during the discussion. “This is what real journalism is about and you saw it in this film tonight.”
The documentary took 12 years to make, Herman said, and he and his team initially considered over 45 journalists who covered the conflict before settling upon the reporters portrayed in the film.
“This is the hardest thing I’ve ever done, but it has given me the utmost satisfaction,” Herman said in an interview after the session. “I made a lot of mistakes...One of the lessons I learned was to have faith in myself and my vision for this film.”
On advice for aspiring young filmmakers, Herman said, “have confidence in yourself...make sure you have a good story to tell and then stick to it.”
He said he hopes that the public will watch the film and learn about the courageous reporting of these five people, as well as understand the importance of journalism in speaking the truth.
“There are lessons to be drawn...the same things are happening today—it’s just as important as it was in the story that mostly took place 50 years ago,” Herman said.

A group of undergraduates has re-started the South Asian Women’s Collective, a social and cultural organization for South Asian women, after almost two years of inactivity.
Kruti B. Vora ’17 and Kavya Pathak ’17 have led the effort to rebuild SAWC.
“People have been talking about it, and there has been a need ever since it died,” Vora said. “There are a lot of people looking for this inclusive community. So at the beginning of this year, we decided to put this into action.”
Pathak, a Crimson design editor, said that the South Asian community at Harvard has been enthusiastic about their efforts, and many upperclassmen remember their own positive experiences in SAWC from years past.
“It was a really amazing experience for me,” Swetha Sanagavarapu ’17 said of her experiences in SAWC during the first semester of her freshman year. “I got to meet upperclassmen, hear their perspectives on life at Harvard, and most of all, make new friends.”
Sanagavarapu is helping Vora and Pathak rebuild the organization.
According to Vora and Pathak, the Office of Student Life said that the group would not be formally recognized or funded until next semester, but Vora and Pathak said they will still provide SAWC opportunities this semester as well.
“The need is now, not next semester,” Vora said.
SAWC held its first event of the semester last weekend, which offered an opportunity for students to interact and meet new people.
“It went really well,” Pathak said. “When a group has died, sometimes you wonder: is there really a need for it? But to see a lot of upperclassmen who haven’t had this for a couple of years say ‘I’m so pumped, so excited for the next event’? That’s all the support you need.”
South Asian Men's Collective President Kais Khimji ’17 expressed excitement about the prospect of the re-emergence of a female counterpart to SAMC.
He said that the two groups were already trying to organize a mixer and that SAMC would offer to fund the mixer, “to show that SAMC fully supports the creation and sustenance of SAWC.”
Pathak and Vora said that members of SAWC are grateful for SAMC’s support and cooperation with rebuilding the organization.

Last Thursday, Oct. 22, the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum hosted the Malaysian singer Yuna in its “sonic cube,” an architecturally experimental venue that perfectly matches the boundary-defying nature of Yuna’s music. Despite impressive mainstream success—she’s a household name in her home country as well as the voice behind U.S. hits like the Pharrell-produced “Live Your Life” and the popular “Lullabies”—Yuna remains unknown to most. Those who do listen to her music are an eclectic mix: Young couples, African fashion designers, and even a tenured Harvard professor all crowded into Calderwood Hall for Yuna’s performance.
Yuna, in an impressively wrapped headscarf and a funky yet tasteful outfit, personified art devoid of gratuitous attention-seeking. She was at an art museum, and art she would deliver. While many artists rely on the “sex sells” mentality to draw attention to their music, Yuna does no such thing. By eschewing the overtly sexual references with which pop music is rife, she is free to explore the personal aspects of relationships more deeply, creating for herself a multi-dimensional identity free from the archetype of performer as spectacle.
With her rich voice and honest lyrics, Yuna lent meaning to songs like “I Want You Back” that might have proven trite in the hands of another artist. While many of her songs deal with heavier issues such as heartbreak and the dark side of fame (“Someone Who Can” and “Lights and Camera,” respectively), Yuna balanced out her set with songs that were lighthearted, even jubilant. “Rescue,” a song celebrating female empowerment, was downright catchy, and “Escape” was so upbeat that an elderly audience member began dancing, cane in hand.
According to Yuna, many of her songs are written based on personal experience. While the template of confessional songwriting could have easily degenerated into a barrage of hackneyed sentiments, Yuna’s evocative lyrics and unique vocal styling kept the songs fresh and honest. Instead of following the predictable formula of emotional climaxes, Yuna laid out a natural narrative that never felt overdramatized. She also knew how to order her songs for maximum effect: Instead of interspersing the lighter songs with more serious ones, Yuna chose to place similar songs next to each other, thereby allowing the emotional intensity of one song to build upon that of another.
Another integral part of her effect was Yuna’s unique singing style. Her artful vocal fadeouts and agile maneuvering of the high points in her songs were passionate without being overdone, and she embraced the natural imperfections of her voice for a deeply intimate and emotional experience. Her cover of Drake’s “Hotline Bling” was stunningly vulnerable; she stripped the music down to its essence and, through whispery highs and anguished lows, relayed a beautiful rendition that simultaneously channeled and innovated the spirit of the original song.
But it was the guitar that provided the unexpected yet essential accompaniment for Yuna’s Drake cover. Braden Lyle’s sound possessed just the right amount of twangy echo, and every so often, a piercing melody would weave beautifully with Yuna’s soft voice. While instruments often play a secondary role to the singer’s vocals, Yuna’s cover of “Hotline Bling” sounded more like a duet between her and the guitarist. This unconventional rendition illustrated how instruments play a crucial role in Yuna’s music, imbuing it with its rich and unusual sound. By mixing traditional Malaysian instruments—usually drums—with electric guitars, keyboards, and even the ukulele that she played herself, Yuna brought interest and dynamism to these oft-neglected backgrounds of pop music. In attending to the entire aspect of her songs, Yuna created a deeply expressive musical panorama that was emblematic of her work as an artist.
Altogether, Yuna’s performance fully conveyed the artistic and personal insightfulness that allows her to write music that is both meaningful and beautiful. In an era where the artist is often just as much a spectacle as she is the art she makes, Yuna has managed to put her music first, creating a genuine artistic experience that explores the archetypal themes of self-empowerment and young love in a way that is as innovative as it is intimate.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Graduate School of Education has raised $177 million toward its capital campaign as of Sept. 30, making fiscal year 2015 its most successful fundraising year ever with a record $50 million in donations.
The amount represents significant progress from the $145 million total reported this April.
According to Daphne Layton, the Ed School's senior associate dean for development and alumni relations, the all-time fundraising record comprises of more than 11,200 unique gifts and pledges. The Ed School has achieved nearly 71 percent of its targeted goal of $250 million, a figure Layton said she considered notable since the Ed School’s individual campaign only publicly launched a year ago. 
“We feel a tremendous sense of momentum,” Layton said. “We’re very excited with the progress we’ve made so far.”
The Ed School campaign has sparked the inception and development of several up-and-coming initiatives, namely the Harvard Teacher Fellows that underwent more than 10 years of planning and design before recruiting applicants this fall. According to Layton, the program has continued to receive strong support from donors—in addition to two anonymous gifts from last November and financial support from University President Drew G. Faust—and now amounts to $15 million in designated funds.
The Urban Scholars Program, another “seed program” gathering momentum from fundraising, will receive an ongoing pledge from donor David B. Ottaway ’62 to match any new gift to the program up to $500,000, Layton wrote in an emailed statement. The program offers fully-funded tuition to Ed School master’s students who demonstrate a “strong commitment to the betterment of urban education.”
While the scholarship is highly sought by Ed School master’s degree applicants, routinely receiving 300 to 400 applications, the program can only award 12 to 14 scholarships a year at the moment, Layton wrote.
“We would very much like to expand this program, which has helped us attract and enroll some exceptional students from across our master’s programs, who have gone on to lead or establish schools, work as teacher leaders, or take roles in district offices or nonprofit organizations serving urban populations,” Layton wrote.
Other “seed” initiatives gathering specific support include an online professional development program, which combines the efforts of both Ed School and Business School affiliates to train educators outside of Harvard, as well as the Education Redesign Lab led by Ed School professor Paul Reville, Layton said.
“Unrestricted” donations are contributed to the Ed School’s highest internal priorities: a targeted $75 million for financial aid, followed by a targeted $25 million towards funding faculty chairs, according to Layton.
“Those are both critical areas for us,” Layton said, “The way we view the campaign is that ultimately... even if we overshoot our global target, this campaign really won’t be successful unless we have made some pretty great strides in raising more money for those two buckets, because the future of the school depends on them.”
Aligning with Faust’s sentiment in September that the University does not plan to raise its overall capital campaign goal of $6.5 billion, despite $6.1 billion already raised, the Ed School will likewise shift focus to specific areas with fewer funds raised, rather than increase the target, Layton said.
Likewise, at the forefront of the University’s campaign, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences has raised $2.2 billion towards its $2.5 billion goal but is also refocusing on priorities that have garnered less support from donors. Meanwhile, Harvard Law School publicly launched its capital campaign last weekend with $241 million already raised toward its $305 million goal. Harvard Medical School has raised $467 million toward its $750 million goal one year into its own public phase of the campaign.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The “Paranormal Activity” franchise has been alive for six long years, with an annual premiere of a new film since 2007. “Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension,” the sixth installment of the series, promises also to be the final. A neat ending is not in this series’ future, however, as Gregory Plotkin’s debut film contradicts the series’ original, refreshing, and haunting indie movie experience, which was based on quality storytelling, a clever found footage format, and the use of the unseen. “Paranormal Activity: Ghost Dimension” instead attempts to honor its predecessors and liven up the series’ waning popularity by going bigger, not better, through the excessive use of CGI special effects, extensively shallow characters, and a formulaic plot.
This film picks up where “Paranormal Activity 3” left off, reaching past the last two installments, with Kristi (Chloe Csengery) and Katie (Jessica Tyler Brown) going upstairs to talk with “Tobi” (Mark Steger), the demon familiar from prior “PA” installments, about his grand plan. The film then jumps 25 years forward to December 2013 to find the Fleeges family, complete with father Ryan (Chris J. Murray), mother Emily (Brit Shaw), and daughter Leila (Ivy George), moving into a new house and preparing for Christmas. Soon joined by two guests, Ryan’s brother Mike (Dan Gill) and Emily’s best friend Skylar (Olivia Taylor Dudley), they discover boxes of tapes dated 1988-1992 and a camera in the garage. Armed only with these dated pieces of technology, the family faces the increasingly extreme supernatural happenings in their new home.
The script, written by Jason Pagan, Andrew Stark, Adam Robitel, and Gavin Heffernan, is poor and careless for the most part. Shallow characters are prevalent: a classic paranoid discoverer of the paranormal, a spiritual cynic, and an archetypal deadbeat brother. Leila is the only character with any sort of sophistication, and even that only goes so far, as seen in her unexplained transition from hesitant daughter interacting with a demon to uncompromising demon’s advocate seemingly overnight. This film also heavily relies on the exact same build-up as that of its PA predecessors: family in a new house, scary happenings that slowly escalate, and the “Tobi” name drop. Completing this thoughtless formula is a lack of realistic considerations. None of the adults seem to work, and Leila never goes to school. The ending, unsurprisingly, was an incredibly uninspiring attempt to tie the previous films together. Playing most heavily on “Paranormal Activity 3” (probably because of its notable success relative to other films in the franchise), the final scenes in this film are slapdash at best, throwing deaths at characters like free t-shirts and failing to truly add to the meaning of the other films. The closing shot could easily be mistaken for a B-movie knockoff of “REC.”
With this level of writing, the quality of the acting is certainly admirable. The characters are convincing, even with the little potential they are afforded to experience more than one emotion at a time. There are not any ear-piercing screams or conspiratorially terrified looks, and even badly written lines like the obligatory “I must be going crazy” are said with bracing delivery. Particularly lively exchanges that occur between the two brothers, who provide the only in-depth relationship in the film. Murray and Gill spar across the screen even as they meditate over the “horrifying” older tapes in some moments of genuine humor.
The cinematography is paradoxically well-executed but poorly thought out. Diverging from the series’ previous ideas of the value of the unseen, this film focuses on the portrayal of “Tobi” as a floating black material the characters holding the camera walk through. This results in an excessive amount screen time devoted to the demon, and, while the 3D filming helps, it certainly does not justify the technique. While creepy at first, by the end of the film the 3D becomes a distraction from the terrifying story. “Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension” uses the first person perspective as a tool to make the audience experience events alongside the characters. However, the use of 3D does not contribute to this end, and the found footage technique is tired and leaned upon too heavily by a director desperately trying to inject novelty into what is a fundamentally worn-out story. The film relies on silent, static shots of hallways and empty rooms, making it an exercise in audience anticipation. The framing is not scary but aggressive, with an excess of jump scares and loud noises.
“Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension” is another in a long line of cliché horror films. It brings some interesting concepts to the table but subsequently drags them down with a reliance on thin tropes and a lack of interesting wrap-ups. There are forced attempts to connect this new family’s experience with that of characters the previous films, but it is a feeble, unrewarding connection. This film shows that all the thrills originally keeping this series fresh are gone and only answers some of the questions that have been doggedly asked since the beginning. This series ends not with a bang, but with a whimper.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While the Harvard sailing team muddled through less than ideal sailing conditions throughout New England in a weekend of middling results, the team’s freshman sailors finished strongly in their Central Series 6 event.
CENTRAL SERIES 6
In a fleet style regatta of FJ’s hosted by Boston College, the Crimson boats were able to take advantage of the weather conditions en-route to a 4th place in a field of 12. The hosts dominated the event, but Harvard’s boats finished a mere six points behind second-place Coast Guard.
The Crimson’s B Division boat of rookies, consisting of skipper Nick Karnovsky and crew Alejandra Resendiz, carried the team through the event with its 31 points, placing just behind group winner Boston College with its 27-point result. The A Division boat finished outside the top half while sailing to 62 points.
MRS. HURST BOWL
The sparse breeze on the Charles River Basin didn’t cooperate for this Crimson contingent on Saturday, leading to the cancellation of all races on the day. However, the winds picked up overnight and fluctuated between five and nine knots throughout the day Sunday, allowing Harvard to fit in all of the races in its third home regatta of the year.
“We didn’t race at all on Saturday due to the lack of wind, so the regatta came down totally to the races on Sunday,” sophomore skipper Taylor Ladd said. “This makes it a bit harder because there are fewer races and you have to be more consistent.”
The Crimson squad finished 11th overall in a field of 17 teams, sailing in FJs. The gold went to Coast Guard.
In the A Division, recent ICSA Match Race National Championship qualifier, Ladd, and sophomore crew Emma Wheeler, finished at 11th with a point total of 92.
B Division sailors, freshman skipper Taylor Gavula and senior crew Sydney Karnovsky, produced consistent results on the weekend en-route to a 6th place result with 82 points over 10 races.
SHERMAN HOYT TROPHY
Light winds also prevailed at the Edgewood Yacht Club in Providence, R.I., at the bi-divisional event of Z420’s hosted by Brown University. After only two A Division races allowed on Saturday, Sunday morning’s conditions were more promising with winds of 6-10 knots and gusts of 15 knots.
The breeze again died down for the afternoon’s last few races, but Harvard’s B Division boat of sophomore skipper Nick Sertl and junior crew Nomin-Erdene Jagdagdorj was able to capitalize on the circumstances. After a slow start to the morning, the duo put up higher place finishes, resulting in its sixth-place finish in the division.
“[The] slow condition definitely rewarded patience, which was a lesson we learned the hard way in the first couple races,” Sertl said. “It basically came down to trying to put yourself in the most wind and wait until others made mistakes.”
The A Division crew of senior skipper Marek Zaleski and junior crew Julia Lord placed 13th in its group, as it only cracked the top 10 in its first race of the weekend.
After placing 14th in the event a year ago, the Crimson capped the day with a 10th-place finish out of an 18-team pool. The squad put up 101 points, placing behind four fellow Ivy League crews and champion MIT.
OBERG TROPHY
In a completely in-conference, tri-divisional regatta of FJ's and NC Firefly's hosted by both MIT and Northeastern, Harvard cracked the top half, finishing 9th out of 18 with 196 points across the three divisions. With very few contests heading out on Saturday, the hosts squeezed in most of the 21 races on Sunday as MIT pulled out a victory with a total of 104 points.
The A Division boat skippered by Nick DiGiovanni and crewed by Priscilla Russo finished the best of all the Crimson boats, but poor finishes in the middle three races marred strong results in the morning and late afternoon in its divisional 57-point 8th place finish.
The Harvard B and C divisional crews posted more consistent results throughout the weekend, finishing 9th and 12th, respectively.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Being sidelined for two games with an upper-body injury is certainly a way to upset a player’s rhythm.
Having to become reacclimated to one of the top offenses in the FCS complicates a player’s return from injury even more.
Despite his two-week absence, senior wide receiver Andrew Fischer displayed no signs of rust in Harvard’s 42-7 victory over Princeton on Saturday.
Fischer caught 10 passes from senior quarterback Scott Hosch and gained a total of 190 yards. He added a touchdown in the third quarter which helped the Crimson increase its lead over the Tigers.
Facing an opponent which had defeated Harvard in two of their previous three meetings, the Crimson sought to maintain its momentum from its perfect 5-0 start and emerge with a win.
However, midway through the second quarter, Harvard still struggled to snap a 7-7 tie with the visiting Tigers.
Neither team managed to score in the first quarter, and with 6:11 remaining in the second, Princeton scored on a two-yard pass to tie the game.
“We were moving the ball the whole first half, but we just kept shooting ourselves in the foot,” Hosch said. “We got down close to the red zone, and that drive, we just kept telling the offensive line, ‘We’ve got to finish, we’ve got to finish the drive.’”
A lack of offensive production in the first half was a rarity for Harvard, as the unit has been nothing short of dominant this fall.
The team has not once scored fewer than 40 points in a game, and Harvard torched Brown for 53 points in its first Ivy League matchup of the 2015 season.
As the Crimson began to mount an offensive attack midway through the second quarter, Fischer played an integral role in helping Harvard pull away from the Tigers for good.
By the end of the first half, Fischer had racked up 110 yards on six receptions.
The Diamond Bar, Calif., native added a touchdown as well, one of six for the Crimson in the game.
During Harvard’s second drive of the third quarter, Fischer started the drive off with a 29-yard punt return to put the Crimson in good field position.
At the end of Harvard’s march down the field, the senior caught a 14-yard pass from Hosch to put the Crimson up, 28-7.
Harvard went on to add two more touchdowns to seal the victory, the team’s sixth of the year.
Fischer also played a crucial role as the Crimson pulled away from Princeton in the fourth quarter.
The senior hauled in a 27-yard throw from Hosch on a crucial 3rd down, and later picked up a 31-yard grab to put Harvard into the red zone.
With the Crimson offense operating on all cylinders once again after a shaky first quarter, Fischer was able to exploit the holes in Princeton’s defense.
The wide receiver was one of Hosch’s primary weapons against the Tigers on Saturday, and he was a crucial component of many of Harvard’s drives.
Fischer was quick to credit the rest of the team for yet another explosive offensive performance.
“When the defense has to respect [senior running back] Paul Stanton Jr. and [senior wide receiver] Seitu Smith out of the backfield, it really opens up the pass game,” Fischer said. “And Scott Hosch delivering pretty incredible balls—it really makes my job easy.”
“I think the biggest thing is just overall the offensive effort,” the senior added. “It starts with the play-calling, the great effort by the offensive line.”
Versatility is key for the Crimson, and Fischer’s return for the Princeton game allowed the team to have even more flexibility on offense.
“[Smith] was a slash player in high school, he was a great running back, he was a great receiver,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said.
“Fisch was a very similar type player. We’re always trying to find those guys because of versatility—it’s like having a tight end or an H-back who play multiple positions,” Murphy added.
Fischer’s return to action also bolstered Harvard’s kickoff and punt returning game.
The senior brought back two kicks for 16 yards and four punts for 48 yards against Princeton.
In the three games before his injury, Fischer had amassed 126 total yards on 12 receptions.
He more than doubled that number in Saturday’s game with 190 yards. So far this season, Fischer has recorded a career-high 14.4 yards per reception.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 2, 2015, at 1:59 a.m.
The Harvard men’s water polo team (14-8, 6-3 CWPA Northern) traveled across the country to California this weekend, where it swept the Santa Clara Bronco Invite tournament for the second consecutive year.
The team won three games against ranked West Coast opponents and finished the tournament with a 5-0 record overall.
But the Crimson’s strong final result didn’t arise until a crucial performance from junior co-captain Joey Colton.
Sitting on a four-game winning streak, the Crimson entered a second overtime period against the University of California, Davis with the score tied at nine apiece.
Colton quickly put Harvard ahead with his second go-ahead goal of the day, firing a shot into the back of the net just minutes into the period. But then, Colton did his part on the defensive end as well, coming up with the game-saving block in the final seconds to clinch the victory.
“We were stoked to play in California,” said junior defender Dan Stevens on the tournament. “That said, we were playing a lot of teams ranked higher than we were. We were perceived as underdogs by many of the teams there.”
HARVARD 10, UC DAVIS 9 (OT)
The Aggies (14-7, 3-0 WWPA) jumped out to a 5-3 lead at halftime despite a first-half hat trick from co-captain Ben Zepfel.
The game marked the first time during the tournament that the Crimson faced a deficit heading into the second half, but the defense held strong.
Highly touted freshman goalkeeper Anthony Ridgley had several key second-half stops.
But Harvard could not have come back without work on the offensive end as well.
Colton and senior attacker Noah Harrison combined for second-half goals to send the match to overtime.
Harrison’s strike in the final minute was especially important, serving as the equalizer.
Colton ultimately scored the game winner.
Harvard coach Ted Minnis noted that it was a defining moment to see the team pull out a win after playing five games in three days.
“We were pretty gassed at this point,” Minnis said. “The guys found a way to push through in overtime.”
Aggie freshman attacker Ido Goldschmidt recorded five goals in the loss. Meanwhile, Colton and Harrison, in addition to Zepfel, all ended the game with hat-tricks for Harvard.
The game marked the third upset of the tournament that Crimson was able to pull.
“We felt a bit shortchanged with our ranking,” Stevens said. “I think the way we played this weekend will give us this respect we deserve.”
HARVARD 9, AIR FORCE 8
Colton found a rhythm early, opening the game with a pair of goals to put Harvard ahead 2-0.
Air Force (6-13, 0-3) tied the game by halftime, but a third-quarter goal from Colton put the Crimson ahead for good.
Colton went on to score a game-high four goals, while senior Harvard goalkeeper Colin Woolway recorded eight saves to preserve the victory.
HARVARD 13, FRESNO PACIFIC 9
Harrison scored a game-high five goals and the Crimson used a seven-goal second-half effort to pull away from the Sunbirds (9-12, 1-2 Pacific West) in the Saturday nightcap.
Harvard took an early 4-1 lead, but Fresno Pacific came back to be within one goal, 6-5, at halftime. The Crimson proceeded to pull away with four tallies in the third quarter and three in the fourth.
HARVARD 7, SANTA CLARA 2
It was all about defense against the Broncos.
Behind Woolway, who led the defense with five saves, the Crimson shut out the host Broncos (9-15, 1-1 Golden Coast) in the second half.
Harrison, Colton, and senior Robbie Fluegge notched opening period scores to give the Crimson the early lead, and Harvard entered the second half protecting a 6-2 advantage.
The two goals-against also marks the lowest total the Crimson has allowed this season, and the first time Harvard has held its opponents to that mark since the 2010 season.
Santa Clara’s defeat came a day after it upset Brown, a team the Crimson has gone 0-3 against this season.
HARVARD 10, SAN JOSE STATE 8
With the opening game of the tournament tied at six going into the final quarter, freshman attacker Nick Bunn, sophomore utility Colin Chiapello, Stevens, and Colton each netted a goal apiece to send Harvard past San Jose State (3-19, 0-6 Mountain West).
The defense allowed just two goals in the fourth quarter to clinch the win for the Crimson.
Ridgley recorded 11 saves overall for the night.
This year’s Spartans squad is the first men’s water polo team to be fielded by San Jose State since 1981.
The reborn team has yet to find success, winning only three games thus far, but still managed to stay close through three quarters on Friday night before fading down the stretch.
This story has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: November 2, 2015
A previous version of this story misspelled freshman goaltender Anthony Ridgley's name.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After spending two weeks on the sideline nursing an upper-body injury, senior wide receiver Andrew Fischer returned to action this past weekend with 10 receptions for 190 yards and a touchdown as the football team routed Princeton, 42-7, to stay undefeated. His strong performance, highlighted by an over-the-shoulder touchdown grab in the third quarter, earned him Athlete of the Week honors.
While the senior stood out on the football field, it was also a fine weekend for a couple of the Class of 2019’s female athletes during Freshman Parents’ Weekend:
Kathleen Young, Women’s Field Hockey
Freshman forward Kathleen Young’s performance in the Crimson’s 2-1 loss to Princeton was one of the brightest spots in the hard-fought defeat. She created the game’s first clear-cut scoring opportunity early in the first half, using her combination of shiftiness and strength to turn away from two Princeton defenders and round goalkeeper Anya Ersoff. She was unable to control the ball before the Tigers backs closed in, but it was a sign of things to come.
Just minutes later, Young finally got the goal her play deserved, sticking home the rebound from senior forward Elizabeth Jacobson’s penalty corner to give Harvard the 1-0 lead.
The Essex, Vt., native almost sent the Jordan Field crowd into a frenzy late in the second half with the score still knotted at one apiece. She picked up the ball deep in Harvard territory and used her speed to slalom through Princeton’s helpless defense. One-on-one with the goalie, Young’s stick got caught in the turf, spurning the opportunity, but it was a moment of individual brilliance from the young forward.
Young, who is third on the team with four goals and 10 points this season, will look to continue her form Wednesday against Boston University.
Caitlin Weigel, Women’s Rugby
On the rugby pitch, freshman Caitlin Weigel led the charge in the Crimson’s record-breaking win over Penn, scoring four tries as Harvard ran away with the game, 132-5.
Hailing from Hudson, Ohio, Weigel has emerged as an integral part of this Crimson squad which improved to 4-2 overall and 3-2 in Ancient Eight play. Her first score was part of an early spurt in which the Crimson jumped out to a commanding early lead, notching three tries in the game’s opening minutes.
Weigel was similarly influential in the team’s 111-5 win over Yale, converting three tries of her own and playing an integral part in a number of her team’s scores. She also tallied one of the team’s more memorable tries against Princeton, opening up the scoring with a 30-yard run through the Tigers defense.

Weigel’s unique blend of power and agility have made her one of the team’s most effective players, and the Crimson will certainly be relying on her talents during the Ivy League tournament and in the years to come.

Although fame and humility might seem antithetical at first glance, the two can be ideal partners. This is exemplified by the way famous people interact with the general public. This activity often, by its very nature, requires a certain level of tact and humbleness. While working as a manager at the ArcLight Cinemas in Hollywood some time ago, I was occasionally privy to interactions between A-list artists (actors, filmmakers, musicians, writers, etc.) and their admirers during events such as premieres, special screenings, and post-screening question-and-answer sessions. On one such occasion, I witnessed Justin Timberlake straddle the line between fame and humility impeccably, proving that, rather than being dichotomous, success and modesty can indeed be symbiotic.
It was the winter of 2013, and Timberlake’s movie “Inside Llewyn Davis”—directed by the Coen Brothers—was playing at the ArcLight Hollywood. Timberlake and his co-stars, Oscar Isaac and Carey Mulligan, were on hand for a question-and-answer event at the end of a sold-out screening. Although all three actors were munificent in their engagement with the guests, Timberlake in particular had a magnetic, boyish ebullience. He talked passionately about his collaboration with the Coens—praising their clarity of vision and ingenuity—cracked self-deprecating jokes about his insecurity as an actor, and burst into song intermittently to thunderous applause. He was generous, uninhibited, and eloquent.
Normally after special events management and security escorted high-profile guests to their luxurious vehicles—usually black limousines and Escalades—waiting at secluded exits. The goal was always to get the stars out safely so that they would not be overwhelmed by overeager fans. Most of the celebrities who visited the ArcLight Hollywood for special events appreciated this exit strategy, which the experienced ArcLight crew always executed methodically. Some stars, however—such as Gerard Butler, Keanu Reeves, Ethan Hawke, Hugh Jackman, Kevin Spacey, Joss Whedon, Viola Davis, Chadwick Boseman, Pharrell Williams, and Timberlake, to name a few—preferred to interact with fans after their event rather than hurry out of the theater.
Timberlake took his time as he left the ArcLight that night. He snapped pictures with his fans, chatted with them animatedly, answered questions about a myriad of subjects, signed autographs, and snapped countless selfies. What’s more, when the procession—including his co-stars, studio representatives, theater security, and theater management—finally arrived in the parking lot, Timberlake shook hands with everyone, walked to his nondescript SUV (which he had parked amongst a miscellany of guests’ vehicles), slid behind the wheel, and waved with a big smile as he drove off.
It was impossible not to respect Timberlake for his humility, and it was refreshing to see a world-famous artist so comfortable in his own skin and so overtly appreciative of those who appreciated his work. It is quite possible that Timberlake might simply have been playing a role perfected over years in the spotlight. If this was the case, he pulled it off effortlessly. The impact of his visit was palpable on the ArcLight premises that night. Excited fans congregated in the lobby and brandished photos they had taken with Timberlake. Some repeated jokes the artist had cracked with them. All had clearly gotten more than their money’s worth. From a management perspective, it was a flawless night—especially for the guests.
Timberlake seemed to have mastered the words of famous Dutch painter Piet Mondrian: “The position of the artist is humble. He is essentially a channel.” Timberlake exuded presence, courtesy, and respect, all hallmarks of humility. His comportment brings to mind the words of acclaimed writer David J. Bobb in his book “Humility: An Unlikely Biography of America’s Greatest Virtue”: “The true power of humility is missed by many successful people today.” In a culture where, according to Bobb, “cocksure, supercilious, and narcissistic displays of arrogance abound in every arena of life, while acts of humility go unnoticed and unheralded,” Timberlake’s example shows that fame and humility are not binary. On the contrary, being down-to-earth not only enhances accomplishment, it underlies self-respect, magnanimity, altruism, and happiness. As Confucius put it simply: “Humility is the solid foundation of all the virtues.”

This summer, I made my foray into the curious world of coffee shops. Although I am from Portland, Ore.—the unofficial mecca of independent coffeehouses—I remained skeptical: “Nothing can be as good as my mother’s Turkish coffee,” I thought, with the same stubbornness that led me to eschew store-bought hummus. But one Saturday morning, in the name of exploration, I grabbed my best friend and headed to the most hipster coffee shop I could find. The front of the building was unremarkable, but upon walking in I was immediately surrounded with the aromas of coffee beans and expensive perfume. The walls were a metallic brocade, and the floors were made of warm chocolate wood.
Behind the counter stood an incredibly attractive barista, who grew much less attractive once I asked him what espresso was.
“It’s very strong coffee,” he said cryptically, the midday sunshine illuminating his artfully tattooed biceps.
“Ok,” I said, glancing at my friend. “I think I’ll take the espresso.”
Five minutes later we claimed a table outside and, feeling very much the parisiens, we sat down to enjoy our coffee.
It was terrible.
We grimaced simultaneously and then immediately realized that we were the only ones who seemed to notice anything wrong. The bespectacled couple near us was animatedly chatting away—looking at them, I could believe that Portland was the city where young people come to retire.
The point of this little anecdote is that I had missed the point. The Coffee was secondary to the social space of the coffee shop. The idea behind “let’s grab a cup of coffee” is not the “cup of coffee,” it’s the “let’s.” Coffee is inseparable from its social connotations; for the hipster, the intellectual history and exclusivity of coffee can be leveraged to reaffirm the boundaries of the hipster social space.
Coffee’s history began in Ethiopia when, according to an Arab legend, a goatherd discovered that his flock gained extraordinary energy after chewing on the beans of a certain plant. The shepherd decided to boil the beans, and the result was a coffee. From its humble origins, this drink spread to the rest of the Arab world, where it became an integral part of social and intellectual life. The stimulant nature of coffee made it perfect for sustaining long, intellectual conversations, and the coffeehouses that sprung up were nearly always in cosmopolitan centers of learning such as Aleppo, Syria, and Istanbul, Turkey. The link between coffee and intellectuality was further strengthened when, sometime in the late 1500s, coffee made its way to Europe.
At this time, many learned Europeans were turning to the Middle East for cultural and intellectual inspiration. In order to gain prestige, prominent families often displayed their connection to the Middle East in the form of rare goods such as coffee. By consuming coffee, affluent Europeans displayed their access to a good (and therefore a culture) that was generally inaccessible to most. Thus, the beverage became enmeshed with exclusivity, and this tradition continues to this day.
While the hipster may not use coffee to symbolize exclusivity in the same way that Europeans did, the ritual of drinking coffee is an important part of the hipster persona. By attending to the source of the coffee and whether or not it is Fair Trade, the hipster establishes herself as a conscious buyer and thereby thwarts the mindlessness of the mainstream consumer. The coffee order itself is also an integral part of establishing the hipster identity: Few hipsters simply order “coffee.” An article from Food Republic, “10 Coffee Orders to Step Up Your Game,” is a perfect example of how the cultural symbol of coffee has a competitive undertone. The drinks by the name of “cortado,” “Gibraltar,” and “breve” are meant to reaffirm the hipster status of exclusivity: The language of coffee thus functions as an insider jargon that clearly delineates the in-group and the out-group.
The coffee shop is also a symbol of an intellectual boundary: Instead of rushing away, the hipster often lingers. This act of leisure signifies that the hipster has time for intellectual pursuits and is therefore someone who is “different” or more enlightened than the imagined masses. The intoxicant nature of coffee might also have something to do with it—consuming coffee, just like smoking or drinking, serves as an initiation of sorts. While some hipsters may not actually like coffee, they drink it anyway, simply because they do not wish to be excluded from that certain society that does drink coffee.
If this sounds like something that all people, not just hipsters, do, that’s because it is. Coffee serves better than anything to show that, while the external markings of hipster culture may be different, there is nothing radical in the social structure or community rituals of the group. While some hipsters would rather die than let a pumpkin spice latte touch their lips, they have already imbibed the most mainstream drink of all: the need to belong.

Veena Das, a professor of anthropology at Johns Hopkins University, addressed harmful relationships, rape in India, and the violence embedded in societal structures during a talk entitled “Fleeting Moments That Last Forever: Violence Of and Against the Everyday” in Sever Hall Monday night.
Das also serves on the executive board of the Institute of Socio-Economic Research on Development and Democracy in India. She is an ethnographer of India and has published numerous books. 
Das was chosen as a speaker for this lecture, an Andrew W. Mellon Foundation Seminar on Violence and Non-Violence, by professor Homi K. Bhabha, director of the Mahindra Humanities Center. Before the event, Bhabha said that he has known Das “for years, and she does work, which is very much in keeping with the theme of the Mellon Seminar at the Mahindra Humanities Center so...she was an obvious person.”
Das started by questioning what people perceive as “the ordinary,” asking about what forms the ordinary might take.
She then continued to frame her lecture around a paper she wrote about everyday violence, and presented a series of questions to help conceptualize this kind of culturally embedded violence. The first was, “How is ordinary life made poisonous?” Referencing texts by herself and others, she discussed the culture surrounding rape in India.
“Rape remains a public secret,” she said.
Another question dealt with the challenge of dealing with the “poisonous knowledge” possessed by individuals and groups of people, specifically in the context of strained family relations.
Das went on to address the challenge of standing up to destruction. She offered a metaphor of an “army walking through a garden of flowers,” destroying them. The army does not look back at the carnage it caused, she said, but in most cases, the everyday is remade with what is left behind in the rubble.
In the last part of her lecture, she pointed out the significance of names and words, especially in Indian Sanskrit.
“[Words] remain as threads throughout the durable structures of life,” said Das.
After the lecture, Das and Bhabha held a question-and-answer session. Professor of medical anthropology Arthur M. Kleinman delivered the closing address, describing Das as “one of the most important social theorists of our time.”

Not many ballet performances begin with a few dozen men in sweatshirts and sweatpants on stage. But John Neumeier’s “Third Symphony of Gustav Mahler: A Ballet”—Boston Ballet’s season opener, which premiered on Oct. 22—is not shy about parting from convention. The show, which will run until Nov. 1, is brought back to life this fall by choreographer Neumeier, who originally premiered the work as director of The Hamburg Ballet in 1975. More than 60 dancers perform in this ambitious piece, in which Neumeier divides Mahler’s complex, dramatic cacophony into six movements named “Yesterday,” “Summer,” “Autumn,” “Night,” “Angel,” and “What Love tells me.” While Neumeier’s interpretation of the “Third Symphony” loosely follows the storyline of one man, played by principal dancer Lasha Khozashvili, the choreographer ultimately discourages the audience from seeing the show as a slavish adherence to any one narrative. In this way, he creates a production that consistently pushes the boundaries of classical ballet.
As the first movement progresses, the sweats come off. The male dancers’ muscular bodies are soon stretched into both classical and unconventional ballet positions. Their battements, for example, are executed with such intensity as to highlight the athleticism of their movements. The men’s vigorous, synchronized motions evoke an almost marching band, or army-like, quality. No women appear on stage for the entire first movement. Gender dynamics, in fact, prove to be an important theme throughout the performance. The omission of women from the first movement makes the second all the more poignant: As ballerinas in pastel dresses slowly begin to pepper the stage, their femininity is emphasized. Meanwhile, a male dancer sits on stage, watching and creating a sensation of voyeurism, so that the audience perceives the female through the eyes of the male, as an observer. The romance and intimacy of the beautiful duet phrases later in the performance are heightened by this consciousness. These singular moments of stark gender imbalance that imagine the dancer as an observer speak to Neumeier’s ability to surprise the audience. He maintains his eccentric style throughout the show. “Night,” for example, begins with 10 minutes of music-free dancing, and over the course of the performance dancers form human pyramids four times.
The show’s simplicity counters the complexity of its movement and music. Costumes are minimal, coloring the dancers in brushstrokes of color while allowing their bodies to remain the focus. The stage is free from set, save for a lit backdrop of changing colors. This minimalism juxtaposes strongly with the intricacy of the music. In the pit, 78 musicians, 20 chorus members, and one vocal soloist, Sarah Pelletier, attempt to do justice to the dance’s muse, while the Boston Opera House’s soaring ceilings carry the dramatic, emotional notes of Mahler’s longest work.
In fact, this intense emotion, which Neumeier tries to capture in his dancers, ties the whole show together. The dancers’ faces alone are often enough to discern the sensations that their movements suggest. Khozashvili in particular seems to incarnate the desire, struggle, and yearning of his character. Neumeier’s choreography throws to the wind the often-restrained feeling of traditional ballets.
The Boston Ballet’s run of “Third Symphony of Gustav Mahler” fuses elements of ballet tradition in a modern framework with a subtlety that is not easily achieved. Neuemier is unique in encouraging the audience to acutely perceive gender relationships, and the emotional nature that this lends to the show does not soften the intricacy of the movement. The difficult choreography is not always easy to digest, but, in drawing on Mahler’s music, Neuemier does not intend to present the performance as such.

On the bouncy “C’est La Vie (Say the Casualties!),” Neon Indian lead singer Alan Palomo presents listeners with an emphatic, electric-tinged imperative: “The world is moving / Everybody tune in / To the wave and supersonic sound.” Throughout its past three albums, chillwave powerhouse Neon Indian has proved that it’s unafraid to embrace the sounds of the future. But while the band’s reliance on a wide swath of sonic flourishes­­—popping bubbles, clapping hands, shooting lasers—consistently instills a modern edge to its work, its dramatic lyrics often hinder its albums from being truly exceptional electronic records. Luckily, the band’s latest effort avoids this trap; “VEGA INTL. Night School” stands as a glossy new addition to Neon Indian’s catalogue that draws on elements of the past, including the tongue-in-cheek nature of 1980s hits, to push its singular sound forward.

In the four years since releasing 2011’s “Era Extraña,” Palomo has spent time developing several side projects, including VEGA, which eschews Neon Indian’s shimmering electro-pop for a more beat-heavy aesthetic. While admirable, the stylistic risk proved to be a misfire—VEGA’s sonically middling “Well Known Pleasures,” an extended playlist of disco-influenced, synth-pop tracks, received less-than-stellar acclaim from fans and critics alike. But instead of abandoning VEGA—and its budding material—altogether, Palomo decided to merge its unique sound with that of Neon Indian to produce a joint album of sorts. Thus, “VEGA INTL. Night School,” the electronic band’s third studio album, possesses an eclectic array of influences, from 1970s dance to psychedelic surf rock to pure noise effects, rendering the listening experience more engaging than past Neon Indian offerings.
Lyrically, “Era Extraña” focused on lovelorn longing, the album itself a wistful, wide-eyed gaze on the mistakes of the past and their implications for the future. “Night School,” however, is all about the present: Its 14 tracks celebrate the electric spark of attraction, not its ashy residue. Gone are Neon Indian’s standard contemplative tracks, imbued with a dreamy romanticism. In their stead, the songs on “Night School” pulse along with a light and contagious energy, unburdened by any emotional heft. On the rollicking “Techno Clique,” Palomo waxes poetic on the joys of a casual hook-ups, cooing how “There won’t be heartbreak in the room tonight / No politic to serve / Only ticking, endless ticking / Just you and I.” Though “Night School” could occasionally benefit from some lyrical substance, there’s a newfound, addictive excitement to the music that undeniably elevates the album’s quality.
In shifting toward more lighthearted lyrics, Palomo allows the most notable aspect of “Night School” to shine: its unwavering sense of madcap irreverence. Palomo has a wild imagination, but on past efforts his experimental, goofy instrumentation has often clashed with the cloying sentiment of his songs. On his latest release, though, the singer-composer has wholeheartedly embraced the inherent eccentricity of the chillwave genre. Lead single “Annie” chronicles Palomo’s attempts to locate his missing friend, including calling her multiple times a day: “Now I try to sleep / but all I hear is the beep / Just your answering, answering machine,” he whines. And yet, the tropical bounce and the nasal, Phil Collins-style delivery of the chorus render the undeniably ominous lyrics markedly less threatening. The gravity of the situation, coupled with Palomo’s nonchalance, injects the album with a refreshing sense of humor direly needed on Era Extraña and 2009’s “Psychic Chasms.”
Within the opening minutes of “Night School,” Palomo describes himself as having a “Street level line of sight / With a head full of pesticide.” Coincidentally, “Night School” plays in a similar fashion. A marriage of slick, ordered production and the utter irreverence of 1980s pop, the whole album feels like a swirling, druggy haze, vacillating between saccharine sweet, vertiginous highs and bass-heavy, cacophonous lows. Yes, the album could use the occasional touch of seriousness, but its witty lyrics, layered, mercurial harmonic structure, and infectious peculiarity work in tandem to create Neon Indian’s best work to date.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“We like to say it’s been 400 years in the making,” Jill Johnson, director of dance, tells me of the College’s new Theater, Dance , and Media concentration, which was approved this past April. Sitting in Johnson’s office in the Harvard Dance Center, lit only by natural light, I’ve heard this comment before. Martin Puchner, the concentration’s chair, and Deborah Foster, its director of undergraduate studies, both invoked the project’s unofficial history as well.
According to the concentration’s brand-new, slickly designed website, “The idea of combining the study of theater with theater making goes back to the early twentieth century at Harvard, when an English professor by the name of George Pierce Baker offered a course in playwriting and added a workshop devoted to performance.” Since around this time, the performing arts have flourished on campus, primarily through extracurriculars in the form of the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club, the Harvard-Radcliffe Modern Dance Company, and the Harvard Ballet Company, to name a few of the key players.
Members of the concentration committee say the move is well timed for the performing arts, which are in an excitingly interdisciplinary phase. Unlike most conservatory models, the program places theory and practice on equal footing. And distinct even from similar liberal arts majors, it is meant to be highly interdisciplinary—not just a Dramatic Arts major but an intersection of theater, dance, and “media.” While resources and student interest remain skewed toward theater, the concentration’s confirmation is ideally meant to incite the dance component’s expansion. Among faculty and students alike there is a hope that the concentration will kindle collaboration within, among, and outside of the united departments.
One point the committee members have stressed in the development of the new concentration has been its focus on both theory and practice. Students are required to take at least four theory courses in addition to four practice-based or studio courses. There are students who gravitate more toward practice and others who are drawn more toward theory, as well as those who lie somewhere in between. But of the students who have reached out to the concentration committee so far, none seem upset over this scholarly requirement or wish the curriculum were a more traditional conservatory BFA program.
“I think practitioners—and maybe I can speak for myself as a choreographer—I don’t separate theory, history, and practice. Those are all woven and in a timeless way,” Johnson says. “I think it’s a real opportunity to reframe what practice means. In dance in particular, for example, we have to repeat a lot—not a sort of mindless loop, but rather we need repetition to move more deeply—quite literally move—into deeper understanding. And I think the complexity of that learning can be translated in many different ways, from crowdsourcing to social change.”
In addition to combining theory and practice, members of the committee feel that it is important to emphasize the interdisciplinary nature of the concentration. “When our undergraduates leave this place they will, of course, have had some vertical experience in one of those forms perhaps, but they will also have found ways to integrate the study of those three elements,” Foster says.
Eliza B. Mantz ’18, who plans on declaring TDM, speaks very positively of this aspect of the concentration. “I think that if we start to get stuck in our own little theater bubble, then our theater will become one dimensional,” she says. “When we have those relationships with people who maybe don’t even know anything about theater—or approach theater from a movement perspective or a film perspective—we can create theater that’s more interesting.”
Faculty and students in TDM have suggested that, while some concentrators may go on to careers in the performing arts, all will also learn skills that can be applied to other fields. “We’re very much intent upon developing a cohort of undergraduates who will leave this place not only able to go on into the theater world…but also able to go on to other things, for which the skills they’re learning here will be extremely valuable,” Foster says. “Those are the ability to work collaboratively, to think creatively and on the spot, [and] to use their imagination with others in concert towards an idea that they wish to express.”
The TDM concentration combines a number of pre-existing departments, and most of the students declaring TDM have taken one or more of the classes offered in these fields either as electives or to earn credit toward another potential concentration. Yet solidifying the new program will likely change the academic experience of these students in myriad ways.
Firstly, students will receive concentration credit for work they have already been doing. “I was essentially already making up what TDM was,” says Aislinn E. Brophy ’17, one of two junior concentrators. Before the concentration officially existed, Brophy had declared English but was pursuing a special concentration very similar to what TDM is now. “Having TDM as an actual option has really made it much easier for me in many ways,” she explains with a smile. “I’ve fulfilled a lot of the requirements I have to fulfill for it anyway, so now it’s just a way for me to explore more and have more fun things to do and more course offerings and more explicitly-stated support from people who I know are there as a support network.”
Unlike in most concentrations, students will receive credit for certain extracurricular accomplishments as well. Students in TDM are required to participate in at least four productions during their time at Harvard. Two of these must be concentration productions, but the other two can be student-organized. One draw of the concentration for some students, then, is not only the ability to focus on the performing arts academically, but also the time to do so outside of class, as the concentration’s academic requirement is only 11 courses.
The A.R.T. is also significantly involved in the new concentration. Ryan McKittrick, head of dramaturgy for the concentration and director of artistic programs and dramaturg of the A.R.T., speaks to this relationship: “The A.R.T. is more deeply integrated into the life of the University than ever,” he says. “And because of that, we are able to immerse students in the professional life of the theater and give them access to our season—design courses around each particular season.” He gives “Introduction to Dramaturgy,” a course he is co-teaching with Diane Paulus, the artistic director of the A.R.T. at Harvard, as an example: “It so happens that…every main show in our season is an adaptation—either a film or a book of poetry or a memoir or novels—so we decided to co-teach this course this year and to focus it specifically on adaptation.”
McKittrick, moreover, says he believes that more structure and advising support will strengthen the pre-existing resources: “There’s a formal structure in place with a sequence of courses and specific opportunities, so that we can really mentor students now in a much deeper way…I think it’s different when you have a framework in place and when you have the support of a department behind you,” he says.
According to members of the concentration committee, high school students in the midst of the college search have already reached out to inquire about the TDM program. They have heard from students who say they would not have considered Harvard if not for the concentration’s confirmation. Mantz says she herself was leaning towards a BFA program until she heard there might be a performing arts concentration at Harvard in the works. A number of the current and future concentrators cite this potential for incoming talent as a reason for excitement.
As for current concentrators, Brophy and Matthew H. Munroe ’17 are the sole juniors in TDM. “We weren’t going to [accept junior concentrators] officially, but they really wanted to do it, and we felt like we should accommodate that,” Puchner says.
This semester, Brophy and Munroe have been enrolled in the junior tutorial, and both speak highly of the experience so far. “We created our own syllabus, so it’s basically like we’re doing whatever we want, and it’s incredible,” Munroe says. “We just meet for two hours each week and have amazing discussions about theater.” The two centered their first unit around understanding “what it’s like to have a life in the theater,” he relays. They researched theater companies in cities around the U.S. and interviewed people they knew in the area. Now, he says, they’ve moved on to a more traditional unit, reading Russian actor and director Constantin Stanislavski’s work and its reception. However, their assignments remain practice-based; for example, they will complete acting exercises for their current unit.
One reality of the concentration right now is that there are far fewer dance courses than theater courses available. Perhaps it is therefore unsurprising that there seem to be few—if any—sophomores who plan to declare TDM next month with a focus in dance. Sophomore dancer Laurel R. McCaull ’18, who is considering a secondary in TDM, speculates that the lack of job security, in combination with the absence of a full dance curriculum, might contribute to the relative shortage of dance-minded concentrators. She adds that many dancers on campus might have come to Harvard with a very different plan of what to study.
But Johnson assures that there will be more course offerings to come. Students are likely to see a greater number of guest faculty in the future, for instance, and she highlights the extensive list of master classes that have been offered in the past. Already, next semester, Foster will be teaching a new course on “Argentine Tango: Culture, Music, and the Dance.” And there is a course that may be offered next spring that will combine poetry and choreography, co-taught by Jorie Graham, widely anthologized poet and teacher of poetry workshops at Harvard. For now, Johnson suggests the independent study option as a supplement for those interested in dance wishing to concentrate in TDM.
McCaull also suggests that the concentration should offer more technical dance classes in addition to the exploratory courses Johnson refers to as “research labs.” “I think that might make it feel like the dance component is more well-rounded,” she says. According to Johnson, such classes are, in fact, likely on the way.
McCaull and fellow dancer Gabe S. Martinez ’18 raise one frustration that they say is shared by many of their peers: that the Harvard Dance Project, one of just a few available dance courses, only counts for half credit, even though it meets for six hours per week and necessitates work outside of class.
As Johnson puts it, one hope of the concentration is precisely this impetus to develop dance at Harvard. “The concentration has given…identity to students who want to pursue these practices as a concentration—so where they felt invisible before, they’re now visible,” she says. “It’s a call to action, because when you feel like you’re a part of a population that is invisible, there’s a certain script about that…so I think what it’s given is great agency.”
While the “Dance” element of “Theater, Dance, and Media” may seem, at worst, secondary to theater, the “Media” component is an outright mystery to many. This confusion even extends to some of the students considering the concentration themselves. “Media doesn’t mean anything to me,” says Sam A. Hagen ’18, who plans to declare TDM come November. “It means anything you want it to mean. So to me, the ‘Media’ means I can take VES classes and it’ll count.” Hagen is not entirely incorrect in this assumption. There are a number of VES courses cross-listed with TDM, and Puchner himself mentions this possibility when speaking to what media entails.
Puchner also acknowledges the potential ambiguity of the word “media”: “We fully understand that [media] is a broad term,” he says. But he goes on to clarify the reasoning behind its inclusion. “We wanted to be a forward-looking concentration…. And one of the most exciting things that is happening right now in the performing arts is the use of new media...everything from film on stage to livefeeds to social media…. So we wanted to tap into this exciting moment.”
As Foster puts it, “The media part of what we’re doing in Theater, Dance, and Media is...where media intersects with performing arts and has become such a big part of it…. How are theater artists engaging with [the virtual world], and how are they incorporating it...and making it work as a tool for their own creative imaginations and their productions?”
By way of example, Puchner highlights a course called “Live Art in the Theater Environment” that will be taught in the spring by Dean Moss, a choreographer and video artist who has previously taught classes in the VES department. According to its description in the course catalog, “the course will focus on practical strategies employed in the blending of movement, sound, image, and presence in contemporary performance works.” Of the opportunity, Puchner says, “I think it’s going to be really exciting and going to showcase a lot of things that the concentration is about.”
Intertwined with the concentration’s interdisciplinary nature is an additional emphasis on collaboration at many levels. For example, the new area of study presents potential for collaboration among concentrators. “Of the people that are concentrating in my year, we have writers, stage managers, directors, actors, dancers. We have people who are already really good and really passionate about a certain thing, and I think that we could combine to make something really beautiful and amazing,” Mantz says. “I think that it’s hard to individualize a collaborative art.”
Faculty and students alike profess a desire for exchange between dancers and actors as well. “While I have been saying that the dance part of TDM needs to be more of its own entity, I do think there needs to be more conversation between theater and dance, because they do feel very separate right now,” McCaull says. There is even a particular interest in partnerships with departments and concentrators outside of TDM. Foster mentions the VES and Music departments, and Puchner contributes English and perhaps Comparative Literature. Ilya D. Vidrin, a graduate student at the Harvard Graduate School of Education and a dancer himself, hopes collaboration could even extend into the sciences. “[My ideal vision for the concentration] would be to see the bounds of interdisciplinary collaboration pushed,” he says. “I would love to see…[students] really think deeper not just about dance, theater, and media as a concentration but as a sort of interdisciplinary pursuit within something that they might have been interested in before.”
