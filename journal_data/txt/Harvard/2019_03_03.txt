After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a night dedicated to the six outgoing seniors in their final game at Lavietes Pavilion, the Crimson represented the program in fitting fashion. Capping off a weekend sweep and propelling itself to first place in the Ancient Eight, Harvard defeated Princeton 66-58 in a second-straight defensive showcase.
With Columbia’s upset over Yale, the Crimson will likely enter the Ivy tournament as the first-place seed if it can match the Bulldogs’ record in next week’s final weekend of Ivy play. But this game was much more than the inner-workings of conference seeding, as attested by players and Coach Amaker.
“It’s kind of surreal, but I wouldn’t want to be there with any other dudes,” captain Corey Johnson said. “I love my teammates and the reason why I get up every day and lead these guys — and be captain — is I believe in every one of them and just want to keep winning games and hopefully get that championship.”
In the 5:19 of game action allocated to the seniors, Harvard’s starting five of Tommy McCarthy, Robbie Feinberg, Corey Johnson, Weisner Perez, and Balsa Dragovic held its ground defensively. Princeton was held scoreless in its first six offensive possessions, turning over the ball twice. Johnson provided the Crimson’s sole offense with two top-of-the-key jumpers until Perez muscled a layup at the tail end of those initial five minutes.
“For [the seniors] to have the opportunity to get us off to a really good start, they did that,” coach Amaker said. “I thought the team was energized, the building was energized. We talked about if they can get us off to a good start, it would give us a great chance to finish right. I thought our seniors did exactly that.”
Outside of the seniors and their families, the other notable guest-of-honor was Kyrie Irving, point guard of the Boston Celtics and alum of The Patrick School, from which Harvard guard Bryce Aiken is also a graduate. Aiken rallied from a quiet six-point first half to tally a team-high 22 points on the night in front of his long-time friend and mentor.
“I approach every game the same, regardless of who was here,” said Aiken when asked about Kyrie’s appearance, “I come out here playing for my team with the name across my chest...with a winner’s mentality and just attack it.”
Harvard led 6-3 as the seniors took the bench, but the early margin would not hold despite the re-entry of the usual starters. The Tigers jumped out to a quick 9-2 run, while the Crimson offense stagnated outside of a Lewis hook shot.
Aiken struggled out of the gate, but re-discovered his touch right when the Crimson needed him the most early on. Following his first made jumper of the contest at the 8:22 point, Aiken followed with two consecutive layups with the second following a pick-off of freshman Jaelin Llewellyn. That play brought the game back to square-even at 17.
The first half was again largely a defensive showcase, much like last night’s contest against Penn in which the Crimson put up just 22 points, compared to the Quakers’ 26. Harvard shot 29.7 percent from the field in the first frame, with just an early Haskett triple and Catchings lay-up complementing Aiken’s six points and Lewis’ lone bucket in the first ten minutes of action following the exit of the seniors.
The Crimson concluded the half with two strong finishes at the basket from first-year Noah Kirkwood and Lewis, holding a Tigers team that went stone-cold in the final 4:40 of the frame. Princeton went 8-of-23 from the field on the half, with just sophomore guard Ryan Schweiger’s five points highlighting the rest of the Tigers box score.
“We had 37 shots in the first half, so we had so many more because of the offensive rebounding,” Amaker said. “But we weren’t able to convert. That’s what we were talking about at halftime...we missed a lot around the rim, didn’t get to the foul line at all. So we really talked about it at the half, that we really needed to take advantage of the opportunities that we were going to get in the second half.”
Aiken’s notched a quiet six points in the first frame, but quickly put a dent on the scoring sheet coming out of the second-half locker room. Starting off the first Crimson offensive possession with an up-and-under finish, the Randolph, NJ., native knocked down his third jumper of the contest followed by a deep triple in Harvard’s 9-2 run to start the stanza.
The Crimson’s eight-point margin it carved in that span would hold form heading into the halfway point of the frame. Harvard seemed allergic to the charity stripe, not taking a free throw the entire contest until the 13-minute mark of the second frame. Offensively, Aiken knocked down his second triple of the contest after going between-the-legs and launching a line-drive shot over Myles Stephens at the 11:59 point, complementing two more signature hook shots by Lewis.
Kale Catchings continued to play a meaningful impact on the defensive end, swiping away two balls as the Crimson had open opportunities on the drive. The Tigers scored five straight field goals heading into the eight-minute point, but the Crimson held strong with another Aiken step-back triple and a Djuricic open-lane dunk to preserve a three-possession margin.
The Tigers kept its fight alive as Mitch Henderson put the ball in junior big Richmond Aririguzoh's hands on the interior. Aririguzoh knocked down four free throws while Stephens converted on an and-one opportunity to narrow the margin to four.
But it was the freshman, Kale Catchings, who provided the needed end-of-game lift for the Crimson. The Missouri native found bottom of the net for two straight threes to bring the lead back to 59-51 with 3:30 to play. In another strong performance on both ends of the court, Catchings stepped up in the absence of junior Justin Bassey.
“We have had a lot of motivated guys to pick it up and I have kind of fed of that,” Catchings said. “We have really competitive practices every day so I never felt I would struggle to give my best effort. I know I can try my best to pick up what we missed in Justin [Bassey].”
The second Catchings triple was also a byproduct of hungry rebounding from Djuricic, who talled an impressive five offensive boards in the game. In what has become an integral component to his game, Djuricic has used his long wingspan to tip balls back to the perimeter, extending multiple possessions offensively.
“Big plays for us, big winning plays that we had to make,” Amaker said. “Bryce’s ability to when he drives to find people, to make the play and not just make the shot. Very impressed by his ability to do that tonight. Our team is so much better when he is showing confidence in his teammates in that particular way.”
A Kirkwood triple at exactly the final minute of play all but sealed this contest, capping off his 3-of-8, nine-point night for the freshman. The energetic crowd started a “We want seniors” chant in the final minutes, but Amaker did not oblige to these demands. Still, the coach acknowledged in laudatory fashion the contributions of this class at the postgame presser.
“We mentioned in the locker room how proud we are of what they have contributed to this program,” Amaker said. “To be able to close it out for their home tenure with a win this weekend over Princeton is very meaningful...Their contributions to this program over the four years have been immeasurable and I can’t thank them enough.”
In the players’ run at the presser, Aiken demonstrated his appreciation for the seniors in fitting fashion, symbolically insisting that senior Corey Johnson be asked the last question. But when it appeared as if it was Catchings — and not the captain — would end the presser, Aiken stepped in to meet this demand.
“Corey, if you could describe [the] Harvard experience with one word?” Aiken asked.
After a brief chuckle, Johnson delivered the final word in his final Lavietes home game.
“Exceptional.”

COLGATE 4, HARVARD 2
Coming off of a 5-2 win in Game 1 of the ECAC Quarterfinals, Harvard would be looking to sweep No. 9/9 Colgate with another upset. Tying the game 1-1 at the end of the second period, the Crimson looked poised to continue the momentum in the third. The Raiders, however, found an immediate response, pulling ahead 2-1 before the intermission and then icing the game in the final period.  By the time the buzzer sounded, Colgate would seal the 4-2 victory. With the series knotted at one, Sunday’s decisive Game 3 will determine who advances to the semifinal.
With 3:21 to play in the middle frame, Raider freshman forward Delani MacKay would find the back of the net for Colgate (22-9-5, 15-4-3 ECAC) with an assist coming from senior defender Olivia Zafuto. The puck trickled across the crease, and MacKay was able to out-skate Harvard defenders to the post to bury the puck. The goal had come in response to Crimson freshman forward Dominique Petrie’s second-period strike, which had given Harvard (12-14-5, 9-9-4 ECAC) new life. On the play, she was able to weave the puck through a maze of players in front and into the top corner after receiving assists from freshman defender Kyra Willoughby and senior defender Kaitlin Tse.
Entering the third, after Colgate had already put a major roadblock on the Crimson comeback with its second goal, the Raiders quickly expanded their lead. 4:35 into the final frame, freshman forward Eleri MacKay, Delani’s identical twin, struck for Colgate. Crossing the blue line, MacKay dumped the puck onto the net. Veering towards the goal, a short-hop bounce fooled Harvard freshman goalie Lindsay Reed, and all of the sudden the Raiders had a two-goal lead. Under a minute later, Zafuto would return to the Raider scoring attack — this time finishing the goal off herself. After cutting through the Crimson defense, she found enough separation to create a breakaway opportunity. Faking to the forehand, she pulled the puck to her backhand before sliding home the goal for a 4-1 lead.
Special teams proved to be a factor for both teams as Colgate’s first goal came on the power play and Harvard’s second, from Emma Buckles, also resulted from the five-on-four advantage. When the Crimson did score its second goal, however, only 1:45 remained on the game clock, so the effort appeared to be too little, too late.
Reed posted solid numbers in net, saving 36 of the 40 shots that came her way. That said, the Raider jump start to the third period period still did foil the Harvard netminder, who ranks in the top three nationally in save percentage.
The Crimson must win tomorrow if it wants to keep its season alive as the team will only make the NCAA Tournament as an automatic qualifier, which would come with an ECAC Tournament title. While Colgate theoretically may be able to make the tournament as an at-large, it would likely find itself on the outside looking in with a loss tomorrow since only eight teams qualify for the NCAA tournament. Thus, the matchup looks to be a true do-or-die, win-or-go-home contest. The puck drops at 3 pm.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s hockey team entered the final weekend of its regular season needing just one standings point to lock up a first-round bye in the ECAC Tournament. And with some help from its fellow conference foes, the No. 16/15 Crimson (record) also had a chance to claim this year’s Cleary Cup, given to the regular-season winner of the ECAC.
With starting goaltender Michael Lackey still sidelined with a knee injury, coach Ted Donato ’91 would once again turn to junior Cameron Gornet between the pipes as the group trekked to Upstate New York for bouts with Rensselaer and Union. Harvard’s 4-1 victory on Friday did clinch the bye-worthy top-four finish, but a 4-3 setback the following evening held the squad firmly at fourth place at the conclusion of the 22-game conference schedule.
“We knew we needed...one point to secure a bye, but we also knew how big the weekend was for the PairWise,” sophomore defenseman Reilly Walsh said. “We battled hard and came away with a win [at RPI], so that was huge. But unfortunately, we couldn’t really play a full 60 against a pretty hard-working and solid Union team…. We did reach one of our goals, which was getting a bye in the playoffs, so there’s positives to take from that.”
UNION 4, HARVARD 3
During Saturday’s clash against the Dutchmen, the Crimson had much to play for: the top four ECAC teams all had a chance to nab at least a share of the Cleary Cup.
It took just under three minutes for Harvard to take the first step towards this regular-season title. Walsh opened the scoring, firing a shot from the blue line on a behind-the-net feed from sophomore forward Jack Donato. Union senior net-minder Jake Kupsky was well-screened and unable to stop Walsh’s attempt.
“I think we came out well,” said co-captain Lewis Zerter-Gossage. “This is a tough place to play and we knew that going in."
But the early goal was not an indicator of the result. Just as the Crimson jumped out the gate in the first period, Union bounced back in the middle frame. Tallies from sophomore defenseman Brandon Estes and senior forward Sebastian Vidmar — whose goal was his 100th career point — allowed the Dutchmen to take back the momentum and the lead in front of an excited home crowd. While shot volume had been nearly even through the opening period, Union held Harvard to just 3 chances in the second while putting up 13 of its own. The Dutchmen also had two powerplay opportunities that stanza.
“We definitely didn’t do our business in the second period,” Zerter-Gossage said. “That’s when they took over the game. We had too many lapses in the defensive zone that ended up costing us, not only giving them the momentum but also leading to the chances that eventually led to their goals, too."
Though the contest featured only one man-advantage goal, it proved a significant one: Union struck gold on a 5-on-4 at the beginning of the final period, its third straight goal. The game was starting to appear out of reach for the Crimson until Zerter-Gossage notched a tally from the net-mouth, bringing the score to 3-2.
But at that turning point in the contest, the Dutchmen’s penalty killers made perhaps the most important stand of the night, successfully killing off a Harvard 5-on-3. Union added yet another goal soon after the kill, extending its lead to 4-2. A last-minute Crimson score came from rookie forward Wyllum Deveaux after the team pulled the goalie, but the hosts staved off any tying tallies.
“Whenever you have an opportunity like that, especially in crunch time when you’re down by a goal, it’s up to us to step up and take advantage of that opportunity,” said Zerter-Gossage about the 5-on-3 chance. “We were excited once we got the opportunity and we didn’t seize it. It’s definitely a blow to the team, but we gotta bear out next time we have that kind of chance.”
HARVARD 4, RPI 1
Friday’s matchup featured an unusual stoppage right before the second period began. With the Crimson trailing by a score after 20 minutes, a firm alarm went off, necessitating an evacuation from the Engineers’ Houston Field House. The team resorted to the bus while the situation in the arena was resolved.
Despite the odd circumstances, Harvard returned to the ice a new team for the remaining two frames, limiting the opposition to just eight shots in the second and third periods, combined.
“It was definitely really funny,” said Walsh of the fire alarm fiasco. “It actually kind of helped us...relax a little bit and kind of laugh some of it off, but then at the same time helped us dial it in. We had a really good second period. We took it to them. It definitely changed the course of the game — obviously, that may or may not have anything to do with the fire alarm.”
Freshman blue-liner Jack Rathbone’s goal 13 minutes into the middle stanza proved to be the game-winner. Zerter-Gossage retrieved a puck in the offensive zone, shuffling it to linemate Colton Kerfoot at the goal line. The junior forward found Rathbone’s tape through a seam, and the rookie rearguard buried a wrist shot near-side on RPI goaltender Owen Savory.
­­A common theme in the Crimson’s regular season, multiple freshmen carried the load offensively on Friday. In fact, four different first-years accounted for Harvard’s quartet of goals in the winning effort.
Forward Casey Dornbach notched the game midway through the second frame and also added an assist on fellow freshman Jack Drury’s third-period tally. In the waning minutes of the tilt, forward R.J. Murphy potted his second goal of the season — and the first true snipe of his career, given that his first collegiate goal came on an empty-net conversion in the Beanpot consolation game back in mid-February.
The class of 2022’s success this season manifests itself in the numbers. At the conclusion of the regular season, Harvard sits sixth in the NCAA in points scored by freshmen (86), while leading the nation in rookie assists per game (2.02) and ranking fourth in the country in points per game (2.97). The Crimson’s first-year group is particularly lethal on the powerplay, pacing college hockey in both assists and points while on the man advantage.
“We’re a fairly young team that has been seeing success from the freshmen,” Walsh said. “When it comes down to it, their class has been contributing at a really high level, and a lot of our offensive success is coming from them. I think it just goes to show you what our team has now, but what our will have in the future as well.”
Before the Crimson seized control of the contest, Gornet (1 GA, .950 SV%) did his part to keep his team in the game. The St. Louis, Mo., native made 11 of his 19 saves in the opening period, including a flashy glove save on Engineers forward Jacob Hayhurst, who had an in-alone chance after leaving the penalty box.
“[Gornet has] stepped into a big role for us,” Walsh lauded. “He’s done very well, making saves that he needs to, and even bigger saves. He’s definitely given us some confidence back there, too, and without him, we might not be in some games that we’ve been in. He’s done a really good job stepping into a role that’s very important when trying to make a playoff push.”
Harvard’s first victory at RPI since the 2014-2015 campaign provided the necessary standings points to assure a top-four finish. Hence, the Crimson will be off next weekend, as the team regroups from its 1-1 outing in Upstate New York and Lackey continues to rehabilitate from the injury that has sidelined him for four games now.
