After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With Harvard University President Drew Faust featuring as honorary coach, it was all Crimson on Friday night at Lavietes Pavilion as the Harvard women’s basketball team (11-11, 6-3 Ivy) completed a season sweep of visiting Columbia (12-12, 1-8) with a comfortable victory, 84-54. It was the team’s biggest margin of victory this season, with the previous high coming in an 18-point win over Boston University.
Led by freshman guard Sydney Skinner, who collected a career-high 14 points, 5 assists, and 3 steals in just her sixth start of the season, the Crimson ran off 14 straight points midway through the second quarter into the third quarter, extending a 29-26 lead to 43-26. The key word of the day was distribution, with five Crimson scorers taking part in the run and four scorers finishing the game in double-figures.
“Where I see Sydney in the bigger picture is that she’s a great scorer,” coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “She can take it to the basket, she can shoot the three, and she can shoot the pull up. What I didn’t want to happen to her was to bury at the point so that she’s distributing.”
Harvard started the game hot, grabbing an 8-2 lead within two minutes. The Lions, however, responded by bringing on freshman guard Emily Surloff, who deposited a trio of triples to hand Columbia a 16-15 lead just five minutes later. Surloff’s introduction saw the Lions look more threatening offensively, and the Los Angeles native finished with nine points, six assists, and four rebounds.
Last time the two teams played, Harvard was made to sweat in a 69-66 win. But just as it looked like Columbia had a foothold in this game, the Crimson responded with a couple triples of its own courtesy of Skinner and senior guard Shilpa Tummala. Harvard finished 10-for-21 (47.6%) on the night from downtown, its highest percentage of the year from outside of the arc.
“We’ve definitely grown into the team that we are now, we’ve learned about each other,” Skinner said. “I think now that we knew the style, putting our players against them, we were on a different level. I think we entered the game knowing that, and having confidence in ourselves and in our team, and knowing that we should beat them by 30, which we did.”
After the run late in the first half that saw Harvard start to pull away, the Lions looked to respond in the third quarter but could only muster two free throws in their first four possessions. The Crimson’s defense was aggressive, with the guards pressing high into the passing lanes and the forwards shifting side to side quickly, forcing 23 Columbia turnovers on the night.
That defensive solidity helped Harvard start the second half with another 14-4 run, with freshman guard Kelsey Bogdan’s triple and sophomore forward Kirby Porter’s layup stretching its lead to 57-30 with 3:40 remaining in the third quarter. It was Bogdan’s first career three-pointer, and it sent the entire Crimson bench, especially captain Kit Metoyer, into a frenzy.
“Kit is one of the biggest people on the team who has the most passion,” Skinner said. “She is really good at expressing it, even when we’re up or we’re down… If we’re down, she keeps it real, which is really good for us.”
The Crimson benefitted heavily from dominance on the boards, leading the Lions 47-36 on the glass. Freshman guard Madeline Raster led the team with eight rebounds, the third time she’s led the team this season. Porter and captain AnnMarie Healy also had six apiece. Harvard controlled the paint, scoring 24 points from inside compared to Columbia’s 14.
“The kids played great,” Delaney-Smith said. “I think that we’re learning to make better decisions, see one another, and play together, which you can’t always get out of a young team. The longer we play together, the more experience we game, and I think that’s what we saw tonight.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Freshman point guard Tommy McCarthy hit an off-balance baseline floater with 5.5 seconds to play to lift Harvard (11-15, 3-7 Ivy League) to an improbable 76-74 victory over Cornell (9-15, 2-8) on Saturday night in Ithaca, N.Y. The shot capped a 30-7 run over the last nine minutes of game action to propel the Crimson to the second-largest comeback victory of the Tommy Amaker-era.
“To be able to do that and do it on the road, that’s even more impressive,” Amaker said. “I can’t tell you how proud I am of Agunwa, Tommy McCarthy, his point guard play, his savviness, winning basket, all the plays that he made for our team. He really grew up tonight right in front of our eyes.”
It was a fitting conclusion to the evening for the Rancho Santa Fe, Calif. native, who at times looked like the only Harvard player who stood any chance of scoring on the Big Red defense. Cornell held a 67-46 lead with 9:02 left to play and it appeared as though the Crimson would be sent home from an Ivy League road trip winless for the third time this season.
Rather than subbing in reserves and calling it a night, Amaker went with a lineup of McCarthy, fellow freshman Corey Johnson, junior Zena Edosomwan, and seniors Patrick Steeves and Agunwa Okolie to give the hosts one last push.
“I thought we were very positive on the sideline, on the bench, his teammates, and certainly making a couple baskets for [McCarthy] to get his confidence flowing, then he had to go against some really good guards on their team,” Amaker said.  “So I think being a competitor you know with that position, you’re certainly trying to match those guys as well.”
A cold shooting stretch by the Big Red, a rebounding clinic by Edosomwan, and a renewed energy on the offensive end got Harvard within three after a Johnson trey followed the game’s final media timeout. After consecutive stops on the defensive end sandwiching a Steeves layup, Okolie gave the Crimson its first lead of the evening with 1:59 to play.
Edosomwan pushed the lead to three with an uncontested dunk but Cornell freshman Matt Morgan, who had been a non-factor after lighting up Harvard in the first half, stymied the run with a deep three, setting the stage for the McCarthy heroics. The Big Red got the ball back with a chance to tie or take the lead but its star freshman and Ivy League-leading scorer could not get off a shot.
It was a tale of two halves on Saturday. Cornell came out of the gate on fire, making eight of its first nine three-point attempts. Morgan set the tone for the Big Red in the first frame, scoring 19 points in the game’s first 11:44. Before intermission, Cornell made eight three-pointers, shot 62.5 percent from the field, and capitalized on eight Crimson turnovers. The hosts entered the locker room holding a 46-31 edge.
The Big Red held its largest lead, 21 points, with just over nine minutes to go in the second frame.
“We just wanted to take it one play at a time,” McCarthy said. “We knew there wasn’t one, there’s not a 21-point shot so we needed to take it one possession at a time, really focus on defense, getting stops because we didn’t do enough of that in the first half.”
McCarthy led Harvard with 14 first half points but it looked like his teammates missed the bus from Columbia. The start of the second half was not pretty for either team, with the Big Red missing seven of its first 10 shots but managing to keep Harvard at arm’s length due to the Crimson’s foul trouble.
While Harvard began getting and hitting better looks on the offensive end, Cornell could not shoot itself out of the funk and continually turned the ball over. In the second half, the Big Red shot 28 percent from the field and committed nine turnovers.
While Edosomwan only chipped in 13 points, his rebounding down the stretch was one of the differences for the Crimson. The junior had five offensive rebounds on a night in which the team corralled a total of 18, compared to just 10 for Cornell.
The game was also historic in other ways for Harvard. Johnson broke Laurent Rivard’s freshman single-season three-point record, with 63 makes on the year. Okolie added 16 points and seven rebounds in what was his final trip to New York as a Crimson player.
“[Okolie]’s been unbelievable, definitely our x-factor,” McCarthy said. “It’s so good to see happen to him because he’s worked his butt off, he’s one of the best teammates I’ve ever had and he does everything for us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Friday night, Harvard wrestling (8-4) stepped onto the mat to defend its home territory for the last time this season. The Crimson handled Hofstra (5-12) in commanding fashion, registering a 34-15 win over the Pride.
“We came in with a lot of momentum, a lot of positive energy, and we took it right to them,” co-captain Todd Preston said. “We knew that we had the chance to finish the season tying for most wins in Harvard wrestling history, and that was really special.”
Harvard nearly lost its footing three bouts into the meet, as Hofstra slowly closed in on the Crimson’s lead. The Pride’s near comeback was fueled by junior Frank Affronti and sophomore Cory Damiana, who notched points for Hofstra at 174 and 184, respectively.  Affronti gained a decision over sophomore Josef Johnson in a tightly contested matchup, 5-4, to end the second-year’s two-bout win streak from last weekend.
“It’s always tough losing a match,” Preston said. “But, for him, if anything, it should be a confidence booster. He is right there in it with the best competitors in the country, and can wrestle with anyone. When it comes to conference time, he has a great chance of coming back in conference competition and upsetting some of these guys that beat him, and getting to nationals.”
The initial lead for the Crimson was established by sophomore Tyler Tarsi and senior Devon Gobbo. Tarsi earned a 4-0 decision against his opponent, putting Harvard on the board at the very beginning of the meet. The No. 19-ranked Gobbo matched this intensity in the following bout at 165, as he brought his opponent down by technical fall, 18-3.
“Devon is a leader on this team,” Preston said. “This year, he’s finally gotten his health back and been able to wrestle at his best, and just show out against his opponents, and it’s really exciting to see.”
Another dominating Crimson performance for the day came at the very last moment of the meet. In his last career match at home, co-captain Patrick Hogan won by major decision, 13-4, to cement the score at 34-15.
“He definitely capped of the dual meet season in style,” Gobbo said. “He had some great takedowns, and has been wrestling really well for us.”
Three bouts before Hogan’s commanding win, the Crimson almost relinquished the reins to Hofstra a second time. Freshman Nolan Hellickson, competing at 125 lbs, was down 6-0 at the very beginning of his matchup. Following this rocky start, the rookie managed to turn the tables completely, pinning his opponent for the win, and extending Harvard’s lead to 18-15.
“Turning it around like that.. it’s not an easy thing to do..” Preston said. “He has really done a great job for us this year, and I couldn’t be more excited to see what’s in store for him for the rest of the season and his career.”
Following Hellickson’s bout, senior Jeff Ott kept the trend going by notching a pin of his own against Hofstra’s Marcus Begay at 133.
“Jeff has honestly just been getting better and better with each passing week,” Preston said. “He had a really strong turn last night, and I think that’s going to be very big for him, and is going to serve as a big confidence booster going forward in this last part of the season.”
The Pride forfeited at 141, handing Preston his last victory at the Malkin Athletic Center. Next up for the Crimson is Eastern Collegiate Wrestling Association Championships in two weekends at Princeton. Preston and the rest of the Harvard seniors will have the opportunity to build off of the emotional high following their final home victory.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For all intents and purposes, Senior Night will not be the final game the Crimson’s eldest class suits up for within the confines of the Bright-Landry Hockey Center—the No. 13/13 Harvard men’s hockey team is guaranteed at least one home series in the ECAC tournament. But regardless, on a night where the senior class was honored for its four years donning Crimson, the squad’s two most decorated seniors rose to the occasion.
With the game knotted at four goals apiece and less than three minutes left in regulation against 11th place Colgate, co-captain Jimmy Vesey corralled the puck off a blocked shot in the offensive zone. The senior drifted towards the net and found fellow co-captain Kyle Criscuolo alone outside the crease, standing by the far post. 
Criscuolo then shoveled it past Raider goaltender Bruce Racine to give Harvard a one-goal lead that it would not surrender. Senior forward Colin Blackwell and Vesey also added last-minute goals to seal a 7-4 win for the Crimson (15-8-4, 11-5-4 ECAC) over the Raiders (8-22-2, 4-14-2) on Saturday.
“[Senior Night] is such a great night, an emotional night,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “It just obviously makes it a lot more enjoyable when…we take care of business and get the win. It’s the right way for these guys to play their last regular season home game here.”
Coming out of the second intermission tied at three goals apiece, it looked as if junior Tyler Moy may have found the goal to put the Crimson ahead for good. Sophomore Seb Lloyd drove down the left side of the ice and found a streaking Moy, sending a puck across the middle that ricocheted off the junior’s skate and through the five-hole of Racine with 10:55 left in the third period.
But for the second straight night, after taking a one-goal lead in the third period, the advantage soon dissipated. Harvard failed to control a puck in its own zone along the boards, allowing junior Tim Harrison to skate free and find senior Tylor Spink on the doorstep. The senior faked a forehand shot to displace sophomore goaltender Merrick Madsen before equalizing with a backhand finish for his second goal of game less than a minute after Moy’s tally.
“We were playing with fire a little bit,” Vesey said. “We definitely want to get leads and then build on them. That’s something we’ll be working on.”
Colgate nearly forced the fourth tie of the night with just 70 seconds left in the game. Raider captain MIke Borkowski came in alone on Madsen, but the sophomore netminder was able to get his body on the puck and direct it over the net to protect the lead.
“Merrick came up with a couple big saves at the end,” Donato said. “We were able to find a way. We were resilient.”
While the game came down to the wire, it appeared early as if Harvard would assert control. On the Crimson’s first man-advantage of the game—thanks to a cross-checking call drawn by senior forward Greg Gozzo—three more seniors provided Harvard’s first offensive spark. Blackwell found co-captain Kyle Criscuolo at the bottom of the left circle; then the co-captain pivoted and sent a backhand pass to Vesey just above the crease, and the Crimson’s leading scorer beat goaltender Charlie Finn over the right shoulder to open the scoring 7:57 into the contest.

Less than three minutes later, Harvard added its second goal of the game. With just seconds remaining on a roughing penalty against Moy, sophomore Jake Horton intercepted a pass at the point and made his way into the offensive zone on an odd-man rush. He found junior Luke Esposito above the right circle, and the second-line center fired a shot that Finn slowed down but could not stop, as the puck trickled to the back of the net to give the Crimson a two-goal cushion. That shot would be the last Finn faced on the night, as he was immediately pulled in favor of Racine.
But just as it looked as if Harvard would assert control over the game, Tylor Spink’s first score of the night thwarted Harvard’s growing momentum. The Williamstown, Ont., native collected a rebound just to the left of Madsen and lifted the puck over the Flyers prospect’s outstretched left pad to cut the Crimson’s early lead to one.
Just over five minutes later, Darcy Murphy provided the equalizer that erased Harvard's early two-goal advantage. Off a Crimson turnover in its offensive zone, defenseman Willie Brooks found a streaking Murphy with space down the right wing. The senior picked his spot and threw a wrister on net, beating Madsen stick-side to knot the game up at two.
While the Harvard defense did concede four goals, it held strong on Colgate’s three power play opportunities, limiting the Raiders to one shot over three goalless efforts, including one early in the third period while the game was still tied.
“It wasn’t always pretty,” Vesey said. “But at the end of the day, we got it done and got the two points which moved us closer to a first-round bye.”
The Crimson now needs just one more point to secure a bye and home ice in the ECAC tournament quarterfinals.
In what will be his last regular season game at the Bright, senior goaltender Peter Traber saw his first action in net on the year, playing the last 39 seconds of the contest.
“We would have loved to break [the game] open and get [Traber] some more time,” Vesey said. “But we’re fired up that he got to get in at the end.”
Gozzo also saw his first minutes of the year as a member of the fourth line.
“He’s such a positive and emotional guy on the bench,” Donato said. “He fights for every inch and represents the type attitude we want our guys to have.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

­During the 2015-2016 season, the Harvard men’s basketball team has been plagued by games of runs, where the Crimson has been unable to put together a full 40 minutes.
It happened at Dartmouth, when the Big Green rode a 12-0 run to open the second half and come away with the double-digit victory. It happened at home against Cornell, where Harvard erased a 15-point deficit, only to give the lead right back and eventually fall by double-digits again. It happened at home against Columbia, when the Lions overcame a 16-point deficit to beat the Crimson on an Alex Rosenberg buzzer-beater.
But in Ithaca on Saturday night, Harvard finally found itself on the other end of an inconsistent game. After falling behind by 21 points with nine minutes remaining in the contest, the Crimson (11-15, 3-7 Ivy League) chipped away at the Big Red (9-15, 2-8) lead, and a baseline jumper by freshman guard Tommy McCarthy sealed the Harvard victory, 76-74.
MCCARTHY’S MOMENT
It was a battle of two freshman guards on Saturday night, with McCarthy facing off against Cornell phenom Matt Morgan, the Ivy League’s leading scorer.
While McCarthy and Morgan both led their teams in scoring, with 21 and 27, respectively, it was their play in the final seconds that will be remembered. After Harvard’s comeback, a dunk from junior Zena Edosomwan put the Crimson up three with 32 seconds to go. But Cornell wasn’t done fighting. Much like he had done all night, Morgan dribbled down the court and took control of the game on his own, launching an unassisted trey to tie the game at 74 with 24.5 seconds remaining.
On Harvard’s next possession, McCarthy received a pass from senior forward Agunwa Okolie just over half court. After dribbling down the clock to give Harvard a chance to take the final shot, McCarthy drove in traffic and hoisted a floater, putting the Crimson back up by two with 5.5 seconds to go. This time, Morgan could not respond, and Harvard walked away with its first Ivy road win of the year.
“I just tried to play with the flow of the game but I always like the ball in my hands at the end of the game,” McCarthy said. “It’s something I’ve always been good at in close games, end of the game, but I really love having the ball in my hands.”
But aside from making the game-winning shot, the rookie’s 21 points were a career high, and his play throughout the night demonstrated the improvements he has made over the course of the season. After averaging just 5.5 points a game through the month of January, McCarthy has improved to 10 per game in February. The Rancho Santa Fe, Calif., native is fourth in the Ivy League in assists and has been one of Harvard’s most consistent free throw shooters all year.
“I thought throughout the game he had a spirit and a vibe about him that was very positive,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “That kid Morgan, he’s an outstanding player, the shot he made to tie the game was just incredible, but Tommy’s performance, you know going against really good players, he steps his game up and really competed for us.”
DOMINATING THE GLASS
Throughout the season, Edosomwan has always told the press that it starts with rebounding. Even when he is struggling to find his shot, rebounds are a statistic based on effort. Harvard’s effort on the glass certainly showed on Saturday night, outrebounding the Big Red, 41-33.
More importantly, however, were the circumstances under which the rebounds came. The Crimson snagged 18 offensive rebounds compared to 10 for Cornell, including two consecutive grabs for Edosomwan which resulted in the dunk that put Harvard up three in the waning seconds.
“You know what, huge plays,” Amaker said of Edosomwan’s back-to-back offensive boards. “...[A]s fate would have it, his effort, his energy on the glass, resulted in the two points he got on the dunk. That’s the way you think basketball should be played and it was the right play at the end for a guy who really deserved it, and it was nice to see him get it.”
Harvard’s efforts on the offensive glass gave the team 17 second-chance points, compared to just four for the home team. Rebounding has plagued Cornell all year, as the Big Red rank last in the league in rebounds per game. While junior David Onuorah ranks fifth in the Ancient Eight in rebounds, the Big Red doesn’t have another player in the top 25. Harvard, meanwhile, has four players in the top 25, with Edosomwan being the top rebounder in the Ivy League.

It’s already the fourth, going on fifth, week of school and you’re just realizing that you have work to do. From piling up p-sets to enormous essays, it would have probably been better to start on your work at the beginning of the semester. But if you’re reading this, it might not be too late to get caught up in your classes.
First things first, you will need get organized. You need to make sure you are doing work that is actually due soon and not wasting your time on readings that are a lost cause. Writing down your priorities in a central location is a great way to not forget you might have a midterm the next day. Maybe on a strategically placed Post-It note on your desk or an obsessively color-coded Google Calendar. You might not be always on time for class but you will always know when it is.
Then, to finish on all those last minute projects, you need to find your place to work. Some people can’t work where they sleep because they will... sleep. Those who abandon all hope enter Lamont for an extended period of time. Try to find a space where you know you can and will get the most work done whether it is the relatively quiet hallway common room, the d-hall or the wonderfully noisy Starbucks in the Square.
But getting organized and finding your place of work doesn't mean anything if you are not actually doing the work. You will actually need to sit down and get pen to paper or hand to laptop. That's why you need to focus. Some people like to play music while they're reading or working to help them stay on track. Besides, you did buy that Spotify student plan for a reason or “borrow” your friend’s login and password.
Others can’t help but to look who at someone’s latest Insta pic (like ours) or play Neko Atsume over and over again. There are apps for your laptop and your phone like Self-Control in order to restrict access to certain websites and apps so you can finally work on the paper you avoided all this time. Maybe even use the Do Not Disturb function on your phone for a bit.
With all of this, you may catch up to all the work you have missed. Of course, that is until next semester.

We have finally gotten insight into the self-proclaimed “most influential human” on the earth: Kanye West, or, as he may like to be referred, Yeezus. Kanye has been dominating recent entertainment headlines with the release of his new album, The Life of Pablo / Waves / Swish / whatever name he’s decided for the upcoming week.
But even more interesting than his album is his chosen method of promoting himself: Twitter rants. First he went after Wiz Khalifa after he thought Wiz called out his wife, the equally Internet-famous (albeit for other reasons) Kim Kardashian. Then, he announced he was $53 million in debt, and needed the likes of Mark Zuckerberg to step in and “invest in the Kanye West ideas”. If these ideas are as inspirational as his Tweets, Flyby is ready to invest its massive social budget in the future of Kanye.
Pop quiz time. Some of the following are actual Kanye tweets, and some are Flyby originals. Which are which? Answers below.
A) “I AM THE MOST INFLUENTIAL PERSON ON THE PLANET. I AM GOD’S VESSEL TO THE WORLD.”
B) “I’d rather teachers get paid more and books cost less… #2020”
C) “Shut the *$%! up and enjoy the greatness”
D) "I hate when I'm on a flight and I wake up with a water bottle next to me like oh great now I gotta be responsible for this water bottle"
E) “Damn I’ll never see myself perform live. What I do for these people is life-changing.”
F) “World, please tweet, FaceTime, Facebook, instagram, whatever you gotta do to get Mark to support me…”
Thank you, Kanye, for entertaining us all with your #twitterfingers. We can’t wait for #Kanye2020.
Answers: Kanye West (B, C, D, F), Flyby (A, E)

Cultural Rhythms, the Harvard Foundation’s annual show celebrating Harvard’s diversity, was held Saturday afternoon and featured many student groups on campus as well as the gorgeous Lucy Liu (#tbt to Charlie’s Angels when we all wanted to grow up and become crime-fighting detectives) as this year’s Artist of the Year. Here are some of Flyby’s highlights from the show:
The Harvard Philippine Forum’s Sayaw sa BangkoWhile all of the student group performances were amazing, the Harvard Philippine Forum’s Sayaw sa Bangko, Tagalog for “Dance on Benches,” was so memorable. Seriously, they danced in pairs on narrow benches, then they jumped up and down said narrow benches, and then finally they stacked the narrow benches up and then danced and jumped from those heights– just wow. Members of the club explained afterwards that this traditional dance was a way for people from rural villages to get together and have fun spending time together.
Dean of Admissions William R. Fitzsimmons presented the Artist of the Year Award to Lucy LiuTo be honest, I was pretty excited to see Dean Fitzsimmons in the flesh, seeing as he was the one to sign off on all of our blessed emails and letters that we had gotten into Harvard. He then explained all of Lucy Liu’s accomplishments (FYI: she is an actor, producer, visual artist, and humanitarian), which consequently made me wonder what I’m doing with my life. But that’s a story for another time. He even pointed out that Liu had attended Stuyvesant High School, a school with an admissions rate lower than Harvard itself (uh what?!).
The rapport between the student hosts Hasani Hayden ‘19 and Faith Jackson ‘16The interludes between each act were exciting because the audience saw the progression between the on-stage relationship of Hayden and Jackson, who liked to throw shade at each other. One particular #burn I liked was when Hayden gave a shoutout to all his fellow freshmen in the crowd, to which Jackson gave a shoutout to everyone not taking Expos this year.

It has been almost nine years since J.K. Rowling blessed the world with the final written installment of the Harry Potter saga, but many fans are still in denial that the magic is actually over (Fred Weasley is still alive and you cannot convince us otherwise).
However on July 30th, all you Potterheads can finally abandon your slightly disturbing fan fiction, put aside your impressive DVD collection, and dust off your robes and owl cages because a brand new, Rowling-approved Harry Potter play called Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is debuting in London. And if that wasn’t enough to make you riddikulus-ly overwhelmed with excitement, on July 31st (which we all know to be the birthday of our favorite Chosen One) the script is being released as a book, which fans have been quick to call Harry Potter 8.
Yup, you read that right: NEW HARRY POTTER BOOK. (Well, sort of). Luckily enough for you, Flyby has the answers to all of your burning questions.
Is this real life??Yes. Lying about a new Harry Potter story is something only Dolores Umbridge would do, and as far as I know she isn’t behind any of this.
Ok, so it’s real. But is it a play? Or is it a book??First and foremost, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is a play. It’s going to debut on July 30th, 2016 at the Palace Theatre in London, and it will take place in two parts, meaning audiences will have to purchase tickets for two consecutive nights in order to get the full experience. And you thought Deathly Hallows was epic).
Wait, so how did the book version come about?Because not all fans of the series have figured out how to apparate across the pond, the lovely people behind the live show decided to release a print version of the story. While technically it is a script and not an actual novel, who is going to pass up the chance to read NEW HARRY POTTER? This is just about as magical as it gets.
HOLD UP. Did J.K. Rowling even write it?While the script was written primarily by a dude named Jack Thorne, Rowling contributed to the creation of the story line. So the answer is yes, Cursed Child is a pure blood.
How does this story fit in the existing timeline?If you’ve seen Rowling’s Twitter over the past couple of months, then you would already be aware that this is NOT a prequel and she wants everyone to know that. Seriously, that lady is not joking around here.
Actually, Cursed Child picks up where Deathly Hallows left off: 19 years after the Battle of Hogwarts when Harry and Ginny send their three sons off to learn magic (and manage mischief) in the hallowed halls of their alma mater. But nothing is ever simple for the Potters, and darkness awaits at every turn as little Albus Potter tries to deal with the legacy of his dad’s days as The Boy Who Lived. Oh, and apparently Harry might be having some kind of mid-life crisis involving his job at the Ministry. Like, seriously, can this dude just chill out for once and live a normal life?
Wait...who the heck is this “cursed child”? Wasn’t Harry cursed enough?Tbh, nobody really knows. However, going off of the available information it seems like the mysterious “cursed child” is Albus Severus Potter, Harry’s youngest son. What is the curse? Who even knows, but with a name as long and...unique…as that, the poor kid is bound to have problems.
Okay, so the play is in London and odds of getting there are slim...how can I get the book?Coming to a bookstore near you, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, get ‘em while they’re hot. Seriously though, the book is being released worldwide the day after the play premieres, both in print and on Pottermore (a.k.a. the website that you only signed up for to prove to your friends that no, you would not get sorted into Hufflepuff). So you’ve got several options for getting your hands on one of these bad boys.
Okay, one last question. Please tell me that we find out Fred Weasley never died and that it was actually just a very elaborate prank? Same with Sirius? What about Snape? Ugh and Dobby, PLEASE tell me Dobby comes back.Sure, they may have died in the books, but they will always be alive in the hearts of fans and those who truly believe. (What kind of monster would even ask such a question? I hope you get Hufflepuff on the next sorting quiz you take. Go back to Azkaban you soul-sucking dementor, you).
So there you have it, the answers to all of your Harry Potter-related questions. Now that you finally understand exactly what it is that will be released on July 31st, all that's left to do is work on your Patronus and patiently wait.
