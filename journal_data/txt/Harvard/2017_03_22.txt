After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One of the short skits featured in “SKETCH,” “Book Club,” features the unlikely interruption of a literary discussion by a stripper who insists on providing his services. The chaos only escalates with a gorilla suit, the arrival of another stripper, and a shoot-out. Channeling the creative genius of SNL, “SKETCH” is a student-run, written, and directed comedy performance that will feature ten independent skits in the Loeb Ex from March 23 to 25. Since the show’s debut three years ago, “SKETCH” has set itself apart from the more serious shows of its parent organization, the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club.
As fun as it is for the viewer, the actors equally enjoy performing in “SKETCH.” One of the stars of “Book Club,” Brooke E. Sweeney ’17, said of the show, “It’s just so ridiculous; it’s very kooky.”
In terms of the stage setup, stage director Mona Miao ’20 said, “The Loeb is a perfect space because you can engage with the audience more, as opposed to a traditional stage.” The interactive style will certainly increase the excitement of the show, since the actors have open access to the audience.
“SKETCH” also provided an opportunity for students to write their first comedy skits. John T. Ball ’20 said, “I haven’t done a sketch before or a student-written show before. It was my first chance to write skits.”
While the writers put a lot of time and energy into developing the script, actors often improvised to put their own spin on the scenes. Miao had a unique perspective on the process as a stage director. “Because I’m sitting in on rehearsals, it’s really cool to watch the process come together from the beginning when everyone is auditioning and then when the sketches are being written, to when people are trying the sketches, improvising, and overhauling the script,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Paul La Farge’s new novel “The Night Ocean” contains books within books within books, like a literary version of a Russian nesting doll. At the beginning of the novel, Marina, a psychotherapist, is dealing with the tragic suicide of her husband, Charlie Willett. However, the note he leaves and his missing body lead her to believe that he is not actually dead but committing pseucide—a faked suicide—instead. The novel then retraces the last few years of Charlie’s life as he collects information about famously eccentric fiction writer H. P. Lovecraft’s alleged affair with a young man.
The book begins with mystery: Is Charlie dead or is he faking it? La Farge takes the story to where it all began in over two hundred pages. While much of the beginning is relevant, at times it drags on for too long. There are a few too many pages of excerpts from the “Erotonomicon,” H. P. Lovecraft’s supposed erotic journal. Early on Charlie discovers the journal is a fraud and is determined to discover why anyone would write or publish a fake journal. Excessive portions of the novel are filled with details that quickly get debunked, to the point where many of the excerpts from the “Erotonomicon” feel redundant. La Farge then takes nearly one hundred pages to describe the life of Robert Barlow, the young man H. P. Lovecraft is supposed to have had an affair with. A thorough historical background of Lovecraft’s romantic life is thus established, but all this attention and detail to Barlow is less interesting to those who may be reading “The Night Ocean” for its mystery, which La Farge leads one to believe will be the focus of the story, than to those who are genuinely interested in the life of H. P. Lovecraft.
While the mystery is entertaining, the characters are less than charming. Charlie Willett, the main character, is unlikeable more often than not. From the glimpses we get into his life, he appears utterly consumed by his work and often takes his frustrations out on his wife. He constantly makes poor decisions and relies heavily on alcohol or prescriptions his wife writes for him. The narrator and Charlie’s wife, Marina, is a much more sympathetic character—thanks to the poor situations her husband puts her through—but remains relatively unappealing. Marina allows Charlie to walk all over her and doesn’t step in to help Charlie, even when he is clearly dealing with depression, until it is almost too late. It seems strange and inconsistent that Marina, a therapist, doesn’t realize the extent to which Charlie is suffering. Peripheral characters are often loathsome, hostile, or unhelpful, leaving the reader with very few characters to actually connect with.
La Farge also successfully explores some of the struggles of being homosexual in the 1940s and ’50s to add a more meaningful dimension to the novel. At the time, the discovery of gay men’s sexuality would mean unemployment and exile from their entire community. Those who were not ashamed of their sexuality were still forced to hide it from the general public and often times they were blackmailed by those who knew their secret. H. P. Lovecraft received a fair amount of backlash from his fan base when his homosexuality was revealed, showing that even those who loved his writing could not look past their disgust and homophobia to continue appreciating his work. Ironically, however, these same fans were able to overlook Lovecraft’s racist views. Many were content with reading the works of a racist man, but not the works of a gay man.

“In New Orleans in June the air is heavy with sex and death, not violent death but death by decay, overripeness, rotting, death by drowning, suffocation, fever of unknown etiology,” writes Joan Didion in the opening sentence of her newly published notebook “South and West” about these two American regions and cultures . In this first sentence, not only does Didion lure and dazzle her reader with seedy topics, but she perfectly encapsulates the frankness and excess that to her characterized the South in the 1970s. This stands in complete contrast to the equivocal, almost questioning observations regarding her native California that she makes in the second part of the collection. Though it consists mainly of succinct anecdotes and interviews, this notebook’s poignant observations and musings are fascinating thanks to Didion’s eye for detail and the relevance of the topics she discusses to this troubling world we live in today.
The first and largest excerpt, titled “Notes on the South,” details a road trip that Didion took in June 1970 through Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Didion took the trip on a whim and not on assignment, which likely contributed to the succinct and expressive writing that she uses throughout. Even with its punctuated, occasionally jotted-down notebook style, Didion manages to capture the spirit of the different cities she encounters and the locals she meets. Each anecdote begins with something as small as a local diner or a trip to the pool, but vividly proceeds to add to our understanding of the South during this time. Her observations are at times unfocused, but this is only natural in a notebook of recollection. If anything, the broken fragments create a scrapbook of the trip, as if the reader were flipping through sepia-tinted photographs in Didion’s own home.
She begins with her travels through New Orleans, painting its bourgeois side beautifully but undercutting it with a heavy dose of the irony that is perpetually present in her notes. In hopes of finding a sense of renewal or future in the South, Didion travels everywhere with a clear image in her mind of the South as a “secret source of malevolent and benevolent energy” that is slowly unraveled over the course of her visits. Instead, she finds that the South is not so simple, more often decaying and anachronistic. In other instances, it is more like wild, unpredictable overgrowth.
There is a strange undercurrent of eeriness that curiously flows through many of the scenes: “The snakes, the rotting undergrowth, sulphurous light; the images are so specifically those of the nightmare world that when we stopped for gas, or directions, I had to steel myself, deaden every nerve, in order to step from the car onto the crushed oyster shells in front of the gas station.” This imagery continues to feed into Didion’s depiction of the South as an almost alien planet. The views of the locals that she encounters are usually reported sans remark save for a string of questions tagged at the end. At times, it is refreshing to have these accompanied by Didion’s frank and often sardonic opinions. In one instance, a remark made about Southern girls as notorious husband hunters prompts Didion to write: “[H]ad I lived there I would have been an eccentric and full of anger, and I wondered what form the anger would have taken. Would I have taken up causes, or would I have simply knifed somebody?”
Didion also interviews locals who give fascinating portrayals of racism in a matter-of-fact tone that characterizes race relations as rigid and openly accepted. One white man tells her of the decrease of the influence of KKK in the Meridian community and the importance of racial harmony, but bluntly explains that he would not have a black minister at his home for dinner. Candid opinions such as these, expressed without the batting of an eye, come almost but not quite as a shock.
“Notes from California” is less focused on the external and is more interested in recounting parts of Didion’s own childhood. Her description focus on the trivial, such as her own thrifty habits and her grandmother’s prodigal ones, but as they accumulate they provide a better sense of her and her attempts to understand how she fits into the world she was born into. Though the two sections are unconnected, it is obvious that Didion is largely concerned with how to understand the American identity as a whole: “In the South they are convinced that they are capable of having bloodied their land with history. In the West we lack this conviction.” Though she doesn’t seem to ever reach a conclusion in answer to her questions, the open-endedness is perhaps what is most essential to this notebook’s project.

Sadly, around 11 out of every 12 members of the Class of 2020 did not win the housing lottery’s grand prize, and will not be beamed up to the Mathership. Some second and third prizes were bestowed upon other River East and non-Quad inductees, and I imagine the remaining contestants in the lottery will purchase bikes for themselves next year. 
Regardless of some of its less-favorable outcomes, Housing Day is a day filled with color and spirit and celebration. It is perhaps one of the few days of the year where Harvard students are filled with genuine joy and happiness in the company of dear friends and comrades, and a true day of unity that excludes no one (save for those unfortunate folks whose ever-socially-conscious professors and TFs schedule a midterm that morning, and for that unfortunate blocking group that Pfoho pforgot last year).
On this day, Harvard isn’t the dreary bureaucratic behemoth oblivious to the needs of its students that every single one of us has imagined it to be at some point. On this day, we unabashedly and unashamedly celebrate being a part of Harvard without constantly looking back over our shoulders at the “privilege” that got us here. On this day, at least for a few hours, divisions and factions only exist within House colors and crests. On this day, we’re not afraid to love our school.
On many other days, though, Harvard is on the receiving end of our contempt, annoyance, and grievances. There are certainly many just causes to petition the University for, and we are right to bring forth dissent, discussion, and even demands. It is often out of love for our school and our classmates that we seek the administration’s ear. But more often than not, one of the most prestigious colleges in the world is never quite good enough for us.
The Crimson’s editorial page is perhaps uniquely reflective of much of this malcontent. From all leanings, the Harvard administration either ignores this group or that one, provides insufficient funding for another one, makes a bone-headed policy decision that might harm people, hires too many or too few professors of whatever identity marker or ideology, is a greedy capitalist extortioner or the Kremlin on the Charles, et cetera. Most of these opinions are well-reasoned and rational. But for goodness’ sake, we sure complain a lot, and we don’t seem to have many good things to say about Harvard, or each other.
Other Harvard students themselves are tragically often on the receiving end of our displeasure. We don’t publicly accost each other or condemn one another, but rather we lament that other students who don’t look like us, act like us, or think like us just don’t understand us and never will. We assume that students from this background or that one could never possibly understand what it means to be us, and therefore are not worth engaging with, or are sometimes even worth our ill will or derision. By segregating ourselves into identity groups, we necessarily create outsiders. Outsiders are generally not treated well by insiders.
Harvard and its student body aren’t perfect, and again, we justly strive to correct egregious imperfections. I’m certainly guilty of grievances against Harvard and heck, I’ve even got a Crimson column as a stump and megaphone.
But Harvard is still an amazing place to be, and I would be loath to forget it. I wrote this cycle’s column in a Widener reading room atop stories’ worth of books and knowledge and scholarship, walked down the library steps through who-knows-how-many tourists’ pictures, and strode the same paths of the Yard that presidents, generals, doctors, lawyers, and countless other history-makers have trod. How blessed I am to have met such phenomenal friends and comrades, and to have been afforded such a wealth of opportunities during my time here!
Who among the student body could forget where they were, or who they were with, or how they felt when they opened the acceptance email that would change their lives? Who could forget the stupefaction of realizing that they were to inherit such a storied legacy? To be sure, the luster of that legacy is marked with some dents and dings. Our inheritance imbues us with no small task of stewardship, and good stewards will ask difficult and challenging things of their peers and of their institution.
The nature of a university that prides itself on shaping tomorrow’s leaders, with its students bursting at the seams to get out and change the world, does not always lend itself well to gratitude or appreciation for the old alma mater. But Housing Day was a reminder that there is so much that we love about this University and about our classmates. It cannot possibly hurt us to acknowledge these things a little more often.
Harvard is not simply the other party in a transaction of education, but a part of who we are. So at least for today, unreservedly, here’s to Harvard and everything we love about it.

As Harvard alums who have represented dozens of students involved in sexual misconduct accusations on campuses nationwide, we read with concern the March 10 Crimson article revealing that Harvard College may adopt an affirmative consent policy in sexual misconduct cases. This would be a grave mistake.
The main problem with affirmative consent policies is that they don't match how people have sex in the real world, including on college campuses. They are a classic example of policies that sound good in theory but break down in practice.
After all, isn’t it important that people make sure that they have consent for sex? How could it be bad to codify that requirement in the clearest possible terms?
The problem is that what seems clear in principle is often decidedly less so in practice. Most affirmative consent policies, for example, say that consent may only be expressed through unambiguous words or actions. On its face, that is clear enough. Expressing unambiguous verbal consent only takes one word: “Yes.”
Requiring verbal consent seems that it would simplify proof in sexual assault accusations, but it doesn’t. We have seen multiple cases where the complainant acknowledged that they said yes, but claimed that they did not mean it, or that they non-verbally withdrew the consent later. The accused was found responsible for sexual assault in these cases.
Requiring verbal consent is also patronizing. In our day, “no” meant “no,” and we assumed that everyone was capable of speaking the word during an encounter. To our minds, it is decidedly anti-feminist to tell non-incapacitated, sexually active adults that they lack the agency to say no, which is what affirmative verbal consent policies do.
This brings us to consent through actions. This is where, as most communist nations eventually discovered, what sounds great in theory can be a disaster in practice.
What does unambiguous consent through actions look like? Consider, for example, the last time you had intercourse without verbal consent. How did you know the other person wanted to do it? What one thing would you be able to point to? Was it the kissing? The touching? Some other sexual act that happened right before intercourse that you both just seemed to enjoy?
If you point to any one thing and say that’s what made me think I had consent, you’re going to be found responsible for sexual misconduct. That’s because most sexual misconduct policies explicitly say that consent for one sexual act does not imply consent for another sexual act. So if you say, “I thought because she put my hand on X, she wanted Y,” you’re toast. Goodbye, Harvard. Hello, East Whoville College (if you’re lucky).
The problem is that consent through actions is all about context. It’s not any single thing, especially when the participants are in a romantic relationship. There is usually a natural progression in sexual contact. Partners start off by kissing and gradually escalate, barring any objections.
But when sexual misconduct panels try to break down exactly where the consent through actions happened, that analysis inevitably becomes absurd. Panelists ask questions like, “Did the fact that you had oral sex mean you thought he or she was consenting to intercourse? At what point did you think you had consent?”
The honest answer is usually, “It wasn’t any one thing. It was everything that happened that night. She seemed just as into it as I was.”
But universities, in our experience, default to punishing the accused in these ambiguous cases. Breaking down how consent-through-actions was communicated, in the cold light of a conference room months or even years later, is impossible. The practical result is that the affirmative consent policy allows any student to get his or her former sex partners expelled or suspended.
While it's important to make sure that sexual misconduct is handled appropriately on campus, affirmative consent policies do not help to achieve this goal. Harvard should resist the temptation to adopt a policy that makes sense on paper but can needlessly ruin lives in practice.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the midst of a late-season snowstorm and a campus largely closed for the week, students staying at the College over spring break were faced with another obstacle in feeding themselves: the introduction of Crimson Cash grants to replace the pilot cash grant program used last year. These grants, which are reserved for students on substantial financial aid, aim to ensure that students do not need to dig into their own finances to buy groceries while staying on campus. All dining halls are closed during spring break, a significant problem for the students who find it financially inviable to fly home for their week off from classes.
While we applaud the College attempting to ease the financial burden of grocery shopping for low-income students, its method of doing so is unfortunately excessively restrictive and paternalistic. Crimson Cash can only be used at a handful of locations in the Square, many of which are high-end restaurants and thus impractical for students on a budget. Only two grocery stores, Broadway Marketplace and H Mart, accept Crimson Cash, making it impossible for students wishing to shop at cheaper options in the neighborhood to do so. Additionally, for students with dietary restrictions or allergies, finding healthy options at the highly limited range of restaurants open to them can be prohibitively difficult.
The most equitable way for Harvard to assist low-income students is by keeping at least one dining hall open during break, a method used two years ago. There are many students who do not fit the College’s criteria for receiving spring break grants, yet still struggle to afford the cost of food for the week. Keeping a dining hall open enables these students to feed themselves as well, and can also foster a sense of community over the break as students share meals in an accessible, free location that meets most dietary restrictions.
Regardless, students, not the College, are best equipped to buy the food that meets their needs. If factors such as worker contracts and cost of keeping a dining hall running over break impede with the College’s ability to keep dining halls open, returning to a cash grant system would enable students to purchase nutritious groceries that accommodate any dietary restrictions. This method would also be more affordable. Rather than having to spend their Crimson Cash grants at the Square’s high-end restaurants and potentially run out of money before the dining halls reopen, students could stock up on groceries to last them all of break. No students should have to worry about affording food over spring break or using their own savings to purchase meals for the week.
We urge Harvard to rethink how it distributes aid over break. Students know their own dietary needs better than the College does. An open dining hall or cash grant provides flexibility, which is more important than a Harvard-subsidized steak dinner in the Square.

In the early days, Feng Zhang ’04 and his lab ate a lot of late-night Chinese food.
This was before Zhang published the seminal 2013 paper that earned him international acclaim, redefined an entire scientific field, and brought scientists one step closer to curing diseases like cancer. The technology Zhang debuted in that paper, called CRISPR-Cas9, offers a precise and inexpensive way to edit the human genome.
CRISPR-Cas9, sometimes shortened to CRISPR, is as controversial as it is revolutionary. A sort of molecular scissors, scienists predict the gene-editing tool may one day allow scientists to clip disease out of the genome. But it could also usher in an era in which expecting parents select their child’s personality, looks, and intelligence in advance—like ordering items off a menu.
In the run-up to publication, Zhang says, everyone in the lab put in extra hours, staying late and returning early the next morning. Regardless, he insists that no one felt like “we were doing hard work.”
“We were having fun, we were trying to solve interesting problems together, time went by without even noticing,” he says. “We would eat dinner around five and then eat dinner around 10 again… We would pick up Chinese deliveries and just eat together in the kitchen and go back to work right after.”
Leaning forward in his pristine 10th-floor corner office at the Broad Institute, a Harvard-MIT genetics research center in the heart of Cambridge, Zhang steeples his fingers and smiles, remembering.
“I tried to build the lab as a start-up environment by putting together or recruiting people who are deeply passionate,” he says. “There was just this energy.”
That “feeling of energy” continues today, Zhang is quick to add. Advances have come at rapid-fire pace—this month alone, an influential federal science panel released a report endorsing CRISPR-mediated modification of human embryos; a day later, the United States patent office ended a longstanding patent dispute between Zhang’s lab and a lab at the University of California by ruling in Zhang’s favor.
Zhang says he is excited for the future. And his lab still orders more Chinese takeout than any other lab in the Broad Institute, probably.
It was late 2011, and Zhang says was getting frustrated. Earlier in his career, he’d advanced quickly: After graduating from Harvard, where he concentrated in chemistry and physics and helped author a paper showing how flu viruses enter cells, he’d obtained a doctorate in chemical and biological engineering at Stanford. While he was there, Zhang—along with two other scientists—invented optogenetics, a technique that today allows neuroscientists around the globe to better study and understand neural disorders like depression and schizophrenia.
But, when he returned to Cambridge six years ago, Zhang says he felt stymied. He had become fascinated by the idea of gene-editing, but was increasingly disappointed with the editing tools available.
The two editing technologies then in use—zinc finger nucleases and transcription activator-like effector (TALE) nucleases—were “challenging,” “cumbersome,” and “difficult” to use, Zhang says. Zinc finger and TALE nucleases required months of preparation and lots of finicky “molecular biology manipulation.”
Zhang had been “pretty excited” to show students in his lab how to engineer their own TALE nucleases. Now he wanted something better.
In early 2011, he found it. Zhang was listening to a presentation by Harvard Medical School professor Michael S. Gilmore and “getting bored,” when Gilmore said the word “nuclease.”
“That caught my attention,” Zhang recalls.
Gilmore, who studies bacteria, was describing a bacterial system known as CRISPR that encoded nucleases, which are enzymes that can cleave DNA. Zhang decided he wanted to know more, so he Googled CRISPR and found its Wikipedia page.
“I realized this is really cool,” Zhang says. “If we can harness this system, [gene editing] could be a lot easier.”
“So that’s how I got started,” he adds.
CRISPR—short for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Palindromic Repeats—is used by bacteria to fend off invading viruses. Zhang discovered he could repurpose CRISPR to edit plant and animal (including human) DNA: The system could be targeted to different sections of the genome, where a CRISPR-associated protein called Cas9 would step in to snip the selected DNA.
Zhang’s invention was a major step forward. James F. Angstman, a graduate student in the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology who works with CRISPR as part of his research, describes going from zinc finger and TALE nucleases to CRISPR-Cas9 as going “from a horse-and-buggy to a car.”
“They both get you from point A to point B, but one way is way, way easier to make and to maintain and to implement,” Angstman says.
David Cox, a student at the Medical School who works in Zhang’s lab, puts it this way: Before CRISPR-Cas9, “the limiting thing for a lot of interesting biological questions was just the tools with which to ask those questions.”
CRISPR-Cas9’s popularity has exploded since Zhang published his paper. From 2013 to early 2017, 4,429 published scientific studies around the world used the technology, according to a STAT News analysis.
“Before CRISPR came out, not a lot of people were willing to put in the time or effort to make it happen, and I think the really exciting thing about CRISPR is now pretty much anyone [can do gene editing],” Angstman says. “The kind of democratization of gene editing is the really exciting part.”
In science, timing is paramount. Credit for any discovery goes only to the group that publishes first.
For the past year, Zhang and the Broad Institute have been embroiled in a patent battle to decide who won the CRISPR race: the Zhang lab or a University of California at Berkeley group led by Jennifer A. Doudna, working in collaboration with Emmanuelle M. Charpentier of Sweden’s Umea University.
Back in 2011 and 2012, as Zhang and his group were spending late, CRISPR-filled nights at the lab, Doudna and her colleagues on the opposite coast were doing the same.
The two women beat Zhang to publication. In June 2012, almost half a year before Zhang’s article would appear, Doudna and Charpentier published a paper demonstrating that CRISPR could be used to target and cut various stretches of the genome.
But there were crucial differences. The Doudna-Charpentier paper only proved that CRISPR could slice DNA in a test tube; Zhang’s report showed CRISPR worked inside both human and mouse cells. Moreover, Doudna and Charpentier’s version of CRISPR used different molecules and lacked “critical components” required to make the technology function in living systems, Zhang told STAT.
Zhang and the Doudna-Charpentier team both applied for CRISPR patents in 2013; Doudna and Charpentier filed their application in March, Zhang a few months later in October. In April 2014, the United States patent office awarded MIT a patent for using CRISPR-Cas9 to edit plant and animal DNA and listed Zhang as the primary inventor.
UC Berkeley appealed the decision, arguing that Doudna and Charpentier deserved credit for CRISPR, not Zhang. Doudna and Charpentier contend that Zhang’s paper merely builds on their work—in their view, they drew up the architectural blueprint for the house; Zhang just switched paint colors and fiddled with the molding.
Zhang disagrees. Not only did he come up with the idea of using CRISPR in animal cells before Doudna and Charpentier did, but his version of the technology is designed differently, Zhang told STAT. Now, 13 months after the patent office first agreed to investigate UC Berkeley’s patent complaints, the government has sided with Zhang.
The patent board ruled last month that CRISPR patents belong to the Broad Institute, writing in its decision that Zhang’s use of CRISPR in mouse and human cells “would not have been obvious” from the Doudna-Charpentier paper. In other words, Zhang and the Doudna-Charpentier team planned and built different houses.
Glancing at the Boston skysline spread across his office windows, Zhang—a little over two weeks after the patent office ruling—says he is glad to “have some resolution on that front.” He adds he is especially happy he can focus on science again.
“I think what is really exciting is that I get to spend my time and all my effort working on research and trying to discover new things and new technologies,” Zhang says.
Doudna and members of the UC Berkeley lab did not respond to requests for comment for this article.
Zhang says he thinks the patent fight has ultimately been “a distraction from the science,” and adds he is glad progress on CRISPR has not been “impeded” too much by the conflict. He pauses, and rests his elbows on the arms of his desk chair.
“There are many different contributions from many groups around the world and each one of their contributions adds something,” he says. “I think this is really good overall.”
Zhang’s lab continues to work at a frenzied pace. They have a lot to do—CRISPR-Cas9 has potential applications in fields ranging from therapeutics to farming (it could be used, for example, to genetically engineer crops that require less fertilizer).
Many have balked at the possibility that CRISPR could also be used to genetically engineer babies. After a February 2017 ruling by a United States science panel—convened by the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Medicine—that CRISPR can be used to delete genes known to cause “serious diseases and disability” from human embryo DNA, the era of the “designer baby” seems closer than ever before.
Zhang says only that he thinks “we need to be very thoughtful and very careful” going forward.
But he has other things to think about. A little less than two years ago, he and his wife had a little girl, their first child.
Nowadays, while Zhang’s labmates stay late at work, munching on scallion pancakes and beef with rice, Zhang heads home. He says he wants to “spend more time” with his toddler (though he admits he’ll “soon get back on the computer.”)
He says he has not discussed CRISPR with his daughter.
“I don’t think she has any idea,” Zhang says, laughing at the suggestion.
She does not yet know the world she inherits may be shaped, in part, by her father’s invention.

In September 2011, Former University President Derek C. Bok faced a scene he once thought impossible: close to 1,000 black Law School graduates, many of them leaders in their fields, eating, chatting, and laughing together.
The Law School was holding its third-ever Celebration of Black Alumni. More than 700 graduates made the trip back to campus for the three-day event.
Forty years after serving as Dean of the Law School, Bok, too, had returned to Harvard. On the final day of the gathering, Bok and former Law School assistant director of admissions Walter J. Leonard both received the Law School Medal of Freedom Award for their work in diversifying the school. Over the course of Bok’s tenure as Dean, the two substantially increased the number of women and minority students at the Law School.
After accepting his award, Bok sat down to a celebratory brunch in a large white tent packed with black alumni—and was struck “powerfully” by what he saw.
“Given how this whole process had started, when we had such a long way to go and our early efforts were really quite desperate to change these historic patterns, and then to see these hundreds of alumni…” Bok remembers.
Bok recalls how, after the meal, alumni “clustered” round him to introduce themselves. He met dozens of court judges, law firm partners, and—this he particularly remembers—pharmaceutical company Merck CEO Ken Frazier, who graduated from the Law School in 1978.
“You had before you the living, breathing example of what it was all about, these people who are playing important positions in the law when there were so few at the beginning. It was a very moving experience,” Bok adds.
When Bok was appointed University President in 1971, he made Leonard his special assistant and set to work diversifying the student body. Together, Bok and Leonard developed the “Harvard Plan,” an admissions policy applied across Harvard’s schools that allowed recruiters to take into account applicants’ race and ethnicity.
Bok and Leonard’s implementation of the policy—more commonly known as affirmative action—in the 1970s set a national precedent, causing universities across the United States to adopt similar standards. But the Harvard Plan has also become a lightning rod for criticism of race-conscious admissions.
Critics of affirmative action have argued that the policy discriminates against white—and more recently, Asian-American—students. And, given that most elite private colleges do not disclose how they take race into account in admissions, some detractors have claimed the closed-door nature of the process invites misconduct.
The American debate surrounding race-conscious admissions has centered, to a large extent, on Harvard. Since being held up as a gold standard in a precedent-setting Supreme Court case, the University’s race-conscious admissions system has come under intense scrutiny and attack in the past few decades.
In the late 1980s, the U.S Education Department launched an investigation to determine whether Harvard was illegally using racial quotas to deny deserving Asian Americans admittance to the school. After two years, the Department ruled in Harvard’s favor, concluding no quotas had been used.
Three decades later, in November 2014, a nonprofit group called Students for Fair Admissions launched a lawsuit against the University, claiming Harvard’s admissions practices unfairly limit the number of Asian Americans admitted to the school. The lawsuit, which is ongoing, has garnered national attention and sparked debate on college campuses from coast to coast.
Harvard has denied any discrimination against Asian-American applicants.
The lawsuit, now stretching into its fourth year, is the latest manifestation of a long-running trend: Harvard’s high profile and steadfast commitment to affirmative action renders the University an attractive target for those seeking to topple race-conscious admissions across the country.
But Harvard was not always an exemplar of diversity. Bok says he first developed affirmative action in part to bring variety to Harvard’s then-overwhelmingly white and all-male student body.
In the early 1950s, just a few years before Bok assumed the Presidency, then-Dean of Admissions Wilbur J. Bender ’57 described the ideal Harvard student desired by “critical alumni” in a letter to then-University Provost Paul H. Buck.
“[He is] the well-dressed, polite, Nordic blonde from a family with an income of $20,000 a year and up, living in a swanky suburb,” Bender wrote. “These are the boys who make the fraternities… they go on into insurance or bond selling or advertising or what not and become the background of the Country Club set and have lots of divorces.”
Bender wrote in 1953 that many alumni were worried Harvard was “losing its appeal” for this “one special kind of boy.” Roughly 20 years later, Bok would realize these alums’ worst fears, and make a conscious decision to invite more than just the “Country Club set” into Harvard’s halls.
“We tried not just to have statistical diversity of all kinds in admissions statistics but to try to encourage a lot of interaction so people do learn from groups that have had rather different experiences than their own,” Bok says, reflecting on the early rollout of affirmative action. “We saw educational advantages for everyone.”
Since the 1970s, Harvard has not wavered from Bok’s position: Race continues to be taken into account during the admissions process. Diversity, the University has repeatedly argued, enhances every student’s experience at Harvard.
But Harvard’s approach to admissions has had consequences beyond diversifying the crop of students who set foot on campus each fall—it has also become a national standard for race-conscious admissions.
Matthew M. Cregor, who works for a legal group—the Lawyer’s Committee for Civil Rights and Economic Justice—that is helping to defend Harvard in the current admissions lawsuit, says a brief filed by Harvard helped decide the landmark Supreme Court case on issues of race-based admissions.
That case, Regents of the University of California v. Allan Bakke, began in 1974 when would-be medical student Bakke, then 38, sued University of California Davis School of Medicine after he applied and was rejected. Bakke claimed that less-qualified minority students had been admitted to Davis in his stead under a special minority admissions program.
Bakke’s case reached the Court in 1978; Harvard filed an amicus brief in support of Davis’s minority admissions program around that time. In its brief, Harvard argued for the benefits of race-conscious admissions and outlined relevant methods employed by admissions officials.
“If Harvard College is to continue to offer a first-rate education to its students, minority representation in the undergraduate body cannot be ignored,” the brief reads. “Race has been a factor in some admissions decisions… a black student can usually bring something that a white person cannot offer.”
The brief went on to note, however, that Harvard “has not set target quotas for the number of blacks” or other minority groups to be admitted in a given year. Instead, the College’s Committee on Admissions “pays some attention to distribution among many types and categories of students.”
In its final 5-4 decision, the Court struck down racial quotas but upheld some forms of affirmative action. Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr., who wrote the principal opinion, cited the “Harvard College program” as a paragon of race-conscious admissions and included the text of the Harvard brief in the appendix.
“[The brief] really helped convince the Supreme Court that our schools must be allowed to value diversity in a way that enables future leaders to learn from and with each other,” Cregor says. “The last 30 years plus of race-conscious admissions has been based on this notion of diversity.”
“Through the years, as the U.S. Supreme Court has looked at these issues, one of the voices that has been most convincing to the court on, ‘Are universities required to use race conscious factors?’ has been Harvard’s,” Cregor adds.
As Harvard has become a national standard for constitutional affirmative action, it has also become a target for conservative activists.
One such activist is Edward Blum.
Blum is not a lawyer or a scorned college applicant, but a conservative provocateur who has made a career going after civil rights policies. His lawsuit against Harvard is just his latest effort.
Because of Blum’s work in 2013, the Supreme Court struck down a provision of the 1965 Voting Rights Act that required some Southern states to gain Justice Department approval before changing their election laws. While Blum says this decision eliminated  “racial gerrymandering,” his liberal critics counter that this has allowed those states to make restrictive voter I.D. laws that target minorities.
Recently, Blum was behind the landmark affirmative action case  Fisher vs. University of Texas at Austin.
In Fisher v. Texas, Blum sought out Abigail Fisher, the daughter of a former business colleague, who claimed she was denied admission to the University of Texas at Austin because she was white. But her grades and test scores would not have led to her acceptance even if she had been black, according to documents filed by the university.
Harvard filed a 27-page amicus curiae brief in support of the University of Texas at Austin in November 2015.
“It is more apparent now than ever that maintaining a diverse student body is essential to Harvard’s goals of providing its students with the most robust educational experience possible on campus and preparing its graduates to thrive in a complex and stunningly diverse nation and world,” the brief reads. “These goals, moreover, are not held by Harvard alone, but are shared by many other universities that, like Harvard, have seen through decades of experience the transformative importance of student body diversity on the educational process.”
As Fisher bounced around the lower courts, Blum decided to try a different tack. Operating through his legal defense fund, Project on Fair Representation, he launched a website soliciting students who had been rejected by Harvard to join a new suit. Fisher, centered on a white plaintiff, had stalled. Blum’s new site featured a dejected-looking Asian woman instead.
“Were You Denied Admission to Harvard?” it read. “It may be because you’re the wrong race.”
Despite these recruiting efforts, the plaintiff in Blum’s latest attempt to attack affirmative action is not a recognizable face like Abigail Fisher, but a non-profit organization that he founded in 2014 and directs, Students for Fair Admissions.
The non-profit’s legal filings cite a single, anonymous Asian-American student who was denied admission to Harvard.
Meanwhile, Blum shepherded Fisher’s case back up to the Supreme Court for a second try. The national debate over affirmative action came to a head in 2016, as the Supreme Court ruled 4-3 in favor of the University of Texas at Austin.
On the national stage, it seemed, the question had been answered. In June, Law professor Laurence H. Tribe ’62 called the ruling a “decisive victory” for Harvard.
But Blum isn’t done.
“There should be no place for race in college admissions. There should be no place for ethnicity. There should be no place for religion. There should be no place for gender or gender identification,” he says. “These things we are born with. These immutable factors do not define who we are as individuals.”
The legal battle at Harvard began in November 2014, when Blum’s nonprofit, Students for Fair Admissions, filed a complaint alleging that Harvard employs quotas for Asian-Americans students.
“As in the past, [Harvard] will use any leeway the Supreme Court grants them to use racial preferences in college admissions—under whatever rubric—to engage in racial stereotyping, discrimination against disfavored minorities, and quotasetting to advance their social-engineering agenda,” the complaint reads. “Strict scrutiny has proven to be no match for concerted discrimination hidden behind the veil of “holistic” admissions.”
“Harvard is not only limiting the number of Asians they will accept, but they’re also racially balancing every other race and ethnicity,” Blum says in an interview. “Both of those fall afoul of longstanding judicial precedent.”
Many have criticized Blum’s various attempts to attack affirmative action.
“The revenues that Mr. Blum seeks are the exact same ones he sought in Fisher and in other cases, which is an absolute prohibition on any University’s ability to use race conscious factors in admitting and enrolling its students,” Cregor says. “Mr. Blum and others have been licking their chops for this case for a long time and he’s chosen a most unfortunate means to go after it.”
During the discovery process—a pre-trial period where each party seeks evidence from the other—in May 2015, Students For Fair Admissions requested access to admissions data and was denied. But in September 2016, the presiding judge ruled that Harvard must provide the court with six cycles of admissions data.
“I just don’t think there’s going to be a smoking gun,” Parke Muth, an admissions consultant and former admissions officer at the University of Virginia, says. “I just think it’s very hard to demonstrate when you have holistic admissions that you’re outright breaking the law.”
Kim M. Williams, a Kennedy School professor who studies race and immigration in American politics,  says those accusing Harvard of using quotas have the wrong picture of the admissions process.
“I think the reality is that people have a very metrics-oriented sense of what’s happening in admissions, and that’s just not the case,” she says.
In a statement, Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven says that Harvard College does not maintain quotas of any kind.
“Our admissions process considers each applicant as a whole person, and we review a great number of factors, including an applicant’s academic qualifications, as well as a wide variety of personal factors,” she wrote.
The discovery process is ongoing and could last through 2018. If things go differently than they did in the Fisher case, Blum says he is hopeful there will be lasting reverberations.
“I think if Harvard’s admissions policies are struck down as impermissible racial quotas, it will send a very loud signal to other schools that have been discriminating against Asians and racially balancing their student bodies,” he says.
Blum is not the first to accuse Harvard of discriminating specifically against Asian-American applicants. Roughly 30 years before Blum and Students for Fair Admissions filed their lawsuit, the United States Department of Education investigated the University’s admissions processes and found that there was no wrongdoing.
In 1988, the Education Department’s Office of Civil Rights embarked on a two-year-long investigation of Harvard’s admissions office, responding to allegations that the University was using racial quotas to deny Asian Americans admission.
The Office for Civil Rights concluded its investigation in 1990, ultimately finding that Harvard had not used quotas and was therefore not in violation of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which outlaws discrimination based on race, sex, religion, or nationality.
At the time, Law professor emeritus Alan M. Dershowitz was vocal about his criticism of the department’s findings. Today, he remains a critic of the treatment Asian-American students in admissions processes.
“I don’t think there’s any doubt that many major universities today set a higher bar for admission for Asian-American students and several admissions officers have acknowledged it, saying if we went only by the numbers—grades, scores, and SAT scores—there would be a very much larger percentage of Asian-Americans admitted, and I think that’s not fair,” he says.
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith says he worries how perceptions that Asian-Americans have a harder time getting admitted to Harvard will affect students.
“We work very hard to communicate what we actually believe in the face of those perceptions,” he says. I’m a strong advocate for diversity of all kinds amongst our students.”
In response to the question of comparatively higher SAT scores for admitted Asian-American students at the time of the inquiry, the admissions office released a statement in 1988 arguing this was due to the low proportion of Asian-American students who were either children of alumni or recruited athletes.
Bok himself also publicly defended the University’s admissions practices at the time. Now, reflecting on the 1990 inquiry and the more recent 2014 lawsuit, Bok says he believes challenges to affirmative action may stem from a fundamental misreading of the program.
“A lot of people misunderstand this whole policy by thinking it’s some kind of outgrowth of the liberal conscience of leftwing universities and we’re trying to make up for all sorts of past misdeeds,” he says. “We’re not just trying to make up for past sins, we’re trying to build a better society, and that’s not just a crazy academic idea.”
More recently, outspoken conservative Ron K. Unz ’83 criticized Harvard’s treatment of Asian Americans in the admissions process. Last spring, a group of alumni led by Unz ran for Harvard’s Board of Overseers, the University’s second-highest governing body, on a platform that accused Harvard of using quotas for Asian Americans and pledged to reform the University’s admissions policies.
Jeannie Park ’83, who co-founded an alumni group formed to oppose Unz’s ticket, calls his platform a “stealth approach against affirmative action.”
“I think that obviously diversity at the University is one of the main values of a Harvard education and it’s what so many of us as alumni feel that we remember most and value most about our time at Harvard,” she says.
Harvard’s Asian American Association recently distributed a survey to their members about affirmative action. In a statement on their website, they wrote that most participants “thought that while affirmative action on the whole is a good idea, race does play a significant role in Harvard admissions and the current policies implemented at Harvard at worst have a negative effect on Asian American applicants and at best have no benefit.”
Despite worries about the place of race in Harvard’s admissions processes, the statement concludes that “Unanimously, survey respondents agreed that diversity enriches the college experience overall.”
In a further challenge to Harvard’s policies in May 2015, 64 Asian American groups filed a complaint against Harvard with the U.S. Departments of Education and Justice, citing Blum’s lawsuit.
But AAA’s statement noted that 75 percent of the Asian-American organizations that signed the complaint opposing Harvard’s policies were Chinese community groups, meaning other Asian nationalities were less well-represented.
“Asian American, as the name suggests, comprises a much larger and more diverse population than that of just East Asians (China, Japan, Korea),” the statement reads. “But groups like the ones above that criticize affirmative action as an idea must also recognize the diversity within the Asian American community itself and realize affirmative action’s benefits for other ethnicities within the Asian American diaspora.”
Today’s conservative critics of  Harvard’s admissions processes often refer to a dark chapter in the University’s history to further their claims.
Blum says that Harvard stuck out to him as “the most egregious discriminator” among peer institutions.
“Harvard has a long, ugly history of discrimination,” Blum says.
Blum is referring to the tenure of President Abbott Lawrence Lowell.
In an attempt to expand the student body beyond pupils from elite boarding schools, the admissions committee of Lowell’s day instituted a rule that required the University to reach out to male students in the top seventh of their class. In response, Lowell moved toward a model of admissions that required not just good scores but demonstrations of “character” through interviews and recommendation letters.
Under this guise, Lowell was able to limit the school’s diversity. His particular target was Jewish students, whose ranks had swelled to more than twenty percent of the student population in 1922.
“Harvard moved toward a holistic admissions which basically allowed them to deny Jewish students because they were Jewish, but you didn’t have to say that, you could say ‘Well they wouldn’t fit in,’” Muth, an admissions expert, says.
Lowell attempted to establish a direct quota that would limit the number of Jewish students to fifteen percent of the student body, but was overruled.
In a 1922 letter to Alfred A. Benesch ‘00, Lowell wrote “If [the] number [of Jews] should become 40 percent of the student body, the race feeling would become intense. If every college in the country would take a limited proportion of Jews, I suspect we should go a long way toward eliminating race feeling among students.”
In his complaint, Blum alleges that Harvard has a quota for the number of Asian-American students it will accept each year.
However, not everyone feels that the analogy is appropriate. In October court proceedings, the judge referred to SFFA’s lawyer’s insistence on bringing up Lowell’s policies as a “red herring time suck.”
Dershowitz, who mentioned Lowell’s policies in a recent book, says this “long, terrible history of discrimination” needs to be acknowledged by Harvard today.
“[Lowell] was a bigot of the worst order and there should be no house named after him,” he says. “Talk about changing names, if you’re going to change names, the first one to go should be Lowell.”
Though Blum’s three-year-old lawsuit has sparked some renewed criticism of Harvard’s race-conscious admissions policies, it has also prompted others to step forward in defense of the University.
In April 2015, a group of 14 prospective, current, and former College students—all represented by the pro bono legal group Lawyer’s Committee for Civil Rights and Economic Justice—filed a motion seeking to intervene in the lawsuit in Harvard’s favor. The students hoped to offer personal testimonies to the value of diversity at the University.
But a panel of judges denied the request, and instead granted the students amicus status in the case, meaning they can submit briefs and participate in oral arguments.
Last year, two high school students who hope to attend the College filed a legal brief supporting Harvard’s race-conscious admissions process. In January 2017, judges granted these two students amicus status, too.
One of these students—Jason Fong, a high school senior from Southern California who has applied for admission to the Harvard College Class of 2021—publicly revealed his identity. The other student, a high school sophomore also from Southern California, goes by the initials “M.A.” in court documents and intends to apply to Harvard in the future.
Since filing to join the lawsuit, Fong, who is Asian American, has been deluged with media attention, receiving coverage from major outlets like NBC News and BuzzFeed. But Fong says he has not let his newfound fame “impact my day-to-day life.”
“Sometimes I’ve been the target of some online trolls or people being kind of rude in the comments section but other than that, there hasn’t been a real change,” Fong says.
Fong adds he is speaking out against Blum’s lawsuit in part to combat what he calls popular “misconceptions” about Asian Americans in the United States.
“Asian Americans are kind off rammed off and being used as a wedge group with the affirmative action debate, as a kind of model minority,” Fong says. “I think the general media presents the overall opinion of Asian Americans towards affirmative action as negative, and statistically, that’s not actually true.”
Recent data supports Fong’s claim; a 2016 national poll of Asian American voters conducted in part by legal and civil rights organization Asian Americans Advancing Justice found that a majority of respondents—64 percent—believed affirmative action was a “good thing,” while 25 percent reported viewing the policy as a “bad thing.”
Fong says he first became inspired to get involved in “Asian American politics” in middle school, when he was sitting in a United States history class and noticed there was “nobody who looked like me” in his class textbook. He says he was puzzled by the absence.
Fong soon noticed a pattern: Asian Americans were largely ignored in history books and in popular culture, unless they could be used to drive political agendas, like the anti-affirmative action debate. By serving as a “friend of the court” in Blum’s lawsuit, Fong says he is doing his part to end this narrative.
But he emphasizes there are other, broader reasons to join the suit. Fong says he believes a diverse student body “benefits truly everyone” attending college, and adds he feels duty-bound to speak in support of Harvard’s attempts to foster diversity on campus.
Cregor, the lawyer helping to defend Harvard’s race-conscious admissions, also says he thinks the stakes of Blum’s case are high.
“This lawsuit is the first real test of a race-conscious admissions policy at a private university such as Harvard,” he says. “So we hope this case sends a resounding message that, just as Harvard first argued in Bakke, our universities are allowed to use race-conscious admissions programs to support diversity.”
“We want to make it clear, once and for all, that Mr. Blum’s claims have no legs to stand on,” Cregor adds.
If recent history is any guide, it seems unlikely Blum’s lawsuit will settle the question of race-conscious admissions “once and for all”—at Harvard, or anywhere else. Polarizing since its birth, the policy of affirmative action has continued to generate controversy as it enters the 21st century.
And the result of Blum’s lawsuit is far from certain.
In 2021, the year Fong will graduate from college, affirmative action—as implemented at Harvard—will be 50 years old. Though hopeful, Cregor says trying to predict the status of Blum’s lawsuit at that point would be like “asking a meteorologist to predict the weather ten days out.” No one knows.
In the meantime, the suit wends its slow way through the courts—and Fong, like thousands of other high school students around the world, waits to hear whether he has gotten into Harvard.

Former Secretary of State John Kerry will deliver the Kennedy School’s graduation address on May 24, according to a press release from the school.
Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf wrote in a statement that he is “delighted” that Kerry will speak to the Kennedy School’s Class of 2017.
“John Kerry is a remarkable public servant who has dedicated decades working for peace, security, humanitarian and social justice, and the fight against human-caused climate change,” Elmendorf wrote.
Kerry most recently served as Former President Barack Obama’s Secretary of State from 2013 to 2017. He graduated from Yale University in 1966, and ran an unsuccessful presidential bid in 2004.
Starting in 2017-2018 academic year, Kerry will return to Yale to host the "Kerry Initiative," which will conduct research on global issues like extremist terrorism and climate change. He will also publish a memoir in coming months about his presidential campaign and experiences in public service.
Kerry previously visited Harvard in May 2016 at a launch event for an initiative between the Harvard Global Health Institute and the Harvard University Center for the Environment studying public health and climate change.
The Kennedy School’s previous graduation speakers include former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and David Milibrand, CEO of the International Rescue Committee.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Department of Music will adopt a new undergraduate curriculum beginning in fall 2017, decreasing the number of courses concentrators must take and making more courses eligible for concentration credit.
The roughly 30 current concentrators in the department will be able to choose between fulfilling the current curriculum or requesting the new one.
The new curriculum, approved by the Educational Policy Committee Monday, involves two major changes. First, instead of 13 courses, concentrators will only need to take 10 courses for to graduate. Second, the new curriculum introduces two new concentration tutorials—Music 97a: “Thinking about Music” and Music 97b: “Critical Listening,” as well as the advanced tutorial Music 98, in which students will either prepare to write a thesis or work on a junior project such as a performance or composition.
“We’re very excited about it because it plays on the department’s strengths while still expanding into areas that are important to us. Flexibility is an important concept in the curriculum,” Music professor Anne C. Shreffler said.
Under the current requirements, students enter Music concentration through two introductory theory classes. The new curriculum eliminates the theory requirement and permits students to count certain freshman seminars and General Educations courses towards concentration requirements.
Several Music concentrators, like Dalen L. Ferreira ’19, praised the new curriculum.
“I think it’s a great change. It dramatically changed my plan for the next four semesters and it’s made it a lot easier for me to take classes I’m interested in,” Ferreira said.
While students pursuing a joint concentration in Music and another field still have to take eight Music courses, Isabel M. Lapuerta ’19—a joint Anthropology and Music concentrator—said the elimination of the theory requirement has given her “much more flexibility” in her schedule.
Jake Tilton ’19 agreed. “This new curriculum is a godsend for people like me who love music, but have found their niche outside of traditionally academic subfields within music,” he said.
But, Tilton said, the elimination of most specific course requirements marks a significant shift in the way Harvard teaches music.
“This new curriculum is a really radical departure from Harvard’s previous very strict, defined, and academic curriculum, which was based heavily in theory and musicology,” Tilton said. “This new curriculum, theoretically, allows students to escape filling holes in their musical knowledge that a conservatory environment would certainly fill.”
Shreffler said the new curriculum would not be less rigorous, but would allow students to better tailor their courses to their interests.
“If in an advising meeting, a student expresses that they have a specific goal—graduate school, or Juilliard—then we would advise students to take the courses that they need to pursue that goal. It’s just that not everybody will have to go on the same path.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After some House Faculty Deans shared skepticism over a proposal to replace Harvard’s current housing model, College administrators have decided to put the idea on hold.
In a Feb. 22 meeting, Faculty Deans weighed in on a potential shift towards a housing model more similar to Yale’s, in which first-year entryways would be affiliated with an upperclassman House instead of small “blocking” groups of up to eight students.
The proposed switch had previously been endorsed by the residential subcommittee of a College working group on inclusion and belonging after consulting with a number of student groups and administrators.
“What we made clear is that after long conversations our preference would be to try this early affiliation,” said Dean of Freshman Thomas A. Dingman ’67, a co-chair of the subcommittee.
House Faculty Deans, however, said they were concerned about whether the upperclassman residences have the capacity to take on rising sophomores, both in terms of programming and space. Several College administrators agreed that the proposal was not ideal, according to Dingman and John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67, Adams House Faculty Dean.
Palfrey, another subcommittee co-chair, said the logistical challenges presented by having to involve freshmen in House life became the most significant barrier to adopting the proposal.
“Unfortunately, the way the freshman dorms are set up, and the way the freshman Yards are set up, there is no mathematical simple way to do this,” Palfrey said. “How do we handle 150 rising sophomores at every event that we do in the Houses?”
The Faculty Deans were not alone in having reservations about the proposal: Many other groups, including Undergraduate Council representatives and freshman proctors, also voiced qualms.
“I can’t tell you there was robust enthusiasm for this change,” Dingman said.
Dingman also said he thought support from Faculty Deans would have been crucial if the proposal were to move forward.
“The Faculty Deans were just another group that was consulted,” Dingman said. “But because they lead each of these Houses, their embrace of this would be critical. And if they thought this was going to detract from what they were doing with their current three classes, I think that’s something we have to take into account.”
In a message to Peer Advising Fellows on March 8, Dingman said Khurana had “acted favorably” on the Faculty Deans’ request to adopt other, shorter-term recommendations.
Namely, he wrote that Faculty Deans will plan more programming to encourage freshmen to attend House events in the spring after they are sorted and to better transition students at the beginning of their sophomore year.
Still, Dingman said Tuesday that he thought this proposal gained more traction than previous versions and that the College may return to the idea in the future.
“This has surfaced about every 10 years,” he said. “I think this time it had more traction. We had anticipated what some of the bumps would be in rolling it out, and I think we were convinced in the end that it was worth trying.”
He added that the College will examine Faculty Deans’ efforts to integrate freshmen going forward “and see if they’re making headway.”
Palfrey also agreed that conversations to change the Housing model, often with Yale's model as a potential alternative, have characterized his time as a Faculty Dean.
“We’ve been thinking about this issue of copying Yale for all the years that I’ve been doing this as a House Master and Faculty Dean,” Palfrey said. “It just never was easy.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Undergraduate Council representatives and Harvard Foundation interns discussed the UC’s plan to create a Q guide for comps at the first meeting of a partnership between the two organizations, according to UC President Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18.
Sachee and UC Vice President Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18 said they intended to bring together student organizations representing minority students during their campaign last fall. The coalition’s first meeting took place March 1, several weeks after the UC voted to form the group with the Harvard Foundation’s Student Advisory Committee.
Sachee said the UC's and Foundation’s collaboration, dubbed an “identity coalition,” discussed the Q guide proposal because she thought undergraduates on the Harvard Foundation would “have had experience” in the comp process.
Dylan R. de Waart ’19, co-chair of the Harvard Foundation’s Student Advisory Committee, said the coalition’s discussion about the centralized guide to evaluate comps was “fruitful.”
“Making a list of which comps are the hardest, would that make things more exclusive rather than inclusive? There was some fruitful discussion about how that would be implemented and what that would look like and what the effects might be,” he said.
The coalition brings together more than 90 groups associated with the Harvard Foundation. While these groups elect to send a representative to the meeting, students who are not part of an affinity group can still speak at the meeting, according to Sachee.
“One part of the meeting, we leave for a student forum, so anyone can sign up and bring an issue to the larger committee,” Sachee said. “If you are very interested in these kind of issues and want to be more closely related to these kind of issues and discussions, you’re more than welcome to come.”
Dr. S. Allen Counter, a neurologist at Harvard Medical School and director of the Harvard Foundation and Associate Dean of Students David R. Friedrich also attended the coalition’s first meeting.
“I think the Harvard Foundation is a brilliant organization to be partnered with in discussing issues of culture, race, and diversity at Harvard,” Sachee said.
Adams House representative Nicholas P. Whitaker ’19 said he hopes these meetings will allow more voices to provide input on UC legislation.
“The monthly meetings are going to be places where we will basically force ourselves to listen to multicultural groups and identity groups and receive their information and give them a chance to speak up specifically on Undergraduate Council legislation,” he said.
Sachee said she intends to discuss freshmen “bridge programs”—a way for first-year minority students to connect during Opening Days—at the next meeting.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency has listed Cambridge an “uncooperative jurisdiction” for refusing to comply with federal requests to detain individuals for possible deportation.
President Donald Trump ordered the creation of the Weekly Declined Detainer Outcome Report in January as part of an executive order on immigration. Its first edition, released Monday, lists approximately 100 cities, towns, counties, and agencies across the nation that choose to be “non-cooperative” with agents from the Department of Homeland Security as they seek to identify and deport undocumented immigrants with criminal records.
Cambridge is listed as one of five uncooperative municipalities in Massachusetts—including neighboring Somerville and Boston—which “will not honor ICE detainer[s]”. The report cites a 2014 City Council resolution that reaffirmed Cambridge’s status as a “sanctuary city”—a label it adopted in 1985—and put limits on the city’s compliance with ICE detainer requests.
Despite Trump’s repeated pledges to more aggressively enforce immigration laws and withdraw funds from “sanctuary cities,” Cambridge has refused to drop the label.
Cambridge lawmakers have not held back criticism of the Trump administration in recent months, point to deep-seated differences between the president’s policies and Cambridge’s values.
Earlier this year, Cambridge Mayor E. Denise Simmons and City Manager Louis A. DePasquale promised to steer clear of what they called Trump’s “misguided and un-American” policies in the annual State of the City address.
Earlier this month, the Cambridge City Council voted unanimously to support calls from the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts for the state to withdraw from a federal customs enforcement training program that looks to tighten immigration enforcement statewide.
While the City of Cambridge has embraced the title of sanctuary city, University President Drew G. Faust has said she will not declare Harvard a “sanctuary campus,” arguing that the label puts undocumented students at further risk.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 22, 2017 at 9:38 a.m.
Right-wing news outlets are lambasting the Harvard Library’s online research guide “Fake News, Misinformation, and Propaganda” for linking to a source that they argue mislabels conservative news and research sources as illegitimate.
The research guide, located on the Harvard Library website, includes a link to another guide titled “Tips for Analyzing News Sites,” published by Merrimack College Assistant Professor Melissa Zimdars. While Harvard's guide links to other resources and includes an infographic, Zimdars’s guide details a list of designated “fake news” sites, the majority of which are conservative-leaning. Conservative sources criticized Zimdars’s list when it was originally published, and its inclusion on Harvard’s guide was a particular point of criticism.
Zimdars's guide lists pages such as the Onion, Breitbart News, the National Review, the Independent Journal Review. the Daily Caller, the Drudge Report, and The Washington Examiner, among others.
Conservative media outlets were quick to criticize the inclusion of Zimdars's guide in Harvard’s online research guide. CNS News called the list “strange and contradictory.”
“The Harvard University library is labeling right-leaning media as ‘fake news’ right along with actual crackpot sites,” reads an article from the New York Post, which referred to the list as “phony.” “So much for academic excellence.”
Kent Haeffner ’18, president of the Harvard Republican Club, said that while he believes the guide was “very appropriate for determining something is a legitimate news source,” the inclusion of Zimdars’s list could alienate conservative students.
“It is more slanted against conservatives,” Haeffner said. “It would be a huge disservice to the Harvard community not to have [conservative] perspectives represented in research or in other things simply because they’re on this list.”
Haeffner said the guide conflated fake news sites such as Infowars, which he described as propagating “unsubstantiated claims with no evidence,” with the National Review, which Haeffner described as “a respected conservative opinion website.” Haeffner said he was disappointed that the list did not include Vox and Salon, sites he views as analogous sites to the National Review.
In an emailed statement, Harvard Library spokesperson Kaitlin Buckley said Harvard is committed to providing unfettered access to knowledge.
“The collection of material in no way signals an endorsement of any individual work, but rather reflects our continuing commitment to curating a wide variety of voices, opinions, research findings, and scholarship for the enrichment of our community,” Buckley said.
Amid the criticism surrounding the Harvard Library research guide, the concept of “fake news” has become a salient topic of discussion both on campus and across the country.
“At one level, this is pretty pedestrian: fake news is fake. It’s trivial to define it, but it’s not always trivial to identify it,” Harvard Kennedy School professor Matthew A. Baum said. “We do need to educate people on how to be sophisticated consumers of information, but it’s not entirely clear whether traditional forms of educating people [such as guides] will be sufficient.”
Last year, Baum hosted a conference at the Shorenstein Center to bring together social scientists, policymakers, and representatives from social media outlets to discuss the spread of misleading news in the media.

UPDATED: March 22, 2017 at 2:10 p.m.
Two students from Harvard Law School’s Immigration and Refugee Clinic argued that the United States was no longer a “safe country” for refugees before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington, D.C. Tuesday.
The hearing centered on Canada and the United States’ shared policy on the exchange of refugees. Following President Donald Trump’s recent executive orders cracking down on immigration, the students argued, Canada should no longer bar refugees who first land in the United States from seeking asylum in Canada—currently a provision of the Safe Third Country Agreement, a refugee exchange treaty.
The human rights commission, which promotes human rights in the Western hemisphere, granted the HIRC’s request to participate in this hearing last week. The HIRC’s team—which included HIRC Assistant Director Sabi Ardalan and Law School students Jin U. Kim and Malene C. Alleyne—centered their statements on the status of the agreement, whose integrity Kim said was imperiled by the executive orders.
“[Canada has] a whole set of review procedures that they follow every once and awhile to make sure that the country that was designated as a safe country is still a safe country,” Kim said. “By focusing on the impact of the executive orders, we were arguing that...if Canada actually does the review process again, then the US should not be designated as a safe country of asylum.’”
The HIRC’s appearance before the commission is the clinic’s most recent action against Trump’s immigration orders. The clinic also recently launched the Immigration Response Initiative to provide a range of resources for those impacted by changed immigration and refugee policies under the Trump administration, and has filed a series of amicus briefs in court cases challenging Trump’s immigration orders.
Alleyne, who worked for the commission before beginning her studies at the Law School, said she had an understanding of how to file the paperwork to request a hearing and how to present information effectively to the commission.
“The work involved understanding the procedures, understanding what the hearings mechanism would do, and how the commission could help, and understanding what our ask was,” Alleyne said. “We asked the commission to conduct onsite visits at the US-Canada border to encourage Canada to suspend the agreement and to call a hearing on the Safe Third Country Agreement, but invite Canada to participate because this hearing was with the United States.”
Kim said though the hearing focused on federal United States policies, the government did not send a representative as he said has been the practice for the past 20 years.
“The past administrations have expressed full support of the work that the Inter-American Commision on Human Rights does. The US has always sent representatives, even under the Bush Administration,” Kim said. “I was very disappointed in my own government that in a way they were kind of acting like a stubborn toddler that they really did not want to engage in a constructive dialogue with our colleagues in the Americas.”
Alleyne said the commission has a variety of options for how to address the matters discussed at the hearing, including the site visits the Law School team recommended.
“There are many things the commission could do,” Alleyne said. “The question is what impact it would have on an administration like the Trump Administration.”

UPDATED: March 22, 2017 at 4:02 a.m. 
Divest Harvard plans to occupy Massachusetts Hall sometime next week in protest of the University's decision not to divest from the coal industry.
Members of the activist group, which protests Harvard’s investment in the fossil fuel industry, had originally intended the blockade for Wednesday, though the group cancelled the demonstration after The Crimson learned of the plans. Divest Harvard has postponed the blockade of Massachusetts Hall, which houses the offices of University President Drew G. Faust and other top University administrators, until next week, according to an email sent over the group's email list.
Until early Wednesday morning, the group had planned to blockade the building on Wednesday.
“Tomorrow, members of Divest are going to be blockading Massachusetts Hall from 6 a.m. until the end of the workday,” Isa C. Flores-Jones ’19, a member of the group, said in an interview Tuesday night. “We intend to disrupt the regular workday at Massachusetts Hall to call out President Drew Gilpin Faust as well as the administration for their inaction on divestment.”
Divest Harvard has obstructed administrative buildings several times in the past. Last April, police arrested four protesters demonstrating at the Harvard Management Company headquarters in Boston. In 2015, Divest Harvard blockaded Massachusetts Hall for a week in protest of Harvard’s fossil fuel investments.
“We are prepared for the possibility of arrest,” Flores-Jones said.
According to a press release circulated to Divest members on Tuesday, the planned demonstration marks “a new push for coal divestment.” While Harvard does not currently invest in coal for financial reasons, it has not ruled out re-investing in the future. In the past, Divest Harvard has called on the University to remove its investments in all fossil fuel companies.
Faust has repeatedly stated that Harvard will not divest from fossil fuels, arguing that Harvard can help fight climate change through its research and that divestment would politicize Harvard’s investment practices. She has also argued that such a move could damage the endowment, which lost nearly $2 billion in value in fiscal year 2016.
“While I share their belief in the importance of addressing climate change, I do not believe, nor do my colleagues on the Corporation, that university divestment from the fossil fuel industry is warranted or wise,” Faust wrote in a letter to Harvard affiliates in 2013.
The group has called on HMC to engage in “sustainable investing” in the past. Flores-Jones said organizers planned the blockade at Massachusetts Hall as opposed to the HMC office because it is a “central site for administrative action” and “targets the key decision makers.”
A Massachusetts Appeals Court recently ruled that Harvard is not required to divest from fossil fuels following a lawsuit by student activists.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Another meet, another record for sophomore sprinter Gabby Thomasonly this time she set it on the national stage.
Thomas was one of four members of the Harvard track and field team to travel to Texas A&M for the NCAA Indoor Track and Field Championships on March 10th and 11th. Also competing in other events were freshman pentathlete Judy Pendergast, freshman distance runner Zoe Hughes, and senior thrower Nikki Okwelogu. Though all four athletes put in strong performances at the championships, it was the sophomore alone who had a historic showing.
Finishing with the seventh-fastest time in the semifinals, Thomas became the first woman from the Ivy League to ever advance to the 200-meter dash final at indoor NCAAs.
In the championship race, the Florence, Mass. native crossed the finish line with a time of 23.35 to place eighth overall in the event. In recognition of her efforts, Thomas earned first-team All-America status. Hughes and Okwelogu also finished the meet as All-Americans, making Okwelogu the first three-time recipient in program history.
Thomas capped off an incredible run to the most prestigious collegiate indoor meet with a preliminary time of 22.88 at the Ivy League Heptagonal Championships in the same event. The time was the seventh-fastest in the country, automatically qualifying her for the NCAAs and making her the sixth seed overall. Thomas’ qualifying mark also won her a second consecutive 200-meter dash title and was a new indoor school and Ivy League record.
The sprinter’s momentum from Heps carried over to NCAAs, as Thomas made history during the semifinal round of the 200-meter dash. Yet, through all of her success and her record-breaking season, Thomas has remained humble and is simply happy to have competed at the national championships and to be able to continue pushing herself every race.
“Going into the NCAAs, I was mostly grateful to be there and mostly looking forward to running among the best in the country to be able to challenge myself physically and mentally,” Thomas said. “What motivates me every day is to know that at the other side of hard work and dedication are results. Knowing that it’ll pay off and the feeling when I accomplish that goal, whether it be nationals or breaking 23 seconds indoor.”
Her determination and motivation to always push herself just a little bit harder were clearly demonstrated in her semifinal race at NCAAs. Sprinting across the line in a time of 22:89, only .01 seconds away from her personal indoor record, she finished second in her heat and advanced to the coveted finals for the first time in Ivy League history.
“She’s an amazing athlete, and her best qualities really showed at the finals,” Pendergast said. “I would describe Gabby as focused but relaxed. She knows exactly what she wants to do, but she’s never nervous about achieving that goal.”
On the final day, Thomas could not match her speed from prelims. The Florence, Mass. native clocked in at 23:35 to place fourth in her heat and eighth overall. Oregon sophomore Ariana Washington, who was a 2016 Olympian for the United States, won the event with a time of 22.42.
At the conclusion of the meet, Thomas received first-team All-America status for the second time in her Harvard career and the first time for her indoor efforts.
“Gabby is an amazing teammate,” Pendergast said. “She’s always willing to make you laugh, and always has fun, no matter what the results are of a race, she’s just so happy to be there doing what she does.”
For her teammates, the record-breaking sprinter is more than just a teammate: she’s a close friend and an inspiration to push themselves.
“Gabby is an inspirational teammate because she always gives it her all and pushes herself and all of us to do more than we thought we could,” Hughes said. “Seeing her do so well at the finals was great, and we’re all really proud of her.”
Despite not winning the national title, the sophomore sprinter was very happy with her indoor season this year, and is ready to transfer her indoor success and energy outdoors for the remainder of the track and field season.
“I was happy with the PRs I made and being able to compete at such a high level throughout the season,” Thomas said. “It’s exciting seeing really good competition such as Oregon. I’m looking forward to outdoor because it’s my favorite and seeing how far I go at Nationals.”

After being overwhelmed by its cross-town rival’s potent offense, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team continued its recent slide.
The Crimson (4-3, 0-1 Ivy League) suffered its third-straight loss at the hands of No. 19 Boston University (7-1, 2-1 Patriot League) Tuesday evening at Nickerson Field in Boston, Massachusetts. The squad made the short trip down Storrow Drive to face the Terriers, who are off to their best start in program history.
“I think we gave a good effort, but we were outplayed overall,” head coach Chris Wojcik said. “I thought BU made more plays in almost all areas of the game, and credit them—they played a good game, and they were the better team tonight.”
One area in which Harvard excels is early offensive production. The Crimson has scored first in all but one game this season. Tuesday was no different, as junior midfielder Carney Mahon scored his sixth goal of the season 1:33 into play to put Harvard up 1-0. The Garden City, N.Y. native notched another goal with 6:29 remaining in the fourth quarter to add to his tally.
BU quickly responded with three unanswered goals to end the first quarter leading 3-1. The Terriers connected on four more shots in the second frame to leave Harvard trailing 7-4 at the half.
Harvard’s faceoff inefficiency has taken a toll on the Crimson’s chances at success over the past three games. Harvard has been outpaced at the X in six of seven games this year. The Crimson won the faceoff battle, 16-10, in its season opener at UMass Lowell, while Harvard won just 7 of 25 against the Terriers, dropping the team’s percentage to 39.8 on the season. The squad ranked 56th nationally in faceoff win percentage in the most recent statistical release.
“We haven’t been executing there,” Wojcik said. “We’ll continue to work hard, and make adjustments. James [Sullivan] is our primary faceoff guy, along with a number of other guys, but I think a big part of it was the wings. We created a lot of 50/50s, but we didn’t get the ground balls. That was a big part of the game—a disappointing part of the game—but we’re going to continue what we’re doing everyday to try to get better at the X.”
Harvard’s troubles in the middle third of the field were a catalyst for BU’s 45 shots. By contrast Harvard could only muster 21. The Terriers also scooped up 13 more ground balls than the Crimson.
“We haven’t been playing up to our potential, and we haven’t been playing as well as we would like to the past few games, so I think we just need to get back to the basics,” junior goalie Robert Shaw said. “What makes us a good team is our good attitude, so hopefully we’ll be able to do that over the next couple of days.”
Junior attacker J.T. Palladino continued his run of strong play for the campaign, scoring his fourth and fifth goals of the season over a 6:46 span early in the second quarter—his only two shots of the game. His classmate, attacker Morgan Cheek, who ranks third in the nation in goals per game, was limited to a goal and an assist.
The ever-consistent junior midfielder Joe Lang scored his ninth goal of the season with 5:11 to play in the first half, and has now tallied at least one point in 24 straight contests. This mark is just one shy of Cheek, who extended his streak to 25.
The Crimson has been faring much better on the defensive side. The team’s back line, which allows the third-least goals in the Ivy League, played another solid game, but could not overcome the Terriers’ shooting barrage. Harvard’s netminder, Shaw, ranks 10th in the nation with 12.56 saves per game. Among keepers that play at least 60 percent of their team’s minutes, Shaw’s 0.553 save percentage lands him at second in the Ancient Eight and 13th in the country. The Roxbury Latin product saw 27 shots on goal, and made 14 saves against BU.
After Terriers junior attacker Jack Wilson was penalized for a cross-check, freshman attacker Connor McCroskey capitalized on the extra-man opportunity, scoring his second goal of the season with 8:11 to play in the third quarter. McCroskey’s goal left the Crimson trailing 6-7, but from there the Terriers’ senior attacker Cal Dearth overwhelmed Harvard’s defense en route to tying a BU program record with 7 points, leading the Terriers to victory.
“Tonight was illuminating in terms of where we need to learn, and what we need to do better,” Wojcik said. “So we’ll watch the film together as a team tomorrow, we’ll practice, and basically be working on better execution in each area of the field. We take it one day at a time, and we’ll be back tomorrow just trying to make progress.”

While their teammates had finished the season weeks ago, junior diver Jing Leung and freshman freestyler Miki Dahlke kept training in preparation for NCAA championships, where they competed as the lone Harvard and Ivy League representatives.
The rookie swam in three freestyle events, competing in formidable fields which included Olympic champions Simone Manuel, Abbey Weitzeil, and Katie Ledecky. The California native found herself in rough waters in the 50 free, where she came in 51st of 53 women in 22.99 seconds.
However, the 100 free proved a more contentious race. The finishers in places 34 through 38 were separated by 0.05 seconds, and Dahlke touched the wall in a dead tie with Boise State senior Brittany Aoyama. The duo shared 36th, and Dahlke posted a personal best of 48.78.
The freshman’s highest place came in the 200 free, where she finished 31st in a pool of 54. Her time of 1:48.98 missed a top-30 spot by 0.01 seconds.
On the platform, junior Leung came in 32nd in a field of 45, and her score of 221.50 missed the top 30 by less than a point. The veteran has competed in three straight NCAA championships. In 2016, she made it to the A finals, coming in eighth overall, while she finished 26th her freshman year.
The duo represented the Crimson in a field dominated by Pac-12 and SEC schools. While powerhouse Stanford took the team gold, Harvard’s showing both in the water and on the boards raised a new standard for Ivy League swimmers on the national stage.

Crimson photographers captured some of the highlights of South by Southwest, which took place March 10-19, 2017. South by Southwest, colloquially abbreviated as SXSW, is an annual conference that takes place in Austin, Texas. Thousands of people gather in the city known around the country for its live music, Tex-Mex food, and quirkiness to participate in the conference's events.
This includes a music festival with over 2000 acts performing in clubs, bars, and other venues throughout the city; a film festival highlighting everything from student films to world premieres of big budget movies; and panels featuring industry professionals from technology startups to video gamers.
2017 marks the 30th year SXSW has been held.
Rapper Rick Ross hosts the 2017 "MTV Woodies" award show, held annually at SXSW. The "MTV Woodies" feature emerging artists, which this year included D.R.A.M, Lil Yachty, and MUNA, among others.


Lil Yachty, who features in "Broccoli" alongside D.R.A.M, performs with his crew. 




Desiigner, of "Panda" fame, fires up an ecstatic crowd with his newest single.




The Chainsmokers, in the background of a Rick Ross sign, on stage to accept their "Woodie of the Year" award. They performed separately at Apple Music the night before, and at a Sony-affiliated venue the same night.


Lizzo performs at the Mazda Studio. Performers at SXSW cover a wide variety of experience levels; some are big-name artists and others are up-and-coming. Many of them make a splash at lineups curated by company-sponsored venues, featuring names like "Pandora House" or "Apple Music Space". 


Speaking of Chainsmokers, ROZES performs at SXSW at The Sidewinder Inside on Thursday night. ROZES, stage name for Elizabeth Mencel, saw her music career take off in 2015 with the release of her song "Roses" with The Chainsmokers.

 LA-based FRENSHIP performs hit single "Capsize" at Pandora House.


An audience member records video during FRENSHIP's show at The Bungalow during SXSW. According to the SXSW marketing web page, 72,000 registrants and artists attend the festival.

MUNA performed at Bar 96 on Friday night. MUNA is one of the up-and-coming music groups featured at SXSW, with a little over 10,000 followers on each of their social media sites.

Aminé performs at Vevo House on Wednesday night. The rapper of "Caroline" features an impressive range in his live performance, and more material is set to drop in the coming months.


Whethan performs at Old Antone's on Friday night.
From the photographer: From his remix of Yale-based band Opia to his original tracks, Whethan is probably one of the most anticipated up-and-coming artists that I’ve been following up till SXSW. His production range is particularly promising: centered more or less around trappy, pulsating beats, it spans from the light, melodic Can’t Hide to the heavier remix of Mssingno’s XE3. At the young age of 17, he will be touring with The Chainsmokers in the upcoming months. It’s anyone’s guess whether he will end up sounding more like Louis the Child or Adventure Club. 

A R I Z O N A performs at Pandora House.
From the photographer: For all the electro-pop vibes that show through in tracks like Cross My Mind or Oceans Away, the live version of A R I Z O N A sounded surprisingly real. (The same could arguably be said for FRENSHIP.) I found the stage presence of the entire crew particularly satisfying for a first-time SXSW band. As for the music, it was more than enough to justify their opening spot for Pandora House on Monday: smooth synths roll on in the background, while voices emerge when they are called for.


A crowd envelops a Pell performance at a rooftop concert hosted by Facebook.

SXSW isn't just for musicians, though. In his first major appearance since his White House days, former Vice President Joe Biden spoke to a crowded SXSW auditorium about his personal initiative to end cancer. His speech comes just a year after then-President Barack Obama made an appearance at 2016's iteration of SXSW.
It was a bittersweet appearance. Biden previously made an appearance at Harvard's Institute of Politics a few years ago, and at SXSW, he is visibly older. He speaks at a slower cadence. The events he's gone through in the past year have taken a toll on him, and the heaviness of it all permeates through the speech. But he’s made a fundamental decision in backing this initiative. He tries to convince the crowd to do the same.
