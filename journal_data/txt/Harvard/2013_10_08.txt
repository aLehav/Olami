Margaret Atwood's newest novel, “MaddAddam,” brings to a close the apocalyptic science fiction trilogy that began with “Oryx and Crake” and “The Year of the Flood.” The first two novels tell the story of the “waterless flood,” a plague designed by the genius Crake to eliminate the human race, ending its rampant destruction of the natural world. In its place, Crake creates a new species, genetically engineered to eliminate every feature he believes contributed to the current sad state of humanity. But the plague wasn’t perfectly effective—a few survivors remain. Jimmy, Crake’s boyhood friend, becomes a prophet figure for the “Crakers,” as he calls the new human species, telling them stories of their creator. Ren, Amanda, Toby, Zeb, and other members of the God's Gardeners, an eco-spiritualist cult that emerged in the slums of the pre-flood world, also survive, joining with a few of Crake’s former collaborators to attempt to build a life after the flood. Other survivors, including some hardened criminals, add to the dangers of the now unfamiliar world.
“MaddAddam” picks up where “Oryx and Crake” and “The Year of the Flood” left readers dangling: Toby and Ren have just discovered Jimmy, injured and hallucinating, and rescued Amanda from the men who kidnapped and repeatedly raped her. Toby ruminates on her memory of that night, cursing herself for allowing the criminals to escape. This provides the framework for the novel’s present-timeline plot—we get a climactic fight scene, the confrontation one expects in the anarchy of a post apocalyptic world. But, as with the preceding novels, most of the story occurs in the past. This time it's the story of Zeb, the smart-mouthed, ever-capable “bad boy” who we remember from “The Year of the Flood,” and with whom Toby, our narrator, is in love. In typical fashion for this trilogy, it turns out we remember him, albeit under different names, from a few other places as well, and the past lives of Atwood's characters become, if possible, even more entangled.
While the previous books each ended after resolving the majority of their plot questions, the closing scenes brought chance encounters that left the characters' futures open to wild speculation. Atwood is an author of such talent that readers might have hungered for more even without these cliffhanger endings. “MaddAddam” delivers, although not as spectacularly as one could have hoped. Fans of “Oryx and Crake” and “The Year of the Flood” will revel in the return to their world, but there may be little to interest anyone else.
Atwood's extraordinary skill as a writer is still evident, but there is something missing from her creative prose. Her use of language is both clever and beautiful, and her characters and their interactions are decisively believable. There are also plenty of displays of the unique, dark humor that helped make the preceding novels so engaging. For instance, the Crakers, upon hearing Jimmy exclaim “Oh, fuck!” come to believe that “Fuck” is an invisible helper, a friend of their creator-figure Crake. Yet “MaddAddam” doesn't afford quite the same opportunity for the spectacular, detailed world building of the previous two books. “Oryx and Crake” explored a world of all-powerful corporations and genetic engineering run rampant, endowing humanity with the power to create both wonders and nightmares. “The Year of the Flood” explored the impoverished underside of this world—street fights, high-tech strip clubs, criminals punished through the death-match sport of “Painball,” as well as the theology and customs of the God's Gardeners. In “MaddAddam,” this rich world has already been rendered in stunning detail; the most we get is some shading in around the edges.
The plot is similarly lacking in freshness. “MaddAddam” appears to exist not by dint of its own driving force, but rather to tie up some loose ends from its predecessors. Zeb is an intriguing character in his own right, and Atwood develops a back-story for him that is simultaneously fascinating and heart-wrenching. Unfortunately, this story never feels quite complete. Perhaps it lacks the pleasing symmetry of a tale told for its own sake, as it functions simply as a medium to deliver answers about the founding of the God's Gardeners as well as MaddAddam, the novel’s eponymous bio-terrorist organization. As a protagonist, Zeb is too vulgar and too ready to kill,  traits which make him beguiling at first, but ultimately create discomfort on the part of the reader that Atwood fails to turn to any particular purpose.
Several other factors contribute to the less than inspiring result. Toby fails to bring much to the table as narrator. Her internal conflicts emerge primarily from jealousy—an emotion that tends to be more irksome than sympathy-inducing.  She, like many of the characters, appears used up by her experiences fighting to survive after most of humanity is wiped out. Throughout “MaddAddam,” energy is in short supply. The plague has come and life as we know it has vanished, but we are already done with the interesting part, for “Oryx and Crake” and “The Year of the Flood” covered all bases explaining why the catastrophe occurred. The original shock and awe, with every aspect of life a struggle, is gone, and the everyday work of building a new life—gardening, cooking, gleaning supplies, fortifying the fence—is fairly boring. Several hundred pages where nothing of much interest, apart from reminiscence, occurs are capped off with some hurried action in the novel's latter third, bringing the book to an abrupt ending.
Despite these complaints, there is plenty to praise in MaddAddam—the detail, the characters, the sardonic wit, the poignant questions about life after civilization, the parallels to traditional origin stories. In fact, it is only when compared to these strengths, which set a high standard for the book, that the flaws stand out. For Atwood’s established readers, “MaddAddam” provides the excitement of returning to the world she so vividly created in “Oryx and Crake” and “The Year of the Flood,” as well as a sense of closure previously absent. But the new novel pales in comparison to its predecessors, leaving us to wonder if perhaps the trilogy would have best been left a duology. Not every blank space needs filling in.

Anyone who was alive on November 22, 1963 knows where they were when John F. Kennedy was shot, a day that changed America forever. Writer and director Peter Landesman’s “Parkland,” based on “Four Days in November: The Assassination of President John F. Kennedy” by Vincent Bugliosi, tries to tell that story through the eyes of a few bystanders who were directly affected by Kennedy’s death in unexpected ways. Unfortunately, the film packs too much in during its relatively short run time to be very coherent or satisfying, despite its deeply compelling subject matter.
Most moviegoers will likely rush to praise Paul Giamatti’s portrayal of Abraham Zapruder, the man behind the Zapruder film. Vital to all conspiracy theories behind the assassination, the Zapruder film is a 26-second reel that captured, in eerie, full-color detail, the murder of John F. Kennedy. Few people think about the man behind the camera, and fewer still probably imagine him as someone whose life was ruined by his camera. Landesman makes the choice never to show the Zapruder film in full—instead we see reactions of others seeing the film for the first time, a compelling tactic that, like many of the film’s almost great moments, descends into melodrama. As the Secret Service pushes Zapruder to develop his film and journalists scramble to get the reel, Giamatti sometimes shows Zapruder’s inner turmoil a little too outwardly. Upon showing the film to Secret Service agents and journalists, he shakes and shudders and eventually shouts, overpowering what could have been a moment of stylistic restraint as Landesman shows the film reflected in Zapruder’s glasses.
Melodrama is also the kiss of death for the most gut-wrenching of the stories—that of Robert Oswald (James Badge Dale), Lee Harvey Oswald’s brother, as well as the rest of the Oswald family. The Oscar-winning Jacki Weaver deserves better than she’s given in the role of Lee and Robert’s paranoid mother. Dressed up in cat’s-eye glasses and huge furs, she uses a theatrical Texan accent to explain that her son was working for the government and being framed. She’s a petulant and sour character with little depth, and she seems out of place amid an otherwise complex storyline. Dale, on the other hand, grants endless layers to the role of the pained and confused brother of an assassin. As a stoic man caught in a deluded family, he draws sympathy from the audience as he pleads with his incarcerated brother for information and with his mother for peace. Robert Oswald, apparently, never doubted his brother had killed the President, never knew why, and never left Texas. However, that’s the story you want to be watching, the one after the “Four Days in November,” when Robert Oswald, his children, and his nieces have to carry on the family name. Unfortunately, Landesman only gives Dale two large scenes of note and fails to expand further on his story.
By far the worst of the narratives is, tragically, the one that takes place at Parkland Memorial Hospital. Melodramatic, poorly acted, poorly cast and more or less unnecessary, the scenes seem mostly present for some gruesome shock factor. Landesman pours a truly gratuitous amount of blood over every actor that enters the hospital. Jackie Kennedy (Kat Steffens) walks into the operating room weeping, hands “brain matter” over to the nurse, and then cowers in the corner staring at her husband’s bloody body. Perhaps the oddest part of the hospital scenes, however, is the inexplicable presence of the all-American Zac Efron. Judging by the promotional materials, Efron was expected to draw a crowd, but his scenes are few and far between, and when he is on screen, he stands out for being too “Hollywood” in a movie focused on everyday people. Unfortunately, Efron is a long way from being ready to play the schlubby, understated young Texas doctor on call when both Kennedys arrive at the hospital, and each overlong close-up of his face makes his entire storyline seem forced.
The film does have shining moments—real news footage used throughout goes hand in hand with the perfectly periodized costumes and sets, all of which immediately make viewers feel transported to the fateful day. A few scenes of the Secret Service in mourning are also particularly affecting—some immediately aligned themselves with Johnson (Sean McGraw), others tear apart the interior of Air Force One to make room for JFK’s coffin—especially when juxtaposed against the painfully small ways the Oswalds are permitted to mourn (with no willing pallbearers, Robert Oswald has to implore the journalists covering his brother’s funeral to carry the coffin).
In the end, the most maddening thing about “Parkland” is the thought of how good it could have been. There’s certainly no shortage of acting talent or plot to go around, but Landesman, a newbie to the film world, takes on too much in his directorial debut, and the potential glimpsed throughout the film gets lost in the shuffle.

Interstate thirty-five doing eighty in an Audi A6, alright? You’re zipping north from San Antonio with a Dr. Pepper, tater tots, and instructions to keep the car immaculate. Sister is driving and you fidget shotgun. Together you giggle at a billboard prophesying the 2027 Apocalypse but for the most part it’s a dull dead shot to downtown Dallas. A periodic highway sign reads, “2214 Deaths on Texas Roads This Year.” You think: since January, how often is that? Do most of them occur on weekends? Will the number rise before we hit land? Two thousand two hundred and fourteen. Two two one four. Twenty two. Fourteen.  
 
But right now you’re concerned with finding an iPod auxiliary port because that “Graceland” CD can only get so much mileage. It must be here somewhere; don’t tell me I have to hook up Bluetooth! Well maybe this button does—no, that opens the glove compartment. How about this—no, now my seat is reclining. You wonder if another one will eject you through the sunroof or sprout wings from the passenger doors. This 400-page owner’s manual is no help. But here’s another button—an inconspicuous bubble on the center panel by the cupholders. It says “P.” P for “Push Me!” So you push. And your speed drops in half. And an object in motion tends to stay in motion. And you don’t understand what’s happening and your car flips. And the tally rises: Fifteen. Sixteen.
 
Fortunately the parking brake was as easy to release as it was to engage: the alternate tragedy stays backstage. You press forward, baffled and insecure. “David let’s you not touch anything else in the car, OK?” Between the water towers of Waxahachie and Waco, I recover my nerves and become newly enraged. The parking brake should not be a subtle device! Its operation should be deliberately mechanical. But this is the way of so much else in the modern automobile—you flip a switch to lower the window or push an oversized button to start the engine. Google is experimenting now with a driverless car and the U.S. is making waves with its UAVs. The adrenaline subsides and my heart resumes its regular subdued rhythm on the road toward dusty Denton. The passing billboard for a jeweler pairs a diamond ring with the text: “Update her status.” 
 
“These are the days of miracle and wonder,” so says Paul Simon. We have more than 7 billion people on earth and all the less space for each individual to strut and fret his hour. Here now are marvelous innovations and new extraordinary ways of failing; with cash I had to account for every bill, but with credit I can sign, swipe, and sprint to inconceivable debts. Our world is circumscribed in discreet gestures and tiny swipes of the index finger. By twitches of the eye and face, Stephen Hawking continues to articulate our universe. 
During my sophomore spring I sat in the crowded back row of Dunster d-hall to watch an outstanding new student-produced translation of Mozart’s 1786 opera, “Le Nozze Di Figaro.” In the opening scene, we witness Figaro incrementally measuring space for his wedding bed: “Five...Ten...” he counts off with obvious pleasure. In the audience, a videographer struggles to wordlessly explain that he is filming the show, so please do not walk in front of the camera. He finally makes his point clear by pantomiming the cranking of an old-fashioned video camera like Carl Denham filming “King Kong.” I think of other descriptive gestures that refer to obsolete technology: the “pull-down” motion to ask a truck driver to blow his horn, or the “rolling” signal to have someone lower their window. Actions that closely resemble their referent—visual onomotopoeia. Meanwhile the servant protagonist continues: Twenty. Thirty.
 
There is an elemental satisfaction in negotiating the materiality of your world. It gives you a feeling of action and consequence, control and agency. It is perhaps the very reason why I still print my readings at Lamont or play “Guitar Hero” over “Call of Duty” at most opportunities. To quote da Ponte’s libretto—“il chitarrino le suonerò.” Yes! There is likewise a battle between the luxury of doing nothing for yourself—like a 19th century Russian aristocrat from "Anna Karenina" who wears fancy cufflinks and long yellow fingernails—and the respect of doing real “work”: force over distance. That Bob Dylan could betray folk music with his electric guitar. That Skrillex could possibly put on a concert with just a Macbook Pro. We feel cheated when output is disproportionate to input, and in some ways we are.
 
I am no opponent of progress. I am interested in how the past informs the present on the rocky road of development. Our intelligent touchscreen keyboards still use the same QWERTY format that originated with the need to avoid typewriter jams. It’s like when you finally arrive at that wedding in Dallas and admire the post-ceremony line-dancing. Men and women shuffle forward, backwards, side-to-side, a ninety-degree turn and repeat. Heel, toe, dosey do, come on baby let’s go. Here’s the give and take as I see it now in early October. Twenty. Thirteen.

 In her recent open letter to Miley Cyrus, Sinead O’Connor warns of the consequences of letting the music industry “pimp” singers. She claims: “It is absolutely NOT in ANY way an empowerment of yourself or any other young women, for you to send across the message that you are to be valued (even by you) more for your sexual appeal than your obvious talent.”
  Looking at Seoul, it is worth considering how the media and proliferation of K-pop culture has affected the portrayal of women. Some people point to the presence of the nation’s first female president, Park Geun-Hye, and claim women in Seoul are becoming equal to their male counterparts. And a quick walk through the bumping Gangnam, Apgujeong, or Hongdae areas of Seoul on a weekend evening may come as a shock for those who remember a society traditionally rooted in deep Confucian and conservative thought in which women were not vocal and did not show any more skin than necessary. Now, it is unsurprising to see women dressed far more liberally, and some people say that this is a visible sign of empowerment. But does shedding clothing truly imply empowerment? Or does the ability to dress “loudly” simply suggest that women have bought into this freedom of dress as an alternative to true empowerment and equality? Rather, it seems women have allowed the media images and hyper-sexualized portrayals of the “new independent woman” to “pimp” their dignity.
  Historically, the representation of females in K-pop has been problematic. Female artists are often depicted as a hybrid between children and sexually developed adults, such as in the wildly popular song “Gee” by Girls’ Generation. The lyrics repeat phrases such as “어떻게? (What should I do?),” “바보 (fool),” or “몰라 (I don’t know),” essentially infantilizing mature adult women, making them seem like utterly clueless children who must depend on older men to teach them about love. Not only do these portrayals and lyrics subordinate females, they also enforce the idea that it is acceptable for a woman to “dumb herself down” to attract a partner. Moreover, the girls in this video are literally displayed as mannequins in a store window, and at the start of the video, a teenage boy walks around these girls, as if to prove the point that these girls are the objects of male fantasy. K-pop marketing caters to a heterosexual male audience and seemingly suggests that women’s societal role is to feed the male gaze.
  Of course, it can be argued that not all girl groups in the K-pop scene promote the infantilization of women like the song “Gee.”  Rather, nearly every popular girl group often alternates between “cute” and “bold” concepts to keep their fans interested. For instance, consider the more recent release “I Got A Boy” by the same group, Girls’ Generation. At first glance, it seems the girls have grown up from their soft, bubblegum pop image. The girls don edgier clothing and dance to a powerful street dance-infused choreography. At the start of the song, the girls seemingly poke fun at women who change their style to attract men as they sing, “(translated) Ridiculous! [That girl] became pretty and sexy just for that man, right?” However, as the song progresses, the chorus repeats: “(translated) I got a boy, he’s awesome / I got a boy, he’s kind / I got a boy, handsome boy, my heart’s been taken away.” And further along in the song, the girls sing, “(translated) My prince! / When will you rescue me?”
Instead of being a song about poking fun at the desire to gain male approval, “I Got a Boy” quickly devolves into a song about how the girls have “got a boy,” and how things are much better as a result. Regardless of the packaging of the song, one thing remains constant: female K-pop artists orient themselves around men in order to gain attention, whether they sing about their first love, a breakup, getting back at a man who cheated, or finding new love. Songs that attempt to showcase “strong women” often fall back on subordinating women instead.
  However, that isn’t to say that the entire K-pop industry suffocates women. Some female groups have managed to create songs that are refreshing and satirize the industry’s subordination of women. Consider “Sixth Sense” by the Brown-Eyed Girls. Both the song and music video are about the Brown-Eyed Girls’ revolution against male authority. According to the lyricist of the song, Kim Eana, the members themselves represent aspects of revolution. Rapper Miryo symbolizes women’s voice, vocalist Gain symbolizes resistance, vocalist Jea symbolizes sacrifice, and leader Narsha symbolizes the “sixth sense” of women,” perhaps referring to female sexual awareness and freedom. The girls overthrow oppressive power constructs in the video, as they perform strong choreography and unapologetically sport dark make-up and aggressive facial expressions.
  Another group well known for their portrayals of independent women is miss A. In their hit song “Goodbye Baby,” miss A begin auditions to become backup dancers for a famous male celebrity. The man lounges in a chair, eating cherries and rolling dice to decide the fate of the women. Here, the man represents the way the South Korean media consumes women in its stifling portrayal of female gender roles and unattainable ideals of perfection. However, as the song continues, the tables turn. The girls reappropriate male privilege; all of the images of male dominance become symbols of their self-agency and ownership instead. The very chair in which the male celebrity lounged later becomes a throne for the girls.The girls leave no question about their message—their latest hit song was bluntly titled, “I Don’t Need a Man.” 
  Songs such as these suggest that there is a strong understanding of the problematic portrayals of women in media and in the K-pop industry, but for every song or video about female independence there are a plethora of songs that infantilize and subordinate women—for every step of progress, the industry seems to take two steps backward. And that isn’t to say that portrayals of men in K-pop are any healthier. Until consumers—both male and female—of K-pop champion empowered and healthier portrayals of men and women, it seems the industry will continue to produce more media that increasingly reinforce this strict division of stereotypical gender roles.

Every semester, I allow myself one TV addiction. Though often it balloons beyond my allotted one show, that one hour a week is my mandated break from the intensity of (granted, wonderful) Harvard life.
This semester, my hour has gone to Joss Whedon’s “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” an excellent new series that would be worthy of its own column. Though new, “S.H.I.E.L.D.” is part of the larger video universe that Marvel first unveiled on the silver screen in movies like “Iron Man” and “The Avengers.” Though Marvel’s movies have been for the most part monumentally successful, “S.H.I.E.L.D.” marks a new, risky stage in their attempts to branch out from comic books. Multiple tangential movies and a successful tied-in show featuring a complicated mythology is a model only “Star Trek,” a brand known for its quality, longevity, and geekiness, has successfully achieved. Like with evolution of shows such as “Star Trek,” which was built on tangential stories on multiple platforms, Marvel is attempting to diversify the availability and accessibility of its stories. It is no surprise, then, that Marvel is making “S.H.I.E.L.D.” available on channels like Hulu, in order to increase the durability of their brand.
Hulu is an internet TV provider— for free, I can watch a huge number of TV shows and movies, including current series (though these are often delayed). For $7.99 a month, I can watch anything on the site’s vast directory, including current series and vast archives of historical ones, both those of legend and others long-forgotten. What makes the service even more incredible is that I can do all of this from my dorm room, with no special privileges, skills, or connections beyond Harvard WiFi; beyond the fact that many of these shows are still attached to networks, I would never even need to know what ABC was. Hulu has opened up a channel directly from me to the show I’m watching.
Hulu is not alone in its field— Netflix, Amazon Prime and HBOGo have sizeable shares of internet TV watchers, along with a number of other free or subscription-based services and pay-as-you go models. They exist in relative harmony by offering slightly different types of content, but for all intents and purposes exist to serve the same customer.
These companies are all slightly different; though they seem to currently serve similar purposes, their evolutions to this point vary widely—Netflix is the current iteration of the mail-order video service, HBOGo is the web extension of the cable service HBO, Amazon Prime selects content for subscribers from the larger Amazon directory, and Hulu is internet TV, run by media giants Disney, NBC, and Fox. While all have been successful in different ways, Netflix has led the pack in new programming not just of offbeat niche shows (like Hulu), but, most famously, the legendary Bluth clan of “Arrested Development.”
Though “Arrested Development” is  one of the most incredible things to happen in recent TV history, fans of cult TV shows have to accept that cancellation is the end, and if the show comes back, it will be only maybe in some sad, half-attempted version. “Arrested Development,” though, went straight to the internet and was wildly successful, maybe because of it. In addition to its revival of “Arrested Development,” Netflix has begun to produce its own extremely popular shows, like “House of Cards” and “Orange is the New Black,” and Hulu has a stable of news shows it has created, along with a number of international shows never before available in the U.S.
Internet TV has had an effect on what is being produced for TV already, and I predict that trend will only escalate. Viewers can now watch what they want to, on their time. Niche shows can be created, and targeted advertising pays for the cost of these (often lower-cost) series. Additionally, many of these services are providing a film and television education to those who would have had none. 
Now, Marvel can create “S.H.I.E.L.D.,” rife with “easter eggs” to the comic book series and oblique references to the movie, and not worry about a core audience—the core audience, they know, will come. And if someone else clicks “if you watch this other show, you may like…”? Well, Marvel’s even happier. Now, internet… what are we going to do about “Firefly”?

Only about 25 people were lucky enough to get seats for each performance in the Adams Pool Theatre to see the bravura performance by Elizabeth K. Leimkuhler ’15 in “Miss Margarida’s Way,” Brazilian Roberto Athaye’s wrenching one-woman show about authority. The play, written during the height of Brazilian dictatorial repression in the 1970s, stars a high-strung and strict eighth-grade teacher, Miss Margarida, as an exemplar of power. The teacher informs and berates the audience, who stand in as her class, about a number of macrocosmic issues including death, sex, probability, and religion, becoming increasingly manic as she gets closer to dangerous fundamental truths. Universally applicable, the play, buoyed by Leimkuhler’s kinetic honesty in the role, challenges the audience to examine their possible blind adherence to teachers and societal constructs.
The set and presentation of the play claustrophobically reinforced the concept of an intimate classroom. An assistant producer led attendees through the narrow hallways of Adams’ House basement, telling them to use their cell phones “at their own risk” and to find assigned seats in the theater. The four rows of classroom chairs, on the same level as the stage, further suggest a compact and simplistic eighth grade room. Miss Margarida sits behind her desk, hands fidgeting, watching with intensity as her students look for their name cards on the chairs. On stage near Miss Margarida are a blackboard, a skeleton, and as a modern-day update, a Macbook Pro.
After all are seated, the teacher rises and begins to address her students. From the start, Leimkuhler’s intensity and honesty made her impossible to ignore. Hovering just on the brink of sanity, she spoke with impeccable diction and paced across the room, tugging at her perfectly starched skirt and tucked-in button down. Full of almost incomprehensible energy, Margarida presents her concept of school as an inevitability comparable to birth. She writes key words maniacally on the board, her head bobbing up and down with every letter. Even before she begins attacking audience members and becoming caught up in psychosexual manipulation, it is obvious that Miss Margarida is not representative of a disciplinary ideal, but rather the harsh and pervasive archetype of the paranoid pedagogue.
Leimkuhler’s consistent adherence to her complicated character was astounding. A master both of diction and oratory strength, as well as expression and physicality, she presented a portrait of a woman deeply damaged by the intensity of her need to rule her class. Whether yelling explicit sexual come-ons at particular members of the audience or asking her oft-repeated query, “Is there anyone named Messiah in the class?” Leimkuhler’s portrayal was fully formed and without fluctuation. Her ability to navigate the potentially overblown character without becoming a parody of herself or losing any of her initial subtlety was a testament to the strength of her preparedness and devotion to the role. Despite her deplorably narcissistic and often violent attributes, Leimkuhler’s Margarida retained elements of vulnerability, particularly near the end of the show. In those vulnerable moments, she gradually talked herself into an immobilizing rage, making it impossible to discount her humanity completely.
Although Leimkuhler broke the fourth wall throughout the play, her strongest moments came when she communicated directly with her students. In graceful interludes staged by director Joey R. Longstreet ’16, Margarida paced through the aisles between the seats, stopping to leer straight into the eyes of individuals while accusing them of being “queers,” deviants, or drug-users. In a climactic moment seemingly representative of a denial of death, she smashes the class skeleton to bits, arms and legs flying into the audience. Initially silent and passive despite Miss Margarida’s provocations, the audience eventually begins to rebel against their imagined teacher, presumably of their own volition. They are driven by Margarida’s oppression—as citizens of a dictatorial government are likewise driven to rebellion—to write swear words on the board during the fifteen minute “recess,” or raise their hands to ask challenging questions during a hilariously contradictory presentation on the deadly dangers of marijuana.
Contradiction most aptly describes  the content of Miss Margarida’s teachings. She decries sex education while unleashing X-rated erotic tirades, touts the unavoidable nature of school while commenting upon the endless possibilities in life, and repeatedly reminds her pupils of her love of order while her lessons fall further into anarchy. With a lesser actress, these contradictions could have become a bit repetitive and grueling after a while, and perhaps Athaye even intended them to be so. Yet as Leimkuhler became more neurotic and inconsistent in her convictions, her character simultaneously solidified. By the last scene, when Miss Margarida collapses in a fit while trying to verbally summate the universe, her spell is fully cast. Leimkuhler got up off the ground, brushed herself off, and tacitly apologized for her outburst as the bell rang, signaling the end of her character’s descent and a brilliant theatrical exploration.

In Boston University’s “A Musical Journey through Latin America” on Thursday, Argentine pianist Lilia Salsano displayed remarkable technical ability while performing an unconventional presentation of solo piano pieces written by lesser-known Hispanic composers. 
Underwritten by Boston University’s Voces Hispánicas and the Peruvian Ministry of Culture as well as other sponsors, the concert sought to present the work of these composers in celebration of national Hispanic Heritage Month. The mission of the Voces Hispánicas is to strengthen the cross-cultural dialogue between artists from Spain, Latin America, and the United States. While the concert was generally well executed, the set following the intermission was noticeably better performed and appeared to be more in keeping with Salsano’s artistic strengths.
 The first half of the program was made up of the works of composers from Argentina, Peru, Mexico, and Cuba, all of whom primarily worked in the 20th century. Among these were better known artists such as Argentine Astor Piazzolla, famed for his tangos, and more obscure ones such as Ernesto Lecuona, whose charming “Danza Lucumí” was the highlight of the set. Salsano, the sole piano soloist in the concert, exhibited great command of the complicated rhythms that characterize Latin American music and a restraint of expression that is admirable given contemporary trends in the concert piano world, in which many musicians emphasize expressiveness at the expense of musicianship. This restraint, however, occasionally verged into a sense of lifelessness or dullness; for the first half of the show, it seemed at times that Salsano was giving the performance a half-hearted attempt. In spite of these problems of musicality, Salsano’s strong technical skill carried the performance.
The second half of the program featured music composed by Peruvian Marco Antonio Flores-Villanueva, resident composer at Boston University. This section was more interesting in some respects, in that hearing several pieces from a lesser-known composer gives a much better sense of his overall style than one “typical” or “indicative” piece. Flores-Villanueva’s work is distinguished by a very heavy debt to Chopin—the central theme of whose “Heroic Polonaise” sounds suspiciously like the theme of one of Chopin’s nocturnes—and a brightness in sound that was not by and large found in the works of the first half of the program. 
Here, Salsano excelled: by the second piece of the second half, the “Heroic Polonaise,” she was exhibiting a passion that suggested that her true calling as a pianist is to interpret the great piano solo pieces of the late Romantics. At the same time, she maintained a strictness of technique that lesser pianists lose when striving for expressiveness. The second half of the show reached its peak in her performance of Flores-Villanueva’s “Nocturne,” in which her impassioned dynamics did not cause the delicate right-hand melody to be lost in the rich, thunderous harmonies.
Overall, the concert’s refreshing nature was maximized by its choice of pieces and the fact that, unlike many concerts of similar theme, it was not dominated by the one or two Latin composers who happen to have reached a relatively wide audience. It even chose to exclude the work of Spanish-born Isaac Albeníz, choosing to focus rather on lesser-known modern Central and South American composers.
Unfortunately, the closing minutes of the performance were marred by minor technical difficulties, primarily hiss from the left stack of speakers. Given freer rein in oeuvre and better technical support, Salsano would definitely be able to give a performance of exceptional caliber. In spite of its flaws, though, this concert was largely successful in its cultural and artistic goals. As part of Boston University’s art and culture series celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month—which also includes other classical concerts and a panel discussion sponsored by BU’s Department of Romance Studies— it was a great success in giving an attractive presentation to lesser-known Latin American artists and highlighting a musician whose fame has been primarily local to this point.

“Bangerz” is what everyone has been waiting for after the chaos of Miley Cyrus’s recent media blitz. Her now-infamous twerk heard ’round the world caused so much backlash it sprung an anti-backlash movement in the New York Times, of all places. Talk about coming out with a bang(erz).
This is Cyrus’ 10th album, including the six she produced as her childhood alter ego Hannah Montana. Cyrus embraces her new status as a bad girl on the album and flaunts her persona as a sex-kitten gangster, sacrificing lyrics and melodies in favor of cheap and awkward sex-talk.
On “Bangerz,” Cyrus tries so hard to break out of her Hannah Montana persona that she’s all shock and no substance. By now, everyone knows Miley Cyrus is all grown up. Unfortunately, as her new album “Bangerz” shows, growing up doesn’t mean maturing.
“We Can’t Stop,” the first single off “Bangerz,” is probably the best pop anthem on the album. Here, Cyrus finds a balance between her many personalities as a piano deemphasizes the drum machine and Cyrus herself allows a little Hannah Montana simplicity: “La-da-di-da-di / We like to party.” The song feels self-aware in its lack of depth and works where many of the other songs fail. On some of her more overtly sexual songs, that simplicity attempts to pass as sophistication. Cyrus’s most overtly sexual song, “#GETITRIGHT,” sounds like it was written by a 13-year-old trying to mirror R-rated movies (she rhymes “sexy, sexy” with “flexy, flexy”).
After being called out for her hip-hop influence, Cyrus was quoted as saying she wasn’t trying to be the “white Nicki Minaj” or even to rap. Unfortunately, she doesn’t follow that promise on “Bangerz.” “Love Money Party,” one of the songs that relies heavily on Cyrus’ rapping, focuses on the glory and uselessness of those three words and little else. The faux-exotic synths and tinny drums play up her lack of experience and lend the song the same childish feel that derails her attempts at erotica. The song features Big Sean, and he overshadows her in every possible way, leaving you wishing yet again that she was belting and he was rapping on his own.
The catchy songs on the album, too, have painfully simple lyrics. “FU (feat. French Montana)” is a catchy, kiss-off ballad that has a cute enough premise for a pop song, but suffers from shallow lyrics, such as “Only two, two letters for you / One of them’s F and other one is U / SMH I’ll press the send on you”. Lyrics of that caliber are par for the course on “Bangerz.” The beautiful and raw “My Darlin’” which samples “Stand By Me,” is ruined by the chorus of “We gon’ make a movie and it’s gon’ be in 3D, a 3D.”
The tragedy of the album is that Cyrus really can sing. She’s left teasers across the internet of backyard sessions that show off how wonderful her voice can really be (please look up her rendition of “Lonesome When You Go,” as a favor to yourself).Instead of allowing that voice to come through, Cyrus relies on imitating the greats before her. Cyrus is Amy Winehouse at one moment, Nicki Minaj at another, Rihanna in one place; Mariah Carey comes in, as does Ke$ha; she’s even reaching to her Miranda Lambert roots for a track or two. Britney even makes an actual appearance on “SMS (Bangerz).”
One of the most satisfying songs on “Bangerz” is “4x4,” which reaches back to Cyrus’s Nashville roots to excellent results. The song was also the least cluttered by producers and writers and was almost entirely done by Cyrus and Pharrell. In Nelly, a rapper familiar with country, Cyrus finally finds a fitting complement to her vocals.
Considering her new “fearless” image, “Bangerz” is surprisingly guarded. The best songs on the album are the few where Cyrus sings on her own and takes on any kind of emotional range. “Maybe You’re Right,” isn’t about sex or anger or “struttin’ her stuff,” it’s about being called crazy by someone you love and worrying they’re on to something. “Bangerz” needed more of this fearlessness and less of her near-childish need to be seen as more of a sex symbol “artist” than as a promising singer entering a new phase.
As a pop album, “Bangerz” delivers on the basics: a few hit singles, a few club hits, a few ballads. Cyrus will be able to squeeze more success from it if she chooses to. It seems somewhat more likely, though, and somewhat disappointing that Cyrus’s fame will continue to grow for reasons other than her voice.
For the time being, it seems like not much can stop Miley. However, hopefully her next album will focus more on coming into her own instead of trying so hard to seem like a “grown up.”

 "Reflektor"
Arcade Fire, "Reflektor"
They’ve done it again. With their new single “Reflektor,” Arcade Fire tantalizes us with an interestingly rich and complex melody. The lyrics weave together seamlessly, creating a cohesive and haunting imprint. Adding further interest, the band stays true to their Montreal roots by injecting just a hint of Anglo-Franco bilingualism. With its well-executed, ominously cinematic tone, listening to this song makes you feel like you’re a beat cop who owns the town, with its semi-’70s sound. It’s a familiar aesthetic and can also be heard in fellow Montreal band Bran Van 3000’s song “Astounded." It’s long, it’s bizarre… and it’s brilliantly, uniquely Arcade Fire.
 
"Revolution"
Diplo, "Revolution"
Ironically betraying its namesake, “Revolution” gives way to common gimmicks partway into the song. Beginning with a satisfying bassline which thrums through the song, the composition devolves into a stuttering of beats and ditches its once interesting and meaningful lyrics in favor of repeating the name of the song at various lengths: “It’s a revolution, It’s a reva, rev.” In fact, the song seems primed for further evolution, seemingly designed for future remixes and collaborations. For now though, let’s hope subsequent releases will see a return to the snappy, upbeat tempos heard in the producer’s “Blow Your Head” EP.
 
"SMS (Bangerz)"
Miley Cyrus, "Bangerz"
“SMS (Bangerz)” brings with it a few hints of country twang, not heard since Miley Cyrus sang in her Hannah Montana persona. In an attempt to prove her newfound independence Cyrus assures: “I can stut that strut.” Lovely notes of vulgarity can be heard in the lyrics:  “They ask me how I keep a man—I keep a battery pack.” Just when you thought that this song couldn’t get any better, we are offered up a rap feature courtesy of Britney Spears. However, despite the fact that it may be lacking in substance, it’s hard to deny the fact that the song—which is heavily influenced by Salt n Pepa’s hit “Push It”—is terribly catchy and shamefully addictive. Expect it to top charts and land on “guilty pleasure” playlists worldwide.

Sheema Golbaba ’14, budding documentary filmmaker and senior in Dunster House, may most often be seen on campus commanding the intramural soccer pitch or socializing with friends. But Sheema’s exploits extend far beyond such local domains: her documentary films have won her widespread national recognition, and she was even a production assistant on Oscar-nominated “The Invisible War.” Producing original work on topics ranging from national identity to race riots, Sheema Golbaba works to portray the stories she sees around her through film.
The Harvard Crimson: Has your upbringing in Tulsa, Okla. influenced your path to filmmaking?
Sheema Golbaba: Oklahoma is a beautiful place. People genuinely want to talk to you, and so you can talk about anything to a stranger, and it won’t be weird…. That sort of hospitable culture juxtaposed with [my family’s] very loving, kissing and hugging, very intimate Iranian culture was very instrumental during my developmental years…. I think being able to connect with people is one of the most important traits someone could have, regardless of where you are. And that’s, I think, the number one thing I took away from Oklahoma.
And now as a budding documentary filmmaker, I’ve realized that the reason I love documentary filmmaking is because I love stories...and making those stories feel relevant. Even if it’s something on the obscure corners of the world, something totally irrelevant to you, I want you to feel passionate about it in some way or another.
THC: How did you develop your interest in film?
SG: When I was 14 I applied to a broadcasting program at my school, and I loved it. I loved going around and talking to people and learning about them, and eventually it turned into this more research-oriented documentary stuff…. I didn’t consider it a serious part of my life and [never thought], “Hey, this could be something you’re actually good at,” until my senior year. I created a film about the Tulsa Race Riot of 1921…. I ended up interviewing a survivor of the race riot and that interview was six hours long…. Hearing...this guy who at five years old had his home burnt down [say], “All I had was the clothes on my back”.... That sort of awoke some sense of this [being] important for non-subjective reasons.
THC: Why have you chosen to pursue an education at Harvard, rather than focusing exclusively on film?
SG: I ended up applying to USC Film School, which is like the Harvard of film school, and somehow managed to get in…. I went to visit USC to interview for my scholarship, and I remember I asked one of the professors when I would have time to read books. He sort of chuckled and said I wouldn’t have time for that. And that really bothered me.And then I got into Harvard and realized that...the reason I loved filmmaking is because I love learning about other people’s stories and how to make that relevant to other people—what are the conditions surrounding them, why is it important to them, and why should it be important to us.… Everybody loves stories. That’s why we have books and why we read to each other when we’re little…and that’s why I wanted to come here. I wanted to learn about the fundamentals of the world that surrounded me and everyone else around me, and now I’m a joint concentrator in Sociology and VES.
THC: How do your studies in Visual and Environmental Studies and Sociology complement each other?
SG: Sociology is the study of society. So you’re learning about notions of identity, about immigrants, political movements, social movements, why people make certain decisions based on what they see around them and feel around them.  That coupled with a camera is tremendously powerful.
THC: How have you evolved as a filmmaker over the course of your career thus far?
SG: I’m a pretty stubborn person, and luckily I’ve had some great professors here at Harvard who have very intentionally challenged me until I’ve felt like I’m on the verge of losing my mind. So now I’ve learned to go into a project with an idea, but to be okay with changes that naturally occur. Because that’s a story in and of itself. That’s my own story.

The unconventional, the whimsical, and the abstract all come together in “Amy Sillman: one lump or two,” the Institute of Contemporary Art’s exhibition of the New York-based artist’s unique sketches, video documentaries, and even iPhone-based drawings.  The exhibition, which opened Thursday and will be on view through Jan. 5, explores Sillman’s distinctive style and artistic evolution over the past 25 years, from her early playful beach landscapes to her later abstract and erotic depictions of shame-ridden lovers.
“[She] has avoided a signature style, preferring instead to let a cluster of interrelated questions lead the way for her aesthetic explorations,” said chief curator Helen Molesworth, as quoted on a wall at the gallery. Sillman’s aesthetic explorations are evident throughout the exhibit: while an initial splash of pastel colors and bright pinks and blues from her early works dominates the first two rooms, her recent work ventures into more abstract themes, with bolder brushstrokes and darker colors.
Sillman’s departure from conventionalism is clear from the exhibit’s very beginning, which features a series of unusual sketched portraits. The portraits are not simple images, but feature Sillman’s written commentary covering the faces of the subjects. Bold, black text reading “This painting was a total failure,” for example, is slapped on top of a image of a young man.
Much of Sillman’s newer work, too, has been completed using innovative methods: she has frequently drawn not from life but from memory. For example, the exhibit features a series of her works from 2007 in which she observed lovers interacting with one another and then drew entirely from memory. She has also utilized technology in her artistic innovation, and included in the exhibit are a series of drawings Sillman created with an iPhone application.
Many of her more recent works depart from the playful and lighthearted tendencies clear in her early pieces. As one progresses through the exhibit, her paintings begin to explore psychological issues and human interaction. In her 2006 painting “Them,” for instance, Sillman addresses the question of human relationships. The abstract painting depicts faint human figures sitting with one another, indistinguishable expressions on their faces. A blurb accompanying the work claims that the painting attempts to enlighten viewers of the complexity of human interaction.
In another piece, entitled “Me & Ugly Mountain,” Sillman depicts the emotional and physical baggage that people hold onto throughout their lives. With her definite horizon lines, thick brushstrokes, and an off-hue yet still colorful palette, Sillman boldly draws to tell her viewers to lift themselves of any baggage in their lives, whether that be the people that bring them down or their everyday emotional stresses.
One of Sillman’s most recent pieces, a group of drawings titled “A Shape That Stands Up and Listens,” shows just how she embraces the unconventional in her abstract work. The piece is a group of sketches in which Sillman attempts to recall all the rooms in which she has felt shame and represents such rooms with muted textures, confusing lines, and dark overtones. From the vagaries of distant memories, Sillman’s faint outlines of furniture and people in these rooms are both haunting and relatable, like most of her recent work.
In representing the path of Sillman’s artistic evolution and demonstrating her ability to use novel and timely techniques, “one lump or two” makes clear both the diversity of Sillman’s work and her influence. “Sillman is central to the resurgence of artistic, public, and critical interest in painting and abstraction today,” said Jill Medvedow, Ellen Matilda Poss director of the ICA, in a statement. “This exhibition is a long-awaited opportunity for a close encounter with the emotion, awkwardness, energy, and sheer beauty of [her] art.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Few Harvard students frequent the Student Organization Center at Hilles, the multipurpose building that watches over the southwest corner of Radcliffe Quadrangle. Even fewer take the elevators to the penthouse, the ghostly top floor of the SOCH that greets visitors with unused study spaces, a barren lounge, and a once-functional café closed by the College in 2009 in the midst of $77 million in budget cuts. But the deserted penthouse boasts something that no place in the Yard can offer—deep in its hollows, unbeknownst to most students, is a recording studio.
Six years after its opening, the space has fallen into disuse. The student-run recording studio was equipped with modern technology and expensive software, and it initially created a buzz among the diverse group of musicians on campus. In a Crimson article published on the eve of its 2011 relaunch, co-founder John A. Ausick ’13 mentioned that he hoped to “develop a musical community centered around the recording studio.” Eventually, however, complaints began to outnumber the compliments as the studio gained a reputation for being messy and disorganized. Though efforts to unite campus musicians are underway, for now the musical community at Harvard is as incohesive as it was when the space first opened. What happened to the studio and the vision that inspired it?
OFF-AIR
The SOCH studio may bill itself on its website as “a perfect way for student musicians to learn more about recording techniques,” but students tell another story. Even among those who know of its existence, the SOCH’s studio is more of an afterthought than a popular destination. Of the countless musicians on campus, only 124 have undergone the training process necessary to get swipe access to the studio, and even fewer use it regularly. Calvin K. W. Chin ’14 is one of those few, and he found out that the SOCH had a recording studio not by word of mouth, but independently through the SOCH’s website. He explains that the recording studio is a convenient place to play music with his friends, but not user-friendly to students with little or no recording experience.
“I’ve not used it a single time to record anything,” Chin says. “I suppose it’s a good space for recording, but I haven’t recorded because I have no idea how to use the adjacent room.” The recording studio is divided into two spaces—one larger room for rehearsing and playing music, and one smaller room for mastering tracks. This smaller room contains a computer equipped with digital audio workstations and a pair of monitor speakers, from which musicians can record and mix the tracks played from the practice room. Students say the training process, in which students are granted access to the studio after demonstrating competence to the studio manager, is far from rigorous and leaves them with little comfort using the expensive and arcane equipment. Like Chin, some feel that the process of using the studio could run more smoothly.
For Taylor A. Cressler ’14, however, the studio is a valuable resource for making high quality recordings. As president of the Harvard College Voice Actors’ Guild, Cressler sometimes brings voice actors to the SOCH to record radio plays, poems, and short stories. Though Cressler does know how to use the equipment and needs only one microphone to record speech, he has still found the studio difficult to navigate.
“It’s very hard to find things,” Cressler says. “I did have one experience where I went to the SOCH to record something with a bunch of my actors, got there, and couldn’t get into the cabinet where all the microphones were.” To students like Cressler, such difficulties deter them from frequenting the SOCH’s recording studio, and they often find themselves disappointed with their experiences there. Cressler agrees that there are many drawbacks to working in the recording studio, such as the disarray in which its users often keep the practice room—by the end of the semester last year, the room was covered with cables, amplifiers, drumsticks, and boxes full of CDs and band t-shirts.
“I think the policy is ‘clean up after yourselves,’ but that doesn’t usually happen,” Cressler says. “Things go missing from there all the time. There are wires everywhere. And I’m also pretty sure that very few, if any, people actually know how to use the software that’s on the computer and the equipment.”
A SILENT COMMUNITY
The underuse of the recording studio is just one corner of a largely discouraging picture of the independent music scene at Harvard, which includes artists in every genre, from hip-hop to indie rock. In many cases, classes begin to take precedence over the arts, and outside of official extracurricular groups, it is difficult for many students to come up with a legitimate excuse to pursue their music. Rapper Zak T. Aossey ’14 has fortunately been able to balance his academic career with football and music. He speaks passionately about his experiences and the mixtape he plans to release this fall. When asked about Harvard’s attitude towards its musicians, however, his voice becomes noticeably sharper.
“There are not a lot of resources to the music-making community [at Harvard],” Aossey says. The House music rooms, he says, have little to offer. “When I want to go practice or write, I maybe go to one of the music rooms here, but it’s like this 300-year-old room with a piano in it. There’s no equipment, there’s no resources for us, so it’s really hard as a musician to make your material on campus and keep your college lifestyle.” A former frequenter of the recording studio in the SOCH, Aossey recently left the free on-campus resource in favor of a professional studio near Davis Square because at this point in his career, he felt that the difference in quality was worth both the distance and price. Despite his choice, Aossey emphasizes the importance of maintaining the SOCH’s recording studio.
“There are a lot of artists on campus…. People need a place to go record their music,” Aossey says. “It’s really expensive to go to studios and to have an engineer working with you—so if they gave us that outlet and if they gave us a quality place to record our music, we would be representing Harvard with our creativity, and at the same time, we would have a tangible music resume to show the world.”
To musicians like Aossey on campus, the disuse of the SOCH’s recording studio represents more than a facility not living up to its potential—it has become the unfortunate symbol of a silent community. Chin notes that Harvard may be missing much of its student body’s musical potential. “There’s a lot of untapped talent,” Chin says. “Other than the big student groups…there’s a whole lot of other people who dabble in music, but I would say that it’s mostly underground and no one really knows what happens.”
Nobody knows this better than Evan B. Weiner ’15, who became the SOCH’s recording studio coordinator in April. Weiner, a bassoonist and drummer, has experienced both the organized arts and the underground music scene at Harvard. According to Weiner, it is a very specific but large fraction of the music scene that goes unnoticed at Harvard. “I play bassoon and I’ve done a lot of orchestras on campus, and that’s a fantastic community that exists and is thriving. I’ve got a lot of friends doing a capella—that’s another area of musicianship that’s great to get involved with,” Weiner says. “I think the options for people who don’t do music in those areas are more difficult to find.”
Weiner acknowledges the negative reputation the SOCH’s studio has gained of late, but he is enthusiastic about the potential growth of the music community as the SOCH begins to hold more events and live shows that feature student-made music. His vision is to address the disuse of the studio by creating a student-led community focused around collaborative events. The recording studio, according to Weiner, “doesn’t exist without the other dimensions of a live music community.”
However, some students think that a bigger push from the administration would be necessary for the music scene to genuinely take off. James E. Dickerson ’14 has used the studio as a practice space since his freshman year. Former Musicians’ Representative for the Kuumba Singers (who rehearse in the penthouse of the SOCH), Dickerson believes that the community won’t grow without official recognition.
“My sense is that to have continuity beyond four years, it’s going to take an actual effort from the administration or from OSL,” Dickerson says. “There are many ways that could take shape, but I think that would definitely be a good goal moving forward to concretize the community.” Dickerson cites songwriting classes, workshops, and an official leader of the community as examples of steps that the administration could take to foster the school’s independent music scene. But to even ask the College for help first requires more organization than this extremely eclectic community currently has.
COLLABORATIVE TRACKS
Fortunately for Harvard’s musicians, Weiner and the SOCH are not alone in the quest to bring together the independent musicians of Harvard. Besides the countless musicians who would benefit from it, the studio has a powerful ally in Quad Sound Studios, a student group that runs another on-campus recording studio in the basement of Pforzheimer House. Unlike the SOCH’s studio, QSS offers sound engineering training to teach students how to produce musical recordings. Musicians interested in using their studio then get matched with one of these trained engineers. Around since the ’80s, QSS launched a major renewal effort in 2012 under the leadership of Matthew P. Sheets ’15. The president of QSS has bright ideas for the two studios’ futures.
Collaboration seems to be the cornerstone of the two groups’ efforts, which is reflected in the relationship between the studios. Instead of being a competitor to the SOCH recording studio, QSS looks to serve the same community in a different way. “Different use cases, but one community,” Sheets says, explaining that the two groups serve slightly different purposes. Whereas the SOCH’s studio is a more flexible creative space in which musicians can record, write, and rehearse music, QSS is a more traditional studio, allowing students to reserve the room and setting them up with students who have been trained in sound engineering. Both QSS and the SOCH’s recording studio will turn towards addressing the needs of the musicians on campus. “We really view the studios as a means towards supporting and helping build upon and create this community,” Sheets says.
“The cool thing about a recording studio is that it’s genre-less,” Sheets adds. “Every genre records, so it creates an opportunity for everybody to mingle together in the same place.” According to Sheets, uniting Harvard’s musical community will act as positive feedback for the musicians and encourage musical partnership. “When you do recordings, you get collaboration between different genres, which is the ultimate goal.”
Both Sheets and Weiner envision this growth of an independent musical scene at Harvard, fueled by cooperation and encouragement from fellow musicians. In this light, the SOCH recording studio may act as something tangible around which to organize. To supplement this, Sheets and Weiner have created an online musical community where Harvard students can find future bandmates or look for collaborators.
“It’s called Quad Sound Connect, and it has existed, but basically isn’t populated,” Weiner explains. “What we’re hoping [for] that to be is a database open to anyone at Harvard College, and you’ll be able to put up biographical information as well as information about what you play and what kind of genres you’re interested in.” Sheets explains that Quad Sound Connect is currently being redesigned. In the meantime, he is focusing on the reopening of QSS’s studio, which he hopes will occur in the fall.
COME TOGETHER
A recording studio on campus is a valuable resource for every Harvard musician. But even more importantly, the College’s community of independent musicians seems to be at a crucial tipping point: many students have found themselves wishing that they were part of a more organized and recognized group. Dickerson has many ideas for expediting the process. “I could envision house-wide songwriting collaboratives, or even Harvard-wide things like that,” he says enthusiastically. “I think those would provide better opportunity for people to meet each other, especially to form bands or collaborate on songs. I definitely say there’s room for growth as far as cultivating the community of original songwriters and performers at Harvard.” The collaboration between the SOCH’s studio and QSS is the first step towards this goal’s realization.
“I think [the studio is] very much a single part in a much broader picture,” Weiner says. For many in the music community, this broader picture must incorporate some way of encouraging collaborative music efforts. Harvard’s independent musicians recognize the importance of Weiner’s vision of a united, invigorated music scene. As Chin puts it, “You have to make friends before you make music.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 18, 2013, at 10:49 a.m.
“As you live, believe in life! Always human beings will live and progress to greater, broader, and fuller life.”
W.E.B. Du Bois, Class of 1890, penned these words in his famous “Last Message to the World.” Harvard University took one large stride toward that greater life foretold by its first black Ph.D. on Oct. 2 with the official launch of the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research, funded by a $15 million donation from financier Glenn H. Hutchins '77.
We believe that the center is already a symbol of the enduring struggle for better race relations at Harvard.
It took the occupation of University Hall in 1969 for the African American Studies Department to be formed. Now, when students walk into the Hutchins Center, they will find that seven of the University’s existing initiatives dedicated to African and African American Studies, as well as four new initiatives, have been unified under one roof.
When tour guides lead their groups past the Hutchins Center, they will be able to say that housed in this building is the world’s premier center for African and African American Studies. In his opening remarks at the launch ceremony, Professor of African and African American Studies Henry Louis Gates, Jr. drew a thread through Harvard’s history, reminding all of those in attendance what it once meant to be black at this school. This is an institution that did not have a black graduate until 1869, that sent a black member of the lacrosse team to home in 1941 because the opponent, the United States Naval Academy, refused to play on the same field as a black student. This is an institution that before the 1960s had only a few black students each year.
Harvard has since transcended much of its troubled racial history, and the new Hutchins Center marks our University’s move toward something much greater. The Harvard of the past no longer exists because human beings, as W.E.B. Du Bois so eloquently put it, believed in life and our ability to make it greater.

An earlier version of this editorial incorrectly stated that the Hutchins Center had not yet opened. In fact, it opened October 2.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s rare that one has the chance to watch the birth of a social movement up close. But for the last few years I’ve had the opportunity to do just that. I first heard of what we now call “effective altruism” in high school, when Peter Singer came to speak at my school. I listened to his now-famous “child drowning in the pond” thought experiment:
“Imagine you’re walking to work, wearing a new $500 suit. You pass by a pond and see a small child drowning in it. You could jump into the pond and save the child, but it would ruin your new suit with water damage. What should you do?”
Predictably, we answered that we should save the child, no matter about the suit.
“But it turns out this trade-off happens all the time. The child may not be in front of you, but a $500 donation to charity can save a child's life in Africa. Does it really matter where they are physically located? Or is it just as morally important to save someone in Africa as in the U.S.?” Professor Singer concluded that morally, we ought to donate some significant part of our income to charity.
“That’s interesting,” I thought, and proceeded not to think about it for two years. He couldn’t seriously expect people to just give away a bunch of their money. That would be crazy! So he must have been wrong. And nobody would frown on you for failing to donate like they would for not jumping in the pond.
Still, though, the possibility that he might be right nagged at me. In moral debates with friends, I would sometimes take Singer’s position just to play devil’s advocate, and it was surprisingly easy to argue. At the same time, I found GiveWell’s charity evaluation research, demonstrating that it was actually possible to find organizations as effective as Singer’s suggestion of saving a life per $500. I got a job programming and learned for the first time what it was like to have extra money. (Shortly afterwards, of course, I unlearned this when I started paying tuition.)
Then I met Jeff Kaufman and Julia Wise, living proof that following Singer’s suggestion was not only possible, but fun, and required vastly less sacrifice than I thought. Jeff is a programmer at Google and Julia is a social worker; in 2012 they lived on $11,000 and donated $50,000. And yet they’re none the worse for it. Jeff is still a contra dance musician and caller; Julia can still write, go to museums and art galleries and concerts. And they’re still able to host potluck dinners for other local folks who share their ideals—effective altruists, as the movement has come to be called.
Some effective altruists, like Julia and Jeff, earn a lot of money and donate it. Others, like GiveWell's researchers, work on finding the best charities to donate to so that those donations have the greatest impact. Still others, like Peter Singer and his philosophical descendants, work on advocacy and outreach: spreading the ideas behind effective altruism and showing that anyone can make a huge difference by thinking about the best possible ways to spend their time or money. None of these people are crushed under the financial or personal burden of helping others. They’re all remarkably happy, and they live just like anyone else—except for the part where they save tens or hundreds of lives each year.
Meeting all these people was what convinced me that effective altruism is a viable thing to do with one’s life. Julia and Jeff are living well, having fun, and, of course, doing an enormous amount of good (their donations to the Against Malaria Foundation alone have saved upwards of 35 lives over the past three years). Since then, I’ve been trying to do more altruism myself through donating, writing about it, and running a campus outreach group, Harvard High-Impact Philanthropy, which brings in a series of speakers to discuss effective altruism.
Effective altruism is one of the most exciting, challenging, motivating and fulfilling things to spend your life on. I think GiveWell’s co-founder, Holden Karnofsky, put it best:
“Trying to maximize the good I accomplish with both my hours and my dollars is an intellectually engaging challenge. It makes my life feel more meaningful and more important. It’s a way of trying to have an impact and significance beyond my daily experience.”
This is what motivates effective altruists. It’s not some masochistic desire for self-sacrifice or a way of assuaging the guilt of privilege. It’s a genuine excitement that we have the ability to do so much to improve the world, and a desire to make the absolute most of it that we can.

No one better summarizes the shutdown impasse than Republican Representative Marlin Stutzman, who moralizes, “We’re not going to be disrespected. We have to get something out of this. And I don’t even know what that even is.”
How a party irrationally committed to the sabotage of a secret, socialist scheme to make Americans live longer could possibly seem unworthy of respect befuddles Rep. Stutzman. Better that the government remain closed and the Treasury careen towards default while Speaker Boehner figures out what goody bag he can scrape up to appease the Tea Party.
As damaging as they would be, the rational members of society hoped that the kamikaze urgency of the Republican Party would be dashed, as the ultimate evil—electoral defeat—loomed ever-nearer.  Leadership would pull back the lemmings before the political suicide was complete, they thought.
Instead, congressional Republicans are spinning—with remarkably straight faces—an alternate narrative where the shutdown is the consequence of Democratic intransigence and unwillingness to compromise.
Yes, President Obama is somehow guilty of obduracy for not voluntarily repealing his signature achievement because of manufactured preconditions on the other side. It’s as absurd as a blackmailer protesting his victim’s indelicacy for not surrendering with a smile. Even a mugger can empathize that his target might be less than rosy after their rendezvous.
Representative Randy Neugebauer, Republican of Texas, even made the honorable trudge to the World War II memorial, large flag ostentatiously stuffed in his suit pocket, to castigate a park ranger for denying entrance to veterans. “The Park Service should be ashamed of themselves,” the congressman unashamed of shutting down the Park Service said to the low-level employee.
My own representative, Republican Andy Barr of beautiful Lexington, Kentucky, also desperately wants to break into the chutzpah corps. Because I feel obligated to keep up with local politics, or perhaps out of some sort of undiagnosed masochism, I subscribe to Congressman Barr’s weekly emails detailing his various valiant attempts to defund Obamacare or defend Kentucky from the EPA’s “war on coal.”
This week was a little much, however. Embracing the sudden we-are-totally-open-to-compromise Republican talking point, he pens this brazenly Orwellian sentence, “The only way the government would shut down under this scenario would be if President Obama, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and their liberal allies continue with their my-way-or-the-highway approach of conditioning funding the rest of the government on rushing the implementation of an unpopular law that will increase health care costs, destroy jobs and drive long-term deficits.”
Never mind that it is literally the Republicans who are conditioning the funding of the government on healthcare—not the other way around. Or that the “rushed implementation” was scheduled since 2010 and has never changed. Or that the Affordable Care Act will not be the economic apocalypse (unlike, say, a first-time default on American debt?).
Yet it gets worse.
“I have voted four times to prevent a shutdown, and in the spirit of Henry Clay, will continue to urge all sides to negotiate and compromise to reach a fair solution,” Barr wrote.
Henry Clay, the Great Compromiser of American politics, who brokered deal after deal during the Nullification Crisis and slavery debates, attempted to keep a country from fracturing apart. Congressman Barr wants the government shut down until the Republican Party’s antidemocratic agenda (having run on—and lost—the presidential election over this issue) can be imposed on the people through the threat of economic catastrophe. The two men could not be more different—either in style or in spirit.
“All issues are political issues, and politics itself is a mass of lies, evasions, folly, hatred, and schizophrenia,” George Orwell wrote presciently in his essay, “Politics and the English Language.”
But my two senators are not ones to let the freshman representative steal the scene. A hot mic caught Senator Rand Paul strategizing to Senator Mitch McConnell that “I just did CNN. I just go over and over again: ‘We’re willing to compromise, we’re willing to negotiate.’”
At least the presidential hopeful recognizes the necessity of breaking just before the brink. McConnell, facing a tough re-election campaign back home in 2014, dove into Orwellian oratory by noting on the Senate floor, “Democrat leaders in Congress finally have their prize — a government shutdown that no one seems to want but them.”
Sigh.
It might be impossible for my representatives in Kentucky, but to the rest of Congress: May the spirit of Henry Clay be with you.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Hall chamber was a spectacle of yellow and red stickers and posters as United Steelworkers Union school bus drivers as well as opponents of the Cambridge Housing Authority’s public housing smoking ban came out in full force to Monday’s City Council meeting to advocate for their respective issues.
After a nearly two-hour-long public hearing and lengthy debate, the Council unanimously adopted Vice Mayor E. Denise Simmons’s amended policy order strongly urging the CHA to continue public discussion of the smoking ban until August 2014, when the ban is scheduled to go into effect. The original version of the policy order had urged the CHA to reopen the public decision about the issue.
Smoking ban opponents, who were in favor of re-opening or at least continuing discussion on the smoking ban, pointed to what they described as flaws in the survey that the CHA cites as evidence of public housing tenant support for the ban.
The survey states that 79 percent of surveyed residents support the smoking ban, but ban opponent Jean Hannon argued that there were too few respondents for the survey results to be meaningful.
“The 79 percent is 79 percent of 538. It is not 79 percent of 25,000 households or 38,000 residents, so that the 79 percent in support of the policy actually drops to 11 percent,” Hannon said during public hearing. “I believe the public process needs to be reinstated and started again because the residents feel very disenfranchised by this whole policy.”
Bill Cunningham, another ban opponent, noted during public hearing that the petition circled by the opposition to the ban had already garnered 800 votes, more votes than the entire pool of residents in the CHA housing survey.
Don Summerfield, a member on the CHA’s Healthy Air Initiative Steering Committee that came up with the smoking ban proposal, defended the CHA, saying that months had been spent on this issue and that the decision “had not been taken lightly.”
“Smoking is impending my right to live at peace in my home. Please do not open this up to the public; leave it the way it is. I ask all of you to not delay this ban. [Smoking] creates a hazard for health and safety,” said Summerfield, who was the only one who spoke in favor of the smoking ban in the open forum.
Speaking during public hearing, Lee Jarvis, a ban opponent, summed up the core tension of the debate between public health and the rights of public housing tenants. Jarvis argued that smoking bans in private spaces should not be implemented until the entire country is ready to ban public smoking, emphasizing that public and affordable housing tenants should have the same right as private property owners.
“I should say that I hate smoking. My dad died of smoking—lung cancer—when I was 13,” Jarvis said. “There are other ways of solving the problem, like separate buildings, which Cambridge has apparently not tried.”
Councillor Kenneth E. Reeves ’72 agreed with Jarvis that it was problematic to ban smoking for tenants when smoking was still legal. Reeves said that this was a social issue rather than one of legal concerns.
“Maybe tallness will be the next issue,” Reeves said.
Councillor Marjorie C. Decker, who grew up in Cambridge public housing, said she thought it was important to safeguard the dignity and rights of public housing tenants.
“It is about trying to protect the individual rights and liberties of tenants who live in public housing at the same time as somebody has to protect the children. This is an issue [the children] can’t protect themselves for,” Decker said.
But not all councillors saw the issue in as stark of terms. Though he voted in favor of further discussion of the ban, Councillor Timothy J. Toomey Jr. highlighted the ability of private homeowners to prohibit smoking in private rental units and the fact that some private housing tenants face smoking bans as well.
“I just want to point out that [the smoking ban] is not groundbreaking,” Toomey said.
At Monday night’s meeting, the Council also adopted a policy order urging Charles Winitzer, president of Eastern Bus Company, to start negotiating with the United Steelworkers Union.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Less than a week after University President Drew G. Faust released a letter reaffirming the University stance against divestment from fossil fuels, divestment advocates said they remain unsatisfied with Faust’s position and will continue their activism.
The activists—an assortment of students, faculty members, and alumni—have emphasized the moral value of divestment and questioned Faust’s claim that Harvard could address climate change by engaging with fossil fuel companies.
In her letter, which explained the University’s longtime position, Faust argued that divestment could potentially politicize the University’s $32.7 billion endowment, divert focus from Harvard’s other environmentally-oriented initiatives, and weaken Harvard’s investment returns without significantly impacting fossil fuel companies.
Responsible Investment at Harvard, a coalition of Harvard affiliates that played a role in the creation of Harvard’s social choice fund, addressed Faust’s letter in a statement posted to its website on Monday.
“Responsible investing requires clear standards, transparency, and accountability to stakeholders who include students, staff, alumni, and communities where Harvard’s investments operate,” the statement read. “If Harvard is making any effort to this end, it is falling short.”
The group refuted Faust’s argument that Harvard could influence the fossil fuel companies associated with the University’s endowment. Harvard has a “poor history” of engaging with companies and asset managers to mitigate risks, the statement said.
Harold N. Eyster ’16, a member of Divest Harvard, a pro-divestment campaign affiliated with Harvard Students for a Just and Stable Future, said he agreed.
“Harvard has tried [engagement], and it hasn’t worked,” he said, adding that the Corporation has not demonstrated an interest in actively working with the fossil fuel companies in which Harvard invests.
Eyster also said that while some of Faust’s arguments discussed the financial impact of divesting from fossil fuel companies, divestment primarily serves a moral goal, not a monetary one.
“There really is not a neutral position here,” he said.
According to Eyster, Divest Harvard, which has yet to release a full response to Faust’s letter, plans to articulate its argument in op-eds in both The Crimson and a “major news source” within the next week.
Bill E. McKibben ’82, an environmentalist and staunch alumni advocate of Harvard’s divestment, called Faust’s letter “entirely expected” given the University’s initial resistance to students who pushed for divestment from South Africa in the 1980s and, more broadly, what he called the “very conservative” nature of Harvard.
Like other divestment supporters, McKibben—a former Crimson president—said he viewed the letter as inspiration for further action.
“It’s time to start campaigning in earnest,” he said, calling for students, faculty members, and alumni to rally in support of divestment. Alumni, he said, could request that their donations be held in escrow.
Other members of the Harvard community involved in environmental issues praised Faust’s statement.
In an emailed statement, Harvard Kennedy School Robert N. Stavins said that he believed Faust made the right decision.
“Divestment would at best be a symbolic action only, without meritorious direct effects,” he said. “The problem is that symbolic actions often substitute for truly effective actions by fooling ourselves into thinking we are doing something meaningful about a problem when we are not.”
He argued that viewing divestment as a “moral crusade” would hinder society’s ability to tackle climate change and that instead, Harvard could best fight climate change through research, teaching, and outreach.
The reiteration of activists’ goals comes as a study conducted at the University of Oxford found that the contemporary fossil fuel divestment movement outstrips similar campaigns against tobacco, apartheid, and pornography in terms of scope and impact.

It rarely happens that an American author writes a book about Japan that becomes a bestseller there, and it is even rarer for the same author to repeat that success in China with a book about China. Over the course of his career, sociology professor emeritus Ezra F. Vogel accomplished both feats.
In a talk Tuesday afternoon, Vogel discussed the complexities of selling his 2011 book “Deng Xiaoping and the Transformation of China” in the Japanese and Chinese markets.
The lecture was part of a semester-long seminar series on U.S.-Japan relations sponsored by the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs.
Much of the talk focused on the process of publishing Vogel’s book, which evaluates the long-term impact of Deng’s leadership role in China. The book chronicles Deng’s success in forging a new era for the country at the end of the last century.
China’s strict censorship policies posed significant challenges to Vogel in trying to publish his book.
“I learned a lot about [the censurers’] objectives while I worked to get the book published,” he said.
Vogel chose to first publish an uncensored version of the book in Hong Kong before he moved on to the mainland market.
“The propaganda department discouraged discussion of the book before the annual anniversary of the Tiananmen Protests to prevent demonstrations,” he said.
Though Chinese officials altered some parts of the book, Vogel said he was glad that more than 90 percent of the book’s original text remained.
He also expressed satisfaction at the book’s success in shifting conversations within China about the Tiananmen protests.
“My saying these things about Deng Xiaoping expanded the range of acceptable discourse,” he said. “The government may have decided that the book was a good way of releasing basic facts about the reaction to the protests.”
Vogel also discussed the differences between the Chinese and Japanese reactions to the book.
“Many of the questions people, and especially students, posed in China about the book’s content were very frank,” he said. “U.S. perceptions of China being a closed, authoritarian state undermine the vitality of these types of discussions there.”
He also noted, however, that popular reactions in Japan were vastly different.
“People reacted with less interest in Japan to Deng Xiaoping,” he said. “Instead, they were intensely concerned about current Sino-Japanese relations.”
Recent territorial disputes and military escalations over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands,a group of islands in the East China Sea that are claimed by both countries, contributed to this difference, according to Vogel.
As the 110th anniversary of Deng’s birth approaches next year, Vogel said he expects a renewed Chinese interest in the former leader.
“A lot of readers in China just want to know what’s going on,” he said.

Contrary to popular belief, money can buy happiness if spent correctly, according to Harvard Business School professor Michael I. Norton, who spoke to a packed auditorium in Boylston Hall Tuesday evening.
“We’re asking people to think broadly,” Norton said. “‘What am I doing with my money and should I be doing something else with it?’”
Norton co-authored the book “Happy Money: The Science of Smarter Spending” with Elizabeth W. Dunn ’99, a professor at the University of British Columbia. In their book, the pair researched how alternate ways of spending money can actually increase an individual’s level of happiness.
Specifically, they considered how the act of giving money can increase contentment.
“There are other things that are important to happiness that go beyond just focusing on ourselves the whole time,” Norton said.“You get more happiness out of giving than out of getting.”
During the lecture, Norton shared with the audience an experiment he conducted in Vancouver, Canada with Dunn in 2006 to test the correlation between spending and happiness.
The researchers conducted the experiment with two groups of students, according to Norton. Norton said each group received the same amount of money, but the individuals in one group had to spend money on themselves, while the individuals in the other group were told to spend the money on other people.
Norton said the research team then asked the students to report on their level of happiness after spending money, and, according to Norton, the results were conclusive.
“We saw that people who spent money on themselves were not unhappy—it’s not bad to spend money on yourself—but it doesn’t do that much for you, whereas spending money on someone else tends to make people happier,” Norton said.
The team conducted similar experiments in 136 countries.
Norton said that spending money on other people decreases stress levels by inhibiting the release of the hormone cortisol. These results hold particular significance for college students, Norton said.
“It seems today that when we give people advice about how to spend their money, they often feel overwhelmed that they’ll have to make enormous changes about how they live their lives,” Norton said. “But you don’t have to give a million dollars to charity to get happy.”
During the lecture, Norton discussed making research more accessible to the public. Norton said the target audience for his book was the “average smart person,” and he tailored his language toward this demographic.
Attendees at the event said Norton’s research was in fact not difficult to comprehend.
“Mike Norton understands the importance of explaining academic research in an engaging way,” Carmen D. Nobel, a senior editor for the HBS Working Knowledge forum, said.
Extension School student Katherine Scott agreed with Nobel and said she found the research practical and informative.
“Psychology and happiness sometimes seem like immeasurable things,” Scott said. “I loved hearing the research behind it and how they figured this stuff out.”

Nothing. You stare through the tiny window at your empty mailbox with a twinge of bitterness and wistfully glance over at all the other packages in the mailroom. It’s week seven, and you still haven’t received the treasured care package. Your roommate is inundated weekly with his favorite candy bars and cereal, while you get by on the packages of ramen you bought from CVS and the hope that one day you can earn your parents' affections. Things must change. Here are some tactics to get your much-needed mid-semester care package and prove to everyone that maybe your parents do actually care about you.
1. The Guilt Trip
The next time your parents call/text/make contact, emphasize how much you miss home. Drop not-so-subtle hints about how the thought of Swedish Fish and your favorite granola bars are the only things getting you through the semester. Complain about your study schedule and how sometimes you don’t even have time to grab a meal between classes. Your parents will be sure to pick up on your homesickness and desperate need for junk food.
2. Keeping Up with the Joneses 
 
So your parents dropped the ball and completely missed your message. It's time to appeal to their more competitive side. The next time your friend/neighbor/classmate receives anything in the mail, rave about the contents of the package and how awesome their caring family must be. Point out how Jenny's parents sent her fuzzy socks and hot chocolate just in time for the upcoming winter months. The thought of someone else’s parents getting such glory is sure to incite jealously in their hearts. They'll have to win this competition by sending you even more food and letters of love, so when your 20 lb. package arrives, be sure to praise their victory.
3. The Reciprocation
Your parents aren't the jealous type, huh? Well maybe their compassionate side will take over when you send them a letter. Making the first snail mail contact will force them to acknowledge that 1) you are their child, 2) you are missing home, and 3) you want something in the mail. A handwritten letter may require investment in a stamp and envelope, but it will tug at their heartstrings and appeal to their need to take care of you. They have to respond somehow, so at this point they're pretty much obligated to bake and send you some homemade cookies. It’s only common courtesy.
4. The Last Resort
You haven't made contact with your parents since you arrived on campus. They aren't returning your calls/you get sent straight to voicemail/you can't get past their secretary. None of your mail can be delivered because they have actually moved since you left. It's time for Plan D. Order the largest pre-made care package you can find online. Include a heartfelt card with the delivery. Make sure everyone you pass on the way from the mail center to your room knows how much your parents care. Later, cry alone while eating your Snickers bars. Take solace in the knowledge that there are others that share your pain.

Midterms are upon us, and for every 15-page research paper on the history of Western Civilization, ridiculously difficult math hourly, and tongue-twisting Spanish speaking test, what better way to not study than to watch some brain stimulating, titillating television shows! The next time you find yourself in a strategically isolated cubicle at Lamont, whip out those headphones and check out these 10 funky, funny, and fresh shows. Trust us, this’ll be more entertaining than Facebook.
 
1. " Summer Heights High" (HBO)
If you haven’t heard of Chris Lilley, imagine combining the comedic genius of the entire "Saturday Night Live" cast with a seriously sassy Australian accent (just like that FIPper you met the other day), and you’ve got yourself the creator, director, and star of the hilarious “Summer Heights High”. Lilley essentially is the entire cast, playing three different characters in a New Zealand high school, from a ridiculously narcissistic private-turned-public schoolgirl to a misfit who has a penchant for drawing male genitalia in public to an incredibly flamboyant drama teacher. Remember, Lilley is a thirty-eight year old man. 
2. " Fresh Meat" (Channel 4)
This British Channel 4 comedy is exactly as it sounds—FRESH MEAT. Ok, well barring the meat, you have a bunch of “fresh” university students packed into one ramshackle house for their semester at Manchester Medlock University. The students’ personalities are prime: military-grunge, indifferent to the world Vod, optimistic good girl (with a crazy drug streak) Josie, and questionably old Scotsman Howard are just a few of the motley crew. Drama and hilarity ensues as awkward romances, fights, and friendships develop. 
3. " River Monsters" (Animal Planet)
Looking for a real-time, documentary-style reality show? From fish to guts to Jeremy Wade, "River Monsters" has got it all. Yes, this Animal Planet program is not for the faint of heart, but who doesn’t want to see a middle-aged salt-and-pepper Brit hoist up a gigantic pregnant sting ray or wade knee-deep in piranha-infested waters? From his epic journey across the Amazon River to catch a glimpse of impossibly sized catfish to his search across Europe for the mythical Loch Ness Monster, “River Monsters” is definitely a catch. P.S. Can he come to the Charles River?
4. " Australia’s Next Top Model" (FOX)
Don’t even bother watching “America’s Next Top Model,” because down under, they do it twenty times bigger. Boys and girls alike should watch the Aussie version of this show, not solely for its typical editorial photo-shoots, ridiculous Eleganza-esque shows, and crazy challenges, but also for its incredibly lax censorship. A wise man once said, models may be beautiful, but they have filthy mouths. 
5. "Homeland" (Showtime)
You already know that you should watch this show, so I’ll just give you one exceptional reason to get on the Brody train: Mandy Patinkin’s beard. Enough said.
6. "Skins" (U.K. version)
“Skins” is the classic British coming-of-age drama chronicling the struggles and successes of various teenagers living in Bristol, England. You’ll meet characters like Tony (Nicholas Hoult), the exceptionally good-looking and intelligent party boy, Pandora (Lisa Blackwell), the donut loving and incredibly naïve schoolgirl, and Alo (Will Merrick), the flaming ginger with a passion for dub step and cut-off shorts. 
 7. "Awkward" (MTV)
The name of the show says it all. Although high school student Jenna Hamilton is a train wreck most of the time—from an accidental slip in the bathroom that gets misconstrued as an attempted suicide, to seeing her guidance counselor hook up with her teacher—she always manages to pull through. So next time you find yourself in a sticky predicament, before you call mom or HUPD, just think, WWJD? (What Would Jenna Do?)
8. "Sleepy Hollow" (FOX)
This is your typical fantasy-history-mystery-drama-witchcraft show. Who knew Ichabod Crane could be so cool not to mention incredibly good-looking? (Mad props to Washington Irving and that random Expos reading that taught us who Washington Irving was!) The bizarre combination of modern day Westchester, New York and 18th century America witchcraft and apocalyptic fantasy somehow works as a police drama. Tune in if you’re about that headless horseman life.
9. "Shameless" (U.S. version)
“Shameless” is the R-rated "Cheaper By the Dozen." Main character Frank Gallagher (William H. Macy) is the Steve Martin of his clan, except for the fact that Gallagher is just about the worst parent you could think of. He’s an alcoholic, a raging drug addict, and a jobless money swindler—essentially UHS’s nightmare—and it’s up to his oldest daughter Fiona (Emmy Rossum) to take care of the family. The show is set in a crumbling south side Chicago house with Gallagher and his six children; what better way to capture the family dynamic?
10. "Elementary" (CBS)
With so many television and movie versions of Sherlock Holmes, you’d expect the Phoenix’s next party theme to be slutty Sherlock. Regardless, “Elementary” is CBS’s take on a modern-day Sherlock, and it’s brilliant. Bonus: Dr. Watson (Lucy Liu) in this version is female, and we just can’t help but think about those kick-ass images from her not-too-distant "Charlie’s Angels" days.
