After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
MAY 1
 
2014 Arts Medal Ceremony with Margaret Atwood (4 p.m., Sanders Theatre)
 
If the HUDS menu ever strikes you as something out of “Nineteen Eighty-Four” or “Never Let Me Go,” you’re not alone. The Canadian author Margaret Atwood MA ’62 set her 1985 dystopian masterpiece “The Handmaid’s Tale” in a future vision of Harvard (minus the tourists and plus some public executions on the steps of Widener). On Thursday, Atwood will receive the 2014 Harvard Arts Medal from President Faust. Atwood, also known for writing 2003’s equally dystopian “Oryx and Crake,” will discuss her life and works with host John Lithgow ’67. This is an opportunity to see a perennial Nobel Prize contender who’s still producing great works (see 2013’s “MaddAddam”) in conversation with the voice of Lord Farquaad—what’s not to love? Tickets are free but required for entry.
The Freshman Musical: 'HERO' (7 p.m., Agassiz Theatre)
 
Tywin Lannister, Simon Cowell…what’s the difference, really? “American Idol” meets “Game of Thrones” in this year’s Freshman Musical, “HERO,” running May 1 to 4 in the Agassiz Theatre. The show, directed by James M. Graham ’17, follows five contestants as they compete in front of a panel of three judges to see who can get the most medieval. “HERO” features an original book by Jacob D. Rienstra ’17 and music composed by Mayer M. Chalom ’17—in fact, as you may have guessed, everyone involved in the show is a freshman. Check out what Harvard’s youngest can do when left to their own devices! Tickets are $7, but students with a Harvard ID get in free on opening night.
An Afternoon with Speak Out Loud (2 p.m., Science Center C)
Harvard’s spoken word student group hosts guest poet Megan Falley, a professional writer and performer. A two-time winner of the Write Bloody Open Book Competition, Falley has one poetry collection published, with another slated to be released this fall. She also teaches an online poetry course called “Poems That Don’t Suck.” Come to Science Center C on Thursday to hear some poems that don’t suck, or even to perform your own during the open-mic session. Either way, this is a unique and informal opportunity to learn about spoken word and slam poetry, which are growing more and more popular and prominent both at Harvard and on the national stage. No tickets required.

MAY 2
 
Haydn’s 'Paukenmesse' and C.P.E. Bach’s 'Magnificat' (8 p.m., Sanders Theatre)
 
It’s the 300th anniversary of the birth of the Notorious C.P.E. (a.k.a. “Bachie Smalls,” the son of the slightly more prominent Johann Sebastian Bach)—what better way to celebrate than to join the Harvard-Radcliffe Chorus and the Pro Arte Chamber Orchestra of Boston for a performance of the composer’s underappreciated 1749 “Magnificat”? Director of the Harvard University Choir and Choirmaster of the Memorial Church Edward Elwyn Jones will also lead the two musical groups in a performance of Joseph Haydn’s “Paukenmesse,” or “Kettledrum Mass,” an anti-war masterpiece that predates the seminal hit by the Black-Eyed Peas, “Where Is the Love,” by just a couple centuries. Tickets are $10 for students.
Party on the Plaza (5 p.m., Science Center Plaza)
Join your friends, classmates, and absolute strangers on the Science Center Plaza for music and a non-HUDS dinner on Friday night. First, get alt-western with the alt-country sounds of the Cantab Cowboys, then get ambiguously funky to the creative collaborations of the ambiguously named Alex, Luke, Chris, and Friends. Finally, The Love Experiment, composed of Harvard alums and bandmates from The New England Conservatory of Music and Berklee College of Music perform neo-future-soul, a genre that should have more prominence than it does. If that isn’t enough to convince, you, two words: free t-shirts. Tickets are $17 for townies but free for Harvard students.
‘Fault’ (Thursday-Saturday, 8 p.m., squash courts in Murr center)
Who do you blame when it was no one’s fault? If you’re having a bit more of a tortured weekend, this workshop production is opening during Arts First, with the goal of developing towards a summer theater festival in New York. A 60-minute production written and directed by Lily R. Glimcher ’14, “Fault” follows psychologist Dr. Freeman as he realizes that his patients’ stories mirror some of his own childhood trauma. As his three patients work through their pain, the line between patient and doctor is blurred as Freeman begins to confront his own demons. Nothing like a little emotional digging to get your weekend started! Reserve your free tickets by emailing fault.tickets@gmail.com with your name, number of tickets desired, and showtime.

MAY 3
 
'SEESAW' (10 a.m., Science Center Plaza)
A dance installation choreographed by Dance Director Jill Johnson in collaboration with student choreographers, “SEESAW” considers and discusses artifice and agnosia through dance and was conceived and created using crowd-sourcing and improvisational technologies. It also uses texts by Confucius and René Daumal to provide governing ideas for the improvised passages of the piece. Though it originally premiered in November 2013, the performance promises to be just as original and unique this time around. Tickets not required.
Dancefest on the Plaza (1-5 p.m., Science Center Plaza)
This all-afternoon showcase highlights the range and diversity of Harvard’s student dance groups—this year’s lineup features the largest number of groups in the history of Arts First! New additions include the Harvard Breakers and Passus: Harvard College Step Team. Program A, which runs from 1-2:30 p.m., includes well-known groups like Bhangra, TAPS, the Harvard Ballroom Dance Team, and the Harvard Radcliffe Modern Dance Company. Program B, from 2:30 to 5 p.m., features performances from the Harvard Ballet Company, the Asian American Dance Troupe, and the Expressions Dance Company, among many others. It’s rare to see so many different types of dance from all over the world united in one afternoon, so Dancefest is one of the stand-out events of this year’s Arts First. No tickets required.
IGP Dinner Party Show (6:30 p.m., SOCH)
The Immediate Gratification Players, Harvard’s premier long-form improvisational comedy group, would like to treat you to dinner and a show. The entirely improvised performance will take place alongside a catered dinner. The IGP recently opened for Kathy Griffin and hosts an annual improv comedy festival that draws college performance groups from across the country. Known for their yellow and red neckties, the IGP are excited to both feed and entertain you, sort of like a date but hopefully less uncomfortable. No tickets required: reserve your free seat at immediategratification.com.
 
MAY 4
'1812 Overture' (3 p.m., Lowell House Courtyard)
Students who leave the same-day 1 p.m. Russian bell-ringing concert jonesing for more Eastern European percussion are in for a treat: the Lowell House Society of Russian Bell Ringers will be performing again later that same afternoon, this time playing one of Tchaikovsky’s most iconic pieces of music, “1812 Overture.” Fitting for a piece of music that commemorates the Russian defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Borodino, this performance will feature simulated cannon fire as one of its highlights. Admission to this outdoor concert, a long-standing Lowell House tradition, is free of charge—bring a lawn chair or a blanket and sit outside in the courtyard to enjoy the music.
Vijay Iyer: Jazz on the Plaza (2 p.m., Science Center Plaza tent)
As a MacArthur Fellow, a Grammy nominee, and a member of the Harvard faculty, jazz pianist and composer Vijay Iyer is about as decorated as they come. This summer, his sextet is set to perform at the renowned Newport Jazz Festival; for Arts First, the group will give a taste of what they will be performing their free of charge. Graham Haynes, Mark Shim, Steve Lehman, Haris Raghavan, and Tyshawn Sorey will be joining him in a star-studded jazz concert.
'Symmetry Breaking' (10 p.m., Farkas Hall)
Ever wondered what art had to do with Higgs bosons (or what Higgs bosons were in the first place)? “Symmetry Breaking” can help you find out. The project is a creative thesis by Mariel N. Pettee ’14, a joint concentrator in physics and mathematics whose accolades include being named one of the OFA’s “Emerging Choreographers” and having interned at CERN. “Symmetry Breaking” takes the form of a piece of installation art that lets viewers wander the gallery space freely, ensuring that each visitor will have a different experience of the piece. Combining music, movement, poetry, and, of course, science, “Symmetry Breaking” has something for everyone.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
This weekend, Harvard’s hallowed halls will fill with frenzied high-school seniors, scoping out a potential academic home. At the same time, we current students—whose empty Economics 10 lecture rows today seat hundreds of wide-eyed Visitasors—face a similarly daunting choice: What to do this summer?
Pre-frosh, are you choosing between Harvard and Stanford? (Way to go, big-shot. Stanford boasted the lowest acceptance rate in its history this year, proving itself more selective than any Ivy—but not Walmart.) Those good old cash-savvy kids here—the ones you knew had snagged jobs the minute they stopped showing up to the dining hall wearing suits—wrestle with a matching quandary. I-banking at BCG? Or starting up in San Francisco?
Choices like these can make or break you. So choose right.
Of course, interest comes first. If reading puts you to sleep but vectors in n-space wake you right up again, you might want to look a little ways down the Charles. On the same note, prospective interns who also like numbers—especially when they show up in six figures behind a dollar sign—probably shouldn’t seek out employment on Capitol Hill. The Hill, however, seems a great bet for those who enjoy getting bossed around. A pre-freshman with such a disposition could check out Columbia, where they set up your schedule for you—it’s like middle school all over again! Or if you reside on the opposite end of the spectrum and would appreciate too much freedom, take the 40-minute commuter rail to Providence this weekend.
Now for the obvious: location, location, location. First, weather. This might matter more for the pre-collegiate than for the pre-professional. After all, summer’s summer—almost anywhere will bring the heat, and nowhere will slam you with snowstorm after snowstorm after polar vortex. But New England winters surely will. If you can’t handle the cold, lounge on a California quad or enjoy edX from the comfort of your home. But rain and shine alone shouldn’t dictate your decision. Palm trees and beaches, vast ranges of mountains, a bustling metropolis, or… a conveniently located IKEA? Jobseekers contemplate the same question. In New York City, clubs and Chinese food beckon at all hours. D.C. offers food, fun, and Frank Underwood. Milwaukee provides a maximum of two of the three.
If taking a college’s spot into account only convinces you to cross Yale off the list, pre-frosh—you’re probably smart enough to have done it already—put other variables into play. Consider how an internship hunter might view Milwaukee: boring, but oh-so-cheap. Money grows neither on trees nor in a college student’s pocket. The city so nice they named it twice has it all, but for a price. That’s all well and good if your elevator rides reach a high enough profile to end up on Twitter (your salary hitting equally lofty levels), but public-service oriented plebeians aren’t quite so lucky. Pre-frosh, too, might shirk at the sky-high costs of many colleges nowadays. A number of institutions grant substantial financial aid. Just as some current students must forsake summer employment opportunities because they do not pay, many future students have to abandon educational ones when funds run tight.
Last but not least, the people. Each of us has an uncanny ability to read who, at least in our own estimation, sucks. Stay away from them. Don’t just go to school where you think students seem the smartest, and certainly don’t go where students act like they know they’re the smartest. Go where people seem like you, where you can imagine late nights with one, two, maybe three too many drinks and an equal quantity of quesadillas (we’ve got some good options around these parts). The same for the summer, though you’ll only find Felipe’s here and in New Orleans.
Or maybe forget it all. Maybe go with your gut. It sounds trite, sure. But when it comes to your summer job, do something you love. And when it comes to college, well…
Go to Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
It’s only after finishing a 15-page paper on the undercurrents of Jewish culture and Marxism in 1970s American folk music that you realize you’re in a bubble.
Harvard’s red-bricked, nostalgia-filled, mold-inundated learning facades (or, some would say, facades of learning) protect students from the real world and every practical skill one may need to survive in it. The openness of the liberal arts education forces every student into a backward retreat from the forward driving effort that got each student noticed by the admissions office in the first place. And that makes it sort of an anomaly in our culture—a highly valued four years that serve as an essential part of the American Dream, but also four years that work completely contrary to the driven, hard-working nature of that same Dream.
Simply put, it’s a highly inefficient step in an overall efficient path to achievement, serving as a break in the characteristically capitalist drive to success. 
It’s hard to say whether this bubble of inefficiency is really necessary. But I think if we analyze it on a smaller scale, we can see just how valuable this not-real-world inefficiency can be. And a perfect example can be found at Harvard—not it its halls of education, but rather in its halls of gestation.
Each House dining hall acts as its own mini bubble, existing to protect students from the papers, problem sets, classes, and office hours of the Harvard bubble at large. They allow each patron the opportunity to sit for a while, eat, and socialize after a long day, as students eat seconds and thirds in order to delay any chance of going back to the library or dorm alone. 
And I think the main reason why this small bubble survives at Harvard is its surprisingly inefficient and anti-capitalist policy: the compulsory, unlimited meal plan. Because every student pays for (or is funded by financial aid for) infinite, all-you-can-eat meals every semester, there is no reason to eat anywhere else. In addition, there is no incentive to avoid seconds or leave for more paying customers (since everyone has already paid anyway). The result is that each place becomes a kind of relaxed European café shelter in a larger, competitive academic world. 
However, everyone who has taken Economics 10 knows that choices are good. They make nice straight demand and supply lines that, when they meet, make everyone can get what they want at a price they are willing to pay. And people, on the whole, are happy.
But at the same time, socialist nations with more compulsory taxes, health care, services, etc. (especially from Northern Europe) occupy the top spots of the happiest countries rankings. And “socializing” nations, such as countries in Southern Europe, have cafés that serve not only as hubs of inefficiency, but also as hubs of happiness for people to enjoy their friends—their inefficiencies correlate with greater happiness.
So is forcing  every student, each with different dining habits and preferences, into the same meal plan inherently flawed or inherently beneficial? Well, at first glance, it seems more like the former. Like most mandatory programs, the compulsory unlimited meal plan is vastly inefficient. Let’s assume most students end up only going to lunch and dinner, meaning that they attend an average of 336 meals per year. Using some math (we Crimson columnists definitely know math), that comes to about $16.21 per HUDS meal. This may be a good price for a decent all-you-can-eat place. But when you’re getting meals at the same place every day, you’re not going to eat all you can eat. The result is that you end up paying more than double than you do at other student-frequented spots. In addition, many students believe that patrons often take more food than they can eat. That’s because taking extra bread, for example, doesn’t cost any extra dough, resulting in a large amount of food waste. And finally, when students decide to actually eat all that extra food they pile on their trays for free, they put a Harvard multiplier on the freshman 15, resulting in a less healthy student body (literally).
As a result of these many inefficiencies, students have argued against the compulsory meal plan, suggesting plans with more choices. And the meal plan has changed many times over the years.
But at a time when mental health is on everyone’s mind, the inefficiency of Harvard’s meals may just be what students really need. Eating at Harvard is not really about the food—you’re not really paying extra for the food, you’re not really wasting the food, you’re not really getting unhealthy from the food. Rather, you’re paying extra for the atmosphere around the food, you get social value out of the “wasted” nutritional value of every thrown-out meal, and you become more mentally healthy as a result of the few extra, losable pounds you gain.
So just like an educational bubble in a driven capitalist world, the dining hall serves as a fulfilling refuge in a driven academic world. And just like a liberal arts education, its inherent inefficiency is its greatest strength, making students happier and giving them support for later on, when doing “actual work.” Personally, I know that on most days, with a whole host of issues outside of Café Winthrop’s walls, there’s no other place I’d rather be. 
At least, not on Scheherazade Casserole night.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
To the (potential) Class of 2018:
You’ve probably heard this many times in the past few weeks or even months since your decision email arrived, but it’s worth saying again: Congratulations! We think Harvard is an excellent place to spend four years, and hopefully the upcoming days will display what this school has to offer.
That being said, it is important to remember that this “Visitas” weekend is Harvard’s moment to put on a show. In the space of three days, the University will try to sell itself to you. It will do its best to cast Harvard in the most alluring light.
There are certainly parts of the “true Harvard” that you will see this weekend. You’ll get a sense—maybe too much so—of what it feels like to live in a dorm, and you’ll perhaps even get a handle on the geography of the campus. Even more relevantly, this weekend will provide a sense of Harvard’s diversity—a mosaic of countries, personalities, and economic backgrounds.
In the middle of all this fun, we encourage to you remember that Harvard is primarily known for its academics, and for good reason. Try attending a lecture or reading up on what the courses of instruction have to offer. If you’re interested in law, take a stroll around the Law School campus. In addition to the social offerings, find out what extracurricular activities you might be able to pursue at Harvard. (May we recommend The Harvard Crimson?)
As with any school, there will be times at Harvard when you are overburdened with work and find yourself with no one to turn to. No college lives up to its brochures every day, and don’t make the mistake of expecting it to. Instead, it might be helpful to use this as an opportunity to reflect on what motivates you even when you’re down or facing adversity. And regarding one predictable type of adversity, are you the sort of person who loves building snowmen? Or would the thought of walking to class in a blizzard make you depressed?
When it comes down to it, only your heart can decide if Harvard is the right place. It’s easy to choose Harvard because of the school’s name brand. Some of you may have been told for years that enrolling in Harvard is all you should ever want. But if college marks a major transition into adulthood, it should also mark a transition to autonomy. This sounds redundant, but it’s worth emphasizing: Your college decision should be entirely yours.
And while taking care to put it in perspective, make the most of this weekend. For one, be smart: A hangover is doubly worse with a rescinded offer of admission. Just as important: Don’t be pretentious. Yes, you got into Harvard. But so did everyone else here. You will not be the best at everything, and you may not even be the best at anything. Still, that does not diminish your contribution. Your work ethic, your spirit, and your personality count much more than whether you are the smartest-sounding person in the room.
Also, don’t make assumptions. This is the flipside of the above, as you might expect everyone at Harvard to be up to their necks in pretension. They’re not. Be genuine with everyone you meet and you might leave this weekend with some newfound friends.
But most of all, no matter how closely you follow the rest of our advice—don’t go to Yale.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
It is a Thursday night and I am seated in my dorm room ferociously scribbling down things on my to-do list. I just finished watching a poignant documentary, “Mary and Martha,” which chronicles the lives of two women who lose their sons to malaria while traveling in parts of Africa. For a moment, I can vividly see the faces of the many malaria victims streaming with sweat due to a rise in body temperature that is a near-sure diagnostic sign for many people in this part of the world. “Dominic,” a voice in the back of my mind tells me, “those suffering young boys could have been you.” The voice is right.
 
About 12 years ago, I was lying on a hospital bed somewhere in western Uganda slowly recovering from yet another recurring bout of malaria. I was missing out on my second semester of third grade, and that meant not only falling behind in schoolwork but also losing the chance to laugh and play with my school friends. I, like millions more elsewhere in the world, was a young boy with dreams and aspirations. The difference was that I lived under constant uncertainty: I wondered whether I would come to achieve any of these dreams if I kept getting malaria.
Somehow, I survived, and today here I am, writing this piece. But what about my friend and classmate whom I will call Moses, who died of malaria during fifth-grade vacation? If I tell you Moses’s story and you multiply it time after time after time, you will gain some understanding about the impact that this curable disease has on public health and economies worldwide.
Moses was my best friend during fifth grade. He was a young and cheerful boy—perhaps a little too thoughtful for his age. Moses, though initially in the same year as my older brother, had become a member of my class after malaria left him unable to complete his end-of-the-year exams for the previous semester. Nevertheless, Moses was always optimistic and joyful. He seemed to particularly enjoy having conversations about his aspirations.
At times, though, Moses’s good cheer broke down. I remember one moment of our friendship with particular clarity: when Moses told me he feared he might not live to graduate from elementary school, as his health was continuously complicated by malaria. Indeed, that same year when we broke off for our midyear break, I learned that Moses had succumbed to a terrible fever. Whenever I think about his life and then mine, I shudder at the realization that just what happened to Moses could have happened to me. However, I feel more disturbed when I realize that Moses’s continues to be the fate for so many innocent children in many parts of Africa and Southeast Asia.
According to data published by the World Health Organization, malaria killed an estimated 482,000 children under five in 2012. This is equivalent to more than 1,300 children per day or nearly one child every minute. This problem along with many similar others usually results from a combination of both nature and economics. However, the extent to which people in most of the West are incognizant of such issues is a problem on its own. Even at institutions like Harvard, which pride themselves on the curiosity and worldliness of their students, many people ignore this problem. Perhaps this is because a lot of us do not have direct experiences with malaria, for instance. But we are all indirectly affected by what happens everywhere else in the world. When young people in poorer countries die of curable diseases like malaria, the global economy and the overall fitness of the human family both suffer.
The good news is that global malaria awareness is starting to improve. Harvard itself has started various initiatives, like “Defeating Malaria: From the Genes to the Globe” and the two student-run campaigns it sponsors, aimed at improving awareness and also finding innovative treatment and prevention methods. The “Mob Malaria” team is organizing a malaria flash mob at the Science Center Plaza while other students have organized a community-wide run to harness the unity and reach of the Harvard community in the fight against malaria. Both of these are small wins for the global campaign against malaria, but there is more work to be done. So today, on World Malaria Day, think of Moses and the children like him across the world, and think also of how you can help.

Ay prefrosh: LISTEN UP.
My name is Josh. Not to be confused with Josh from FM’s Advice to Josh column, which you should check out (here, here, or here). Anyways, I’m a very different Josh, though I too am a freshman here at the College. “The College” obviously refers to Harvard College. As you’ll soon learn, Harvard has its own lingo for everything (here’s a guide to get you started).
Many of you have lots of questions as you decide where to attend school, and consequently, once you choose Harvard, you may have questions about the transition and what life will be like here on campus. As the most freshman member of FM, I’ve been selected to answer some representative questions that the most ambitious of you have posted in your Facebook group (along with some questions I may or may not have come up with myself).
Here they are: 
So, I’m trying to decide between Harvard/Stanford/MIT/[insert small liberal arts school here]/Sewanee/Yale...etc. What do I do?
Congratulations! What you lack in humility you make up for in acceptance letters. Fishing for compliments isn’t a Harvard-specific term per se, but after seeing some of the open posts it might as well be. Real advice? Visit schools. If time or financial constraints prevent physical trips, or if you’re nervous about traveling to New Haven, get on the schools’ websites and start fishing around—see what speakers are coming, what events are listed under student life, and what the academic program is like. Do they have a chorus group to fit your style? Do they offer falconry lessons? After you’ve given off the façade that it was a tough decision, choose Harvard.
Are the classes really hard?
Great question youngin’. For the five of you that don’t come from Boston Latin or Trinity, there will definitely be an adjustment period. Hate sleeping on Thursday nights? Take CS50, Ec10 and Math 25 all of which have P-Sets due Friday. Looking for an easier course load? Throw in a gem or two. Still wondering what a gem is? Ask any undergrad that doesn’t spend the majority of his or her time in Lamont. Don’t know what Lamont is? (You didn’t read the guide I posted above—I don’t appreciate it.)
What type of social events does Harvard have for students?
Harvard-Yale:
1. A football game between H & Y that represents the oldest rivalry in college sports, with its origins in 1875.
2. The one day a year when Harvard students pretend like they care about sports
3. A raging weekend involving everyone…even freshmen.
Freshman Formal: This one is too good to be true. I don’t care who you are: you’re excited and getting dressed up for formal. From that cute girl in your Government section to your future best man, everyone will be there. Not sure whether or not to take a date? Couldn’t tell you. But, a bit of advice—learn from the Class of 2017 and don’t over do it, lest the venue decide to shut down the event for everyone.
Freshman-Faculty Dinner: Odds are, if you don’t go to Harvard/Yale or Freshman Formal, you’ll probably go to this one.
What’s up with all these weirds posts in the Facebook group?
I feel you on this one. A few days after I decided to enroll I hit up the Facebook group to see endless replies to “what’s your favorite vocabulary word?!” I had not heard of a single word posted. Nor could I pronounce them. Who were the 56 people responding? Where did they come from, and how did they know what an “eccedentesiast” is? Let’s just say while hundreds of kids are super active on Facebook, there are tons of other kids who look on in astonishment just like you. And, who knows, maybe that Facebook-celeb might end up being one of your best friends. Don’t have the mulligrubs. (See, maybe you can learn a thing or two from your soon-to-be peers!)
So, I want to have a joint concentration in biomedical engineering and human evolutionary biology but the junior year tutorial conflicts with what will be my math secondary’s mandatory Combinatorics at 11 a.m. on Wednesdays in 2017. What do I do?
What you need to do is chill.
I’ve heard that professors at Harvard don’t pay attention to their students because they’re all just there to do their own scholarly research. Is that true?
Harvard has a bad reputation for teachers who don’t care about their students. To all those haters perpetuating this erroneous image: stop. You’re not helping anyone. I’ve been blown away by the effort that teachers (in each of the eight courses I’ve taken thus far) have made to reach out to the students. From mandatory individual writing workshops to the Freshman-faculty dinner, you will have plenty of opportunities to meet some of the most distinguished scholars in the world. The professors are Harvard’s greatest asset. After the $32 billion endowment, that is.
Do people at Harvard do extracurriculars?
What do you think? Obviously. Next year, you’ll go to an activities fair where each club has a booth promoting their interests, some of which are dedicated to activities you could not fathom in your wildest dreams. Check it. Don’t see a club you’re looking for? Harvard (especially career counselors) encourages students to start one of their own. I’d highly encourage you to go check out as many clubs as you’re interested in. Exposing yourself to a wide range of people will make your time here all the more interesting. Pro-tip: If you want to annoy your roommate, just put down his email instead of yours on all the lists.
Farewell for now, but keep sending in those questions for next year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Nearly 1,285 students accepted to the Class of 2018 are expected to flock to Cambridge this weekend for Visitas, Harvard’s visiting program for newly admitted students.
The weekend marks the return of Visitas after its cancellation last year due to the Boston Marathon bombings.
The program, which is slated to run from April 26-28, falls closer to the May 1 deadline to accept a spot in the Class of 2018 than in previous years. Last year, Visitas was scheduled for April 20-22. In 2011, it was held from April 21-23, and in 2010, Visitas lasted from April 16 -18.
When scheduling Visitas, the Admissions and Financial Aid Office accounts for many different factors, including giving students ample time to prepare for the trip, according to Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Jeff Neal.
"The Admissions Office deliberately avoids scheduling Visitas to coincide with major religious holidays, including Passover and Easter, each of which change each year," Neal wrote in an email. "Finally, Harvard believes it is important to give every admitted student the time and opportunity to compare institutions."
Some students said that because of the late timing of Visitas, they will have already decided where they will attend college before travelling to Cambridge. Such students said that they hope Visitas will provide an opportunity to get to know current students, professors, and future classmates, rather than to inform their college decisions.
Diana M. Gerberich of Wolverhampton, Mass., who was admitted regular decision, said that she had decided to matriculate to Harvard shortly after being accepted, but is still excited for the weekend.
“Visitas is for getting me acquainted with my classmates, learn more about the programs, meet professors, and learn more about Harvard as a student,” Gerberich said.
She added that based on her discussions with other admitted students and the posts on the admitted students Facebook group, she felt that “it doesn’t appear [that most students] are using Visitas to help them make the decision, but to get a feel for the campus.”
When they arrive for the weekend, prefrosh will receive a red folder with a schedule packed with details about information sessions, receptions, and talks from various Harvard professors and administrators.
Undergraduate Council President Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15 will be hosting a satirical debate with his former UC running mate, Samuel B. Clark ’15, on Saturday to discuss the differences in academics, social life, and extracurriculars between Harvard and Yale. Mayopoulos said he plans to represent Harvard, while Clark will speak on behalf of Yale.
“Harvard and Yale have never had any serious rivalries and so I imagine the tone will be quite relaxed and will never escalate to yelling or vulgarities or obscenities,” Mayopoulos said.
He added that he thinks that visiting students will get an honest image of life at not only Harvard, but also Yale, and that the debate will be “even-handed.”
Hunter J. Stanley of Los Angeles, Calif., who is currently on a gap year, said that he hopes he can use Visitas to learn more about pre-orientation programs and interact more with his future classmates.
“I am definitely looking forward to meeting my other classmates from all over the world and get oriented with the campus a little bit,” Stanley said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Harvard Business School broke ground on the construction of the Ruth Mulan Chu Chao Center, a new facility for the school’s Executive Education program, on Thursday.
The building’s namesake, the late Ruth Mulan Chu Chao, was the matriarch of the Chao family, from which four daughters, including former U.S. Secretary of Labor Elaine L. Chao, attended the Business School’s MBA program.
The 90,000-square-foot facility will house meeting rooms, dining facilities, office space, and classrooms for use by the over 10,000 executives who participate in the Executive Education program each year, and is being funded through a $40 million gift from the Chao family to the Business School in late 2012.
Speakers at the ceremony included University President Drew G. Faust, Business School Dean Nitin Nohria, former Australian Prime Minister Kevin M. Rudd, U.S. Senator Ed Markey, Elaine Chao, and the Honorable Cui Tiankai, China’s Ambassador to the United States.
The Chao Center, Nohria said, will act as a hub for executives, students, and faculty members from across the Business School’s programs to convene and collaborate. He added that the building will do much to facilitate connections between the Business School and the rest of the University.
“As the Harvard Business School campus evolves, and Harvard University’s plan for the Allston Campus come to life, [the Chao Center] will become a gateway to the North, connecting us to Harvard University, parts of the University that lie north of the Charles River, [and] to Allston, the growing space on this side of the river,” Nohria said.
Nohria also emphasized the importance of the building in providing Business School community members with an environment in which they may collaborate, highlighting the importance of such spaces in a globalizing educational setting.
 
“It may seem odd that we remain so committed to building magnificent, distinctive, and functional physical spaces,” he said, alluding to the Business School’s recent expansion into the world of online education with its new online learning platform, HBX. “The real value of our buildings comes from the communities that they help create, the learning environments that they make possible, and the human interactions they generate. This can never be replicated in any other place than real physical spaces.”
The building marks the first at the Business School campus to be named after a woman, as well as the first building on the school’s campus to be named after an American of Chinese descent, according to a press release.
“We are so grateful because of what this building will do, bringing Executive Education participants together from all over the world to learn and to collaborate. But we are also so grateful because of what this building will be,” Faust said. “I take a special pleasure in the representation of so much of the power of women in this family that this building will represent.”

The Victorian house at 8 Prescott St., formerly the offices of the Harvard College Writing Program, will be converted into temporary lodgings for the house masters whose residences are scheduled to undergo renovation during the House Renewal process.
The move has prompted the Writing Program to relocate to 1 Bow St. The Program’s former home will first serve as the Dunster House Masters’ residence during the 15 months of construction on the house, according to Director of House Renewal Facilities Operations Planning Richard L. Picott.
Dunster is the first House in the University’s $1 billion House Renewal project to be renovated in its entirety. Construction on Old Quincy House during the 2012-2013 school year did not affect the Masters’ residences. Meanwhile, Leverett House Masters Howard M. Georgi ’68 and Ann B. Georgi have resided in a DeWolfe suite while construction takes place on on Leverett House’s McKinlock Hall.
As the renewal process continues on the remaining river houses, the building at 8 Prescott St. will likely continue to serve as swing housing for other house masters, according to Picott.
Dunster House Master Roger B. Porter said the Prescott St. location is currently undergoing a “large number of renovations” to convert the former office building into a space where he and his co-House Master Ann Porter can entertain the Dunster community.
“They’ve been checking in closely with us on how it’s going to be [made] into a living place,” he said.
Porter said he believes that he and his wife will be able to move into their new residence in early June, adding that he was “very impressed” with how the University has handled swing housing throughout the renewal process.
With their House Masters living at 8 Prescott St., much of the block will be occupied by members of the Dunster community. Dunster residents will live at student swing housing at 20-20A Prescott Street and the converted Inn at Harvard. They will also inhabit the same swing housing for displaced Quincy and Leverett students—apartment buildings at Hampden Hall at 8 Plympton St., Fairfax Hall at 1306 Mass. Ave., and Ridgely Hall at 65 Mt. Auburn St.—during the 2014-2015 school year.
The Writing Program, which oversees the Expository Writing as well as other resources like the Writing Center, moved its headquarters to 1 Bow St. in August 2013, according to an email from Karen Heath, the senior preceptor for the Writing Program.

In light of a proposal to establish the College’s first honor code, an ad hoc working group composed of faculty and administrators is working to identify possible points during the undergraduate experience to start conversations about academic integrity.
According to Stephanie H. Kenen, the administrative director of the Program in General Education, the working group, which convened earlier this semester, grew out of efforts from the Academic Integrity Committee—the body of administrators, faculty, and students that recently drafted a proposal for an honor code.
Kenen, who convened the working group with Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde, wrote in an email that the group is brainstorming at which points in time during a student’s four years at Harvard it would make sense to start a discussion about academic integrity. She cited freshman orientation, Expository Writing, declaring a concentration, and applying for fellowships as examples of possible points of intervention.
“We’re going through major events of all four years and trying to find places where we think we can introduce some sort of conversation or activity around integrity,” said Michael C. Ranen, the resident dean for Ivy Yard and a member of the both the working group and the Academic Integrity Committee.
Kenen wrote that the group’s work aims to support the proposed honor code and the Academic Integrity Committee. According to Kenen, the working group may look at “projects based on existing programming” and “small pilots that we could try out next year and learn from.”
“We’re hoping to identify some low-hanging fruit,” Kenen wrote.
The Academic Integrity Committee’s proposal for an honor code is expected to go before the Faculty of Arts and Sciences for a vote at its next meeting in May. If approved, the proposal, as outlined in a draft on Jan. 10, would establish a student-faculty judicial board to hear cases of academic dishonesty and require students to sign a statement of integrity affirming their commitment to the honor code.
 
The working group includes a number of College staff members and representatives from the undergraduate concentrations. Kenen wrote that the group plans to present its findings to the incoming Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, who will assume the deanship on July 1. Khurana, who is also co-House Master of Cabot, sits on the Academic Integrity Committee and was one of several members of the subcommittee that drafted the language of the proposed honor code.
The group had met three times as of Tuesday, and would likely meet once or twice more, according to Kenen.

As part of a three-day think tank on education, a panel of professors and specialists convened in Longfellow Hall Thursday afternoon for a public forum titled “Educational Challenges of the 21st Century.”
Moderated by Graduate School of Education professor Fernando M. Reimers, the panel began with five speakers introducing topics that concerned them. Discussion ranged from the inequality of education standards across schools to youth unemployment rates and their relation to the education system.
“We have a youth unemployment rate that’s hovering 18, 20 percent,” said Nancy Hoffman, adjunct lecturer on education. “Countries like Switzerland and the Netherlands have rates in the single digits.”
The rest of the forum turned to a round of questions from audience members, who asked about a variety of topics—what it means for students to be college-ready, leadership roles in the educational system, and effective methods of evaluating teachers, a topic that prompted debate among the panelists.
Tufts University professor Amar Bhidé discussed the difficulty of evaluating a teacher’s impact on a student’s future. While a professor could make his students skilled for the time being, the current educational norms can become outdated. Just like certain technologies, though useful in the present, pedagogy can become obsolete, Bhidé said.
“Teaching is like putting a message in a bottle and putting it in the ocean,” he said. “You don’t know where it’ll end up.”
The comment prompted the other panelists to add their opinions.
“People try to oversimplify the teacher evaluation system,” Assistant Secretary for Elementary and Secondary Education at the U.S. Department of Education Deborah S. Delisle said. “How do we measure the care that a teacher gives when that kid’s parent passes away due to cancer?”
Throughout the event, the panelists offered insight into controversial topics surrounding modern education and the education system’s future.
Audience members represented diverse backgrounds, including visiting professors from other countries, graduate students, and college students.
“[These] kind of events help to identify the change we have to start now to create the educational system you would need in the following decades,” said visiting professor Sergio Cárdenas, who will also be participating in a panel discussion on Friday.
Education School student Danxi Shen praised the “diversity of experiences” she said the panelists brought to the table.
“We have a really different landscape and education reform must follow the trend,” Shen said. “If you want to educate the next generation of leaders, then we need to innovate the way we teach and learn.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
When Jose Sahagun opened the doors of Cancun Taqueria y Mas last October, customers constantly demanded margaritas. But Sahagun was still waiting to obtain a liquor license and, without one, he worried that the new restaurant might fail before it could gain a foothold among Harvard Square businesses.
Other business owners have echoed the same story. They too experienced frustration and delays while they waited to receive a license. Often, the process of obtaining such permits can be long and arduous. Some Massachusetts liquor laws date back to the eighteenth century, and today, there is a myriad of rules surrounding the application process.
Yet despite the high costs and intricacies of applying, business owners are often willing to wait weeks, wading through multiple levels of red tape, to obtain a permit. Many say that liquor licenses often make the difference between sinking or swimming.
GETTING LICENSED 
Restaurant owners who wish to obtain a new license are sometimes forced to wait months while they complete the lengthy application process instituted by the Cambridge License Commission.
For Sahagun, the owner at Cancun Taqueria, the process involved multiple hearings before the Cambridge License Commission. Cancun also had to present a petition with over 1,000 signatures of support and complete a series of exhaustive background checks before its application moved forward.
The whole process took six months total.
“It was a very long, difficult process. Every step along the way was difficult,” Sahagun said. 
Elizabeth Y. Lint, executive director of the Cambridge License Commission, however, noted that the liquor license process stands apart from that of other areas of Massachusetts. According to Lint, Cambridge is one of only two Massachusetts counties that lack a fixed quota for liquor licenses.
Though there is a quota for the number of liquor stores around Harvard Square, no such limit exists for liquor licenses given to restaurants, Lint said. She said she believes that the number of eateries to successfully obtain licenses has increased in recent years, especially due to development in Kendall Square. Meanwhile, the number of Harvard Square restaurants that have received licenses has held relatively steady over the last several years, she said.
Lint estimated that about 263 establishments currently hold liquor licenses throughout Cambridge. According to Denise A. Jillson, the executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, only 48 of those liquor licenses currently belong to restaurants in Harvard Square.
To obtain the coveted license, those restaurants had to undergo a rigorous and costly application process, with most applicants paying an initial $175 “hearing and advertising” fee to set the wheels in motion. They must also pay an additional $200 state fee.
Stores seeking to sell various types of alcohol or remain open at different times receive specific types of license—each with its own fee. 
 Lint outlined the manifold varieties of licenses available and the restrictions that they entail.
“You can have just wine and malt, you can have all alcohol,” Lint said. “There are some that are just breweries, like Cambridge Brewing Company, and then the hours are different, the days of the week might be different.”
According to Lint, the most expensive licenses can cost around $6,000. Restaurants are often willing to pay the extra sum because the more expensive license comes with greater freedom to sell what they want, when they want to.
Lint estimated that the process for issuing a new license could take anywhere from four to ten weeks, depending on whether there are issues with state compliance.
Although owners reported a variety of experiences regarding the licensing application, most noted that obtaining a liquor license can make or break an establishment—particularly in Harvard Square.
CERTIFICATE FOR SURVIVAL
According to Sahagun, when Cancun Taqueria opened its doors in October 2013, it became immediately apparent that a liquor license would be required for the business to turn a profit.
He recounted how customers constantly asked whether the restaurant served trademark Mexican drinks, such as margaritas, before Cancun Taqueria acquired its license.
“It’s very important, especially in the area,” Sahagun said. “People want to have Mexican food with a drink. If we didn't [serve alcohol], they would just not come, and that’s one of the problems we ran into.”
After acquiring a liquor license about a month ago, business at the Taqueria improved dramatically, Sahagun said. 
Many other Cambridge establishment owners offered similar perspectives, highlighting the importance of a liquor license.
Dan B. Hogan, executive director at the folk music venue Club Passim, noted that although he had no difficulty obtaining a special non-profit liquor license, the permit has proved critical to his business. According to Hogan, beer and wine sales account for almost 100 percent of its surplus revenue.
For restaurants, the necessity of a liquor license is even more acute. 
Jen Fields, the general manager at Alden & Harlow, said that it is easier to make money from alcohol sales than from food. She noted that the perishability of food was one reason why alcohol generally produces wider profit margins.
Kari Kuelzer, the co-owner and general manager of Grendel’s Den, also highlighted how restaurants need licenses to make a profit.
“The general rule of thumb is that if they don't serve alcohol, they won't survive,” Kuelzer said. 
MAKING DO WITHOUT
Though liquor licensing can provide a boost to revenue, many businesses still yield a profit without a liquor license.
Felipe’s Taqueria, for example, operated without a license to distribute alcohol at its former Mt. Auburn location for almost a decade.
Yet even that popular vendor has succumbed to the need for a license. The restaurant announced plans to move to a new location and to seek a liquor license last October.
Although the owners have already begun the process of transferring  business to 21 Brattle St., they are unsure when they would receive a license any time soon. According to co-owner Tom Brush, the application process has taken longer than expected. He now plans to open the new location without a license.
Yet Brush said he was unconcerned.
“While we would love to open with a beer and wine license, it’s unlikely that we will,” Brush said. “Felipe’s has always been about the food and we’re not concerned about operating and opening without a liquor license.”
Jillson agreed that a liquor license is sometimes unnecessary and pointed to a wide range of flourishing eateries without licences in Harvard Square.
According to Jillson, some establishments simply do not require alcohol sales to bolster their business model. She also noted that some fast food restaurants, such as Flat Patties and Pinocchio’s, do not offer an environment conducive to serving alcohol. 
Nevertheless, Jillson reaffirmed the importance of a liquor license for restaurants, which offer a more traditional setting.
 
“If their vision includes sitting down and having a nice meal and a glass of wine or cold beer as part of that experience, then yes, [a license] is absolutely critical,” Jillson said.

UPDATED: April 25, 2014 at 11:18 a.m.
Harvard has raised more than $900 million since the public launch of the University’s capital campaign last September, and longtime supporters credit much of the progress to a new generation of alumni donors.
They have also noted that priorities such as financial aid have galvanized donors across a wide range of classes and are responsible for much of the campaign’s success so far.
“There is always a positive response to financial aid endowment, both from people who went to Harvard on scholarship and have become very successful, and from other people who just feel that the cost of education is so enormous and the debt level is so big,” said Peter L. Malkin ’55, a New York real estate mogul and longtime donor to the University.
Ten years after the announcement of the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative, which now ensures that students with family incomes below $65,000 do not pay any tuition or fees, donors insist that keeping the Admissions Office’s coffers full remains a top priority.
“That’s a huge part of what makes Harvard special—how generous it can be,” John F. Savarese ’77, a Law School lecturer who has in the past helped lead fundraising efforts at the professional school, said in an interview this week. “I think that’s something that people care passionately about and want very much to support.”
So far, University leaders have capitalized on the energy around financial aid. In February, Kenneth C. Griffin ’89 gave $150 million to the University, directing $125 million of that money to undergraduate financial aid. The gift was the largest in the history of Harvard College and the largest publicly disclosed gift in the history of the University.
And Griffin, at 45 years old, exemplifies another trend of the campaign. Along with supporters like William A. Ackman ’88 and Karen H. Ackman, an alumna of the Graduate School of Design—who this month gave $17 million to fund human behavioral research—Griffin highlights what donors say is a younger base of support for this fundraising drive.
“Many people in my generation have done some good lifting during our period, and this is the time for Harvard to reach out to the next generation.... These people in their 40s and 50s have come [of age],” said Peter J. Solomon ’60, who has served on the University’s Board of Overseers and Committee on University Resources. 
“[Harvard] may have gotten somewhat lucky because so much money has been made in the last 15 to 20 years...by the younger classes,” Solomon added.
Many of the donors who fueled the University’s last capital campaign—a drive that was led by then-President Neil L. Rudenstine and concluded in 1999 after raising $2.6 billion—have either retired or are reaching retirement age.
“People my age don’t work, and we have some resources, but we’re beyond our peak earning years,” said David B. Watts ’55, a donor who has endowed numerous scholarships at the College. Watts added that, as compensation in some industries has trended upwards, younger alumni may be able to be even more generous than their predecessors.
“They’ll out earn us,” Watts said.

The Harvard men’s volleyball team (15-8, 11-3 EIVA) saw its season come to an end with a loss to Ivy rival Princeton (16-9, 10-4 EIVA) in the EIVA playoffs, held at Penn State.
Although Harvard won both times when these teams met in the regular season, Princeton actually had more total points over the course of the two matchups. When push came to shove in the playoffs, it was the Tigers who came out on top.
“I think that they served pretty great and passed pretty well,” said co-captain Nick Madden of the loss. “We didn’t serve great, could have passed better and could have played looser.”
Coach Brian Baise echoed Madden’s sentiments. He also cited serving and passing as the key influences behind the Princeton win, referencing the difference in confidence between the two sides as another contributing factor.
“The difference between the two teams today was the serving and the passing,” Baise said. “They served very well and we struggled with their serve. They were swinging around, and playing looser and with a lot more confidence.”
That confidence translated into a dominant Tigers’ offensive performance. Its powerful trio of hitters who were named this week to All-EIVA teams, Cody Kessel, Pat Schwagler and Devin Stearns, laid siege to the Crimson defense.
Kessel, a junior, has been Princeton’s best hitter all season and one of the top hitters in the conference. However, he was kept relatively silent with 11 kills at only a .188 clip. However, Stearns and Schwagler were rampant. Schwagler put in game-high performances of 22 and 16 kills against Harvard this season and paced both teams again with 19 kills on the night, at an extremely efficient rate of .471. Stearns too had 17 kills and overall the Princeton’s typically strong offense won out over Harvard’s typically strong defense.
For the game, the Tigers averaged just under 15 kills a game while Harvard reached that threshold just one in four sets. Princeton was also the cleaner team on the night, committing six fewer errors than the Crimson with a hitting percentage of .280 or higher in three of the four sets (compared to just one of four for Harvard).
The Crimson could not get anything going out of the gate on the night. The team was held to an anemic .088 hitting percentage in the first set, with only nine kills and a costly six errors. Under an offensive onslaught from the Tigers, Harvard went down 25-20 in the first, with the result never really in doubt.
Things started to pick up for the Crimson in the second, but the Princeton offense rifled into higher gear. The Tigers came out swinging and jumped out to a 10-3 lead behind strong hitting. Maintaining that lead for the rest of the set, Princeton ran out comfortable 25-15 winners backed by an imperious .483 hitting percentage for the set.
Defense has been part of Harvard’s calling card all season and despite 11 digs from both co-captains Madden and libero Chris Gibbons, Princeton junior libero Tony Ensbury was the defensive difference maker. The junior had a game-high 18 digs, thwarting the Harvard offense all game long. However, just as the game looked close to being over, the Crimson showed some true spirit.
Behind the hitting of Caleb Zimmick and Branden Clemens, Harvard clawed its way back into the match. With the offense flowing, the team was able to squeeze out a close third set 25-22, ending set with five of seven points after being tied at 20. Zimmick, though typically a blocker, led the Crimson with 12 kills off only 19 attempts for the game.
Fighting to keep its season alive, Harvard played a tense fourth game. According to Baise, it really could have gone either way but at the end of the day, the Crimson just failed to capitalize on some of its opportunities.
“We had opportunities, especially in that fourth game,” Baise said. “It was such a competitive match and such a fast game that if you don’t take those opportunities on the first try, you don’t get them back.”
The Tigers ran out as 25-21 winners to clinch the match, ending the match with a fitting Schwagler kill. Princeton will now go on to face Penn State for the EIVA crown in Saturday’s final, while Harvard’s season ended with a loss a game short of where it went the year before.
For some players on the team, it was not just the last game of the season but indeed the last game of their careers. The senior class has seen Harvard volleyball grow into a top EIVA contender, and set program records for conference wins, national rankings and All-EIVA selections this season. For Madden, who led the team to 60 total wins over the course of his four-year career, it was a time well spent.
“I’m really happy with the four years that we’ve played as a senior class here,” Madden said. “We’ve changed the program for the better, we’ve worked really hard, and I’m proud to say I’ve played for the team. I’m looking forward to the tradition of strong volleyball programs continuing over the next couple of years. I haven’t regretted a game I’ve played in the past four years and don’t regret the effort we put out there tonight.”

Nearly a month after ending his career at Harvard in an 80-71 third-round NCAA Tournament loss to Michigan State, co-captain Brandyn Curry has signed with an agent to pursue a professional basketball career.
Curry announced last week that he is signing with Scorers 1st, a sports management company that will work as Curry’s agent.
“We could not be more excited to have the chance to work for and with Brandyn as he makes the transition from college to playing professionally at the next level,” said Scorers 1st CEO Gerrit Kersten-Thiele, an NBA-certified agent.
At Harvard, Curry was part of the first Ivy League outright champions in school history, leading the squad to March Madness in 2012. That year, as a junior, Curry was selected as a candidate for the 2012 Bob Cousy Award, which honors the best point guard in the country, and earned second-team All-Ivy honors.
Curry, who ranks fifth all-time on the school’s assist list with 489 in his career, will join a Sports 1st client list that includes Patrick Ewing Jr. and Ali Farokhmanesh.

Harvard women’s golf has quietly been one of the best teams out of all the 42 Crimson varsity teams. On the six occasions the team has played this season on the East Coast, each time it has come out victorious. Its West Coast performances against some of the best competition in the nation has also seen some extremely respectable finishes–placing sixth in Colorado and eighth in Mississippi.  The consistently high quality of the squad’s performances is even more remarkable given the typically high variance nature of the sport of golf–Tiger didn’t even make the cut at the Masters! 
For these reasons, Harvard will stride into the Baltusrol Golf Club in Springfield, NJ as favorites to three-peat as Ivy Champions.
The Crimson may have won both of the last two Ivy crowns, but it has always been close. Over three rounds of play and four golfers per round (12 rounds in total going into the final score), Harvard was victorious by merely six strokes in 2012 and only one single stroke in 2013. 
Princeton pushed Harvard to the limit last year and will return last season’s individual Ivy champ and honorable mention All-American Kelly Shon. Shon will be looking to close out her senior season with another individual title as she attempts to lead the team to victory.
The other main pretender to the Crimson’s throne is Yale who finished third last season, but have added a star recruit to its mix. Freshman Elisabeth Bernabe had already competed in the 2012 Women’s open before coming to college and shot a ludicrously low 10 under par 62 at El Prado Golf Club this season. This team is on the rise and will certainly be a serious threat to win it all. There certainly exists animosity between the two teams: freshman Julia Yao's bio is a little bit hostile, as she cites her reason for choosing Yale as “because it’s not Harvard”. Watch out for that one.
The Crimson is hardly short of weapons of its own though. Bonnie Hu has long been the backbone of the team, serving her second year as team captain, and the senior will be looking to graduate on a high note. Junior Tiffany Lim holds the record for team low round this season with a 66 and has never been part of a team that didn’t win Ivies.
Sophomore Christine Lin came in as a revelation last season, winning The Crimson’s Female Individual Achievement of the Year for losing against Shon in the championship playoff last season. She will be hoping to repeat that performance this time around.
Remarkably though, for all the upperclassman talent on the team, freshman Anne Cheng leads the Crimson in scoring this season with an average of 74.94. It speaks to the depth of talent on Harvard’s team right now that the other roster members junior Brenna Nelsen, a Crimson sports editor, freshman Nina Fairbairn and sophomore Courtney Hooten have all had top-five finishes this season. In a sport where everyone’s performance matters, it is Harvard’s depth which ultimately singles them out as favorites.
It all comes down to this weekend. One team will leave as champions, and whoever that may be, the only reasonable bet is that it will be close.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
After seeing its 18-game winning streak snapped in a 2-1 loss to Boston University (26-18, 8-4 Patriot League), the Harvard softball team (27-12, 13-0 Ivy) was quick to turn the page. Junior pitcher Laura Ricciardone, who shut out the Terriers in her four innings on the mound, framed the loss in the team’s bigger picture.
“We wanted to use the game as a tune-up game heading into the Dartmouth weekend for our pitchers,” Ricciardone said.
The staff ace was quick to note that she doesn’t anticipate any hangover from the team this weekend in its four-game series against the Big Green, which trails Harvard by just a game in the loss column."
“This won’t affect the team’s play this weekend,” Ricciardone said. “If anything, the team is now more motivated to come out and get the wins against Dartmouth.”
On Thursday, the Terriers held Harvard scoreless for the first six innings of play behind the efforts of Lauren Hynes. Hynes let just three runners reach base on the day, scattering a hit and two walks across six innings of work.
At the plate, the Terriers were able to put two across in the bottom of the fifth inning after freshman Taylor Cabe came in to relieve Ricciardone. Senior Amy Ekart led off the inning with a single for the Terriers, and BU, desperate for offense, subbed in junior Kendra Meadows as a pinch runner. Meadows swiped second and stole third on a double steal two batters later.
When freshman Brittany Youman singled in both runners, the Terriers had its first lead of the contest.
“Today was a bit of a tough day for us,” Harvard junior Emily Gusse said. “We didn’t come out as we should of.”
Down by two runs heading into the final inning, Gusse halved the deficit with a home run down the left-field line for her fourth of the season. That was as close as the Crimson would get, as consecutive groundouts ended the game.
“On the home run, I was trying to get something started and saw a good pitch,” Gusse said. “She served it up for me.”
The junior noted that the team struggled to make adjustments early to Hynes’ pitching. Harvard went three up and three down in both of the first two innings, getting only four base runners in as many innings.
“We got to get things going sooner and make our adjustments a little bit sooner in the game,” Gusse said.
With more important games on the horizon—the pair of weekend doubleheaders with the Big Green could decide the Ivy North Division—Gusse said that the team can learn a lot from the loss.
“It’s a good team mindset to get a little bit humbled,” Gusse said. “We were on a nice win streak but now that’s out of the window and we can take this game for what it is and use it to take us to the Ivy League Championship.”

Listen up, prefrosh! It's Visitas weekend, and while 1,285 of you are probably busy packing and writing heartfelt Facebook statuses about how this weekend will change your life, there are some things you need to know before you touch down in Cambridge. Here are a few tips to help you avoid looking like a prefrosh this weekend.
Ditch the Class ShirtThe lives of college students pretty much depend on giveaways and promotions. Whether it’s water bottles and mugs, t-shirts, or food, we will do pretty much anything for free stuff. So we understand that you were excited to get your free Class of 2018 shirt after you got in. But please leave it at home. There is no need for you to broadcast your class year across your chest. You’ll be so excited and well-rested compared to all of the other students on the Harvard campus that you’ll have no problem picking each other out in a crowd.
Don’t Reveal Yourself as a Facebook StalkerFacebook celebs. Every class has them.  They’ve swamped your notifications for the past few months, and while you really want to hate them, sometimes you find yourself actually liking one of their posts. However, this DOES NOT give you the right to admit that you’ve spent hours Facebook stalking them. When you meet them, don’t say “Hey! I know you from Facebook!” It’s mildly creepy and suggests that you spend just as much time online as they do. Kindly ask them what their name is and where they’re from, even if you already know the answer. The same goes for Twitter, Instagram, and all other social media.
 
Don’t Say “Hahvahd”This one applies to everyone, not just prefrosh. Having grown up in Boston, there is nothing worse than hearing non-locals say—or try to say—“Hahvahd Yahd.” You may think you’ve perfected your Boston accent, but you’re very wrong. The accent is an art, and even the most experienced actors have trouble with it. So please remember to pronounce your R’s, and don’t you dare call it “Bean Town.”

 Happy Friday! You’ve made it to the weekend, and as we all know it’s not just any weekend—it’s Visitas! Whether you’re excited for a prefrosh-filled weekend or not, here’s Flyby’s guide to handling Visitas:
For the prefrosh who keeps asking you what he/she should bring for this weekend: Yes, you should probably bring shower flip flops. No, you should probably not bring that massive list of other prestigious colleges you got into and can’t decide between.
If you don’t want your prefrosh to be a social embarrassment while he/she follows you around this weekend: Just think of the uncomfortable period of silence that’ll ensue after your prefrosh tells your friends in conversation that they’re going to an event in “C.G.I.S.” instead of “See-jiss.” Awkward.
If your prefrosh is live-tweeting his/her weekend on the 2018 Facebook page: They might as well read up on the proper way to achieve Facebook stardom. And just incase they need examples of success stories, tell them to read about the Class of 2017 Facebook celebrities.
If you get a really annoying prefrosh: Tell them that the fact that the toaster at Annenberg is at least 15 steps away from the bread is seriously making you consider transferring to another school.
And if your prefrosh is Kwasi Enin: We wrote an open letter to you—yes, that’s how much we want you here.
 IN THE ATMOSPHEREWe’re in for fairly mediocre weather this weekend! It’ll be sunny and a high of 63 degrees during the day on Friday, but there’s a high chance of rain at night. It’ll be rainy all of Saturday and mostly cloudy on Sunday. Well, at least the prefrosh will get an accurate sense of the weather here.
