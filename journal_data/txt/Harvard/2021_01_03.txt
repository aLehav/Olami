After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Most artists can’t say that they secured a feature from Beyoncé or Nicki Minaj before their debut album. Most artists can’t point to six platinum and five gold records before their debut album. Most artists can’t claim two Billboard number one singles before their debut album. Megan Thee Stallion is not “most artists.” With the incredible success that the Houston-based rapper has already attained, it is hard to imagine how she could possibly top her previous critically acclaimed EPs and mixtapes. Yet somehow, Megan Thee Stallion’s debut album “Good News,” released on Nov. 20, does just that.
“Good News” starts with the diss track “Shots Fired,” a song that puts all other recent diss tracks to shame. On this opener, Megan wastes no time addressing the controversy surrounding her and rapper Tory Lanez, who allegedly shot her after an argument on July 12. Megan not only acknowledges the shooting, but she also unloads on Lanez — humiliating him and his supporters with lines such as “A pussy n**** with a pussy gun in his feelings” and “Any n**** on that n****’s side is a clout chaser (Fuck y’all) / A bitch who he fuckin’ or a ho that he payin’.” Megan takes her song a step further by acknowledging how her shooting is part of a trend of Black women’s pain not being taking seriously in this country with the lines “Now here we are, 2020, eight months later / And we still ain't got no fuckin' justice for Breonna Taylor (Breonna Taylor).” Although “Shots Fired” is a diss track and specific to Megan’s situation with Lanez, Black women everywhere can feel empowered hearing this song and seeing Megan stand up for herself in such a powerful and clever way.
After essentially shutting down Lanez and his supporters on “Shots Fired,” Megan spends the rest of “Good News” building herself and all other “hot girls” up. Tracks such as “Circles” and “Sugar Baby” showcase the Megan that fans know and love: Thee Hot Girl who makes songs about having the sex she wants, being rich, making men buy her material goods, and not paying any mind to the haters or admirers who don’t meet her (rightfully) high standards. Standout tracks “Freaky Girls (feat. SZA)” and “Body” are flirty, freaky, upbeat, and danceable — perfect for those who love to twerk along with Megan. “What’s New,” “Work That,” and “Girls in the Hood” — the album’s first single — don’t rely on theatrics as they showcase Megan’s incredible lyricism and flow.
Another incredible element of “Good News” is its wide variety of features. SZA, City Girls, Big Sean, 2 Chainz, DaBaby, Young Thug, Lil Durk, Popcaan, Mustard, and, the queen herself, Beyoncé all make appearances. Typically, this many features would be distracting. Megan Thee Stallion, however, has proven time and time again she is not like other artists. On each song that features equally or more popular musicians, Megan holds her own. Never once does Megan feel overshadowed by those she features on her album, and never once do those artists feel overshadowed by Megan. Megan gives everyone their time to shine, but never lets anyone outshine her.
“Good News” even finds Megan going outside of her comfort zone with songs like “Intercourse (feat. Popcaan & Mustard)” and “Don’t Rock Me to Sleep.” The former is a dancehall-inspired song in which Popcaan, a well-known Jamaican dancehall singer, sings about sex with a desirable woman and Megan raps over a slow dancehall beat, with verses about her body and sex that make reference to Jamaica. “Intercourse (feat. Popcaan & Mustard)” is very different from Megan’s other works. Never before has the artist featured dancehall artists or influences in her music; however, the subject matter and Megan’s undeniable flow connects the song to the rest of the album.
The latter track, “Don’t Rock Me to Sleep,” is an unusual addition to Megan’s discography. “Don’t Rock Me to Sleep” is a sing-songy pop track — something that strays away from fans’ expectations even more than “Intercourse (feat. Popcaan & Mustard).” Unfortunately, the risk that Megan takes with this song does not pay off as well as the ones she has taken in the past. While “Don’t Rock Me to Sleep” is not a particularly bad song, it is reminiscent of the types of tracks that are played over the stereos of stores like Forever 21 and American Eagle Outfitters — not at all what people go to Megan’s discography for. Sandwiched between “Go Crazy (feat. Big Sean & 2 Chainz)” and “Outside,” two songs that are very Megan Thee Stallion, “Don’t Rock Me to Sleep” feels out of place on this album — it probably would have fared better as a standalone single.
With the exception of  “Intercourse (feat. Popcaan & Mustard) and “Don’t Rock Me to Sleep,” “Good News” does not stray too far from Megan Thee Stallion’s past works. The album has songs about money and sex, beats by Lil Ju, explicit yet clever lyrics, and, of course, a DaBaby feature (among its many other cameos). In fact, the album is notably similar to Megan Thee Stallion’s mixtapes and EPs such as “Tina Snow” and “Fever,” but that’s what makes it so good. Through the seventeen tracks on this LP, Megan Thee Stallion shows all other new artists how a debut album should be done. Fans of Megan Thee Stallion know that her music is a guaranteed pick-me-up, and in a year when everything feels like it’s falling apart, we could all use some “Good News.”

With the Michael Jackson sample swimming in the back, Busta rhyming like it’s the golden ‘90s, and Kendrick Lamar spitting bars in an ode to classic hip hop, the message is clear — “Look Over Your Shoulder” is a classic masterpiece.
Nothing gets you grooving like a classic Jackson 5 track. The nostalgia hits different when the chorus of “I’ll Be There” opens up the song, with young Michael belting away “just look over your shoulders, honey.” The mellow piano chords and serenading vocals harmonize with the bass-heavy beat, a combination highly reminiscent of great ‘90s hits. As a result, the track flows like honey, comforting the listener and giving them the opportunity to reminisce.
Listeners get lucky; the song’s lyrics are even smoother than its beat. “My folks unite soon as the flow get nice,” raps Kendrick, speaking on the universality of music and how it should bring people together rather than tear them apart. The message is clear: In a time of division, music is the solution. “When they fuck you over it’s love” preaches the Compton artist, and the tough love of the rap industry becomes justified for the cause of making progress through the music.
Kendrick may be the featured artist, but it becomes clear that this collaboration was a united effort when he passes the mic to Busta.
“The Buddha, the Ali Baba, the believer-er maker” comes in hard and fast, rightfully claiming his mark on the rap scene. The man, the myth, the legend himself has conquered the industry “till the point niggas scared to rap with me.” Busta acknowledges that even though “the game is a little different” now, he’s still able to keep everyone in check and paying attention to his fast-paced rhythm and classic flow.
The theme of growth through adversity also carries flawlessly over to Busta’s verse.
“Upholding the fundamentals ... focus on what's most essential, spit bars to provoke your mental,” Busta delivers verse after verse of pure heat. The rapper reminds listeners of his priorities when it comes to rapping too, showing the listener how he “kept burnin' 'til they anointed me one of the kings of Black history.” That call to action through personal success is precisely what cemented Busta in rap’s hall of fame alongside King Kunta, and what crowned MJ as the king of pop. The one complication to the song’s nostalgia for the king of pop, however, is the series of serious sexual abuse allegations made against him. But the late singer is not profiting from the use of his samples — so the nod to the singer’s musical impact seems less of a cameo and more of an enhancement to the song’s sound.
All in all, the beat selection, the lyricality, the message: Gold. In a triumvirate few could have foreseen, the musical impact of this collaboration is sure to have the industry looking over their shoulders for years.

Even the world’s most successful boy band can’t elude COVID-19. The global sensation that is BTS — known for flashy dances, their Twitter famous fanbase “ARMY,” and sold-out stadiums across the world — is now, like everyone else, stuck at home.
The septet’s fifth Korean-language studio album “BE” (2020) encapsulates the contemplation and emotional maturity that have characterized the growth many have gone through over the past several months. While previous discography relied heavily on dramatic binaries of dark and light, “BE” settles for a nuanced medium; at long last, the band seems comfortable releasing songs that don’t dazzle at first listen, but rather take on greater lyrical depth with time. In these tracks, the septet sounds more reserved than usual, more self-assured. Perhaps they’re just growing up.
BTS, however, was not always so deft at probing the complex dance between outward success and inner turbulence. To understand the band’s complicated relationship with fame, one must place “BE” in relation to their prior efforts. In previous albums, deep-seated anxieties about failure and change presented themselves either subtly through shimmery pop — think “HOME” and “1, 2, 3!” — or through brooding tunes like “Black Swan,” “Interlude: Shadow,” and “UGH!” The septet’s approach to vulnerability, in other words, came across as either concealed or melodramatic.
The unfiltered fears expressed in “BE” are a refreshing departure from this pattern. “Skit,” for instance, isn’t even a song; it’s simply a seven-way conversation filled with censored swears, self-deprecation, and a healthy dose of J-Hope’s maniacal laughter — chart-topping idols regress into chaotic roommates. “Dis-ease” is upfront about the group’s growing dependence on external validation. “I’m hungry for achievements every day,” J-Hope laments. “It’s unsafe, this is a disease.” RM also muses, “Whatever label is attached to me after this time / I hope that’s all you / You, you, you.” The song’s verses underscore the band’s anxiety about being hyper-commercialized, a phenomenon that is perhaps inevitable given their now-global fame.
“BE” is at its best and most interesting when the idols deftly balance their vision for the future with introspective nostalgia. The retro-funk gem “Telepathy” has optimistic yet gently melancholic lyrics that yearn for simpler times. “Now let’s go to the blue sea / The blue sea we used to play with,” J-Hope croons. Jungkook reassures fans with the comforting lines, “Even if I’m not by your side, yeah / You know we’re together.” Refreshing in its bold percussives and stripped chorus, “Fly To My Room” meditates on the capacity for adventure despite physical confinement. Jimin and V’s lines “Get me outta my blues / And now I’m feelin’ brand new” reflect wistfully on the desire for reinvention during the era of COVID-19. “Life Goes On,” the album’s lead track, provides a soothing if somewhat packaged affirmation that everything will turn out alright, while the all-English song “Dynamite” — though conventional in its plastic exuberance — boasts an addicting chorus.
Other songs conform to patterns of dark and light prevalent in the band’s previous discography. The excessively melodramatic lyrics of “Blue & Grey” detract from the somber gloom of the ballad’s unadorned instrumentals. At one point in the song, Jungkook bemoans, “I guess everyone’s happy / Can you look at me? ‘Cause I’m blue and grey.” Similarly, the EDM-influenced “Stay” combines garish synth pop with a hackneyed SOS to fans reminiscent of “Mikrokosmos” and “Magic Shop.”
Critics of BTS have long pointed to their recycled, shiny beats as subpar, expected, and — the cultural favorite — woefully “mainstream.” The subversion of this caricature in “BE” is timely and welcome. The group’s fifth studio album reflects a steady lyrical maturation: The band isn’t simply growing up — they’re growing on their own terms, reimagining the ways they want to be celebrated and remembered. At last, Jungkook, Jimin, V, RM, J-Hope, Suga, and Jin use music to reach out not only to the world, but also to themselves.

This past month, Lil Uzi Vert and Future released their long-awaited collaborative album “Pluto x Baby Pluto,” delivering endless chemistry and straightforward thrills. While the album as a whole is a success, Future’s failure to innovate on his signature style leaves quite a bit to be desired.
Future is a veteran of the joint album. In the past five years, the rapper has released projects with Gucci Mane, Young Thug, and Drake. A Future-Uzi collab album has been in the works for some time. Separated by a ten-year age gap, the junior Uzi has been vocal about Future’s influence on his music. Uzi’s “Baby Pluto” alter ego is inspired by Future’s 2012 debut album, “Pluto.” This year, the duo has churned out a steady run of team-ups. In March, Future featured on the deluxe version of Uzi’s album “Eternal Atake.” In May, Uzi appeared on Future’s eight album, “High on Life.” And in August, the rappers released a pair of singles. “Pluto x Baby Pluto” is the highly-anticipated first full-length collaboration from the “Pluto” rappers.
On the album, the pair are solidly supported by straightforward production that forsakes artistic growth in the name of fun. The best beats on the project come from known hit-makers Zaytoven, London on da Track, and veteran executive producer DJ ESCO. The opening track “Stripes Like Burberry” is a fitting introduction, nicely cradling Uzi and Future’s melodic delivery in a landscape of synths, high hats, and bass. The production is consistently high quality, but it doesn’t break any new ground. The album lacks the overall cohesion and experimentation that made Uzi’s “Eternal Atake” such a success. It is equivalent to a really great playlist — a project that can be played just as well on shuffle as in order. Nevertheless, the excitement of hearing Future and Uzi together is enough to forgive most of the missed opportunities.
First and foremost, the album is a showcase of Future and Uzi’s stellar musical chemistry. The rappers feed off each other’s energy, throwing verses back and forth with infectious confidence. On the chorus to “Plastic,” Future passes the song off to Uzi, “Yeah, late for church / Yeah, switch your purse / Yeah, swap to Vert.” Uzi matches Future’s cool flow, “Yeah, gettin’ them racks / Yeah, spendin them racks / Yeah, makin’ it back.” The duo’s effortless bar for bar delivery makes the song one of the best on the album. The track, “That’s It,” features similar thrills with Uzi and Future rotating hook duty.
However, for much of the project, Uzi outshines Future; the student has surpassed the teacher. Future’s main problem is his lack of versatility, utilizing a similar flow and cadence on a majority of the tracks. Perhaps a result of the rapper’s lengthy career, very few of the songs on the album stand out as unique among his discography.
In contrast, Uzi displays an impressive toolkit that keeps his outings diverse and exciting. On “Million Dollar Play,” Uzi experiments with a rapid delivery that gives the track a rhythmic drive unfamiliar to his previous work: “I got a lot whole lot of bands in my pants, they from France / My girl from Chicago, she said she don't like rappers.” The song features an entirely new flow from Uzi and contains his strongest verse on the project. Uzi also leaves room for his signature melodic sound. On “I Don’t Wanna Break Up,” he breaks out the pipes, achieving a similar catchiness to his emo-inspired 2017 mega-hit “XO TOUR Llif3.” Uzi’s stylistic dynamism continually pushes the album forward and accounts for Future’s sleepiness.
“Pluto x Baby Pluto” mostly lives up to the hype, delivering a number of very high quality tracks that have the potential to do big numbers. Even with its flaws, the album is a landmark achievement in rap, with Uzi at the arguable peak of his career and the veteran Future still able to produce hits. The album is another trophy on Future’s wall of joint projects, and another rocket boost to the career of Lil Uzi Vert.

The new single from North Hampton rapper Slowthai, “nhs,” showcases his maturation as an artist and pays a moving tribute to the UK National Health Service.
The track is the second promotional single off his upcoming album, “Tyron,” which is set to release in February 2021. The project is the follow up to his 2019 studio debut “Nothing Great About Britain,” and it sports an impressive tracklist, including features from first time Slowthai collaborators A$AP Rocky, Deb Never, and Dominic Fike. In September, Slowthai released the first single off the album, “feel away,” with help from acclaimed British electronic artists James Blake and Mount Kimbie, a departure from the bangers that defined much of “Nothing Great About Britain.” As a follow up, “nhs” continues the mellow trend of “feel away,” perhaps signalling a new era for Slowthai.
Producer Kwes Darko wears his James Blake inspiration on his sleeve. Darko, who made multiple contributions to “Nothing Great About Britain,” ditches the string instrument loops used in his earlier work with Slowthai in favor of spacey, James Blake-inspired pedal tones. Darko’s layering and drum structure takes melodic cues from Blake’s 2011 self-titled debut album. The song also employs the rolling harmonies explored by Darko on tracks like “Gorgeous” and “Ladies” off of Slowthai’s debut, resulting in a rhythmic warmth similar to that of “feel away.”
Yet the track achieves much more than simple James Blake cosplay, thanks to Slowthai’s melodic and smooth delivery. The rapper is battle-tested when it comes to flowing over aggressive beats — releasing a run of hard-edged singles over the summer, including one with current hip-hop it-man Kenny Beats. As a result, “nhs” represents a pivot for Slowthai, away from his signature upbeat sound towards a softer, more intimate narrative. Like “feel away,” the track is another entry that nicely diversifies the rapper’s discography.
Slowthai transitions to a fresh lyrical approach, one that allows him to explore his emotions and express his gratitude. On the track, Slowthai takes an inward look at his emotions, a rare occurrence within his catalogue: “My demons pry feelings, die dreaming / No glass ceiling, try peelin' back layers to find meaning.” In the song’s accompanying music video, Slowthai stands on a tower of toilet paper, a reference to the hoarding that took place at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Midway through the track, he dedicates the song to the UK National Health Service: “NHS, this one's for the NHS.” There have been only a few songs written about the coronavirus pandemic, and even fewer thanking health care workers. Slowthai’s singing on the hook and effortless flow heighten the sincerity of his words.
The North Hampton rapper is in the midst of a rebrand from rabble-rouser to well-rounded artist. Up to this point in his career, Slowthai’s public persona has been unfiltered and divisive, which equally earned him fans as it drove others away. At the 2019 Hyundai Mercury Prize hosted by the BBC, the rapper went viral for walking onto the stage with a prosthetic of Boris Johnson’s severed head, yelling “Fuck Boris.” Slowthai had a similarly controversial experience at the 2020 NME awards, drunkenly accepting his “Hero of the Year'' award and attempting to make a pass at presenter Katherine Ryan. Following the incident, Twitter users moved to “cancel” the rapper. In the months since the incident, Slowthai has apologized to Ryan and NME on multiple occasions, calling Ryan, “the true hero of the year,” on Twitter. Ryan has also expressed that she was not made uncomfortable by the altercation.
Slowthai’s latest music seems to suggest that he’s turned a new leaf, with less focus on rage and more attention to growth

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Jan. 5, 2021, 12:33 p.m.
Artists Bladee and Mechatok, both known for their colorful and cryptic social media aesthetics, appear unnatural sitting in the beige, monochromatic room they’re calling from. The room and their outfits — black sweatshirts for both and, for Mechatok, a black New York Yankees cap — are antithetical to the image the pair have crafted for themselves through their music and online presence. The casual groutfits were a stark departure from their established aesthetic, saturated with bright colors and glowing figures to complement their hyper-produced pop songs.
Video-calling in from their label YEAR0001’s office in Stockholm, Sweden, the 26-year old Swedish rap icon — known by his fans as an “autotune angel” — and the 23-year old German producer sat down with The Harvard Crimson to talk about their latest album, “Good Luck,” and what it’s like to create collaboratively when the world is on pause.
That same contrast between the room and their outfits is evident in how they interact. Bladee, the blueprint “soft boy,” is vague and laconic in his descriptions of the music and process behind it, while Mechatok serves almost as his translator, taking Bladee’s responses and adding to them with examples and imagery. Almost two years of partnership has clearly molded a synergetic duo.
In “Good Luck,” too, contrast leads the way. Throughout the album, the duo blend expansive, ethereal tracks like “Intro” and “Grace'' with infectious dance beats like “God” and “Sun,” providing listeners with a wide array of musical soundscapes to experience. Escapist lyrics about spirituality and the ennui of the everyday clash with bright, saturated production — just as their everyday outfits clash with the extraordinary image the artists have crafted for themselves online.
Bladee, whose real name is Benjamin Reichwald, has been a growing figure in the cloud rap and pop genres, along with fellow Swedish rappers Yung Lean and Ecco2k, since he released his first album in 2016.
Mechatok, real name Timur Tokdemir, hails from Munich, Germany, where he lived before moving to Berlin and immersing himself as a producer in the city’s extensive club culture. Classically trained in the guitar until the age of 18, Tokdemir has since cut his teeth producing house, rap, and pop music.
In considering his roots in classical music and the effect they have had on his music today, he said, “There's something very pure about... transcriptions for guitar. [They] have this thing to them that like you kind of have to merge in the chords, the melody and everything into these six strings…. So there's something about this compactness and sort of like deep emotionality of that, that sort of trickled down into the productions I do.”
Many of the album’s eight songs sound radically different from one another, in part because of Reichwald and Tokdemir’s diverse musical backgrounds. It is that striking dialectic that drives the album forward. While still advancing the musical traditions that each artist is known for — Reichwald with his cryptic lyrics and signature autotune, Tokdemir with his melody-driven mixes — “Good Luck” stands out against the catalog of both artists as a sign of growth from the experience of collaboration.
“That's... part of why we worked together,... because it's like, kind of a different sound from what I would normally do,” Reichwald said before later adding, “I don't maybe think as much of the process and these aspects of what a song is.”
“That's probably one of the biggest things I've learned from this collaboration,” Tokdemir added. “Benjamin had this sort of thing, where [writing] is this sort of stream of consciousness that you then curate afterwards, which makes the results seem much more effortless and kind of as if it was spawned out of nowhere, rather than feeling like this almost forced and super worked thing that maybe lacks a bit of emotionality sometimes.”
For the pair, these differences meant that “Good Luck” required a good deal of experimentation. Though Tokdemir has worked with Drain Gang in the past, contributing to the collective’s 2019 album “Trash Island,” and with Reichwald specifically on the 2019 single “All I Want,” “Good Luck” is the first time the pair has collaborated so extensively. For the creatively diverse duo, the creation of the album was a slow and deliberate process of combining influences and practices. At its core, it involved adding and removing instruments and layers of track until the final product sounded specific enough to get the point across but stripped down enough so that it exists as an essence of the thing.
“The actual making of the song is very intuitive. We just made it in one go pretty much and then we would do this kind of exercise where we, by listening to it, try to decide, ‘What's the best form?’” Reichwald said of their creative process. “Then we'd have the original vein of something that just kind of came to us without contemplating.”
“It's a lot about reduction,” Tokdemir added. “Which is funny because... in some songs that then means the most essential version of it is something that's very dancey and has a kick drum and like, you know, you can play it in the club or whatever. For some other concepts, it resulted in it just being the most stripped down ambient thing, because that was enough for this emotion to be conveyed.”
The last song on the album, “Grace,” for example, is almost entirely constructed by sampling a single sound: the bell that comes on in airplanes when the seatbelt sign goes off. The sense of anxiety that comes from that singular sound — and from the various distortions of it that Tokdemir creates — is enough to drive home the idea presented in Reichwald’s lyrics: “Come down with grace.”
Still, the pairing — while finding strength in its contrast — was not wholly unexpected. The two artists operate mainly in overlapping circles, and recently, Reichwald had spent much of this past year living in Berlin, leading to the perfect opportunity for in-person collaboration, even amid a growing pandemic.
Beyond circumstance, the two artists also share a similar ear for music and taste for strong hooks and melodies that primed them for a fruitful collaboration.
“We definitely feel like we would have made this project or something that sounded like this at one point, anyway, because we both have been really into exploring these kinds of songs,” Reichwald said.
“I guess when I was playing one of my lead melodies or whatever,... I realized that they're like, essentially using the same notes that [Reichwald’s] vocal melodies use. It's like pentatonic scales and these sort of quiet, ethereal seeming, super catchy, very reduced melodies that you can kind of loop into infinity,” Tokdemir added, citing that it was then that it struck him that whatever he did with Reichwald would work really well.
From first listen, the album presents itself as a worthy addition to any club scene — a sense only aided by the fantastical, escapist lyrics of glittering tracks like “Rainbow” (“Take the rainbow road / Put the world on hold / For a moment”).
“When we had just started making these songs, we were just pretty excited about performing it,” Reichwald said. “This record is more visceral,” Tokdemir agreed, adding that it was the type of music people want to dance to.
Due to the restrictions on gatherings brought on by the pandemic, however, the possibility to premiere the new tracks as they beg to be premiered — to a swarm of dancing people in a dark, crowded room — was lost to Reichwald and Tokdemir.
Therein lies the final contrast that defines “Good Luck” — at least for the current moment.
“We [still] wanted to do something that's actually like a real event so that it feels like this happened,” said Reichwald. “Because otherwise, we would just release the album [and] it would be some numbers online.”
The livestream concert to launch the album, dubbed “YEAR0001's bladee & Mechatok’s Extreme Good luck frequency #9DExperience Attract good luck TODAY!!! Unexpected rewards (It Really Works)” took place on December 10.
The show featured the pair in their (digital) element, as Tokdemir guided the audience through seamless transitions in his DJing and Reichwald slouched around the stage in a long fur coat and dark sunglasses.
“Bladee looks like he walked out of the matrix,” one fan wrote in the live event’s chat.
While the show proved a memorable way to cement the album’s arrival provided the circumstance, the virtual experience of watching the pair light up a screen was a far cry from the visceral reality of a concert or club space. Towards the beginning of the performance, the act of experiencing the club-ready music paired with the two-dimensional, digital space felt like watching a fish out of water. The show’s colorful and dynamic visuals, impressively projected across the entire room the duo performed in, fell flat when viewed through a laptop screen.
Reichwald and Tokdemir performed as they would for any show, with Tokdemir anchored to a neon-accented soundboard and Reichwald promenading unbothered across the stage as he sang, but it was obvious that the infectious energy that comes from an in-person audience was lacking.
As the show progressed, however, the effortlessly danceable tracks like “God” and “Into One” took over. Even sitting on a desk chair watching the show, it was impossible not to want to move to their saccharine beats.
The chat function of the livestream, too, became perpetually flooded with fans’ comments, creating a virtual surrogate for the community-driven concert experience. By the time the duo had reached their last song, “Grace,” the energy in the chat was palpable — creating the exact environment and point of catharsis for the album that Reichwald and Tokdemir had envisioned. Even after the screen went black and the two walked off the virtual stage, the chat remained active for the next 10 minutes, flooded with messages from Drainers and cementing “Good Luck”’s standing as an album that was able to transcend the immediate circumstance of the pandemic, just as Reichwald and Tokdemir were able to when writing it.
In terms of what’s next for the artists, the most they could say was that there’s a lot to come. “It’s hard to specify but definitely a lot of stuff,” Tokdemir said.
“[We] can’t stop working,” Reichwald added. “I think next year will be fun and great for music for both of us.”

To return is a strange feeling; to unexpectedly return still stranger. Even as we cordon off chapters of our lives, endings are never quite as tidy as we make them out to be. Ungainly are these homecomings — the holiday breaks, the high school reunions, the sudden quarantines in haunts we convinced ourselves we had left for good — and these places watch us with the same fresh eyes we turn on them. In Taylor Swift’s surprise tweet announcement of her ninth studio album “evermore,” she confesses that penning its companion record “folklore” felt like a return of its own, and once it was finished, she and her collaborators couldn’t help but wander deeper. The result is an album replete with familiarity, startling in its occasional departures, and at times forgivably overwrought (the way these trips so often are). For Swift, known for distinct shifts from album cycle to cycle, the project offers a unique opportunity to find new truths in the spaces we take for granted.
Whereas “folklore” whistles through canopies, “evermore” is rooted in soft earth. The production is lush in a way its predecessor never achieved. Hear it in the loamy guitars of “‘tis the damn season” staging a scene about truck tires caked with mid-January mud, their twang giving just the right amount of reverb for an old flame rekindled out of convenience. It’s there in the loose half scales of the album’s title track too, cascading like melted snowpack over mossy rocks before collecting in pools of Bon Iver’s vernal promises. Sonically, the album has no reservations about meandering, cultivating “1989”-era synth arena pop on “long story short,” mischievous harmonica on “no body, no crime,” and gentle piano melancholy on “champagne problems.” Swift muses in “ivy” about the feeling of “putting roots in my dreamland,” and indeed it feels as if each instrumental sapling, deserving or not, has space to grow in her lightly-tended genrescape.
Perhaps this roomy generosity is necessary to explore the central theme of the album, memory. Throughout “evermore,” Swift takes on the difficult charge of remembrance with the close eye of an archivist. At times, these are customary locales of love lost: She sings of flannel cures in college dorms amid microbrews and candle smoke, of words shared and never forgotten under bleachers. Other stories are less conventional. The murder ballad “no body, no crime,” avenges a fictional Este Haim who is killed by a cheating husband, swapping out the fictive love triangles of “folklore” for three-actor scenes just as unfaithful, but a good bit darker in denouement. Centerpiece of the album “marjorie” tributes the memory of Swift’s grandmother, bringing new significance to the virtue and autumnal wonder well-alive throughout the rest of Swift’s oeuvre. Great attention has been afforded to Swift the storyteller and the idea that, tired of scrutinized articles on her own life, she has found renewed meaning in narratives that are not her own. But this characterization doesn’t quite get it right. The boundary between self and story is neither clear nor stable, in large part because the faces we put forward erode with time, vulnerable to abstraction as we grow and change and return. “evermore” maintains our experiences are borrowed in more ways than we realize, that beauty comes in consecutive waves of recognition and resonance.
Like any bona fide oral history, “evermore” occasionally loses itself in its detours. The strongest parts of the album revisit past successes, recombining tested elements of her songwriting in new ways. Track five “tolerate it” quilts the lyrical bridge structure of “death by a thousand cuts,” the stark double-note melodies of “cardigan,” and short melodic motifs from “this is me trying” to create a chimera earworm even as it ostensibly skirts easy pop trappings. The misses occur when she strays too far from the marked trail. The clanging introduction of “closure” is so discordant as to distract from its meaning; the unorthodox, hook-less digression “cowboy like me” doesn’t make much of its experimentation with form, a swindling deserving of its chief protagonists. Contrary to the promises of “willow,” not every bait-and-switch is a work of art, though the intention behind this toying is to be commended and the license to change things up well-earned.
If the strongest character studies are reminders of self, then the ultimate appeal of “evermore” is that it is intimately handmade. Her opener “willow” channels the homey hyper-specificity of her previous record’s “invisible string,” its sprawling romance spooled out from pluck after pluck of Swift’s fingertips. Echoes of this sound resurface in the atmospheric “coney island,” each knuckle coming together as she tells of closing her fist and shattering her lover. The same palms which lovingly heat freezing embraces and polish plates with no appreciation seem at times defiantly balled, both holding back the bite of the cold and bracing to prove something. Even as Swift laments, “what must it be like to grow up that beautiful,” she seems to understand charm can be crafted with trained digits and sheer will.
With artists like Swift, what typically draws attention are sudden departures — the style-bending, the era-building. Less appreciated is the skill it takes to retread familiar ground. But return is an active process — iterative and revisionary. It compels us to rethink the paths we’ve taken and to rethink ourselves as takers. On “evermore,” Swift returns to boxes we’ve tucked out of sight in the cellars of our imaginations: boxes we did away with because they held things we told ourselves no longer fit in our lives, or because we didn’t have the heart to keep trying. She runs a finger along the dust collecting there, and when she holds it to the light, it twinkles.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After making a splash with the release of her first single last year, Congolese-Belgian artist Lous and The Yakuza solidified her rising star on her debut album, ‘Gore.’ For a new artist, the debut album represents an opportunity and a risk, and outcomes can vary from widely successful to unfortunately disappointing. Lous and The Yakuza did not disappoint – she showcased her talent, made a statement, and left listeners yearning for more. Between the sophisticated and unapologetic themes of her music, the danceable rhythms, and her effortlessly wide-ranging vocal skills, this album is resonant and enjoyable regardless of a listener’s proficiency in French. On “Gore,” Lous cements her role in the music scene, foreshadows the impact of her presence, and creates anticipation for any music of hers that may follow.
The arc of the album is carefully planned, opening and closing with the two singles, “Dilemme” and “Solo,” that skyrocketed Lous and The Yakuza into the public eye. Within the first few tracks, she showcases a multiplicity of vocal skills, from sophisticated harmonies on “Dilemme,” to effortless flow on “Bon acteur,” to breathy, sustained lines on “Téléphone sonne.” Each track has a unique and distinctive sound, but retains elements that make it unmistakably her music: Lous’s smooth and cool voice, driving rhythms and bass lines, sassy lyrics with a sprinkling of lines in English and Spanish, and unapologetic Blackness.
Lous captures the experience of many young adults today, touching on themes loneliness, sexuality, and race as her lyrics provide a glimpse into her life. Without delving into her specific trajectory, Lous’ background before entering the music scene is unique. Her perspective gives her work an intangible distinctiveness. With nuggets of wisdom in lines like “Pourquoi le noir n'est-il pas une couleur de l'arc-en-ciel?” / “Why isn’t black a color in the rainbow?” or “Si je pouvais je vivrais seule” / “If I could I would live alone,” Lous provokes thought while showing listeners who she is and how she sees the world. The queer subtext in parts of the album is similarly pleasing.
The brilliance of Lous and The Yakuza’s album is tenfold, but it is especially remarkable how her music transcends conventional categorization of genre. In one fell swoop, Lous’s music incorporates the electronic bounciness of today’s pop music and the rhythmic ingenuity of excellent R&B. Until 2018, when she signed with Columbia Records, Lous and The Yakuza was an indie artist. Songs like “Quatre heures du matin” and “Courant d’air” are saucy ballads, and in a significant departure, songs like “Messes basses” and “Tout est gore” are metallically sultry. None is more enjoyable than another; no genre features more prominently than another. Her unassuming versatility is made clear, and her album stands out as a result. Perhaps understandably for a new artist, only half of the album’s ten songs had not been released over the past year. The only fathomable critique of ‘Gore’ is that there weren’t more new songs and that the songs weren’t longer.
Lous and The Yakuza’s album leaves no doubt that her influence will only grow from here. ‘Gore’ gives listeners a meditation on contemporary young adulthood, while flirting with various musical genres and styles. The result is refreshing and may well steer popular music toward more versatility, creativity, and authenticity.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As long as the genre has existed, rock n’ roll has been powered by women — this much is no secret. From Sister Rosetta Tharpe, the queer Black trailblazer who became rightfully known as the “godmother of rock n’ roll" for her sensational guitar solos and powerful voice, to Patti Smith, the “punk poet laureate” who was instrumental in the creation of punk as both a culture and a genre — rock n’ roll women have been breaking the boundaries of what is accepted and celebrated in the genre.
Now, for the first time ever, all of the nominees for the Grammy Awards’ best rock performance category are women or female-fronted bands: Fiona Apple, Phoebe Bridgers, Haim, Grace Potter, Brittany Howard, and the band Big Thief (lead by Adrianne Lenker).
For decades, the Grammys have been criticized for paying attention only to white men across genres. It’s no surprise, then, that the all-women slate of nominees has stirred up considerable buzz — especially a year after former head of the Recording Academy Deborah Dugan released a scorching claim against the Grammys fordiscrimination after they fired her, asserting that the “gender gap at the Grammy Awards is real.” Indeed, from 2013 to 2018, only 9.3 percent of the nominees in the five major Grammy Awards categories were women.
In a genre as outwardly male-dominated and exclusive as rock, the gender gap is only more prevalent. A female-fronted group hasn’t won in the Best Rock Performance category since Howard’s band Alabama Shakes in 2016. Alabama Shakes was also the only female-fronted band to win the award since the category’s inception in 2012, and the slates for three of the award’s last nine years included no female-fronted nominees at all.
While far too late in the game, a set of nominees composed exclusively of women is still groundbreaking for the iconic awards ceremony.
“People thought that girls didn’t belong in the rock categories. Girls don’t play rock music,” said Alana Haim in an interview with Variety. One of the three sisters that make up the genrefluid pop rock band, Haim spoke of the ways in which women are routinely dissuaded from picking up an electric guitar or drum sticks to join a genre many see as hypermasculine.
The very music of Bridgers, Howard, Apple, Potter, the Haim sisters, and Lenker, then, is subversive in its rock-influence. Though none of the nominees necessarily play clear-cut “hard rock,” they each stand out as innovators in the genre. Their music bucks traditional rock tropes to lean on more dynamic influences — from the expansive, cerebral qualities of Apple’s restless piano track “Shameika” to the soaring musicality of Bridgers’s “sad girl rock” ballad “Kyoto.”
Still, the slate of nominations leaves much to be desired. Black women in rock are historically under-celebrated, despite their key role in the very creation of the genre. While the much-deserved recognition of Howard and the track “Stay High” from her “black-queer-Southern-feminist” solo album is a massive step forward for the awards show — which has been heavily criticized under the #GrammysSoWhite movement — the Academy’s outward commitment to inclusion must be sustained. Even this year, after the Academy removed the racially-coded term “urban” from its awards categories in an outward show of inclusion, the Album of the Year Category featured fewer Black nominees than in years past — snubbing artists like The Weeknd, whose critically acclaimed and massively successful song “Blinding Lights” and album “After Hours” received zero nominations.
“The Grammys remain corrupt,” he wrote on Twitter, evoking the awards’ long history of racial injustice. “You owe me, my fans and the industry transparency.”
The Grammys corrupt history is one that is in dire need of dismantling, especially when it comes to their treatment of Black women. This means nominating more Black women for the ceremony’s biggest awards while also increasing the diversity of the Recording Academy’s nomination review committee. While the committee has “historically not been comprised of diverse members,” according to an internal task force on diversity and inclusion, and therefore fails to accurately represent the industry, it also holds a massive amount of power in determining who wins each year. The demographics of the committee have improved in recent years — a move which no doubt influenced the greater inclusivity of this year’s Awards — but the work should not end when one Black woman is nominated to a category in a genre historically powered by Black women.
Also important to include is that, while touting the nomination of six women or female-fronted groups to the major categories of Best Rock Performance and Best Country Album as proof of the Grammys purported shift to (finally) include more women, the awards show also includes nominations for the pseudonym of Lukas “Dr. Luke” Gottwald, who allegedly abused pop superstar Kesha while she was signed to his label. In an interview with The Guardian, Apple called out the Grammys for their hypocrisy:
“The feeling of wanting to celebrate with these women was genuine.... I don’t know if anybody who’s nominated can help having the thought: What would I do If I won? My vision was that I would just get up there with a sledgehammer and I wouldn’t say anything, I would take the Grammy and smash it into enough pieces to share and I would invite all the ladies up,” she said. “My second thought was I wonder if I can get all these ladies to boycott this shit because of Dr Luke.”
As a whole, the better-late-than-never nomination of six incredibly deserving women clearly sets a groundbreaking precedent, but it is not enough for the Recording Academy to simply nominate women once and be done with it. The nominations of Bridgers, Howard, Apple, Potter, the Haim sisters, and Lenker — while historic — must also serve as a turning point for the Grammys, bringing with them more space for the recognition of countless female rockers to come.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On her widely acclaimed sophomore album “Punisher,” indie singer-songwriter Phoebe Bridgers set the apocalypse to song. The restless, haunting record guides listeners through her vision of a world, and an artist, in flux, with 11 tracks anchored by lyrics almost devotional in their intense honesty. Four of them underwent another transformation with the help of producer and musician Rob Moose, who collaborated with Bridgers on the sweeping string arrangements that form her new extended play “Copycat Killer.” The EP’s first few seconds of sustained, tentative strings suggest a symphony tuning before a great performance — which the ethereal orchestrations that follow absolutely deliver.
Bridgers’ April release of “Kyoto,” an uptempo rock song with a few cathartic trumpet blasts for good measure, marked a striking change from her typically subdued style. With only two alternating chords in each verse, the track’s harmonic simplicity provides a beautiful contrast to the lyrics’ finely detailed narrative of Bridgers’ first visit to Japan. The “Copycat Killer” version takes a very different — but just as effective — approach in its instrumentation by layering string motifs that surge and recede, introducing unexpected moments of heartbreaking dissonance. Moose’s arrangement turns the opening riff, originally bubbling with the synthetic lilt of a Pocket Piano, into a grand melodic gesture.
An initial cascade of broken octaves blossoms into the EP’s most adventurous accompaniment on “Savior Complex.” Long cello lines balance out the rest of the track — including the jaunty violin flourish that ushers in the second verse — with a fuller sound, adding gravity to a floating tune with equally otherworldly origins. “…It’s one of the only songs I’ve ever written in a dream,” Bridgers said.
“Copycat Killer” replaces the mellow guitar intro of “Chinese Satellite” with a resolute, incisive chord sequence that carries Bridgers to the midpoint of the first chorus. Then, as Bridgers sings about making a wish on the titular satellite, slow strings blanket her voice to create a sonic atmosphere as mysterious and expansive as the night sky. The lyrics grapple with Bridgers’ lack of faith in an afterlife and reluctance to accept the permanence of loss. “I want to believe / Instead, I look at the sky and I feel nothing / You know I hate to be alone / I want to be wrong,” she sings.
The EP’s name comes from the title track of “Punisher,” a tribute to musician Elliott Smith in which Bridgers describes herself as a “copycat killer with a chemical cut,” referencing her bleach-damaged hair and imitation of Smith’s art. “I wrote a song about how, if Elliott Smith were alive, I probably wouldn’t have been the most fun person for him to talk to,” she said in an interview with the New Yorker. Bridgers’ and Moose’s reimagining of “Punisher” punctuates her searching questions to Smith — “What if I told you / I feel like I know you?” — with melodies carefully enunciated in short bow strokes. After almost 13 minutes of immersion in the lush emotions of “Copycat Killer,” it’s hard to tell whether the silence after the track’s abrupt end feels untimely or meant to be.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In recent months, Bob Dylan’s “Never-Ending Tour” has taken its longest hiatus since the folk singer began the now 3,066-show journey in 1988. On April 7, legendary folk iconoclast John Prine passed away from complications due to the coronavirus, leaving behind a 50 year legacy of influential protest music as part of Chicago’s folk revival. On Sept. 26, Farm Aid, a yearly music festival founded in 1985 by folk and folk-rock icons Willie Nelson, Neil Young, and John Mellencamp, moved online, making 2020 the only year in the festival’s 35-year run that artists didn’t perform in-person.
As is true of most spaces, to say that the coronavirus pandemic has hit the folk community hard is an understatement.
American singer-songwriter Kurt Vile’s newest EP, “Speed, Sound, Lonely KV,” perfectly positions itself to pay tribute to these important institutions and figures of folk legend. The indie singer-songwriter cites among his major influences folk icons Neil Young and Prine — and nowhere is that more clear than in “Speed, Sound, Lonely.”
Vile began his music career in earnest as co-founder and lead guitarist of The War on Drugs before parting ways with the band as its popularity grew. By 2009, he had signed to Matador Records as a solo artist, where he wasted no time in releasing his own music. Most critics argue it was his 2013 “Wakin’ on a Pretty Daze” that cemented him in the indie scene.
Like that in “Wakin’ on a Pretty Daze,” the music in “Speed, Sound, Lovely” is firmly rooted in the artist’s indie and folk influences and his characteristically low-key production, as well as his own fingerstyle acoustic guitar and banjo playing. The EP was recorded over a four year period in Nashville, Tenn., and yet the release feels both detached from and strikingly tied to the present.
At first listen, the EP leaves its audience awash in an unplaceable feeling of nostalgia for a simpler time. At the very least, the release evokes nostalgia for a feeling that has been largely missing from the past couple months: peace. Its stripped back production and heavy focus on delicately-layered acoustic guitars leaves the EP airy, light, and bathed in warmth. It’s the kind of release perfect for a summer day spent laying alone in a field of flowers: welcoming and fresh, yet self-aware to the point of heartbreak.
And still, at the heart of the EP is its standing as a tribute to the folk and country icons of the 1960s and ‘70s. The EP is comprised of five songs, three of which are covers. Two of the tracks, “Speed of the Sound of Loneliness” and “How Lucky,” are Prine’s, and one, “Gone Girl,” was originally written by country singer “Cowboy” Jack Clement back in 1970.
Vile’s covers are raw and unassuming, without any of the glitzy frills that dominate the airwaves today. True to their predecessors, the tracks exemplify more of an honest homage to the artists who came before Vile than any kind of commercial rebranding.
While all three of the covers are worthy of repeat listens in their own right — “Speed of the Sound” proves a must-listen for any fan of Neil Young, and “Gone Girl” makes a strong case for Vile’s place as an heir to the folk era — it is Vile’s cover of 1979’s “How Lucky” that cements its rightful place as the centerpiece of “Speed, Sound, Lonely.”
The track, which Vile has called “probably the single most special musical moment in my life,” features the late John Prine himself as the other half to Vile’s duet. Multiple guitars are layered to create a sparkling tapestry of fingerpicked melodies and basslines. In “How Lucky,” folk royalty and its heir come together seamlessly to create a piece of striking beauty. While Prine and Vile spend most of the track taking turns on the song’s verses, catharsis comes in the song’s outro as both their voices blend in a stripped-down harmony. “Well, there was all these things that I don't think I remember / Hey, how lucky can one man get?” they sing in unison.
“Speed, Sound, Lonely KV” also showcases Kurt Vile’s own signature lyrical talent. The two original compositions on the EP, “Dandelions” and “Pearls,” exemplify the two strengths of his songwriting that Vile has been honing for the entirety of his decade-long career.
On “Dandelions,” Vile’s humor takes center stage; the lyrics are simple and to the point. Like a lot of his songs, “Dandelions'' doesn't take itself too seriously. “Dandelions / For my girls,” Vile sings, his voice soft over a simple kick drum rhythm. “I ain't lyin’ / Just bein' a little exotic / You can blow on 'em / Or you can just hold ’em / I ain't mindin' / Even when you're cryin’.”  Musically, “Dandelions” feels peaceful and steady. The acoustic guitar is hypnotic, layered over synths and glittering chimes. For six minutes, the track simply flows and ebbs under Vile’s laid-bare musings on dandelions and his “three girls.” With “Dandelions,” Vile doesn’t make a point to ask for anything from his audience, yet commands listeners’ attention all the same.
“Pearls,” on the other hand, showcases Vile’s flexibility as an artist. His guitar and vocals both take on a freshness that wraps up the EP, hinting at his greater potential. More upbeat than the rest of the EP, “Pearls” toys with the idea of a slightly more rockabilly Vile, while still rooting itself in his obvious folk influences. “Where you been now, little girl? / Did you get your purse all filled with pearls?” Vile sings, the seemingly nonsensical lyrics and Vile’s acoustic guitar solos mingling with an energetic drum beat. Calling back to the legends of folk’s past, Vile leaves his audience with a moment of final, faraway peace.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Undergraduate Council launched a petition Tuesday calling on the College to strengthen support for international students during the spring semester.
The petition requests the College extend the petition deadline for students to decide whether to return to campus for the spring semester, require professors to allow a 12-hour window for international students to submit assignments and exams, and offer a hybrid academic program that features an in-person component.
The Council also urged the College to prioritize international freshmen alongside seniors for spring housing if a hybrid model is implemented. If classes continue fully online, the petition requests that Harvard communicate its reasoning for the decision to international freshmen and their families.
Federal visa restrictions prohibited international freshmen from living on campus during the fall semester because all undergraduate courses were held online. As of now, those same restrictions apply for the spring semester.
“This year, international students have found themselves mentally, physically, and emotionally distant from their peers who reside on campus, which has led to severe detrimental effects on their mental health and social lives,” the Council’s petition reads. “Students feel that the administration of the college has completely forgotten them and does not take their needs into consideration when formulating decisions about college life.”
Several Council members said international students’ input guided their drafting of the petition.
“Our job was simply to amplify, because so many incredible and truly phenomenal international students had come to town halls and told us what their concerns were,” said Ivy Yard Representative Tarina K. Ahuja ’24, one of the statement’s sponsors. “They were the catalyst, they were the ones that brought these ideas to us, and it wouldn’t have been anything of what it is without them.”
Samuel H. Taylor ’24, an international student from New Zealand and “citizen sponsor” of the Council petition, said the fall semester was a “disappointing, unenjoyable experience.”
“We’re promised a transformative experience,” he said. “There hasn’t been much of a transformation at all except for the fact that I’ve spent more time inside, up at weird hours of the night, kind of living a shell of a life.”
Taylor said the Council’s petition incorporated concerns that international students have raised to the University throughout the fall semester, including the need for additional lecture times and flexibility in academic expectations.
“There are some accommodations we think are not unreasonable to expect because we are at a massive disadvantage compared to all of the other students,” Taylor said.
Matilda Marcus ’24, an international student from England and another citizen sponsor of the statement, said the University’s decision to conduct the entire academic year online prevented her from living on campus, despite successfully petitioning for Harvard housing due to a challenging learning environment at home.
“I petitioned to be on campus, and my petition was successful,” Marcus said. “The College said to me, ‘You have enough need to be here, but we’re not going to help you.’”
College spokesperson Rachael Dane did not respond to a request for comment on the Council’s petition.
Elm Yard representative Anant P. Rajan ’24, who also sponsored the petition, said he is confident it will result in greater awareness of the challenges faced by international students.
“I think, historically, the students of Harvard College are wonderful at holding the College accountable, and we’ve seen that actually a lot this year,” Rajan said. “I am confident that the petition will hold traction.”
Sponsor Daniella M. Berrospi ’24, a representative of Ivy Yard, called the petition a “stepping stone to something bigger” in the Council’s support for international students.
“I never think just writing something is ever enough,” she said. “Our work with international students isn’t done.”
As of Saturday evening, the petition had 231 signatures.
