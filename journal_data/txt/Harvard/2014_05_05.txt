After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
 
After seven semesters on The Crimson’s editorial board, including two as an op-ed editor, I would like to use my very last piece as a Crimson columnist to reflect on the role of student journalism at Harvard.
Harvard’s University-funded publication, the Gazette, publicizes University press releases and provides rosy coverage of faculty research and student extracurricular work. The Harvard Magazine, founded in 1898 as the “independent” source for Harvard news, has a strong relationship with the University (one third of its operating revenue is University-funded) but advertises that “the magazine is not published with the aim of promoting financial donations to the University, as development and other publications properly are.”
The Harvard Crimson, then, has a unique position at our university. Founded in 1873, The Crimson remains the oldest continuously published daily college newspaper in the United States. Though our school has no undergraduate journalism or communications degree option, many students devote hours each night to putting out a crisp periodical. Unique among other (nonetheless worthy) student publications, The Crimson is not only prolific but also well-read—and it is delivered each morning to the door-baskets of first-years, the dining halls of upper-class students, and the desks of Harvard’s administrators.
During the few years that I’ve been here, I have seen the Crimson’s reporting, with nuance and care, bring significant topics into campus conversation. In so doing, the paper has often given a platform to those whose voices might not otherwise be heard.
The campus community reads and discusses pieces written by students who have struggled with the University’s response to their sexual assault or mental illness, by workers at Harvard asking for fair and just treatment, and by Harvard’s neighbors asking for productive community engagement. Timely reporting alerts readers about everything from administrative scandals to student and faculty activism. Long-form scrutinies are an opportunity for student reporters to explore multifaceted issues of campus life–from unpaid internships on the mean streets of New York to race and belonging here on the Yard. These investigations are critical to raising the consciousness of the student body, as we have seen with the “I Too Am Harvard” and the “Our Harvard Can Do Better” campaigns.
Even more importantly, The Crimson’s op-eds can catalyze political change. In October 2012, The Crimson published an op-ed titled “Israel versus No. 2 Pencils,” in which Lena K. Awwad ’13 and Shatha I. Hussein ’14 revealed that Israeli authorities had held up that year’s SAT tests, preventing Palestinian students in the West Bank from taking the exam on time. The two authors, who had both graduated from Ramallah Friends School, contextualized this event in broader Palestinian access to secondary and higher education. They wrote, “By depriving this year’s RFS seniors the ability to take the SAT, and more broadly hurting Palestinian education, Israel is jeopardizing the academic trajectories of future leaders.” In response to publicity that op-ed helped generate, the White House became involved and Palestinian students got to sit for the SAT. As I have personally learned in the past few months, publishing your opinion in your school newspaper can reach an audience far beyond the walls of our university.
Of course, The Crimson’s leadership changes every year, and our student newspaper’s approach to journalism and relationship with the university constantly evolve. I am disappointed that The Crimson’s recent editorials direct too equable a gaze at the status quo.
Three years ago, writing about the forthcoming capital campaign, we found something to critique in every single one of the university’s actions: We opined on everything from where Harvard should direct its priorities to the scope of the university community. The Crimson Staff wrote, “[Harvard’s] vision should not be as inward-looking as it currently is; although the capital campaign should include internal improvements, it must prioritize above all else resuming development on the Allston campus and restoring the local community.”
Our tone has now changed: See, for example, last fall’s editorial on the capital campaign, where we declared simply that “The capital campaign requires our unqualified support” and encouraged students and alums to “give generously.” Indeed, to me, the Crimson Staff today seems rather interested in affirming the right of the administration to do whatever it deems appropriate: “Harvard’s recent tuition increase is largely appropriate.” Harvard signing on to the symbolic United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment “will allow careful analysis of investments and strategies without total industry divestment.” Harvard need not go “beyond any legal obligation” to guarantee workers at the DoubleTree Hotel in Allston the right to unionize with employer neutrality. 
This is a shame. Just two years ago, the Crimson Staff wrote an editorial about the role of student journalism, noting proudly that The Crimson “played a part in encouraging [the decision of Harvard Management Company not to reinvest in HEI Hotels and Resorts] through sustained coverage of these accusations as well as repeated calls to investigate the allegations.” We wrote that students “are best in position to experience the effects of the university’s policies and to comment candidly on them,” and that because of this perspective, student journalism “serves as a check on the institutional abuse of power.” I wholeheartedly agree.
You can love this university and still want it to treat its students, workers, and the outside world more justly. By focusing on University policies and student organization practices—and adopting a respectful yet critical perspective—student journalists, whether reporters, columnists, or editorial writers, can influence the way Harvard runs.

In Massachusetts, obtaining a liquor license is notoriously difficult for restaurants. Those licenses are often fairly expensive, but tend to reap dividends for restaurants that obtain them. For some restaurants, a liquor license can be the difference between prosperity and imminent closure—with high costs and long waits, the application process comes with high stakes. Most Massachusetts cities and towns make these stakes even higher by imposing a finite limit on liquor licenses awarded at any given time. Of the state’s 351 cities and towns, only two—Cambridge and Plymouth—set no such limit. Cambridge is right to let the licenses flow—the policy is better for business and better for Cambridge.
 The strict regulations on liquor licenses prevalent in so many Mass. cities and towns have their roots in Prohibition-era anxieties. Worried that Boston would fail in its morals, the state created the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission, which still today sets strict limits of the number of licenses a municipality can award, basing those limits on population. Boston, as the state’s largest city, has the greatest number of licensed establishments, but Cambridge has far more licenses per capita. 
 The reason Cambridge outpaces Boston on a per person basis? The city got an exemption from ABCC regulations (as did Plymouth, of Pilgrim renown). While neighboring Boston and Somerville must set up byzantine systems of license distribution—at times resulting in state officials being jailed for corruption—Cambridge has no such problem. 
 Beyond the benefits of less bureaucracy and fewer convictions for license-related bribery, Cambridge also receives economic benefit because of its exemption. Liquor tends to be fairly expensive, and the increased sales are a boon to Cambridge’s economy. Furthermore, the relative lack of liquor-licensed restaurants in Boston sends workers across the Charles—Boston’s loss is Cambridge’s gain. 
 This is not to say that leaders across the state haven’t tried to get exemptions themselves. Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 and Mayor Thomas M. Menino tried to get Boston an exemption in 2011, and Somerville Mayor Joseph A. Curtatone has sought the same for his city. Both efforts, however, have yet to succeed.
 Massachusetts would likely do well to rid itself of the ABCC and its arcane liquor laws. As Cambridge can attest, unfettered awarding of licenses is good for the economy, and likely does not pose much of a hazard to public safety. (The only real beneficiaries of license restriction are the existing liquor license holders—regulation curbs competition and manufactures a valuable asset, the license.) Furthermore, by lifting the cap on liquor licenses, Massachusetts cities and towns would eliminate one source of government corruption. 
 Until the Commonwealth can better regulate its liquor, Cambridge does well to eschew the regulations, drawing thirsty customers from cities that limit licenses. Though licenses remain fairly expensive, and though the process to gain one may be a hassle, Cambridge removes one obstacle that restaurants must face throughout the rest of the Commonwealth. For choosing a vibrant restaurant scene over ancient liquor laws long overdue for appeal, Cambridge sets an example for its state.

It’s been about four months since I was a real person.
 I know that because all my real person time scales have been out of whack for about that long—for instance, at the moment, it’s been three months since I’ve had breakfast. It’s been five weeks since I’ve been to CVS (and, consequently, it’s been about two weeks since I started using that last little bit of toothpaste at the bottom of the tube when I brush my teeth, which provides never enough paste per serving but still seems to have an endless amount of servings—a fact that is strangely comforting). It’s been about six weeks since I’ve checked my mail and about three seconds since I’ve checked my email. And it’s been between 24 and 48 hours since any kind of water—shower, faucet, or otherwise—has touched my skin.
 The looming deadlines and workspace flexibility of academic work means that there is always something you can do—there is no set downtime. So while working or partying takes priority, all real world things go to the wayside, and students end up looking like a tired, hungry, sweat-caked army in the 16th week of an academic siege—or rather, at the end of a brutal four-month semester.
 But an important question arises from all of this: What happens when we don’t just sacrifice practical concerns for our academic work? What happens when it makes us lose a whole lot more?
 Here’s what I mean: On the last day of classes last week, I walked out of lecture from Sanders Theatre, thinking about what was for lunch (grape pizza?), when a freshman acquaintance of mine came up to me and asked, “How does it feel to be halfway done?”
 I reacted with grace and keen insight: “What?”
 She responded, “You know. You’re done with sophomore year. You’re halfway done.”
 My mental response shared in my vocal eloquence: “Balls.”
 There was good reason for my sudden eloquence—in the couple of weeks leading up to reading period, I had a bit of mid-college crisis. And that crisis relates to the very bottom of this column. 
If you look down there, you’ll notice a couple of things. The first is that the Crimson uses italic font in its attributions. And the second is that I concentrate in English. The crisis is about that last bit. I’m thinking about switching to Astrophysics. And if I did that, I would have to make that decision fairly soon in order to graduate on time.
 So suddenly, walking out of Sanders, I had to face the fact that it was reading period. It was the beginning of the end of the semester—or rather, that it was the beginning of the end of the middle of college. And I still didn’t really know what I wanted to do.
 What’s worse was I had finals to study for and papers to write. I had to try to tame my thoughts, blocking off all the larger concerns in favor of the smaller, more current ones.
 But then another question arose: If not now, then when? When can I think about my future?
 Summers and breaks always seemed like a good time to address larger concerns, like one’s academic path. But, then again, you easily get busy with family or an internship or anything else going on, and your thoughts tend to drift away from the campus you no longer occupy. And then when you get back and take classes in new interesting things, and suddenly you’re stuck in a similar rut, without a break to think.
 One option is to just not think too much about it. That way you graduate college and start at a job. And then you rise through the ranks, succeeding along step-by-step, pressing the gas pedal on your life more and more. Then you succeed enough finally to press the gas pedal of your red convertible on a day off in middle-age, having earned the time to address the question you’ve delayed for so long. Except now it’s in the past tense: “What was it all for?”
 I don’t want to be stuck in the past tense. And I don’t think anyone else does either.
 That’s why it’s important to be aimless for a while now, in order to save time for working toward better aims later on. We may toss personal hygiene and other practical concerns out the wayside in college, but we can’t let our current drive overcome our need to deeply ponder our impractical, larger concerns as well, right now. This may come as a sacrifice to a summer of work or to a paper at school, but it has to be done. 
 So whatever the method—whether a conversation with the parents or mentors of old, or a long walk on the beach listening to Blink-182 (I miss home!), or even a Buzzfeed college major quiz—I encourage everyone to think about life and think about it soon. That way, no matter what you achieve, at least you know you wanted to achieve it.
I want to thank everyone for reading my columns this year. Cheers to you all! You’ve made the year the great fun that it’s been. After the summer, I hope to be back again—maybe with a change in my attribution. For now, this is Dash, signing off as always:

It’s not fashionable to talk about “the truth” in matters of religion. A popular objection to religious tradition goes, “I don’t believe that any single religious tradition can claim to have figured out the truth. Look at how many different religions there are. Look at their different cultural backgrounds, their different basic assumptions. How could anyone rationally adjudicate between all their contesting claims about ultimate reality? And if no rational decision can be made between them, then it’s sheer arrogance for any religion to make an absolute and exclusive claim to the truth.”
The problem with this popular sentiment—what I call “the pluralistic objection”—is that it leaves itself with nowhere to stand. For we are all in the business of making exclusive truth-claims, even though we all stand within some particular perspective or tradition. I think that these two facts are not incompatible, and that it still makes sense to talk about “the truth,” even in this pluralistic age.
I see three positions that the pluralist objector might adopt.
The first is a kind of strong atheism: the “I think all religions are false” view. The problem with this view is that it is inconsistent with the original objection. Declaring that a religion is false is itself an absolute truth-claim. So strong atheism is not an option for the pluralist objector.
The second possibility is to say, “I think all religions are equally true.” This is the view that all religions are really saying the same thing. They are different paths up the same mountain. Their truth-claims are not exclusive but complementary.
The natural response to this view is to ask (politely) whether the objector has truly listened to what all the different religions are actually saying. Religions disagree with each other about the nature of ultimate reality. Christians say that the man Yeshua of Nazareth was in fact the same person who created time and space. Muslims and Jews say he wasn’t. They do not believe that they are talking about or responding to the same ultimate reality in different ways. 
One might reply that, deep down, all religions are expressing the same ultimate reality, and they just don’t realize it. But to say “they just don’t realize it” is an absolute truth-claim at least as sweeping and audacious as any religious truth-claim. So this view is not an option for the pluralist objector, either.
The third view rightly rejects the claim that all the paths are headed up the same mountain, but is still incredulous that any one religion could have the whole truth. The solution, under this view, is to recognize the salvageable bits of each religion: “I think all religions get some things right and other things wrong. I believe what Jesus taught about mercy and forgiveness, but not the final judgment. I believe the Taoist doctrine that true power comes from stillness, but not the doctrine of yin and yang.” And so on. 
 
The problem is, if the objector ever intends to say which bits of any religion are right and which bits are wrong, she must replace those religious truth-claims with her own equally absolute truth-claims. The objector must become their own private religious authority. And this too seems incompatible with the pluralistic objection.
The pluralistic objection is no defeater for the exclusive truth-claims of religious tradition. It is perfectly possible to respect other religions, to practice tolerance and open-mindedness, whilst also defending the claim that “there is truth and I think I’ve found it.” That is not necessarily arrogance. As G. K. Chesterton said, “The purpose of an open mind, like an open mouth, is to close on something solid.”
So where does this leave us? How does one adjudicate between religious traditions? I can only begin to sketch an answer here, and it begins with trying to view the world through the lenses of each religion. And that means participating in religious community. As Markus Bockmuehl has remarked, there’s only so much you can say about stained glass windows of a chapel from the outside.
I remember when I first got glasses. “Tell me which is clearer. One… or two… one… or two,” said the optometrist. I remember my astonishment when I put on the finished glasses and my world (I had never realized how foggy it was) suddenly became clear as crystal. I remember thinking, “People aren’t supposed to be able to see this far.”
Eventually I came to accept that my vision, in its natural state, was not in fact optimal or normative, and that this new, bright, sharp-edged world was truly what people were “supposed to be able to see.” It made the old world more intelligible.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
A little over a year ago, then Brighton resident Paola M. Ferrer was preparing for another disappointment in her search for a home in Allston.
For at least the seventh time over a span of six years, Ferrer had fallen in love with a property in North Allston, the largely residential community north of the Massachusetts Turnpike in which most of Harvard’s land lies. The previous properties had all been scooped up by investors paying in cash before Ferrer could even make an offer, leaving her “heartbroken.”
Realtors, brokers, and friends told her that at her price point she could afford a much bigger home in other neighborhoods and towns in the Boston area. Ferrer, however, could not give up on Allston, she said.
“I felt I was really building community here,” she said. “It was important for me to stay here.”
Ferrer’s perseverance ultimately paid off. After a six-year search—juggling student loan debt, strict housing loan regulations, and the expiration of the contract at the apartment she was renting—she closed on a condominium in North Allston last spring.
“The universe just kind of aligned all of these pieces, and I was able to do it,” she said.
The obstacles Ferrer faced were not unusual, according to Carol Ridge-Martinez, the executive director of the Allston Brighton Community Development Corporation, an organization that creates affordable homes, educates first-time home-buyers, and fosters community leadership.
In recent years, Allston’s location near three large universities—Harvard, Boston University, and Boston College—has compounded the difficulties potential Allston homeowners face. As these universities expand and develop, they alter the housing environment in the neighborhood.
Residents say that cash-paying investors seeking to rent out properties swoop in and purchase newly available houses before potential homeowners have the chance to make a bid. And they worry that the influx of transient students that these investors market the properties to threaten the family-friendly character of Allston, forcing out lower-income families and decreasing the quality of the neighborhood’s housing.
TRIPLE-DECKER 
Over the last ten years, and especially since the recent economic recession, Allstonians have faced the same difficulties in the housing market that have plagued many Boston communities.
Jessica B. Robertson has lived in Allston for ten years and two years ago started looking for a home to buy in North Allston.
“Almost nothing is coming on the market,” she said, adding that the units that do are often out of the price range for young people looking to buy their first home. In addition, Robertson said that community members are growing concerned over the increase in rental prices, the median of which spiked over $300 between 2009 and 2012, according to annual reports by the city of Boston.
Allston residents said that the dearth of available housing as well as rising rental prices can be traced in part to a trend of investors purchasing homes, dividing up the units, and renting them out to populations willing to live in groups, such as university students.


These investors buy up properties—increasingly single-family homes—with cash, making it very difficult for prospective homeowners to be competitive, Ridge-Martinez said.
Buying single-family housing in Allston had not traditionally been cost-effective for investors, making these properties accessible to prospective homeowners such as Ferrer and Robertson, Ridge-Martinez added. But an influx of 20- to 35-year-olds to Allston who are willing to live together and split up rents has made buying up single-family homes a much more lucrative investment in the neighborhood, she wrote in an email.
According to Melina A. Schuler, a spokesperson for the city of Boston, the switch to an investor-owned model was precipitated by the recent recession. Residents who owned their triple-decker homes were hard hit by the foreclosure crisis and often sold their buildings to investors. The recession-induced trend intersected with another, longer term shift in the Boston real estate market that has seen Boston become a center for investment in the last decade, especially for international investors, who approach sellers with cash.
Allston is especially attractive to investors due to Harvard’s expansive development of North Allston over the next decade and the high student demand from BC and BU for off-campus housing, according to Brian Swett, chief of environment and energy for the city of Boston. The neighborhood is relatively cheap and convenient, compared to others in Boston, for students hoping to live off campus, according to annual reports on median rents by the city of Boston.
Though these trends have brought Allston an occupancy rate higher than any other neighborhood in Boston, many Allstonians say they are concerned that rental units catering exclusively to students could lead to a community of mostly transient populations who never settle down in Allston.
“It is important for neighborhood stabilization for renters like me to find a home and be able to stay,” Robertson said. This is difficult when landlords market properties to groups of students, instead of young renters looking for a more stable community, she added.
“So long as we continue to have a very short-term renting situation, it’s going to be really difficult to get people to take some pride in the neighborhood or get involved,” Ferrer said.
INVESTMENT BUZZ
These community concerns arise within a neighborhood that is growing and changing demographically. The population of Allston grew 14 percent between 2000 and 2010, a growth rate almost three times that of the City of Boston as a whole, according to U.S. census data compiled by the Boston Redevelopment Authority.
Swett said that the housing stocks of many neighborhoods in Boston, including Allston, have switched to investor-owned models. Only 10.2 percent of housing units in Allston were resident-owned in 2011, down from 15.0 percent in 2009 and 19.6 percent in 2000, according to census data compiled by the BRA. Swett estimates that number is even lower today.
He also noted that as of 2010, 75 percent of investor-owned property in Allston-Brighton were triple-decker homes, which have traditionally been family-owned.
Ridge-Martinez attributed gentrification in Allston to a general increase in interest in urban living as well as to the allure of Harvard’s development in the neighborhood, among other forces.
“The buzz of Harvard’s master plan is very attractive to a lot of people,” she said.
Harvard has embarked on a ten-year institutional master plan in North Allston that will include 1.4 million square feet of new development and 500,000 square feet of renovations.
The projects within the IMP will parallel construction of a science complex on Western Ave. that will house the engineering school and a mixed-use development at Barry’s Corner including both residential and retail space that broke ground last December. Ridge-Martinez said that these development plans have played a role in driving increased investment interest in neighborhood properties.
Allston resident John Eskew similarly described the effect of Harvard’s development in Allston.
“Developers try to get ahead of that wave and that definitely drives up prices and pushes out the working class people,” he said.
With prices increasing, Ridge-Martinez said that the city and organizations such as the Allston Brighton Community Development Corporation must develop strategies to allow lower-income families to stay in the neighborhood.
“We have a vision of Allston-Brighton as a mixed-income community,” she said. “Can we keep a placeholder for maintaining some of the character of the community?”
FINDING A BALANCE
While community members and city officials largely agree that the changes to Allston’s housing stock are eroding the cohesion of the community, a variety of strategies for addressing residents’ unease have been proposed involving both the city and the universities flanking the community.
“The community does not resent the students for living here,” Allston resident Richard Parr ’01 said. Instead, he said, homeowners and other residents are frustrated by absentee landlords who split up properties for transient populations and neglect their units.
Both Allstonians and city officials said that universities in the area have a responsibility to increase housing for their students. Students from BU and BC make up the majority of students renting in Allston, as Harvard students currently tend to cluster across the Charles River in Cambridge.
 
“The city of Boston has an interest in making sure universities provide as much on-campus housing as possible,” Swett said, adding that the city is working with universities both to promote on-campus living and to get information about where students are living off-campus to prevent overcrowding.
Swett also pointed to the Dec. 2012 establishment of a chronic offenders registry for Boston landlords who fail to correct issues on their properties as a recent development in combatting negligent landlords. Those on the registry, which is still in development, are subject to heavy fines. Swett hopes that universities will advertise the registry to their students once it is opened and in so doing help alleviate the most egregious problems with landlords.
Allstonians also noted the need for a strong city response to negligent landlords.
Allston resident Matthew Danish noted that community members were pleased with an new inspection program that went into effect in January. The program requires property owners to register unoccupied properties with the city and pay a $25 registration fee per property, with property inspections once every five years. Though some landlords claim the program is a burden, Danish sees it as the city “stepping up inspection services” and helping those in need.
Allston residents often emphasize the potential for development on the vast tracts of Harvard-owned land in North Allston, especially the undeveloped property along Western Avenue, for commercial and residential purposes.
“Harvard has a lot of vacant land at a time when there’s a desperate need for housing,” Robertson said, adding that the community was very pleased with the Barry’s Corner Residential and Retail Commons, where the University partnered with a private developer to build private housing as well as retail space.
The University included a $3 million homeownership stabilization fund in its community benefits package to Allston. The package is part of Harvard’s institutional master plan and was approved last November by the Harvard-Allston Task Force, an advisory board the BRA has charged with acting as a liaison between the neighborhood, the city, and the University.
For her part, Brigid O’Rourke, Harvard’s communications officer for University planning and community programs, wrote in an email that Harvard and the BRA are still crafting the specific details of the cooperation agreement that includes the fund, which will be managed by a third-party organization.
“Community members recognize that there are no easy answers,” Danish said, even as the University and the city have begun to confront Allstonians’ concerns over the changing nature of the neighborhood’s housing stock. The extent to which Harvard’s development will bring other real estate developers to Allston also remains to be seen and emphasizes the uncertainty of the future of the patterns that worry residents, he added.
In the meantime, for prospective homeowners looking to buy in Allston, the struggle to compete with investors’ deep pockets is unlikely to change.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s lacrosse team played well on Sunday afternoon, but unfortunately for the Crimson, Penn played just a little bit better. Harvard (10-6, 5-1 Ivy) faced the visiting Quakers (11-3, 4-2) in the Ivy League Tournament championship game and was ultimately defeated, 7-5.
“It’s a heartbreaking loss for our players because they have played their hearts out,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “In a couple of areas, Penn was better than us overall, and in a really tight, close Ivy League game, that makes all the difference.”
Faceoff wins for Penn defined the match. Danny Feeney, the Quaker faceoff man, beat the Crimson’s Gabriel Mendola in 11 of the day’s 15 faceoff opportunities.
“Feeney…is very quick, and he was a touch quicker than us today,” Wojcik said. “I thought we battled, but in the end it was a key area where they outplayed us, and in a tight game that definitely helped tip the balance.”
In the first quarter alone, Feeney scrapped for all seven ground balls at the 50-yard line, giving his offense a number of opportunities in its attacking half of the field.
Despite the faceoff losses, the Crimson began the game with a strong surge, taking a 4-0 lead in the first quarter. The Quakers then gathered their bearings and silenced the Harvard attack in the second and third quarters, tying the score at four heading into the final period of play.
“They’re obviously a good defense,” co-captain Peter Schwartz said. “That’s why they are ranked what they are ranked in the country…. But at the same time, we got away from some of the things that we usually do pretty well. I think we got a little comfortable because we had success early in the game.”
Harvard outshot Penn, 37-29, with 15 shots coming in the second half of play. However, the Crimson was unable to find the back of the net for nearly 45 minutes.
“They [have] a good goalie in there,” Schwartz said. “And then we just didn’t shoot the shots that we were planning on shooting.”
Harvard struggled with shot selection, an aspect that the team has not had much trouble with throughout the season. This competition marks the lowest scoring game for the Crimson in Ancient Eight play. Critical Harvard attackers—sophomores Devin Dwyer, Ian Ardrey, and Will Walker—put just two combined points on the board.
“We had less possessions,” Wojcik said. “I don’t think they shut Devin down, I just don’t think we hit our shots.”
After the Quakers responded to the early Harvard scoring drive with four unanswered goals, the Crimson defense answered by smothering Penn’s attack in the third. The scoring drought seemed contagious, as neither team got on the board in those 15 minutes of play.
“[The third quarter was] obviously a critical point in the game,” junior goalie Jake Gambitsky said. “We are tied at the half. We know that next goal matters a lot. So I think the [defense] did a great job. [It] buckled down, and did a great job of limiting what Penn may have been getting in the first half. We are definitely proud of that effort.”
Quaker players Nick Doktor and Isaac Bock, who scored 19 and 17 goals, respectively, during the season, managed to get the ball past Gambitsky just one time. Star attacker Zack Losco scored just three goals and was unable to pass for an assist, thanks in large part to a strong defensive effort from junior long stick midfielder Brian Fischer.
“Fischer did a great job,” Wojcik said. “Losco is their key engine offensively and in transition, and in 6-on-6 as well…. I thought we really executed our defensive game plan. And especially on those picks, Fischer was able to stay with the matchup and did a really great job locking him down.”
Fischer, who was awarded a spot in the All-Tournament team, tallied two ground balls and two caused turnovers for the afternoon, helping keep the Crimson in the game.
With the victory, Penn secured a automatic spot in the NCAA tournament. But Harvard’s postseason is not over yet. The Crimson, having secured an at-large bid, will visit sixth-seeded Notre Dame on Saturday.
“It’s out of our control,” Wojcik said. “There are a number of variables that will play out here…. I know that we are a great team. We hope to get a bid, but we don’t decide that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
The No. 1 Radcliffe lightweight crew team headed to Camden, N.J. on Sunday to compete in the EAWRC Sprints event as the regatta’s defending champion. In winning the Ulbrich Trophy for the second straight year, the varsity eight set a new course record on the Cooper River.
“The results are a great testament to the resilience and drive of this team,” co-captain Andrea Linares said. “We put up some great numbers against some great teams. The field was very competitive today, and we put out all that we had. All teams should be very proud.”
The EAWRC brought together familiar faces Boston University and Princeton in addition to opponents from Wisconsin to compete for the Konrad Ulbrich Points Trophy, awarded to the team with the best overall performance.
The Black and White’s varsity eight ran one of the best races of its season, coming in at 6:26.536, four seconds ahead of the second place Badgers. The Tigers and Terriers followed in third and fourth, respectively.
"The 1V went out there today feeling fully prepared for anything that was thrown at them," said Radcliffe head coach Lou Berl. "They were calm, confident, and composed when they shoved off the dock, and looked as hungry and tough as ever. It was a beautiful race.”
It was a successful day for the Black and White’s other boats as well. In the second varsity eight race, the Radcliffe crew crossed with a time of 6:46.139, placing it in second behind Boston University (6:45.569), and ahead of Wisconsin (6:50.247) and Princeton (7:25.344).
The varsity four finished in similar fashion, notching a second place finish (7:51.957). The boat came in five seconds behind the Badgers (7:46.455) but well ahead of the Terriers (8:07.438) and Tigers (8:57.90).
Rounding out the competition was the Black and White novice four boat, which crossed in 8:13.567 against first place Wisconsin (7:56.330) and third place Boston University (8:16.892).
"I am impressed with our team's performance this weekend in each event's competitive field," said co-captain Elizabeth Lenczowski. "We are grateful to have such strong competition from Princeton, Wisconsin, and BU…and look forward to racing again in June at the IRA regatta."

 It’s reading period, and if you’ve got papers to write, we know that you’re probably going to spend a lot of time procrastinating. At Harvard, when surrounded by overachievers who probably wrote their papers two weeks ahead of time, procrastination can sometimes feel like a dark and lonely place. That’s why Flyby is here to remind you that you are not alone. In fact, we’ll be right here to hold your hand and walk you through each stage.
 
STAGE ONE: Unfounded Motivation and ConfidenceWow, this is going to be great. I know I only have one night to write, and it might seem like I’m kinda screwed, but it’s totally OK. I’m going to sit down and do it right now. I’ve got this!
 
STAGE TWO: “Productive” DistractionsWait, but I need to check my email first. What if there was a change in the assignment? What if my professor needs to reach me? It’s totally important that I look at Gmail.
Twenty new emails? That’s not good. This would be the perfect time to clean out my inbox. It’ll only take a second.
OK, I’m so glad I did that. I feel great. Now I can start writing without all those emails looming over my head. 
 
STAGE THREE: Definitely Not Productive DistractionsWait, it can’t hurt to check Facebook for a second first, right? Checking my email made me feel so productive.
Hmm, a friend request. What? Who is this person?
Ohhhh. He’s in my lecture. Got it. Okay.
Wow. He’s kind of cute. Wait, I definitely need to look at every picture ever taken of him since the seventh grade.
OK, I definitely know a lot about him now. But that wasn’t really a waste of time. I’m fine. I’ll just get started now.
 
STAGE FOUR: False StartI’m just going to open this word document and write an outline. That’s what I’ll do.
Wow, blank word documents are so intimidating.
 
STAGE FIVE: Extreme and Inexplicable HungerI’m starving!! God, when was the last time I ate? Dinner? That was like 3 hours ago. I definitely deserve a snack break….
 
STAGE SIX: Skewed Perception of Minimal ProgressYay! I just wrote like half a page. That only took me like ten minutes! I’ve got this in the bag. I can’t believe I was avoiding this for so long. I definitely can take a break and go on Facebook for a second. And maybe grab another snack…
 
STAGE SEVEN: Panic Mode—When the Real Work Gets DoneOh, my God! It’s 3 a.m.?! How did that even happen? OK, procrastination over, time to write.
