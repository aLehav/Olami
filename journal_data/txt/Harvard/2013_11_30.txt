After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Even though I’ve been abroad for the past several months, I’ve tried hard to keep up with the latest news from campus. Here’s a modest proposal of what I believe occured on campus since I left.
 
1. The election of Weinstock Samuels as president of the Crimson, the third in an ongoing legacy of Samuels-brothers presidents. Congratulations to the family.
 
2. The transition of the Arts board to magazine-only, as print journalism continues to dominate the world of media.
 
3. The bloody Clark-Mayopoulos Undergraduate Committee coup and classic broken campaign promises as insidious neoliberal cost-recovery strategies result in 0.5-ply toilet paper and a ban on tomato basil ravioli soup.
 
4. The seventh consecutive Harvard victory over Yale in the 138th annual Hunger Games.
 
5. The Rappers Are Misogynists And Kanye Is “Too Proud” Despite His Record-Breaking Success And Status As An Authentic And Revolutionary Icon riot outside Kanye West’s talk at the Graduate School of Design and the resulting hundreds of student deaths.
 
6. The unrest surrounding the unequal availability of gender-neutral housing options in upperclassmen houses, though, if you think about it, “gender-neutral” is meaningless considering there are still no smoking-allowed housing options available to anyone.
 
7. The announced implementation of morning weekend shuttle service and accompanying new initiative to start entryway-dining hall shuttle service.
 
8. The announcement of the new campus center, located off-campus, whose mission, as stated by University President Drew G. Faust, is “to be the SOCH of the river houses, in that it will be, in the words of Galadriel, a last-resort light in dark places, when and only when all other lights go out.”
 9. The ongoing investigation into the email-search scandal, which included a round of email searches, which resulted in another investigation, another round of email searches, and this frustrated statement from the administration and my mom: “Well, you shouldn’t be sending out anything you wouldn’t want me to see anywhere on the internet anyways.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
1. Barney Matthews (Frankie Faison), “The Silence of the Lambs”
Barney Matthews is one of the orderlies at the hospital where Hannibal Lecter is incarcerated in the beginning of the movie. Matthews and Lecter become fast friends, which is probably why Lecter doesn’t eat him.
 
2. Jeryline (Jada Pinkett Smith), “Tales From the Crypt Presents: Demon Knight”
Jada Pinkett Smith (playing a convict on work release) kills lots of people in a hotel for “the greater good.”
 
3. Danny Rich (Ice Cube), “Anaconda”
This anaconda don’t want none… because Ice Cube kills it with an ax at the end. Afterwards, he drifts down the river to finish filming a documentary.
 
4. Ronald Jones (LL Cool J), “Halloween H20: 20 Years Later”
School security guard Ronny Jones (LL Cool J) is accidentally shot five times by some skittish guy skulking around a school at night. He miraculously survives his gunshot wounds and drags a girl out of a cafeteria before she gets stabbed.
 
5. Karla Wilson (Brandy Norwood), “I Still Know What You Did Last Summer”
Karla is the well-meaning friend of Jennifer Love Hewitt’s character who accidentally leads all of her friends to their demise by taking them on an exotic vacation. Next time, they’ll probably opt for Florida instead.
 
6. Eddie Baker (Taye Diggs), “House on Haunted Hill”
In a movie with a plot that basically mimics Agatha Christie’s “And Then There Were None,” Eddie runs away until the sun rises and he can get the heck away from a dinner party gone awry. He gets five million dollars for his trouble, though, which is a small reward for having to watch a bunch of people get killed over appetizers.
 
7. Selena (Naomie Harris), “28 Days Later”
Selena fights for survival in the midst of a terrifying pandemic that tears London apart. Not only does she kill some infected people, save some lives, and escape from brutal captors, but she also gets the guy in the end. Talk about a perfect ending.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
ANCHORAGE, ALASKA—The Harvard men’s basketball team is locked in a tight battle with Wisconsin-Green Bay at halftime of its Carrs/Safeway Great Alaska Shootout semifinal, with the score tied at 34.
The Crimson got off to a fast start, scoring the first seven points of the contest. Co-captain Laurent Rivard matched Harvard’s total number of three point attempts from Thursday night’s contest in the first three minutes, hitting one of his looks from deep.
But an 8-0 run midway through the first half gave the Phoenix its first lead of the game. The two teams exchanged leads three more times throughout the remainder of the half, and a jumper at the buzzer by sophomore point guard Siyani Chambers tied the score once more.
Harvard’s offensive attack has been quite balanced; all five starters finished the half with six points. Junior forward Steve Moundou-Missi also added five rebounds. Green Bay’s Keifer Sykes and Alec Brown have been the focal points of the Phoenix offense, tallying 11 and 10 points, respectively.
With two free throws, senior forward Kyle Casey eclipsed the 1,000 point mark for his career.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
ANCHORAGE, ALASKA—For much of Friday night’s game against Wisconsin-Green Bay, there was little to separate the Harvard men’s basketball team (6-1) from the Phoenix (3-2) on either side of the floor. But a late offensive outburst and a surprise defensive shift proved to be the difference for the Crimson, which advanced to the championship game of the Carrs/Safeway Great Alaska Shootout with a 76-64 victory at Sullivan Arena.
Waiting for Harvard in the final is TCU, which prevailed over Tulsa in the other semifinal, 72-65, after upsetting Indiana State in the first round.
“All you have to do is look up in the rafters [of Sullivan Arena] and you see all the great names and great teams that have participated and that have been champions here,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “We talked about that coming into this, that how cool and how nice it could be if somehow we could win this tournament and have our name associated with some of the other great basketball programs.”
Green Bay was picked to finish first in the Horizon League preseason poll, and the Phoenix played like it in the first half, matching Harvard bucket for bucket. The Crimson got off to a fast start, scoring the first seven points of the contest, but an 8-0 run midway through the first half gave Wisconsin-Green Bay its first lead of the game. The two teams exchanged leads three more times throughout the remainder of the half, and a jumper at the buzzer by sophomore point guard Siyani Chambers tied the score once more.
The second half featured just as much back-and-forth action as the first; the lead changed hands six times in four minutes early in the second frame. For seven straight minutes, neither team led by more than four points. Junior guard Wesley Saunders carried the Harvard offense for stretches, finishing with 20 points and seven rebounds.
Green Bay junior guard Keifer Sykes was the focal point of the Phoenix offense, finishing with a game-high 26 points. A preseason all-Horizon League selection, the 5’11” Sykes, who also boasts a 44-inch vertical leap, used his lightning-quick first step to attack the rim, blowing past the 6’5” Saunders on a few occasions.
“He’s a great player,” Saunders said. “His quickness was something that we had talked about and his ability to get to the basket. It was a tough defensive assignment.”
But the Crimson made a crucial defensive adjustment down the stretch, switching from man-to-man to a 2-3 zone, which disrupted the Phoenix offense, and in particular the penetration of Sykes, who could not find a path through the clogged lane.
“They packed into a 2-3; it bothered us a little bit,” said Green Bay head coach Brian Wardle. “We hadn’t seen one all year, haven’t seen it from them on film, so we were a little stagnant and settled on jump shots.”
With the Phoenix unable to hit a jumper, the Crimson offense seized the advantage and began to pull away. Chambers had two tough left-handed finishes in transition, and a Rivard three capped off a 10-0 run that gave Harvard an advantage it would not relinquish. The Crimson was able to put the game away at the free throw line, making its final eight attempts to preserve the lead.
Harvard had much more difficulty scoring down low in Friday’s contest than the night before. After having its way at times with Denver on Thursday, the Crimson saw nine of its shot attempts sent back by the long-armed Green Bay frontcourt.
Still, Harvard recorded a similar advantage on the glass as against the Pioneers, outrebounding the Phoenix, 40-28. Junior forward Jonah Travis totaled eight offensive rebounds by himself, and Wardle cited his energy as “the difference maker” in the game.
It was also a night of milestones for two of Harvard’s senior leaders. With two free throws in the first half, forward Kyle Casey eclipsed the 1,000-point mark for his career. Co-captain Laurent Rivard also scored his 1,000th point, and a triple from the left wing with four minutes remaining made him the Crimson’s all-time leading three-point shooter. Now with 221 made threes for his career, Rivard passed the previous mark of 220 set by Dan Clemente ’01.
“[The record is] a really nice thing to have,” Rivard said. “Obviously I can’t do it without my teammates. Today, every open shot that I got was because of my teammates.”
Rivard finished five-for-12 from beyond the arc for the game. His 12 three-point attempts quadrupled the team’s total from the night before, and Rivard matched that total by himself in the first three minutes of the game.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
ANCHORAGE, ALASKA —The banners above Sullivan Arena honoring past champions of the Carrs/Safeway Great Alaska Shootout feature a “who’s who” of college basketball bluebloods: Kentucky, North Carolina, Duke, Kansas, UCLA, Michigan State. Now joining them in the last year before the tournament moves out of its 36-year home is Harvard, which never trailed in cruising to the title with a convincing display over TCU, winning by a final margin of 71-50.
“I’m very proud of our team to come here and play at such a prestigious tournament,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “This is one of the more famous tournaments in all of college basketball. You look at the history and tradition of it, and it’ll tell you exactly why that is, all the great teams that have won this tournament, and we’re very thrilled to know that we were in it.”
Junior guard Wesley Saunders was named the tournament’s Most Outstanding Player, with an average of 14.3 points, eight rebounds, and 4.7 assists per game over the three Shootout contests. Sophomore point guard Siyani Chambers and junior forward Steve Moundou-Missi were named to the all-tournament team along with Saunders.
“[Saunders] was very deserving of the Most Outstanding Player,” Amaker said. “There’s no question, he earned that. Wesley does everything for us on both ends of the floor, no doubt about it, he’s our best player.”
The drama for Harvard was contained in Friday night’s semifinal against Green Bay; the Horned Frogs, the only representatives of a BCS conference at the Shootout, were unable to match the Crimson’s level of play from the start. The Crimson played a complete half of basketball in the first frame, assisting on 17 of its 20 field goals and holding TCU to 29 percent shooting. Harvard added seven steals and three blocks on defense and committed only four turnovers of its own on its way to a 48-25 first half advantage.
Co-captain Laurent Rivard extended his own school record for three-point field goals, finding holes in TCU’s 2-3 zone and hitting four of his five three-pointers in the first period as the catalyst of Harvard’s 21-6 run to open the game. Rivard attempted 24 of Harvard’s 35 three-point attempts for the tournament, knocking down 10 of those tries.
“When you move the ball, the defense can’t keep up,” Rivard said. “The ball travels a lot faster than the players, so we just had a great half. I found myself open most of the time.”
In what was a recurring theme throughout the tournament, Harvard won the rebounding battle handily, grabbing 44 boards to the Horned Frogs’ 27. Junior forward Jonah Travis provided another efficient effort, chipping in 11 points and seven rebounds in 16 minutes of action, and sophomore Evan Cummins added ten points, six blocks, and five rebounds in fifteen minutes.
“Everybody’s unselfish,” Saunders said. “We were sharing the ball. Everybody was making the extra pass and looking to get everybody involved, so it was just a great team win.”
The second half was sloppy on both sides. The Horned Frogs shot an even worse percentage from the field, going seven-for-32, and the Crimson turned the ball over 17 times, drawing Amaker’s ire midway through the half. TCU attempted 26 free throws to the Crimson’s 10—the only thing keeping the game remotely close—but the Horned Frogs were unable to cut the deficit below 13 in the second half. TCU guard Kyan Anderson was one of the few bright spots for the runners-up, totaling 11 second-half points and 20 for the game.
Harvard had a brief scare in the second half when Saunders stayed down below the Horned Frogs’ basket after a wild swing at a block attempt, seemingly favoring his left hand. But after a few minutes on the bench, Saunders re-entered the game and showed no ill effects from the injury.
The Great Alaska Shootout will move across town next year to the brand new Alaska Airlines Center, a $109 million facility on the campus of Alaska-Anchorage. The last image for the building that has seen many future NBA players compete under its roof was freshman guard Matt Fraschilla dribbling out the clock on a comfortable Harvard victory.
“To have a chance to play the way we played for three games and to win this tournament, we’re very, very proud,” Amaker said. “It’s something we’ll hang on to for a lifetime.”
