After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The  Cambridge Police Department hired a new spokesperson, 23-year-old  Daniel M. Riviello, on Friday, ending a four-month long search.
A   graduate of Hartwick College who majored in political science and economics, Riviello begins as “communications specialist,” a  newly-created, non-police force position, on May 24 with a salary of  $42,293.
“I’ve always been interested in public service,” Riviello said. “This  job seemed like a perfect fit between my skills and my passion.”
Riviello  said that he hopes to revitalize the relationship between the police  force and the community, in the wake of last July’s arrest of Harvard  African-American Studies Professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr. which led to  national media attention, and ended with Gates and the officer who  arrested him, Sgt. James Crowley, sharing a beer at the White House with  President Barack Obama.
The scandal ultimately led to the reassignment of former Cambridge  Police Department Spokesperson Frank D. Pasquarello.
“This is a  great opportunity for the Cambridge Police Department to start over with  the media and the community and to build new positive relationships,”  Riviello said.
Riviello also said that he believes his youth will help in his planned  efforts to involve the many college students in Cambridge in the Police  Department’s work.
“I want to really engage the youth in Cambridge,”  he said. “I will get young people involved by using social media like  Facebook and Twitter to communicate in the area in the ways that young  people do today.”
Riviello added that the fact that the position is new gives him more  space to define it himself.
“I can go in and make it my own,” he  said.
Riviello currently works as the Public Relations Coordinator  and member of the marketing department Book of Odds, a start-up website  in Boston that provides information about probability, where he has been  employed since June of 2008.
Riviello said he has never worked for a Police Department before, but  has been involved in public service and worked for Mass. Senator John F.  Kerry in 2006.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED 12:42 a.m.
A former Harvard student was indicted Monday for falsifying information in his applications to Harvard and for several scholarships.
Adam Wheeler, 23, was indicted on 20 counts of larceny, identity fraud, falsifying an endorsement or approval, and pretending to hold a degree. Wheeler was allegedly "untruthful" in his applications to the University and in scholarship applications, according to a statement released Monday by Middlesex District Attorney Gerry Leone.
As a senior in September 2009, Wheeler allegedly submitted fraudulent applications for the Harvard endorsement for both the United States Rhodes Scholarship and the Fulbright Scholarship.
His application packet included fabricated recommendations from Harvard professors and a college transcript detailing perfect grades over three years. Wheeler's resume listed numerous books he had co-authored, lectures he had given, and courses he had taught, according to authorities.
Wheeler's transgressions came to light when a Harvard professor noticed similarities between Wheeler's work and that of another professor during the application review process for the Rhodes Scholarship. The professor then compared the two pieces and voiced concerns that Wheeler plagiarized nearly the entire piece.
Wheeler’s file was referred to University officials, who decided—upon discovering the falsified transcript—to open a full review of Wheeler’s academic file. Wheeler was invited to present his case at a disciplinary hearing convened by University officials, but decided to await the decision at his home in Delaware rather than attend the meeting, according to the press release.
University officials and Harvard police then discovered that Wheeler had never attended MIT or Phillips Academy in Andover, as his file claimed. In addition, Wheeler’s SAT scores were not perfect, as conveyed in a College Board document in his file.
Wheeler's recommendations—allegedly signed by professors at Bowdoin College, which Wheeler attended before transferring to Harvard—were falsely attributed to individuals who said that they did not know Wheeler and had not written the letters, according to the press release.
The defendant is alleged to have "stolen over $45,000 in grants, scholarship and financial aid money awarded to him on applications and submissions of documents that were based on lies and reproductions of other people’s hard work,” Leone said in the statement.
This is not the first time Wheeler has fallen under scrutiny for offenses in an academic setting. He was suspended from Bowdoin due to academic dishonesty.
Wheeler was a member of the Class of 2010 who transferred to Harvard at the beginning of his sophomore year and became a resident of Kirkland House. An English concentrator, he received a Hoopes Prize in the spring of 2009 for a project that he had completed during his junior year.
“He was a good guy who didn’t talk about his academics or his life history much, but he came off as very smart. We just allowed him his privacy,” a source close to Wheeler, who did not wish to be named, said in an interview Monday.
Wheeler did not receive a Harvard degree, according to Jeff Neal, spokesperson for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
The defendant will be arraigned Tuesday at the Middlesex Superior Court.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the end of the school year comes studying for finals, finishing up papers, and packing up the dorm rooms. But it also signals the near end of this year’s track season, and with that, the ECAC and IC4A Championships.
This past weekend, those who qualified traveled to Princeton, N.J., to represent Harvard in the meets. The men’s team tied for 51st in the IC4A competition, while the women finished 31st in the ECAC meet.
“I was pleased with the performances,” Crimson coach Jason Saretsky said. “It’s not easy to bounce back the week after the Ivy League championships and to go out there and compete again, especially being in the middle of final exams, but I thought we had a couple of really strong performances.”
One of these came from junior Claire Richardson, who led Harvard with a second-place finish in the 3K run and crossed the line at 9:23.03, breaking a 21-year old school record by over two seconds. She was supported by freshman Mary Hirst, who took eighth in the high jump with a clearance of 1.65 meters, and sophomore Nicole Sliva, who placed 14th in the heptathlon.
On the men’s side, freshman Fedor Garin finished eighth in the pole vault after clearing a height of 4.80 meters. Freshman Edward Brucker and co-captain Jack Brady placed 12th and 13th in the shot put, respectively, while Brady followed this performance with an eighth-place mark in the hammer throw of 58.21 meters.
Two 800-meter runners, junior Brian Hill and freshman Carlyle Davis, also clocked in their lifetime bests in the event.
“I thought everyone did really well,” Brady said. “People walked away really happy from the meet.”
“Everyone that competed gave a great effort,” Saretsky said. “It was a good performance to end the season, and we have a number of athletes that are going to be continuing on to the regional meet [in two weeks].”
These NCAA Regional Championship meets, held in Greensboro, N.C., will take place May 28-29.

There’s a new burger in town! And it’s named after a pretty interesting Harvard Law School graduate…and no, it's not Barack Obama (they already have one dedicated to him). But you're getting warmer...
If you haven’t noticed yet, there’s a new sign outside of Mr. Bartley’s Gourmet Burgers that reads: "The Elena Kagan: Experience??? 'Don’t ask, don’t tell': A burger smothered with a liberal amount of salsa and grilled pineapple served with onion rings. $9.99.” A burger inspired by Obama's Supreme Court nominee? Of course we had to try it.
When we first arrived at Bartley's, there was, as always, a line stretching past the Harvard Bookstore, and the smell of the burgers and fries coming from the little restaurant only affirmed our hunger and excitement for the “experience”.
During the 15 minute wait in line outside the famous burger cottage, we started to wonder whether this curious burger actually existed. When we told the waitress that we wanted the Elena Kagan, she questioned our choice and even asked how the name was spelled.
Eventually, though, the order was in, and exactly 15 minutes later, we were seated at a long table in the middle of the restaurant. Everyone around us had already gotten their burgers, but it seemed that nobody had been daring enough to try the Elena Kagan, so we really had no idea what to expect.
Finally, the Elena Kagan arrived. Just as the sign had promised, the medium-well burger was topped with salsa and two slices of grilled pineapple, giving it a rather tall and daunting appearance. It was an interesting choice: a nice mix of sweet and spicy, but not enough to overwhelm the famous taste of the Bartley's burger.
Bill Bartley, the owner of the famous burger shack, couldn't be reached for comment, so you'll have to draw your own conclusions about what this burger says about Obama's nominee.
