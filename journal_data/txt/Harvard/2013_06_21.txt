After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
SHANGHAI, China—As a native New Yorker, I joked to my friends and family that I wouldn’t get homesick in Shanghai since it’s China’s New York City.  Yet, I didn’t anticipate how true that would be.
It would be overly simplistic to say that Shanghai is a duplicate of New York City with Mandarin and smog.  My transition to Shanghai has not been seamless, but that was not due to culture shock but rather unexpected moments of recognition.
More than a few times I’ve stood at an intersection and realized that 75 percent of the pedestrians were”laowai”, or foreigners. I know how to say “You make my heart beat too fast” in Mandarin from watching a Chinese reality TV show that follows the exact format of “The Voice”. (Now, that’s a phrase which might be useful in certain circumstances.).  I even spotted a copy of “The Harvard Business Review” through the pane of Plexiglas between my desk and my co-worker’s.
I know that I am more attuned to Shanghai’s westernization because I am a Westerner myself.  And perhaps spending last summer in Beijing has made me less cognizant of how different life is here.  Nonetheless, I hope that when I return home, my most prominent memories aren’t of pristine streets lined with luxury Western brands, but instead of something uniquely Shanghai.

ATLANTA, GEORGIA—It’s a summer rite of passage – visiting the relatives you never see.
No, I don’t mean the people.  I mean the puppies.
Since I’m so reluctant to leave the air conditioning, I’ve spent my trip seeing little of Atlanta beyond my cousins’ TV screen.  I’ve learned a lot about their dogs, though.  It’s strange, to visit a new city and find oneself preoccupied with a pair of fluffballs.
Griffin, the Bichon Frisé, has become an old man since I last saw him.  He will pathetically throw himself at the couch until someone gives his butt a boost.  Sophie, the coffee-colored Toy Poodle, seems as youthful as ever.  She follows me around the house, leaping at my knees.
Despite the sweltering humidity, the dogs bound through the backyard like it’s a crisp autumn morning.  I, on the other hand, thought I was going to die of excessive sweating after the five-minute walk to Moe’s Southwest Grill. Hailing from California, Moe’s was my first introduction to such gems as the “Homewrecker”, a burrito with over 20 possible ingredients including—paradoxically—tofu.
The dogs can be home-wreckers too, especially when they break the no-upstairs rule.  Sophie, for instance, crashes into doors.  Griffin has a habit of camouflaging himself in white blankets and pillows.  My uncle almost sat on him.
Above all, I’ve discovered that dogs are useful social tools.  Far more effective than mindlessly scrolling your iPhone, a dog provides endless iterations of distraction.  When conversation falters at dinner, just look down at your feet and baby talk, “Hiiiiiii, Sophie.  Aw, look at you licking your butt.  Awwwwwwwwww.”

Washington, D.C.—As a self-professed “Scandal” fanatic currently interning in D.C., I can’t help but try and connect my experiences in the nation’s capital to those of Olivia Pope (the character played by Kerry Washington who solves political controversies). But Olivia Pope tackles high-profile government scandals, whereas I’ve just been sitting in a cubicle all day making edits to a website. Living and interning in D.C., however, is not without a few small-scale scandals of its own. Here are some of the ones I’ve encountered over the past two weeks.
Scandal #1: Tanning on the National Mall
The problem: Sitting inside an office all day offers an excellent escape from the D.C. heat. At the same time, it also ensures that you remain as pasty as you were during the brutal Boston winters.
The solution: Tan on the National Mall. You will get some uncomfortable stares from hundreds of tourists, but take comfort in the fact that people (a.k.a. me) have done it before.
The verdict: Participate in this scandal at your own risk.
Scandal #2: Being “That Intern”
The problem: Where do I begin with this one? “That Intern” is the person at work who thinks they are a full-time employee. They interrupt a conversation with other interns by saying, “Excuse me, I have a potential contact on the phone. I have to take this call”, and then proceed to fire off phrases like “Well, all of us at (insert company name here) are committed to blah blah blah”. Dude. I just can’t.
The solution: The best way to solve this problem is to avoid “that intern” whenever possible. More importantly, avoid being him or her.
The verdict: Steer clear of this scandal. No one wants to be the subject of employee (er, intern) gossip.
Scandal #3: Inter(n)-Office Dating
The problem: Olivia Pope would actually know all about this one (affair with the President of the United States, anyone?). Apparently most companies aren’t too happy about flirtation in the workplace.
The solution: Keep it professional, guys. We all know that single interns in a big city are full of raging hormones and sexual tension, but for the love of God at least save it for the bar after work. Besides, in a city full of powerful people, chances are you can aim higher than the intern in the adjacent cubicle.
The verdict: Avoid this scandal and keep it in your pants until the weekend.
More scandals to come…
xoxo from Washington

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
HarvardX, the University’s branch of the online learning venture edX, this month announced its roster of new fall courses, including the platform’s first offering that will initially be open exclusively to Harvard students.
 
The 11 announced courses range from a Harvard Kennedy School class to online versions of several popular General Education courses. A 12th HarvardX course, the first from the Graduate School of Education, will open for registration this summer and start in January 2014.
Proponents of HarvardX have long emphasized the value of massive open online courses, or MOOCs, as an opportunity for Harvard to share its teaching on a free, broadly accessible platform and improve pedagogy in the traditional classroom. But Katie L. Vale, interim course development manager for HarvardX, said that HarvardX’s interest in MOOCs is part of a larger effort to be innovative with teaching.
 
“I'd say within HarvardX, we're thinking about MOOCs really as only one facet of the types of things that we're interested in doing,” Vale said.
 
To this end, two of the new HarvardX offerings are “small, private, online courses” called SPOCs. One of the offerings, GSD1.1x: “The Architectural Imaginary,” is open only to incoming Design School students but may be opened up to the broader public at a later date, according to Vale. The class will run as a module this summer to prepare incoming students for coursework in an on-campus component of the class this fall.
 
HarvardX’s first SPOC, a Law School course titled HLS1x: “Copyright,” debuted in January. Law School professor William W. Fisher, III, and his teaching staff chose from 4,100 applicants worldwide to form the 500-student online class. There are plans to offer “Copyright” again online in 2014, according to Nathaniel Levy, project manager at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society who helped develop the course.
 
Other new HarvardX courses include HKS211.1x, “Central Challenges of American National Security, Strategy, and the Press: An Introduction,” a Kennedy School module SPOC that will have limited enrollment for certain features, such as discussion boards. An online version of the Gen Ed course Science of the Physical Universe 27: “Science and Cooking: From Haute Cuisine to Soft Matter Science,” SPU27x, is set to debut in October with open enrollment.
 
EdX’s first courses went live last October, and two of the seven available were from Harvard. At the time, MIT and the University of California, Berkeley, also offered online instruction through edX. The free, nonprofit virtual education platform now boasts 28 member institutions and has enrolled roughly one million students.
