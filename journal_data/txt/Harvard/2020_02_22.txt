After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Up 61-60 with less than a second left, Harvard just needed to successfully inbound the ball in order to clinch the win. Having had blunders on the final possession against both Yale and Brown this season, this was its chance for redemption.
In typical Ivy League fashion, Princeton stole the inbound pass, and sophomore guard Jaelin Llewellyn attempted a three-pointer to try and steal the game from the Crimson. To the relief of the sold-out crowd at Lavietes Pavilion, Llewellyn’s shot missed right and Harvard narrowly escaped with a victory.
In another nerve-wracking finish, the Crimson (16-7, 6-3 Ivy) preserved its undefeated home streak against the Tigers (11-11, 6-3 Ivy). But in what was a grueling back-and-forth matchup, it was the relentless second-half play of sophomore forward Mason Forbes that made the difference.
“I just want you to know that we don't win this game tonight at all without Mason Forbes,” coach Tommy Amaker said. “I just thought that his spirited play off the bench energized our team. He made It was tough around the rim with the blocks he had, and just made just big plays when we needed it. I’m really proud of him.”
Playing a season-high 22 minutes, Forbes finished the game with 11 points, 7 rebounds, and 4 blocks and had a team-high plus-minus of 9. The Folsom, Calif. native scored crucial baskets for Harvard down the stretch including the layup that would give the team its first lead in the second period.
While Forbes’ scoring would ignite the Crimson offense in the second half, it was his defensive prowess that proved to be the key difference in the game. With Princeton having the ball with just under twenty seconds left in the game with a chance to take the lead, Forbes came up with the game-saving block that would allow Harvard to hold on for the victory. His fourth block of the game was indicative of his defensive awareness throughout the contest.
“I was really focused on staying engaged, especially locked in on defense,” Forbes said. “So when I saw that Llewellyn had beat our guy I was just ready to step over and get it. And I’m always staying ready to make those plays for our team. Coach really put emphasis on doing the little things and I felt that those are some things I was able to do this game to help us win.”
Forbes was the anchor of a stellar defensive performance from the Crimson as a whole. Harvard had 10 blocks as it limited the Tigers to just 34 percent shooting from the field and 28 percent shooting from three. Being able to stifle Princeton’s offense was integral to halting any momentum it gained during the game,
“We were trying to stay in front of the ball as best as we can,” senior guard Christian Juzang said. “And it makes it a lot easier when our bigs are beating stuff on the backboard, so you know that backline eventually stepped up for us tonight and made a lot of big plays down there. So that was a big help for us in stopping Princeton’s runs. “
Despite a great defensive effort, the win did not come easy for the Crimson. In a game that saw Harvard shoot 15 percent better from the field than the Tigers, it was Princeton that led for the majority of the game. The Tigers were able to stay in the game because of their ability to create second-chance opportunities off of offensive rebounds and the Crimson’s poor execution from the charity stripe. Princeton had 14 second-chance points while Harvard shot 4-of-13 from the line.
“They were just doing a good job of going and get their own misses,” Amaker said. “They did a nice job of taking advantage of that and we did a poor job awesome looking to block out the shooter.”
An offensive bright spot for the Tigers was sophomore guard Jaelin Llewellyn who scored a game-high 22 points. He helped Princeton seize the early momentum by scoring 12 points on 5-6 shooting in the first eight minutes of the contest.
“He was tremendous tonight and especially in the first half,” Amaker said. “I thought that we did a poor job of initially guarding him. With good players and good scorers you have to really make it difficult for them early. And when they get anything easy early, the game changes, and it was obvious that happened right after he got that first layup on the very first possession.”
Nevertheless, after his hot start, the Crimson stepped up its defense and held Llewellyn to just 10 points on 3-of-13 shooting for the rest of the game.
Harvard looks to make it ten in a row at home tomorrow night when it faces Penn at Lavietes Pavilion at 7 pm.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
CANTON, N.Y. — Ahead of Saturday night, the Harvard men’s hockey team had not claimed four points on its North Country road trip since 2016-2017. It had a prime chance to overwrite that fact, as it had already pocketed an impressive win against No. 5/6 Clarkson the night prior.
But the No. 20 Crimson (12-9-6, 10-5-5 ECAC) fell to St. Lawrence, 6-3, despite the wide disparity between the squads’ conference rankings.
With the upset victory, the Saints (4-24-4, 2-17-1) picked up just their second ECAC triumph and, amazingly, their first win at Appleton Arena this season.
“The hungrier team was on the other side of the ice,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “We had talked pretty extensively as to what we were going to see: a proud group of seniors on senior night…. We expected them to come out with some emotion and energy and passion, and they did. Quite frankly, we didn’t respond to it very well.”
For the Crimson, the disappointing setback ends a 10-game winning streak against St. Lawrence dating back to Feb. 20, 2015.
From the opening puck drop, the Saints controlled play with their physicality and sustained offensive-zone pressure. Fast-forward to the final five minutes of the second period, and St. Lawrence sophomore Kaden Pickering found twine for his team’s fourth tally.
Harvard failed to break the puck out of its zone cleanly, and the shifty forward took advantage, beating Crimson net-minder Mitchell Gibson (5 GA, .839 SV%) on a follow-up chance.
“I don’t think that the final score is something that we can say we deserved better [than], because we didn’t,” coach Donato said. “We got outplayed. They had more chances, more passion, and for us to think anything else would be foolish.”
An overwhelming first 40 minutes from the Saints, punctuated by Pickering’s game-winner, proved too much to recover from. Harvard made things interesting in the third period, though.
Down 4-0, the visitors potted a powerplay goal five minutes into the final frame, courtesy of freshman forward John Farinacci’s wrist shot from the slot.
After a quick response from St. Lawrence, the Crimson once again trimmed the deficit to three scores. Junior forward Henry Bowlby slid a turnaround shot low on senior goaltender Daniel Mannella (3 GA, .900 SV%).
Harvard’s greatest sign of life in the third came after freshman defenseman Ryan Siedem’s shorthanded tuck. Junior centerman Jack Badini found a crashing Siedem from behind the net for a tap-in.
With two and a half minutes to go in regulation, coach Donato pulled Cameron Gornet (0 GA, 1.000 SV%), who replaced Gibson after the Saints’ fifth lamp-lighter, for the extra attacker. But the comeback effort ended there.
“We knew we had to push, no matter what the scenario was,” Crimson captain Nathan Krusko said. “We were able to continue to grab some momentum. I thought our third period was resilient…. We did make a strong push, but at the end of the day, you can’t dig yourself that big of a hole and expect to get out of it.”
The Saints stung the Crimson in the first minute of the game. After a keep-in at the blue line and effective cycling along the wall, junior forward Callum Cusinato fed sophomore Andrew McIntyre from behind the net. McIntyre bumped the puck past the left pad of Gibson to stun the heavily favored visitors.
The ice-breaker was emblematic of St. Lawrence’s formidable performance, in which it threw both shots and bodies at the Crimson. And the Saints were not finished doing damage in the frame.
An oppressive offensive-zone shift culminated in sophomore forward David Jankowski cashing in on an exhausted five Harvard skaters. Jankowski’s third of the season cued the roars from within Appleton Arena, as the hosts mounted an early two-goal lead on a ranked opponent despite entering the contest in dead last in the Pairwise rankings.
“We knew they were going to come out hard,” Krusko said. “We were just hesitant and slow to get to our game. We had a lot of guys expecting someone else to make the big play…and that showed out with our tough and slow start.”
So, St. Lawrence punched the Crimson in the mouth early and continued its dominance through the second stanza.
Overall, its six goals on Saturday represent a season high. And despite the Saints’ lackluster record in 2019-2020, the hometown crowd was raucous upon witnessing its only victory on familiar ice this year — on senior night no less.
Harvard’s loss soils the emotional high of Friday’s statement win over the Golden Knights. The program, still with its eyes on a top-four finish in the ECAC, will close out its regular-season slate at home next weekend.
