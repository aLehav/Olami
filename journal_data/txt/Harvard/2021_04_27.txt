After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following their Chopin-themed recital in March, the Harvard Piano Society put together another recital on April 9. This event showcased the diverse talent of Harvard students — including an appearance from a graduate student at the Harvard Kennedy School — with performances of Beethoven, Schubert, Kapustin, and others. This Spring Recital took place on Zoom, where students were challenged to emulate a typical concert setting, either presenting a prepared recording or performing live from wherever they were.
The program began with a performance from Arav V. Karighattam ’23, playing the Allegro from Beethoven’s “Piano Sonata No. 1 in F minor, Op. 2, No. 1.” When finished, the audience took to the chat and reaction functions to applaud and congratulate Karighattam for his performance.
The next performer presented was Keita Takemura (HKS ’22), who played Alexander Scriabin’s “Etude in F minor, Op. 42 No. 7” and the Andante from Leoš Janáček’s “In the Mists.” Takemura said that though he’d been bummed by the virtual setting of the recital, he ultimately found this recital to be more rewarding than expected.
“Before the concert, I thought the performance should be relaxing. Since I won’t see the audience in person, I can play in my room, I can play with the piano I got used to. However, after I started playing, it was [more] nerve-wracking than expected since I felt the audience behind the Zoom,” said Takemura.
Forrest G. Flesher ’21 changed the tone with an intense performance of Nikolai Kapustin’s “Eight Concert Etudes, Op. 40 No. 3: ‘Toccatina.’” A veteran to the Piano Society, Flesher found beauty in the virtual performances as he reflected on his four years participating in the Piano Society.
“Figuring out how to make the music sound beautiful even with a poor audio quality has been a very rewarding challenge, and I’ve noticed things in some pieces that I’ve never noticed before,” said Flesher. “This past year I’ve really learned to view playing piano as something I do for my own enjoyment rather than for performing and playing for others.”
Nearing the end of the recital, Felicia He ’24 and Catherine B. Huang ’24 both used the virtual setting to their advantage and presented pre-recorded performances of the first movement of Franz Schubert’s “Wanderer Fantasy in C Major, Op. 15, D. 760” and Frédéric Chopin’s “Ballade No. 1 in G minor, Op. 23,” respectively.
The spring recital closed off with César Franck’s “Prélude, Choral et Fugue, FWV 21,” pre-recorded by Lucas H. Amory ’24. Amory recreated an in-person performance, wearing performance attire and playing in a concert hall, providing a view of the full piano as well as some of the auditorium. This was also the longest performance, nearing 18 minutes. After the virtual applauding and congratulations, President of Harvard Piano Society Hyuntae Choi ‘24 gave closing remarks, thanking everyone for attending and welcoming attendees to stay behind and meet some of the pianists.
Choi revealed that keeping the Piano Society alive through the pandemic has been difficult, but is proud of how everything turned out. “While the past year has been difficult for all of us, seeing all of us persevere and continue to play the music we love through these times left me inspired,” said Choi. “Our pianists are so talented and dedicated, and I was especially impressed by the great diversity of works featured.”
A big proponent of keeping the arts alive at Harvard, Stephanie Troisi, Student Services Coordinator at the OFA, noted how heartening it was to see groups like the Piano Society find ways to keep their art alive. While it was difficult to coordinate with the majority of the community spread across the globe, Troisi noted that they have worked to meet equipment needs for various groups and have strategically planned out ways to safely open up music spaces for musicians on campus.
“The Piano Society has been a meaningful contributor to the Arts Community over a number of years and while its presence had been a bit quieter over the last few, to see it being brought back to vibrancy through these performances is heartening,” Troisi said.

ABC’s newest comedy, “Home Economics,” stars Topher Grace, Caitlyn McGee, and Jimmy Tatro and seemingly tries to tap into Topher Grace’s past sitcom success in his role on “That 70’s Show” but fails to reach the same level of excellence. The show has its merits, but ultimately comes across as a lackluster attempt to provide hyper-relevant comedy and levity for 2021.
“Home Economics” follows a trio of siblings as they go through adulthood, focusing on each of their struggles while also bringing to light their individual successes. Tom (Topher Grace) is a struggling middle-class author married to the well-off lawyer Marina (Karla Souza). Sarah (Caitlyn McGee) is a working-class woman married to Denise (Sasheer Zamata) who has just been laid off. Lastly, Connor (Jimmy Tatro) is a wildly successful money manager living in (as is often mentioned) Matt Damon’s former house on the San Francisco Bay.
With such a stellar cast, the show seemed primed for success and laugh-out-loud watchability, with actors who had starred in “That 70’s Show,” “Grey’s Anatomy,” “Modern Family,” “How to Get Away With Murder,” among others.
This take on family drama has the tone and rhythm of a flopped sequel series that a network airs for a season or two, similar to the “Knight Rider” reboot in 2008 and “The Chevy Chase Show” in 1993 which failed dramatically — both pulling well-known talent but falling flat.
In the “Home Economics”’ premiere, the moments that try to be funny end up being uncomfortable, and the moments that try to be serious are slow. The entirety of the premiere is a seemingly unending string of poorly executed bits and distasteful physical comedy; a trip-and-fall gag and later treadmill bit only come off as flat. Even Topher Grace, stuck with uninspired writing and set-up, can’t make the one-liners and comedy land.
The show tries to stay modern with references to Covid-19, quarantining, and gender equality and inclusion. However, rather than coming off as contemporary and comforting as intended, the comments feel obtrusive. Furthermore, by making Sarah’s sexual orientation the center of many conversations without incorporating it authentically into the show, “Home Economics” felt that like it was attempting to seem contemporary but missing the mark on meaningful representation.
Another low point occurs when, on a video call, the siblings’ parents joke about Marina being Latina. The clumsy use of the trope of older white couples being unintentionally racially insensitive creates one of the worst moments of the episode. It comes off as abrupt and surprising, disrupting the tone of the show up to that point.
“Home Economics” is a poorly-crafted series that sadly wastes incredible talent. It could have been a poignant show about the struggles of the disappearing American middle class, but instead came across as poorly written and executed. Because this is only the premiere, however, there is hope that things can turn around and “Home Economics” can become another star like “That 70’s Show” or “How to Get Away with Murder.”

Pop, hip-hop, and R&B artist Doja Cat released a music video to her newest single “Kiss Me More ft. SZA,” and the internet ate it up. According to Pitchfork, this is the first single released in what is set to be Doja Cat’s third studio album, “Planet Her,” coming this summer.
Following last month’s music video release of Doja Cat’s “Streets” as a response to the viral red light silhouette trend on TikTok, Doja Cat and SZA deliver yet another one of this season’s hottest videos. Shot under eternal sunset skies with broad strokes of peach pink, this music video is a unique depiction of lust and desire in its most playful form. Doja Cat does it all — from complex costuming, hair and makeup, to stunning CGI visuals.
The video follows an astronaut, played by actor Alex Landi — best known for his role as Dr. Nico Kim in the hit TV show “Grey’s Anatomy” — after he crash lands on “Planet Her.” If the video is an innuendo to a sexual encounter between a man and a woman, it makes sense that Landi takes on the role of a recently crashed astronaut to a largely uncharted planet: Sexual partners are visitors to women’s bodies, and should be treated according to the rules of the planet.
Shots of singing and dancing Doja Cat and SZA, who are the rulers of said planet, are interspersed throughout. Together, the fluidity of their bodies to a seemingly improvised dance draped in pink mesh on a bed of pink silk sheets is mesmerizing.
After losing connection with Earth, the astronaut rows through one of Planet Her’s rivers, encountering islands upon which other-worldly versions of Doja Cat and SZA sit, creating the silhouette of mountain ranges. The astronaut comes across a large island in which a vibrant pink-painted Doja Cat sits, luring him in. After trying to convince himself he’s only just seeing things, the astronaut encounters a second island with larger-than-life figures of Doja Cat and SZA, clad in textured mesh suits. He stops to marvel at the ethereal beings, while Doja Cat delivers the perfect melodic rap verse in an orange jumpsuit and headwrap.
Not long after, SZA sits on an island of cherry blossom trees dressed in a two-piece bikini made of flowers. The Neo-Soul and R&B artist serenades viewers with not only the bridge of the song, but with her ethereality, too.
The astronaut makes it to a portal shaped like lips and enters by eating fruit off a nearby tree, likely an elude to a sort of “love potion.” He wakes up in bed with Doja Cat and SZA, with the video featuring a montage of the trio’s escapade. The astronaut then glitches into oblivion after falling for Doja Cat and SZA’s seduction. These cunning rulers have conquered yet another earthly being who endeavored to explore Planet Her’s shore uninvited.
The final part of the music video shows the pair casually playing a video game that resembles the exact narrative of the astronaut’s journey. Through clever dialogue and the pair’s hilarious delivery, it is conveyed that Doja Cat and SZA, the rulers of Planet Her, collect the bodies of men from Earth, similar to the astronaut, who are only pawns in their video game.
There is something to be said about the role reversal that Doja Cat plays with in this video, asserting that women can get exactly what they need from a male sexual partner and leave him as that if she so chooses. This iconic video for “Kiss Me More” treats sex with a sort of levity, that sex is to be enjoyed by women, and that it is the female body that should be kept sacred. Women are thus granted a sort of agency, or a permission of agency, to take the reigns of their sexual relationships with men.

How does Marvel try to hype up a film that has been delayed three separate times? By releasing yet another trailer with only slight additions, flashback scenes from previous films, and a new version of the Avengers theme music overlaid with choral singing. Surprisingly (and perhaps, unfortunately), it works.
The Marvel Cinematic Universe’s newest “Black Widow” trailer, though not revealing much more than prior teasers, is excellently crafted. It opens with an aerial view of Budapest, the city famously alluded to in “The Avengers” as a site of Hawkeye and Black Widow’s shared history. There’s a Natasha Romanoff (Scarlet Johannson) voice-over hinting at Black Widow’s many lives as the trailer shows her carefully navigating the city. The narration carries over a montage of Black Widow’s many moments fighting with the Avengers, featuring scenes from “Avengers: Age of Ultron” and “Captain America: Civil War” flitting across the screen before culminating in Black Widow’s tragic end in “Avengers: Endgame” — released exactly two years ago today, April 26 — where she sacrificed herself to save her found family of fellow superheroes.
The trailer then shifts back into the events of the upcoming “Black Widow” film, with the titular character falling out of the sky and landing in a sea of adversaries while sporting a new all-white suit, a stark contrast to her normal stealth getup.
There’s also flashbacks to Romanoff’s childhood, which feature a first look at Red Guardian (David Harbour), the comic and tragic Russian super-soldier. Finally, in perhaps one of the most anticipated MCU additions, Natasha finds Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh), a sister-figure to Natasha from her past. Scenes of Yelena and Natasha being chased by the film’s main villain, Taskmaster, are interspersed with sneak peaks of the Red Room, the program responsible for training Natasha along with a slew of spies also referred to as Black Widows.
This pursuit scene is followed by a traditional Marvel trailer element: a quick tour through the action-packed clips that “Black Widow” promises, including characters skydiving out of exploding planes, leaping over buildings and through windows, and an aerial fight between Black Widow and the Taskmaster, who has been creepily instructed to “bring [Natasha] home.” Cue a red-and-black animation of Natasha walking down a hallway, the “Black Widow” film logo, and the new version of the “Avengers” theme for a final bout of excitement. The updated release date of July 9 flashes across the screen before the trailer cuts to black.
“Black Widow” has been one of the most highly anticipated solo MCU films of the past decade. The first murmur of a Black Widow film came in 2004, and the development of this particular story began in 2017. However, considering the fact that this movie comes as a flashback in the MCU canon, and that fans know Natasha meets her end in “Avengers: Endgame,” there’s a critical question of what exactly this film will offer besides beautiful visuals and energetic action scenes.
For the continuation of the MCU, the most important thing slated for this film is the passing of the Black Widow mantle from Natasha to Yelena. Furthermore, with Natasha declaring that she’s “done running from [her] past,” this trailer suggests that the movie will offer viewers plenty of backstory into one of Marvel’s most mysterious heroes. Lastly, since we know Natasha’s ending, this film will give a window into the growth Natasha undergoes that propels her through her time with the Avengers, hopefully adding more depth and gravity to the multi-film narrative arc of the beloved Black Widow. With more than enough reasons to watch, “Black Widow” is well equipped to become a certified summer blockbuster.

Following a lackluster year for the hip-hop industry, rappers Young Thug and Gunna released the instantly legendary album “Slime Language 2” on April 16. Its setlist features all-stars like Drake, Meek Mill, Future, Lil Uzi Vert, Lil Baby, Travis Scott, and more. Just like Captain America assembling the Avengers to save the universe, Thug’s dream team lineup on “Slime Language 2” has single-handedly revived the rap game.
The album is a sequel to “Slime Language,” the 2018 solo compilation album from Thug’s label Young Stoner Life. Although the first album also featured fellow signees Gunna and in-house producers like Wheezy, YSL has risen to greater heights with “Slime Language 2.” This time, up-and-coming artists like Yak Gotti, Lil Duke, and Lil Keed are put on the same platform as established icons like Nav, Big Sean, and Skepta. The resulting album gives voice to all of the talent in the scene — underdogs and top dogs alike.
“Slime Language 2” has a whopping 23 songs, with the majority of top singles near the top of the record. These hits consecutively follow the intro track, “Slatty,” which has Yak Gotti and Lil Duke rapping about getting money and riding around in sports cars. This track sets a hype mood with its heavy beats and reworked treble sonics. That sound and concept follow through to the second track, “Ski,” which also broadcasts Gunna and Thugger’s rise from the streets to lavish lifestyles. This theme of rags to riches is fully expanded on “Diamonds Dancing,” where Travis Scott joins Thug to reminisce about how far they came from the trenches (“the trap to be specific”) where they started. Scott’s contribution doesn’t end at the lyrics — his trademark autotuned sound also seeps into the framework of the sample after his verse begins with “In your city.” That lyric is echoed in the outro, “My City,” bringing the album full circle. The production keeps these tracks steady, with a repetitive but uptempo beat that is dominated by the more versatile verses.
“Came and Saw,” “Really Be Slime,” “That Go,” and “GFU” put more emphasis on the drugs, money, and gang-affiliated lifestyle. While YNW Melly talks about “committing them crimes” and Rowdy Rebel restates “twenty-five shooters in a Sprinter,” Yung Kayo claims “I turn that ten into hunnid bands,” and Meek Mill responds with “hoppin' in whips and ridin' it stolen.” This might be due to the fact that the collaborators Rowdy, YNW Melly, and Meek Mill are in fact notorious for their gang affiliations, which they rap about on these tracks. There is an intensity to the hard-hitting bars from producers like Sheck Wes, aided by Thug and Gunna’s ad libs, that matches the spitball energy.
That hype fades into a more chill and melodic sound that follows through to the subsequent star-studded tracks. Drake raps about escaping his illustrious lifestyle by hiding away in London on “Solid” — a nod to his “Scary Hours 2” album, which also offers a similarly introspective outlook. Likewise, Future — another long term YSL collaborator — adds his take on “Superstar” about how fame gets more dangerous as it escalates. Lil Baby reminisces about how he carried the whole gang “in verts and Rovers” to glory on “Paid the Fine.” Meanwhile, Thug and Lil Uzi express how proud they are of each other in “Proud of You.” Mellow flows and unrushed tempos strip these songs of the intensity of the intro, leaving space for the features to truly shine. The thematic camaraderie of these songs also highlights the overarching commentary of “Slime Language 2:” Genuine friendships and family relationships are often tested — and strengthened — by the difficulties that come with the jet-setting nature of a rapper’s career.
Just like the album artwork suggests, “Slime Language 2” celebrates family above all.
The segue from longtime friends to first-time collaborators transitions the album into rookie territory. Unfoonk gets emotional in “Real” as he sings about his rocky rise to fame and contrasts that with his current loyalty to the Slime gang. Thug fondly echoes that sentiment as the CEO of “everything slime.” Soon after, Thug’s fiance Karlae croons about “waiting all [her] life” for a partner like Thug in “I Like.” This romantic mood all but vanishes in “Trances,” where Karlae’s flow is more complex and follows a call-and-response format with Yung Bleu’s autotuned chorus.
Then comes a series of hidden gems: “Warrior,” “Pots and Pans,” “Take It to Trial,” and “Wokstar.” These tracks are pure genius, harmonizing 808s and high-pitched vocals over a complex and ever-changing beat. Hints of synths, strings, and flute balance the hard-hitting bass line that producers Wheezy, Chase Davis, and Sluzyyy execute perfectly.
The album’s intentional fusion between household names and young Atlanta talent caters to the mainstream while also representing the entire YSL family. However, “Slime Language 2” accomplishes this by packing too many songs into one album, at the cost of songs with rookie features like “Moon Man,” “Reckless,” and “Como Te Llama” getting lost towards the end. Therefore, the top-down approach works against the newer artists trying to break through, as the listener is too tired by the end of the album to pay much attention to them. This left many fans wishing for a shorter record to be able to fully appreciate the album.
Be that as it may, “Slime Language 2,” without a doubt, follows through on its main mission to highlight its features — even though Thug doesn’t rely on them to carry the album. On the contrary, Thug dominates on virtually all songs and ingrains his influence in the production of every track. His voice is also more present than that of his collaborator, Gunna, emphasizing his role as the keystone that glues both the framework of the album and the entire YSL family together.

With a single dose of a suspicious new psychedelic, it can be any time period a user desires in Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead’s mind-warping sci-fi thriller “Synchronic.” Released in the United States on Netflix on April 16, “Synchronic” oscillates between twisted imagery and unexpectedly funny one-liners, successfully toeing the lines of sci-fi, thriller, and comedy. However, despite succeeding in racing minds and raising heart rates, a lack of character construction and narrative continuity leaves “Synchronic” viewers with more questions than answers.
“Synchronic” follows the lives of New Orleans-based paramedics and lifelong friends Steve (Anthony Mackie) and Dennis (Jamie Dornan), as they respond to progressively weirder incidents related to the usage of a new designer drug labeled Synchronic. In quick succession, Steve is diagnosed with a likely terminal brain tumor, Dennis’s daughter Brianna disappears after taking Synchronic, and the two have a blowout fight over Steve’s apparent drug addiction and Dennis’s self-absorption. A majority of the movie is centered around the aftermath of Steve realizing the drug’s time traveling capabilities, as he commits to taking the doses himself until he can find Brianna and return her to the present.
Conceptually, “Synchronic” feels like a hopeful younger cousin sitting in the shadows of other critically acclaimed mind-bending works like Christopher Nolan’s “Inception,” or his later film “Interstellar.” Although its combination of distorted realities and psychedelics is not a distinctly original idea, a dedication to the time-travel narrative through phenomenal period costuming helps “Synchronic” stand on its own.
The best aspects of this chronological interpolation stem from the wardrobe variety of costume designer Laura Cristina Ortiz. Responsible for creating costumes ranging from American Civil War attire to Ice Age garments, Ortiz’s wardrobe decisions successfully create a cohesive and convincing narrative regardless of the fragmented nature of time travel. Steve’s time travel outfit — consisting of a simple Carhartt jacket and muted beanie — contrasts noticeably with the more eccentric attire of the characters he interacts with in each alternate reality. Unlike the chilling white robes of the KKK or the massive mammoth fur draped over the prehistoric man Steve meets, the simplicity of his outfits ground viewers in an otherwise fantastical series of events.
Aside from costuming, another reminder of reality peeks through the comedic elements brought by Mackie and Dornan’s sincere performances. As a duo, Mackie (“The Falcon and the Winter Soldier”, “The Night Before”) and Dornan (“Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar”) are no strangers to delivering comedy. Perhaps unexpectedly, they bring this lighthearted energy into the otherwise dark narrative of “Synchronic,” easily softening moments of tension because, as Steve points out after returning from an almost fatal time jump: “The past fucking sucks.”
For all of its entertaining factors, “Synchronic” falls short in two major areas: character building and continuity. From its onset, “Synchronic” fails to give sufficient background on Steve and Dennis’s relationship and their individual character dynamics. While Steve becomes the central focus during time travel scenes, Dennis’s thoughts, motivations, and depth go largely unexplored. Consequently, it’s nearly impossible to feel invested in the film’s two major conflicts: the preservation of Steve and Dennis’s friendship and the return of Dennis’s daughter, Brianna. Without this, viewers are left wondering why they should care and whom they should care for.
Narratively, there is also a certain level of confusion: What are the rules of Synchronic-induced time travel? As Steve chronicles his journeys, he determines that to a certain extent rules do exist — a traveler has seven minutes in their respective time reality before they need to return, objects and people can be transported between periods through touch, and a traveler cannot make physical contact with living things from other time periods when the window to that reality closes. However, the film’s ambiguous conclusion works against these previously established guidelines, transforming the ending from merely thought-provoking to genuinely puzzling.
Although occasionally difficult to follow, “Synchronic” is a fairly entertaining and intriguing combination of sci-fi, thriller, and comedy — it’s worth watching, as long as you don’t think about it too much.

On April 17, the K-pop group BTS streamed a series of virtual concerts as a sequel to their first Bang Bang Con event in 2020. This virtual concert received massive viewership, surpassing 2.7 million simultaneous viewers globally. With this impressive accomplishment under their belt, BTS have streamlined a new form of interaction with their fans in the now largely contactless world of entertainment.
The event started with a telecast recording of the Seoul concert “BTS Live Trilogy Episode I: BTS Begins.” This concert was originally held over the course of two days in 2015, featuring songs from the albums “2 Cool 4 Skool,” “O!RUL8,2?,” “Skool Luv Affair,” and “Dark & Wild.” The event began with some throwback pictures to the boys’ middle school days, throwing their fanbase (ARMYs) down the nostalgic deep end. It then flashed forward to BTS’s debut in March 2013, bringing the boys together to their rookie days. Some other highlights included a hip-hop style dance battle between lead dancers Jimin and J-Hope, the premiere of the song “Converse High” in anticipation of their next album “The Most Beautiful Moment in Life Pt.1,” and some call-and-response bonding time with ARMYs during “If I Ruled the World.”
All in all, this concert showcased BTS in all of their rookie glory. Over the course of the show, it became clear just how hard the boys themselves had worked — blood, sweat, and tears, they left it all on that stage. What they lacked in confidence and personal development back then was filled by a feverish determination to succeed without any guarantee of success. Way before Grammys performances and Billboard records became a reality, all BTS had were a whole lot of smokey eyeliner and a dream to be great.
The next streamed event was the 2019 5th Muster Magic Shop in Busan. A BTS muster is a fan festival that usually happens every year with skits and fanservice for ARMYs. This special fast forwards the boys four years into the future, after BTS had added the following albums to their discography: “The Most Beautiful Moment in Life Pt. 2,” “The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever,” “Wings,” “You Never Walk Alone,” “Love Yourself: Her,” “Love Yourself: Tear,” “Love Yourself: Answer,” and “Map of the Soul: Persona.” Much had changed for the Bangtan Boys after this leap forward in their music, including topping various global charts, winning their first Daesang at the 2016 MAMA awards — and then 22 more over the span of the following three years — and performing at the 2019 Billboard awards.
The fanmeet begins with the statement, “The Magic Shop will be your guidance,” addressing the concertgoers as well as ARMYs all over the world with a message of hope. In that spirit, the concert takes off with the song “2! 3!” — an oath of hope to fans that the boys performed on a circular stage with ARMYs surrounding them on all sides. That communal spirit continues throughout the show, with special performances of RM’s “Trivia: Love” interlude during tea time, healing therapy magic shop skits, and hilarious music video footage of “Spine Breaker.”
As a whole, this concert shows the new and improved BTS. That means less dancing and more singing for the vocal line (Jin, V, Jungkook and Jimin), with members Jin and V getting more line distribution than in earlier albums, as well as more verses for the rap line (Suga, RM, and J-Hope). The sound is also new and improved, with more of a laid back R&B and pop sound as opposed to the hip-hop heavy emphasis in their earlier works. However, there are also a couple of throwbacks to their rookie days, with unchoreographed performances of “Jump” and “Ma City.”
It’s safe to say that six years after their debut, BTS no longer doubt their success but instead utilize it to cater to their newly developed strengths.
The group put their newfound skills to use in the final event of “Bang Bang Con 21,” the “BTS World Tour Love Yourself: Speak Yourself” concert in São Paulo, Brazil. This stadium tour was an extension of their “Love Yourself” World Tour in May of 2019. Flocked by larger-than-life lions and a fleet of backup dancers, the boys start off the concert with high energy performances of the EDM genre songs “Dionysus,” “Not Today,” and “Wings.” This time, there is a greater emphasis on pyrotechnics and LED lights that came after six years of being professional performing artists. In addition, this concert features solo performances from each of the members that caters to their individual tastes and strengths. Evidently, BTS’ self-confidence grew as they matured, leading to larger-than-life aesthetics and impressive stage presence.
Brazillian ARMYs have a special place in BTS’ hearts, spurred by a long history of tours in South America. Giving back to São Paulo with this stadium tour is BTS’ thanks for their fans’ love, support, and energy. That mutual love and respect is evident in iconic solo performances like “Trivia: Just Dance,” which received loud fan chants of “J-Hope” as the rapper danced across the stage. Likewise, Jungkook showed his gratitude for ARMYs’ support through the lyrics in his ballad “Euphoria,” while Jin’s “Epiphany” performance had the entire stadium singing “I’m the one I should love.” All of these individual sentiments culminated into a powerful collective performance of the song “Mikrokosmos,” which served as the boys’ final love letter to Brazilian ARMYs — and to all the viewers of “Bang Bang Con 2021.”

Trigger Warning: Racist violence, Sexual violence, Infanticide
On April 9, Amazon Studios premiered the first season of its new horror anthology series, “Them.” Created by Little Marvin and executively produced by Lena Waithe, “Them” explores terror in America, with the first season focusing on anti-Black racism and violence. With its unyielding, never-ending depictions of racist violence and flat storytelling, “Them” is nothing more than an attempt to profit off of Black trauma in a post-”Summer of Racial Reckoning,” politically-charged, and socially-aware world.
“Them” tells the story of the Emory family, a Black family of four that moves from their small town in North Carolina to East Compton, California — an all-white neighborhood — during the Great Migration. The show documents the family’s first ten days in their new home as they face violently racist neighbors attempting to drive the Emorys out. Meanwhile, each member of the family is plagued by their own demons: matriarch Lucky (Deborah Ayorinde) by the memories of the violent attack that spurred the family’s move, father Henry (Ashley Thomas) by his guilt for not protecting his wife, eldest daughter Ruby Lee (Shahadi Wright Joseph) by her anxieties of being like her mother, and youngest daughter Gracie Lee (Melody Hurd) by her fear of her mother.
The one star that “Them” earns is in recognition of the actors featured in the show. While it is questionable why anybody would agree to play a role in this series, everyone who did works with the material remarkably well. The most standout performances come from Shahidi Wright Joseph (who also notably starred in Jordan Peele’s “Us” (2019)) and Melody Hurd, who are 15 and 9 years old, respectively. Despite being too young to even watch this TV-MA series, Joseph and Hurd are exceptional at their craft and believably portray the fear, sorrow, and, at times, violence that their characters feel and act out as they fight their demons, both supernatural and human.
Likewise, Deborah Ayorinde and Ashley Thomas not only share palpable chemistry as Lucky and Henry, but also bring much needed nuance to their characters. Both actors expertly depict the highs and lows of their characters as they both grapple with PTSD, trauma, and unbridled Black rage. Alison Pill also stands out in her role as Betty Wendell, the primary antagonist who makes it her life’s work to make the Emorys as miserable as possible. Pill’s ability to embody true, unrepressed hatred and play an unhinged, racist white woman is scarily believable.
Unfortunately, no amount of exceptional acting can save this show. What makes “Them” so unbearable in comparison to works that juggle similar topics, such as Jordan Peele’s “Get Out” (2017) or HBO’s “Lovecraft Country,” is the lack of nuance. “Them” is unnecessarily cruel and uncaring in its depictions of Black trauma, racialized violence, and gendered violence. Anti-Black violence is followed by sexual violence (or, at times, both occur simultaneuously), which is followed by more anti-Black violence. There are no neutral moments and definitely none of joy for the Emorys at any point in the show. The same goes for their white neighbors as well. The white characters’ lives revolve around being violently racist and the Black characters’ lives revolve around avoiding the white characters’ violence. Much like the Emory family, viewers are given no time to breathe during “Them,” as every second of every scene is designed to leave its characters and audiences on edge.
The depravity of “Them” is most acute in the show’s fifth episode. Entitled “Covenant I,” this episode brings viewers back in time to when the Emorys still lived in North Carolina, revealing the incident that spurred the family’s move to California. While home alone with her baby son, Chester, Lucky is visited by an unnamed white woman who — after singing a racist tune called “Old Black Joe” — asks Lucky to give over her son. When Lucky refuses, the white woman and three white men break into the house. What follows is deplorable to say the least. For thirty minutes, viewers are subjected to graphic scenes of Lucky being raped by one of the men as her baby son is put into a bag and thrown around by the other white folks until he is ultimately killed. There is no plot point, storyline, lesson, or moral that “Them” attempts to get across to viewers that can justify such a gruesome depiction of a Black woman’s rape and a Black baby’s murder.
The lack of care that “Them” shows in its depictions of anti-Black violence begs the question: Who is this show for?
Is it for Black audiences so that they can feel represented by the media? If so, why make it so traumatizing for us that many of us cannot bear to watch it?
Is it for non-Black audiences to sympathize with Black people and our history? For non-Black allies who watch the show to pat themselves on the back for not being as violently racist as the characters in the show while not actually grappling with the ways in which they uphold and benefit from systemic racism? The unflinching, gruesome nature of “Them” seems like it would only truly appeal to one audience: white supremacists who get to watch their racist dreams unfold on their TV screens.
It can be argued that “Them” is an accurate portrayal of the violent racism that Black Americans have faced for centuries, and still do today. But at a time when we can put on the news and see the trial of Derek Chauvin for the murder of George Floyd unfold or watch 20-year-old Duante Wright be shot by a white cop during a traffic stop, do we not have enough representations of Black trauma on our screens? At what point does creating a show like “Them” become less about depicting the truth of what we as Black people go through every day and more about profiting off of our trauma?
If you are even mildly considering watching “Them,” don’t. If you do watch the show, ask yourself if you’re actually watching it to educate yourself. This show does not just walk the line between horror and trauma porn; rather, it fully dives into the latter and makes no attempt to come back.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a creative remote move, the Harvard Pops have produced a new musical mystery podcast called “Popscast: Cereal.” The podcast, released in three installments from March 31 to April 1, invites the listener to step back onto a pre-Covid-19 Harvard campus to follow an amusing mystery following two main characters: Thea, a violin prodigy, and Seth, her trumpet-playing roommate. Thea and Seth embark on a quest to find Thea’s stolen special pre-performance cereal before her solo debut with the Harvard Pops. Thea and Seth’s quest brings them to all kinds of quintessential Harvard locations such as Lamont Library, Adams House, and the cemetery in Harvard Square. Along the way, the duo crosses paths with iconic Harvard figures such as Dean Khurana and Remy the cat.
The podcast’s witty plot is an ode to Harvard traditions, poking fun at social customs like Finals Club initiations and campus stereotypes: “Lamonsters,” for example, are students who become living zombies after studying for nights on end. The podcast’s dialogue is smooth: Eve E. Crompton ‘24 (Thea) and Thomas D. Kaminsky ‘24 (Seth) embrace their roles, delivering lines with gusto.
The quest for Thea’s cereal is paired with skillful arrangements played by the Pops, ranging in style from “The X-Files Theme,” “Thriller,” “Imperial March,” and “Saber Dance.” The last podcast episode features a phenomenal concerto composed by Harvard Pops’ Rachel Guo ‘22 and orchestrated by the music director of the Harvard Pops, Allen G. Feinstein ‘86. The concerto’s soaring solo violin lines transition into two dueling violin parts, performed by Skye G. Park ‘24 and Michael T. Pak ‘23 and supported by tasteful background instrumentation. Throughout the podcast, instrumentation accentuates the story and allows soloists to shine. It maintains a high level of rubato, balance, and dynamic variation, which is an especially laudable task to pull off without recording and practicing in person.
Overall, “Popscast: Cereal” maintains a wonderful balance of satire, plot, and outstanding music, resulting in a series that would make any Harvard student chuckle.

“Rilakkuma and Kaoru,” a stop-motion animated series released on Netflix in 2019, is only 13 episodes long, each with a duration of only around 12 minutes. For viewers accustomed to shows with hundreds of episodes, it might not seem like the ideal pick for a binge watch, but don’t let the bite-sized segments fool you. “Rilakkuma and Kaoru” is a breath of fresh air — a gorgeous show that takes an endearing look at the whimsy found in everyday life.
The show follows Kaoru, an office employee navigating work and love as she lives with three toy animals, including a bear named Rilakkuma who is a popular character in Japanese pop culture. This background may seem superficial — a cutesy setting to conceal a lack of substance — but that couldn’t be farther from the truth. “Rilakkuma and Kaoru” is beautifully thoughtful and shines in its honesty. Despite the adorable nature of Kaoru’s toy roommates, the show doesn’t depict her life as some impossibly happy experience. Instead, the wholesome adventures of her friends are juxtaposed with Kaoru’s struggles with loneliness and finances. In one episode, Karou’s furry friends overhear her worrying about money after a reduction in her winter bonus, prompting them to search for employment. In another, Kaoru fantasizes about changing her personality after hearing her co-workers chatting about not inviting her to their get-togethers. The realistic portrayal of adult life serves to ground the show, making the amusing activities of her toy roommates much sweeter in comparison.
“Rilakkuma and Kaoru” is a calming tribute to the ordinary, highlighting even the smallest moments of daily life — something reflected in the show’s animation. The stop motion was so painstakingly elaborate that it reportedly took an entire day for the production team to complete just ten seconds of footage, and it shows. The show is so charmingly detailed that it prompts the viewer to take in even the smallest aspects of Kaoru’s surroundings: the ruffles on her dress, the wood paneling on her dresser. Every set piece in the show is so textured that it reminds us to appreciate our own surroundings that we take for granted every day. This is where the show truly excels. It reminds the viewer that, despite the inevitable hardships one will face, life is ultimately beautiful and worth living. “Rilakkuma and Kaoru” is a comforting meditation on the mundane, and well worth a watch.
Season One of “Rilakkuma and Kaoru” is available on Netflix.

On April 6, New York rapper Lil Tecca released the music video for his newest single, “Show Me Up,” directed by Declan Kyle.
With the first notes of the song’s dreamlike melody, the video opens with a slowed shot of Tecca dressed casually in jeans and a black jacket, with his back turned to the camera. He looks out onto the ocean as a wave crests from left to right before crashing onto the sand. Beyond this, the frame is still, with the viewer left to focus on the dimming pastels of the sunset sky, its cirrus clouds taking on the shades of orange and pink that will come to define the video.
As Tecca’s name and the title of the song appear on the screen in elegant capital letters, the video switches to another slowed and very still shot of Tecca. This time, he strolls towards the edge of a cliff overlooking the beach and the accompanying seaside town, which slopes gently down the side of a steep hill to meet the water. Tecca is now wearing all white; his shirt is decorated elegantly with a dark paisley pattern, but one that at times appears gold in the soft late afternoon light. He wears this piece unbuttoned, unwinding to the sounds of his own hypnotic tune.
An abrupt cut to a close-up of Tecca accompanies the beginning of the lyrics to his song, which come off slow and relaxed. He dances to his music, and the camera now moves more actively to follow him. This switch reflects the pattern that the rest of the video will follow, with Tecca being shown in alternating close-ups and wide shots — some slowed, some played in real time — as he switches between the elegant and casual outfits that he wore at the beginning of the song.
As a result, Tecca appears in a timeless void, a luring and listless seaside dream. There is no plot at all in this video, and the wide shots in particular emphasize his solitude in this expansive and somnolescent locale. All in all, the physical and temporal distortion of the video are the perfect backdrop to the trance-like song that they are meant to represent.
But there is more to this video than its surreal depictions of its sole protagonist. In fact, there is a striking theme of duality interwoven into this piece. It is present in the contrast between Tecca’s two outfits, between the motion of the close-up shots and the serenity of the wider pictures, and between the lonely expanses of the beach and the cliff, where Tecca begins the video, and the luxurious resort in which he ends it. Even the timing of the video, which was shot at sunset — the brief interlude between the opposites of night and day — adds to this motif. Together, these elements reflect Tecca’s own duality as a musical artist, which is revealed in large part by this very song. Indeed, “Show Me Up” is lower in energy and has a very different feel than Tecca’s earlier hits like “Ransom,” “Love Me,” and “Did It Again,” even though the lyrics of the songs touch upon the same themes.
All in all, the viewer is left to think that there is more to Tecca than first meets the eye.

If you can’t get behind a team’s jersey, can you really get behind the team? Jersey design and color scheme can be make-or-break factors when it comes to engendering fan support — Harvard football, beige on a uniform? Really? The Arts Board has selected the best jersey from each of the U.S.’s five major sports leagues in circulation right now so that you can pick a favorite. Your sporty friends will be impressed by your arts and design opinions, we promise.
5. Orlando City SC’s “Thick ‘N Thin” Primary Jerseys
Kicking off our top five is America’s number one sport, Major League Soccer. I kid, I kid, soccer fans — there are plenty of exciting reasons to tune into MLS games, and Orlando’s purple threads might just top the list. Unlike in other sports leagues, MLS jersey designs are often obstructed by team sponsors’ logos. However, MLS is also unique in that teams’ primary jerseys are revamped every other year, and Orlando’s 2021 design proves that the right colors can carry a jersey. A rich and luxurious gradient of dark to light purple gives this kit a sleek look. Especially against a soccer field’s complementary shade of green turf, Orlando’s homage to its “unwavering and resilient fanbase” catches the eye with nonchalant elegance. I’m sure this is also what the players are thinking about every second of the games they play in.
4. The New York Mets’ Home Pinstripes
Major League Baseball uniforms also trend towards simplicity: Most teams embrace solid whites and grays with minimal highlights, while braver teams really put themselves out there and flirt with classic pinstripe designs. As much as I tease, I’d be lying if I said there wasn’t something kind of sexy about the Mets’ orange and blue pop. Effortless and flashy all at once, Mets jerseys simply feel fun — a rare descriptor in a sport bogged down by intrinsic sluggishness and centuries-old tradition. Do the Mets’ two World Series titles stack up to the crosstown Yankees’ twenty seven? Who cares. Orange and blue all the way.
3. The Los Angeles Chargers’ Color Rush Alternates
Now we’re starting to get a little funky. Between helmets with mascots and highlights on shoulder pads, National Football League jerseys have a touch more flare than those of the previous two sports leagues. Fully launched in 2016, the NFL’s campaign to pit colors against colors with the Color Rush uniform series has produced some gems, but none stand out quite like the Chargers’ royal blue paint jobs. The deep, suave background is paired with bright yellow accents in a marriage of primary colors that is simultaneously subtle and electric. And how could you ignore the addition of lightning bolts on the players’ leg pads? This jersey is a cheat code.
2. The Calgary Flames’ Throwback Alternates-Turned Primaries
Is it just me, or is it getting kind of hot in here? Wait, that’s just the Calgary Flames’ former throwback alternates being promoted to their primary jerseys as of this past National Hockey League season. Hockey sweaters — jerseys are called sweaters in hockey because that’s what players used to actually wear during games — are canvases for some pretty creative designs, but the Flames take the top spot in this league. It’s hard to go wrong with a classic red, yellow, and white color scheme, and the team’s fiery logo — simple yet impactful — rounds out a jersey that’s brilliantly no-nonsense. The Canadians win this round.
1. The Miami Heat’s City Edition “ViceVersa” Uniforms
Pink and blue gradient? Check. Black highlights? Check. Overall drip? Double check. The Miami Heat’s City Edition jerseys, part of a joint National Basketball Association and Nike campaign to honor fans’ and cities’ unique cultural and emotional backgrounds, riffs off the aesthetic of the hit ‘80s television series “Miami Vice” to put forward what is without a doubt one of the grooviest jerseys the league has ever seen. The team’s 2021 spin is the final uniform in the City Edition series set to employ the Vice theme, and it’s quite possibly its best yet — smooth and playful, vibrant and commanding. These jerseys belong in a museum.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The history of white supremacy and slavery in America is being taught in troubling ways today – from textbooks in Texas leveraging subtle euphemisms that label slaves as run-of-the-mill “workers,” to New York classroom activities asking young Black students to reenact slave auctions in front of their white peers. Unhelpful and traumatizing practices like these are not only pernicious, but commonplace: Only 8 percent of high school seniors can identify slavery as the central cause of the Civil War, and members of this Editorial Board can point to their own inappropriate K-12 experience in which teachers – adults – thought it appropriate to have students “play” slavery.
In an aim to shed light on these dark and warped educational practices, Harvard Medical School recently hosted a talk with researcher Donald Yacovone to discuss his research and upcoming book, both of which are centered on the white supremacy embedded within the education of young American students.
The schoolroom lessons that we are taught from our wee kindergarten days onward have lasting consequences for how we think about race in our society today, and fundamentally shape, affirm, and regulate our societal norms and behaviors. To that end, when American history – as taught in school curriculums today – plainly excludes vital elements of African American history, or sanitizes the dark underbelly of the American empire, a white supremacist value judgment is being made and stamped into our perceptions of what stories should be embedded within the American consciousness; whose histories deserve attention, and who counts as a true American.
Yacovene’s research is deeply valuable, and we appreciate that space was made for this conversation within Harvard's virtual halls. Yet facilitating this dialogue is no slam dunk. Harvard itself is not at all above the issue of white supremacy and Eurocentricity in education.
After nearly half a century, Harvard still has no ethnic studies department. We have previously expressed our frustration surrounding the College’s lack of an ethnic studies concentration, despite the 12 formal proposals for one presented to Harvard, and the Eurocentric bent of flagship Harvard curricula such as the Humanities 10 course series. We continue to remain disenchanted by this noxious, conscious lapse.
Harvard also continues to perpetuate the issues that Yacovone’s work highlights through its haphazard departmental choices and policies. Indeed, in departments that actually do begin to center decolonial academic practices aimed at undoing white supremacist norms, such as History and Literature, instructors are often hired on short-term limits that restrict their capacity to contribute to the long-term intellectual communities of their departments. Furthermore, Harvard simply doesn’t hire many faculty members with academic interests in ethnic studies, nor does the College retain such scholars. In fact, there have been droughts lasting up to six years in which Harvard’s social science departments have gone without Latin American and Middle Eastern history professors – yet, of course, Harvard has seen no shortage of American and Western European history professors.
The ramifications of this dynamic are cutting and widespread. Most fundamentally, the lack of robust academic programs through which to study race, ethnicity, and power at the University have distortedly defined what Harvard, as an institution, regards as valuable and worthy of exploration. And inevitably, this missing academic space and dearth of resources also threatens to cultivate a culture of insensitivity and disregard for issues of race and ethnicity within academic study at Harvard. Indeed, this came to roost just earlier this year, when Harvard actually entertained the notion of offering Engineering Sciences 298R: “Data Fusion in Complex Systems: A Case Study” – a now-redacted course that, if launched, would have had undergraduates engage in policing a majority-minority city without any incorporation of race within its pedagogical framework. Whether intentional or not, instances like these tacitly signal that robust considerations of race can be trivialized and swept away in academia where desperately needed. Especially when this development is considered in tandem with Harvard's strikingly low rates of tenure for professors of color, a damning narrative on the treatment of the perspectives of people of color within Harvard’s scholarship begins to take shape.
Harvard has to recognize when it's throwing stones from a glass house. If the University is truly interested in unpacking how white supremacy infects academia, there remains endless work and personal reckoning to be done. Indeed, at the very least, the University should actively seek to ensure its existing educational materials don’t deepen the hole in the ways Yacovone’s work points out. And, if they haven’t done so already, Harvard faculty should work independently to update their assigned textbooks, readings, and lecture notes to reject racist value judgments that may tip the scale on what is and isn’t included.
Inevitably, Yacovone has helped to spark a necessary conversation on the role of white supremacy in education, but Harvard’s placement within this broader dialogue will remain largely performative in the absence of any real institutional introspection and change. The University has a significant role to play in education; not only does Harvard educate its own, but it also produces many academics who go on to create the works from which later generations learn. Against this backdrop, Harvard must ensure that its students do not walk forward with institutional racism built into their backbones.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Keys. ID. My bag.
I pace in the doorway of my dorm room. What else am I forgetting?
Mask.
I wear a mask everywhere I go. With the current pandemic, most of us don’t enter the outside world without a piece of fabric covering our faces, revealing only our eyes and nothing more.
My first semester at Harvard College was a memorable one, regardless of how far from “normal” it was. I met new people, made new friends, took challenging courses, traveled to new places, and found a home on a campus far away from the life I had left behind. It took me one semester of college to realize, however, that I wore a mask long before the pandemic had started.
I wore a mask when I spoke to a professor, my demeanor professional and polite while maintaining eye contact and trying desperately to understand her words, hiding the feelings of confusion and helplessness.
I wore a mask when I spoke to my mother, smiling through the fatigue and stress, reassuring her that I am doing okay and that I had not skipped dinner that night as I stared at my unfinished work and untouched meal.
I wore a mask when I spoke to my friends, laughing and joking around carelessly, burying the emptiness and sense of alienation in the back of my mind, so I could temporarily forget how alone I truly feel.
I wore a mask when I stepped into the outside world because I was — and in some ways, still am — unsure of who I am and where I belong. I drifted from crowd to crowd, memories slowly fading into a blur, experiences becoming just split-second encounters, just another name and face and piece of information that takes a place in the vast archive within my mind.
My mask was more than just the piece of fabric I now pull over my face every day. It was a facade that I had built, a disguise that not only concealed my outward appearance but my identity, my emotions, my thoughts. The real me.
But I am tired of wearing this mask. And it took me time to realize that I can remove my mask because I am the one who decides to put it on. I can deconstruct this disguise because I am the one who built it and only I know the pieces that must be disassembled.
So now, when I speak to a professor, I let my voice waver and my hesitation show. I take off my mask and expose my distress and sense of misdirection, and she guides me, leading me back to the right path.
When I speak to my mother, I let my smile disappear and my exhaustion overwhelm me. I take off my mask and reveal that I am drained, and she comforts me, encouraging me to move forward and reminding me of my goals and aspirations.
When I speak to my friends, I allow my emotions to be known — the happiness, the sadness, and the in-betweens. I take off my mask and they still accept me, concerned for my well-being and making certain that alone is the last thing I feel.
Sometimes we get so caught up in the process of creating these masks that we don’t realize the harm we inflict on ourselves: casualties of a never-ending battle to hide while struggling to be seen and heard at the same time.
By stripping off my mask, I have gained an appreciation for the complexities and subtleties of my identity. I’ve realized the value of self-expression as I continue to connect with the world around me, and as I learn who I really am and what I am capable of.
We all wear our own masks. But sometimes it takes wearing an actual, physical mask to realize that maybe it's okay to take off the masks that are less visible.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School’s International Human Rights Clinic published a report condemning state-sanctioned massacres in Haiti on Thursday.
The executive summary of the report, which HLS co-published with the Observatoire Haïtien des crimes contre l’humanité, describes the acts of state-sanctioned violence under the presidency of Jovenel Moïse as probable “crimes against humanity” when considering their “scale, pattern, and context.”
At least 10 “brutal attacks” have occurred in areas of the capital where resistance against Moïse’s administration is prominent, the report states. The authors describe three attacks — which took place in La Saline in November 2018, Bel-Air in September 2019, and Cité Soleil between May and July 2020 — as “particularly well-documented and severe.”
“These three attacks offer insights into the means and methods used to carry out the assaults, and the ways in which state actors have supported the orchestration and execution of attacks,” the report reads.
Nathalie K. Gunasekera, a third-year student at the Law School and author of the report, said a key motivation of the report was to provide a more “accurate” representation of the attacks and “influence” the narrative of state culpability.
The mainstream media outside of Haiti often depicted the violence there as “pure gang-related violence or inter-gang fighting,” Gunasekera said.
Joey Bui, a third-year student at the Law School and author of the report, said a “really important angle” of the report was that the attacks occurring in Haiti were not incidental, but rather motivated by governmental actors.
“It may be easy for people to almost dismiss the violence in Haiti just because of this stereotype that Haiti is a violent country,” Bui said. “It’s not just random violence, this is state-sanctioned violence.”
The report argues it is “crucial” Haitian officials hold those complicit in the attacks “responsible for these crimes.”
“Accountability is critical to supporting rule of law, but also to ensuring an end to the grave human rights abuses that have placed Haitian communities in a state of terror,” it reads.
Bui said her project team at HLS — which at the time was beginning to research remedies for victims of cholera in Haiti — investigated the subject after receiving a request from human rights groups in Haiti.
“It was a really urgent situation, and the lawyers on the ground in Haiti had so much to deal with at the time, and didn’t quite have the capacity to look into crimes against humanity,” Bui said. “And there’s this added aspect that some Haitian human rights lawyers and civil society members had been threatened.”
Beatrice Lindstrom, a clinical instructor at the International Human Rights Clinic and author of the report, said that while there have been “thorough and courageous efforts” led by members of Haitian civil society to document the attacks, she believes the issue had not received adequate global attention.
“We haven’t really seen the human rights crisis in Haiti get the level of international attention that one would expect given the brutality of these attacks,” she said.
Nixon Boumba, a Haitian human rights activist and author of the report, said the publication has been “well-received” by the Haitian public, and is challenging the conventional relationship between civilians and their government.
“This report is trying to innovate, and to push the line with strategic litigation and to change the behavior and change relationship between the state, the ordinary citizen, and the action of the government,” Boumba said.
Boumba said he hopes to disseminate the report more broadly to make it “more useful” for Haitian people, particularly those who are marginalized.
“They are talking about, ‘We need justice, we need to be able to participate in the designing of our future,’” Boumba said. “We’re trying to push for justice throughout this report — I think it’s something very important, impactful, and powerful for us.”

Helena Buonanno Foulkes ’86, a former corporate executive who has held top positions at CVS Health and served as CEO of the Hudson’s Bay Company, will serve as the president of Harvard’s Board of Overseers for the next year, the University announced Monday.
The Board of Overseers, which is made up of alumni who are elected in slates of five to six-year terms, is the University’s second-highest governing body. P. Lindsay Chase-Lansdale ’74, a developmental psychologist who recently stepped down as the vice provost for academics at Northwestern University, will serve as the vice chair of the Board’s executive committee, the school announced.
The Board was previously chaired by entrepreneur and computer scientist R. Martin Chávez ’85 and women’s health physician Beth Y. Karlan ’78.
The announcement comes in the middle of the voting period for the 2021 Board of Overseers election, which features 11 candidates running for five open seats on the Board. The Harvard Alumni Association Nominating Committee put forth eight candidates for election, and three additional candidates backed by Harvard Forward — a student and alumni organization working to call attention to climate action and racial justice issues within the University’s governance boards — qualified for the ballot through a petition process.
Last year, the University moved to limit the number of candidates able to serve on the board who qualify for the ballot via a petition process, instead of selection by the HAA’s nominating committee. The change, which came after three Harvard Forward candidates were elected to the board in Aug. 2020, caps the number of petition candidates at six. If the three candidates backed by Harvard this year are elected to the Board, no alumni may join the ballot through petition until 2026.
“Helena Foulkes and Lindsay Chase-Lansdale have each been insightful, admired, and valued members of the Board these past five years,” University President Lawrence S. Bacow said in a press release. “The combination of Helena’s experience in guiding large and complex organizations through periods of change, and Lindsay’s experience in a central academic leadership role within a major research university, promises to serve the Board and the University well.”
During her time on the Board, Foulkes previously chaired the committee on finance, administration, and management and participated in committees focused on natural and applied sciences, inspection, and governance. As the director of the National Bureau of Economic Research and a board member for various nonprofit and for-profit organizations, she has been listed in Fortune magazine’s annual ranking of the most powerful women in business four times.
“I feel incredibly fortunate to be part of the Harvard community and will do all that I can to help in these challenging times,” Foulkes said in a press release. “President Bacow, working alongside the governing boards, and the administration, faculty, students, and alumni have been amazingly resilient in this last year, and my Overseer colleagues and I will do our best to help guide the University through this next chapter.”
Chase-Lansdale chaired the Board’s committee on schools, the college, and continuing education. Her priorities as Northwestern vice provost for academics included promoting faculty diversity and supporting students of color and first-generation and low-income students. She said in the press release her tenure as the Board’s vice chair will focus on “addressing inequities in the academy and in society.”
“I am deeply honored to serve as vice chair and to collaborate with President Bacow, Provost Garber, the Harvard leadership, and my colleagues on the Board of Overseers to foster even greater excellence at Harvard,” Chase-Lansdale said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
U.S. Chief Medical Advisor Anthony S. Fauci discussed the current state of the nation’s response to Covid-19, as well as where the country goes from here, during a virtual town hall event Monday with the Harvard School of Public Health.
Moderated by Axios Health Editor Sam Baker, the discussion featured Karen B. DeSalvo, chief health officer of Google Health, YouTube director and global head of healthcare and public health Garth N. Graham, and HSPH professors Michael J. Mina and Mary T. Bassett. This event is the first of a three-part series on the current state and future of the pandemic hosted by HSPH, entitled “COVID-19: A Dose of Reality.”
HSPH Dean Michelle A. Williams said during the panel she is hopeful based on the success of the vaccine rollout so far, but acknowledged the significant obstacles still facing the nation in tackling the pandemic.
“Right now, I’m only cautiously optimistic,” she said. “Why? Because we’re in a race against fast-spreading variants and vaccine hesitancy, because we’re grappling with the politicization of vaccines, and because we are running up against misinformation and persistent societal inequalities.”
Upon welcoming the five panelists, Baker posed questions regarding the country’s next steps in combating the remaining issues of the pandemic.
Fauci noted the importance of an efficient and effective vaccine rollout during what he termed a “precarious” stage of the pandemic before the U.S. can reach herd immunity.
“That’s going to be a while before we get there, but that doesn’t mean we’re not going to have a significant diminution in the number of infections per day, and a significant diminution in all the other parameters — namely hospitalizations and deaths — before we actually reach herd immunity,” he said.
To continue tracking the spread of the virus, Mina added it is “absolutely essential” to make Covid-19 tests widely available and convenient to the general public.
“To this point, still, we have barely seen any adaptation in our regulatory pathways to ensure that there's accessible and equitable testing that is giving results in a timeframe that's actually commensurate with what’s needed for this pandemic,” Mina said.
Mina said the development of inexpensive, rapid self-tests can help encourage compliance with testing.
“If you make these tests as accessible as your toothbrush, people will test themselves,” he added.
According to Fauci, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will soon release updated guidelines for mask-wearing and other scientifically-backed, “common sense” public health measures.
The panelists also addressed how the subject of public health commanded the attention of a worldwide audience throughout the course of the pandemic.
According to DeSalvo, the collaboration between public and private sectors was crucial in disseminating information to the public and mobilizing what she described as an “extraordinary” response to the pandemic. She added this is especially notable given the long history of underfunding of public health infrastructure in the country.
“It's going to take all of us, not only in this pandemic, but also going forward to make sure public health has the tools and the strength to continue to protect the public,” DeSalvo said.
The panelists also touched on the pervasive issue of health inequity both within and beyond the pandemic.
“We know that people's jobs, where people live, their ability to take sick leave, their ability to take time off, to go get vaccinated, to make their schedules flexible — all of those are related to inequities, which have meant that people of color in the United States have been more likely to get infected, more likely to be hospitalized, and more likely to die of Covid-19,” Bassett said.
“That's true today as it has been for the very early months of this pandemic,” she added.
Fauci said he believes the nation should continue addressing health disparities as the country moves forward.
“It almost has to turn around — what we have to admit which is true — the deep profound racism that has brought us to this point over so many, many, many years,” Fauci said. “That’s the thing we really got to get that spotlight on and don’t let that spotlight get dim when we’re two years out from the outbreak.”
Though he acknowledged the challenges that lay ahead, Graham argued the pandemic response opened a window to demonstrate society’s fundamental need for public health to the nation.
“I will say that it is an opportunity for us to continue to think about collectively how we move forward and empower communities, empower individuals, and really make this issue of public health really public, and out of the silos of our journals and textbooks and into people’s hearts and minds,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said in a Friday interview that the College is preparing for the unique challenges of returning to a full campus this fall and is considering ways to support students in their transition to residential life.
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay announced last month the FAS is “expecting a full return to campus” and a return to in-person learning in fall 2021. The news was met with relief from many students.
Khurana said the College aims to invite all students to live on campus this fall and hold all courses in person.
“Our goal is to return to in-person instruction,” he said. “I think it is only prudent that we continue to plan for contingencies, but our plan is to return to full in-person education for all of our classes.”
Still, Khurana said the fall will not constitute a complete return to normalcy.
“This is going to be a transition year. This upcoming year — it’s going to be an adaptive year,” he said. “I think it would not be honoring the loss if we sort of just said, ‘2020 didn’t happen, and 2021 didn’t happen,’ and that we didn’t have lessons to learn from it.”
This past year, Harvard invited freshmen to live on campus during the fall semester and juniors and seniors to live on campus in the spring. Those plans left out most sophomores, who spent the academic year away from campus.
Gay said in an interview last month that her “greatest disappointment” regarding planning this academic year was excluding sophomores from the College’s residential plans.
“If there is a single great kind of regret, it would be that sophomores have had to stay off campus for this long,” she said.
Khurana said Friday the College is considering offering specific programming to rising sophomores and rising juniors — who have yet to experience traditional life in upperclassman houses — before the start of the fall semester.
“We’re really thinking about this as reorientation,” he said. “Faculty deans are also working on different ideas about different ways to welcome not only their rising Class of 2024, but also students who, for the Class of 2023, have not had a chance to really live in their house.”
Khurana said in Friday’s interview that the College recognizes some international students will face a unique transition to campus life.
“We are already planning for, thinking about different ways of on-ramping and onboarding our international students — not only first-year students, but also rising sophomores — recognizing that many may not have been on campus yet,” Khurana said.
Though most freshmen lived in Harvard’s dorms last semester, federal visa policies barred international freshmen from coming to campus this year. Many said their first semester of college was marred by isolation, nocturnal routines, and insufficient support from Harvard.
Before they step foot on Harvard’s campus in the fall, international sophomores must first secure visas. Some of those students said they are concerned about making the transition to college life after spending their freshman year abroad and over Zoom.
“I won’t be a freshman anymore, but I’m still as clueless as any incoming freshman,” said Nika O. Rudenko ’24, who lives in Ukraine.
Wamalwa Ochieng ’24, who studies in Kenya, said he believes international sophomores would benefit from an orientation program — similar to the one Harvard provides international freshmen at the start of their college experience.
“An orientation program for incoming sophomores who are international will be of great importance because I don’t know once I get to the U.S. where to start,” Ochieng said. “I’d want a bit of a grace period for one or two weeks to ease into American culture, adjust to everything before actually starting classes.”
Though Harvard is planning to bring back all of its students to live on campus, Rosanna Kataja ’24, who lives in Finland, said the coronavirus pandemic continues to worry her.
“Going to live abroad for the first time in this pandemic situation — as if it wasn’t already stressful moving out to other side of the Atlantic — and then now, it’s like, what if Covid comes again and we have to go back home?” Kataja said.
In addition to managing the transition back to in-person learning, the College will also have to integrate an unusually large freshman class this fall. This application cycle, the College admitted a full class of students, who will join the 349 students accepted to the Class of 2024 who deferred their admissions.
Khurana said that though the large class size may present some “logistical challenges,” he believes having more students in the Class of 2025 will in fact benefit campus life.
“We all have an opportunity to transform as an institution and benefit from this talent,” he said. “Maybe things will feel a little bit more crowded and lines will be a little bit longer, but I’ll take that any day in order to have the full range of talent and just the sparkle that each student brings to this campus.”
For all Harvard affiliates, Khurana said the fall semester will mark a “psychological transition” after an unprecedented year.
“We want to have a very respectful way of allowing people to come back and integrate into the community in a way that feels healthy and right to them,” he said. “We’re mindful that, for many people, being in large groups is gonna be the first time they’re seeing people.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Human rights experts from Harvard Law School, Yale Law School, and the University Network for Human Rights published a white paper calling on the Biden administration to aid refugees escaping the effects of climate change in Central America on Thursday.
The white paper focuses on the Northern Triangle — a region consisting of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras — and the “large-scale migration” of civilians fleeing the impacts of a deteriorating environment.
Thomas B. Becker, an attorney at the University Network for Human Rights and a co-author of the report, said many legal experts decided to work together on the white paper because of the “interesting intersection” between immigration, asylum, and human rights law.
“This is more than environmentalism, this is more than just human rights, this is more than migration — all these things are intertwined,” Becker said. “When you compartmentalize them, you can’t have a holistic approach to addressing the problem, and this is why we had folks from across different disciplines involved in this.”
Deborah E. Anker, the co-founder of the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinic, said the report was written because the increase of climate change refugees was an “urgent problem” and “urgent challenge” that the United States helped create.
“The Northern Triangle has been in trouble for over a decade, for decades really, but it’s been intensified,” Anker said. “The U.S. historically has had a significant role in destabilizing countries and governments in that region, and we have a huge impact on climate change as well.”
James L. Cavallaro ’84, co-founder and executive director of the University Network for Human Rights and co-author of the paper, said the publication aims to “change the conversation” about migration and displacement “at the macro level,” especially when it comes to international culpability and responsibility.
“We’re in a situation where the United States has a historical, global responsibility for CO2 emissions and climate change,” Cavallaro said. “Along with responsibility for the causation of climate change comes a responsibility to remedy the consequences.”
A central motivation of the paper was to utilize “outside-of-the-box thinking” to present a “more permanent solution” to combat climate change, said Jeffrey S. Chase, a former immigration judge and co-author of the paper.
“To try and approach something new and change the government’s thinking about where this fits into asylum and climate change was just incredible,” Chase said. “It was a lot of work, but it just felt like such an incredible effort to be part of.”
Gina M. Starfield, a second-year at the Law School and researcher on the report, said the paper-drafting process began before the presidential elections. Starfield said that regardless of the results, the team believed their findings would be an important opportunity to “analyze the law” and “on the ground” situation in the Northern Triangle.
“We didn’t know what administration was going to come about and how receptive they would be but regardless, climate change issues are only increasing and the number of refugees, migrants and people fleeing these situations that could qualify for protection and could qualify for expanded versions of other forms of immigration relief is only growing,” Starfield said.
Camila Bustos, a third-year student at Yale Law School and member of the University Network for Human Rights, said that though the Biden Administration has taken steps to remedy climate change, lawmakers must continue to “creatively, critically, and humanely” develop solutions.
“It’s been really positive to see that they’ve taken some steps, but as with so many issues, we think there’s so much more that’s needed,” Bustos said.
Yong Ho Song, Archie Southgate Fellow Attorney and co-author of the paper, described the publication as “very timely,” especially given the urgency to develop solutions to help people suffering from climate change to “live with dignity.”
“We have a new administration that is very open to listening to what civil society has to say about how we think about helping these people who flee their countries due to climate change,” Song said.
John Willshire Carrera, the co-managing director of the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinic and co-author of the paper, said that the publication is a step towards “rebuilding the system” following the Trump administration’s asylum policies.
“So this was a very special moment to get up and start moving forward,” Carrera said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Boston Water and Sewer Commission chief engineer John P. Sullivan justified the BWSC’s plans to proceed with the controversial Harvard-funded North Allston Drainpipe Expansion Project in a virtual meeting with local politicians, Allston residents, and University representatives Monday.
Harvard has pledged to foot the estimated $50 million bill for the drainpipe expansion, which the BWSC said will enlarge the width of some existing pipes, add two water filtration machines, and direct stormwater through a new outfall into the Charles River.
This meeting comes after Massachusetts Secretary of Energy and Environmental Affairs Kathleen A. Theoharides certified the BWSC’s environmental notification form in March, which drew scrutiny from local residents and environmentalists concerned about construction and water quality impacts.
Despite the certification, the project faces substantial political hurdles. Due to the proposed outfall being on state parkland, it requires state legislature approval pursuant to Article 97 of Massachusetts’s constitution, but local politicians are reluctant to proceed, citing the BWSC and Harvard’s alleged lack of outreach. Monday’s information session was meant to serve as one step in such outreach efforts, Sullivan said in an interview in late March.
Sullivan opened Monday’s meeting by justifying the pipeline expansion, pointing to climate change and the resulting increased rainfall totals.
“You’ve got to remember that we have climate change occurring, and we do see increased rainfalls, and, anticipating that, we have taken this and made it a larger pipe for the future, so we can remove the water from your area,” he said.
“We cannot take the major storms until we get the major pipe installed,” he added later.
Sullivan acknowledged that, in order to construct the easement that would allow stormwater to flow into the Charles, the BWSC still needs to obtain nine forms of approval, though he identified the Article 97 approval as the primary factor preventing the project from moving forward.
“We’re really anxious to get the proper size pipes that were envisioned 105 years ago, to drain these neighborhoods — to do the right thing for the total drainage, and the anticipated climate change rainfall that we get,” he said, referring to plans from 1916 and 1917 for an enlarged drainpipe system that never came to fruition.
State Rep. Michael J. Moran — who along with State Sen. Sal N. DiDomenico expressed hesitation about granting Article 97 approval in a March letter to Theoharides — said during Monday’s meeting that he doubted the project was aimed at improving the lives of his constituents.
“If the problem is truly the flooding issue around the Allston community, then those people are ratepayers of [Boston] Water and Sewer, and I think their issues should have been dealt with as ratepayers — not as part of a bigger project that is undoubtedly going to benefit Harvard University the most,” said Moran, who represents the north Allston area impacted by the drainpipe.
Moran said he wants to make sure that this project is the “right thing to do.” He added that this meeting would be the “first of many,” during which he wants the voices of the “direct abutters” and of his constituents to be heard.
“I would rather stay focused on the areas that need help and the communities and houses that are in harm’s way. And I would like to stay focused on a way that we can help them most immediately,” Moran said.
Ed A. Kotomori, an Allston resident and member of the Harvard-Allston Task Force, said parts of his neighborhood had flooded twice and needed to be “repaired immediately.”
“This neighborhood is not being taken care of, and I’m damn mad about it,” Kotomori said. “I think Harvard University has to step up to the table now and correct it.”
“We want it done as fast as possible. Otherwise our cooperation with Harvard will end. We’ve co-operated with them for 15 years,” he added.
University spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke wrote in an email following the meeting that the drainpipe project will “significantly improve neighborhood resiliency to storm events for thousands of residents.”
“More than 1,500 households in North Allston will directly benefit from this substantial upgrade to the City’s infrastructure,” she wrote. “Completing the construction of the remaining portions which allow the drain to reach the Charles River is reliant on Article 97 legislation, and will be managed in coordination with neighbors, City and State agency staff, elected officials, and the surrounding residential, business and University community.”

As Harvard prepares for a full return to campus for students this fall, the College is experimenting with in-person and hybrid courses to develop best practices for in-person teaching and learning.
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay first announced the trials in a December 2020 faculty meeting, noting that they would help the FAS “work through the logistics” of offering in-person instruction in the fall.
Rebecca N. Nesson, associate dean of the Harvard College curriculum, said in an interview that the College’s pilot program has two components: “full in-person teaching and learning with distancing and masks” and “hybrid teaching,” with students both physically and digitally present.
Nesson said 14 courses are participating in the trial, with a specific focus on classes especially disrupted by Covid safety protocols, including vocal music and lab-based science offerings.
“We really focused on doing a small and targeted pilot, where the intention was to make sure that we tested out the modes of teaching and learning that we felt were most impacted by moving online or would be most different,” Nesson said.
Matthew J. Liebmann, professor of American Archaeology and Ethnology, said teaching Gened 1044: “Deep History” in a hybrid model was “pretty seamless.” For two course meetings, Liebmann delivered instruction virtually while his co-instructor, history professor Daniel L. Smail, taught before a dozen students in Harvard Hall.
“We specifically designed some discussions that we knew would bounce back and forth between the in-person students who we called the ‘roomies’ and the online students who we called the ‘zoomies,’” Liebmann said.
Smail — who was stationed with the “roomies” — said he had to become familiar with Harvard’s HELIX technology, which allows online students to join a live classroom through large monitors.
“The students in the classroom were really good sports,” Smail said. “I remember on a couple occasions, they said, ‘If I want to talk to my classmates, where do I look?’ So we pointed out the camera.”
However, Ryan K. Low, a teaching fellow for the course, said he found leading a hybrid section “very, very challenging.”
“When they're all sitting in an amphitheater, and some of them are on a TV screen in the back of the room and watching what's going on from Zoom, that's really difficult for the TF who's running the section,” Low said.
Reshma Menon, a mathematics preceptor in Math Mb: “Introduction to Functions and Calculus II,” said although she was initially “a little bit nervous going into the first day of teaching in-person,” typical classroom dynamics came back naturally to her and her students.
“When I was in the actual in-person class, my students were much more willing to take risks or think out loud,” Menon said. “In a breakout room, students may be thinking out loud, but I can't really hear that.”
Menon said many of her students demonstrated enthusiasm for the in-person pilot, including one member of the section who recounted feeling “like a kid who's going to the first day of school.”
“I could see my students actually laughing and joking with each other when they wouldn't understand a problem or when they had made a mistake that they realized was a common error,” Menon said.
Kira G. Fagerstrom ’24, a student in Menon’s section, said she had “never done an in-person class as a freshman” at Harvard and was “super excited” to sign up for the in-person pilot.
“They kept the structure of a problem-solving-based class, but for our breakout rooms, we were actually like there with each other,” Fagerstrom said.
Sebastian L. Garcia ’24, who participated in an in-person section of Human 10b: “A Humanities Colloquium: From James Joyce to Homer,” said he was “really surprised” about how being physically present in the classroom “boosts your morale.”
“I know for a lot of us, it's been a year and a half since we've been in the classroom. So it's really surprising just how easy it is to get back in there and actually start talking and have a good learning experience,” he said. “It made me more excited to learn.”
Smail, the instructor for Gened 1044, said that it was “great” to meet his students in person for the first time.
“It's the two dimension to three dimension. I don't just mean the screen — I mean that you just start seeing them as people,” Smail said.
Michael Yin ’22, a student in English CKR: “Introduction to Playwriting,” said his classmates — many of whom are first-years — were “blown away” by having an in-person section.
“I certainly was nostalgic as well. It’s been so long,” Yin said. “This does give me hope that even if things aren't totally back to normal, even if we had to have some classes in this tent, I honestly wouldn't mind.”
Jasmine N. Adams ’24, another student in Menon’s Math Mb section, said her in-person section was a “subtle reminder” of the full college experience she hopes to have in the fall.
“I walked out of class almost in shock because it was just such a huge difference from online classes,” Adams said. “I've kind of forgotten how it felt to be in an actual classroom.”
Samyra C. Miller ’21, who participated in an in-person trial for TDM 119: “Vocal Production for the Stage,” said the University will have to exercise “creativity” to ensure spaces safely accommodate the arts as it prepares for a full return to campus next semester.
“They should really heavily consider how they're going to rework classes and also extracurriculars that involve the arts, like dancing, singing, acting, because those are also very important parts of the University,” Miller said.
Nesson said that she expects students to “regain appreciation and gratitude” for the classroom experience when they return to campus in the fall.
“It's going to be both very positive and a little bit overwhelming,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Observing its second Ramadan of the pandemic, the College’s Muslim community is celebrating with virtual programming and enjoying halal meals from Harvard University Dining Services — a new offering that resulted from months of discussion between students and HUDS.
Ramadan, the ninth month of the Islamic calendar, began on April 12 and will end on May 12. During this time — which marks a period of prayer, spiritual discipline, and generosity — observant Muslims fast each day from sunrise to sunset.
When observing Ramadan before the pandemic, Harvard’s Muslim community hosted open nightly gatherings with prayer and food in Lowell Lecture Hall. This communal feast is referred to as iftar, an evening meal that breaks the day’s fast and traditionally begins with eating dates.
These gatherings welcomed hundreds of guests — “not just Muslim students but students of all faiths across campus,” according to the University’s Muslim chaplain Khalil Abdur-Rashid. He described the lecture hall as “a beehive of conversation and food.”
“Muslim students would bring guests from their Houses, would bring faculty members, and people would eat, we’d have a large family meal together,” Abdur-Rashid said. He also noted that each night featured a different cuisine, and at the end of the festivities, leftovers were donated to a local shelter.
The pandemic, however, has thwarted the usual festivities for the second year in a row. Now, it is over Zoom that Muslim students attend nightly prayer sessions.
Reem K. Ali ’23, co-president of the Harvard Islamic Society, said Ramadan is a “little lonelier than usual” and “definitely harder” in its virtual iteration.
“Typically it is a time when people get together,” she said. “It's a lot harder with COVID and lockdown restrictions because you're confined to your room or suite.”
Bilal Wurie ’21 — a member of the Harvard Islamic Society — also pointed to the lack of face-to-face engagement as the “heart of the challenge.”
“It's really just those informal, casual moments that ground the community social dynamics,” Wurie said.
Ali said the Harvard Islamic Society’s leadership has sought to close the distance by checking in on their members more regularly and sending care packages, which included a prayer mat, prayer beads, and skincare products.
Muslim students pointed to another bright spot this year: after several months of consulting with student representatives, Harvard University Dining Services is now preparing halal breakfast packages for 82 students on campus during Ramadan.
These new Ramadan offerings are accompanied by a broader change at HUDS, which now serves a diverse weekly halal menu for its Muslim students. Before this menu expansion, Wurie said Muslim dietary needs were not fully met by HUDS, and that halal options “were limited to grilled chicken, essentially.”
“HUDS has really stepped up and done something quite phenomenal,” Abdur-Rashid said. “I'm also hoping that this will be a catalyst for Harvard University Dining Services to have a more robust diversification of their menu options for students that are having any religious dietary needs, regardless of religious affiliation.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Kevin F. Jura will serve as the next president of the Harvard Extension Student Association for the 2021-2022 term after defeating opponent Antjaun Finch in a runoff election.
Results were announced Monday on HESA’s election website after an additional week of voting to conclude the runoff election between the two candidates. Jura joins new HESA Vice President Vivian Okonta, who was elected last Monday after running unopposed.
This year’s election for HESA president was mired in controversy for the second year in a row. Just weeks before the elections were set to begin, new eligibility requirements were implemented, disqualifying at least one potential candidate from running for the position of president.
Kenneth “Ken” Downey, Jr., the outgoing HESA director of communications, told The Crimson last week that the Extension School’s Dean of Students Office was responsible for the changes, though Division of Continuing Education spokesperson Harry J. Pierre has repeatedly denied the DSO was involved.
As president, Jura said he aims to build unity among HES students and ensure transparency from HESA, especially in the election process.
“There’s no transparency in the election process,” Jura said. “There’s confusion on who’s actually making the decisions, whether it’s the DSO or certain members of HESA — everyone wants to say it’s the other person.”
“There’s no way of knowing, what is truthful, what isn’t. So that’s probably going to be my biggest challenge, trying to break HESA out from underneath the thumb of DSO,” he added.
The election changes imposed restrictions on the types of students eligible to campaign for office — barring ALB admitted degree candidates from consideration for the presidency and requiring candidates to have completed at least two full terms in their degree program. The restriction on ALB candidates was lifted, but the two-full term requirement remained.
Jura, an ALM degree candidate, nearly failed to meet the two-term requirement after completing his bachelor’s in the fall and starting his master’s program in January. Though he technically did not complete two full terms in his program of study as an admitted ALM degree candidate, he was granted permission to run after communicating with Mark A. Addison, a student affairs case manager in the Dean of Students Office who also serves as HESA advisor.
“There was no communication from either DSO or HESA. It was extremely frustrating, because there are friends, friends of mine that would have made great officers and great directors, but they were banned, and I had to get special permission even to run,” Jura said.
It remains unclear who enacted these changes, though HESA’s election website notes that the Election Committee “developed, reviewed, and agreed upon” the eligibility criteria, with Addison being listed as the contact for the committee.
Downey Jr. said the Dean of Students Office was responsible for the changes and referred to statements made by Addison during a virtual “Meet the Board” event posted on HESA’s Facebook page on April 14.
“HESA does not oversee any of the elections,” Addison said during the event. “They [HESA] don’t make any decisions with regards to elections.”
Despite being pointed to Addison’s comments, Pierre maintained that HESA elections are managed by HESA and denied involvement from the DSO, referencing a previous statement to The Crimson.
“HESA student elections are managed and conducted by students for students,” Pierre wrote in the previous statement. “This student-managed process is set up so that elections can be conducted in a transparent, fair and open manner.”
Downey noted that Pierre’s statement directly contradicts Addison’s comments in the video.
“That information that Mr. Pierre provided was false,” Downey said. “The HESA board, and all of its members, we had absolutely no say in the changes to the election.”
Finch also expressed frustrations with the election process after he was asked to alter his campaign statement to comply with a rule prohibiting students from campaigning on initiatives already being pursued by the DCE.
Finch initially campaigned for the removal of “in Extension Studies” from degree names — a change that students have pushed for for years. He dropped the matter from his campaign after being told by Addison that things are “‘already in motion.’”
“That’s another one of their vague rules, which is sort of [an] ongoing problem here,” Finch said. “I was told that I couldn’t even say anything about changing the name of the school, or trying to get that done because that’s a thing that they’re working on. I’m not sure that anyone but them, anyone but the administration was aware of that.”
Regardless of the controversy during the election process, Jura said he remains committed to working towards the goals and objectives expressed in his campaign video and plans to foster inclusivity.
“I want to work with everyone, and I want to congratulate both my opponents for running a hard, well-fought race,” Jura said.

One of the downsides of online learning (besides every single thing about it), is that it opens up a world of distractions. You are sitting in front of your computer, and as you start to zone out of the lecture, you decide to just open up another browser or go on your phone. The fact that it is so easy to get away with this makes it even easier to distract yourself. So, why not just embrace this newfound freedom and flex your multitasking skills as the semester comes to an end? (Fun fact: I wrote this article during one of my classes — talk about life imitates art!)
Work on a Paper
You know that 12 page paper you have to write for your GenEd class that you haven’t started yet? Yeah, the one that’s due tomorrow. Well, now is as good as time as any to get started on it. Don’t let your education get in the way of your, well, education. Use this time that you are forced to sit in front of your computer to try and see how many pages you can pump out in 75 minutes for that essay. You’ll be staring at your screen anyway so if your professor or TF glances at you, they will still see that same dead, empty look in your eyes staring at the camera as if you had been paying attention in class the whole time.
Use Your Phone
Chances are whenever you are in class your phone is somewhere close to you. We both know that you are itching to check who’s texted you or to take a quick scroll through Instagram. Why fight the pull when you can just embrace it and swap your laptop screen for your phone screen, especially since you are now much less likely to get caught being on your phone. You can try and hold your phone up to your laptop screen so that to everyone else you look like you are looking at your camera and not stalking your ex’s new boo on Instagram.
Online Shopping
With Covid rampaging the streets, you may not feel completely comfortable with hitting up your favorite stores and revamping your wardrobe. It’s a good thing we live in a world where you don’t have to go shopping when shopping can just come to you. Go ahead and check out those flash sales and max out your bank account. Not that it matters much anyway since you have nowhere to wear your cute new outfits because you’re in your room 24/7, but you could start getting an outfit ready for your first post-Covid soiree.
Play Online Games
We have all zoomed through the limited range of online games that exist during our Zoom socials. Sometimes desperate times call for desperate measures, so if you are looking for some form of entertainment, go back to the classics. If you want to heighten the experience, Zoom chat a friend to join you in a quick game of skribbl.io or even Among Us. There’s nothing quite like murdering your friends and random strangers on the internet in the middle of your physics class.
Read Flyby Articles
On the one hand, if you want to do some online reading, you could use this time to catch up on important current events, especially since so much has been going on in the world lately. But on the other hand, you could also open up Flyby and read about the Harvard Houses as Taylor Swift albums. I mean, that could also be considered an important current event, right? In my unbiased opinion, Flyby provides some of the best entertaining reading to get you through your 9 a.m. lecture.
Watch Netflix
For the risk-takers, tune into your favorite Netflix show during class. If you’re going to watch something on your laptop for 75 minutes, might as well make it entertaining. You might not want to hear the harmonious sound of your professor and the characters on the show speaking at the same time, so you will probably have to mute the show (...or the class). Fortunately, you have subtitles so you can read and follow along with your professor’s voice providing some melodic background music.
Will your grades drop? Probably. Will you end up confused about what’s going on in the rest of the course? Possibly. Will you walk away from class feeling refreshed and energized from doing something fun (excluding writing your paper if that’s not your cup of tea)? Definitely. Even though the benefits may outweigh the drawbacks, it might be best to tune into your lecture once in a while so you have some idea of what’s going on. You might as well get your tuition money’s worth!
