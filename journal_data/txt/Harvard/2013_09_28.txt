After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Only hours after an influential United Nations-affiliated intergovernmental organization declared that global warming is almost certainly caused by human activity, Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, told a filled room at the Harvard Kennedy School that she had “good news” to share about climate change. Figueres had a unique message for the eager audience members: the “good news” is “you.”
“In politics, you future leaders can advocate for climate policy and action,” she said. “In industry, you future leaders can protect the bottom line through climate action that minimizes risk and guarantees return. In science, you future leaders can redefine modern life through technological innovation that is adopted because it helps peoples’ lives.”
“You are the source of my inspiration,” Figueres said.
Figueres clarified early that her speech aimed not to reinforce the startlingly ominous facts surrounding global warming.
“The release of that report in Stockholm today is nothing less than an alarm clock moment for all of us,” said Figueres, referring to the the release of an official groundbreaking statement from Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change earlier Friday.
“I’m here to tell you that actually, I do believe there is good news on climate,” Figueres continued. “And I believe that not out of ignorant naivety; I believe it rather out of my profound conviction that the opportunities offered by addressing climate change substantially outweigh the costs of addressing climate.”
In addition to acknowledging close familial ties to the University through her father, a former president of Costa Rica who served as a visiting professor at Harvard in the 1960s, Figueres made clear that she chose to speak at the Kennedy School to address the best and brightest of today’s youth.
“I firmly believe that I speak to students here in this room who are the future leaders of politics and policy, of industry and academia, of science and technology,” Figueres said. “There is leadership power in each one of you and this is the truly great news.”
Figueres, a native of Costa Rica, was appointed to her current position by Secretary General of the United Nations Ban Ki-Moon in May 2010. Kennedy School professor Robert N. Stavins said her “pragmatic leadership of what is an extremely challenging set of negotiations” sets Figueres apart as a leader.
In an interview after the event, Figueres told The Crimson that as she nears retirement age, she can now reflect back on her influence in the world of climate change policy.
“I think my greatest contribution is to open up the space of possibility and to show that yes we can do this,” Figueres said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An unidentified aggressor assaulted and robbed three women on Thursday night, according to an advisory released by the Cambridge Police Department on Friday.
“These incidents are particularly troublesome because the victims were assaulted during the robberies,” CPD spokesperson Daniel M. Riviello wrote in an email to The Crimson.
The first victim, a female in her twenties, was assaulted at approximately 10:15 p.m. “in the area of Appleton Street,” according to the CPD advisory. The victim reported feeling a blow to her head and then having her cell phone stolen.
The second incident occurred at approximately 10:45 p.m. near Kirkland and Holden Streets. Two females in their twenties stated that an aggressor approached and then knocked them to the ground before taking the cell phone of one of the victims.
Riviello wrote that, at this time, CPD believes the two incidents may be related, and wrote that the department is actively investigating the robberies. Currently, the suspect is believed to be male and acting alone.
Harvard University Police Department distributed the CPD advisory to the Harvard community via email Satuday afternoon.
“We are aware of the robberies and have stepped up our patrols in the area of Harvard Square,” HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano wrote in an email to The Crimson.
Riviello wrote that anybody who has information about the case is invited to contact CPD.

EDITOR’S NOTE: Sept. 28, 2013
An emailed breaking news alert circulating this article Saturday afternoon included as its header the text “Watertown Shootings.” In fact, there were no shootings associated with the assault and robbery of three women in Cambridge Thursday night. The heading, erroneously included in Saturday’s breaking news alert, referred to the Watertown shootings connected with the manhunt for the Boston marathon bombings suspect last April.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A week after Harvard broke San Diego’s 13-game home winning streak, the Crimson extended its own Harvard Stadium streak to 14 in its Ivy League opener against Brown.
After trailing the Bears in the first quarter, 13-0, the Crimson came back with 31 unanswered points on its way to a 41-23 victory.
In his first start at home, junior quarterback Conner Hempel impressed once again, finding five different receivers for double-digit yardage and ending the day with 296 yards and one touchdown through the air.
At the end of the third quarter, Hempel, under pressure, found senior wideout Ricky Zorn for a 63-yard score, his longest of the season, to put Harvard up, 38-20.
“I saw a better Hempel today,” Brown coach Phil Estes said. “He’s a hell of a quarterback. He’s got great feet. When you give him that much time, he can make plays.”
The Crimson defense found ways to pressure Bears quarterback Patrick Donnelly all night, sacking him three times and intercepting him another three times. Junior cornerback Norman Hayes, who intercepted the San Diego signal-caller to ensure the win last week, picked off Donnelly with 5:17 remaining in the game to clinch victory No. 2.
“We like getting pressure on the quarterback,” said junior defensive end Zach Hodges, who sacked Donnelly once and also tallied an interception. “It’s something we really like to do. We like to get in their face, we like to get physical, and if you don’t want to come back at us, we’ll come at you.”
Against a Bears first-team defense that shut out Georgetown last week, Harvard found the end zone five times, scoring on all but one possession after the first quarter, the final drive ending in a kneel-down notwithstanding.
The Crimson defense, which topped the league in stopping the run last year, struggled to contain Brown tailback John Spooney, who tallied 110 yards and two scores. But Harvard did come up with a key stop after a pass interference penalty gave Brown first and goal at the two, with Brown down, 38-20, in the fourth quarter. Senior defensive end Austin Taylor wrapped Spooney up in the backfield on third down, forcing the Bears to settle for a field goal.
“We like the fight and we felt good going into this game,” Hodges said. “It kind of also feels good when our coaches know that we had the type of game we had and they’re still confident in us. They understand that we know what we need to do. Last year we had trouble making plays when we needed to, and this year we’re not.”
On Harvard’s first drive, Hempel drove the team quickly down the field, but a pass intended for senior tight end Cameron Brate ended in the hands of Brown linebacker Xavier Russo in the red zone.
The Bears capitalized off the interception and marched 76 yards down the field before tailback John Spooney ran in for a score.
The Bears attempted a trick two-point conversion that they couldn’t convert off of their first score, but the ensuing kickoff caught the Crimson off guard when it was an onside kick. The short field ended with Donnelly finding tight end Brian Strachan in the back of the end zone to put the Bears up, 13-0.
But once the second quarter began, the momentum shifted. Hempel was 6-for-7 for 110 yards in the second quarter and led the team on scoring drives on each possession. Hempel and Stanton each had 1-yard scoring runs to give the Crimson its first lead of the game.
“[We] get off to a little bit of a sluggish start,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “We had a good drive coming out, throw the pick, get behind the eight ball, 13-0, I thought the kids showed a little bit of resiliency, got in a rhythm in all phases and just managed to get control of the game.”
The Crimson defense notched a touchdown for the second consecutive week when the ball bounced off of a Bears receiver’s hands and senior safety Jaron Wilson took it back 51 yards for a score. Harvard piled on some more on its next possession when Stanton found the end zone off of an option play with less than a minute left.
Early in the third quarter, sophomore linebacker Eric Medes pressured Donnelly into making an errant throw, which Hodges picked off, but Harvard was unable to turn it into points.
With sophomore running back Zach Boden out with a knee injury, sophomore Paul Stanton carried the bulk of the rushing plays for Harvard, netting 91 yards and two scores.
Despite entering halftime with a lead for the second game in a row, Harvard once again lost the time of possession battle in the first half, holding the ball for only eight minutes before halftime. Penalties also plagued Harvard all night—the Crimson ended up with 12 infractions for 89 yards, one of which brought back a 60-yard kick return.

State police have reported that an unidentified aggressor stabbed a person Saturday night in John F. Kennedy Park, according to an emergency alert sent to the Harvard community by the Harvard University Police Department at around 8:30 p.m.
The alert reported that the victim appears to have known his or her assailant but is not providing information to law enforcement officers. The case is now under investigation by state police, Cambridge Police Department spokesperson Daniel M. Riviello wrote in an email to The Crimson.
The reported crime occurred in the midst of the Harvard football game against Brown taking place across the river at Harvard Stadium.
One state police officer was stationed at the crime scene at approximately 9 p.m. Saturday evening. Several Securitas security guards were also patrolling the area by the banks of the Charles River that fringes JFK Park and the river Houses.
The reported crime comes approximately three weeks after a similar stabbing in the same vicinity. On Sept. 8, a man was reportedly stabbed multiple times near the intersection of Memorial Drive and JFK Street, just outside of John F. Kennedy Park.
HUPD did not send out an emergency advisory following the Sept. 8 stabbing case.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai accepted the Harvard Foundation’s Peter J. Gomes Humanitarian Award on Friday to a nearly 1,000 person standing ovation in Sanders Theater.
The 16-year-old Yousafzai, who gained international attention as a supporter of women’s education, roused the audience through her speech.
“We are not here to make a long list of issues we are facing,” Yousafzai said. “We are here to find the solution…and it is simple: education, education, education.”
Yousafzai began advocating for gender equality in education in 2008. Her activism led to reprisals from the Taliban, which attempted to assassinate her 2012. The international media followed her recovery, and Yousafazi continued to advocate for women undeterred by the Taliban.
“I want every girl, every child, to be educated,” Yousafazi famously said after the assassination attempt.
“These powerful words resonated with people around the world, with girls and boys, men and women,” said S. Allen Counter, director of the Harvard Foundation. “A new voice for gender equality was born.”
During the award ceremony, Yousafzai discussed women’s loss of freedom and the destruction of schools following the Taliban takeover of the Swat Valley, the region in Pakistan her family calls home.
“At that time, we did not keep silent,” she said. “We raised our voice—we raised our voice for the right of education.”
She also spoke of the U.N. campaign launched in her name at a question and answer session with reporters before the event. Yousafzai said she would not back down from advocacy because of the assassination attempt.
“Why should I wait for someone else?” she asked. “Why don’t I take a step forward? If I’m thinking that every girl should go to school and if I’m thinking about children who are suffering from child labor, I must continue my campaign for the education of girls and boys.”
Yousafzai also echoed words from a previous speech in July she delivered before the United Nations.
“Instead of sending guns, send pens. Instead of sending tanks, send textbooks. Instead of sending soldiers, send teacher,” she said.
During the ceremony the Harvard Foundation also recognized Junaid Khan with the Award of Appreciation for the role he played as a doctor in saving Yousafzai’s life after the assassination attempt.
“I believe that God saved my life. People’s prayers saved my life. And of course, Colonel Khan saved my life,” Yousafzai said.
Previous recipients of the Humanitarian Award include actor James Earl Jones, AIDS researcher David Ho, and Bishop Desmond Tutu.
The humanitarian award is given annually and honors the life and work of Reverend Peter J. Gomes, the longtime Memorial Church minister who died in 2011.

Perhaps the recent uproar caused by the baby squirrel that was claiming backpacks in Kirkland Courtyard made its mark, because Harvard’s been deemed one of the most squirrel-obsessed colleges by the Huffington Post.
With a little research, we found that Harvard has quite a history with the little furry rodents—who knew that Harvard is known as the originator of the sport of squirrel fishing (it’s like regular fishing, except on land and with nuts as bait)? Turns out that Harvard is that very originator, at least according to the Kennedy School’s Harvard Squirrel Archive (yes, such a thing exists), where you can relive 377 years of Harvardian squirrel history.
 
We came up with some ideas for how our newly official status as a squirrel-obsessed institution might be reflected in student life. Expect undergraduates to become preoccupied with saving up d-hall food for the winter, and to scurry to class as fast as possible using parkour.
 
Socializing could also change now that students will be spending much more of their time holed up in basement common rooms, but expect a little more agility on the dance floor on Friday nights, especially from December to February (winter mating season in some squirrels’ worlds).
 
Plus, now that our squirrels have made it to rock star status on the World Wide Web, we at Flyby anticipate a few extra perks for our furry friends. Are walnuts at every meal too much to ask? We know an adorable baby squirrel who could use it.

September is coming to an end, which means for us freshmen that we’ve all completed our first full month here at college! Even though I’m giving serious thought as to how I’ve accomplished this feat, here’s some more wisdom I’ve picked up in the last few weeks. 
1. Master the art of quickly switching Internet tabs from BuzzFeed to an educational website whenever somebody walks past your computer screen in the quiet room of Lamont.
 
You know you have the worst luck in all of the world when people never walk past you when you’re focusing on your Latin translation, but they do right in that moment when you happen to be taking a break and you’re emphatically nodding your head in complete agreement to a BuzzFeed article titled “27 Struggles That Lactose-Intolerant People Know All Too Well.” No words can express how embarrassed I felt when I saw the guy walking past my computer screen making a valiant effort to stifle his laughter at the image of me scrolling through my article whispering “Preach it” every five seconds under my breath. Don’t worry, I’ve thoroughly learned my lesson that I should probably have the iSite of one of my classes open at all times to prevent myself from becoming a public humiliation at Lamont.
 
2. Be a part of group iMessages to look popular in front of people.
 
I absolutely hate it when I’m talking to a friend and we both hear an iPhone ringtone and check our phones, only to realize that it’s not mine. Or when I’m checking my phone during class in a crowded lecture to see if anyone texted me, and the two people to my left and right can see how unpopular I am since I have zero notifications. Luckily, I’ve learned the beauty of group iMessages recently, through chats between my best friends from high school, my suitemates, and friends in my entryway. For instance, the question “Who wants to get lunch right now?” elicits about 10 replies in our entryway group iMessage, making my phone go off nonstop and therefore filling me with a false and lame sense of short-lived popularity.
 
3. Find out who’s in charge of the HUDS playlist and befriend him or her immediately.
 
I was standing in front of the water dispenser at Annenberg a couple of weeks ago, wondering if I had the patience to wait in line for my usual “chilled still” water or if I should just go for the underappreciated and uncomfortably lukewarm “ambient still” option. In the midst of coming to the pathetic realization that I have way too much time on my hands to be having an internal debate about my water options, I literally perked up when I heard my favorite Lana Del Rey blasting in the dining hall. I thought it was merely a lucky coincidence that HUDS knew exactly what I’d wanted to listen to on that day, but I was completely wrong. A couple of days after that, HUDS threw it back at dinner with some Destiny’s Child (who doesn’t love old school Beyonce?), helping me get through my typical “Why is it Tuesday and not Friday” sadness. So this is a shout-out to whoever is in charge of the playlist at Annenberg: thank you for making my day with your eclectic mix of childhood pop, alternative music, and everything in between.

This is Part II of Flyby’s two-part From Cali to Cambridge mini-series. Check out Part I!
“Yeah, this is the coldest weather I have ever been in in my life,” a dormmate from Sri Lanka said to me as we walked back from dinner. It was September 15. The vicious New England (summer? …winter?) wind ripped through his t-shirt and shorts and I felt incredibly concerned as I imagined him walking through campus in December.
I wondered who was experiencing greater culture shock: me, a born and bred Northern Californian, or him. Because let me tell you, sometimes I have felt like I’m in a foreign country.
  While I’ve always lived in Palo Alto, California, I didn’t embrace everything about it. For example, sometimes I was irritated that all the food at my friend Sophie’s house had to contain a combination of flax seed, hemp hearts, or chia seed (preferably all three) or her family would refuse to eat it. Now, I find myself craving these foods (thanks for the soy crisp-spirulina hemp bar-flaxseed cracker-filled care package, Mom!!). I can munch on my organic, gluten-free goodies and try to pretend I’m still in California, but fundamental aspects of life are completely different here in Massachusetts. 
1) Water. The first day, one of my roommates lugged five cases of Crystal Geyser water bottles into our room. “Look what we got, guys!” she announced excitedly. I forced myself to smile, “Great!” Yes, it was very nice of her to provide water for our room, and I was happy she was concerned about our hydration, but I couldn’t recall the last time I had seen so many plastic bottles in one place. I wondered what the effect on my carbon footprint would be. I remembered the time I had forgotten to bring my water bottle to spinning class and purchased a $28 glass one instead of a plastic bottle.
2) Food and Drink. The red-eye from San Francisco was rough. It was 5 a.m. when I got to Boston and I was desperate for Starbucks. I ran up and down the terminal in distress but all I could find was a Dunkin' Donuts. I needed caffeine but Dunkin' Donuts simply didn’t seem like a valid substitute. I decided to endure the fatigue, rather than support the business that was responsible for a lower concentration of Starbucks and artisan coffee shops in Boston. Even when I do find my favorite drinks here, I find there are few that understand the significance. Last week I ran up to a group of people, holding a jar of kombucha from the farmer’s market. “Kombucha on tap! This is great!!” I was greeted with many blank stares. “Kombucha?” someone finally responded, her voice filled with disgust. “It’s this amazing fermented tea drink. I promise you that you’ll like it if you try it.” I offered a sip. No one wanted to try.
3) Clothing. A friend came into my room one day. “Do you own any jeans?” he asked, “I only see you in leggings and yoga pants. Why is half your dresser filled with workout clothes?” Well it’s true that I’m more often than not in a pair of Lululemons, but you can’t blame me. Before coming here, it had been months since the last time I wore jeans. When I was home, I spent most of my time over the summer in workout clothes, because I spent most of my time with my friends, so I spent much of my time working out. Walking around Palo Alto red-faced and in sweaty exercise clothes was a truly great thing. It meant that you had just gone to yoga/spin/pilates/pure barre/boxing/TRX. I enjoyed putting together color-coordinated spandex workout outfits (so much more fun than any other kind of clothing) and spent a large percentage of my money buying exercise clothing and accessories.
4) Working out. Working out was always a social event. I feel most at home here when I’m in one of my exercise outfits, but still, the process of working out is very different. Here, people go to the gym. They go on the elliptical and the treadmill; they lift weights; they do abs. In California, you go to classes that are a combination of at least two types of exercise: power yoga, yogalates, spinning with weights, ballet and circuit training etc. Even better is an exercise class where the name tells you absolutely nothing about the content, for example: Grit, Bliss, Dailey Method.
5) Transportation. Yes, I drive a Prius (of course) but I often complained about the dangerous masses of bikers that took control of the streets of Palo Alto, forcing me to drive to school at five miles per hour. “I wish fewer people biked. I hate having to drive so slowly everywhere,” I once told a classmate. “No,” she told me, “You should feel bad about killing the environment by driving and the bikers should be rewarded for their service to humanity.” Here, bikers and pedestrians are certainly not rewarded. In fact, in practice, they don’t really have right of way. Yesterday, I was nearly hit by a cop car while crossing Mass. Ave.
6) Shopping. Given the large impact that they can have on one’s carbon footprint, plastic and paper shopping bags are an absolute no-no for Northern Californians. Here, however, cashiers don’t give you the evil eye when you forget to bring your own reusable bag. A friend of mine, another Palo Alto transplant studying in the Northeast, called me the other day and related the following story. “The cashier at Gourmet Heaven was surprised when I decided to walk out of the store struggling to carry five kombuchas back to my dorm room rather than accept the free plastic bag she was offering me. Little does she know that not only are plastic bags banned where I’m from in Northern California, there is a tax on paper bags!”
