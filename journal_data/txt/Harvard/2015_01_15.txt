After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Institute of Politics announced on Thursday its spring class of resident fellows, which includes a political journalist, a former U.S. senator, and Massachusetts’s outgoing attorney general, Martha M. Coakley.
The five fellows—Coakley, former U.S. Senator Kay R. Hagan, former National Republican Senatorial Committee deputy executive director Matt Lira, TIME Magazine Washington correspondent Jay Newton-Small, and former New York City Council speaker Christine C. Quinn—will join the IOP from February to May and host study groups and office hours.
Coakley, the Democrat who lost to Charles D. Baker ’79 in Massachusetts’s gubernatorial election last fall, had filed a disclosure with the State Ethics Commission last month saying she was under consideration for a “short-term fellowship position” at an unnamed Massachusetts university. The Boston Globe subsequently reported that the university was Harvard.
There is a formal application process for the fellowship that can take several months, said Eric R. Andersen, the director of the IOP’s fellows and study groups program. He said applications are reviewed by the IOP’s staff as well as its undergraduate student advisory committee.
Andersen characterized this year’s fellows as a “dynamic” group, a “group of people who have made a significant difference in their various areas of expertise and in their jobs.” He pointed to Coakley and Hagan specifically as examples of having a “deep interest in working with people to better their lives” he said is present in all of the spring fellows.
Newton-Small will be leading a study group on women in the workforce, the topic of the book she is currently working on, focusing specifically on the sociological theory of “critical mass,” which she said examines the changes that happen when “you have somewhere between 20 percent to 30 percent of women in any working environment.”
“All three branches in the government are reaching critical mass at the same time,” she said, adding that the differences and changes in the gender balance of the public and private sectors was another potential topic for discussions.
Lira, who also served as a senior advisor to former U.S. House of Representatives majority leader Eric Cantor and former vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan’s digital director, will be exploring modern transformations in communication and organization and their impact on American political processes, campaigns, and government.
“I really want to explore the nature of that transformation, what exactly is happening, and then hopefully get to the point where we can talk about how we can leverage these changes to improve the system as a whole, to repair the relationship between the public and the [government],” Lira said.
IOP spokesperson Esten Perez said study group topics are still being finalized and will be made public in February.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It seemed like nothing at first. When senior forward Jonah Travis entered the game in the second half, the Harvard men’s basketball team (10-4, 1-0 Ivy) was missing layups, struggling to defend the basket, and stuck in a double-digit deficit that all but assured the team’s first loss against Boston College (8-7, 0-3 ACC) since 2006.
Not a person in Conte Forum could tell you that this substitution would change the game.
Harvard had shot an abysmal 25 percent from the field and 12.5 percent from beyond the arc to go along with 10 turnovers in the first half. Though the Crimson would eventually fall, 64-57 in overtime, it was Travis who catalyzed the squad and opened the door to the comeback to force an extra five minutes of playing time.
“I thought Jonah did give us a shot in the arm,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “His energy off the bench was noticeable and needed…. He got on the backboard and was gritty and tough.”
Travis entered the game with 15:16 left in the game and his team down 12 points. After sophomore guard Corbin Miller missed on a three, Travis sprinted beyond the base line, leaping into the crowd, and saving the possession, throwing the ball between his legs to junior co-captain Siyani Chambers, who finished the night with 10 points and four assists after being blanked in the first half.
Seconds later, Travis ripped the ball from Boston College’s Aaron Brown. The senior's teammates would soon start to feed off his energy, as a steal by Chambers a minute later led to Miller’s second three of the night.
“It always helps to have guys come in like that [because] the rest of us can feed off that energy,” said Miller. “It is important that we have a player that can come in and do it for us. The rest of us definitely feed off that.”
On the ensuing possession, Travis continued to will his team back, drawing a charge as part of a defensive effort that would see the Eagles go scoreless for over four straight minutes.
Though severely undersized at 6’6”, Travis skied up over Boston College center Dennis Clifford, who towers at 7’0”, for the offensive board on the next play. Right on cue, Travis got the ball back, took a hard dribble, and knocked down the step-back jumper to cut the lead to six. The comeback was on.
From there, senior guard Wesley Saunders, who paced Harvard with 15 points, continued to attack the lane and draw fouls to get to the line. Meanwhile, Miller did what he does best: shoot.
The sophomore knocked down two more threes in a row, followed by a long jumper with 6:54 to play to tie the game at 39 apiece. The Eagles responded with a basket, but a drive by Saunders followed by a steal and dunk from junior forward Evan Cummins gave the Crimson its first lead of the night.
But that lead would never grow beyond two points. With his team down a bucket, guarded by the much smaller Chambers, Brown found space underneath the rim with 34 ticks on the clock to tie the game.
With 19 seconds remaining, Saunders drove the lane, spun, and tossed up an errant fade away jumper—a scene all too familiar to his missed game-winning attempt against Holy Cross in November.
“The play is exactly what we want, which is in Wesley’s hands in the paint,” Amaker said. “There’s no better play that anyone else could draw up…. He’s the most dynamic offensive player and if you can get it in his hands on the move and get to the paint… you take that every day of the week and twice on Sunday.”
In overtime, Boston College quickly jumped out to a 56-51 lead, as Harvard only managed to connect on two field goals in the extra period of play.  Though a layup from Chambers would cut the lead to two, Eagles senior Patrick Heckmann delivered the dagger with just 46 seconds remaining courtesy of a corner three on the ensuing possession to put his squad up by five and put the game out of reach.
While the loss will have no impact on Harvard’s bid to win its fourth straight Ivy League title, the status of senior center Kenyatta Smith certainly will. With 18:02 left in the second half, Smith came down awkwardly on his ankle, cringing in pain. Though Amaker said Smith’s status is unknown at this point, Smith did suffer a broken left foot last February that plagued him all of last season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One would forgive Boston College fans Wednesday night for seeing a bit of Vitas Gerulaitis in their team. After losing six straight to the Crimson by an average of 13.3 points, the Eagles (8-7, 0-3 ACC) came out Wednesday night against the Harvard men’s basketball team (10-4, 1-0 Ivy) determined to turn it around.
With a 64-57 overtime decision that saw the Eagles blow the Crimson off the court for two five-minute stretches and struggle to score in the other 35, Jim Christian’s squad snapped a three-game skid and handed Harvard its third road loss in five contests.
WILD, WILD WES
On the day that he was officially cut from Naismith Trophy consideration, senior wing Wesley Saunders had arguably the worst game of his career. Tasked with the unenviable twosome of carrying the Crimson offense and shutting down star Eagles guard Olivier Hanlan, Saunders missed 15 shots and had seven turnovers—including an air ball and an errant pass on the last two possessions of the second half.
Afterwards, Saunders, who played all 45 minutes, was unwilling to accept the magnitude of his burden as an excuse for his play.
“It was definitely a difficult task given some of the sets that they run.... I have to stay locked in, and it was tough and took a lot of energy,” Saunders said. “[But] I have done it before, so it is not really an excuse.”
However, the game was more indicative of the wing’s recent play than a blimp in the radar. Since entering the Virginia game as unquestionably the Ivy League’s best player—garnering significant attention along the way—Saunders has yet to score more than 15 points in a game. He has registered six or more rebounds once in six games after doing so five times in the first eight contests.
Wednesday’s game illuminated the reason for Saunders’ struggles. The team as a whole shot under 32 percent and, outside of sophomore guard Corbin Miller, no player made a three. Junior co-captain Siyani Chambers is the only shooter in an anemic offensive starting unit, and without Chambers shooting consistently (0-for-6 from three Wednesday, 35 percent for the year), Saunders is left without room to operate.
JONAH WITH ARC
With Saunders’ struggling, nobody better exemplified what the team did well offensively than senior reserve Jonah Travis. Travis had just four points in 17 minutes, but his four offensive rebounds gave the team a necessary boost, extending possessions as Harvard clawed its way back into the game.
After entering the game with 16 minutes to go and the Crimson down 11, Travis and Miller stopped a 5-0 BC run with 13 points in a 15-4 Harvard run. Twice in the second half, Travis rebounded a close miss and turned it into points.
The first, a soft turnaround jumper on the right block, brought the Crimson to within six. The second, two free throws with three minutes to go, brought Harvard even at 45.
“Sometimes for me as a coach, we get knocked back early and all of a sudden we have to bring it to a different level,” coach Tommy Amaker said. “I was hopeful we would be able to bring it to that level at the opening tap and for whatever reason they did and we didn’t, and Jonah came in and ramped things up for us.”
FAMILIAR PATTERNS
After 14 games, the loss Wednesday reinforced what have been the possible hamartias for the Crimson thus far this season: turnovers and spacing. Harvard turned the ball over 17 times on Wednesday, including 10 times in the first half—where it scored just 19 points. The team compounded the issue by shooting 21 percent from behind the arc, reducing its offense at times to isolation plays and side-pick-and-rolls for Saunders.
Co-captain Steve Moundou-Missi and Saunders were the prime contributors in both respects, making six of their 26 combined shots and throwing in 11 turnovers against just one assist.
However, following the game, Amaker referenced neither issue, noting instead that he was concerned about the team’s inconsistency.
“I think we are like a lot of people right now around the country [in] that we are a little inconsistent and haven’t put together a 40 minute game,” Amaker said. “I mentioned to our players that I thought we deserved the second half and they deserved the game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Between Feb. 2012—when senior defenseman Josephine Pucci last scored for the Harvard women’s hockey team—and Wednesday’s game against New Hampshire, the nationally awarded defenseman lived a career in miniature.
Three years ago, there was a career-altering concussion, suffered after a Canadian skater blindsided Pucci during a national competition. Two years ago, there was fallout: symptoms, medical tests, and finally the decision to withdraw from college for the year.
Then last year, there was recovery—so much recovery that Pucci skipped the Crimson’s 2013-2014 season to help Team USA win a silver medal at the Sochi Olympics.
This Wednesday against the Wildcats (4-16-1, 2-9-0 Hockey East), Pucci passed another milestone. With her second-period slap shot, the current senior not only put Harvard (12-2-2, 9-1-1 ECAC) up, 3-0, but also earned the right to celebrate her first collegiate goal in three years.
“It was exciting,” Pucci said. “I have been having a lot of fun getting out there again.”
But she spent little time romanticizing the moment.
“There are areas of my game that I can continue to brush up [on],” Pucci said.
A solid UNH defense and a larger-than-normal sheet of ice tested Harvard’s offensive patience. However, the No. 5/5 Crimson hung tough to score in the last six minutes of each period and claim a 4-1 win—the team’s 10th straight victory.
For the third game in a row, the Harvard defense did not concede a goal until the third period. Four minutes remained in the game by that point, and the Crimson still held a three-goal lead.
“[We shut out UNH by] using the size of the ice to our advantage [and] making hard breakout passes,” Pucci said. “I think the team is strong all around.”
After the hosts scored, senior Hillary Crowe responded with a goal of her own in the waning moments of the game. Senior forward Samantha Reber slipped a pass across the goalmouth to give Crowe a routine finish.
Defense became offense earlier on as well when a deflected pass in the defensive zone turned into a two-on-one opportunity for Harvard on the other end 14 minutes into the second frame.
Junior forward Mary Parker carried the puck herself, shot, and finished her own rebound. With her third goal in four games, Parker put the Crimson up, 2-0.
Harvard’s offense, which has come alive of late, is averaging six goals per game over its last four victories.
“We have talked a lot about driving hard to the net and taking off-angle shots,” Crowe said. “We have a lot of speed on our team, and Coach [Stone] has made a point that we…utilize it.”
But it did take 17 minutes and a determined solo effort to put Harvard on the board in the first period. After collecting the puck near her own goal, senior defenseman Sarah Edney streaked from end to end to slide a finish past the UNH goalie.
Despite this late flash, the Wildcats, losers of seven of their last eight games, played a close first period with the Crimson. Harvard tallied nine shots during this time; the University of New Hampshire tallied eight.
Part of the reason for this slow start was the abnormal size of the rink.
“It was a very different sheet of ice than we were used to,” Crowe said. “Our transition game wasn’t as dominant…. In the first period, we talked about simple adjustments that would give our team energy and speed in such a big and different rink.”
Such changes led to renewed energy, as the Crimson not only won the second frame, 2-0, thanks to the scores from Pucci and Parker, but also built a 13-3 shot advantage.
“The ultimate goal is winning a national championship, no question,” Crowe said. “However, the road to Minnesota is long…. We talk about taking a piece of every team along the way and staying true to the mentality that everyday is an opportunity to get better.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s volleyball team is out for revenge.
The 2014 season was full of major accomplishments for the Crimson: a program-best national ranking of 13th, an 11-3 conference record, and multiple players having been named all-EIVA.
But there was one feat that left the team wanting more. Harvard wanted a chance to return to the EIVA finals—a benchmark the team achieved for the first time in program history in 2013.
The team that stood in the Crimson’s way in the conference semi-finals was Princeton—the only other men’s volleyball team in the Ivy League. Harvard defeated the Tigers twice in the regular season, with both games going a full five sets. But things didn’t go the Crimson’s way in the teams' final meeting, as it fell to Princeton, 3-1.
“I don’t think we were a good enough serving team to really beat the elite teams [last year], and we worked a lot on that this fall,” Harvard coach Brian Baise said.
But with an abundance of new faces, the Crimson is ready to start a new championship run. Harvard lost five seniors following last season and added four new freshmen to the roster—a major change for a roster of only 12 athletes.
“They are going to be given a lot of responsibility early on, and they’ll be tested,” Baise said. “They’re bringing a lot of energy, they’re competitive, they train hard everyday, and they are reliable on and off the court.... They are going to be impact players this year as freshman.”
The four new additions—Brad Gretsch, Jack Heavey, Marko Kostich, and Riley Moore—were named the eighth strongest recruiting class in the country by Volleyball Magazine. But they will certainly have big shoes to fill.
Last year’s co-captains, seniors Nick Madden and Chris Gibbons, were major contributors throughout the season. Gibbons holds the top spot in program history for career digs. Meanwhile, Madden was crucial in big games, recording double digit kills in both of the Crimson’s victories against the Tigers.
The team does not have much time to get adjusted to competing, however, as it faces two nationally ranked teams in the first weekend of the season. Though they are not conference games, matches against No. 5 Lewis and No. 1 Loyola will be significant tests early on to show how Harvard can hold up against some of the country’s top competitors.
“This weekend is huge,” co-captain Caleb Zimmick said. “It will be a formidable task to play against those teams to start off, but I think it will be really exciting.”
Leading the team as co-captains this season are outside hitter DJ White and middle blocker Zimmick. White had career highs last season in both kills and attacks and was a top-five EIVA hitter.  Zimmick was named to the all-conference team and set career highs in kills, attacks, blocks, and block assists.
Both captains are within striking distance of moving up the ladder with team records in nearly every statistical category. With such a young team, the Crimson will look to the leadership and experience of White and Zimmick as the team faces a tough schedule.
“One of the big takeaways [from last season]…is that we can really compete with anybody,” Zimmick said. “We have that confidence to just know we belong.”
Harvard will once again have the opportunity to prove that it belongs once again, looking to improve on its 15-8 overall record from last year. The Crimson was picked to finish fourth in the EIVA preseason poll, with Penn State expected to finish atop the league again. It has two chances to redeem itself against Princeton on Feb. 13th and Apr. 3rd, as well as two face-offs against Penn St., the reigning EIVA champion for the past sixteen years.
The Crimson will have its first home contest January 23rd when it faces Ball State and IPFW.
