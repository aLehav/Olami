After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As news pours in from around the country about other colleges' spring shows, Harvard awaits the announcement of Yardfest 2013's lineup with bated breath. Will it be Panic! at the Disco (because so many of us apparently want to believe that)? Macklemore, because he, like many of us, only has $20.00 in his pocket? In the meantime, a list of our most likely candidates:
The screaming goat
The most inclusive show possible is the one in which no one is required to know lyrics, rhythm, or pitch in order to sing along. Widely acknowledged as one of the most disorienting and mesmerizing phenomena of the year so far, the screaming goat has quickly replaced Taylor Swift as the near-perfect impersonator of the human voice.
Mumford & Sons, minus Mumford & Sons
Their 2012 album "Babel" immediately divided the world into two opposing parties—those who cared enough to get into cyber fights about it and those who did not. The College Events Board may attempt to please both factions (and cut costs) by booking only one part of the band—the banjos, arranged artfully on stage, perhaps gently plucked on occasion by a fresh spring breeze blowing through the silent Yard.
Gotye
In the tradition of booking one-hit wonders who sound vaguely familiar to most people but are noteworthy only for their mediocrity, Gotye is a likely candidate for Yardfest 2013. He would probably have to agree to sing "Somebody That I Used To Know" on loop for the entire set; otherwise, no one would have any idea who the naked guy in paint is.
Das Racist
But only the one guy who told us we were "drunk, overprivileged shits." The majority of the external world has an obligation to constantly remind us that we're all very rich, very snobby, very discriminatory, and probably wear nothing but those weird pink shorts and boat shoes during the summer. It's been rumored that that one member is actually lobbying to return for Yardfest 2013—probably so he can use our gold bathtubs, jewel-encrusted silverware, and down mattresses again.

On March 28, the Loeb Ex will be transformed into the interior of a family farm. “Acres of Diamonds,” written and directed by Andy J. Boyd ’14, takes place over the course of two days and chronicles the explosions and quiet struggles between family members.
“It’s fourth of July, nighttime,” says Boyd, describing the dramatic climax of his play. “There will be fireworks exploding off in the distance, throwing colors across the set in these big dramatic washes.”
The action on stage will be equally volatile. The patriarch, James (Joshua G. Wilson ’13), reveals he wants to sell the family farm, and his wife (Mallory J. Weiss ’15), and daughter (Amy Q. Friedman ’14, a Crimson editor) oppose his decision. According to the actors, the play is about trying to save the family as much as it is about trying to save the farm.  “It gives a small picture of something everyone is very connected to: the American experience, all the good and the bad,” says Aaron I. Henricks ’16, who plays the brother-in-law trying to buy the farm.“Mostly the bad, in this play.”
Indeed, tensions are very high as the actors rehearse one of the scenes—at one point, all nine characters position themselves around James, all physically engaged and poised to argue. The scene is at once theatrical and realistic, an uneasy balance that Boyd hopes will come to life in this play, which is the seventh he has written and the third he has directed at Harvard.
Matthew B. Barrieau ’16, the stage manager, says that the set will also reflect Boyd’s nuanced realism in the script and the acting. He describes a simple family room and dining room, eerily overshadowed by a back wall made of scrap wood and debris, which is meant to make the house look like it is exploding.
“I’m interested in how we get a sense of theatrical imagination into naturalism,” Boyd says.

“The cultural aspect of citizenship has often been muted,” said Professor Homi K. Bhabha, director of the Mahindra Humanities Center, at a symposium called “Cultural Citizenship” on Saturday. Bhabha spoke as part of a panel moderated by Diana Sorensen, Dean of Arts and Sciences. The panel also included lecturer on law Jacqueline Bhabha, lecturer on law, Yo-Yo Ma ’76, the Silk Road Ensemble artistic director; and Colin Jacobsen and Cristina Pato, both members of musical performance group, the Silk Road Ensemble. The symposium, a joint presentation by the Mahindra Humanities Center and the Silk Road Project, explored the idea of a culturally based definition of identity and the idea of cultural diffusion through the lenses of current events and music.
 
The members of the Silk Road Ensemble, many of whom are immigrants, are known for bringing together musical influences from many cultural backgrounds. Opening the event with Brahms’s Piano Quartet No. 1 in G minor—a piece that was inspired by traditional Roma music—performed by Ma, violinist Johnny Gandelsman, violist Nicholas Cords, and guest pianist Tania Rivers-Moore ’15, the group touched upon the influence that the music of the Roma had on classical composition. The group had not met before Saturday morning, but were able to perform successfully, Ma said, because of their shared language of music.
 
Following the performance, the panel discussed cultural identities that are not strictly tied to a certain legally recognized state, which they agreed are becoming more and more salient. Jacqueline Bhabha, an expert on the Roma people, explained their history of discrimination and surprisingly resilient cultural identity.
 
Previously called Gypsies, the Roma have lived in Europe for hundreds of years and to this day live in camps with few amenities and have difficulty crossing borders. Though they are hardly a united people, Bhabha said that they maintain a strong cultural identity. “It’s remarkable that a community that has enormous difficulties…[has] this tremendously vibrant tradition, particularly music,” she said. “They don’t share a language, they don’t share a religion, they don’t share a nationality, they don’t even share an appearance, but they do share this very strong sense of a cultural community.” 
 
The panelists agreed that sometimes it can be daunting to cross cultural borders. Pato, who specializes in the gaita—a type of bagpipes that is closely tied to an autonomous community in northwest Spain called Galicia—described the critical commentary she received for trying to bring the traditional instrument into novel situations. The gaita has long been associated with the Galician national identity and the way it is distinct from Spain as a whole. “I would have people…screaming and complaining that what I was doing wasn’t right because it was a traditional instrument related to a very political side of Galicia,” she said. 
 
Ma spoke about the experience of being a cultural ambassador. “You start from the inside,” he said. Ma also discussed the ensemble’s decision to perform the Brahms in a more authentic, rhythm-based style rather than traditional classical phrasing to emphasize the piece’s connection to Roma tradition. “Understanding the value priorities of any tradition you’re working with…can give you huge bonus points in heading towards a fair translation,” he said.
 
Jacobsen, who plays violin in the Ensemble, said that making such cultural boundary-crossings work requires a strong foundation in one’s own culture as well as trust in the potential to communicate between the two cultures.  “You have to know something; otherwise you have no ground on which to stand,” he said. “It doesn’t mean you have to learn everything about another tradition in order to participate in it; you need a sense of courage to leap into the unknown…. You may fail, but in failing you hopefully learn something as well.” 
 
Following the panel discussion, the entire Silk Road Ensemble took to the stage, inviting the audience to clap along to an upbeat, Hebrew-influenced John Zorn composition called “Briel from Book of Angels.” The piece showcased instruments with strong affiliations with certain cultures, including a Chinese mouth organ called a sheng, the Indian classical drums called the tabla, and the Galician gaita. Beaming with excitement, Ma gave percussion instruments to all the panelists and showed them how to join in the revelry. The panel’s subject matter had sometimes been somber, but the music functioned as it has for centuries—as the distinct, strong voices of many cultures blended to form something harmonious.

Take  the plot of “The Vow,” combine it with the special effects of  “Inception,” mottle it with blatant political symbolism, and you’ll get  the romance of the week: “Upside Down.” This film takes place in a  distant corner of the galaxy where a pair of twin planets have opposite  gravitational fields. People from each planet can only experience  gravitational pull from their own planet, making a separation of the  populations inevitable. The two worlds’ populations coexist in a  Marxist-style relationship, the haves residing on the wealthy “Up” while  the have-nots struggle for life on “Down.”
 
Unsanctioned  contact between the two worlds is harshly punished. Despite this, two  teenagers, creatively named Adam and Eden, from these forcefully  separated planets embark on a forbidden love affair after they discover a  place where the two worlds intersect high up in the mountains as  children. After some expository romantic scenes, the authorities  discover the two in the midst of an illegal tryst. The authorities drag  Adam away, and he is left thinking that Eden is dead. The plot takes an  expected turn when he discovers that she is alive but suffering from  amnesia. The romantic pursuit begins, and all odds are magically  overcome and all barriers permanently torn down through bees, science,  and, of course, pregnancy. Every conflict is met with a puzzlingly  nonsensical plot device that raises a whole host of logical concerns,  but this does not seem to trouble any of the characters in the film.
 
Kirsten  Dunst portrays Eden, the amnesiac heartthrob from Up, while Jim  Sturgess plays Adam, the scientist from Down. A bevy of kindhearted  co-workers from both planets adds occasional humor and magically solves  most of the larger issues with shockingly simple solutions. The  characters beg to be likable, but at times this is impossible.  Sturgess’s coworker Bob (Timothy Spall) is meant to appear as a  trustworthy character, but his initial smoke-filled rendezvous with Adam  and intense requests for stamps make him seem a bit suspicious, and an  untrustworthy air lingers around him until the end credits roll.  Sturgess also tends to give off a slightly creepy vibe, with a crazed  look often coming to his eyes when he speaks to Dunst. Pair that with  his spastic mode of conversation and the fact that he continually looks  like he needs a shower, and the love the two share seems even more  implausible.
 
Sturgess  isn’t the only one who is at times hard to love. As if having amnesia  weren’t enough of a challenge to their forbidden love, Eden’s mood  swings also serve as a major deterrent to the relationship. She flips  between being giddy at Sturgess’s very presence to being offended by the  touch of his hand. She laughs, she flirts, she cries on a couch in  darkness, all at the drop of a hat, making her character increasingly  tiresome as the movie carries on. 
The  mild and predictable set of characters is matched by a not-so-mild,  although equally predictable, political atmosphere. An evil corporation  called TransWorld causes a giant explosion, which orphans Adam and  leaves a majority of Down in a post-apocalyptic state. This corporation  exploits Down, taking its oil and selling it back to Down’s people at  exorbitant rates. At times, the film feels like an extremely crude  critique of the oil industry set against a futuristic backdrop. The  border police also make several appearances, hunting with dogs and  shooting freely at anyone daring to cross the border.
 
While  the plot is disappointingly stale and the acting falters at times, the  special effects in the film make it stand apart from other romance films  premiering this season. The moments where the worlds interact on the  same floor of TransWorld are truly impressive, as are the landscapes  created when city lights rather than stars illuminate the world below.  Characters are frequently seen interacting in opposite gravities, and  the world created through the special effects team is consistent and  utterly seamless. In every moment where the setting has the opportunity  to disappoint, it instead impresses. If the storyline bores, the visuals  excite, giving the film at least one very redeeming quality.
 
While  the film feels like a hodgepodge of elements from other, more  successful movies, it still manages to be entertaining. The characters,  although not always enchanting, are certainly sympathetic. The special  effects manage to hold the viewer’s attention, and although it’s  predictable, the story can certainly still be enjoyed. Will this film  change the lives of all who are exposed to it? Probably not. Could  Nicholas Sparks write a more convincing love story? Probably. “Upside  Down” will, however, at least make for a decidedly average Friday night  rental.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Gender imbalances at Harvard remain an unresolved issue. A recent report on gender and student leadership commissioned by the Undergraduate Council and the Harvard College Women’s Center documented the persistence of segregation and disparities between male and female students in campus organizations. In terms of raw numbers, men and women lead organizations at roughly the same frequency. However, behind this comforting piece of data lays a distressing trend: Over half of student organizations exhibit gender-skewed leadership, defined as having at least two-thirds of its leadership from one gender, and an organization’s perceived prestige is positively correlated with male-skewed or even all-male leadership. These findings are consistent with those of a similar study commissioned five years ago. This should indicate to us that there is something amiss about the way prestige is defined and gendered at Harvard.
About 48 percent of the 29 organizations identified as most prestigious in the survey of about 500 undergraduates and four of the five most prestigious organizations had male students filling up leadership positions by at least two-thirds The list was topped by old and property-owning organizations, whose status can be traced back to an age when Harvard was not a coeducational institution. Indeed, there appears to still be an unfortunate sense of perceived incongruence between female leadership and those organizations on campus that were only open to males for a long part of their history: One female student interviewed by the UC, for instance, argued that a woman leading an old and “prestigious” organization would be seen as “different and ambitious.” Conversely, another respondent went as far as to say that a "call for [female] domesticity still very much exists" at Harvard. Vestiges of the old single-gender Harvard, it would seem, are still affecting campus life by preserving an atmosphere of male predominance that surrounds the University’s oldest organizations.
Harvard today has much to celebrate in the way of the progress its women have made: Definite development has been made between today and the merger of Harvard and Radcliffe College. Even when looking at peer institutions, we seem to be doing comparatively well: A report commissioned in 2011 by the Steering Committee on Undergraduate Women’s Leadership at Princeton found imbalances of greater magnitude than those evidenced at Harvard. However, we have a long way that is yet to be travelled.  The recent report called attention to the many doors that are still only half-open to female students at Harvard. No woman should feel less apt or ready to lead a high-profile campus organization, and preconceptions of any kind should not drive extracurricular involvement. An absence of male leadership in female-dominated fields, such as mental health, wellness, and public service, is equally troubling: Perceptions of certain spheres as associated with a particular gender inhibits all individuals from realizing their full potential.
While acknowledging the gender disparities that still persist on our campus, we should ask ourselves why traditions of male ascendancy are still related to perceived prestige and what can be done to address this, both at Harvard and in the U.S. at large. Gendered fields not only prevent individuals from entering the organizations to which they are best suited, but they also systematically disadvantage women because those fields which are considered prestigious are invariably those that are gendered male. Rather than ask why more women are not entering prestigious fields, we should be asking why activities that are led by women are assumed to be less prestigious ways to spend one’s time.
The action steps recommended by the report seem promising starting points to correcting the gender imbalance in student leadership: programs of mentorship within extracurricular organizations, greater female faculty representation, first-year orientation conversations, and deeper discussion on the gender dynamics of student groups. There is room to do better, for the sake of gender inclusivity both at Harvard and the world beyond our gates.

I haven’t really discovered the true meaning of cancer survivorship. Yesterday marked my one-year anniversary of finishing treatment for Hodgkin’s Lymphoma, and in the past year, I tried to live like a normal college student—finishing problem sets ’til late, going out with friends on weekends, eating greasy food. Then, my guilty conscience kicked in: I should be more health-conscious and appreciate life more (Saturday Night Live’s “YOLO” video comes to mind). I should do anything in my power to avoid relapse.
In the past, I dismissed setbacks easily, but during my treatment, it was hard to forget. The glimmer of hope during tough, biweekly chemo appointments was the 48-hour mark when all the drugs finally left my system. I supplanted those 48 hours of worry with sleep and jigsaw puzzles. Piece by piece, I worked towards finishing each puzzle and reaching the 48-hour mark. These puzzles were motivation to get through another day. 
As time goes on and I’m more removed from cancer, I appreciate this welcome fragmentation even more. The silver linings were the little victories every week: eating a banana, walking to a neighbor’s house, finishing a puzzle. I approach my history with a light heart thanks to those distractions and small accomplishments every hour. I Relay because I want more people to have that glimmer of hope, those little victories, and that silver lining from finishing treatment. —Alice
When I was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma after my sophomore year at Harvard, I considered my life over—my social life, my academic life, my future. I was what I did, and I was doing nothing. I would no longer graduate in the Class of 2012, but awkwardly mid-year, “March 2013,” if I ever made it back to campus. My momentum was derailed, it was going all wrong, and nothing would be able to get me that time back.
I can say this now because I am well—my experience was a blessing in disguise. I came back to school with a new lease on life.  Friends became more important than deadlines, and I found a sense of self and purpose that transcended what I “did” at Harvard. The semester after Commencement 2012 was quite possibly my favorite. I wrote my thesis at a comfortable pace, with a summer break mid-thesis that most students never get. I made friends that I never would have made otherwise, and I had the chance to lead the Harvard Band. Without my cancer detour, my path never would have led me to these opportunities.
For me, Relay for Life is a motivational experience that lets me take stock of my life’s journey. I Relay to remind myself and others that life is precious and ripe for the picking. —Elizabeth
I was diagnosed with osteosarcoma right before freshman year of high school. I was in and out of the hospital for nine months enduring chemo treatments, endless poking and prodding, and surgery to remove the tumor.
The surgery left me unable to run, ski, or play impact sports—ever again. At first, my knee functioned better than doctors expected, but over time I developed increasing chronic pain. My knee replacement was starting to collapse.
I despised the idea of more months on crutches, but last spring, I was forced to make a “now-or-never” decision about surgery. It wasn’t guaranteed to work, but I went for it. I missed finals and spent the summer at home, but the surgery was successful and I returned to school arguably healthier than I had been in years.
The surgery motivated me to travel during J-term. I ended up hiking in a Chilean national park. Thanks to my repaired knee, I made it to the end of the hike, where I found the most spectacular vista I have ever seen. It was the middle of summer, but there were snow-capped volcanoes, glaciers, and volcanic lakes in every direction, everything so untouched by time that it wouldn’t have seemed odd if a dinosaur had stepped into view. It was a moment that I will always cherish, one that continues to remind me of the positive ways in which cancer has affected my life. I Relay so that every cancer patient can look back on their experience and be thankful. —Valerie

Fans of liberty may have been disappointed with the results of November’s election, as the primary exponent of liberty, former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson, got walloped at the polls. For libertarians constantly disappointed at the creeping expansion of the government facilitated by both parties, this past week served as a consolation prize. First, a major party’s senator publicly championed civil liberties for the entire country to see. Subsequently, the senator’s act was heavily lauded—prime indication of a new groundswell of support for personal freedom.
Just a week ago, the concept of liberty seemed to be receding in the public eye. President Obama’s nomination for Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, John O. Brennan, was set to earn confirmation with overwhelming support, despite questions arising from his role as architect of the administration’s drone policy. While the initialization of the sequester signaled the type of reduced spending libertarians yearn for, pretty much everyone in the country would have preferred the government actually working out policy and governing in real time. Questions about the drone policy were repeatedly stonewalled, with little outlook of any progress in clarifying the rights American citizens maintain in the eyes of their government.
When Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky took the stand to declare his filibuster against Brennan, few believed it would have an impact on administration policy. Old-time GOP hawks like John McCain called Senator Paul and his liberty-minded allies “wacko birds,” swiftly dismissing the important role leaders must play in protecting their citizens from the tyranny of the majority. Conventional wisdom stated that the GOP, which is strongly influenced by neoconservative power players, would never endorse what detractors deem “isolationism” and “weak-willed foreign policy.”
In this case, conventional wisdom was proven wrong. Only starry-eyed idealists could have believed that a sole senator could actually wrestle any real information out of an administration so reluctant to show its hand to the American people. Yet by the time Paul’s 13-hour long marathon was over, he was no longer a lone crusader. Over time, he was joined first by his allies, like Senator Ted Cruz, and then by the greater Republican Party. At the end of the day, one of the most vocal advocates for Paul’s position was Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
If nothing else, Senator Paul’s effort made an impact on the Republican Party and on the direction in which its political positions are heading. It is clear that the party’s average supporter no longer endorses the outmoded neoconservative viewpoints manifest in Senators McCain and Graham, who both virulently decried Paul’s exercise shortly after its completion. While many libertarians may find it ironic that the next guarantors of civil liberties are to be found in the party of George W. Bush, it is increasingly evident that the Obama presidency has cut the vocal chords of its previous advocates. Ten years ago, common wisdom would have pilloried a pundit who said that the Democratic Party would have no qualms with the executive branch cultivating a “kill list” with exactly zero oversight.
Of course, only a pessimist can say that the only ramification of Paul’s opposite exists within the GOP ranks. Senator Paul did, in fact, receive a clarifying answer from Attorney General Eric Holder the day after his harangue, assuring Paul and the American public that President Obama does not have the authority to target a Hellfire missile at Jane Fonda while she tranquilly sips a latte in a café. Realists recognize that Holder only claimed that the president could not attack American citizens “not engaged in combat.” Such verbiage is potentially worrisome when placed in the context of the administration’s recent redefinition and expansion of the term “enemy combatant.” Basically, as long as Obama and his advisers think that you do or could eventually pose a threat to the nation, you are engaged in combat with the nation.
While the cause of freedom may not yet be completely restored, Rand Paul certainly brought the issue to the public consciousness. We have not heard the last inquiries into the administration’s drone policy, and hopefully we have not heard the final clarifications by the attorney general on its behalf. The filibuster proved that protecting civil liberties is a winning issue, especially for the Republican Party. The cynic will say that Republicans only support reigning in executive power insofar as it vitiates Obama’s authority. The pragmatist will say that it hardly matters. It is perhaps too much to expect the self-interested American politician to embrace the notion of libertas gratia libertatis. But I’ll take libertas gratia civilitatis any day. In this case, the means justify the ends—as long as liberty is protected, the American people are in a better place.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the days before the 2003 Iraq invasion, General David Petraeus provided a telling quotation to a journalist. “Tell me how this ends,” he asked, and 10 years later, we are still not really sure.
March 20 marks the 10-year anniversary of a war commonly considered the worst decision in the history of U.S. foreign policy since Vietnam. The expected commentaries and reflections have appeared in the past month within the academic and policy wonk circles. Political blogger Andrew Sullivan, for example, has extensively evaluated his own support for the Iraq War, and many of his journalistic colleagues have followed suit.
Alternately, academics like Harvard Kennedy School Professor Stephen Walt have emphasized the small minority who did not support the invasion. He has also noted the conspicuous absence of these dissidents from prominent positions in the U.S. foreign policy community. Although many have had illustrious and notable careers as academics, few have served the U.S. government in an official capacity.
Those who supported the war, though, have held significant positions throughout the Department of Defense, Department of State, and other U.S. government agencies. Notably, this trend has not changed under the administration of President Obama, whose opposition to the war helped propel him into the national spotlight in the first place.
For these reasons, among others, it is particularly striking that the U.S. foreign policy community ignored a needed opportunity for introspection about the events that led to the Iraq War. More than anything else, the war has become a footnote within America’s march through the course of history. While not yet forgotten entirely, the lessons of Iraq remain unheard.
This was particularly evident during the confirmation hearings of Senator Chuck Hagel for the Secretary of Defense. Amidst an aggressive smear campaign, the line of questioning about Iran’s nuclear program showed that the ideological foundations of the Iraq War remain strong within the halls of the Capitol.
The Bush administration primarily justified its actions within Iraq on the basis of preventive war, as opposed to preemptive war. Within international law, a state can legally use force without first being attacked only if the opposing state presents an imminent threat. If the United States knew that North Korea, for example, had the capabilities and intentions to strike the United States with a nuclear weapon, the U.S. could legally target North Korean missiles sites as a preemptive measure.
Preventive war, however, argues that a state may justify the use of force against another state because that state may in the future pose an imminent threat, even if the state does not yet have the capability to conduct a credible strike.
It is a troubling argument that rests itself on the shifting sands of the hypothetical. And the Iraq War showed the full extent of costs in an engagement in which the benefits remain solely hypothetical. Over time, the United States became engaged within a foreign, sectarian conflict that consumed resources, time, and, most importantly, lives, over a fear that never actually materialized.
The recent debate about Iran’s nuclear weapons program, particularly within the more conservative elements of the Republican Party, demonstrates that the Iraq War did not sufficiently disprove the risks implicit within the doctrine of preventive war. And a significant part of this continuation stems from the dominance of ideological over strategic interests within the U.S. foreign policy community.
Neoconservative ideologies dominated the Republican Party in the development of the Iraq War. And similar ideologies still maintain a stronghold over the party today, even if it identifies itself differently.
Granted, some have argued that Senator Rand Paul’s recent filibuster has provided a symbolic victory for realism, but it can only represent the beginning of a long fight against an entrenched system of beliefs. Much like the debates over the future of the Republican Party after the 2012 elections, it will be a brutal and potentially futile affair.
Yet if the ideology that made the Iraq War possible still exists today, it only makes sense to assume that it could cause further conflicts in the future.
Much like our involvement in Vietnam, Iraq may very well remain a haunting period of our history, extensively studied but rarely analyzed. While individuals may introspectively evaluate their decisions at the time, their efforts can only succeed in further prevention if applied on a larger scale.
Ten years later, we already know how this ends. Now we just need to hear what happened.

The U.S. Department of the Navy awarded University President Drew G. Faust with its highest civilian honor two weeks ago, Harvard announced this week.
Navy Secretary Ray E. Mabus presented the Navy Distinguished Public Service Award to Faust in a surprise ceremony in his Pentagon office for her “total commitment to the NROTC [Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps].”
The presentation took place in a private ceremony during Faust’s visit to Washington, D.C., on Feb. 27 and 28. The primary purpose of the trip was to dissuade lawmakers from allowing the sweeping budget cuts known as sequestration to into effect, but she attended several unrelated events as well, including the ceremony with Mabus.
“I was surprised and honored by the award,” Faust said in a statement. “I am proud of the renewed relationship that we have established with ROTC, and am deeply grateful for the men and women, some of them our students, who heed the call to public service by serving in our armed forces.”
According to a U.S. Navy website, nominations for Distinguished Public Service Awards “are limited to those extraordinary cases where individuals have demonstrated exceptionally outstanding service of substantial and long-term benefit to the Navy and/or the Marine Corps.”Past recipients of the award include prominent journalists, lawyers, and politicians.
In 1926, Harvard became one of the first universities to implement a Naval ROTC program, but the program was dismantled during the Vietnam War. Following the repeal of “don’t ask, don’t tell,” a policy that barred openly gay and lesbian service members in the armed forces, Faust formally recognized the NROTC in March 2011. The step marked the end of over 40 years of tension between the University and the military. A year later, the University officially welcomed back the Army Senior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps as well.
Columbia and Yale also reinstated ROTC programs on their campuses in the months after the repeal of “don’t ask, don’t tell.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A colorful mob of undergraduates dressed in mascot costumes shattered the usual morning stillness of Harvard Yard early Thursday morning, forsaking sleep and studying to partake in the cherished Harvard tradition of Housing Day.
As students, tutors, and House Masters waited for the envelopes that concealed the names of their Houses’ new residents, the crowd in Harvard Yard was swept up in a wave of shouts and cheers of pride that awoke many anxious freshmen.
“It was crazy. I didn’t need my alarms this morning,” Jordan H. Hayashi ’16 said.
Adams House Master John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67 was seen lifted upon the shoulders of his students, cheering loudly for his House, while the John Harvard statue was draped in a Kirkland t-shirt.
For stressed-out students, the scene was a pleasant interlude in the heat of midterm season.
Students of the Class of 2016 in particular were captured in the excitement of Housing Day, eager to learn where they will live for the next three years.
“It was excellent, the best thing ever,” said Mercedes N. Flowers ’16, who was assigned to Eliot House. “We convinced ourselves that anything would be great.”
Some freshmen said they were apathetic about Housing Day before Thursday’s festivities, but saw their enthusiasm grow as the moment of revelation approached.
“I felt really neutral about it up until today,” said Advik Shreekumar ’16, a future resident of Leverett House. “I woke up this morning and went to my [blockmates]’s room, and that’s when I got excited, seeing everyone in the Yard. A high-energy moment was seeing the Leverett bunny.”
The festivities in the Yard extended throughout the morning and afternoon. Outside Annenberg, several rabbits—representing the Leverett bunny—were hopping around in enclosures, available for petting.
Inside Annenberg, representatives from the 12 Houses cheered and rallied their new residents together, handing out House paraphernalia and shirts.
“The little party in Annenberg was really cool,” said James R.M. Watkins ’16. “I’m over the moon about Lowell.”
Other students were unsure what to expect.
“You hear about [Housing Day] from proctors, and they can’t describe the intensity,” Nicolas Rossenblum ’16 said. He remarked that he felt the intensity “as soon as the upperclassmen started running around.”
Some students assigned to the Quad tried to combat negative perceptions of their new home on campus.
“At first I was thinking that this was not going to be the most spectacular way to live. Then I realized a lot of my other friends also got quadded,” said Eamon C. O’Brien ’16, who was assigned to Pforzheimer House. “We can create a community. The hardest thing to get used to will be the shuttle.”
While many students said the day had been exciting, others were unsure how to respond to the flurry of emotions and chatter exchanged throughout the day.
“When people say congrats or I’m sorry, you don’t know how to respond,” said Maya M. Park ’16, who was assigned to Dunster House.
Students said the Housing Day experience was transcendental.
“I felt like we weren’t real students before today,” said Aliya G. Itzkowitz ’16.
Madeleine W. Smith ’16 agreed: “We haven’t been this excited since we got in [to Harvard].”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three decades ago, when customers entered what is now UpStairs on the Square, some assumed that the woman who greeted them was only there to take reservations. But in fact, Mary-Catherine Deibel welcomed the guests to her restaurant.
In 1982, Deibel, as the co-owner and co-founder of the longstanding Harvard Square restaurant, represented an exception to the male-dominated business community.
This month, Deibel’s name along with 116 others was published in the Harvard Square Business Association’s annual list of women business owners, which is released each March in honor of Women’s History Month.
HSBA Executive Director Denise A. Jillson estimates that about 10 percent of Harvard Square businesses are currently owned or directed by women.
These women, who run eclectic shops and outlets scattered throughout the Square, have carved out space in a historically male-dominated profession and community. Today, in an environment in which they are still a minority, they have turned to entrepreneurship and developed partnerships to survive and thrive.
BREAKING TRADITION
Each day at work, Jillson revisits Harvard Square’s male-dominated roots. Her desk faces a photo on the wall of a 1941 golf outing of the Square’s businessmen. While the picture could suggest an enduring patriarchal legacy, to Jillson, it serves as a reminder of the great strides taken by women in a profession previously out of their reach.
“There are definitely more businesswomen now in the Square than when I came here in the ’80s,” said Paul J. MacDonald, owner of the iconic Leavitt & Peirce tobacco shop that has stood witness to the evolving demographic of Harvard Square for more than a century.
The growing number of female entrepreneurs in recent decades coincides with the HSBA’s historical shift toward welcoming women into the Association. The HSBA, founded in 1910 as the Harvard Square Business Men’s Association, originally barred women from becoming members.
Only in the early 1970s amid the increased pressure for women’s rights did the Association abandon the “Men’s” qualifier and welcome women leaders.
The HSBA itself currently reflects the increased gender balance among Harvard Square business owners. Its board has exclusively been led by a woman since the first executive director was hired in the 1980s.
Today’s HSBA continues to embrace the young businesswomen who are changing the face of Harvard Square. Eight of the 18 current board members are women, several of whom are young entrepreneurs.
“When [women] arrive on the scene, they immediately like to get involved in the community,” Jillson said. “These women are young, sitting on the board, and really making an impact on the Square.”
RIGHT JOB, RIGHT PLACE
MacDonald emphasized the importance of bringing entrepreneurs and small businesses to Harvard Square.
“You need to protect the Square and keep it vibrant,” MacDonald said. “And you do that by bringing in independent businesses.”
Numerous women have done just that by choosing Harvard Square as the ideal location to open new businesses or bring their already existing ones.
Brooke Garber, the co-founder and co-owner of Mint Julep clothing boutique, said she always felt a passion for small businesses and entrepreneurship, having grown up in a small town lined with family-owned businesses. Garber and her business partner Stephanie Nist opened their first store in Brookline, Mass., in 2004 and arrived in Harvard Square two years later.
“Harvard Square is a place that really embraces small businesses,” Nist said. “You get such a variety of people, but it also has that small community feel, which is hard to find.”
Rachel A. Wentworth, co-founder and co-owner of lingerie boutique Forty Winks, traveled a similar path to entrepreneurship. Wentworth worked in retail before opening her own store with business partner Meredith W. Donaldson in April of 2010.
“I knew that I wanted to open my own business some day,” Wentworth said. “I always wanted to do my own thing and have control over what I did during the day.”
Having previously worked in a more regimented corporate environment, Nist said that the greatest appeal of owning a business is the flexibility it provides. She added that entrepreneurship has a particularly vital function in the lives of women by allowing them to own a business and also care for their families.
Deibel, who lauded the increase in the percentage of businesswomen in Harvard Square since her arrival in the 1980s, said she sees this expansion of female entrepreneurship as the result of a new mindset.
“I think that women have way more confidence and just expect to own the world right now,” Deibel said.
But owning the world still comes at a different price for men and women. Deibel said the income disparity between men and women still astonishes her, and the gender wage gap is one of multiple reasons why entrepreneurship can be increasingly appealing to women.
“If everybody was getting paid the same amount, there wouldn’t be an issue,” Deibel said. “That’s the reason to be an entrepreneur, since you don’t have to worry about that.”
FACING CHALLENGES TOGETHER
Female entrepreneurs may not grapple with wage discrepancies or a restrictive schedule, but the businesswomen of Harvard Square are not immune to challenges.
Deibel recalled having to contend with the preconceptions of the patriarchal business world for several years after opening her restaurant, as wine salesmen and other vendors often failed to realize that she was the owner.
Despite progress in the gender gap of the business world over the past three decades, recent entrepreneurs Wentworth and Garber echoed Deibel’s sentiments when recounting the obstacles they faced at the outset of starting their businesses.
Wentworth noted that, despite having good financials and a business plan for Forty Winks, she and her partner found it difficult to rent space in Harvard Square.
“We were young. We were women. We had no established business before the store. So we definitely had to fight a bit harder to be taken seriously,” she said.
Renting a storefront has been one of the main impediments for young entrepreneurs. Nist said that she and Garber had to wait until their first location was a success before settling in the pricier Harvard Square area.
While discussing the obstacles that businesswomen contend with, Garber referenced the career woman’s ongoing struggle for balance.
“Women always carry the weight of the world,” Garber said. “Being able to balance your life is definitely the most challenging thing.”
Several of Harvard Square’s businesswomen have found partnership to be an effective way of mitigating some of these challenges.
Nist said that within her female entrepreneurial network, approximately half of the businesses are run by pairs. The division of responsibilities, combination of talents, and ability to receive a second opinion are all boons of partnership.
Nist added that the psychological dimension of having a co-owner relieves some of the stress involved with the risks of entrepreneurship.“You’re taking the plunge with someone else, and that makes it so much easier,” she said.
Local support for female entrepreneurs comes from partnership, the HSBA, and a now diversified community of established business owners and new arrivals.
With 117 woman-led businesses in the Square, female entrepreneurs have developed a network to maintain the strength of their growing community. “We hope to continue to see that grow,” Jillson said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Amidst rowdy campus-wide Housing Day celebrations, a group of math-loving students and professors held a party of their own in the Science Center math common room Thursday to mark Pi Day, the March 14 holiday that represents the first three digits of the mathematical constant pi.
The event, organized by the Harvard Undergraduate Mathematics Association, gave students and faculty an opportunity to discuss math while  celebrating the study of numbers in a lighthearted atmosphere.
The event began with a recitation contest in which students recalled as many digits of pi from memory as possible while impressed onlookers gorged on five flavors of pie and ice cream. Attendees’ memories varied vastly—one person remembered only one digit, while others recited more than 200.
David J. Liu ’15 said he began memorizing pi in eighth grade after his math teacher promised him that he could throw a pie at his teacher’s face if he memorized 100 digits of pi. On Thursday, Liu belted out 205 digits of the mathematical constant.
Defending champion Samantha J. Whitmore ’13, who successfully recalled pi to 224 digits, once again took the top spot in Thursday’s competition. Whitmore has attended and won three pi-reciting contests this year alone.
Shifting gears, the room hushed when mathematics professor Noam D. Elkies began performing a piano composition he wrote eight years ago that encodes the first 244 digits of pi.
At 3:14 p.m., the pie-eating contest began. Participants employed various strategies to consume as much pie as possible in 3 minutes and 14 seconds. Some chowed down on their pies like pizzas while others daintily used forks and knives.
William H. Marks ’12-’13, an inactive Crimson business editor, was declared the winner after eating 1 and 1/16 of a pie. When asked how he felt about winning the pie-eating contest, Marks responded “really full,” and said that he was representing Mather House in the contest.
Visiting mathematics professor William W. Dunham concluded the nerdy festivities with a talk called “A Celebration of Pi,” in which he sketched the story of mathematicians who hunted for the digits of pi as well as Leonhard Euler’s solutions to the Basel Problem, in which pi plays a critical role.
Attendees said they enjoyed the opportunity to meet others interested in math at the event—and also remarked on the excellent free dessert.
Isabel M. Vogt ’14 said the food was “delicious” and noted the “impressive spread of pies ranging from blueberry to pumpkin.”
William Z. Chen ’14 enjoyed the “fantastic” talk about the history of math, which allowed him to see “how historical figures in math interacted with each other.”
For Chen, the coupling of Housing Day and Pi Day made this the best Pi Day of his life. “There is so much awesomeness and cheering and food. I skipped classes today to do Housing day and Pi Day, and I don’t regret it,” Chen said.

The new Harvard College Summer Humanities and Arts Research Program, or SHARP, will launch this summer with the goal of filling a gap in research opportunities for students of the arts and humanities.
The 10-week pilot program will give approximately 12 students the opportunity to work on research projects, which emphasize direct collaboration between students and faculty members.
“Everybody seems to think that the focus is on science. Clearly, there are more options in science, because those options come from a lot of different places,” said Gregory A. Llacer, director of Harvard’s Office for Undergraduate Research Initiatives. “For the arts and humanities, even outside Harvard, there aren’t a whole lot of opportunities.”
SHARP is intended to level the playing field for students with diverse research interests. Interested students can apply to work on one of SHARP’s four interdisciplinary projects, which range from a digital mapping venture to the processing of a collection of informal publications at Widener Library.
In one of these projects, students led by philosophy professor Sean D. Kelly will design a philosophy curriculum for elementary and high school students.
Jeffrey Berg, assistant director at Harvard’s Office of Postgraduate and National Fellowships, said that Kelly’s project is intended to attract students interested in both philosophy and education. “Even the philosophy-focused project...isn’t just for philosophy students,” Berg said. “It’s for students who have an interest in philosophy but who are also looking to engage with elementary and high school students.”
Program officials said they hope SHARP students will engage with other undergraduate researchers on campus during the program.
“People are going to think about research in their own disciplinary field in a different way by virtue of having these really compelling experiences with people way outside their own discipline.” Llacer said.
Kelly said that although there is still work to be done in creating more research opportunities for students of the arts and humanities, he believes Harvard is moving in the right direction.
“I think that the administration and [Diana Sorensen, divisional dean of arts and humanities] are trying hard to make sure they support students in the arts and humanities,” said Kelly.
Llacer said he hopes SHARP will attract the interest of faculty and students, allowing for future expansion.
SHARP is a collaboration between the Arts and Humanities Division and the Office for Undergraduate Research Initiatives.
The fledgling program falls under the umbrella of Harvard’s Summer Undergraduate Research Village, which includes research programs such as the Behavioral Laboratory in the Social Sciences (BLISS), the Program for Research in Science and Engineering (PRISE), and the Program for Research in Markets and Organizations (PRIMO), catered to students interested in business research.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Boston Redevelopment Authority board voted Thursday to unanimously approve Harvard’s controversial proposal to move its campus services facilities to 28 Travis St. in North Allston, according to a report in the Boston Globe.
The approval of the plan means that Harvard’s mailroom services, Harvard University Information Technology, Harvard University Police Department training facilities, recycling and storage, and “fleet management services” will temporarily relocate from 219 Western Ave. to 28 Travis St. before the start of the 2013-2014 academic year. At recent Harvard-Allston Task Force meetings, Allston residents have repeatedly voiced concern that the Travis Street location is an inappropriate site for the facilities because it is too close to a residential neighborhood.
The board approved the relocation proposal, which has been repeatedly revised over the past few months in response to community feedback, under the condition that Harvard complies with a list of terms outlined at the meeting, according to the Globe.
Under these terms, Harvard must begin planning in April for the construction of Rena Park—a public space adjacent to the Travis Street facility—and begin work on the park in 2014. Harvard must also prohibit vehicular activity at the Travis Street location between the hours of midnight and 6 a.m. The terms also state that Harvard must finalize plans for again moving campus services to a different location within one year of completing its planned science complex, according to the Globe.
These terms are similar to conditions submitted by the Task Force last week as well as those proposed by earlier this week by Boston mayor Thomas M. Menino.
If Harvard fails to abide by these requirements, the BRA may restrict occupancy permits for Harvard’s development projects in the future.
The facility at 28 Travis St. is part of Harvard’s larger plans for development in Allston. The University also plans to construct a new science complex, a new basketball arena, and a hotel and conference center, among other things, over the next 10 years. Harvard previously halted construction in Allston following the 2009 economic downturn. The 28 Travis St. facility will be Harvard’s first completed project in Allston since the University announced that it was resuming construction in the area last summer.
The relocation of campus services to Travis Street will open up the 219 Western Ave. site for the development of a residential and retail commons at Barry’s Corner, which sits at the intersection of North Harvard Street and Western Avenue. Plans for the commons are slated to go before the BRA board for review next month.

Senior Associate Provost for the Harvard Library Mary Lee Kennedy will leave Cambridge this May to lead the New York Public Library as its Chief Library Officer, Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 announced Friday.
“This is a wonderful opportunity for Mary Lee to use her many talents to pursue longstanding interests,” Garber wrote in a letter to the Harvard community. “I am grateful to Mary Lee for all she has accomplished at Harvard, for her collaborative and dedicated approach to her job, and for being a valued member of my leadership team. It has been a great pleasure to me personally to have worked with her since I arrived as Provost.”
Kennedy, who first came to Harvard in 2004, began her work at the University as the Executive Director of Knowledge and Library Services at Harvard Business School before taking on the role of Senior Associate Provost in 2011. Along with Library Executive Director Helen Shenton, Kennedy oversaw the centralization of Harvard’s 73 libraries into a single Harvard library. At times that transition, which was completed last August, was criticized for a perceived lack of transparency and for prompting fear of staff reductions among workers.
In his letter, Garber pointed to several Library accomplishments during Kennedy’s tenure, including the implementation of its new “shared services” structure, the launch of an innovation initiative that included the Labrary—an experimental learning space, and the development of new library services such as a user feedback tool and a new online Library portal.
“Under Mary Lee’s leadership, the Harvard Library made considerable strides and is well positioned for future success,” Garber wrote.

Men’s basketball is not the only Harvard squad going dancing this week.
The No. 5 Crimson women’s hockey team will also be participating in the NCAA Tournament—albeit a much smaller one—beginning Saturday when it travels locally to face No. 4 Boston College at Kelley Rink.
With only eight teams in the bracket, a win would give Harvard its first Frozen Four birth since 2008.
Harvard (24-6-3) is coming off a heartbreaking 2-1 loss at No. 2 Cornell in the ECAC Championship Game last weekend, when a late slashing penalty on senior defenseman Sarah Edney gave the Big Red a power play opportunity, which it took advantage of by tallying the game-winning goal with 1:40 to go.
“That one stung,” co-captain Jillian Dempsey said. “But it is amazing to know that we have another chance to make a go at things.”
Indeed the Crimson does, as Harvard earned an at-large berth to its first tournament since 2010 following a season in which it reached as high as No. 2 in the country.
If Harvard is going to be successful in that tournament, it will need freshman goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer to stay hot.
After recording two shutouts in four games, the rookie was named the ECAC Tournament Most Outstanding Player. During the regular season, she ranked third in the country in goals against average; no other freshman ranked in the top twenty.
Though Maschmeyer spent most of that time platooning in net with co-captain Laura Bellamy—who ranks second in the nation in saves and goals against average—the rookie appears to have earned the postseason starting job.
“[Maschmeyer’s] been incredible for us all year,” co-captain Jillian Dempsey said. “We set the bar really high and she has done more than we asked of her.”
The freshman made a career-high 34 saves in the teams’ last meeting on Feb. 5, in the first round of the Beanpot.  But she surrendered a pair of goals in the final 12:38 to allow Boston College to rally back from a third-period deficit to top the Crimson, 2-1.
On Saturday, the Harvard offense will likely need to score more than once to take down the Eagles, who rank second in the country with 4.40 goals per game.
Harvard’s defense, which ranks second in the nation in its own right, has often been up to the task this year and has allowed just 1.15 goals per contest.
Edney received first-team All-Ivy honors last weekend, while fellow defenseman Michelle Picard was named an honorable mention.
Those two will be among the group helping Maschmeyer try to fend off the Boston College attack, which is led by sophomore forward Alex Carpenter, whose 68 points on 37 goals and 31 assists placed her fifth in the country this year.
Freshman Haley Skarupa (23 goals, 27 assists) and sophomore Emily Field (15 goals, 29 assists) give the Eagles three of the nation’s top 20 leading scorers, making them the only team in the nation besides No. 1 Minnesota to boast that distinction.
Things could get especially interesting on the power-play. The Crimson features the nation’s best penalty kill, but the Eagles are second in the country in power-play percentage.
Leading the Harvard attack will be Dempsey, who was a unanimous first-team All-Ivy selection following a season in which she ranked 11th in the country with 24 goals.
The senior was one of ten standouts initially named a finalist for the Patty Kazmaier award, given to the nation’s best player. But that list was recently narrowed to three members of the Gophers, who have not lost or tied any of their 33 contests this season.
Assuming Minnesota can get past Mercyhurst, whom it faces in its NCAA first round contest, the Crimson would have the chance to hand the Gophers their first loss of the season in the semifinals, which take place on Minnesota’s home ice.
But to get there, Harvard must take down its local rival first.
Though the Crimson holds a 36-13-0 edge in the all-time series against Boston College, it is just 6-8 in the NCAA tournament all-time.
The two squads have never met in the postseason, but with a Frozen Four bid on the line, the Crimson is ready to give the Eagles its best shot.
“We have a lot to look forward to,” Maschmeyer said. “We just have to stick to what we know.”

Launched in a Kirkland dorm room, Facebook is now seeking 7,000 square feet of office space in the Kendall Square area, reports the Boston Business Journal.
The new office space would be just a few miles from Harvard Square, and from the Phoenix Club, which may now find itself becoming Zuckerberg's personal ping pong room.
 
The billion-user social networking company would staff the office with three dozen new engineers over the next six months as it attempts to gain a foothold in an area that is already home to Microsoft, Google, Nokia, and, of course, MIT.
 
To the dismay of Harvard CS enthusiasts, Facebook closed its last permanent outpost in Cambridge in 2006, two years after its infamous migration to Silicon Valley.
 
Despite Facebook's role in distracting us, bringing back the word "like," making online relationships a thing, and otherwise taking over our lives, we seem to "like" when the company pays homage to its Harvard roots, so it's a pity they'll be two T-stops away.
 
Putting aside reasons of nostalgia, it does make sense that Zuckerberg wants Facebook's presence to Cambridge to be outside of the Harvard bubble this time around. A 70 square foot suite in Kirkland isn't cool. You know what's cool? A 7,000 square foot office.

Every week, The Crimson publishes a selection of articles that were printed in our pages in years past.
March 9, 1918: War Taking Heavier Toll of University 
War has exacted from the ranks of University graduates and undergraduates a heavier toll during the past winter than it did throughout the first six months following the entrance of the United States into the European conflict. The University War Record Office announces that since October the list of casualties among the University's men engaged in active service contains 12 deaths, as compared with 10 in the months from April 6 through September and 36 before the declaration of war by the United States. This brings the losses of University men since August, 1914, to a total of 58.
 
March 14, 1923: Liberals Take Stand Against Restriction
In view of the discussion that has lately been aroused by suggestions to restrict admission to the University, a meeting of the Liberal Club was recently held to consider whether this was the kind of question on which the club wished to take a stand. Hitherto the Liberal Club has endorsed no policy save that of free speech. At this meeting, however, the club adopted the following resolution by a vote of 28 to 7: "Resolved: That in the opinion of the Student Liberal Club of Harvard University any limitations which may be placed upon admission to Harvard University should not be based upon the race or religion of the applicants for admission."
March 15, 1946: 900 Crowd Into New Lecture Hall To Hear Auden Recite Own Poetry 
Hooting, screaming, caterwauling, over 900 students flooded suddenly out of Emerson D Wednesday and raced vigorously towards the New Lecture Hall with the peculiarly startling cry of "audenaudenauden." The recipient of this gratitude, affection, and inspiration eased down into a chair in St. Clair's, with the summary, "It was rather frightening." 

March 11, 1977: Women Hold Up Half the Sky
This past Tuesday went unnoticed by most of Harvard, no break in classes, nothing unusual. Had it been Columbus Day, or Saint Patrick's Day, or the fourth of July, Harvard would have taken notice. So why was this day different from all other days? It was International Working Women's Day, a holiday forgotten or unheard of by most people at Harvard. Did anyone know? Did anyone care? Who understands what it stands for? Every child in America learns what Columbus Day stands for...
