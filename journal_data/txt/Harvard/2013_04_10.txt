After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If I’ve learned anything from my childhood, it’s that you can achieve anything that you put your mind to. If you want it badly enough, you can find a way to achieve it.  The way movies framed it, part of growing up—your coming of age—was to realize that you are capable in every sense, and to capitalize on it.
I would think about this a lot in high school, when applying for extracurricular positions or finishing papers late into the night. When I did do well, it was a justification of what I believed in—it gave me the motivation to work harder. It came to be an incredible thrill, a funny sort of recklessness, to see how far I could push myself.
I continued freshman year. I felt empowered utilizing my twenty minutes on the T to study, or going out Saturday night then waking up at 6 a.m. to do work. I can’t remember if I ever truly cared about any of this, but I felt a high seeing how efficient I could be. I was functioning at a whole new level, in which I could do everything, and do everything well.
Eating was the one part of my life that was uncontrollable. I struggled with bulimia. It was two to four hours of extreme, disgusting excess: too much food, too much emotion. Those were hours I would try to remember later—how many loaves had I finished? Did I really drink four liters of water? Had I cried? I would struggle terrifically, then wash up and go to a meeting. This physical and mental sloppiness happened at least a few times a week. But I did all I could do at the time, which was to simply contain it.
Classes were going well, and I found a great group of friends. My life increasingly diverged. I compartmentalized my school life more and more, only to spend hours alone reeling with physical pain. But still, in some ways, I was performing even better than I had before. I found more and more ways to cut back on sleep and socializing; I reset the bar of being “functional.”
But that all changed when my standing as a student became in jeopardy. Looking back, I genuinely believe I did all that I could at the time to overcome bulimia. It became another chance to excel. I tried about 15 different breathing exercises. (I was deliberately attempting to relax far more often than I actually was relaxing.) I gave myself a timetable for recovery. I felt selfish, pained, and burdensome to my friends. I had to get better, or else. I didn’t know what would come next.
Yet “next” is where I found myself just a few months later. Things didn’t get better. I couldn’t stop purging; cold water hurt my teeth. I still got unpredictably, deeply depressed. Freshman fall’s schoolwork had gone well enough, in my eyes, but I was failing so miserably at what mattered most: being functional enough to stay in school.  It was especially painful watching myself fall apart while knowing how hard I had tried.  I ended up having to go home for the rest of spring semester, which for me spelled out the end of normal life as I knew it.
It took all of six months to tackle the groundwork of recovery, and it was the most difficult thing I’ve ever done. A lot of it was quiet realizations: that I wasn’t super-human, that achievements were fleeting, and that sustaining a quality of life was a responsibility. It was the opposite of the exhaustion had gotten me through high school and freshman year.
Recently I found the quote, attributed to Marilyn Monroe: “Sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together.” In retrospect, I very much believe so. I know that what I may have lost has been more than made up in what I have since found. While I can’t quite tally it all up, despite every time things didn’t go as planned—having to go on leave being only one example—, so much good has happened since. I found a wonderful group of girls to block with, who support me and genuinely care. I have found the concentration I love, and with the time formerly devoted to bulimia, I have been able to find moments of peace and quiet.
And I still believe that I anything is possible. I still believe that if I try hard enough, I can achieve whatever it is I’m looking for. But what I want is very different, and I understand that achieving my material goals has little relation to the kind of person I am. At a place like Harvard, a community that thrives on superlatives—the smartest, the best, the brightest—it is easy, if not necessary, to believe that our initiative to control the quantitative things around us makes us successful. Through bulimia, I’ve come to realize that I’m not in control of everything. And maybe it’s something I’ve known deep down all along.
But at last I can say I’m truly happy about it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Rutgers head basketball coach Mike Rice threw balls at players when they were out of position during practice. He shoved and kicked them when they failed to perform to perfection. He called them fa—s when they did not play tough enough for his liking. Video footage of these actions, aired on ESPN’s “Outside The Lines” on April 2, ultimately led to Rice’s firing. The footage caused a national uproar, with New Jersey governor Chris Christie joining the calls for Rice’s termination.
When I first watched the video, however, I was not shocked. I was not appalled. I was not even surprised. This is not because I did not recognize Rice’s actions as disgusting and abusive; it was because I had seen it all before.
Playing competitive sports throughout my childhood, I saw all of these actions, including and especially the use of homophobic slurs, displayed by at least one of the coaches I played for over the years. These behaviors were never effective coaching methods, but they were ever-present throughout my time playing sports. It is not that I had come to condone this behavior; it is that I had come to expect it. Furthermore, I would be willing to bet that many of those who have played competitive sports long enough have had a somewhat similar experience. And this is precisely the problem.
This is why two of Rice’s former players at Rutgers have come out in support of their coach. They claimed that the ESPN footage had shown only Rice’s worst moments and that he was “not a guy we hated or despised.” These players respected Rice for pushing them to their limits, and were willing to overlook his violent, hateful outbursts, likely because they too had seen it all before. It seems these players, like so many others involved in college sports today, have forgotten the true role and purpose of the coach.
The role of a coach is ultimately that of a motivator. To get the most out of their players, especially at high levels of play, all coaches must walk a thin line between being tough and being abusive. But it is important for coaches to consider the reason they are cracking down on their players. Coaches are supposed to build character in their players. College coaches, especially, are supposed to be molding boys and girls into men and women, teaching lessons of life alongside lessons of basketball. To accomplish this, it is paramount that they administer discipline in a responsible and appropriate manner. Instead, coaches like Rice are teaching players that homophobia and violence can be overlooked as long as they are part of a package that breeds success in sport. Rice changed his role from that of a motivator to that of a petty tyrant, willing to dispense any sort of punishment so long as he believed it would engender winning on the court.
It is precisely this misunderstanding of a coach’s goal as winning at all costs that leads to coaches “disciplining” players in an abusive manner. It is the same misunderstanding that led the once-great Joe Paterno to cover up blatant sexual abuse within his organization for the sake of maintaining the Penn State football program’s reputation. Paterno and Rice may have committed different infractions, but both betrayed the sanctity of the image of the coach as a role model and a figure of strength in the eyes of young athletes.
Pundits have often lamented the poor off-the-field behavior of our college and professional athletes in recent years. Many have linked these behaviors to their glorification and idolization by fans, but I would argue that the character issues displayed by so many of today’s athletes can be largely attributed to the kind of coaching displayed by Rice and Paterno—the kind of coaching that exemplifies Nike’s latest slogan: “Winning takes care of everything.” It is true that as players mature and reach the professional level, coaches no longer hold much direct sway over their behavior, but that is why it is so vital that coaches teach their players the right lessons earlier—especially at the college level where student-athletes are shaping their adult identities.
Rice’s actions confirm what Paterno’s suggested—that the abuse of power by athletic coaches has become endemic in this country. Many of our coaches have become nothing more than petty tyrants. Because this country places such a high value on winning, both through praise and through money, coaches are willing to do whatever it takes to create a winning program—even if that means damaging the characters of the very players that win the games for them.
All this is not say that no value should be placed on winning. No true competitors in any sport play just for the fun of it. They play to win. The issue at stake is whether they are being taught to win in the right way. The job of the coach is to promote winning as a product of learning dedication, camaraderie and hard work, not to demand it through abuse and fear. And as often happens to coaches that care only about winning, Rice did not achieve any semblance of success on the court through his abusive regime. His Scarlet Knights finished 15-16 overall this year, failing to qualify for any postseason tournament.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past week, activists in the Cambridge area, including several Harvard students, protested in front of the Le Méridien hotel in support of its workers’ right to unionize. The Le Méridien is owned by HEI Hotels & Resorts, a controversial hospitality operator with a history of alleged employee mistreatment. Last April, on the heels of a review of HEI’s business practices, Harvard announced that they would decline to reinvest in the company. Although they attributed their decision to portfolio concerns, onlookers have taken the decision as a reaction to the accusations of worker mistreatment at HEI hotels. However, while that decision was praiseworthy at the time, it did little to combat the practices that have led laborers at Le Méridien to seek to improve their conditions. Today, these workers are still refused the basic right of unionization—and a boycott of the hotel, already backed by the Cambridge City Council, is wholly warranted. In fact, we believe that Harvard should also endorse such a measure.
Frank Lloyd Wright, the great American architect who served as inspiration for Ayn Rand’s Howard Roark, once said, “If capitalism is fair then unionism must be. If men have a right to capitalize their ideas and the resources of their country, then that implies the right of men to capitalize their labor.”  We agree. No one questions HEI’s right to own and operate hotels and resorts. Yet to prevent workers from using their only leverage point—their numbers—to improve their negotiating position strikes against basic notions of fairness.
Thankfully, Harvard recognizes the rights of workers to organize, and workers here can expect to earn above-average wages. Harvard should use its stature in the Cambridge community to ensure Le Méridien workers can enjoy the collective bargaining rights it grants to its own laborers. By joining the boycott, it can pressure HEI to adopt the policy of employer neutrality in the unionization process, a critical step to allowing a fair process.
While it can be difficult for the administration to exert influence in a corporation from which it has declined to reinvest, Harvard must not give up its responsibility to exert a positive force on worker treatment in Cambridge, where possible. It should also not forget employees of his own hotel, such as those who work at the Harvard-owned DoubleTree Suites hotel in Boston. As of now, these workers are also not unionized, although they have recently expressed interest in unionizing. In their statement of interest, DoubleTree workers petitioned, “We demand that the owner, Harvard University, and management of the DoubleTree Suites by Hilton Hotel Boston, respect our signatures and agree to a fair process for us to decide whether to have union representation without management interference and intimidation.” Harvard should do what it can to guarantee a fair unionization process for employees at the DoubleTree, and exert pressure on Le Méridien to do the same.
This article has been revised to reflect the following clarification:
CLARIFICATION: January 28, 2014
An earlier version of headline of this article and statements in the article stated that the DoubleTree Suites hotel is Harvard-owned. To clarify, the company is housed in a Harvard-owned building.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is troubling when what was once macabre metaphor leaps into reality. The Bard eerily foretold the drone debacle some four centuries ago, when, in King John, Phillip Falconbridge imagines that, “some airy devil hovers in the sky and pours down mischief.” And death.
President Obama, flagrantly trampling over campaign promises to “usher in a new era of open government,” is comfortable constructing a misinformation machine of Orwellian proportions. Any other country maintaining a policy of outright disavowal of hundreds of secret strikes, keeping a classified kill list that includes teenagers, and assassinating its own citizens without trial would have long ago been condemned by the U.S. as undemocratic and totalitarian. Hell, America might have even invaded it by now.
But surely, in light of national security concerns, my characterization of the administration’s policies as Orwellian is facile and hyperbolic? It’s not.
American officials artificially deflate civilian casualty counts in “signature” strikes by conveniently redefining combatant to mean anyone displaying suspicious intelligence signatures. In the words of the former US ambassador to Pakistan, Cameron P. Munter, “the definition of someone who can be targeted…is a male between the ages of 20 and 40.”
Redefining combatant to include anyone within the vicinity of a drone strike is pure doublethink: “Signature strike” is only the latest continuation of a shameful American tradition of corroding the English lexicon for political gain with disingenuous euphemisms like “enhanced interrogation” and “separate but equal.”
The deliberate duplicity of American intelligence agencies, or paramilitary, to be more accurate, led Senator Diane Feinstein, chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, to make the absurd assertion that the civilian casualties from drone strikes “each year has typically been in the single digits”—in direct contradiction with multiple independent researchers like the Human Rights Institute at Columbia Law School, which puts the body count of innocents in the hundreds.
Discounting its uncertain legal standing for the moment, the drone program is of dubious efficacy. What of the precedent set for international intervention with unmanned aerial vehicles for countries like Iran and China, the ill will caused by the killing of Pakistanis with mothers, fathers, and families, and the severe distrust in government by the citizens of Yemen, Pakistan, and Somalia, where leaders seem impotent and uncaring for allowing another country to run amok over sacred sovereignty?
Whatever gains made by the entire drone program in Pakistan are fruits of the poisonous tree—the result of a corrupt back-room deal in 2004. In exchange for America’s assassination of an inconvenient Taliban militant, weak-willed Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf gave license for the covert drone program that would go on to kill thousands.
It’s not that I have some superstitious mistrust of aerial weapons—only mistrust for an opaque military program, governed by either nonexistent or secret law, that trusts anonymous, high-level bureaucrats with the power to kill American citizens without a trial.
And it wasn’t long before the drone program metastasized into just that: the targeted killings of American citizens abroad without trials, in violation of the Fourth Amendment.  A recently revealed, disturbing Harry Kissinger quip rings too truly: “The illegal we do immediately; the unconstitutional takes a little longer.”
When President Obama allowed for the targeted killing of Anwar Al-Awlaki, the American imam turned Al-Qaeda propagandist operating from Yemen, in a drone strike in 2011 that also killed another American, Samir Khan, he radically claimed powers for the executive that seemed more in line with the troubled Bush era than Obama’s previous professorship of constitutional law.
A separate drone strike killed Al-Awlaki’s sixteen-year-old son, also an American citizen, two weeks later. When asked about the troubling trend, then Press Secretary Robert Gibbs glibly and self-assuredly suggested that the slain adolescent “should have [had] a far more responsible father.”
Nonsensically, the U.S. government currently requires a warrant signed by a judge to search a car or tap a phone (theoretically, anyway) but there is absolutely no judicial oversight of the drone program, and the Department of Justice asserted in a leaked white paper that it has the authority to kill U.S. citizens.
President Obama’s recent nomination of John O. Brennan as the director of the CIA points to an administration that is not only intent on continuing murky drone operations without judicial oversight, but a willful blindness towards the horrendous torture culture of the CIA allowed under President Bush while Brennan was a senior official. Obama has consistently refused to consider prosecution of torturers, and the woman directly responsible for the controversial and illegal destruction of interrogation tapes has been promoted instead of dismissed.
Despite all its soaring rhetoric on moving past war and torture, the Obama administration seems less concerned with civil liberties than even the Bush administration. That the capital “D” next to his name seems to silence criticism from fellow lawmakers makes him more dangerous than Bush ever was.

There are often crowds on the Widener steps on sunny Friday afternoons, but this month, they won’t just be clusters of tourists. This April, which is Islam Awareness Month, at exactly 1:03 p.m. each Friday, students of all faiths, opinions, and walks of life come together at Widener for Adhan, the Muslim call to prayer.
What is the Adhan? Omar A. Khoshafa ’16 explains, “The Adhan begins with four declarations that God is great, and that Muhammed is the messenger of God. It entreats you to come to good work and come to prayer.” According to Khoshafa, the concept of prayer has a very specific significance in Arabic. “It’s not the kind of prayer where you ask for something, like good exam scores, it’s more of a connection with God,” says Khoshafa.
Muslims, who pray five times daily, have chosen to do so on the Widener steps this month as an interfaith gesture. “These days the Adhan is portrayed in a negative manner. It’s associated with violence and terrorism, but our goal in doing the Adhan in the Yard is to say, ‘Hey, look! It’s not scary! Come learn what the Adhan actually means,’” says Muneeb Ahmed ’14, Vice President of the Harvard Islamic Society. “At one point, in the middle of this call to prayer, we had a circle of people standing. They were standing in respect, and we thought, we’ve accomplished our goal.”
Throughout April, the Harvard Islamic Society will be hosting events ranging from famous guest speakers to a poetry slam to engage people of all (or no) faiths in an open-minded conversation about Islam. “Islam sometimes has negative things associated with it, like violence and terrorism, but that’s not the true religion,” says Khoshafa. “It’s about peace and spirituality.”
“We have people with all sorts of opinions, socioeconomic backgrounds, and political views,” Ahmed says of the Muslim community at Harvard. “It’s a very diverse community, just like Harvard itself.” The Harvard Islamic Society consists of over 100 members, 40 to 50 of which are undergraduates who meet for prayer, dinner, and conversation on a weekly basis.
Islam Awareness Month may be the time when the group is most visible, but the Society remains an active community throughout the year. It hosts weekly halal dinners in Adams and Dunster Houses on Mondays and Thursdays and after Friday prayer. The Society also holds weekly Spirituality Nights on Fridays, which welcomes students of all faiths to discuss the Koran, the Bible, or anything spiritual.
“I’ve heard people say the Harvard Muslim community is very closed,” says Ahmed. “We’re very tight-knit, but I think ‘closed’ would be an incorrect assumption, because we accept people of all faiths and, within our faith, people of all opinions.”
Ahmed stresses the importance of combatting assumptions in favor of active inquiry. “If Islam Awareness Month leads to more questions, that’s good,” he says.
Harvard’s Islamic Awareness Month showcases high profile speakers, both Muslim and non-Muslim, like Imam Suhaib Webb of the Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center and former TED speaker Lesley Hazelton. Throughout the month, the Harvard Islamic Society also invites students of all faiths to hands-on activities, including a poetry night, a study break, and a dinner.
The study break welcomes all Harvard undergraduates to come experience what Ahmed calls a “display of Islamic culture.” Instead of speakers, the study break will be more social, and have hands-on booths, a great way to see what Ahmed describes as “the rich history and art that are inherent in Islam.”
The theme of the Society’s poetry night is “Express Your Spirituality!” “Spirituality transcends all faiths,” says Khoshafa. Any form of art, poetry, or spoken word is accepted.
“Last year we had Hebrew poems, Arabic poems, and even a rap song, all different types of things,” says Ahmed. “Whatever brings you closer to God, that’s the theme of it. Rapping brings you closer to God? That’s great.”
The month will close with the Harvard Islamic Society’s Spring Dinner, which mirrors the society’s other dinners in the fall.
The speaker will not be a member of the Harvard Islamic community. Instead, the Islamic Society has invited Professor of Comparative Religion and Indian Studies and co-House Master of Lowell, Diana L. Eck. “She is director of Harvard’s Pluralism Project, and I think in choosing her we’ve made a statement that the conversation between faiths doesn’t end on April 30,” says Khoshafa. “It should be a continuous conversation that ends in people appreciating other faiths, and coming to real tolerance and depth and understanding.”

Former Governor of Utah and former U.S. Ambassador to China Jon Huntsman, Jr. visited Harvard last week to join former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd for a forum discussion at the Institute of Politics called “China Rising.”
1. Fifteen Minutes: You’ve mentioned a need for a third party, what do you think such a party should look like or would look like?
JH: Well, ultimately the marketplace will decide whether there’s a need for a third party…and what it would look like. I’m in favor of a strong two-party system. I’d like to see the Republican Party reinvigorated for purposes of having a strong two-party system. If that doesn’t deliver for the American people then the marketplace will move us toward alternatives. I think there are a couple of election cycles left to see if the two-party system can in fact deliver for the American people. And as a lifelong Republican, I’d like to see it strengthened and reinvigorated, but ultimately the marketplace will sort that out.
2. FM: How long did it take you to decide to sign the gay marriage brief that was delivered to the Supreme Court?
JH: Well, ever since my first day in public office I’ve been in favor of equality under the law. And that has then moved closer and closer toward sort of officially embracing marriage equality. So when asked to sign on to the brief, I was… willing to do it. I had announced my support for civil unions as governor many, many years ago and before that while running as governor in the State of Utah 10 years ago.… I was in favor of reciprocal beneficiary rights. Sort of ill-defined at that point, but the purpose was to try to find some answers, some solutions to what I thought was an important concept, that being equality under the law for everybody. So I kind of went from my early political stages, to that, to supporting civil unions, to most recently signing on in support of the legal brief.
3. FM: If that legal brief had surfaced while you were seeking the Republican nomination [for President], would you have signed it at that point?
JH: Well I like to think that I’ve been pretty consistently in favor of equality under the law. I think that’s a conservative principle and I talked about equality under the law. I wasn’t rewarded for it during the primary. I used to talk about civil unions and my support for civil unions, but people evolve toward where we are today. I think this has been a very rapidly moving issue for a lot of people. I had given a lot of thought to the issue over the years…some parts it’s watching your friends who are denied maybe hospital visitation rights or equality under local laws where you like to see that remedied. You know, you don’t think about those things until you actually experience them through a friend. And do your views evolve and strengthen somewhat? Yeah they do. And I’m no exception to that rule.
4. FM: What do you wish you had done differently in your 2012 campaign, if anything?
JH: Taken second place in New Hampshire. Third place wasn’t quite good enough and the…marketplace expectation had put us at second.… The political marketplace is like the financial marketplace. It sets expectations, and our expectation was a second place finish. We finished third and that impacts fundraising, your.… market organizing, in this case South Carolina. So if we had to do it over again—we had one more week to go—we could have taken it from a third to a second.
5. FM: Now you’ve been a vocal critic of the GOP in its present form, can you summarize your criticisms for us?
JH: Well, as a lifelong member of the GOP, it shouldn’t always be taken as criticism, but rather constructive reasoning and proposed pathways and solutions for the future. That’s the only way that you can make something better, whether it’s my voice or a thousand other voices that care about a viable GOP. But getting back to a party that is courageous, visionary, and inclusive are all things that I’d like to see the party return to...where it has been in years past, whether under Abraham Lincoln in the 1860s or whether under Theodore Roosevelt earlier last century or in the 1950s under Eisenhower: big, bold, optimistic thinking about policies that are good for everybody, not just a subset of the American voters. And indeed the optimism and the courage that was displayed during the Reagan Administration. These are all elements that I think the party is capable of embracing and reconnecting with, but it’s going to take some sorting through the policy priorities and that’s done not by a party, but rather by candidates. So I think the biggest question going forward will be what kind of candidates do you have in the mix.… Are they able to actually redefine the parameters of what it means to be a Republican?
6. FM: Had 2012 gone a little bit differently, what people might have been on your running mate shortlist?
JH: Well, Stephen Colbert’s the only one I actually offered it to. And the last time I was on his show, I reminded him that he didn’t accept in time for South Carolina’s [primary]. So we were diminished by that. But beyond that, I never got that far.
7. FM: Will you seek a presidential nomination in 2016 on the Republican ticket or otherwise?
JH: Talking about running is putting the cart before the horse because I think the real discussion ahead is about policy priorities for the Republican Party. What will be the base and foundation of ideas that are talked about and do they in fact resonate with the American people? Are they issues that every American feels are pertinent and germane in their lives and feel some connection to? That then will answer who goes on to become a candidate. But we’re going to spend this year talking about ideas and issues. Where that takes us would be anybody’s guess today.

Professor David R. Liu ’94 and coworkers have reported a new synthetic method of directly building polymers by reading the genetic code off of DNA. According to Liu, this method could eventually lead to the discovery of useful new biological compounds.
The human body constantly reads genetic code off of DNA, otherwise know as deoxyribonucleic acid, onto RNA, or ribonucleic acid, and then uses ribosomes, cellular structures, to translate genetic code and build a chain of amino acids linked in a specific order. These molecular chains are called proteins. Because proteins are comprised of a series of linked molecular units, they are examples of molecular chains called polymers.
“The idea of trying to turn the information in DNA sequences into materials other than proteins has been an aspiration of chemists and chemical biologists for quite some time,” said Liu. “Previous efforts to use DNA to direct polymer synthesis have largely been limited to the synthesis of nucleic acids or nucleic acid-like polymers, such as DNA, RNA, or peptide nucleic acids, or PNA.”
This study, published in the journal Nature Chemistry, demonstrates for the first time a method of creating entire non-nucleic acid polymers directly from the code on DNA. Previously, non-nucleic acid polymers had to be built stepwise, by adding one new unit to the polymer’s end each time. In this method, building a ten-unit polymer would take ten separate steps. Using Liu’s method could reduce the number of steps and the time required.
“Biological polymers have many special properties, such as the ability to catalyze chemical reactions, to fold into specific shapes, and to have specific dynamic properties because of their precise sequence-defined structure,” Liu said. “Just like beads on a string, each building block is installed in a precise order to generate a biological polymer.”
The technique presented by Liu’s team works by attaching a piece of specifically coded PNA to a building block of a biological polymer. In this way, each unit of one type can be identified by a short PNA code. Several different PNA-labeled building blocks are then introduced into a system with DNA templates, which have been coded to match the PNA labels and order them precisely. Thus, the DNA lines up each separate building block in a sequence-defined order so the polymer chain is primed for attachment in one step.
Building such polymers is relatively easy due to the structural similarity of DNA and other nucleic acids, allowing them to bind naturally in a specific order. Using PNA “adapters” to bind these building blocks, Liu used a coded strand of DNA to put together any family of linkable blocks, regardless of structure.
Liu stated that the implications of this work lie in the ability to create libraries of millions or billions of these polymers and DNA templates more efficiently. Having these libraries would facilitate evolving these polymers. Liu’s group plans to screen these polymers for desirable properties, such as activation of certain genes, in a process that he said will approximate Darwinian evolution.

One day after the College Events Board and Harvard College Concert Commission released a joint statement reaffirming the choice of Tyga as Yardfest headliner, the artist responded publicly to the opposition at Harvard to his lyrics during an interview with a Los Angeles radio station Tuesday.
“At the end of the day, people have the right to have opinions [and] I have the right to say what I want in my music because it’s my music,” Tyga said during an interview with the hip hop radio station Power 106 FM. “If you don’t like it, don’t click on it, don’t download it.”
His comments come as students dissatisfied with the choice of artist continue to make alternative plans for Saturday evening’s concert.
Tyga described the opposition as “getting out of hand,” citing social media as among the causes for recent heightened scrutiny  of rap music.
“I make negative music, but I also make positive music, because that’s what thrown at me with life,” he said.
The announcement in late March that Tyga would be Yardfest’s main performer sparked protest in the Harvard community. A petition launched last week on Change.org describing Tyga’s song lyrics as “explicitly and violently misogynistic” has collected over 2,000 signatures since it went live.
The CEB and HCC, after re-evaluting the choice of artist, announced Monday that Tyga would still perform, but that the rapper would appear later in the evening so that students can hear the opening acts and eat dinner before he takes the stage.
Even with these modifications to the schedule, students opposed to the rapper’s performance have continued to solidify alternative plans.
Some students said they intend to spend their evening fulfilling extracurricular and academic commitments, while others had previously made plans to attend the spring concerts at other universities also slated for this coming weekend.
Chief among the alternatives offered on Harvard’s campus is a concert that will be held in the Eliot House courtyard featuring local pop and hip hop artist Shea Rose.
The event, planned by several Eliot students including Change.org petition founder Leah Reis-Dennis ’13 and Eliot House Committee co-chair Jayshlyn D. Acevedo ’14, will be funded and supported by the Eliot House Masters, the Eliot House budget, and the Office of Student Life, according to Reis-Dennis.
Acevedo stressed that the Eliot courtyard concert is not directly associated with the petition against Tyga and is not meant to act as a rival to Yardfest. She said that the concert organizers were “very transparent” in communicating their plans to the OSL and CEB, adding that ideally students would be able to attend both Yardfest and the Eliot concert if they so desired.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Massachusetts State Police said on Tuesday that they will file a criminal charge against Samuel J. Jackson, the driver who piloted a charter bus carrying Pennsylvania school children into the Western Avenue Bridge on the evening of February 2, injuring 39 students.
The crash came after Jackson failed to heed multiple signs that warned tall vehicles of underpasses’ low clearance. The bridge has a clearance of 10 feet.
The students were returning from a daytrip to Harvard sponsored by an organization that, as one part of its service, takes at-risk youth to college campuses.
State Police said Tuesday that Jackson will be criminally charged with negligent operation of his motor coach. He will also face civil violations for his failure to abide by warning signs on Soldiers Field Road, as well as for operating his coach on a Department of Conservation and Recreation roadway.
Renee N. Algarin, a spokesperson for the Suffolk County District Attorney’s Office, wrote in an email that an investigation of the crash included “an exacting report by trained State Police crash reconstruction experts, and a thoughtful examination of the investigators’ findings by senior prosecutors.”
She wrote that, after examining the evidence, the District Attorney’s office concluded that they should charge Jackson criminally.
To some, the charge against Jackson does not close the door on the incident. Desiree Goodwin, an assistant librarian with the Harvard Library System who was with the group before and after the crash, told The Crimson Tuesday that she believes a number of factors—including the design of the parkway—need to be considered in evaluating the crash.
The bridge has long been slated for a 2014 renovation, though it is unclear if the project will increase the clearance under the bridge.
“Why are those bridges at such a low level?” Goodwin questioned. “This isn’t the only bus that has crashed. It may be the most horrific accident, but it’s certainly not the only crash.”
“Still,” Goodwin said, “I think that a professional driver who has all those lives in his hands should be prepared for just about any kind of circumstance on the road. He should be alert for those signs.”
According to a Feb. 4 report in the Boston Globe, on the night of the crash the Western Avenue Bridge featured signs warning tall vehicles not to pass. However, it did not have the low hanging ‘Cars Only’ signs, which bump into oversized vehicles to warn drivers of the low clearance.
Media representatives for the State Police and the Department of Conservation and Recreation, the agency that manages Soldiers Field Road, could not be reached for comment on the signage as of press time on Tuesday night.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Pat Levitt, a neuroscience professor at the University of Southern California, discussed the ways early development shapes social behavior in a lecture Tuesday afternoon.
The lecture, titled “The Neurobiology of Social Behavior Development,” was part of the Harvard Center on the Developing Child’s Distinguished Scholars Lecture Series. Professor Jack P. Shonkoff, director of the Harvard Center on the Developing Child, moderated the event, which was co-sponsored by the The Conte Center at Harvard University.
Levitt began the lecture by summarizing the fundamentals of social behavior development, and then described his research on the relationship between differences in associative learning early in life with social abilities later in development.
Levitt studied the relationship between the abilities of infants to learn through classical conditioning and their social skills later in life, then conducted a similar study comparing the social behavior of mice.  He concluded that there is significant heterogeneity in both human and animal social development, and that these differences correlate with social behavior later on.
“Individual differences matter,” Levitt emphasized.
Levitt also discussed applications of his research to treatment of autism, emphasizing the importance of building social skills for people with autism early on as opposed to finding a concrete cure for the condition.
Levitt injected humor throughout the talk, eliciting laughter from the audience when he referenced his mother or displayed a photo-shopped picture of himself and colleagues.
“This is the mouse that’s like that kid in third grade who wouldn’t leave you alone,” Levitt joked as he showed a video of one of the more gregarious mice in his experiment.
A combination of Harvard undergraduates, graduate students, faculty members, and local residents attended the event, which was open to the general public. Boston resident Helen Ji Li, who has worked on research at Harvard, said she attended the event because it related to research she had done on the effects of China’s one child policy on child development.
“I think this can be extended as an ongoing dialogue, for not just people who are interested in early childhood but also for teachers and students to understand each other, because we’re all social,” she said.
Each year, the Center on the Developing Child invites one scholar who has made advancements in the field of child development to Harvard to give a lecture and spend time with Harvard faculty and students. Levitt, this year’s scholar, is Science Director of the National Scientific Council on the Developing Child.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly two and a half years after its originally slated release date, a database intended to increase the transparency of the Administrative Board process has yet to be made public.
Since first pushing back the release of the database in 2010, administrators have cited both confidentiality concerns and a heavy workload for the data’s continued delay. And this week, four months after Harvard resolved the last cases in the Government 1310 cheating scandal, Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in an emailed statement to The Crimson that “the large volume of work this year necessarily took precedence over this project.”
He added that the Ad Board is “continuing to consider ways in which it can release more detailed statistics,” but did not provide an updated estimate for when the database will be unveiled.
Neal’s statement comes amid heightened scrutiny of top Harvard administrators, who have been accused of acting without transparency in secretly searching the email accounts of resident deans, and then later contradicting an initial statement about the scope of the search.
Since the database project was announced by Secretary of the Ad Board John “Jay” L. Ellison in September 2010, College administrators have worked to compile detailed summaries of past Ad Board cases.
Those case summaries, which will omit all information that could identify involved students, are expected to be viewable online and include academic integrity cases going back three years and 10 years for cases involving peer disputes, such as sexual assault allegations.
For years, the Ad Board has published yearly statistics about its proceedings without information about specific cases. A five-year summary including statistics up to the 2009-2010 academic year are available on the Ad Board’s website, and additional statistics up to the 2011-2012 school year were released to The Crimson last fall.
But the release of the proposed case database would provide an unprecedented level of detail about the Ad Board’s disciplinary process.
Administrators have said that concerns about properly protecting student privacy have slowed the release of the database. A year ago, Ellison told The Crimson that he estimated that the first part of the database, which would deal with academic integrity cases, would be available by the end of the spring 2012 semester.
Neal also told The Crimson last fall that the Ad Board needed to focus on resolving current cases before turning its attention “back to longer-term projects.”
In his statement Monday, Neal wrote that the College has a “continuing obligation” to student privacy as it moves forward with the project.
“The College’s purpose in announcing plans to release more detailed statistics about Administrative Board cases was to provide students with more insight on how certain types of allegations have been resolved in the past,” Neal wrote. “The Board is continuing to consider ways in which it can release more detailed statistics while still protecting the privacy of those involved and will continue this work as other priorities—namely the resolution of its ongoing cases—permit.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
 
For five innings, a pair of freshman pitchers dueled as the Harvard softball team remained in a scoreless deadlock against Boston University. In the sixth inning, the bats struck back.
The Crimson (12-17, 4-4 Ivy) had advanced runners to third base three times in the first five innings of Tuesday’s contest at Soldiers Field, but had nothing to show for it when the team came up to bat in the bottom of the sixth. Instead, Harvard trailed BU (11-20-1, 2-4 America East), 1-0, after the second Terrier to get a hit all day came around to score on an error a few pitches after stealing second in the top half of the inning.
Fortunately for the home squad, its team leader in hits, extra base hits, home runs, and RBIs was up first. Junior third baseman Kasey Lange got the inning started by blasting a shot into the gap in right for a standup double.
Freshman Haley Davis stepped up next and twice failed to lay down a sacrifice bunt. With the count at 3-2, Davis swung away and ripped a double that landed nearly exactly where Lange’s had to drive in the tying run.
“I just relaxed, took a breath, and hit the ball,” Davis said. “I just knew I had to stay calm and trust my hands and just trust that I had good bat control and that she couldn’t beat me.”
Davis advanced to third on a sacrifice bunt and then came home on a throwing error to score what would be the winning run as Harvard went on to beat BU, 2-1.
“We kind of came out and had a few good at-bats in the first run through the lineup…but then we just didn’t adjust,” Crimson coach Jenny Allard said. “Then Kasey and Haley came up big with some good at-bats, and this is something we’ve been working on all year—just getting quality at-bats.”
Three days after giving up a career-high eight runs to Cornell on Saturday, freshman pitcher Morgan Groom bounced back in a big way Tuesday, holding BU scoreless in four innings of one-hit ball before being taken out before the start of the fifth.
“[Groom] felt she needed to rebound after a tough start on Saturday and we gave her the ball,” Allard said. “She really did a great job of getting herself to a good spot and making her pitches work and she threw terrific.”
Early in the game, Terrier freshman hurler Lauren Hynes was similarly effective, limiting Harvard to just three hits in five innings. When the Crimson played small ball to get its base runners into scoring position, Hynes was able to get out of the jam every time before faltering in the sixth, allowing back-to-back doubles to Lange and Davis.
Lange’s team-high seventh double was her only hit of the day, but was enough to extend her hit streak to a season-high four games. Meanwhile, Davis tallied two hits for just the second time in her young career.
After surrendering the first run of the game in the top of sixth, freshman Jamie Halula sealed the game in the seventh despite giving up a lead-off single. Halula retired the next two batters before Kendra Meadows was thrown out trying to steal third. Halula finished the day with one earned run on four hits in three innings of action.
Her one blemish on the scoreboard came in her second frame of duty. After retiring the side in order in the fifth, Halula got the lead-off hitter in the sixth to pop-up but then gave up a single as Jayme Mask beat out the throw for an infield single. Mask then stole second. She came around to score when sophomore Katherine Lantz bobbled a grounder. BU found two more hits, but Halula was able to strand both runners and get out of the inning.
“I thought we did enough to win,” Allard said. “Our pitching kept us in the game. They did a great job.
The midweek non-conference matchup gave the Crimson a chance to improve during a break from Ivy play.
“I thought we were really loose and we had a good kind of focus and a good confidence,” Allard said. “We were relaxed heading into the game—we could have had a little more energy at certain points...but I thought we came out ready to play, and that was good.”
The win was only the Crimson’s second in its last eight contests against the Terriers. Its last win came in 2011 by the same 2-1 margin, when a triple by Lange drove in the winning score. Harvard has now won three of its last four after starting the year 9-16.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s lacrosse team rebounded from two straight nail-biting losses on Tuesday afternoon, riding strong play from its freshmen to earn an 18-8 victory at Quinnipiac.
Harvard (5-6, 1-2 Ivy) fell short last week against No. 2 Cornell and No. 8 Duke by a total margin of three goals, but rebounded forcefully against the Bobcats (4-6, 1-1 NEC).
“In the last few games, we struggled to play consistently for 60 minutes,” Crimson Coach Chris Wojcik said. “But in this one, we really played a complete game and managed to come away with the win.”
Much of Harvard’s production came from players who had not been involved in the offense very much previously, including three freshmen who had career days.
All season, the Crimson has received excellent play from two of its freshman, attackman Devin Dwyer and defenseman Robert Duvnjak.  The duo has have started 11 and nine games, respectively. This was not altogether unexpected going into the season, as Duvnjak was the second ranked prospect in the nation last year and Dwyer was the fourth. Dwyer now leads Harvard with 35 points (15g, 20a), while Duvnjak leads the team with 13 caused turnovers.
In this game, however, other freshmen joined the duo with standout performances. Attackman Ian Ardrey notched the third and fourth goals of his career in addition to his second assist, midfielder Brendan Newman scored the first hat trick of his career, and attackman Deke Burns scored the first four points of his career with a goal and three assists. Dwyer added two goals and four assists, which tied for his highest number of points in any game, bringing the freshman class’ total to eight goals and eight assists in the match.
“It was incredible to see the freshmen step up like they did,” senior captain Jason Gonos said. “Dwyer, Newman, Ardrey and Burns are all great players and we know they have the ability to put up points each game. At this point in the season they have played so much and developed to the point where we don't even think of them as freshman anymore. They are critical parts of this team and they have proved many times that they have deserved their positions on the team.”
The Crimson struggled at the outset. Despite junior attackman Peter Schwartz and Dwyer scoring early, the team went into the second quarter down, 2-3.
“We started off a little slow,” Gonos said. “They came out and played us tough, right from the beginning and we just weren’t playing our game.”
But from that point Harvard dominated, beginning with a three-goal run in the first five minutes of the second period thanks to goals from Newman, senior midfielder Alex White, and junior midfielder Gabriel Mendola. The teams would go into halftime with the Crimson leading, 7-5, following two Quinnipiac goals, and scores by Harvard junior attackman Garrett Campbell and another from Newman.
“After that first quarter we realized that we needed to step it up across the board and get back to playing Harvard lacrosse,” Gonos said. “We started playing fast, pushing the ball in transition, distributing the ball on offensive, and playing strong, smart defense.”
Harvard dominated the third quarter, scoring six goals to the Bobcats’ one. Senior and junior attackmen Jack Walker and Carl Zimmerman each scored once, Dwyer scored his second, Newman secured his hat trick, and Ardrey scored twice to put the Crimson up 13-6.
Only seven seconds into the fourth quarter, senior attackman Henry Mumford scored and Wojcik felt comfortable removing senior goalkeeper Harry Krieger and giving sophomore Jake Gambitsky a shot in the cage for the second time of the season.
“Every single healthy player on the roster played today,” Wojcik said. “It was really great to see some of the players that don’t normally play get their shot.”
Mumford’s goal was followed by one from sophomore midfielder Murphy Vandervelde, who has now scored in the Crimson’s last five games. Burns and Walker then scored again a few minutes later sophomore attackman Phillip Wagley eventually capped the day with a goal of his own, the 18th of the contest.
“It was a great team effort,” Wojcik said. “14 of the 18 goals we scored were assisted, which really shows that we played well together.”
Harvard dominated Quinnipiac in ground balls, scooping up 43 to its opponent’s 32 despite losing the faceoff battle. The Crimson also managed to commit fewer turnovers, coughing up the ball 16 times to the Bobcats’ 19.
“We did really well in terms of possession and hustle,” Wojcik said. “I was really happy with how hard we fought today.”

The internet has a message for you, college students, and it is this: today's hottest social media channels are weapons, and they can and will be used against you (#you). And when they are, writers of well-read blogs will chronicle it and preserve it for posterity. This includes Flyby.
 
This is a public service announcement, then, and it is in brief. If you are going to use the internet, use it wisely. There are many rules, and these are four:
 
1) Practice safe Snapchat.
 
Sure, a sloppy profile picture can make you lose your job. But Snapchat can make you lose your stuff (booze). With a lede we hope has been forever put to rest, The Cavalier Daily reports that a freshman at the University of Virginia (UVA) panicked on Monday when she received a Snapchat from a friend who was apparently at the University Police Station. When she asked her friend for deets, the friend responded that the University's Alcoholic Beverage Control was conducting dorm sweeps and had found beer in her room. She texted a few gal friends, they texted a few guy friends, and through "the power of social media," suddenly all the little freshmen were tossing their Bacardi in the bin and some enterprising fraternity brothers were doing a sweep of their own.
In response to the situation—and in a classic "that freshman" moment—Meredith Markwood, the Snapchatee, told The Cavalier Daily: "I thought, 'I can't have gotten this to the whole first-year class. I am one person. I don't even have 700 Facebook friends.'"
 
Takeaway: Don't Snapchat gullible friends, even if they only have 700 friends on Facebook. 
 
 
2) Only buy used textbooks, because the new ones see you skimming.
Professors at Texas A&M are testing a series of digital textbooks that allow them to know when and how much students read, highlight, and take notes, according to The New York Times. "It's Big Brother, sort of, but with a good intent," an administrator told The Times.
But while the idea of TFs actually knowing (and professors actually having time to know) how much you're reading is no doubt terrifying, it's not a trend to freak out about just yet. Chris Dede, a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, was among the most skeptical academics referenced in the article. He is quoted as saying, "The possibilities of harm are tremendous if teachers are naïve enough to think these scores mean anything for the vast majority of students." If all goes well, we won't be seeing these textbooks here in Cambridge anytime soon.
 
Takeaway: When explaining an educational product to potential skeptics, try not to sell its merits through reference to the dictator of a totalitarian state in a postwar dystopian novel. If, in some dystopian future, you ever have to use one of these textbooks—well, best of luck.
 
3) Hashtag wisely.
 
Or people might think an alive person is dead. Seriously, this happened to Cher this week, although what happened to Margaret Thatcher this week didn't happen to Cher this week.
 
Takeaway: Hashtags aren't funny. Hashtag news is funny.
 
4) Practice peer pressure where necessary.
You are totally within your rights to force friends onto social media (with the exception of Vine). This recently happened to former President Bill Clinton, or should we say "@PrezBillyJeff." Contrary to our previous warning, if this should happen to you, don't worry about it being recorded for posterity. It's only important when it's done by an equally famous #celeb.
 
Takeaway: Why has no one done this for Tina Fey?

With three weeks to go until the primaries, the three Republicans vying for the underdog spot in the upcoming special election for Secretary of State John Kerry's former Senate seat will debate at WBZ-TV studios in Boston starting at 7 p.m. tonight.
Tonight's debate will be the first major confrontation with the Republicans in the spotlight. The last GOP debate, on March 27, was essentially an opening act for the anticipated sparring match between Democrats Stephen F. Lynch and Edward J. Markey.
While several polls show that Markey is heavily favored to defeat Lynch in the April 30 primary, a clear frontrunner in the GOP race has yet to emerge. A poll conducted by WBUR in mid-March revealed that Michael J. Sullivan, a former United States attorney, had a sizable lead over his opponents, State Rep. Daniel B. Winslow and former U.S. Navy SEAL Gabriel E. Gomez. A more recent poll, conducted and released by the Gomez campaign, showed Gomez with a small lead over Sullivan and an advantage over Winslow.
What all the polls have in common so far, though, is that a sizable plurality of respondents have yet to decide. In the WBUR survey, 54 percent of those reached said they were not sure who they would vote for, and in the Gomez poll, 36 percent said they were still unsure.
Tonight's debate will be aired on WBZ and live-streamed on Boston.com, BostonGlobe.com, and cbsboston.com.
