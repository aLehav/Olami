After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over Labor Day weekend, I ran into a friend outside a café on JFK Street. He was in town to visit some other friends and said he hadn’t known I was living in Cambridge, though I had remained here since we were banished from our dorms in March. We agreed to meet up later, and the next day, he picked me up near my apartment. We grabbed takeout from Dumpling House and drove across the river to another friend’s place in Lower Allston. On the way, we cut through Harvard Square. At the intersection of DeWolfe and Mount Auburn, we surveyed the bustle of the late Saturday afternoon — a scene of faces both familiar and not.
“The Harvard shadow campus is pretty bad,” he said. I knew what he meant. What’s the point of “shutting down” campus — or drastically reducing capacity — if all of us were living and socializing right nearby anyway?
Heading into the fall, Americans have talked a lot about the experience and ethical challenges of students moving back on campus (not to mention the obstacles facing those stranded at home), but we’ve been less attentive to students, like myself, who have decided to move back to the college towns they still call home — hanging out at all the classic spots and intermixing with students who have been granted on-campus residency.
Since that drive with my friend, I’ve begun to wonder: Is the “shadow campus” inherently unethical?
Since many of my friends and acquaintances have joined me in Cambridge these past couple weeks, I’ve felt myself drawn to certain irresponsible practices. At my most poetic, I’ve imagined myself like the protagonist of “Death in Venice.” Aschenbach, a notable and notably proper writer, takes a vacation in Venice, where he becomes unexpectedly infatuated with a young boy named Tadzio. Slipping into the delirium of obsession, forgetting his defining reasonableness, he ignores the signs, warnings, and then arrival of a great plague that kills him. If I’m Aschenbach, Tadzio is all these classmates back in town on the banks of the Charles (basically the Lido of Massachusetts). I’m caught between compulsion and reason, yearning and terror. And all the while, I worry that before I’ve realized it or chosen to accept it, coronavirus will have overtaken Cambridge again.
For most students who have moved back to Cambridge, there doesn’t seem to be much of a practical reason beyond a sort of obviousness. There certainly isn’t a good financial one. Cambridge is no cheaper than anywhere else — ranked the fifth most expensive college town in the U.S. — and though landlords have been more flexible than usual, the pandemic hasn’t done much to change that. Moreover, with students hailing from all over the country, it’s probably not the most geographically convenient either.
But it is where students have met, formed bonds, and rooted their shared identity. We are, in a meaningful sense, Cantabrigians. Many of us have registered to vote here, held jobs and paid taxes here, and provided community service here. We’ve developed a deep sense of belonging in this city, immersing ourselves in local issues, businesses, and ways of life.
And I wonder if to some extent students moving back will have a profoundly positive impact on the University and its relationship to the city — breaking down town-gown divisions, deepening their investment in the community beyond Harvard Square, and perhaps making homes here that will last beyond graduation.
So while my friend is right that our presence may exacerbate the pandemic both on Harvard’s campus and in the city more broadly (though the data has yet to point to that being the case with both antigen and PCR tests in Cambridge below one percent in mid-September), his thinking echoes a generalization about college students that has come to deeply trouble me.
In recent weeks, many have criticized universities and colleges that have invited undergraduates back to campus and then dismissed them for violations of social distancing. New York University and Northeastern are just two. They argue that those institutions have knowingly held young people to standards that they cannot reasonably be expected to keep. It’s now clear that institutions that have completely opened their gates have woefully miscalculated — both their own public health measures and the pertinence of the virus, but, critically not, the moral capacity of undergraduates.
Afterall, it’s young people who have led some of the largest scale protests in American history without exacerbating rates of COVID-19 by taking common sense public health measures.
The truth is students living off-campus have all the capacity they need to make smart social distancing choices. And they can do so while supporting the local economies that have suffered (and would continue to suffer) in their absence, volunteering in public health and other community service areas, and making important political and social change through responsible activism. The Harvard shadow campus, no doubt, bears a risk, but it need not be a deadly one.
Recently, I got together with a friend living on campus for a snack and drink. We met at a middle point between the two of us and Union Square — a place we hoped to get a better feel for. Before coronavirus, I had never been to Somerville; I hardly knew what it was, let alone where. We wore our masks until we sat, enjoyed some food and a glass of wine, paid and tipped, and then strolled back toward Cambridge.
That need not be an exception. In fact, if I had my way, that’s how Friday night in college would look even without a shadow campus.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What happens during a Zoom glitch? We’ve all experienced one. Maybe the video freezes and memorializes a hilarious gesture. Maybe the pitch drops and the audio slows to a comic crawl. When it ends, maybe we apologize for the terrible Wi-Fi. The glitch reminds us that technological shortcomings smother our social interactions. I’ve found few situations more frustrating, especially when I want nothing more than to be with people I cannot see without Zoom or the platform in question.
That assumption — that without Zoom, FaceTime, or Skribbl, I cannot be with others — is one I reinforce daily as the pandemic rages on. In a quiet, empty house while my family members work, I frequently brood over whether it’s worth expending the energy it takes to call or text someone for some liveliness and movement, or whether I should just bunker down and write my thesis. The fact that those are the only options often alarms me, because I’m actively buying into the illusion that other people are absent without my motivation to initiate the interaction and the technological media I have (or don’t) to access them.
Yet, the advice on isolation in quarantine has been overwhelmingly to take advantage of the many opportunities available to talk to people. That rhetorical phrase, “to take advantage of,” dominates the way college administrators gush about the abundant promise within technology. In such an instrumental view, it’s the technology that frames every potential human interaction, as opposed to the other way around.
Martin Buber, an existentialist philosopher who wrote about Jewish thought, presented a framework for sincere relationships with others in his 1923 book, “I and Thou,” that critiques the assumption that I and so many others make as we use Zoom and other virtual realities. For Buber, relationality is the fundamental truth of existence. He offers two “word pairs” as paradigms for how we participate in the world. One pair is “I-It.” The other is “I-You.” In Buber’s picture, the “I” is a subjectivity, an envelope of identity and experience, the first person. The “I” can encounter others in two ways. When the paradigm is “I-It,” encounters are objectifying, and the “I” perceives the other as limited to what one can observe or understand. In contrast, the “I-You” pair neither measures nor manipulates, but instead rises above words and facts and makes two people fully present to one another.
What does that even mean? It’s tremendously abstract, and in a way thinking or writing about the “I-You” encounter is impossible and even counterproductive, since it is by nature without language and definition. But Buber’s criteria are useful in the context of pandemic socializing. In the “I-It” paradigm, one simply experiences the other. The “I-It” encounter is a passive checklist, a calendar appointment, glazed-over eyes, a dutiful response to a professor. In the “I-It” paradigm, we frame staying in touch as holding on to, or keeping tabs on, other people. Where they are, what they’re doing. Whether they’re healthy. We frame connection as reliant on various conduits with concrete boundaries. As soon as the meeting ends—or when there’s a glitch—an “I-It” connection feels lost, or somehow diminished. On the other hand, in the “I-You” framework, one participates in the other. In the “I-You” the medium of connection falls away and becomes irrelevant.
It’s natural, I think, to drift toward the language of advantage or objectification, especially when we have so little else to rely on. But Buber’s framework renders the physical space between us surmountable and, in fact, important. It’s where we refuse, in quarantine, to allow our worlds to shrink to the handful of humans (if any) we interact with on a regular basis. Maybe it is something like conceiving of our realities with others in mind, going about our days knowing that there have been, and still are, others with a stake in how we act today. How we read or write. How we address problems. How we extend a hand. Whether we speak up or are silent. Buber would go as far as to say that noticing a friend’s new haircut is an observation-happy “I-It” relation, and I’m not sure whether such a total eschewing of sensation and emotional experience is possible, at least for me. But I do like the idea of cultivating continuous sensibilities, and not discrete expectations, for my participation in other people.
Perhaps the next time there is a Zoom glitch, or a scheduling conflict, or even a loud silence in the house, I can peel away my tendency to objectify, grasp, or seek attention, and know that people far away from me are very much still present—not because I can or cannot see or hear them, but because they simply are.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Researchers at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences found inspiration in the architecture of deep-sea marine sponges’ skeletal systems when seeking to build sturdier load-bearing structures with higher material efficiency.
The findings — which were published in Nature Materials on Monday — revealed that the lattice-like structures found in sponges increase overall structural strength by more than 20 percent compared to other lattice geometries composed of the same amount of material.
Matheus C. Fernandes, a graduate student and first author on the paper, wrote in an email that the motivation behind the research was to look to Euplectella aspergillum, a sponge commonly known as the Venus’ flower basket, as a model for designing taller skyscrapers or longer bridges.
“Nature has been solving engineering problems for much longer than we have, so they must be doing something right,” Fernandes wrote. “Many marine sponges build robust and highly regular skeletal systems out of intrinsically brittle materials like glass, so they seemed like great model systems to study for design inspiration.”
Materials Science and Chemistry and Chemical Biology professor Joanna Aizenberg, who has studied sea sponges for about 20 years, wrote in an email that the “unique hierarchical architecture” of the sponges can teach humans “how to design strong, robust structures.”
Fernandes said a fundamental challenge in building architectural structures lies in achieving a high strength-to-weight ratio, since heavier structures can be sensitive to buckling under their own weight.
“For skyscrapers, the taller you build, the heavier they become,” Fernandes wrote. “So if you have redundant material adding up through its height, the bottom of the building eventually becomes limited on how much weight it can support, putting a cap on how tall you can build.”
Fernandes added that modern infrastructure typically uses a lattice resembling “a grid covered with crosses.” When the researchers analyzed Euplectella aspergillum, they discovered that the sponge utilized “a double set of diagonals going through every other cell of a square lattice, creating a design that alternates with crosses and octagonal openings, resembling a checkerboard-like pattern.”
“Because of its nonintuitive design, this specific geometry had not been previously considered by structural engineers, highlighting the benefits of this highly interdisciplinary research which combines biology, civil engineering, and mathematical modeling,” Fernandes wrote. “The cool thing about what we’ve learned from this study is that the sponge’s engineering secret is not related to its construction material or chemistry, but rather, it’s simply the geometry.”

Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana defended the principle behind Harvard’s sanctions targeting single gender social organizations in a Friday interview — his first since the University dropped the policy this summer.
The sanctions barred members of single-gender social organizations from receiving College endorsement for fellowships or holding sports captaincies and leadership positions in extracurricular groups. The policy spawned twin state and federal lawsuits by a group of fraternities, sororities, and anonymous students.
Those legal challenges ultimately proved fatal to the social group policy Khurana championed. University President Lawrence S. Bacow wrote in June that administrators believed federal courts would bar Harvard from enforcing the sanctions after a Supreme Court decision affirmed precedents central to the plaintiff’s case.
Though Khurana said he understood why dropping the sanctions was necessary, he also said the College remains committed to the ideas that underlay them.
“The policy was motivated by a strong belief that — whatever backgrounds and identities students have — they should have access to all the opportunities the College has to offer,” he said. “Discrimination based on how one identifies with respect to gender should not be part of the Harvard story in this 21st century.”
He added that the nation’s current reckoning with racial injustice should open up a moment for students to critically examine the ways in which they themselves — or the institutions to which they belong — perpetuate inequality.
“If anything, what this summer has shown is that this is a moment for all of our institutions to think about our practices that we’ve often taken for granted and naturalized, and to think about how they either help us move toward a more inclusive society and equitable society, or to think about how they perpetuate inequalities both within our campus and beyond,” he said.
Khurana first proposed the sanctions — the highest-profile undertaking of his tenure as dean — in April 2016, at a closed-door meeting with final club leadership. A month later, former University President Drew G. Faust approved a public proposal to regulate unrecognized single gender organizations, which Khurana said he devised in response to the recommendations of a University-wide report on sexual assault prevention.
In December 2017, the Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, voted to support the sanctions. The unusual intervention in undergraduate life was meant to ensure the decision extended beyond Faust’s presidency after she stepped down in June 2018.
Since they were implemented four years ago, the sanctions compelled nearly all of Harvard’s all-female social organizations to admit men, while largely failing to alter the membership rules of male-only groups. The co-ed Delphic-Bee Club, for one, announced it would split into the all-male Delphic Club and the all-female Bee Club three years after merging last month, according to club affiliates. The split came one month after Harvard rolled back its policy.
Khurana said he trusts students to hold themselves to high standards of inclusion.
“I have such faith in our students to continually advocate for inclusion, to understand how important it is to dismantle those structures of inequality that have left so many in pain, and to help be the type of people who are going to restore the social fabric,” he said.
Still, interest in single-gender groups appears to be rising after the sanctions’s demise. Nearly 40 percent of students in the Class of 2024 indicated in a Crimson survey that they strongly or somewhat favored the College’s decision to drop the sanctions. Meanwhile, 11 percent of the class indicated that they were “very interested” in joining a final club — up from 4.7 percent last year.

Researchers at Harvard’s Wyss Institute have developed a new malaria diagnostic test that efficiently detects and can distinguish between species of malaria parasites, according to a study published Monday.
Rose A. Lee, a visiting fellow at the Wyss Institute and co-author of the study, said the new procedure significantly improves upon current diagnostic methods, which fail to differentiate between types of malaria.
“The standard of care is there are antigen tests that are used,” Lee said. “They detect a protein really fast, within usually 15 minutes to an hour. You can detect malaria using the antigen-based tests, but most of those tests are only designed to detect falciparum — which is the most common and deadly type of malaria — or not.”
The test incorporates the so-called “SHERLOCK” protocol — short for specific high-sensitivity enzymatic reporter unlocking — which has been separately identified as a possible way to develop cheap and accessible COVID-19 tests. The Wyss researchers used the protocol, which uses the Cas13 enzyme to detect specific RNA sequences within various types of raw samples, to find and distinguish different malaria-carrying parasites species in the Plasmodium genus, though they tailored their approach to use Cas12a to detect DNA directly instead of RNA.
Lee added that procedures that only identify Plasmodium falciparum can lead to severe consequences for patients, since other types of malaria are resilient to therapies designed to treat Plasmodium falciparum because they enter a dormant stage in the human liver. Lee said this can cause “relapses” of malaria within such patients.
Lee said she expects the new test to serve as an inexpensive alternative to antigen tests. A press release accompanying the study noted that the test has shown promising results by analyzing samples containing two species of malaria with 100 percent sensitivity and specificity.
The team had been working with collaborators in Kenya before the coronavirus pandemic put a stop to most international travel. Lee said the team will be seeking field validation of the test while making improvements to the procedure in the future.
“Pilot field validation work still needs to be done, which we’re interested in pursuing, as well as, certainly, we could add on more infectious disease targets,” Lee said. “You can imagine panels of testing for detecting various different types of diseases — for example, distinguishing Ebola and malaria.”

During the start of the coronavirus pandemic, Harvard Kennedy School students advocated for need-based financial aid and more financial support from the administration. Months later, they say the administration’s response remains insufficient.
In May, the Kennedy School Student Government sent a proposal outlining the necessity of need-based grants for full-time degree programs to HKS Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf.
The proposal stated that the school should “incorporate applicants’ financial need assessment at an earlier state” in its admissions process to ensure socioeconomic diversity within the school. It also recommended that the school fund need-based scholarships with class gift funds, factor in need when distributing merit-based scholarships, create a need-specific fundraising system, and form a need-based scholarship program.
Currently, the school awards merit-based fellowships and scholarships after an assessment from the admissions committee, according to the school’s website.
HKS student Diego A. Garcia Blum said many students are facing financial hardships as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, which has devastated the U.S. economy and led to record-breaking unemployment numbers.
“There were a lot of people who felt that the full tuition costs were not justified for the online-only education,” he said. “On top of that, there were people who lost scholarships because of COVID. Literally foundations and organizations that said, ‘we’re giving you this money based on revenue estimates that we have for the rest of the year — which dried off.’”
“The students who had their education planned out based on these scholarships got hit by COVID, but the school didn’t share the burden of that with them at all,” he added. “So we found that the way that the school handled the situations to be inequitable, because those students were not taken into account.”
Kennedy School spokesperson James F. Smith wrote in an email that the school has “expanded” its current financial aid appeals process to “help students meet the additional financial needs prompted by COVID-19.”
“During the Spring 2020 semester, we also instituted an emergency hardship fund, and we expect to be able to offer similar hardship support this fall,” he wrote.
HKS alumni have raised funds to support current students during the pandemic. In a fundraising email to alumni in Washington, D.C., Kennedy School alumni council members wrote, “Please help us ‘pay it forward,’ and send the message that we care about our future alumni and are ready to step up.”
However, current students and alumni still stressed the importance of establishing a need-based financial aid system to allow for more students to attend the school — an issue that students have lobbied for years prior to the pandemic.
The student government’s proposal cited a 2019 survey of roughly 50 applicants of color who declined admissions to HKS. This survey, which HKS students organized, showed that 74 percent of domestic applicants of color who declined their admissions offers did so due to financial burdens.
Sophie P. Dover, a recent graduate of HKS and one of the survey's organizers, said they presented these findings to HKS Senior Associate Dean for Degree Programs and Student Affairs Debbie Isaacson.
“What we said was, even though this was a small group of students, we think you should continue to look into these trends,” she said.
HKS students have long attributed the lack of racial diversity among Kennedy School students to the school’s inadequate financial aid program.
“When we’re talking about how structural racism plays out, a big way it plays out is financially, and there are huge obstacles for students of color to being able to finance their own education, so I think this could be a really meaningful step for the Kennedy School,” Dover said.
Smith wrote that the current financial aid already “factors in an individual’s level of need,” and the school is looking for “ways to expand need-based financial support.”
“While we would love to be able to meet the needs of all of our students, converting to an entirely need-based system would require far greater funding than we now have,” he said.
In their May proposal to administrators, students also requested that Kennedy School administrators “release data on the dimensions of socioeconomic diversity that are currently collected by the Office of Financial Services.”
Charlene A. Wang, the former president of the student government who authored the original proposal, said that reforming financial aid was one of the issues she focused on in her campaign and that students needed data to understand the scope of their financial need.
“We had very popular backing around that, so we felt confident that this is something that a lot of students want to see, because they all can see that there is some kind of injustice happening here when students who are coming from the neediest backgrounds aren’t able to have access to a public policy school — to allow them to change the very circumstances that they have lived,” Wang said.
“We can kind of sense from this that financial aid needs reform,” she added. “But we can never get our hands on data or be able to do a data analysis of how many students from this kind of low income disadvantaged background are at the school.”
HKS student Leah Nakaima said the previous student government had been in talks with alumni about creating a method for them to donate directly to an established need-based aid fund.
Wang, who graduated from HKS last spring, said change at the school is often “driven” by students.
“It just feels like sometimes like this is just not a priority for the administration, unless it’s driven by students and alumni to continue to push them on this,” Wang said. “If you want to push the administration to make change, you kind of have to hold them and lead the way.”
As the Kennedy School elects a new student government, Garcia Blum said he hopes financial aid reform will be a priority for the next set of leaders. Still, he said many student organizations at the school would advocate for reform for its students.
“This is very important for a lot of students like me who worked on it in the last year,” he said. “If the new student body president, or people who get elected, are not championing it, there are other organizations who are willing to champion it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Business School, following a history of diversity issues in its curriculum and in its classrooms, launched an “Action Plan for Racial Equity” on Wednesday.
Harvard Business School Dean Nitin Nohria announced the initiative in a letter to school affiliates. Nohria cited recent national demonstrations against systemic racism as a motivation for the “action plan.”
“This moment has made urgently clear that the School must redouble its commitment to combat racism—and anti-Black racism in particular—to create meaningful and enduring change that will enable every member of our community to thrive,” Nohria wrote. “Our Action Plan for Racial Equity reflects our highest aspirations for the School and the role it can play in business and society.”
Students and alumni have criticized the Business School for its lack of racial diversity and representation in curriculum in recent years. As of Fall 2018, only 5 percent of students were Black — a number that had remained stagnant since 2008. In addition, only four percent of the cases read by Business School first-years feature a Black protagonist.
In June, Steven Rogers — an alumnus of the Business School and a senior lecturer from 2012 to 2019 — accused the school of “systemic anti-Black practices” that bar faculty and students from advancing in their positions.
The plan released Wednesday was developed by a 25-member task force, spearheaded by Ronald S. Chandler, the School’s Chief Information Officer, HBS professor Janice H. Hammond, and HBS professor Jan W. Rivkin.
The group began meeting in early July and established a plan targeting seven areas for racial equity, establishing working groups for each area. Each group was asked to plan two or three initiatives related to their area. The working group’s efforts ultimately culminated in the seven-step plan.
The first step is an “unambiguous rejection of racism, and anti-Black racism in particular,” and a “vision” of the Business School as an anti-racist institution. The Business School also plans to hire a Chief Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Officer to act as a senior administrator.
Two initiatives will focus on longstanding challenges at the school: recruiting Black students and faculty to Business School programs, and developing more racially representative curriculum material.
One initiative will focus on preparing students to act as “leaders for racial equity.” In addition, one will center on partnering with businesses in efforts for racial equity to improve commercial practices and create a more diverse workplace.
Every initiative has been assigned to a senior staff member, responsible for coordinating work and defining a timeline for implementation.
Nohria has committed $25 million to the plan over the next ten years. Over time, HBS plans to solicit donations for the initiative.

Are you a brain-on-camera-on person or a napping-during-class-camera-off person? Turns out it doesn't matter when keeping your camera on in class is a requirement... Is this new measure of class attendance something to love or something to hate?
Love it — Nicole T. Rozelman 
Be honest with yourself: as you locked eyes with your reflection in the black screen between your 19th and 20th Netflix episodes, you had a bit of a wake-up call. Your contorted slouch against your headboard couldn’t be good for you and missing campus just isn’t a good enough excuse to be wearing your Pfohome t-shirt every day. What better incentive to get your life back on track than the promise of a Zoom private message-tionship with your new section crush?
As the air starts to take on that autumn crisp, we all know the rush of nervous excitement that we kick ourselves for having as soon as the first 100 page reading gets assigned. But like it or not, school is fun. It’s the only time in our lives when we get to soak up as much information as possible from world-class professors and engage with incredibly smart and passionate peers, both of which are much harder to do with our cameras off. It’s far too tempting to scroll through Insta or honestly just take a nap during class, so camera-on policies are the extra push we need to help us make the most out of the classes we’re paying tens of thousands of dollars to be in. While Zoom can’t replicate the experience of being in a classroom, watching everyone’s reactions to class discussions and chat pms gone wrong helps make us all feel like we’re part of a community.
Plus, in this age of online classes, the students have the upper hand. By April, most of us had figured out the perfect lighting-angle-background-wfh setup for every situation. Trying to look cute in a 250 person lecture? Cameras required plays right into your “I just happened to be wearing a full face of makeup” vibe. (Pro tip: accidentally unmute yourself to make sure you’re pinned to the first grid of everyone’s screens.) Didn’t do the reading and trying to disappear? We recommend sitting in front of a sunny window and tilting your camera up for a nice half-face, half-ceiling shot. If the glare of the light isn’t enough to make your professor look away, the Zoom name label will blur your guilty face as you do work for another class.
We’re all just faking it ‘til we make it here at Zoom U, so maybe a little forced interaction with other humans and *this is fine* energy is exactly what we need to get us as close as possible to a semblance of a college experience.
Hate it — Christine Mui
No words make my ears want to curl up into my head and never come back out more than when a professor says “everyone must turn their cameras on” at the beginning of a Zoom meeting. Okay, they typically don’t word it like that. More frequently, this demand is phrased as a vague, “chill” up-to-you type of deal, along the lines of “Hey, I’d really appreciate it if everybody who’s able to can turn their cameras on.” Sure, there might be some professors who genuinely mean this, but they’ve been ruined by the handful of professors that pause class five minutes later to point out the proportion of students still with their cameras off before spending the next who knows how long contemplating out loud whether these students all have valid reasons for doing so. But at the end of the day, why do they get to determine whether my reason for wanting to turn the camera off is valid?
I’m not saying I don’t understand the reasons professors require cameras to be on. “It’s to recreate the environment of class like it would’ve been on campus.” I mean if we were in Science Center C, let’s be honest you would never dwell on my face long enough to memorize it, let alone notice if I had sunglasses on or a bag over my head, essentially the real-life equivalent of cameras-off. And though keeping cameras on does make it less likely students will go on their phone to watch TikToks, it’s certainly no guarantee. Seeing somebody’s face is only one, fairly limited component of academic engagement. Yet, I’ve noticed that professors have been stopping there when they should be focusing on how to better the presentation of material, not the presentation of students themselves.
There are less practical reasons too. Maybe, last night, at 3 in the morning, I dyed my hair pink and cut half bangs before chickening out (true story), so I’m saving the class from seeing this. Or take CS50 for example. Those same recorded class lectures are reused for the edX version of the course. I’m not trying to make my Internet debut to hundreds of try-hard highschoolers, that’s what TikTok is for. Zoom fatigue is real. For those of us who don’t have blue-light glasses, please just let me take the occasional day to focus solely on the audio.
