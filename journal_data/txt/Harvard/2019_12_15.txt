After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Standing in the pouring rain, United States Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III (D-Mass.) joined roughly 20 picketers to obstruct loading docks behind Harvard's Science Center Saturday morning, marking the 12th day of an indefinite strike by the University's graduate student union.
After roughly 13 months of negotiating with University administrators in pursuit of their first contract, members of Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers began their strike on Dec. 3. More than 90 percent of union voters authorized the strike in late October.
As part of their efforts, graduate union picketers and their supporters have disrupted mail and package deliveries across campus for the past two weeks. Previously, United Parcel Service stopped delivering to Harvard in support of the strike.
Kennedy spoke with members of the bargaining committee about the status of negotiations and their proposals early Saturday morning. Afterwards, he joined the picket line in the rain and gave a short speech to gathered members of the graduate student union.
“What I think this breaks down to is a philosophical difference between what we believe is work,” Kennedy told the picketers. “What the University is saying, it’s trying to classify you all as students, and not recognizing the contributions you make to the University.”
In an interview with The Crimson after he finished picketing, Kennedy spoke about the lessons he learned while he was a student at Harvard Law School.
“When I was a student here — in the Law school — one of the things that stuck with me about the classes that I took and what our professors taught was, our society was founded upon the idea that everybody should be able to meet their own basic needs, and when that system of power transfers too far to one side, that you’ve got to fight back and take it,” he said.
Kennedy also said he recognizes the value of graduate students’ work at Harvard.
“They’re educating the next generation of leaders, of business, of civil society, of law, teachers, educators, doctors, and off of an educational model that depends on the work that graduate students are going to provide,” he said. “To not recognize that contribution in the midst of an overall massive inequity of economic power and bargaining power — I would hope that if there’s one institution that would take the lead on recognizing that, it would be this one.”
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on Kennedy’s remarks, referring back to a Nov. 26 emailed update on negotiations sent by University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76.
“The University appreciates the vital role that our student workers play in fulfilling Harvard’s teaching and research mission,” Garber wrote at the time.
Kennedy — who is currently running to represent Massachusetts in the U.S. Senate — is one of numerous politicians to walk the picket lines over the last two weeks. One of his opponents in the Democratic Senate primary, labor attorney Shannon E. Liss-Riordan ’90, picketed last week. U.S. Representatives Katherine Clark (D-Mass.) and Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) attended a rally on Monday alongside Cambridge City Councilors Sumbul Siddiqui and Alanna M. Mallon and Cambridge Mayor Marc C. McGovern.
“We have seen this over and over and over again, but you're also seeing the first time — certainly since I’ve been around politics — we’re actually winning,” Kennedy told the picketers at the end of his remarks. “It’s because of what you guys are doing. I'm so grateful. Thanks for letting me stop by and good luck.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard College’s Admissions Office is “moving ahead” with the suggestions that Judge Allison D. Burroughs included in her ruling on Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard, according to Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67.
In 2014, SFFA sued the University, alleging that the College unlawfully discriminates against Asian American applicants in its admissions process. Burroughs presided over a three-week trial starting in Oct. 2018, and ruled in favor of Harvard on all five counts in Oct. 2019.
After lauding the importance of diversity in higher education and finding that the College is not guilty of any unlawful discrimination, Burroughs offered a number of suggestions to the Admissions Office.
“Notwithstanding the fact that Harvard’s admissions program survives strict scrutiny, it is not perfect,” she wrote in the ruling. “The process would likely benefit from conducting implicit bias trainings for admissions officers, maintaining clear guidelines on the use of race in the admissions process, which were developed during this litigation, and monitoring and making admissions officers aware of any significant race-related statistical disparities in the rating process.”
“We thought they were very good suggestions,” Fitzsimmons said in a Wednesday interview, noting that his office has already completed some implicit bias trainings.
Fitzsimmons also said he hopes to invite Psychology professor Mahzarin R. Banaji — one of several scholars who first coined the term “implicit bias” — to speak with admissions staff.
“Lots of people on our committee are very familiar with her work, and with the concept of implicit bias,” he said. “But I think it's good to make it — in a funny way — even more explicit, as it were, by making sure that everybody is as familiar with implicit bias as I have been.”
The Admissions Office has also taken steps to create clearer guidelines on their use of race, according to Fitzsimmons. The “reading procedures” for applicants to the Class of 2023 explicitly prohibited admissions officers from considering an applicant’s race when assigning scores for personal traits.
Fitzsimmons said he will again re-evaluate the guidelines before he begins the training program for new staff over the summer. He added that much of the training process is discussion-based and falls outside the purview of written instructions and training materials.
Fitzsimmons also said he thinks the Admissions Office will likely more explicitly lay out training procedures in writing.
“There is an enormous amount of training, about how all these factors — how does first gen come in? How does, for example, being a local Cambridge or Boston student come in? All of that is part of the training, but not all of it is written down explicitly, but I think now we will write it down more explicitly,” he said.
Burroughs also suggested that the Admissions Office both track and make admissions officers “aware of any significant race-related statistical disparities in the rating process.”
Fitzsimmons said he is working with several of Harvard’s lawyers — including head trial counsel and senior fellow of the Harvard Corporation William F. Lee ’72 and Office of the General Counsel attorney Ara B. Gershengorn ’93 — to put this recommendation into practice.
A few days after Burroughs ruled in favor of Harvard, SFFA appealed the decision to the First Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston. Attorneys for both sides are currently awaiting the release of a briefing schedule to set the timeline for the next phase of the trial.
At the conclusion of her decision, Burroughs wrote that “the Court will not dismantle a very fine admissions program that passes constitutional muster, solely because it could do better.”
Fitzsimmons said he took note of that comment, too.
“She called it ‘a very fine admissions process,’ but it's like anything else,” he said. “You can always be better. You can always be more explicit, in a funny way. So that's what we're working on.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A group of more than 200 senior scholars from across the United States is dissatisfied with University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s response to their letter decrying associate Romance Languages and Literatures professor Lorgia García Peña’s tenure denial, according to a statement the group released Thursday.
The scholars — who specialize in fields including ethnic studies, Latin American studies, and African American studies — first wrote to Bacow on Monday. A day later, he responded reiterating the confidential nature of Harvard’s tenure review processes, according to an email obtained by The Crimson.
“At Harvard, every tenure case is reviewed with great care by multiple bodies within the University,” Bacow wrote in the email. “To ensure the integrity of the process, all aspects of tenure deliberations—both documents and discussions—must be treated with the utmost confidentiality.”
Bacow added that, while the members of the Faculty and Arts and Sciences’ leadership have been in “direct communication” with García Peña, the University cannot disclose details about her or others’ tenure cases to third parties.
“To share highly confidential information with individuals not directly involved in advising us about the tenure decision would violate the trust that members of the academic community—at Harvard and elsewhere—place in the integrity of our process,” he wrote.
The University denied García Peña tenure Nov. 27. The scholars’ demands for a reassessment of her case come after weeks of campus organizing by the Harvard Ethnic Studies Coalition. That group has called on Harvard to publicly release Bacow’s letter to FAS Dean Claudine Gay about García Peña’s tenure decision and investigate her case for “procedural errors” and discrimination.
Students have also linked García Peña’s case to the almost half-century long fight for a formalized ethnic studies program at Harvard. Over the past several weeks, the Ethnic Studies Coalition has sent its own letters to top administrators; hosted rallies; occupied various campus buildings, including University Hall, the Office of the Provost, and the Admissions Office; and interrupted a faculty meeting.
In their statement, the scholars wrote that Bacow’s response to their letter was the exact same message he sent to the students who wrote in protest. They condemned him for the “one-paragraph” response, claiming it did not address their demand that the University reevaluate García Peña’s “superior” scholarly production and review her tenure decision.
“Nowhere in the scholars’ letter was there a demand for release of the internal documents related to the tenure case or commentary on the reasons for denial,” they wrote.
“Bacow’s unwillingness to take seriously the scholars’ points or to demonstrate that he had understood the letter speaks to Harvard’s refusal to show that Latinx studies matter at the university,” they added.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on the scholars’ statement, pointing to Bacow’s interview with The Crimson last week. During the interview, Bacow declined to comment on García Peña’s specific case but noted that he has never reversed a tenure decision during his time at the helm of Harvard and Tufts, where he was president from 2001 to 2011.“I've never reversed a tenure decision,” Bacow said. “I have not seen one reversed during my time as president of Tufts. I don't recall one ever being reversed during my time as Chancellor of MIT.”
