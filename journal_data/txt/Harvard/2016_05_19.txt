Korean director Chan-wook Park's “Mademoiselle (The Handmaiden)” impresses with its eye-catching cinematography, daring sex scenes, and plentiful plot twists. However, it fails in its most fundamental aspect: It possesses no genuine emotion or believable story. Beneath its beautiful veneer, the film is hollow. The characters are not portrayed as real human beings but rather act simply a means of introducing the aforementioned sex scenes and plot twists, lending “The Handmaiden” an air more reminiscent of a role-playing video game than a real film.
Adapted from the novel “Fingersmith,” the film transports the story’s setting from Victorian England to Korea under Japanese occupation in the 1930s. Sook-hee (Tae-ri Kim), an orphan raised by a swindler (Jung-woo Ha), is sent to be the maid of a Japanese heiress (Min-hee Kim) soon to inherit her parents’ assets. At the same time, the swindler himself attempts, using the false identity of Count Fujiwara, to approach the heiress and, with the help of Sook-hee, win her heart to get her money. As the film develops, the swindler’s conspiracy is revealed to be more complex than it first seems, and the relationship between the protagonists changes every minute.
Indeed, the second half of the film consists almost solely of plot twists. Everyone has secrets; everyone has an agenda; and everyone has been secretly aware of each other’s respective secrets and agendas. While at first these developments may seem engaging, they soon prove excessive. Park is so obsessed with designing and explaining conspiracies that he ceases caring whether the characters have any reason to carry them out. Any person can conveniently hate or love another with no foreshadowing at all. The result is that the intricate plans fail to capture interest because the people who benefit or suffer are no longer relatable.
Similarly, the abundant sex scenes in the film not only are unnecessary but also are not supported by the characters’ motivations. They carry a voyeuristic tinge and exploit the female body in the name of revealing humanity’s inner darkness. Despite focusing on female characters, “The Handmaiden” takes no interest in the heiress’s or the titular handmaiden’s emotions and identities, instead putting them on lewd display. The irony underlying these actions is alarming.
“The Handmaiden” does have many strengths, such as its lovely cinematography, gorgeous set designs, and exciting pacing. But all these merits are undermined by the disconnect between the director and the characters, as the former treats the latter as chessmen. No matter how pretty “The Handmaiden” may look, she is vacant inside.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This semester, Divest Harvard and Democracy Matters teamed
up to investigate Harvard’s fossil fuel investments. The Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change estimates that around $100 billion dollars need to
be divested from fossil fuel extraction each year for the next twenty years to
meet climate goals. Yet Harvard refuses to draw down its fossil fuel
investments and is even making new private equity investments in oil and gas
exploration and extraction. This led us to wonder: Exactly what is Harvard
investing in?
To investigate, we looked into Harvard’s Security and
Exchange Commission filings,
which are available to the public. Although these reveal only about 3%  of
Harvard investments, they provide a window into the fossil fuel companies
Harvard invests in.
One area we focused on was fracking (short for “hydraulic
fracturing”), a process in which high-pressure (and toxic)
fluids are pumped underground to break apart rocks holding oil and gas. Recent peer-reviewed research has indicated that the process
can contaminate groundwater used for drinking with toxic chemicals and can release
large amounts of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, into the
atmosphere.
So what do Harvard’s fracking investments look like? 
Since 2014, Harvard has invested in at least nineteen companies
in the fracking sector, including production companies (Anadarko, Athlon Energy,
Atlas Energy, Atlas Resource Partners, Concho Resources, EOG Resources, Hess
Corp., Marathon Oil, Pioneer Natural Resources, Range Resources, Viper Energy
Partners, and WPX Energy), equipment and operations companies (Baker Hughes,
Cameron International Corp., and Dresser-Rand), and pipeline and
export companies (Cheniere Energy, Energy Transfer Partners, Kinder Morgan, and
Williams Companies, Inc.) Harvard’s disclosed investments in fracking peaked
in 2014, when it reported that $346 million—or 30% of all reported investments—were
devoted to these companies. For comparison, that’s about seventeen times the
size of Harvard’s entire $20 million Climate Change Solutions Fund.
Many of these companies have less-than-responsible track
records. Take Range Resources, in which Harvard invested about $2 million in
2014 and 2015. The company has been found responsible for over
200 legal violations in Pennsylvania alone. An investigation by the New York Times in 2011
found widespread evidence of poisoning of local residents by the company’s
fracking chemicals. The company has a history of strong-arming communities in order to push for
favorable drilling policies, and in litigation, the company has imposed
lifelong gag
orders on affected individuals, including on children, barring
them from speaking about the fracking industry for the rest of their lives.
The company also makes a concerted effort to buy favor from
politicians. It has its own Political Action Committee, the Range Resources Energy PAC, which gives money to
politicians in Pennsylvania, where it operates. This mirrors a larger trend from the oil and gas industry of using
political donations to influence policy.
Range Resources is not alone in its history of legal
violations. A 2015 report
by the Natural Resources Defense Council lists three other companies Harvard
has invested in—Anadarko, Pioneer, and WPX—as top violators.
Harvard reports only about 3% of its investments to the SEC.
If the rest of the endowment is weighted even remotely similarly to the portion made publicly
available, then Harvard may have invested billions of dollars in fracking in
the past two years (which would be hundreds of times greater than the size of Harvard’s
Climate Change Solutions Fund). And this does not include Harvard’s other
fossil fuel investments, like coal, non-fracked oil and gas, pipelines, and oilfield services.
For climate, as anything else, education is important. We
know about the climate-related research Harvard supports through its facilities
and staff. But it is also important to know about Harvard’s own role in
polluting activities. Our investigation of Harvard’s investments in fossil
fuels, including fracking, provides a small window into those activities. There
are hundreds of millions of dollars in fossil fuels we can see—and potentially
billions that remain hidden.

To the editor:
It seems to this old graduate that the University’s goal, over many years and with considerable effort, has been to make this place a fair one which also fairly represents every human aspect of our world writ large. Does it make any sense, after having assembled this many-hued, multi-sex, polyglot horde, to encourage them not to act for all in adding, without reservation, the value of their diverse voices but rather to carve themselves up into like-kind groups that wager, at least partially, against the greatest possible common good?
To all my friends, this observation: avoid like the plague any exclusive places—in fact, all of them. Learn to live, straight-up, with your fellow human beings without the benefit of any presumed authority or allegiance or borrowed pride. Lastly, to hell with tribalism. We see its ill effects everywhere. Why should we buy into, however modestly, the petty or actual evils that it brings? Indeed, we should not.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To the Editor:
Next week, I will be celebrating my 25th college reunion here at Harvard.  It isn't too hard to get there; Harvard has been part of my and my husband's professional life for a good chunk of it as faculty.  We met on the river at a party while in college and we now live in Central Square.  Nine blocks in 25 years!
I came to Harvard as the daughter of a Lebanese immigrant family. My parents demanded we work hard in school.  When people ask me why I went to Harvard, I can't remember if I even had a choice.  My father waited for the mail to arrive that day; opened the letter, though it wasn't addressed to him; and a few months later I was at Canaday.
The world, it seemed then, was ours for the taking.  It seemed then, and still does sometimes now, that we were unstoppable.  But, I remember hearing about these Final Clubs as a new student; I did not know what they were, but they suggested to people like me that even though I thought I had made it in, there was still another door to cross.  Exclusive membership based on criteria that were both sexist and inexplicable, they seemed outdated even then.  But their existence and Harvard nexus were a statement that there was still, yet, another Harvard unobtainable to those who thought we had obtained it.
The irony, of course, is that then those most likely to join a Club were those whose access to Harvard in the first place may have been more preordained than not. It is only matched in irony by Finals Clubs adherents today that say that somehow Harvard is denigrating their right to association when that has been what these clubs have done to a great majority of the student body for a long time.
And I say this not simply because of the nostalgia that is overcoming my class in the buildup to our 25th, but because we are returning in the midst of a major debate about what Harvard is meant to be. There will be others who discuss the legality of the Final Clubs decision by the University or whether women are being manipulated to raise the flag of outrage to support the male clubs so they can retain their own.  But, for me, it is worth raising the point that is too often forgotten in these debates: that 25 years ago, it was already clear that exclusive social clubs are inconsistent with the belief, held by so many of us who arrive here from varied and diverse backgrounds, that Harvard's doors are open and inclusive.  Institutions move, albeit slowly, almost as slow as 9 blocks in 25 years.
