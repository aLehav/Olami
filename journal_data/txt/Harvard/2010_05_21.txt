You know how to tell when the school year has truly ended? When the Greenhouse Café (burning your BoardPlus since who-knows-when) has its produce significantly depleted at the end of the year. According to Brad M. Hartman, manager of the Greenhouse Cafe, the devastation inside is due to the last-minute rush to use up BoardPlus dollars.
 
Although those few extra dollars on your card will be gone forever after tomorrow, the Café will still be open throughout the summer. But when we took a peek inside this afternoon, we found half-empty shelves and even emptier serving stations. Check it out.
The Café will be operating on reduced hours until June 14, when the Summer School students arrive. But if you're going to be on campus afterward, rest assured that this oasis of gustatory delight will remain for your taking over the summer.

CORRECTION: May 28, 2010
An earlier version of the May 21 FlyBy post "Greenhouse To Operate on Reduced Hours" incorrectly stated that Greenhouse Cafe would close for an interim period between May 25 and May 31. In fact, it has been operating on a reduced hours schedule for part of the past week that will last until June 14. The full listing of summer hours is available on the Cafe's website. The title has also been changed to reflect the error.

Over the next few days, we'll be pulling snippets from The Crimson archives to commemorate the coming class reunions. You'll see selections from the graduation year of each class celebrating a reunion next week.
The above image of a "modern" young man cramming for a language exam by listening to tapes of French indicates that Harvardians in the 1950s considered themselves on the cutting edge. But they still had a long way to go.
In September, Harvard's maids—yes, the school hired maids—were granted the shocking luxury of a five day work week. "If they had to pick one day, why Saturday, the day that most students entertain in their rooms? Why not some day in the middle of the week, like the barberless Wednesday?" Donald F. McNiel '52 asked at the time.
Maids weren't the only women with whom Harvard men had a less-than-modern relationship. The Crimson reported in awe that a female senior was living in Kirkland (she was married to a tutor). Harvard men also worried about creeping "feminization" if women—already integrated into men's classes—were allowed to join men's clubs.
And back when the semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization was occasionally publishing so-called humor magazines, Cambridge authorities attempted to ban their "satire on the ways, habits, and sense of humor of Midwestern college students and their funny magazines." The parody, dubbed "Pontoon," included a two page spread of cartoons reprinted from Midwestern college magazines, which the Cambridge Police Department termed obscene.
Finally, 1950 also saw several front page stories about an imaginary Haitian Zombie named "Rumin Coak," whom The Crimson relied on to predict the outcomes of football games, although he occasionally ran into trouble with the Feds.

An earlier version of the May 21 FlyBy post "Oldies But Goodies:  Harvard in 1950" incorrectly attributed the quotation "If they had to  pick one day, why Saturday, the day that most students  entertain in their rooms? Why not some day in the middle of the week,  like the barberless Wednesday?" to Duncan H. McCallum '52. In fact, that  statement was made by Donald F. McNiel '52.

UPDATE: May 26, 2010
Individuals who wish to purchase a "Free Adam Wheeler" T-shirt should contact McFadden.
We're willing to bet that life has been rough for Adam B. Wheeler over the past few days, what with all the scandal about his scam that got him a spot at Harvard. But along with the national media frenzy and widespread condemnation of Wheeler, here at Harvard a few individuals have taken up his cause—or have they?
Now, thanks to the efforts of a few seniors, you can get your very own "Free Adam Wheeler" T-shirt.
James A. McFadden '10, one of the creators of the "Free Adam Wheeler" T-shirt enterprise, said the idea came to him and his blockmates out of boredom while sitting in the Greenhouse Café and watching news interviews about the Wheeler scandal. McFadden said the inspiration to make T-shirts was partly this "extremely ridiculous" media coverage.
"We thought that T-shirts were a good way to make a profit," said McFadden. "But we decided it was just important to break even and get his cause out there," he joked.
The shirts, which are made with iron-on transfers, feature the "Free Adam Wheeler" text along with his mugshot on the front, and a copy of his infamous fake resume on the back. The group is selling them for $15, or $5 if you provide your own shirt. McFadden estimated that they've sold about 10 so far, but said they are hoping to "set up shop" at the senior barbecue to sell more.
McFadden emphasized that he does not actually support Wheeler. "I think he’s pretty sketchy and probably morally bankrupt, but he’s a criminal mastermind," he said. "It’s pretty unbelievable and mind-boggling that he pulled this off."
At least onlookers don't seem to be confused. "I haven’t seen any backlash at all," said McFadden. "I expected to get some disapproving looks, but mostly people just congratulated us and told us that they want one."
