After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“With great power comes great responsibility,” said the uncle of Peter Parker, also known as Spiderman, and at the Massachusetts Independent Comics Expo (MICE), it was clear that alternative comics artists were thinking seriously about the responsibility that comes with their expanding influence. For the second year in a row, MICE has attracted independent artists, graphic novelists, and writers hoping to showcase and sell their work. Organizer Dan Mazur  says the expo is important to him because there are “not enough organized events” related to comics. Mazur says he is extremely optimistic about the future of independent comics, because graphic novels are increasingly featuring different kinds of stories, from traditional action and science fiction to jounalism and memoir, as well as catering to non-traditional demographics. He hopes that one day “people will stop asking about superheroes” and recognize the full potential of the medium.
With its main events and showcase at University Hall at Lesley University, MICE has already outgrown its previous location at the Art Institute of Boston. The fair boasted 80 exhibits, varying from classic comic books to independent graphic novels. Exhibitor Allan Dorison makes graphic novels specifically for adults. Dorison prides himself on “trying to get back to the era of comic books when they were free-spirited, and not politically correct.”
Having been head of the Museum of Comic and Cartoon Art in New York, Dorison says he does not draw comics primarily for money. “I enjoy drawing, going to showings, and meeting new people, because [each] show has a different demographic,” he says. Indeed, most of the exhibitors have day jobs that do not involve comics. As exhibitor Erica Henderson points out, it is not the money or her readers that influence her. “I don’t think in terms of who the work is for. I don’t make something for someone, I make something for myself as an outlet for my creativity,” she says.
On the whole, the artists seemed optimistic about the future of comics. Exhibitor Tyler James said to attendees that visited his table that “there has never been better material. All the action is in independent comics.” He added that the increasing number of expos for these artists are evidence of the medium’s growing popularity.
MICE drew a broad and diverse group of attendees. From longtime comics fans to young children, the expo sought to appeal to multiple generations of readers. Others, such as Matt Dursin and Clay Fernald, were there to support their friends, who are independent comics artists. Having tried to publish graphic novels in the past, they appreciated the expo’s work to help promote emerging artists.
Among MICE’s unique offerings were its discussion panels about the issues facing the changing world of graphic art. In the panel “Comics and Teaching,” two local high school teachers and a professor from Emerson College discussed integrating comics into their pedagogy. Michael Gianfrancesco, a high-school English teacher, said that he was open to using comics in his lessons. He said that most high schoolers are becoming reliant on SparkNotes, and that books such as “The Scarlet Letter” are “hard to sell” to tenth-graders. By also teaching graphic novels with similar themes of alienation, Gianfrancesco believes he can make the older classics accessible.
Much like Spiderman, who believed he had a duty to use his talents to help others, the graphic novelists at MICE continue to manipulate their creations to keep them fresh, relevant, and exciting for an ever-expanding audience.

Orientalism, journalism, and “The Lord of the Rings” were just a few of the topics that graphic novelist Craig M. Thompson addressed during a talk and book signing at the Brattle Theatre on September 21. Thompson, who is best known for the graphic novel “Blankets,” based on his youth in an evangelical Christian family, came to Cambridge to promote his newest book “Habibi,” which took him seven years to create.
“Habibi” is a departure for Thompson. While all of his previous work drew on his own life, his latest book is inspired by the culture of the Middle East. Anticipation for the new work was high. “A lot of people have been waiting for this book to come out,” Ryan J. Cook, a Harvard University Information Technology employee, said before the talk. “It’s been a while since he’s had a book of this thickness. And he seems like an interesting person. You want your writers to be interesting.”
It was Thompson’s 36th birthday, and before the talk the audience sang a round of “Happy Birthday” as Heather L. Gain of the Harvard Book Store presented Thompson with a cupcake and balloons.
After thanking Gain and the audience, Thompson explained the genesis of the idea for “Habibi.” After “Blankets,” he had grown tired of telling autobiographical stories and drawing “mundane Midwestern landscapes.” Two genres captivated him—sprawling fantasy epics like “The Lord of the Rings,” and journalistic pieces modeled after the work of fellow cartoonist Joe Sacco. “‘Habibi’ ended up being a combination of the two,” Thompson said. “It’s a fairy tale that draws on contemporary topics such as religion, sexuality, and water crisis.”
Thompson also discussed the opportunities that his latest project afforded him. He had been reading “One Thousand and One Nights” and wanted to explore Middle Eastern folklore in his own work. However, the text also spurred an interest in Orientalism. “I read the Richard Burton translation, which was bawdy, adventurous, and even scatological,” Thompson said. “I started wondering how much of this was from the actual Arabic text and how much of it was Burton’s idea of what the Middle East was like.”
As part of his talk, Thompson displayed a nineteenth-century painting by the American artist Frederick Arthur Bridgman of a Moroccan woman smoking a hookah. “These sensationalized and eroticized paintings say a lot more about Western culture than [about] the Eastern cultures that they’re supposedly depicting,” Thompson said.
According to Thompson, Orientalism strongly influenced the artistic style of “Habibi.” Using designs inspired by Islamic devotional art, Thompson created a style he describes as more “OCD” than that of the much sparser “Blankets.”  He then showed several pages from “Habibi,” all of which were extremely detailed, in the mode of the Islamic ornamentation Thompson cited as an influence. “In a sense, [the book] is a defense of graphic novels as a medium,” Thompson said. “Comics used to be more minimalistic—they were quickly written and turned out.”
The power of comics was a theme to which Thompson returned repeatedly. At one point, he admonished the comics industry for pandering to audiences who prefer pulp to substance. He also spoke about the advantages that comics have over mediums such as film. “Film washes over the viewer—comics are more interactive and they require more of the reader,” Thompson said.
During the book signing, Thompson said that the medium of the graphic novel might be especially apt for a work such as “Habibi,” adding that the book was in part a meditation on words and pictures. The interplay between the two, he continued, would be lost in any other medium.
Both new and old fans of Thompson reacted positively to the talk.  Brighton resident Logan E. Faerber, who became a fan of Thompson in the late 1990s after reading “Good-Bye, Chunky Rice,” said he enjoyed the talk. Somerville resident Lazarus Morrison, who was previously unfamiliar with Thompson’s work, claimed that he “became a fan during [Thompson’s] talk.”
“I think that he has such mastery over what he’s doing,” Morrison said.  “He has an idea of comics in the broader sense, but he’s also got that technical sense. This is his life and this is what he’s devoted himself to.”

What do terrorism, artistic anguish, cross-dressing, Early Modern English, and fart jokes have in common? According to the Boston Playwrights’ Theatre’s world premiere of “Mortal Terror,” quite a lot. The play, written by Robert Brustein—who is also the founder of the American Repertory Theater—runs through October 2 at the Modern Theatre at Suffolk University. Brustein’s script takes a sweeping look at issues pertinent in Shakespeare’s time as well as today, and the downsides of this wide-ranging approach ultimately outweigh its benefits. The play fails to cohere dramatically or thematically, vacillating between terrorism and sordid affairs, comedy and drama.
As the second installment in a three-part series of plays on the life of Shakespeare, “Mortal Terror” is the story of the writing of Shakespeare’s shortest tragedy, “Macbeth.” Brustein represents the genesis of the “Scottish play” not as a stroke of inspiration, but as the result of a commission by King James I (Michael Hammond). The king, unsettled by Guy Fawkes’ plan—now known as the Gunpowder Plot—to blow up Parliament, commands William Shakespeare (Stafford Clark-Price) to write a play about his Scottish ancestors and thereby legitimize his right to the throne. Shakespeare is reluctant to meddle in politics but pragmatically decides to obey the king. Eventually the dark and twisted characters of his own play take over the playwright’s life, give him nightmares, and threaten his faith in humanity. By the end of the show William is in “mortal terror,” afraid of the callous and violent nature of man.
The Modern Theatre is small and intimate, a complement to the nature of the show. The audience is placed right into Shakespeare’s study, where he meets with friends, struggles with the realities of life in uncertain times, and puts the immortal lines of “Macbeth” to paper. A play about the life of Shakespeare makes sense; there is very little biographical knowledge of the English language’s most important writer, so Brustein has plenty of room to put his own face on the Bard. This rendering is witty and sometimes profound, but it fails to solidify.
For all of the success that Brustein has in conveying comedy and drama, neither of these aspects is allowed to be the driving force. This indecision creates a play that is stylistically hermaphroditic. Instead of being a comedy with a few dramatic elements or a drama with a touch of humor, the play is an uncomfortably balanced mixture of both. This might be attributed to the performance choices of the actors, but the script itself must also come into question. The character of Queen Anne (Georgia Lyman), a relatively unimportant historical figure, is well-developed, while Guy Fawkes (John Kuntz) is mostly used for plot points and comic relief. Lyman is an unexpected agent in the dramatic struggle in the play, at one point giving a reading of Lady Macbeth’s lines that stuns William and thickens the darkness in his troubled mind. Meanwhile Kuntz discusses mass murder with his coconspirator with a dry wit that seems like it belongs on Saturday Night Live, not in Elizabethan England.
At heart, “Mortal Terror” is a play about the nature of art. It asks how it is possible for art that is forced upon the artist by higher powers to be as masterful as that which springs from inspiration. Sadly, the play tries too hard to be about other things as well. Does the play want to be a social commentary on religion, intolerance, and terrorism? Its emphasis on the Gunpowder Plot seems to suggest such an aspiration. Does it want to be a play on the abuse of executive power? The mentions of torture and Hammond’s loaded use of the term “enhanced interrogation techniques” point that way. Such thematic wandering makes the show lack unity and compounds the script’s tonal confusion.
Despite these flaws, a strong central character might have stabilized “Mortal Terror.” But William, who ought to be the fullest and most dynamic character, shrinks in comparison to those around him. He has less energy than the swaggering Ben Jonson (Jeremiah Kissel), seems to go through less moral torment than Sir John Harington (Dafydd ap Rees), and acts with less ego and less force of will than either of the royals.
For a play about the life and experiences of Shakespeare, it seems strange that half of the scenes do not involve him at all. At the beginning William worries about reconciling his commission to vindicate the king with his artistic integrity. At the end he questions his earlier faith in mankind and promises never to write another tragedy. At these two points Clark-Price manages to portray a dynamic and complex version of the Bard, but this Shakespeare is not seen for the majority of the play. Brustein’s Shakespeare “struts and frets his hour upon the stage,” but in the end he fails to leave any lasting mark.

“Machine Gun Preacher” tells the life story of Sam Childers, a drug-dealing biker turned child-saving soldier and teacher of the word of Christ. And while Childers’s transformation has radically changed his views and lifestyle, it’s not hard to imagine that the man in the Harley Davidson cutoff vest with a toothpick hanging from his mouth was once someone completely different, a man who might not have approached preaching or social action with a 10-foot pole.
“I was an awful person,” he says. “I did a TV show here not long ago, and when they interviewed me they said, ‘Sam, you’ve rode with about every motorcycle group out there. You’ve run with the worst of them. Who was the meanest person you have ever known?’ I started to cry because I didn’t know anyone meaner than me. I was probably the meanest person you would have ever met 30 years ago.”
He continues, “I was not a tough guy. There’s a difference between a tough guy and a mean guy. And I was mean. [The movie] didn’t even show a fraction of who I really was 30 years ago.”
That’s quite an admission, given that actor Gerard Butler in Marc Forster’s new film depicts Childers abusing his wife, neglecting his child, engaging in illegal drug trades, and even stabbing a hitchhiker. But Childers has put all that behind him, he says. His transformation was inspired by a harrowing bar fight that made him realize that if he continued in his current ways, he could die with no good deeds to his name.
“I was in a bad bar fight in Orlando, FL, that turned into a shootout. I almost got killed. When I went home that night as I was driving I made up my mind: ‘I’m changing.’ I got home, went to bed, and the next morning I told my wife, ‘We’re moving.’ ... I said, ‘Somebody’s gonna kill me, and I ain’t got a problem with dying—but I’ve got a problem with what I’m gonna die for.”
So Childers and his wife moved back to his home state of Pennsylvania. “And it was four years ... until I accepted Christ,” he says.
With his spiritual awakening came a new motivation to do good. As the film shows, Childers then went to East Africa, where he witnessed the atrocities that were taking place in Southern Sudan, committed by warlord Joseph Kony and the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA).
Working to ameliorate the situation, Childers began to develop a reputation in the region. He not only built an orphanage in Southern Sudan and began rescuing and feeding hundreds of children, but he joined the Sudanese soldiers in their military combat against the rebels. He became the “White Preacher”—or the Machine Gun Preacher.
Eventually, NBC Dateline caught word of Childers and featured him in an episode; that inspired Childers to write a book, “Another Man’s War.” He was soon approached by screenwriter Jason Keller for rights to an adaptation.
Childers was at first hesitant. But Keller wouldn’t give up. “He wanted to write the story. So he kept being persistent with me, and then when I O.K.’d him to do the script he basically moved in with me for a year ... He even went further than that—he went to Africa. He interviewed the children, interviewed the soldiers. He went on the actual grounds and stayed for a week and a half at the orphanage. And at that time Marc Forster, the director, did also.”
Now, Childers finds himself grateful for the film. “It’s giving me a platform to speak out on the real truth, and it’s inspiring everyone else to also do something about it,” he says, noting that things in Sudan are much better now than they were pre-2001. Southern Sudan gained its independence in July, and much of the persecution has quieted—but the real problem now is in Darfur.
“We have to remember,” Childers says, “these children are having lips cut off, ears cut off, being cut in half, raped—the worst thing you could think of in your mind is what’s happening to these children. So we have to remember that, in Darfur, it’s still going on.”
And Childers is determined to save children wherever they need saving; his efforts have expanded into Ethiopia, Uganda, and will soon begin in Somalia. “Everywhere we go it’s about helping children,” he says.
Since his early days travelling to and from Sudan on his own, things have certainly changed for Childers. He has founded a non-profit organization called Angels of East Africa, which is currently run by his daughter.
“It’s not about ‘Machine Gun Preacher’ anymore. There’s a lot of other people on with us,” he says. And that title itself—though tattooed on his right bicep—he calls a “marketing tool.”
“It’s not all about violence with us either. I’m very big into education,” he says, citing the fact that he’s built schools, restaurants, and Sudan’s only library as part of his work.
Childers still participates in military combat in East Africa, where he spends about seven months out of every year. He is aware that many feel his contribution to the violence is not the best way to get involved in the situation, but he stands by a line from the movie: “Why don’t you fight the evil in this place your way, and I’ll fight it in mine?”
“You need to run your non-profit the way you do it, and leave me alone,” he says. “I’m not asking for you to come in and structurally form my organization. But I have saved over 1,000 children. I feed right now 3,000 to 3,500 meals a day. I’ve got to be doing something right.”

“There must be a lot of pressure remaking such an iconic 80s movie, huh?” This is essentially how almost every interview begins for Kenny Wormald and Julianne Hough, stars of the upcoming reboot of the Kevin Bacon classic “Footloose.” But they understand that it comes with the territory, and keep a smile on their faces throughout their media tour. “It’s quite a treadmill, but it’s exciting,” says Wormald, a native of Brockton, Mass. “We love the film, so it’s easy to talk about.”
For those living under a pop-culture rock, “Footloose” is the upbeat story of a city boy named Ren (Wormald) who moves with his family to a small, God-fearing Southern town where, thanks to a horrific accident a few years back, rock ‘n roll and dancing have been banned. A classic tale of teen rebellion ensues as Ren cozies up to the local minister’s (Dennis Quaid) beautiful and spirited daughter Ariel (Hough). The two join forces and soon incense the town’s adults with their illicit street dancing.
Given that when anyone hears “Footloose,” they usually think of Kevin Bacon, some actors might balk at attempting to fill the actor’s big shoes. But not so Wormald. “I approached it like it was a new story,” he explains. “[Julianne and I] both know the story so well, growing up seeing it probably 100 times. But I didn’t study it. I didn’t watch it at all ... I didn’t want to be intimidated, you know? It felt like our movie.”
While the original movie is known for its lead actor and punchy music, perhaps its most iconic scene is what has come to be known as the “Angry Dance,” in which Ren lets all his pent-up energy and frustration loose in an intense romp around a barn. “Yeah, that was my favorite scene by far,” says Wormald. “It was the last three days of shooting. I think they did that just in case I broke my leg or fell off the tractor. It’s just such an iconic scene.”
Two relative unknowns on the cinematic circuit, Hough and Wormald were cast more for their dancing prowess than their previous body of work. Though both actors have appeared in films before, dancing has always come first. “It’s pretty much the only thing I’ve ever known,” says Wormald, a ballet dancer. He recalls “Footloose” being a childhood inspiration to him as he grew up in Brockton. “It’s kind of a tough city, you know, and ballet isn’t usually in that category [of manly vocations],” he says. “But, you know, the first time I saw ‘Footloose,’ [at the time] I was 10 and dancing, and at school kids are calling me sissy ... I saw Kevin [Bacon] dancing, and it was masculine and powerful and it was on film; it was something I’d never seen before.”
Hough similarly found her sense of self in the world of dance. “It was the only constant I had in my life. I was moving around constantly, competing, and it was the only thing that didn’t change. It helped my drive and my discipline, my work ethic.”
“And, you know, the guy to girl ratio? Not bad,” quips Wormald. “You all can go shower with guys, I’m going to go dance with like 40 girls.”
The two find their dancing experience to be nothing but beneficial to their acting endeavors. “I don’t think I’m switching, I’ve kind of been [acting] my whole life,” says Wormald. “You’re expressing with your body and mouth and face, so this is just another form of expression.”
Hough agrees. “There’s just so much acting done through not talking. [Kenny and I] are so comfortable with our bodies, so we get that.”
But that doesn’t mean that acting came easily. “Acting is certainly the more challenging for me,” says Hough. “There’s nothing like having the pressure of a $25 million–dollar film to make you feel comfortable,” jokes Wormald. In a more serious vein, he explains how very different it is to prepare for a movie as opposed to the stage. “For the movie, the angle is from far away and all of a sudden they’re zooming in close ... you just have to be aware of surroundings and environment to a T. On the stage, you have a little more freedom.”
Both actors had nothing but praise for their guide and mentor through the process, director Craig Brewer (“Hustle & Flow”). When asked what he brought to their performances, Wormald simply replied, “Everything.” He added, “he was so in love with ‘Footloose,’ and knowing his past work and what he loves ... we just felt so protected. He’s an actor’s director.”
With their passion and skills to guide them, the duo thinks that they have taken a classic movie and made it important and relevant for a new generation. As Hough explains, “There’s really no teen movie out now that has such a message. It’s very controversial, you know ... There are great movies, with CGI and fun stuff to watch, but this means something.”

In the opening scene of Caryl Churchill’s “Far Away,” the lone sound of crickets amidst the darkness accentuates the tranquility of a quaint English countryside. Young Joan (Rebecca H. Kwan ’14), a small girl dressed in a white nightgown, lies in her bed, cradling her stuffed toy elephant in sweet vulnerability and innocence as her aunt Harper (Adriana I. Colón ’12) sits close by darning socks.
This setting seems the picture of suburban contentment. Yet, it is soon clear that the idyll is merely a façade for something far more sinister. Joan recounts a harrowing story of a nightmare turned real: cricket chirps morph into the discordant sound of a scream, her uncle is beating children till blood oozes from their heads, and the floor of the shed is steeped in blood that taints her feet. As she questions an increasingly flustered Harper, who barely pieces together a credible cover-up, the play sharply juxtaposes Joan’s purity with the gruesome horror. The opening scene effectively underscores the dystopian world of global warfare and mass killings created in “Far Away,” directed by Margaret C. Kerr ’13, which ran at the Loeb Experimental Theater from September 22 to 24. “Far Away” is a haunting vision of humanity and chaos portrayed with almost minimalist restraint, an artistic choice that allows the powerful, understated acting to take center stage.
The play follows Joan from childhood (Kwan) to young adulthood (Georgina B. Parfitt, ’13), when she has settled into a career making hats with another milliner, Todd (Yi Jun Tan ’13). A budding romance, a delightful combination of shy uncertainty and witty repartee that belies enduring tenderness, develops between them. The certainty of their love contrasts with the uncertain world in which they live. The audience is left with more questions than answers from their conversations. What are the “trials” that Todd and Joan discuss, as if they were normal television entertainment? Why is the hat industry riddled with corruption? What are the cryptic “parades” in which these outrageously ostentatious hats are used? As the play progresses, the pair’s ominous discussions emerge as harbingers of Hobbesian strife and genocide, revelations which parallel the collapse of the first scene’s pastoral beginning.
Though many mysteries are explained in the course of “Far Away”, the understated, sidelong approach to the play’s weighty subject matter remains. The conversations, while mostly short and charged with tension, convey the violence more effectively than any physical display. Tan powerfully conveys his frustrations with the hat factory, an emblem of society’s ills, through the furtive, surreptitious manner in which he speaks. He is a symbol of humanity’s aversion to injustice and desire for change, yet he—and the rest of the characters—fear being caught criticizing the government. The crisp dialogue thus betrays a fear of speaking up in a society where freedom of expression is harshly curtailed.
To the extent that violence is displayed, it is characterized by a uniform choreography that amplifies the systematic planning and intent behind it. As the prisoners march out in humiliation, the deathly precision of their movements against a backdrop of ominous thunder and flashing lights accentuates a sense of a twisted artistry. The set itself contributes to the bleak atmosphere by using continually changing lighting to resemble a turbulent landscape of dark rolling clouds. Untamed, primal nature serves as a metonym for the darkness that has engulfed society. The melodramatic staging facilitates the subtle, deft manner in which the script and actors confront the controversial subject of mass murder.
The actors carry the weight of such heavy material with practiced ease and confidence. In a poignant scene in which Joan is forced to view the carnage, Kwan’s face portrays an array of emotions stretching from disgust and horror to a numb vacancy. Similarly, Parfitt conveys a weariness of the soul which has seen too much in every heavy, laborious gesture. In the final act, both young and old Joan come together as Kwan and Parfitt harmoniously complete each other’s sentences. Amidst a senseless war where one is not even sure which side the animals are on, the two provide a momentary respite.
“Far Away” as a title suggests that this society is removed, a distant concept of dystopia that does not resonate. Yet the senseless violence and war does recall familiar examples of genocide, terrorism and wars that plague society today. The play evokes a reality too close for comfort.

September 30 to October 2, October 6-8, 7:30 p.m.
Loeb Experimental Theater
Directed by Nasir W. Husain ’12
Produced by Danielle N. Drees ’12
British playwright Sarah Kane’s works are notorious for being graphic and explicitly outlined. “Crave” is a break from that mode of theatricality. Not even genders or ages of characters are given to the director, leaving the field wide open to interpretation. Kane’s “Crave” is centered on four characters referred to only by initials.
Despite the ambiguity of physical and biographical information, each character introduces complex facets of human nature into the play through their dialogue and painfully visible emotions. The Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production of “Crave” differs from past productions in that the characters take more active roles on stage in order to illustrate the depths of their sentiments.
“All of our characters sort of try to work through love and in the end see despair in all its different ways,” says Emily B. Hyman ’13, a Crimson magazine comper. She plays M, a woman nearing the end of her childbearing years who is desperate to raise a child. In the course of the play, she renews a relationship with a previous lover in order to achieve these ends.
Far from idealizing love, “Crave” is about the trials and suffering that are inherently a part of relationships. Renewed devastation is one of the most powerful themes of the performance. “‘Crave’ is about relationships and the things that preclude you [from] relationships,” says director Nasir W. Husain ’12.
For both the audience and the actors, “Crave” is an emotionally raw and powerful experience. Although hardly an hour in length, the “actors are really emotionally exhausted at the end of performing each run,” says Husain. The play delves into the taboos that exist in everyday life and presents the dilemma of how to react towards the sufferings of the characters.
“Even though these characters have attributes that we would criticize in real life, they are people and they go through these incredibly real experiences. It’s hard not to feel for them,” says actor Philip M. Gillen ’13.

For a movie that centers around a fish, there are an awful lot of emotional close-ups of human faces in “Dolphin Tale.” Too much of the movie consists of the ensemble cast—including Harry Connick Jr., Ashley Judd, Kris Kristofferson, and Morgan Freeman—seemingly trying their hardest to teach the film’s young audience how to convey facial expressions of anxiety, bewilderment, despair, determination, awe, and jubilation. These images represent the main problem with this well-intentioned film: director Charles Martin Smith injects too many life lessons and tear-jerking moments into a movie that is at its most inspiring when it merely captures its protagonist swimming happily in the water. Although “Dolphin Tale” is at points very likeable and artfully filmed, it is eventually doomed by the simple fact that it is a heavy-handed melodrama that clumsily exploits a storyline about a dolphin who loses his tail.
“Dolphin Tale” follows a nondescript Floridian young boy named Sawyer (Nathan Gamble), who—like all other young male protagonists—is searching for an adventure. When he helps cut loose an ensnared dolphin on the beach and in the process meets a cute girl, he suddenly transforms into a passionate marine lover who skips school to aid the dolphin’s recovery. A day-to-day depiction of the progress of the dolphin, Winter, is evidently not enough to carry the movie on its own, and so the filmmakers interweave that story with moments of high-strung tension in the surrounding town. These scenes focus on the impact on Clearwater, Fla., of some of the dire crises that the United States has faced in the past year, including war, natural disaster, and financial shortcomings. But each new, quickly unfolding calamity feels more like a diversion thrown in to raise the emotional stakes of the movie rather than offer essential plot development.
Moreover, the film largely dilutes the effects of these tragic happenings and thereby renders them almost meaningless. Thus, Sawyer’s cousin Kyle (Austin Stowell) returns home from war with a useless leg, but is otherwise perfectly fit and spirited by the end of the film. A hurricane hits the town with force, but has little direct effect on the wellbeing of the protagonists. And the financial difficulties of the Clearwater Marine Aquarium—a source of continual anxiety and despair throughout the movie—prove insubstantial as well, for we never witness the impact of these supposed troubles, but rather just hear people talk about them. Throughout the film, there is a lack of funds but no poverty; there is crippling injury but little loss of health. In this way, “Dolphin Tale” attempts to touch upon many important contemporary social dilemmas, but instead cheapens each one.
The visuals of the movie alternate between gorgeous underwater shots and headache-inducing landlocked ones. The film’s 3D cameras do especially well in portraying water in all of its forms—the way feet wade across a wet surface, the manner in which reflected trees shimmer in a muddy pool, and how water drips, splashes, bubbles, and swells. Winter the dolphin and his undersea companions are also expertly captured in all of their exuberance—indeed, the movie’s opening montage will make many viewers wish they could see an extended IMAX feature about the deep at the Boston Aquarium. In one of the film’s best moments, a beautiful scene shot entirely underwater, Winter and Kyle swim and frolic together in perfectly distilled childhood exhilaration.
But the camera has much more trouble on land. In the film’s all too frequent close-ups, the sides of human faces often look shinier than Winter’s skin, and the background of motion shots often appears shaky or blurred. Taken together, “Dolphin Tale” offers examples of both the potential and the pitfalls of 3D cinematography, while not quite justifying the medium.
“Dolphin Tale” ends predictably, with its marine hero returning to the sea and lots of hugs and family bonding all around. But the payoff is dulled by the film’s saccharine coating of its drama. Ultimately, “Dolphin Tale” teaches that hardship can be overcome with determination and effort ... and a team of smart and understanding people who have a lot of time on their hands and money to burn. In the end, one suspects that a Morgan Freeman–narrated documentary about dolphins in their natural habitats would have felt less forced and proven much more compelling.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Moneyball” is the quintessential anti-sports movie. It is a baseball film in which the actual game barely features, and the players themselves are given mere bit parts in their own story. There is no inspiring pep talk delivered by a charismatic coach, and no swelling, adrenaline-pumping victory anthem in the movie’s rather pedestrian soundtrack. There isn’t even a championship game. Every human element of the traditional sports film—the cathartic emotional highs, the gritty and grizzled athletes, the intense and sweaty close-ups—has been mercilessly excised. All of which is quite fitting, given that “Moneyball” is essentially about the irrelevance of each of these to the game of baseball.
The film’s storyline, adapted from Michael Lewis’s celebrated book, tells how Oakland Athletics General Manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) constructed a winning team at a fraction of the usual price by exploiting various market inefficiencies within baseball. Armed with the statistical models of Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), a Yale-trained economist—in reality Paul DePodesta, a Harvard-trained economist who did not allow the film to use his name—Beane signed undervalued players off the scrap heap for bargain prices, crafting a team which went on to win 103 games, including an American League record 20 in a row.
What makes “Moneyball” so singular—and superb—is what it does with this premise. One could easily have taken Lewis’s material and turned it into a feel-good film—the tale of a small-market General Manager, his overweight stat nerd adviser, and their team of misfits who defied the baseball world and in the process revolutionized the game itself. But screenwriters Aaron Sorkin and Steve Zaillian—two of Hollywood’s finest—are too clever for cliché. Instead, along with director Bennett Miller, they create a witty, reflective movie that ingeniously conveys its message through its images, characterization and direction.
Visually, “Moneyball” demonstrates its preference for detached number-crunching over feats of individual athleticism by not actually showing much baseball. Like Beane—who spends his team’s games in the stadium weight room while following them on the radio—the audience is left to observe the Athletics at a clinical distance. Viewers learn of their success through animated standings and the brief voiceovers of announcers, not by watching them play baseball. During the rare scenes of the sport, there are no emotional close-ups of the players exerting effort or showcasing their talent. Indeed, when we do meet them in the clubhouse, the Athletics are mostly a laughingstock, on display in the film not for their skills but for comic relief. There is the hapless Scott Hatteberg (Chris Pratt), who really can’t play first base and is deathly afraid of the ball being hit his way; the fundamentalist Christian Chad Bradford (Casey Bond) who earnestly tells Billy Beane that he’s praying for him; and the juvenile clubhouse clown, Jeremy Giambi (Nick Porrazzo).
This trivialization of the sport’s ostensible principals is intended by the filmmakers. When it comes to the players in “Moneyball,” we are simply not meant to care about them. For the film’s point is that when baseball is properly understood, the particular individuals populating the diamond, the emotional storylines taking place in the clubhouse, and the theatrics happening on the field are all distractions from the statistical nuts and bolts which actually determine whether a team wins or loses. An obscenely paid superstar may offer a face for a franchise—and a hero for a traditional sports film—but the lesson of “Moneyball” is that such a player can easily be replaced by two or three relative unknowns whose combined stats duplicate his production at a fraction of the cost. For both Beane and the screenwriters who bring his narrative to life, baseball is about percentage points and probabilities, not people.
Bennett Miller’s minimalist direction is a perfect fit for this cerebral storyline, ideal for a film that consciously eschews the pyrotechnics of traditional sports movies in favor of a more deliberate, calculated approach to the game. That said, Miller’s methodical technique occasionally shades into monotony, as in the plodding shot-reverse-shot scenes of Beane’s conversations with the team’s owner.
The excellent screenplay of “Moneyball” displays the talents of its two craftsmen. The effortless transposition of an intellectual idea into a workable dramatic storyline is the hallmark of Aaron Sorkin—demonstrated most recently in “The Social Network”—while the movie’s entertaining banter hearkens back to his short-lived series “Sports Night.” At the same time, the script’s more leisurely pace—distinct from Sorkin’s usual whip-smart rapid-fire dialogue—bears the imprint of Steve Zaillian, writer of the more measured “Schindler’s List” and “Searching for Bobby Fischer.”
But while the creative choices of the screenwriting team compensate for some of the inherent weaknesses in the film’s source material, no amount of clever narrative framing can change the historical fact that the Athletics never even made it to a championship game, and instead got eliminated in the first round of the playoffs. Such an abrupt close to the team’s season makes for an off-kilter ending to the movie, despite the writers’ best efforts.
Of course, such purposeful plotting, characterization and direction would be for naught without capable performers—but Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill are more than up to the task. Hill’s geeky, self-conscious Brand offers the ideal straight man to Pitt’s charismatic Beane, and both actors give rich, sympathetic performances. The only casting misstep is Philip Seymour Hoffman as team manager Art Howe; the character’s functional dialogue and one-note personality make it seem like Hoffman is there more due to his relationship with the director—the two collaborated on Miller’s first drama, “Capote”—than any need in the script.
Making a movie about an idea is always a risky proposition, and doing so while bucking the traditional conventions of a genre courts cinematic confusion. For these reasons, “Moneyball” almost never made it to the screen—during production, the film rapidly shed directors and screenwriters and was even temporarily shelved by the studio. A lesser group of filmmakers than Miller, Zaillian, and Sorkin would have been undone by the demands of the material, or reduced it to a forgettable formula. Yet the production team of “Moneyball” has managed to craft a film that is thoughtful rather than thrilling, while still keeping audiences entertained—in other words, a movie as odd, unlikely, and endearing as the team whose story it tells.

“Modern Family”, a show detailing the lives of three unconventional families, started their new season with unusual fanfare. On Sunday, the show swept the Emmys, winning a multitude of awards, and becoming—as host Jane Lynch noted—“The Modern Family Awards.” Actors Ty Burrell and Julie Bowen, who play couple Phil and Claire Dunphy, won early in the night, but the trophies accumulated rapidly as the ceremony commenced, culminating with a repeat win for Outstanding Comedy Series.
While there will be those cynics that will use the show’s big night as justification for backlash and complaints of commercialization, the fact is that “Modern Family” has a universality that allows both the college student and the middle-aged man to come together and laugh. And this accessibility is not a bad thing. If anything, it’s a prime display of a group of writers and actors who are brave enough to avoid a niche audience, and instead tackle the grueling task of appealing to the mass. It’s what distinguishes good shows from great shows and what ultimately drew in Emmy voters. The charm of “Modern Family” comes from providing smart humor that is not only all-inclusive, but also resonant, which is ever so apparent its back-to-back episodes that kicked off season three last Wednesday.
The first episode, “Dude Ranch,” starts off with the crew during their vacation at Lost Creek Ranch where the local cowboy guide Hank (Tim Blake Nelson) eloquently proclaims, “You’re going to ride. You’re going to rope. You’re going to shoot.” Needless to say, the episode interweaves various plotlines as Cam (Eric Stonestreet) and Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) contemplate adopting another child in addition to Lily (who has been replaced by actress Aubrey Anderson-Emmons), Phil struggles to please father-in-law Jay (Ed O'Neill), and Haley’s boyfriend Dylan goes missing.
The success of “Modern Family” lies in its grounding to reality and striking a delicate balance between slapstick humor and subtlety. Never relying on tropes like food flinging and crude zingers, its humor comes primarily from a recognition that the everyday things are typically the funniest things. Too often sitcoms devolve into the loudest, most obnoxious jokes and outlandish situations. With the start of the season, “Modern Family” acknowledges that—while not every person has had never-to-be-heard-again shenanigans in Las Vegas—everyone has felt the awkwardness of a first kiss like Alex (Ariel Winter) in “Dude Ranch,” or gone to indescribable ends to prove that they are right like Claire in the second episode of the night, “When Good Kids Go Bad.”
The characters of “Modern Family” encompass a wide range of personalities from different backgrounds that strikes a chord of resemblance and kinship. Chances are that the viewing audience knows a Gloria (Sofia Vergara) or that they are a Claire, and that’s what makes the emotional element show so significant and rich. The show is not a series of errors and comedic mishaps. It’s a real narration about the ordinary lives of three very different families that are interconnected.
As Phil states perfectly, “…we may have lost a man, but out there in the range under that great big sky, we found a part of ourselves we didn’t know was there. Like the horny cowboy said we would.” Welcome back, “Modern Family.” Wednesday nights have been lacking without you.

In the basement of Memorial Church, a single mesmerizing voice floated up from 30 participants in a recreational chanting group. Thomas F. Kelly, Morton B. Knafel Professor of Music, began to lead the group through Latin psalms and hymns taken from the Gregorian chanting tradition.
The members of this group, in their first meeting this past Wednesday, sang music steeped in history. According to Professor Kelly, “[Gregorian chanting is] one of the longest, if not the longest-lived traditions of music in the world.” Dating back to the High Middle Ages, this music was sang for Compline—one of the last waking hours in the monastic day—at the end of every day in monasteries throughout the Holy Roman Empire.
Today, members of the College, the Divinity School, and the Extension School bring the music back to life weekly in this low-commitment group. Ed Post, a student at the Extension School, heard about the group and decided to give it a try. “I don’t have any experience in chanting, but it sounded interesting,” he said. Though these meetings are not counted as a class and there are currently no performances scheduled, there is still a strong interest in this type of liturgical music amongst the group. Members from the first meeting have diverse musical backgrounds and are drawn to chanting for vastly different reasons, according to Professor Kelly. For some, chant is still at the heart of Catholic liturgical music and retains its value as an instrument of prayer. For others, chant is used in meditation as an alluring aspect of the more trendy New Age movement.
Professor Kelly, the leader of this group, is drawn to chant for its dedication to unity. Gregorian chant does not have harmony, counterpoint, or accompaniment. All choir members, whether monks from the High Middle Ages or modern Extension School students, chant the Latin verses in complete unison. In the age of the Holy Roman Empire, these songs would have been performed in monasteries throughout Europe at the same time. They would unite their voices to become a single community. Professor Kelly hopes to recreate this sense of unity in the new group.
At the beginning of practice, the cantor gave no introduction to the music and no background. One moment he was handing out pamphlets of music, and the next the choral hall filled with the call to Compline. This 12- to 15-minute service marked the end of the day in monasteries. Afterwards, monks would not talk until the sun rose the next morning.
To teach chanting, the cantor, in this case Kelly, sings a verse of a psalm or hymn and the choir repeats the antiphon, or response. According to Michael S. Cuthbert, associate professor of music at Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has participated in groups with Kelly in the past, “Prof. Kelly has an amazing ability to shape the sounds we amateurs make into real music.” The group represented a wide spectrum of musical experience, and yet all of the members could sing through the 20-minute Compline service by the end of the session. While the musical notation can be complicated and the Latin can be dense, the structure of chanting lends itself well to learning.

It’s always a strange thing to wish someone were back on drugs. Jeff Tweedy wrote two of the most critically claimed albums of the 2000s—“Yankee Hotel Foxtrot” and “A Ghost is Born”—while under the influence of painkillers and depression. Then he got clean, released the hokey “Sky Blue Sky” and the irritatingly self-referential, though marginally improved “Wilco (The Album).” Wilco’s latest, “The Whole Love,” suggests a similar move towards retro-pop irrelevance and, worse, the oft-invoked genre “dad rock.” While this album, as with the last two, has several absolutely brilliant songs, it mainly furthers Wilco’s descent into irrelevant tastefulness.
The strangest thing about this record is its superficial similarities to Wilco’s third album, the brilliantly twisted “Summerteeth.” This album took classic ‘60s pop forms and incongruously adorned them with psychotic themes, impressionistic lyrics, and a crushing sense of depression. Where this reimagining of classic pop music made the old seem new, Wilco dabbles in the same forms on “The Whole Love,” only this time their aim is rote emulation rather than innovation. “Dawned On Me” continues pop music’s love affair with meaningless poetic contradictions—”Heart of coal / Heart of gold”—and the instrumentals consist of a basic chord structure played by mumbling, distorted guitars over an unimaginative drum beat. Songs like this, “Sunloathe,” and “Standing O” seem like pointless rehashings of old cultural forms.
Occasionally, though, Wilco strikes A.M. gold, as on “Born Alone.” Here the sanguine bass and small, tight drums lightly push Tweedy’s more imaginative lyrical performance. His first verse is provocative, if elliptical: “I have heard the wall and worry of the gospel / Ferry Faust it crossed a void / I have married broken spoke charging smoke wheels / Spit and swallowed opioid.” The quirky sunny quality of the verse shifts eloquently into the taut, climactic chorus guitar line. The title track’s rollicking organ arpeggios, acoustic guitar octaves, and light-footed guitar lines also make for a glorious, eminently listenable, carefree pop song. “Capitol City,” with its goofy Randy Newman jaunt and self-conscious winks of atmospheric noise, is a joy, but it’s little more than a small pop song, cautiously assembled as if the group were following instructions. A bit more than a minute into the song, a rustling of noise similar to the opening of “Wishful Thinking” floods the background before rapidly fading, only serving as a brusque reminder that Wilco’s artistic mission has shifted from innovative sonic craftsmanship and soulful emotional excavation to faithful, contented emulation.
Wilco’s best songs have always been deconstructed or blown-up folk songs—see “Poor Places” or “I Am Trying to Break Your Heart”—and their new sonic identity allows them room for gracefully unadorned folk songs. While this freedom also permits irritating, corny filler like “Open Mind,” the album’s delicate 12-minute closer, “One Sunday Morning (Song for Jane Smiley’s Boyfriend),” is one of their finest recordings to date. Tweedy introduces each of his perfect couplets with a devastatingly penetrating line that he follows with equally poetic exposition—“I fell in love with the burden / Holding me down”— and the band punctuates each verse with the melodic refrain, a piano and guitar riff that nears the elegant simplicity of “Ashes of American Flags.” As Tweedy sings, the instrumentals that often sound unfocused throughout the album meander in and out of musical representations of the lyrics—a piano trill evoking “I feel relief / I feel well,” for instance, and a set of ghostly parallel fifths cascading down like bells on Sunday morning.
The most concerning song on the album is “Art of Almost,” a seven-minute opener similar to the Krautrock “Spiders (Kidsmoke)” off “A Ghost is Born.” The occasional bursts of noise, constant pulse of synthesizer, and skittish drums seem like clear attempts at a Radiohead-esque tightly constructed freak-out. However, its experimental bursts, fuzzed out guitars and bass, and meticulous production are so excessively tasteful as to neuter the song. “Almost” replicates in miniature the entire album’s unspoken aesthetic of calculated risk—of artful almosts. Despite this, the record’s best tracks are so stellar as to maintain what might seem an otherwise unjustified faith in the group that gave us some of the best music of the new millennium.

Alternative musicians often seem intent on being nostalgic either for the past, or antiquated depictions of the future. On their debut LP, “In Heaven,” New York quintet Twin Sister set up pop tracks that embrace both the now-popular sounds of post-punk and a broader swath of past sounds. The album marries an even, computerized feel with genres as disparate as disco’s flair and Spaghetti Western scores. Their breadth makes for a fresh and offbeat production, but consistent elements in their songwriting keep the album from feeling like an unfocused jumble.
Delicate opener “Daniel” starts with sweet, clear synthesizer tones, and then introduces a shuffling electronic beat with soft keyboards trailing beneath it. By “Spain” and “Gene Ciampi,” more than halfway through the album, twanging guitar figures and sweeping strings replace the synthesizers with a cinematic European flair. “Daniel” and “Spain” mark the poles of the album’s improbable tonal spectrum, but Twin Sister muster enough instrumental versatility to pull off Spanish guitar as convincingly as tight, computerized beats.
While these tracks each devote themselves to one familiar aesthetic, the album’s most captivating songs smoothly consolidate elements of multiple styles. On these compositions—“Bad Street,” which pairs skittering synthesizers with a Talking Heads strut, and “Stop,” which puts strings and a funky bass line under a psychedelic keyboard jumble—the instrumentals are adeptly mixed, with each component holding down its own melody rather than seeming an afterthought or accent. Within themselves, the tracks bridge modern synth-pop and elegant facsimiles of past sounds.
But Twin Sister’s own sound exists beyond their collagic tendencies. The album is marked by consistent songwriting choices that cohere and sharply define the band’s modus operandi. Twin Sister impose a standard structure on many of their amalgamations, and their rock steady beats and short, cyclical instrumental lines that loop tirelessly drive each track confidently. And in all of their compositions, the band avoids gratuitous layering and inaccessibly thick, hazy soundscapes. Every instrument instead seems to have its own clearly discernible melody, and the resulting layered tracks feel both rich and streamlined. All these components are tied together by lead singer Andrea Estella’s tender, powerful vocals. She inflects her unwavering notes with wistfulness, desperation, or whim on almost every track. Her stellar vocal performance is thrown into sharp relief by the album’s weakest track “Eastern Green,” which features a flat male vocalist. Overall, these consistent techniques lend clear character to Twin Sister’s sound while the band liberally experiments with genre, and restrain the album from spiraling into chaos.
Their infrequent deviations from this consistent style weaken the album. On “Gene Ciampi” and “Saturday Sunday,” they let their pop sensibility shine, brilliantly if briefly. The former kicks off with a catchy, trebly guitar riff, full of risqué swagger, while the latter revels in lazy, summery guitar pop and builds to an irresistible chorus. However, the tracks’ indulgence in echo, fuzz, and overlapped melodies, and their underemphasized beats, seem incongruous with the rest of the album. The tracks stand strong individually, but since so much of “In Heaven” balances stylistic exploration with subtly strict structures, they feel confused and disjointed in the larger context of the album as a whole.
The music world seems ever inclined to invent subgenres using the suffix “pop”—synth-pop, dance-pop, chamber pop, dream-pop, Afropop—but “In Heaven” pleasantly and inconspicuously eludes clear categorization. The album never settles into one genre for long before flitting to another, but it works best when it doesn’t show off its juxtapositions, instead evenly mixing past and modern influences in a steady structure. Though they miss this narrow mark on occasion, Twin Sister’s ability to juggle so many genre hallmarks displays admirable finesse.

Last week, Harvard escaped from a bizarre and potentially damaging lawsuit after federal judge George A. O’Toole, Jr. threw out a request from a group representing victims of Iranian terrorist attacks to seize various Persian artifacts from Harvard. Still awaiting unpaid damages that a U.S. court ruled they were owed by the Iranian government, the group—under the leadership of Jenny Rubin—has recently set its sights on certain artifacts they believe to be the property of the Iranian government. Unfortunately for the plaintiffs, however, these artifacts are held in various collections such as the University of Chicago’s Oriental Institute and Harvard’s Peabody Museum, which acquired them long before the Islamic Republic of Iran was established in 1979.
And while Judge O’Toole’s ruling appears in part a straightforward and appropriate rejection of what seems a patently opportunistic attempt to benefit financially from both the tainted reputation of the Iranian regime and a warped view of history, it included a broader stance on the issue surrounding the ownership of formerly stolen artifacts—a controversy in which Harvard’s own position, in our view, warrants a re-evaluation.
“As a general matter,” O’Toole wrote, “establishing that a particular item was unlawfully exported or removed from Iran is not equivalent to showing that it now should be regarded as property of Iran subject to levy and execution.”
Of course, we cannot imagine any other appropriate response to such an attempt. After all, the argument of Rubin et al concerns an alleged—and obviously false—association between the Persian Empire and the belligerent Iranian Islamic “Republic” that currently exists within its former borders. But, even still, we worry that these words may set some sort of dangerous legal precedent that gives Western institutions such as Harvard the right to keep artifacts regardless of the circumstances under which they were acquired. While Harvard has a very good argument for keeping possession of the particular items concerned in the Rubin case, it’s troubling that this case may only lead to Western institutions keeping a tighter stranglehold over the rest of the world's stolen cultural heritage.
As an institution at the forefront of learning and education, Harvard's steady acquisition of numerous artifacts whose provenance spans both time and space falls into a tradition of prominent historical collections held by universities. While not quite the Ashmolean, our Sackler and Peabody Museums, amongst others, house many rare and notable artistic and historical materials. Many of these pieces, it must be said, were acquired around the turn of the last century, at the same time or soon after many of this country’s great international collections were assembled in museums and at other universities. It is of course no coincidence that the acquisition of many of these items from cultures such as Ancient Egypt, China, Greece, and the Islamic Middle East came during a period of unparalleled Western hegemony. And it is no secret that many of the Western world's most famous collections, such as the British Museum's storied Elgin Marbles, were effectively stolen from their territories of origin. Much of the finest Chinese porcelain that today adorns many museums and private homes was looted from Beijing's Old Summer Palace during the nineteenth century, coming as revenge for China's role in the Opium Wars and Boxer Rebellion.
A walk through any major museum—be it the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, the British Museum in London, or the Louvre in Paris—would show that Harvard takes a backseat in the saga of Western museums proudly holding onto artifacts that others want back. Many of the circumstances in which these objects were taken do not amount to the trope of a civilizing mission that is so frequently used to justify Lord Elgin's seizing of the Elgin marbles: Look again, for instance, to the looting of the Forbidden City in the summer of 1900 by the Eight-Nation Alliance. And even when objects were taken from their areas of origin for the purposes of protecting them, why not follow Harvard's own example of returning the Lowell Bells to Moscow after 50 years of safeguarding them? For too long, museums in Western Europe and the United States have jealously clung to objects to which they have no underlying valid claim. As a rule, they should begin returning them to the many nations of Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Asian and others who now have the ample resources to take care of them.
We would not dispute that collections in the great Western museums have served as infinite sources of education, enjoyment, and awe for countless residents and tourists of these cities. There is even an argument to be made that more people across the world encounter and learn from these artifacts in a Western museum than would were they all returned to the sites of their creation. However, the purpose of a historical artifact is the rare insight it affords the world of the present into the world of the past, and the value of that insight depends upon a conversation between an object’s current home and the site of its creation. In moving forward, we urge Harvard to consider following the example of peer institutions like Yale, which, after a lawsuit of its own from the Peruvian government over certain Incan artifacts taken years before, is moving to create a jointly operated research center slated to open in October.
This question of artifacts stolen years ago in different times from national entities that no longer exist is indeed a complicated one. We can only hope that Harvard’s approach in the future will be one of active engagement with the cultures from which many of the artifacts in its museums were taken and that the Rubin case doesn’t set a precedent of stifling discourse between East and West.

“Who is John Galt?” To those unfamiliar with Ayn Rand’s best-selling novel Atlas Shrugged, it’s the repeated question everyone asks out of futility as they consider the declining state of the world. Whole industries are collapsing, fortunes and savings disappearing, and unprecedented government regulations and mandates seem unable to stop the bleeding. The only man capable of turning things around is John Galt himself, the genius inventor capable of lifting the world to new heights. John Galt may be Ayn Rand’s fictional creation, but his struggles are relevant to the world today. As the President and Congress seek ways to overcome the malaise of a struggling economy, they must ensure that new and existing policies allow innovators and job creators to succeed.
Obama responded to the most recent economic crisis with a series of liberal legislation and nominees that Democrats have been dreaming of for decades. The majority of Americans may have disagreed with his policies, but he was at least proposing ideas. Two years later, the U.S. had nil net job growth in August, unemployment still above 9 percent and a President lecturing Congress to repeat his past, failed policies, expecting better results. Breaking down Obama’s speech on September 8th, it’s obvious that the President has run out of ideas about what else government could do to help. Instead, he should consider the alternative: stopping what government is doing to hurt job creation.
“Everyone knows that small businesses are where most new jobs begin,” Obama correctly stated during the speech. A recent survey of 1409 small business owners in the U.S. asked them to name the top challenges to their business. The top five results: economic uncertainty, America’s growing debt and deficit, the 2010 healthcare bill, over-regulation and high taxes. At least four of these are promoted by the Obama administration. His Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act raises the effective marginal tax rate on small businesses that hire more than 25 employees and places a $2,000 penalty on businesses with 50 or more employees that do not provide health insurance. Simply put, Obama wants small businesses to provide jobs, but not too many. If you’re the next Mark Zuckerberg, hiring only your best friends is probably too few, but expanding to Silicon Valley is right out. As former Congressional Budget Office Director Douglas J. Holtz-Eakin testified, “There is no theory or empirical research on job creation that suggests that large tax increases will spur employment. Taken at face value, one should be skeptical that PPACA will not harm the pace of overall economic recovery.”
Obama insisted in his speech that “these men and women grew up in an America where hard work and responsibility paid off.” Unless, of course, you are a large corporation. Boeing, America’s largest exporter of manufactured products, has loyally kept its large manufacturing presence in America as other companies have sought cheaper labor abroad. The company currently has 827 Dreamliner aircrafts on order, worth $162 billion and critical to its future. Well behind its schedule of production, Boeing decided to build a $750 million facility in South Carolina and create 5,000 new jobs. At least that was the plan, until the National Labor Relations Board, backed by the Obama Administration, decided to file a complaint and force Boeing to abandon its South Carolina plant and 5,000 new employees. NLRB claims that was retaliating against its union workforce in Washington, despite the fact that Boeing had also hired 3,000 union workers in Washington since constructing the plant in South Carolina. The suit is unprecedented, without legal standing and, worst of all, absolutely destructive. A government agency has decided to change the rules without warning and filled the economy with greater uncertainty, making it increasingly riskier for businesses to hire and succeed.
John Galt decided to abandon his plans to succeed because of increasingly hostile attitudes and policies towards innovation and competition. If many of Obama’s policies continue, businesses large and small may soon find themselves in his shoes. Government exists to promote prosperity and create a free market where rights are protected and reasonable regulations allow businesses to compete with limited negative externalities. It exists to enforce the rules consistently. When it changes the rules arbitrarily and creates unlevel playing fields, the result is crony capitalism, corrupt government and economic disaster.
So, who is John Galt? He’s the small businessman drowning in the red tape of regulation. He’s the business owner afraid to hire because he doesn’t know what government will throw at him next. He’s the individual who, when asked by government how to fix the economy, had but one thing to say: “Get the hell out of my way!” That’s an idea worth trying.

Nobody ever said economists were perfect. Economics necessarily smoothes away the complicated marginalia of actual economic life, in order to produce models that will work simply and fairly accurately. Generally this does not pose too much of a problem. But when a simplifying assumption of economic models becomes a piece of common wisdom; when it is allowed to dictate policy as though it were true rather than merely convenient to suppose, then it becomes necessary to purge this assumption from our discourse. I’ll be taking on one such assumption right now: the claim that higher marginal income tax rates discourage work. Though an article of faith in economic policy, this misguided belief actually stems from inaccurate assumptions made to simplify economic arguments. When compared to the real world, it simply does not hold water.
Before writing about marginal income tax rates, I should clarify what those are, and address a common misconception. The idea behind marginal income taxes is that people who are wealthier ought to pay a large fraction of their wealth in taxes than people who have less. The way that this is accomplished is through a series of tax brackets with different rates.
However, the rates are not applied to one’s entire income, only the money earned in each particular bracket. Imagine that there were only two brackets: ten percent up to $100,000 and 20 percent above that. Someone making $100,001 isn’t taxed 20 percent on their entire income (or $20,000.20), they’re taxed ten percent on the first $100,000 and 20 percent only on that extra dollar (for $10,000.20) total. If the rates were applied one’s entire income, it would be possible to earn more and take home less after taxes, since they are only applied to the marginal dollar—that is, the money earned above the limit, this is never possible. Under an ordinary progressive income tax, it is never possible to earn more and take home less. You just take home a slightly smaller slice of that extra dollar.
Nevertheless, some argue that higher marginal income tax rates discourage productivity. The argument goes something like this. People choose how much they work, weighing time spent working against leisure time. High marginal rates mean that working more is slightly less valuable than it would otherwise be, making leisure time comparably more attractive, encouraging people to rest rather than work, and discouraging economic activity.
This argument may seem compelling, but it is fundamentally in error. First, it misrepresents how working people make decisions about spending. The idea of working more hours in order to buy a greater quality of leisure time may make sense to the child who picks up a paper route in order to buy new videogames. But adults, even very wealthy adults, do not think this way. Instead, adults work to maintain a standard of living. That standard of living may be high, but once one reaches it, it’s hard to give up.
First-year associates and senior partners at a law firm both manage to spend their entire paycheck each month on “necessities,” despite the differences in income—because the senior partners have assumed ongoing costs (larger mortgages, expensive vehicles, domestic service, etc.) that they are loathe to give up. In short, adults at nearly every level of income work not to goof off but to make the bills. Since the bills are still there, regardless of the marginal income tax rates, adults do not decide to work less because it’s slightly less valuable. They rely on taking home the same amount a month and can’t simply give that up.
Second and even more importantly, by and large people do not and cannot choose exactly how much they’ll work for tax reasons. High-paying jobs are not available by the hour for specified pay; instead, they have assigned work and uncertain return. A doctor works when patients are sick; one can’t shirk a night of call for tax purposes. Lawyers can’t tell which client will push them into the next tax bracket, and they couldn’t afford to pass up that client if they could. Investment bankers can work up to one hundred hours a week; the job demands that amount of time. None of these highly paid professionals are slacking off because of the marginal income tax rate. They couldn’t if they wanted to.
Tax policy is a fantastically complex subject, and it’s not always easy to see which competing theory is in the right. But like all government policy, it must ultimately apply at the level of ordinary, individual citizens. If we base our policy on arguments that contradict everything we know about how professionals actually work and live, we’re making a terrible mistake.

On September 15, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU)—the specialized technology agency of the United Nations—released new figures showing an acceleration of broadband uptake and a decline in broadband prices worldwide. According to the report, the U.S. boasts a respectably high level of broadband uptake and some of the lowest broadband prices in the world.
Over the past decade, 290 million Americans (95 percent of the population) have gained access to broadband Internet. To those fixated on economic growth, the widespread availability of affordable broadband has narrowed the digital divide, laying the groundwork for accelerated job creation and workforce development in an increasingly digital economy. To folks in public education, broadband holds the potential to immediately address issues of educational access, equity of opportunity, and public transparency.
Broadband connections are the building blocks of “digital classrooms,” in which highly-customizable digital learning resources replace one-text-fits-all print materials to expand the quality and variety of online solutions available to support teaching and learning.  In these classrooms, broadband powers learning environments that respond in real-time to individual student needs and move aggressively to elevate achievement.
From a basic civil rights perspective, universal broadband promotes equity of access and opportunity among students.  Put simply, quality broadband service ensures that a student from rural America can access the same resources as a student from the heart of New York City.  Broadband’s potential to further our national goals for education is readily apparent, as is the tremendous progress that has been made to date. The task of ensuring access and meaningful use for students, though, is far from complete.
Students spend an average of 7.5 hours per day using technology to access information and people, and 71 percent of teens say that the Internet was their primary source for a recent school project. Despite mounting evidence that students rely on online resources to help them learn throughout the day, one in every four students still does not have home access to broadband. The lack of broadband access and meaningful use impacts rural schools, which host a full fifth of the nation’s student population, most heavily.
The disparity between the digital needs of all students and the inadequate broadband many receive is unacceptable. The education community needs to take leadership for ensuring access and meaningful utilization for all students. We must leverage broadband development and deployment to address deep-seated inequities and to promote 21st-century teaching and learning.
For example, educators and policymakers have considered the use of student-owned devices in broadband-equipped classrooms. These devices enable students to utilize technology that they already use for recreational purposes to learn both at school and at home. Thus, broadband-enabled technologies repurpose students’ time towards productive learning.
Universal broadband capability also creates an enormous market that digital learning resources may populate. The Obama Administration is placing significant emphasis on ensuring that digital space is used widely and creatively: at the National Rural Education Technology Summit in July 2010—where key government leaders affirmed their commitment to bringing broadband to rural America—Secretary of Education Arne Duncan introduced the Learning Registry, an interagency project to maximize the accessibility and use of online federal resources. The creation of the Learning Registry and similar projects will help to ensure that valuable resources flow generously and consistently through broadband-enabled learning pipelines.
Universally accessible and meaningfully used broadband can improve the quality of instruction students can receive in digitally-equipped classrooms anywhere in the country. Increasing equity and transparency through comprehensive broadband mapping and infrastructure-building may not appear to be the sexiest approach to social justice, but it may prove to have a surprisingly large impact.
Our end goal is to make universal broadband as consistently accessible and meaningfully used as telephone service. Today, the average American might have ready access to a phone, uses the device regularly and knowledgeably, and enjoys service that is comparable to what individuals across the country receive. As our communications capabilities continue to expand, we must begin to demand that same level of quality and equity for broadband service. With appropriate data infrastructure and a host of creative learning resources in place, we can begin to explore how advanced broadband capability can transform teaching and learning.

Undergraduate Council Vice President Bonnie Cao ’12 will serve as First Class Marshal, the Harvard Alumni Association announced Monday evening.
Cao, a Pforzheimer House resident and Government concentrator, will be joined by Lange P. Luntao ’12 of Kirkland House as Second Class Marshal.
Cao and Luntao are charged with working with the rest of the Senior Class Committee to represent the Class of 2012 in the HAA, plan Senior Week activities, and select the Class Day speaker.
For much of this year, the Marshals will be charged with planing and running events for the senior class.
Several of the newly-minted Marshals expressed the desire to find activities that would help foster unity among the members of the senior class.
Cao said she would like to act soon to plan first-semester events to jumpstart the year.
Marshal Athena Louise M. Lao ’12 of Cabot House said she hopes to institute service programs for the Class of 2012 as part of senior-year activities.
“I’d love to see a balance between the socially just and the socially crunk,” she said.
Luntao said he wants to suggest a variation of the Harvard Thinks Big program begun by Peter D. Davis ’12 specifically for the class of 2012, adding, “I want to be Pete Davis.”
“I don’t want to give away any of the surprises,” Luntao said.
Adams resident and Class Marshal Sanjay P. Misra ’12 also plans to secure a sponsorship from fast-food giant Taco Bell for the Class of 2012, citing the goal as a campaign point on which he ran.
Class Marshal Annie E. DeAngelo ’12 of Pforzheimer House said she’d also like to see more events that would bring seniors outdoors, into the Cambridge spring.
Additionally, Class Marshals are charged with the task of identifying the next Class Day speaker. Cao said her dream speaker would be either Jon Stewart or Stephen Colbert, while DeAngelo said that Andy Samberg and the creators of South Park—Trey Parker and Matt Stone—were among the suggestions she had received. Misra proposed Ellen DeGeneres, while Lao said her dream speaker would be Beyoncé Knowles.
Many of the Marshals said that a desire to give back to the community—both to their class and to the University at large—drove their decisions to apply to be a Class Marshal.
Misra said that being a Class Marshal was a way to stay connected to the people he admired.
“Every day you meet someone new who’s done amazing things,” he said. “You learn so much from them.”
DeAngelo said she has wanted to be a Class Marshal since her freshman year. “I love tradition, and I love the fact that Class Marshals have been around for a long time,” she said.
The Class Marshals were picked from a group of 63 seniors, which was narrowed down to a field of 16 before the final eight were chosen.
Nearly 1,000 seniors participated in the final round of voting, according to an email from HAA coordinator for student outreach Clint Ficula, and about a half an hour before polls closed, he said that only two votes separated the candidates for first and second Class Marshal.
Rounding out the list of class marshals are Oluwadamilola “Dammy” Akinfenwa ’12 of Cabot House, Matthew J. DaSilva ’12 of Adams House, and Barthalomew “B.A.” Sillah ’12 of Eliot House.

Approximately 30 students and other activists lined a sidewalk in the Kirkland House courtyard in silent protest of a pipeline proposed to run from Canada to the Gulf Coast as President Obama’s top presidential strategist David Axelrod made his way to an installment of the discussion series, “Conversations with Kirkland.”
Harvard Environmental Action Committee Chair Serena Y. Zhao ’12 said the group targeted Axelrod because the pipeline requires the President’s stamp of approval to move forward.
Zhao said that while the environmental impact of the pipeline is a serious concern, the protest was meant to be positive.
“We are trying to support the President in his ability to reject the pipeline. It’s a disaster in a number of ways,” Zhao said, citing threats to water security, farm security, and indigenous rights.
This is the second EAC protest of a “Conversations with Kirkland” talk in recent weeks. Two weeks ago, the EAC protested during a discussion with Obama’s campaign manager Jim Messina.
This time the protesters remained completely quiet.
“I think that the silence is really powerful,” Zhao said. “We are the mainstream. Not everyone wants to yell.”
As Axelrod entered Kirkland Courtyard, EAC member Collin A. Rees ’12 walked up to Axelrod and asked him, “How do you and the President plan to address flagging voter enthusiasm among the environmental base due to the pipeline issue?”
After quietly responding to Rees, Axelrod briefly addressed the protesters.
“I appreciate you guys being here and your commitment,” Axelrod said. “You may be silent, but you’re being heard.”
EAC Treasurer Kyle B. Flanagan ’11-12 said that many of the protesters had supported Obama when he first ran for President because of his stance on environmental issues.
“We’d like him to continue his commitment to the environment,” Flanagan said.
Zhao said a major motivation for the protest was to let the Obama administration know that approving the pipeline would disappoint his liberal voter base.

During the “Missile Gap” of the 1950s and 1960s, the United States drastically overestimated the number of Soviet missiles, according to 189 documents recently released by the CIA and discussed by former CIA agents and historians on Monday at the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston.
The declassified documents “showed the Soviets didn’t really have an advantage,” Chief of the CIA’s Historical Collections Division Bruce S. Barkan said. During the Missile Gap period, there was a growing perception in the U.S. that the Soviet Union had hundreds of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).
But a declassified document from Sept. 21, 1961—part of a larger set of newly released material called the Missile Gap Report—debunked this theory, providing evidence that the Soviets only had four ICBMs.
Former CIA agent John J. Bird coauthored the report and describes it as “the end of the Missile Gap.”
The study of the Missile Gap period is especially relevant because it relates to today’s situation in Iraq, North Korea, and Iran, said historian and author Fred Kaplan and Timothy Naftali, director of the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum and a former Harvard student.
During the forum, there were several speakers ranging from historians to former CIA agents.
The panels and talks continued for about five hours. During the closing forum, the four speakers discussed the history and the importance of the Missile Gap.
Media Spokesperson for the CIA Office of Public Affairs Preston B. Golson ’02 said he thought that the forum was fascinating and representative.
“These sort of CIA classifications are all about key national security questions that affected history,” Golson said.
In 1956, the U.S. mistakenly believed that there was a bomber gap where the Soviets had gained an advantage in deploying bomber aircraft, largely due to a 1955 air show where the Soviets flew bombers in a loop. After the CIA discredited this, the bomber gap concept transformed in 1957 into the concept of a missile gap.
“Psychologically, we had fallen behind,” Kaplan said. He added that the U.S. also thought that 1961 would be a year of maximum danger when the Soviets would launch a surprise attack.
Simultaneously, Soviet spies in the U.S. were feeding information to the USSR about U.S. missile fears.
But President Eisenhower called for aerial reconnaissance and imaging satellites such as the Corona Satellite, tools which eventually helped the U.S. realize that the Soviets were bluffing.
The CIA’s Historical Collections Division is responsible for declassifying historical documents—often holding forums afterwards to explain the documents’ significance to the public.
“We declassify as much as possible when we can,” Barkan said. “It adds to the body of knowledge and researchers get new information.”
But national security prevents some documents from being declassified, Barkan said.
The “number one concern is we still want to protect national security,” Barkan said. “Subject matter experts go through info using guidelines and see what can be released.”

President of the National Bank of Poland and former Prime Minister of Poland Marek M. Belka, speaking at the Minda de Gunzburg Center for European Studies Monday, called for a more centralized European Union that he said would ameliorate the continent’s current economic problems.
“In order to have a single economy, you have to have solid institutions that have the attributes of a state,” said Belka, who also served as the nation’s finance minister in 1997.
Belka said that the central problem facing the EU today is that it does not have an effective way to guarantee its debt. According to Belka, without a binding structure, it is unclear which country’s taxpayers will pay the debt, effectively leaving the EU without a budget.
Belka also noted that the advent of the euro led to a temporary economic boom in the poorer nations in the Union, which engendered high inflation rates.
During the boom, the poorer countries in the EU invested in industries such as construction and real estate, leaving behind goods that could be exported. This change in economic strategy caused the poor countries to become less competitive, according to Belka.
“These changes caused the nations of the EU to diverge rather than converge,” said Belka.
Despite the failings of the EU, Belka maintained that the crisis was fundamentally due to poor bank management. “It’s not to say that without the euro, the European economy wouldn’t be in a crisis. Italy, Portugal and Greece would still have currency crises.”
According to Belka, the failings of the euro exacerbated the individual crises in select European countries.
Belka outlined three possible solutions for the EU to emerge from the financial crisis, favoring the approach he deemed “muddling through.”
In order to “muddle through,” as Belka put it, the EU needs to put pressure on the countries that are suffering economically in order to force them to raise to the ranks of the other countries in the eurozone.
“Let the Greeks make some sacrifices,” Belka said.
Belka rejected the possibility that the EU may let Greece default on its debt. “Everybody in Europe is afraid of contagion,” said Belka, noting that many fear that Portugal may be the next nation in the Union to face a severe economic crisis.
The third possibility that Belka suggested was that the EU could monetize the debt.
“Inflation is the best way to get rid of the debt,” he said.
But Belka said he thought this was not a feasible option, since such high levels of inflation might cause Germany to leave the EU, as it might not want to carry the burden for the rest of the union.
“[Belka’s talk] was extremely topical and had special insights on the global financial crisis,” said Executive Director of CES Trisha Craig.
Belka’s lecture was part of the August Zaleski series at CES and was co-sponsered by the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies and the Harvard Club of Poland.

When Sandeep Das first left his home country, India, in 1991 to perform with steel drum bands in Trinidad, he said he had never even heard of the name “Yo-Yo Ma.”
“That’s how sheltered I was,” he said.
Now, as a tabla player for the Silk Road Ensemble, Das has not only come to know its director, the world-renowned cellist Yo-Yo Ma '76, but has also expanded his world view.
“I came from India, but now I belong to the world,” he said.
And just before noon on Monday, the Silk Road Ensemble presented a 15-minute “flash” performance at the Harvard Business School’s Spangler Center.
The Silk Road Ensemble—a collective of musicians from nearly 20 countries around the world—is in residence at Harvard from Sept. 22 to Sept. 28. The ensemble is a part of the Silk Road Project, a non-profit founded by Ma in 1998. The organization promotes collaboration, innovation, and learning through the arts with a vision of connecting the world’s neighborhoods by bringing together artists and audiences around the globe.
“Whenever we have a chance to bring together these artists from their many home countries, we use our time to the fullest, and this week will be no exception,” said Laura Freid, chief executive officer and executive director of the Silk Road Project.
In addition to presenting free performances, the project engages in cross-cultural exchanges and residencies, leads workshops for students, and partners with prominent cultural institutions to create educational programs and materials.
Although Communications Manager Heidi Koelz said the flash performance was “kept on the down-low,” the Spangler Center was filled with an excited audience of about a hundred people snapping pictures of the group and nodding their heads to the music.
Reflecting the diversity of the artists, the ensemble featured international instruments such as the tabla, a percussion from India, and the shakuhachi, a Japanese end-blown flute, as well as cellos and a viola.
The artists put on an enthusiastic performance, humming and whistling to the tunes, shaking the tambourines, and inviting a young audience member on stage to join in on the musical festivity.
“This is not a performance, but a conversation,” cellist Mike Block said. “We want to use art as a medium to improve people’s cultural life.”
According to Ma, the ensemble decided to perform at the Business School to explore possibilities for business and the arts to intersect in the emerging field of cultural entrepreneurship.
“Sounds are the tip of the iceberg. We want to explore what’s behind the iceberg,” Ma said. He added that there are three engines—political, economic, and cultural—that drive what he called the fulfillment of the world. He said the organization hopes to pursue the cultural engine to respond to the needs of society and to create value and meaning in peoples’ lives.
“Value is surely measurable in terms of sound, but it’s all the other conversations that happen in between that matter the most,” Ma said. “Music making is character development.”

The results of a recent physics experiment at the European Organization for Nuclear Research may pose the most direct challenge to Albert Einstein’s theory of relativity since its inception, holding the fate of modern physics in the balance.
Last Thursday, the OPERA (Oscillation Project with Emulsion-tRacking Apparatus) experiment revealed the discovery of neutrinos, neutral subatomic particles, measured at speeds faster than the speed of light.
The scientists emitted a beam of approximately 15,000 neutrinos 454 miles underground, and according to the team’s measurements, the beam went 60 nanoseconds faster than the speed of light.
The discovery conflicts with the premises of Einstein’s theory of relativity, which suggests that no object can move faster than the speed of light in a vacuum. The calculated difference of a few billionths of a second could thus have startling implications on developments in physics, potentially even allowing for previously forbidden possibilities such as time travel.
Irwin I. Shapiro, a Harvard physics professor, points out the careful scrutiny needed when reviewing these results.
“I would have to know a lot more about how the team measured the distance between its two sites, especially the geodetic connections between the surface and the underground sites, before I would even begin to take this claim seriously,” he said.
Indeed, the results have been met with great skepticism in the scientific community, with many physicists pointing out the myriad potential sources of error. Among them is the historically well-known difficulty of measuring the speed of neutrinos due to the weakness of their interactions.
Harvard Professor of Physics Emeritus Gerald Holton also suggests that the reason for the small difference might lie with the original accepted value of the speed of light.
“The new experiments compare themselves with the old, internationally accepted value of the speed of light ‘c,’” Holton said. “But it is little known outside the profession that the international agreement of the speed of light was not the result of a specific experiment [but] rather a decision of an international body.”
Despite its significant ramifications, the acceptance of the experiment’s results may not completely undercut Einstein’s theories in their entirety.
“It’s not about disproving the theory, but rather looking into its scope.” said physics professor Lisa J. Randall ’84. According to Randall, Einstein’s theory may be valid in certain contexts but built on assumptions that have not been completely confirmed.
“The question is whether it breaks down under different parameters and conditions,” she added.
In any case, the physics community seems to have reached a consensus that much further testing and experimentation lies ahead before Einstein’s theories will be debunked.

Dining hall workers voted in a new five-year contract with the University on Monday night, after discord regarding workers at Harvard Business School caused the union to delay the contract vote from last Monday for fear that the workers would vote it down.
The tentative contract guarantees, among other things, a 2.73 percent annual wage increase for workers and the creation of a joint committee of University staff and union members to monitor workplace conditions in dining halls.
Both the University and UNITE HERE! Local 26, the union that represents dining hall workers on campus, were pleased with the contract.
But the vote was delayed because union members became angry that nine HBS dining hall workers were not receiving the same benefits as every other University dining hall worker.
The affected workers, all of whom have been employees in Harvard dining halls for over 30 years, said that they would vote down the contract until their issue was resolved, and many of the other dining hall workers rallied behind them.
Local 26 immediately began negotiations with Restaurant Associates, the contractor which employs Business School dining hall workers.
“They agreed to give the nine affected workers the same benefits as every other worker at Harvard,” said Local 26 President Brian Lang. “We were very pleased.”
Neither Restaurant Associates nor HBS could be reached for comment.
Lang said that after workers felt the HBS issue was resolved, they were very enthusiastic about the new contract, with 87 percent of dining hall workers voting to confirm it.
“We think that this is a great contract,” Lang said. “The membership clearly sees it that way.”
George Sabatino, one of the nine affected workers who previously said he would not vote for the contract until his issue was resolved, said that he was grateful for the support of his “union brothers and sisters.”
“For everyone to come together to get more rights for us [the nine workers], it’s really touching,” he said. “I’m so glad the University finally respected us long-time employees.”
He added that he voted to confirm the contract.
“I’m ecstatic about the new contract—this has been a long struggle,” Sabatino said. “We finally got the contract we deserve.”
Lang said that the most important point of the contract is the joint committee, which he feels will improve working conditions for dining hall workers. The committee will also focus on developing environmentally friendly dining practices.
“I think that what’s most important is the fact that we have successfully addressed the issue of sustainable foods and sustainable jobs through the best practices committee,” Lang said. “The fact that there are real decision makers at Harvard on this committee who will be working with us on a regular basis is ground-breaking.”
Adams House Chief Steward Edward B. Childs, a member of the Local 26 bargaining committee, said that he thinks the contract is beneficial for dining hall workers.
“I think it’s a good contract,” Childs said. “I think it’s got some really important steps.”
Lang agreed with Childs, saying that the contract is a great “first step” for University-union relations.
“We’re eager to start the work of the implementation of these changes,” Lang said. “We look forward to working with Harvard.”

Panelists characterized Sultan Mohamed Sa’ad Abubakar as an Islamic leader looking to ameliorate religious tensions in Nigeria in a discussion on Monday night.
The panel, which focused on Islam’s influence in Nigeria, was held in preparation for Abubakar’s visit to the University, which is scheduled for Oct. 3.
Abubakar, who is also known as the Sultan of Sokoto, is the spiritual leader of the Muslim population in Nigeria and is a member of a dynasty more than 200 years old.
Abubakar is on a mission to encourage interfaith dialog and cultivate a stronger national identity for Nigeria, according to panelist Jacob Olupona, who is a professor of African religious traditions at the Harvard Divinity School.
Nigeria has the sixth largest Muslim population in the world. Islam is more prevalent in the north, and Christianity in the south, Hauwa Ibrahim, a visiting lecturer on women’s studies and Islamic law at the Divinity School, noted.
Historically, there have been tensions between the two faiths, exacerbated by media coverage of conflicts in surrounding regions, said M. Sani Umar, a professor of religion at Northwestern University. But Umar also said that the relationship between the two religious groups has improved in recent decades.
“The Sultan firmly believes that Muslim-Christian relations can be cultivated,” Olupona said.
Panelists were optimistic about Abubakar’s goal of religious cohesion, noting that the religious leader has far-reaching importance.
“[He] is a leader with tremendous political, social, cultural, and religious influence, but with absolutely very little formal power in the sense that he can not enforce his decisions or impose his will,” Umar said.
Benjamin Soares, senior researcher at the African Studies Centre at the University of Leiden, echoed these sentiments, noting that Abubakar’s power comes from the significant role that religion plays in Nigeria.
“Anyone who knows Nigeria will tell you about the importance of religion in the cultural and public spheres. Nigerians are exuberant people and exuberant in the practice of their religion,” Soares said.
According to the panel, the Sultan represents what they believe to be the core values of Islam: human dignity, respect, and tolerance of other faiths.
“He’s one of the largest and most influential Islamic leaders in the world. He leads one of the largest Muslim segments and he’s a very cultural and educated man with a progressive agenda for Nigeria. This is an aspect of contemporary Islam that cannot be ignored,” said Susan Abraham, associate director of the Center for the Study of World Religions.
The Sultan’s upcoming visit is not only of interest to students at the University, but also to the Nigerian community.
“One of the other draws of him coming to Harvard is that Boston has a significant Nigerian population. There is a significant Nigerian population that we are hoping to attract to the event on Monday,” Abraham said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week at the Broadway T station in South Boston, a “blonde lady with glasses” smiled and shook hands with dozens of commuters. Most South Boston residents did not know who she was, but the event marked the beginning of Harvard Law School Professor Elizabeth Warren’s campaign for the U.S. Senate and the beginning of her battle to win the votes of South Boston.
“That’s the first time I had seen her and I didn’t know who she was,” Southie resident Paul Llewellyn said.
South Boston, a long-time stronghold of conservative Democrats, will likely be a key battle ground in the upcoming 2012 Senate race between incumbent Republican Scott Brown and Warren, the undisputed Democratic front runner.
In the special election following the death of long-time senator Edward M. Kennedy ’54-56, South Boston voted heavily Republican, helping propel Brown to victory. About 30 percent of residents in Boston voted for Brown, but in South Boston the number was closer to 56 percent.
Brown’s upset win against Attorney General Martha Coakley was in large part attributed to his ability to carry out an aggressive campaign heavy on retail politics. During the election, Brown barnstormed across the state in his pick-up truck, effectively casting himself as an ordinary man with the common touch necessary to understand the problems of regular people. That message resonated particularly well among the people of South Boston, and if she wants to win in November, Warren will have to win back those votes.
But to do that, Warren faces many challenges. In South Boston, Warren is still an unknown, and many of its residents say they are skeptical of her Harvard background.
When asked if they would vote for her, neighborhood residents expressed mixed feelings, with many saying they did not have sufficient knowledge of the candidate.
Matt Sances, a gruff military veteran who voted for Brown in 2010, came to the door in a tight fitting black t-shirt and a military crew cut. A Marine Corps flag hangs from his house. Sances said he hadn’t heard about Warren, who launched her campaign a thirty minute walk from his house.
“I don’t know enough about her to be honest,” Sances said.
While Warren is a well-known figure within the national Democratic establishment, she does not have the same name recognition in local communities, including South Boston.
“All I know is that she’s from Oklahoma, and she’s a law professor at Harvard,” said Brendan Price, a native Southie, affecting a Boston Brahmin accent for the word Harvard. “They have a kind of elitist attitude, so I don’t think it helps that she’s from Oklahoma, and she teaches at Harvard. She needs to be a little more in touch with the local people.”
But Warren’s Harvard connection is far from a kiss of death in South Boston. One resident said that he thought being a Harvard professor might be a positive, raising the possibility that the Warren campaign could subtly spin Warren’s professorship in a positive light.
“She’s smarter than the average politician,” John Morris said. “She’s a smart cookie.”
In a recent video that became a viral hit on the internet, Warren spoke in favor of progressive tax rates by arguing that the social contract obligates people to share their wealth with their fellow citizens while mixing it with a folksy message of how the rich benefit from the state.
Warren follows in a long line of Harvard graduates and affiliates who have sought statewide and national office, and like many of those candidates Warren has so far played down her Cambridge ties and sought to portray herself as a regular, middle class American.
“Robert Frost said to John F. Kennedy: ‘be more Irish than Harvard,’” former Boston City Councillor Lawrence S. DiCara ’71 said. “Maybe she should be more grandmother than professor.”
Warren has emphasized that she is the daughter of a maintenance worker and that she grew up “on the ragged edge of the middle class,” a reference to her hardscrabble Oklahoma upbringing.
“On the one hand she’s a Harvard professor and clearly an advocate of government regulation, but on the other hand she does come from a working class background and claims that the regulations were for the middle class,” said David Luberoff, the executive director of the Rappaport Institute for Greater Boston at Harvard Kennedy School. “She has a potentially populist message that could conceptually resonate with the residents of a place like South Boston.”
Like most other Americans, the neighborhood’s residents said that the state of the economy and job-creation are at the top of their list of concerns going into the election, which Warren has worked hard to capitalize upon.
Bernie Ordway works at a barber shop and said that he has witnessed small businesses struggle in the difficult financial climate. In particular, insurance rates have become very costly, he said.
Kathleen, who works as a waitress and declined to give her last name, said that she has noticed a decrease in customers recently, and that her boyfriend, an iron worker, has struggled to find work.
Fears like these—and an ineffectual campaign by Coakley—allowed Brown to win what has long been a Democratic seat. According to Public Policy Polling, a Democratic polling firm, Warren currently leads Brown by two percentage points state-wide, leading 46 percent to Brown’s still strong 44 percent.
“I think [the people of South Boston] are enamored by that other clown in his barn coat and pick up truck,” South Boston resident Sean Connelly said, referring to Brown. “He buffaloed Southie in the last election.”
DiCara said that Brown has done an admirable job of making himself known in Boston neighborhoods, which will make him a tough candidate to defeat.
“That’s the sort of thing Ted Kennedy did. People felt they knew him really well even if they didn’t, and they get that feeling from Scott Brown,” DiCara said. “Scott Brown has extraordinary appeal to the common man.”
“If she really wants [to win], she’s got to get out on the streets and talk to people,” life-long South Boston resident Steve O’Brien said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Andrew J. Magliozzi ’05, a Quincy House tutor, is looking to   revolutionize the way students experience higher education through the   expansion of his non-profit website FinalsClub.org, which allows  students to share publicly class notes, outlines, and slides on the  site.
This year, Magliozzi expanded the site’s client base, creating new   branches at universities nationwide. Finalsclub.org is currently open to   the Ivies, Berkeley, Lock Haven, MIT, Stanford,  University of Texas,   and Wellesley.
“I really want it to become a sustainable project at every college   campus in the world,” Magliozzi explained. “We’re starting at a certain   group of schools that have motivated students, and I have some   connections at them. But we want to go everywhere.”
Magliozzi was inspired by the MIT Open Courseware project, which—like   FinalsClub.org—is a free publication that gives the general public   access to university course materials, including lecture videos. Since   its creation in 2003, the MIT Open Courseware project, which is run by   the university, has grown to include nearly every MIT course and has   garnered nearly 100 million visits.
While Magliozzi hopes to replicate this program’s success, his approach differs: finalsclub.org relies on the participation of students, not the administration.
Magliozzi  believes top-down models rely too heavily upon an  innovative  administrator, and therefore, are slow to spread. Rather, he  intends “to  rely on the creative capacity of students and do a bottom  up project  that will allow really anyone in the academic hierarchy to  create and  carry knowledge and share it freely with the world.”
As the bottom-up model relies on student initiative and  participation,  his goal in expanding the program has been to help  students see the  value of the resource, to see all that can be gained  from sharing.
But finalsclub.org’s  expansion has been slow going. This semester,  only Harvard and Berkeley  have course materials available on the  site—Harvard has course material  available for seven classes, Berkeley  for one.
Although the project’s adoption has been slow, Magliozzi remains hopeful.
“I  would say that my ultimate goal would be for a groundswell of  support  to overwhelm open courseware, and I suppose make it the default  at every  school everywhere. But that’s a big ambition.”

Our alumni tracker for the week again remains focused on Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05, who completed Mission: Impossible on Sunday, when he led Buffalo to victory over New England for the first time in eight years.
The Harvard alum, who is currently leading in ESPN.com’s poll for AFC East Player of the week, threw for a season-high 369 yards, completing 27-of-40 throws with two touchdown passes. With the help of running back Fred Jackson and a couple of key interceptions by his defense, Fitzpatrick directed a come-from-behind win to give the Bills’ their first 3-0 record since 2008.
Buffalo hadn’t found a way to defeat New England since Fitzpatrick’s junior year at Harvard. However, with the Crimson grad leading the charge after falling behind, 21-0, the Bills stared down Tom Brady and his Patriots with full confidence, forcing four turnovers and 93 penalty yards.
In the post-game press conference, when asked what felt better, beating the Pats or beating Yale, Fitzpatrick responded the former.
“You know, I never lost to Yale, so this one was probably sweeter.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker’s fifth recruiting class with the Crimson is beginning to fill up.
Mike Hall, a 6'10 senior at Woodward Academy (Ga.) committed to Harvard this evening, choosing Amaker’s squad over offers from George Mason and Penn—which he stated were his second and third choices, respectively.
Hall, rated an 89 by ESPN and a member of the Rivals.com Top 150, was one of eight highly-touted high school prospects to visit Harvard this past weekend.
“Just the experience I had this weekend [pushed me over the edge],” said Hall, who noted that he had arrived in Cambridge without expecting to make a decision in the near future. “I really enjoyed my experience up there. It just felt like the right fit for me.”
“Also, [it was] the fact that I had a really good relationship with Coach Amaker,” added Hall, who joins Evan Cummins of Northfield Mount Hermon (Mass.) as the second member of the future class of 2016. “He showed me some film of his style of play. It’s great, and it really seems like a great fit for me.”
Hall’s announcement has already sent waves throughout the national media, which has been keeping close tabs on Harvard’s recruitment in recent days.
“He is long and athletic, and uses both effectively on the defensive end,” wrote Jeff Borzello, a college basketball writer at CBSSports.com, who said that Hall has the potential to be a “stud” in the Ancient Eight. “He needs to add weight and get tougher, but he’s not afraid to mix it up on the glass.”
“IF the light goes on Mike Hall is going to be a problem for the Ivy League,” tweeted ESPN analyst Dave Telep. “Harvard scores prime commitment from him tonite.”
In addition to bolstering the Crimson’s future frontcourt, Hall’s commitment also marks another disappointment for Harvard’s Ivy League rival Penn. The Quakers, whose four returning frontcourt players combined for just eight starts this past season, were high on the talented big.
“Penn was, as well, one of the schools I was really considering pretty hard,” Hall said.
But just one day after leaving Cambridge, Hall placed a phone call to an “excited” Amaker to announce his decision.
“I’m not really sure how I’m celebrating yet,” Hall said. “I’m just excited.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Looking to prove that it has what it takes to be one of the country’s top teams, the Harvard sailing team entered the third week of its fall schedule still searching for its first top finish. The practice that the sailors put in the last couple of weeks paid off, as the Crimson finally grabbed its first regatta win of the season.
The co-ed squad claimed first place overall at the Professor Steadman Hood Trophy intersectional regatta, hosted by Tufts.
Harvard also sent out a contingent from the women’s squad to compete at the Women’s Regis Bowl at nearby Boston University, where the Crimson finished in 13th place on the weekend.
“It was a good first win of the season for us,” co-captain Brendan Kopp said. “We know that we’re always going to be competing in competitive regattas, but we’re always aiming to be in the top five, or even [among] the top three schools out there. It’s nice to win an event, but our goal for each regatta is to be consistently at the top.”
STEADMAN HOOD TROPHY
Facing weather conditions that limited each of the two divisions to just four races—and preventing the B-division from completing any races on Sunday—the Harvard co-ed squad put together a dominant performance to claim its first overall victory this season after coming in ninth place last weekend.
“We like to say that the weather at Mystic Lake is always ‘mystical,’” Kopp joked. “Lucky for us, I’ve sailed here a couple times before, and [sophomore] Sarah [Pierson] has too. It’s nice to be in the lead in these events, especially when we can’t finish the regatta because of weather.”
Despite the lack of wind on the water, Kopp and Pierson cruised to first place in the A-Division with a pair of first- and second-place finishes, good for a season-low six points, 22 points ahead of second-place Washington College.
Not to be outdone, the B-division pair of seniors Emily Lambert and Alex Jumper also placed near the top of the regatta, coming in fourth place out of the 21-team field.
The duo sailed to one second-place finish out of its four races, racking up 25 points.
“All of the practice definitely paid off,” Kopp said. “We’re racing in boats that we weren’t used to coming into the season, but now we’re comfortable with them and with each other, and that’s been a key to our success.”
WOMEN’S REGIS BOWL
The weather was not much better on the Charles River, as the 16 teams had to contend with fluky and unpredictable breezes all throughout the weekend of racing. Overall, the young Crimson women’s squad finished in 13th place on the weekend.
“There is a lot of pressure on our women’s team this year,” Kopp said, “especially since Alex [Jumper] and Emily [Lambert], their A-division combo that did so well last year, are now racing for the co-ed squad.”
Competing for the first time in A-Division this season, sophomore Caitlin Watson and senior Caroline Lowe finished the weekend with 64 points, good for ninth place.
“We have some big shoes to fill with Emily and Alex now competing with the co-eds,” Watson said. “But we’re up to the challenge, and we’re always ready to race and do our best against the rest.”
In the B-division, sophomore Isabel Ruane competed for the first time with freshman Kendra Norton. The duo combined for 87 points to claim 13th place in its division.
With the first month of sailing down in the books, Harvard is once again showing why it has one of the top sailing programs in the nation.
The co-ed squad is currently ranked third in the country only behind Ivy League rival Yale and annual powerhouse Boston College. The women’s team, after trading the talents of Jumper and Lambert to the co-eds, is still in the top ten, ranked eighth in the nation.
“We’ve still got the rest of the season to look forward to, so we’re not going to settle for just one regatta win,” Kopp said. “We know we’re one of the best, and we prove it week in week out. All that’s left for us to do is to keep doing what we’re doing: winning.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After 10 years of volleyball and a season on the Radcliffe heavyweight squad’s second varsity boat, Anne Carroll (“AC,” for short) Ingersoll found the hardest part of her athletic career was taking a break.
On the volleyball court, Ingersoll had been a dominating presence. As a freshman on the Harvard women’s volleyball team, she started all 25 games, culminating in an Ivy League Rookie of the Year award and an All-Ivy honorable mention.
By her junior year, Ingersoll was co-captain of the squad and had nabbed Academic All-Ivy League accolades.
So when her play started faltering during summer training before her senior season, she knew something was wrong.
“For the first few weeks [of summer training], I felt awesome—I was swinging hard and feeling great,” the California native said. “But as the months went on, I lost a lot of power and was just in a ton of pain. I couldn’t get a serve over the net.”
It quickly became clear to Ingersoll that, not only was something wrong, but that she would be unable to make it through her senior season with the pain.
Turns out, the outside hitter had a large tear in her labrum—the padding between the ball and socket of her shoulder—in addition to a small tear in her rotator cuff.
Ingersoll soon learned that the injury could only be repaired surgically.
“I got to the point where I had to decide to fix it and take time off, or let it be,” Ingersoll said. “The only option really for me was to get it fixed.”
Which is why the senior is now at home in California taking a semester off and undergoing rehabilitation and physical therapy, one month post-operation rather than fresh off her first Ivy League match with the Crimson.
For four months, Ingersoll will be unable to use her right arm for activities ranging from lifting, to pushing, to pulling. A recent victory was regaining the ability to type with two hands.
But the most difficult part is not the rehab, she said, but missing her senior season, missing her team, and missing the sport she has loved for so long.
“It’s so hard,” Ingersoll said. “This was going to be my senior season. [Christine] Wu, Sandra Lynne [Fryhofer], and I had been looking forward to this season since we were freshmen.”
The three—Wu, Fryhofer, and Ingersoll—had even dubbed themselves “The Golden Trio,” with plans to reign over the Ivy League during the 2011 season.
“It’s tough to realize that it’s ‘they’ rather than ‘we’ this season,” Ingersoll said.
But despite the absence of its powerful hitter and leader, the Harvard women’s volleyball team has responded in a way that has and does make Ingersoll proud. With an early 7-4 record, the squad is anything but down and out.
So far this season, even with a young team featuring nine underclassmen, the Crimson has shut out five opponents and has been on the winning end of two tight, five-set matches.
“AC had a huge presence on and off the court … and had a character that draws people to her,” Wu said. “Obviously we miss her, and we feel like we have a huge gap that we need to fill, but I think our team has done a great job of managing that hole and moving forward.”
“I am super proud of [the team],” Ingersoll said. “They’re all playing so awesome … I think [the team] we have is a really good combination of upperclassmen who know the drill and of underclassmen who are primed and ready to be taught.”
Sophomore Erin Cooney has stepped into Ingersoll’s old position and has posted impressive numbers so far this season–86 kills, 16 digs, and 25 blocks–and garnered all-tournament honors at the Harvard Invitational.
Though the time it takes for Ingersoll to fully recover is unknown at this point, she plans on returning in the spring to participate in her second season on the Radcliffe heavyweight crew squad.
“The process of being able to row again is one that I’m really excited about … and has given me perspective during this semester when I’ve been out of commission,” Ingersoll said. “Rowing is something that’s been keeping me going and patient during rehab because I have a goal in mind.”
Despite the injury, the time off, and the rehabilitation, Ingersoll still is a part of her team, even if from several thousand miles away. She watches the live statistics stream during every match, keeps up with every player, both old and young, and feels both the victories and defeats that the squad experiences.
“I have total faith in my team,” Ingersoll said. “I’m glad that I get to be somewhat connected … I’m really not going to let [my team] go.”
“We know that AC is still 100 percent behind us,” Wu added. “She is still very much a part of our team and wouldn’t want us to take our eyes off the prize.”
So whether at the Malkin Athletic Center or three thousand miles away with her shoulder in a sling, a leader is always a leader.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The situation was strikingly similar to last fall when an early-season injury sidelined the starting quarterback, Andrew Hatch ’09-’11, and then-sophomore Colton Chapple was called on to lead the Harvard football team.
This time, it was senior Collier Winters who sustained a minor hamstring injury in the opener against Holy Cross, prompting Crimson coach Tim Murphy to scratch his starter early last week and prepare Chapple for the Ivy League opener against Brown.
In Chapple’s debut last season, Harvard’s offense relied heavily on the Gino Gordon ’10-led run game, and Chapple completed only six passes for 82 yards and one touchdown in a 35-10 road victory over Lafayette.
But in his first start of 2011, Chapple took the reins of the Crimson’s offense, completing 15-of-26 passes for 207 yards, two touchdowns, and only one interception.
Intermittent heavy showers and steady mist throughout the game did not hinder Chapple’s effectiveness, as the junior quarterback averaged eight yards per pass play.
A successful passing game wasn’t Chapple’s only highlight on Friday night—he also showed his athleticism and offensive versatility in a pivotal situation.
On fourth and three on the Brown six-yard line, the Crimson set up for a field goal with Chapple holding the ball.
But it was a fake, and Chapple rushed five yards for a crucial first down, setting up junior running back Treavor Scales’ one-yard touchdown run on the next play.
“We practiced it all week,” said Chapple about the trick play. “Coach [Tony] Reno, our special teams coach, scouted [the Bears] very well, and they were in the right defense for us to exploit them.”
But Chapple didn’t escape the contest without some close calls.
As the first quarter wound down, Brown defensive back Matt Billeci intercepted Chapple’s pass that sailed through the intended receiver’s hands on the first play of Harvard’s drive.
But the Bears were hit with a roughing-the-passer penalty, and the Crimson kept the ball, setting the stage for a methodical march downfield.
After Chapple connected with senior wideout Alex Sarkisian and Scales ran for 25-yards, sophomore tight end Cameron Brate hauled in a 20-yard pass in the end zone to put the Crimson up 14-0, capping off an impressive 80-yard drive.
In the fourth quarter, with Brown down by only a touchdown, Chapple stepped up, orchestrating an eight-play, 95-yard drive ending in a 56-yard touchdown throw to senior receiver Adam Chrissis.
What Chapple sees as the main difference between the similar situation he faced last season and this weekend’s contest was his level of preparation.
“Last year I kind of got caught off guard [being called on to start in the third game of the season], and I didn’t have the grasp on the offense that I do now,” Chapple said. “[This year] I came into the season expecting to play, expecting to contribute. I feel like I was more prepared in that sense, and more ready to play college football than I was last year.”
In the 2010 campaign, the sophomore made three starts while Hatch and Winters recovered from injuries.
With Winters nursing his hamstring, the team is not sure who will be running the offense on Saturday at Lafayette, a non-conference game. Though Winters has been making progress, the team will likely focus on keeping him healthy instead of risking injury in a game that doesn’t appear on the Crimson’s Ivy record.
“There’s a chance [Winters] might play, but I wouldn’t be surprised if Colton starts the game on Saturday,” Brate said.
If Harvard needs Chapple on Saturday, he will be ready.
“Right now, I’m still going with the mindset that if Collier can’t go I’m going to be the guy and do whatever it takes to get the win against Lafayette,” Chapple said.
But regardless of who is taking the snaps on Saturday, for Chapple, starting in a home night game against an Ivy League rival and getting the win was a memorable experience.
“I grew up in Georgia dreaming about these games,” Chapple said. “It almost had a high school feel to it, being at night under the lights. … To look up in the stands and see 20,000 people, it’s a great opportunity, and it’s a great stage.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After one of the most important weekends in Harvard men’s basketball history, the dominoes continue to fall in the Crimson's favor.
Following his official visit to Cambridge a few days ago, Siyani Chambers, a 5’11, 160-lb point guard out of Hopkins High School (Minn.) committed to Harvard yesterday—the same day that fellow visitor Mike Hall of Woodward Academy (Ga.) also gave his word to Crimson coach Tommy Amaker.
“I just really liked the community and the players and the coaching staff and thought it was going to be a great fit for me,” said Chambers, rated a three-star recruit by Rivals.com and an 88 by ESPN.com.
Jeff Borzello of CBSSports.com told The Crimson last week that Chambers is a “lefty point guard, quick, good floor leader ... he knows how to move the ball, he’s getting better on his shot. I think he’s a really solid point guard, and he would be a good fit for Harvard. He could run the show for four years.”
Neal Nieves of C2CRecruiting.com tweeted, "No clue why more schools didn't offer Chambers. Kid is going to be a very good point guard for Harvard. ... When Harvard is making it's elite 8 run in 4 years and Chambers is running things, then they will say damn I should have offered him."
Chambers said his final two schools were Harvard and the University of California, Davis.
“Now the pressure’s off about trying to find a college to go to, and I can just worry about playing basketball,” he said.
He joins the 6'10 Hall and Evan Cummins of Northfield Mount Hermon (Mass.) in Amaker's latest recruiting class.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just over three weeks into their fall seasons, several Harvard varsity athletic teams have had strong starts to their years. Here is a look at the Crimson’s five best fall teams and their most notable achievements thus far.
5. Football 
The Crimson rebounded from a 30-22 loss at Holy Cross with an impressive 24-7 victory over Brown last Friday night. Junior back-up quarterback Colton Chapple threw for 207 yards and 2 touchdowns in the win. The team will look to improve its record on Oct. 1 at Lafayette, a team that beat Ivy-League favorite Penn handily two weeks ago.
4. Women’s Volleyball
Led by the strong defensive play of senior libero Christine Wu and the dominant offensive attack of freshman outside hitter Tara Maclean, Harvard sits on a 7-4 record. Just about midway through its season, the Crimson will continue Ivy League play on Friday at Princeton.
3. Women’s Tennis
In her first intercollegiate competition this year, junior Kristin Norton won championships in both the “A” flight singles and doubles brackets at the Harvard Fall Classic. The team shows promise, even without senior and last year’s captain Holly Cao. The Crimson will travel to California this weekend to compete in the Riviera/ITA Women’s All-American Championship.
2. Sailing
After finishing second at both the Harry Anderson Trophy and the FJ Invitational, the Crimson co-ed squad earned its first victory of the season at the Professor Stedman Hood Trophy last weekend. The team will compete in the Charles River Invitational on Sunday.
1. Women’s Golf
Harvard opened its season with team victories at both the Yale and Princeton Invitational tournaments. Freshman Tiffany Lim led the Crimson, winning the individual titles at The Course at Yale and Springdale Golf Club in New Jersey. The Crimson look to continue its success this weekend at the Nittany Lion Invitational at Penn State.

Cute Penguin is looking for a Gov 20 study buddy. Lonely Koala is feeling hungry during lecture. Winning Chipmunk hopes his CS50 classmates can suggest a good drink for late-night coding sessions.
Ignore the unusual names. These people are your classmates. Well, Klassmates with a K, that is.
These Harvard students and about 350 more are users of Klassmating, a smartphone app created by Abel Acuña '11.
The app, which launched at Harvard during the first week of classes this semester and is also available at several other schools, lets students chat anonymously with others in their classes. Acuña said that he hopes students in large lecture courses will use the app during and after class, perhaps to ask questions that they might not voice in person.
"We hope [the anonymity] will enhance interaction that otherwise wouldn’t happen in more transparent forms," Acuña said.
To promote the project, members of the Klassmating team distributed slips to students on the first day of class in several large courses at Harvard. The papers, resembling official course handouts with no logos or graphics, said, for example, "In an effort to enhance in-lecture participation and information sharing among students enrolled in Ec 10, we are piloting an in-lecture chat feature for use on smartphone devices," then provided instructions for downloading the app.
Thanks to an acquaintance in Korea who has partnered with Acuña on the project, the app is financed by a group of Korean investors who pay the salaries of six computer programmers, one graphic designer, and one business developer, who all work on the app in Seoul.
In keeping with the playful animal theme, the team has created new functions called "Zoo" and "Safari" since the initial launch. Zoo lets all users at one university communicate in a shared forum, and Safari aims to connect students from multiple schools based on common interests. For example, a Safari chat room will open up during the Harvard-Yale game to allow students from both schools to publicize parties and events happening that weekend.
Additionally, Acuña said that an internet-based version of Klassmating to complement the phone tool will be available in the next few weeks.
He is optimistic that Klassmating will grow in popularity at Harvard, pointing to the more than 1,000 students who already use it at Seoul National University, where his partner was a graduate student before taking time off to work full-time on Klassmating.
He said he hopes to increase overseas usage, first in English-speaking countries like the UK and Australia and later across the globe. Maybe soon we'll be seeing Cheeky Toad and Chipper Kangaroo complaining about their psets.

The Happiness Olympics kicked off Saturday night with what began as a series of structured water balloon face-offs and ended in wet, colorful chaos.
In  the first round of battle, the approximately 30 participants—divided into several small  teams—played a dodgeball-style game of avoiding each others' watery  missiles in the dark. Next, participants used two giant slingshots to  hurl balloons at each other. Then, with hundreds of leftover balloons and multiple water guns, the competition dissolved into a  free-for-all.
About an hour after the fighting began, the soaked participants were rewarded for their efforts: since the turnout was lower than expected,  each player received a pizza of their own to take home. We caught up with some of the participants and organizers after the event  to talk about the watery fun.

Crowds  of eager tourists walk through the Yard each day, led by peppy guides  who promise to give them the lowdown on all things Harvard. And while  there are a ton of quirky facts about Harvard (a room designed solely  for use by the ghost of a former student, anybody?), some of the  information on those tours is highly embellished or just plain  incorrect. Here are the top five false facts the tour guides will tell  you.
1. It is tradition for students to rub the foot of the John Harvard statue for luck before an exam or first date. On the contrary, one of the first lessons incoming freshmen learn is to  never touch that shiny bronze foot, especially without a vat of hand  sanitizer to use afterwards. Yes, tourists may line up to get their  hands on it for luck (or for admissions success), but it's highly  unlikely you'll see a Harvard student doing the same.
2. Freshmen can petition for co-ed suites. As well as rightly informing you that Harvard’s "Great Experiment" with co-educational housing began in 1970, with Straus Hall the last to go co-ed in 1980, a least  one tour guide also informs visitors that if freshmen ask nicely, they  can reorganize suites into mixed-gender configurations. In fact, gender-neutral housing is available only to upperclassmen in some houses, and Resident Dean of Elm Yard Sue Brown confirmed that freshmen don't have this option.
3. Harry  Elkins Widener's mother stipulated in her donation funding a library in  her son's memory that all students must take a swim test in order to  graduate from Harvard. This falsehood stems from Widener's true unfortunate fate aboard the  Titanic and his mother's supposed belief that had he known how to swim,  he would have survived. Tour guides say that his grieving mother  demanded that every graduating student pass a swim test. While there was  a swim test in place for decades, it did not actually have anything to  do with the Widener family.
 
4. Lamont hands out deodorant to students during reading period. An unusual claim and one that students probably wish was true, one tour  guide claimed that the library provides deodorant for the students who  ditch their dorms to become tenants there during reading period.  Although it's true that some students bring their sleeping bags to camp  out in the reading room, students are in fact responsible for their own  personal hygiene during their stay. 
 
5. JFK's freshman room got "shafted" when elevators were installed in Weld Hall. Due to renovations to the building, Weld 32 indeed no longer exists in  the same location that it did when President John F. Kennedy '40 lived  there. However, the elevator shaft does not cut through that room.

Often  considered the biggest day of your life, a wedding involves  many choices: bridesmaid dress colors, guest lists, and very  importantly, a venue. Members of the Harvard community have an option  open only to current and former employees and students—Memorial Church.Aside  from the church's aesthetic appeal, nostalgia for their alma mater  calls many couples back to campus for their big day. "We have lots of  couples who met at Harvard and for this reason feel they should be  married there," Richard D. Campbell, sexton at Memorial Church, said. 
 
The  waiting list must be years long though, right? Wrong. Campbell said  that the church, which hosts about 100 weddings per year, actually has "very little to no wait."
 
But  surely the price tag is greater than the GNP of a small country? Wrong  again. With the basic rental price of Appleton Chapel beginning at $400,  the affordability is a draw for many couples, including Graduate School  of Education alumna Maglen K. Epstein and current graduate student  Louis K. Epstein, who were married there last week. "We were looking for  somewhere local and convenient to where we were having our reception,"  Maglen Epstein said, "and the price was very affordable compared to  other venues in the area."
 
Rates go up considerably after graduation, so if you're considering getting hitched, go ahead and do it now.

In the Mather dorm room where Leah V. Schecter '13 lives, the walls are  covered in color. Pages torn from MFA calendars bring images of famous  works to the room. Schecter's own paintings hang alongside them.
If this sounds like your room, congratulations. If your walls are considerably more bare, Schecter has the event for you.
As  co-president of the Harvard College Art Society, she is helping to run a  studio party this Friday where attendees can craft their own dorm  decorations.The program was suggested by freshmen who recently signed up for the  club, which is also known as hART. From 7 to 9 p.m. on Friday,  participants will have the chance to use the supplies in the Adams Art  Space, a converted squash court which now houses an assortment of  paints, chalks, papers, brushes, and more. Schecter said that while hART  members will be on hand to answer questions, any students can attend  and can create any projects they imagine. To provide inspiration, hART  members made sample projects for the event.
This is one Friday night that could bring some color to the rest of your year. "There definitely should  be extracurricular opportunities for art," said Schecter.
