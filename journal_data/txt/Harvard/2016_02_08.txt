After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In eleventh grade, there was a new girl in my school. She came from the West Coast, landed in close-to-somewhere-but-really-nowhere New Jersey, and looked straight punk with the eyeliner to match. I thought I was hard because I had cut the bubblegum shit a year ago and listened to "Ready to Die" while trig-ing my way through Intro to BC. She was probably looking for the other punk kids at school because there’s always a crew and they’re always “the best people you will ever meet” until you realize Asianized New Jersey is very different from the West Coast or anything in the movies (i.e. no punk kids). When we were both stuck friendless in gym class, I was bland as chewed gum and she’d already convinced everyone she was too cool to talk. It would have been a perfect setup for a lesbian movie (think "Foxfire"), but in real life, the unattached one, me, was straight; the queer one, she, had a steady boyfriend; and everyone was too busy to get seduced.
Before I was in love with Toni Morrison, I was in love with this one phrase everyone associates with her, her style, her characters, her plots, her thinking: dangerous. No. Not just dangerous. Dangerously free. As in can’t be contained, as in dying young, as in nothing to lose. I think I had an idea of what “dangerously free” would look like, and it always involved this raw, breathless, windswept intensity that could only be described as tragically beautiful. Like getting so skinny from meth you could drum your ribs like a guitar. Like laughing, but not because it’s funny. Like cigarette smoke and the skin beneath your knee. I was thinking about a girl, bound by no one, nowhere, nothing but her body; a girl so broken that norms don’t matter; a girl, from no place, going nowhere. It all seemed like straight poetry.
The new girl? I wasn’t sure if she fit that description,—the dangerously free one—but in eleventh grade, she was the closest I’d ever been to it. She was the first person I’d met who’d been to rehab. Her father was in jail, and she wouldn’t tell me why. She’d moved more than five times. She kissed girls and boys. She said she’d once been suicidal, depressed. I’d seen both before, suicidal and depressed, but she managed to become them, to do them in a way that wasn’t corny as hell. And she was leaving next year, she told me, going for good, off to her boyfriend’s farm with two fluffy dogs.
Females are more likely to be depressed than males. Females may be more chemically predisposed to depression. Or maybe, females live in a world structured to drive them crazy. Maybe, females are placed in a world made for males. And who can function when she’s living for someone else?
Or maybe, depressed is how females are more likely to imagine themselves.
In poetry, there is nothing like a beautiful dead girl, like Annabel Lee who loved with a love that was more than love, or Juliet who is the fair sun that kills the envious moon, or Dorcas for whom Joe Trace will never stop crying because she’s dead and forever dangerous, forever beautiful.
But if death is hard to commit to, the second best option is when she’s almost there, dead in the head. In "Girl, Interrupted," the movie version, Angelina Jolie’s character pleads for Wynona Rider’s character to hurt her, and she is so fragile, so volatile, so intensely interesting, because she can control everyone around her, make everyone else’s existence so painful and raw—but she can’t hurt herself. Sula shrugs her shoulders after sleeping with Nel’s husband. Dewey Dell, even if she’s scared, is a “wet seed wild in the hot blind earth,” on the tipped point of sanity. Norms don’t matter because these girls are irreversibly, darkly broken. You can’t fix them, just like you can’t tell a starving child to mind his manners. They’re unserious with the real world, because what matters, what limits them, is deep. Something you wouldn’t understand even if you tried.
To be dangerously free is to use the smoke and clatter and dance of the world to free you from yourself. It would be easy, even safe, to say that this obsession with pretty dead girls, beautiful depression, femininity, is all socially constructed because of patriarchal society and violence against women and the white male gaze and “this is why we need feminism!!!”—which I would buy if I thought the issue was simple. If I didn’t find myself being so, so complicit. But even if you asked me to tell a story, my pretty 15 pages would be about a sad, gendered body.
Is it objectification to write about a broken body in place of a broken heart? And when you gleefully, enthusiastically, happily, lovingly objectify yourself, even in something as stupid as a story, because it works and because it makes sense, where does that leave you? I want to know what happens when pain is so pretty that without it you’d be normal. I want to know if there’s a place where pain stops hurting, or maybe, where it still hurts the same but you just don’t care because it feels so right.
There were times, when I showed her writing and she showed me drawings, that I thought I could have been wild too. It was just that I was smart first/too Asian for my parents to let me out of the house after 6 p.m., let alone survive a painkiller addiction/too non-confrontational to sneak out/planning to go to college/too content and emotionally stable/living in my head/aiming, in general, to live old rather than die young. I didn’t want to lose. Which made me the opposite of wild. But in those moments, I just wanted to be intoxicating.
She walked into gym class with her arm sleeved up in pen patterns so intricately done it seemed to be a waste that they were temporary. Once our gym teacher was absent so we hung out in the health classroom and she pressed a pen to my arm but I told her not to because my parents would kill me and she called me a square.
What is so interesting about the way a square crumples into a ball? Is it fetishization, the way we mourn suicide, the way we claim martyrs and virgins? Or is it natural, like how communal animals always take care of the weakest, like how we love stories that make us feel things? Are there no alternatives?
Someone once told me that depression was addicting. That once you were in it, you felt parts of yourself you never knew existed ache, and when you were out they stopped existing. You wanted them back. I asked her about that, and she glared at me. Then she told me she would never ever want to feel the way she did again. So I trusted her.
Later in the year, a boy in my English class walked in with insanely detailed drawings on his left arm. She’d signed it. Night purple lipstick stuck pretty on his skin and outlined in pen. I was surprised that I was so surprised. She, like me, knew other people, flirted, had a life, and I knew that. But I guess everyone wants to save a pretty girl. Everyone wants to know her. Everyone wants to own a part of her dark, twisted-up world.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s 2016, and the battle for fossil fuel divestment continues around the globe. Over 500 organizations with $3.4 trillion in assets have committed to divest so far. The state of California, after committing to divest its pension funds from coal last year, is now calling on all insurers in the state to divest. Mayor Bill de Blasio has called for New York City to stop investing in coal, and the governor of Vermont is calling for divestment from both coal and ExxonMobil due to the company’s record of deception on climate change.
Last week, the city of Copenhagen announced it would divest from all fossil fuels. And the movement has growing cultural cachet as Leonardo DiCaprio joins the fray.
And yet, universities have been slow to move. MIT refused to divest last fall due to a fear of backlash from the fossil fuel industry, and students have been carrying out an epic three-month-long sit-in in protest. (Harvard has continued its usual stonewalling on the issue.) Even as the world agreed in Paris to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius—and 1.5 degrees if possible—most universities continue to finance activities that would result in much greater amounts of climate change. Rhetorically, universities care about climate change. Financially, they pretend it doesn’t exist. Yet it doesn’t have to be like this.
On climate, universities have a problem with blurred lines. They want to fight climate change, but at the same time they want to stay in the good graces of donors who don’t care about the issue; they want to be friends with the fossil fuel industry (which gives them money); they want to avoid the need to formulate ethical positions. What’s a university that wants to have it all to do?
We could, of course, keep having blurred lines. Blurred lines let us feel like we can have it all. The problem is that we need to have clear lines to deal with climate change. Our children would like us to have clear lines. The rest of the world and countless species on Earth need us to have clear lines. In the face of the climate problem, it is our responsibility to draw those lines in good faith and to be bold in our lives.
The Paris agreement, aspirational as it is, is one such clear line. It states what we intend to do for the sake of all living things on Earth, including our children. An aspiration, though, must be reflected in action in order to live. At present, Harvard ignores the calling of the Paris agreement by investing in activities that undermine it. But Harvard could align its actions with the agreement and help to give it life.
Last December, a committee at the University of Toronto released a report on the issue of divestment, drawing a clear line by aligning itself with the needs of the Paris agreement. It recommended that the university not finance companies whose “actions blatantly disregard the international effort to limit the rise in average global temperatures to not more than one and a half degrees Celsius above pre-industrial averages by 2050…These are fossil fuels companies whose actions are irreconcilable with achieving internationally agreed goals.” This principle, basic as it is, aligns rhetoric and action. It suggests that it is all institutions’ responsibility to give life to the Paris agreement. Harvard could adopt this Toronto principle, too, and the world would be better for it.
In practice, adopting the Toronto Principle would likely mean moving investments away from coal companies and coal-fired power plants, companies seeking non-conventional or aggressive fossil fuel development (such as oil from the Arctic or tar sands), and possibly also companies that distort public policies or deceive the public on climate. At present, these activities are incompatible with the agreement in Paris.
Adopting the Toronto Principle would put pressure on companies to align themselves with the Paris agreement. It would provide Harvard with credibility and leverage when engaging with companies on climate, and it would set a clear example to other institutions that could be emulated elsewhere. In principle, Harvard’s alignment with international climate goals could inform not only its investment activity, but also its research, teaching, and emissions.
Of course, calls for full divestment from all fossil fuels will surely continue. The Toronto Principle may not go far enough, but in a world of blurred lines, it is a clear one. It is the least we should do for the sake of our children, for the rest of the world, and for human dignity.
As an iconic institution, let us not undermine the future of life on Earth. What will it gain us in the end? And what will it cost us? Let us draw at least this clear line. Let’s base our actions not on a vision of a future we fear, but on a healthy vision; a future we desire.

Last week, The Crimson reported that a committee made up of graduate students, undergraduates, and professors had been created to review the University’s Title IX policies and to recommend potential changes. The committee—whose exact mandate remains unclear—is chaired by former interim Dean of the College Donald H. Pfister.
Harvard announced its first University-wide sexual assault policies in July 2014 when both Harvard College and Harvard Law School were under investigation by the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights for repeatedly mishandling sexual assault cases. Harvard’s subsequent reforms were then hailed as a step in the right direction on an urgent and previously under-discussed issue. However, it soon became clear that the new policies had been assembled too hastily: For example, not a single Law School professor was consulted in their drafting.
The results of this failure of consultation were clear. Twenty-eight Harvard Law School professors took to the pages of The Boston Globe to argue that the University’s policies, designed with the intent of meeting the Title IX requirements, would do “more harm than good.” As one signatory of the Globe statement put it, under the new policies there would be “no separation of the judge, the prosecutor, and the investigator.” Soon, a Law School committee had adopted new procedures for sexual assault cases that corrected many deficiencies in the University’s initial reforms.
We agreed with the Law School professors that the University’s new policies, although well intentioned, did not provide for sufficiently impartial investigations that would protect both accuser and accused. We hope now that Harvard can reform its Title IX policies once again, this time bringing the Law School professors’ unique perspectives to bear.
We are encouraged by the sense that Harvard could be moving in the right direction on sexual assault by tailoring the University-wide policies to more closely resemble the Law School’s. The fact that this review committee is made up of people from across the University's schools and even includes a Law School professor who signed the Globe op-ed is a promising sign.
We also hope that the committee will take this opportunity to formalize policy changes that were adopted last October when a ten-page “Frequently Asked Questions” document was posted to the University Title IX Office's website. While many of the clarifications outlined in the FAQ were positive, they should be incorporated into the official sexual assault policy in a manner that is transparent, timely, and mindful of the gravity of the issue.
Finally, the committee should recognize that it is time for Harvard to join the more than 1,400 other institutions of higher education that use the affirmative consent standard in their sexual assault policies. We have spoken out strongly in support of such a standard, and continue to believe that it is the best standard for Harvard to adopt.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After spending the summer researching around the world, 17 seniors presented their findings at the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs’ undergraduate thesis conference last Thursday and Friday.
In its ninth year, the conference serves as a venue for undergraduates who received senior thesis funding from the Weatherhead Center to share their research and receive feedback. According to Clare Putnam, coordinator of student programs and fellowships for the Weatherhead Center, funding grants range from $1,000 to more than $6,000. However, funding is not the Center's only form of support.
“We want to do more than just give them a check and say good luck,” Putnam said, emphasizing that the Center helps seniors throughout their last year.
The annual conference serves as the culmination of a year-long process beginning with the selection of juniors from a competitive applicant pool early in their spring semester. Once selected, each student is matched with one of the Weatherhead Center’s graduate student associates, who provides advice before students embark on their research over the summer.
“I met one-on-one with my grad adviser, and she would help me think about my questions from a very different perspective,"  Economics concentrator Bianca Mulaney ’16, a recently-named Marshall Scholar, said. "She helped me really think about these questions in a more socially conscious manner."
Mulaney’s research examined the effects of antibiotic use in agricultural production from an economic perspective, a topic she first encountered during the summer after her freshman year.
Although the thesis projects vary greatly in subject, discipline, and location, they all relate to global research, the Weatherhead Center's specialty.The Weatherhead Center is the largest international research center within the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
As such, the vast majority of students use part of their grant money to travel abroad. Mulaney’s research took her to London and Denmark, where she visited a pig farm.
“We feel like the research project is important, but the research experience in the field abroad is also important,” Putnam said.
Creating a unique academic space for students is also important, Weatherhead Center director and Sociology professor Michèle Lamont said in her opening remarks at the event.
“I’ve never really been a part of a scholarly community like this where people are so interested and engaged in discussing their academic inquiries with you, and that’s something I found very refreshing and made this experience particularly enriching,” Mulaney said.
After their presentation, students received feedback and answered questions from members of the audience. Putnam said she usually asks each of the Weatherhead Center’s graduate student associates to attend one presentation, and that they make up a large portion of the attendees.
Other projects included an examination of the Syrian refugee crisis in Jordan and a study of Islam and politics within Tunisia.
“Resources for funding at Harvard are multiple, and many students want to take advantage of their years here to explore the world—well, we empower that,” Lamont said. “ That’s what we’re about.”

After a committee reviewing General Education recommended a program-wide section target of 12 students, members of a graduate student campaign aimed at lowering section sizes are reevaluating their priorities.
Last month, the Gen Ed review committee’s final proposal acknowledged the campaign’s long-lauded goal when it recommended a target of 12 students for all Gen Ed course sections. Members of the Harvard Teaching Campaign said they view the proposal—which faculty will likely vote on in the spring—as a positive development, they hope to expand that target to all College courses.
“We see that as a major step forward, but there’s lots more work to be done,” campaign member Christina V. Groeger ’08 said. “We’re hoping to see that policy extended and deepened across not just Gen Ed, but all lecture courses and labs as well.” 
Members of the campaign last met with Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris in August,  Groeger said, noting that at the time they were told the target size for Gen Ed courses would be 15 students. That target applied to Gen Ed sections last semester, Groeger said.
Groeger said she was told budgetary constraints kept administrators from lowering the target number. Members of the teaching campaign had specifically asked for a cap of 12 in a petition they delivered to Massachusetts Hall last April.
Now that the Gen Ed committee has officially recognized the size of 12, the Teaching Campaign pans to reboot. Members have considered the differences between departments when strategizing on how to apply a new target cap to all undergraduate courses.
Campaign supporter Andrew B. Donnelly, a teaching fellow in the English department, said reducing section sizes is more important for specific departments, namely those in the humanities.
“What I would like to see is a process where students and the TFs have more input in what the best arrangement for class is to maximize the student learning,” he said.
In sections for science classes—particularly labs—there is less need for round table, intimate discussion, some graduate students say. Post doctoral fellow student Shan Lou, one of 27 teaching fellows for Life Sciences 1b: “An Integrated Introduction to the Life Sciences: Genetics, Genomics, and Evolution,” said she thinks having 16 students in a section works well given the bench-style setup of the room.
“They usually work as a group of four. Most of the discussions and conversations and experiments were carried out in groups,” Lou said of students in her sections.
Aside from classroom setup, Lou also highlighted a notable difference between education in the sciences and the humanities.
“The reason that every student gets at least a chance to talk is because most of the answers are not as long as the humanities courses,” Lou said, referring to answers students supply in sections.
Groeger said the campaign does not intend to create a mandatory policy with a section size limit given the nuances of certain teaching methods.
“If any course head or instructor doesn’t want to have 12-person sections, that’s fine,” she said. “I think in some ways the administration is making it a bit more complicated than it needs to be.”
Looking ahead, Groeger said while graduate students have many concerns outside of teaching, the section size issue should remain the campaign’s primary focus since it “creates the most common ground with undergraduates and faculty.”
“We’re going to be having some planning meetings to kind of figure out what’s the best way to keep pressure on the administration,” Groeger said. “It’s an ongoing issue.”

Nashua, N.H.—On the Saturday morning before the New Hampshire presidential primary, school buses packed with Boston-area college students shuttled into the otherwise quiet city of Nashua to rally supporters for their favorite candidates.
More than 50 Harvard College Democrats braved the snow to join the fray— and occasional ornery residents— to canvass for their chosen candidate across the mom-and-pop shop lined streets of New Hampshire’s second-largest city.
The Democrats were split among supporters of establishment-backed former Secretary of State Hillary R. Clinton, and the self-described democratic socialist Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Fortified by an early group breakfast in Quincy House, the energized Democrats filed into two school buses on Harvard’s quiet and hungover campus at 9 a.m. Saturday morning, receiving a briefing from Katherine Wang ’19 on local demographics and voter history on the hour ride up. By 10:30 a.m., the students hit Nashua’s snow plowed streets.
Both campaigns enlisted the support of Granite Staters using the “Get Out The Vote” canvassing technique, where volunteers seek out likely supporters identified through research and focus on ensuring they cast their vote on election day. Volunteers use this campaigning method near election time, when most voters have already decided on their favorite candidate.
Susan X. Wang ’17, President of the Harvard College Democrats and a Clinton supporter, described the process as “a little less voter convincing, a little more getting people to go vote on Tuesday.”
The trip, organized by the Harvard College Democrats, included members of both Harvard Students for Bernie and Harvard Students for Hillary, eager to explain the merits of their candidates to locals. Members of the competing factions amicably shared intentionally mixed buses, united in their opposition to the Republicans.
Students who canvassed for Clinton were greeted at her Nashua headquarters by Massachusetts Congressman Joseph P. Kennedy III, who encouraged the undergraduates campaigning to help shape the country’s future.
“Obviously every four years you get to have a huge impact on elections,” Kennedy said in an interview. “This is absolutely critical to have young folks that are able to come up and understand all that goes into those campaigns.”
The streets of Nashua were not only filled with Democrats. “We did come across some Jeb Bush canvassers, and that was a little awkward,” Sanders-supporter Dominique J. Erney ’19 said.
This divide is common in New Hampshire, a swing state famous for its first-in-the-nation primary. With its independent and libertarian-leaning electorate, the state’s primary comes on the heels of the Iowa Caucuses, in which Texas Senator Ted Cruz and Clinton prevailed.
Theda R. Skocpol—a Government professor specializing in American politics—said she predicts Sanders and Republican candidate Donald J. Trump  will likely win in New Hampshire as the Republican field whittles down to “three or four candidates.”
Skocpol’s predictions reflect the findings of the most recent Boston Globe New Hampshire poll, which has Trump leading the GOP field with 29 percent of the Republican vote and Sanders leading the Democrats with 50 percent to Clinton’s 41 percent.
Nashua locals said they enjoyed the excitement that permeates the otherwise sleepy city every four years come election time.
Jason A. Matukas, a local Uber driver, said the city seemed substantially busier than during the 2012 primary season. Matukas said he saw a surge in college student traffic in the days leading up to the primary on Tuesday, mainly from “Boston colleges.”
Towards the end of the day, a group of Democrats departed for nearby Manchester to join a rally advocating for a higher minimum wage just outside where Saturday evening’s Republican debate was hosted.
Wang said she hope this trip will foster communal sentiments among the two Democratic factions, despite their differences in candidate preference.
“At the end of the day, we’re all Democrats, and we’re all here to make sure a Republican doesn’t win the White House in 2016,” Wang said.

A University-wide task force charged with investigating sexual assault prevention has yet to issue a finalized set of recommendations—missing an initial January deadline—although administrators hope to release the report this month.
University President Drew G. Faust convened the group in 2014 and tasked a group of students, faculty, and administrators to offer policy recommendations on the prevention of sexual assault. The body, created shortly after The Crimson published an anonymous op-ed written by a student critical of Harvard's response to sexual assault, will also review the results of a sexual conduct climate survey conducted last year.
In a public letter to Faust when Harvard released the survey data, Steven E. Hyman, former provost and chair of the task force, wrote that the body planned to send a report of final recommendations— which could advise a number of broad changes and is still in progress— to Faust in January 2016.
Faust said in a Feb. 1 interview that she has not yet seen a draft of the report, but noted the task force’s final recommendations will build on interim proposals.
“It’s been intervening constantly, saying: ‘Okay, we’re going to improve orientation; we’re going to improve the website; we’re going to improve communication; we’re going to have a campaign after the questionnaire to urge people to go get help and make sure people know what resources are available’” Faust said.
Hyman wrote in a statement that he hopes to finish the report later this month.
“It will include a summary of recommendations that we previously made and which the University has already implemented, such as the doubling of resources at OSAPR, the launch of the SHARE resource web portal, and the sexual conduct survey that was designed and implemented together with the AAU,” Hyman wrote. “The report will have a major focus on new recommendations for the University's consideration.
The task force already made two sets of interim recommendations that, among other suggestions, propose revamping training, examining social spaces, and increasing funding for the Office of Sexual Assault and Prevention.
The task force's first set of recommendations, released in May 2014, suggests more funding for the Office of Sexual Assault and Prevention Response and the creation of a centralized website with resources about responding to sexual assault. Faust accepted the recommendations, which doubled the staff of OSAPR and led to the creation of the website focused on “Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Education.”
The May 2014 report emphasized the importance of student training and orientation and proposed surveying the student body about sexual assault on campus.
The second set of interim recommendations from May 2015 also focus on student orientation programs, offering proposals to expand sexual assault prevention education—a recommendation that students critical of Harvard’s response to sexual assault  have repeatedly demanded. The report also suggests that administrators reexamine school policies on social life and party venues.
“In the meantime, we recommend that the Schools consider their policies and practices as they relate to student use of campus space or other socially-focused policies to evaluate whether they are having incidental and unintended consequences,” the May 2015 report states.
The pending final report will come as many undergraduates denounce Harvard's response to sexual assault, and officers of at least one of the College’s historically male final clubs factored the recommendations into a decision to go co-ed.
“If the Fox Club does not become a coed club, it will be categorized with all the other clubs when Harvard releases qualitative sexual assault information,” Fox Club undergraduate officers wrote to club graduates last October.
Jessica R. Fournier ’17, an organizer for the anti-sexual assault advocacy group Our Harvard Can Do Better, said she was frustrated by what she called a lack of transparency regarding the task force’s timeline, decisions, and membership criteria.
“I think the most important thing coming out of this report is that what gets recommended is actionable and implemented, and that this report should have detailed suggestions for what needs to change,” Fournier said. “A document like this should not be meaningless, but if change is not actually taken in the future, it is meaningless.”
In the last few years, Harvard has overhauled and reexamined its approach to sexual assault. Most recently, the University overhauled its Title IX policies in 2014, instituting a “preponderance of the evidence” standard for investigating allegations of sexual assault and harassment and established a centralized office for investigating sexual assault. A federal investigation into the College’s Title IX compliance is ongoing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During a year in which the safety and accessibility of the College’s social scene has dominated campus conversation, a new policy in Mather House outlaws residents from consuming hard alcohol in the Junior Common Room, a space students often use to host parties.
The changes— implemented by Mather House masters Christie McDonald and Michael D. Rosengarten, as well as Mather’s Resident Dean Luke Leafgren—aim to make parties “safer” in Mather, according to Leafgren.
When events include hard alcohol, students have the option to get “a lot more drunk, a lot more quickly," Mather House Committee co-Chair Avni Nahar ’17 said. She added that the policy's creators hope to appease House staff by reducing the chance that unsafe drinking occurs—and, by extension, potentially decrease the likelihood of sexual assault.
Nahar said students were not consulted prior to the decision to ban hard alcohol, but after she and her co-Chair Trevor A. Mullin ’17 requested student input, Leafgren held a meeting Sunday afternoon to discuss the changes.
“Students think that hard alcohol does play a role in the social scene at Harvard,” she said, adding that not all Mather residents completely agreed with the ban.
The change comes on the heels of a recent initiative in Cabot House to expedite party registration procedures in an effort to strengthen social life within the House. Cabot House co-Master and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana has prioritized promoting social life in the Houses throughout his deanship.
Mather House offers a “Fast Pass” party registration process similar to the Cabot initiative, and outside of those two Houses, administrators have made efforts to promote partying on Harvard property.
In October, women groups at the College threw a school-wide party, which administrators have lauded as an example of an inclusive social event.
“The HoCo strives to make safe and inclusive social spaces, and make choices that prioritize student safety and provide an outlet for social interaction,” Mullin said. “We will continue to promote a safe environment by not providing high grade alcohol.”
Per Harvard policy, Houses are not permitted to provide students with hard liquor except for formals, meaning the policy change in Mather primarily affects those wishing to hold private events in the JCR. The House Committee sometimes uses the room for social events.
Leafgren said students’ reaction to the changes— which solely McDonald, Rosengarten, and himself made—have been “mixed.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council voted Sunday to rebrand and repurpose its Bridging and Belonging Fund to encourage its use by allowing students and student groups to apply for funding for the first time.
The Bridging and Belonging Fund, initially established in 2014 under then-UC President Gus A. Mayopolous ’15 and Vice President Sietse K. Goffard ’15, allocated $30,000 for student groups to work in collaboration to organize events, though student groups did not themselves apply for funding under the program. The UC’s Finance Committee and Office of Student life both fund half of the program’s costs.
“It was looking to bring different groups on campus together to throw events that they traditionally wouldn’t,” UC President Shaiba Rather ’17 said.
The Bridging and Belonging Fund has been historically underutilized, Rather and Vice President Daniel V. Banks ’17 said. Only $1,646.45 of the fund has been used in the 2015-2016 fiscal year, and only $3,600 was used in the 2014-2015 fiscal year.
Under the rebranded program, the UC President and Vice President will negotiate with the Dean of the College to establish a set of “compelling interests” each year, which the UC as a whole must confirm with a vote. These interests are intended to be issues that have “captivated student attention, all pursuing issues affecting the State of the College,” according to the legislation.
Now, groups of students, regardless of whether they are College-recognized, will be eligible to apply for funding under the program for events that align with one of the interests, with preference given to events that are collaborative across multiple student groups.
The compelling interest priorities for this year have yet to be officially determined, and are expected to be brought before the entire Council next week, according to Rather.
The rebranded program will also feature a new name, logo, and a marketing campaign intended to inform the student body about how to apply for grants under the fund.
“We want to redefine the mission of the fund, we want to re-present it to students, and we really want it to engage with students,” Rather said.
The proposal was sponsored by Rather, Banks, Finance Committee Chair William A. Greenlaw ’17, and Treasurer Samarth Gupta ’18.
Also during the meeting, the UC voted to grant $500 to the Harvard College Computer Society’s Datamatch initiative. The additional funding will go toward “the expansion of number of possible dates and restaurant partnerships within the Datamatch program,” according to the text of the legislation.
The UC also voted to allocate $5,021 to various campus student groups in its first grants package of the semester.

UPDATED: February 8, 2016, at 4:27 a.m.
Student-nominated speakers from across Harvard presented TED-talk style mini-lectures at the sixth annual “Lectures that Last” in front of a packed Memorial Church audience Saturday evening.
With topics ranging from bilingualism to successful marriages, and from racial inclusion to economic development, the professors and deans on the stage challenged the audience to think differently about events in their everyday lives. The event was targeted for graduate students across the Harvard.
Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Dean Xiao-Li Meng, who is also a professor and former chair of the Statistics department, wove math and marriage advice together in his talk.
“The law of regression toward the mean tells us that disappointment is inevitable when we start with extremely high expectations,” Meng said.
He described a wedding ring as a “perfect symbol” of the statistical phenomenon.
“Where any ring is expected to be a perfect circle mathematically, a closer inspection will almost always reveal some charming individualities,” he said. “It also reminds us that to love perfectly, we must accept each other for who we are.”
The entertaining talk sparked the most laughter of the night.
“I also hope I have given you a helpful line for your marriage or relationship: ‘Honey, it’s not me, it’s the regression toward the mean,’” Meng said.
Co-chaired by three graduate students, Saturday’s lectures were the most well-attended yet, according to Peter J. Dyrud, vice president of event coordination for the Harvard Graduate and Professional Student Government, which organized the event with support from the Provost’s Office.
“It was really funny, it was also really good advice, and I guess you know now that I’m in my late twenties at this point... it resonated with me and it was relevant to me,” said attendee Haithem Abdella, whose favorite speech was Meng’s.
Steven S. Rogers, a senior lecturer at Harvard Business School, spoke to the audience about the prison pipeline created by a lack of education and the overwhelming numbers of African Americans and Latinos in prison.
“So what’s the solution to the problem? And why should you care?” Rogers said. “The reason you should care is because, if nothing else, this is a very costly institution. It costs more on average to incarcerate a man than it does to send a person to Harvard.”
In a speech that touched on recent race-related controversies at Harvard Law School, Law professor Kenneth W. Mack delved into the definition of inclusion.
Some Law school students “have called for things that constitute a fundamental challenge to the rules that govern a University,” he said. “I think that those kinds of questions and those kinds of problems are entirely worthy of our attention.”
The co-chairs said the theme of the event “Crossroads” was inspired by the diversity of Harvard’s graduate student body.
“It was based on just the idea that we have so many people coming together from different backgrounds, different parts of the university, to come and share each other’s stories and learn from each other,” Dyrud said.

Second-year Law student Michael L. Zuckerman ’10 will take the helm of the influential Harvard Law Review after being elected its 130th president last week, set to replace outgoing president Jonathan S. Gould.
Zuckerman hails from Princeton, New Jersey and graduated from Harvard College in 2010 with a degree in Social Studies. He worked as an associate at the Boston Consulting Group and a research assistant for David Gergen, a Harvard Kennedy School professor. Zuckerman will join the ranks of prominent former Law review presidents including current United States President Barack H. Obama and seventh circuit court of appeals judge Richard A. Posner.
The Harvard Law Review, established by Louis D. Brandeis in 1887, is one of the most cited and oldest student-edited law journals in the United States. Student editors publish the roughly 2,500-page journal—which contains a combination of student work, contributions from outside scholars, and reviews of recent books by legal experts—monthly from November to June.
“Mike is a brilliant editor whose deep dedication to the Law Review’s mission and community have earned him the admiration of his peers, all of whom will benefit from his wisdom, kindness, and tireless work ethic in the year ahead,” Gould said in a press release. “Mike will make a terrific president, and I look forward to watching him lead the Review in the coming year.”
Zuckerman said he is already busy with work for the Law review, and is looking forward to leading its Board of Editors.
"The Law Review is a collection of ninety-two of the most talented, hard-working, and thoughtful people I have ever had the privilege to know. To get to work so closely with each of them to serve this institution makes me feel like the luckiest person in the world,” Zuckerman wrote in an email. “We are all looking forward to doing everything we can to carry on the journal's tradition of excellence."

After Joseph Gordon-Levitt stripped to his boxers and ran into the audience wearing a superman costume, the famed actor accepted the Hasty Pudding Theatricals’ Man of the Year Award Friday in Farkas Hall.
Gordon-Levitt, known for his his role in films including “(500) Days of Summer,” “Looper,” and “10 Things I Hate About You,” played along with the Hasty Pudding members, who made jokes about Gordon-Levitt’s movies, saying his roles in both “Don Jon” and “Elektra Luxx” held strong sexual overtones. Gordon-Levitt then gave a  one of the male cast members— who was dressed as a female Russian porn star—a lap dance.
During the press conference that followed the comedy roast, the actor said he initialyl did not know what to expect from the night.
“I had seen pictures of various men from show business whom I respect very much dressed in flamboyant costumes,” he said. “That’s about all I knew,” adding that he did not know he would take off his pants.
Gordon-Levitt also said that he had a positive experience at Harvard during his two days on campus. He contrasted its campus culture with that of Columbia University, where he spent nearly four years before dropping out.
“I came out of [Columbia] a little bit pessimistic about the people that were in my class,” he said. “A lot of people that studied to be engineers, that were learning science, ended up becoming I-bankers….but I really notice the difference here.”
He then praised the sense of humor and thoughtfulness that he had experienced during his interactions with Hasty Pudding members.
“It really leaves me optimistic about people who are younger than I am,” he said.
Earlier in the day, a sizeable crowd braved snowy conditions and gathered on Winthrop Street to see the Hasty Pudding present Gordon-Levitt as the 50th Man of the Year.
Hasty Pudding Theatricals gives the award to actors who have made a significant contribution to the entertainment industry. Previous recipients of the award include director Steven Spielberg and actor Robert Downey Jr. 
Audience member and longtime Gordon-Levitt fan Mason S. Barnard ’16 said he enjoyed seeing the actor at the public event.
“Joseph Gordon-Levitt seems like a real person. He’s very down to earth, and that’s what I think sets him apart from other people,” Barnard said. “I totally have a man crush on him.”

Harvard wrestling (5-4, 3-3 EIWA, 1-3 Ivy League) was unable to extend its win streak this weekend at home, dropping back to back contests to Ivy League foes Princeton and Penn at the Malkin Athletic Center. The Tigers (5-6, 4-3 EIWA, 2-0 Ivy League) and the Quakers (4-3, 4-4, 1-1) outwrestled the Crimson, 16-19 and 9-26 respectively, knocking the Crimson out of Ivy League contention.
“It was a big weekend for us going into it,” Head Coach Jay Weiss said. “We knew those teams are good, so we trained accordingly. In that first match against Princeton, our guys put us in a position to win. Our guys wrestled hard, they wrestled well and we just didn’t do enough to finish it. We had some good efforts throughout the lineup, so it was tough to be so close and not get the win there.”
PENN 9-26
Following the close loss against Princeton, the Crimson was unable to find its rhythm against the Quakers, with just three Harvard wrestlers registering wins in the match.
“Against Penn it was just different matchups not going our way,” Weiss said. “I think we wrestled better against Princeton. It’s always about progression for us, so it’s really important for us to learn from this match against Penn, and use it to our advantage.”
Co-captain Todd Preston and senior Devon Gobbo were the only two Harvard wrestlers able to finish the day undefeated, as they both notched additional wins against Penn.
“Penn is a tough team,” Preston said. “They showed up ready to wrestle, and we came out a little flat. But that’s something we can work on in the future.”
Preston wrestled second in the match, and his 3-1 decision brought the Crimson to a short-lived 3-3 deadlock with Penn, who busted the lead open in the next bout.
The third winner for the Crimson during the bout with Penn was freshman Nolan Hellickson, who rebounded from his loss against Princeton to earn a decision against Penn’s Jeremy Schwartz, 8-3.
“Even our guys that lost did a really solid job,” Weiss said. “Josh Popple wrestled a tough one, and that was a close bout. He outwrestled that kid in the last periods, so we’ve got to take some positives away from that. The big thing we have to do is make sure that we beat them when it counts.”
PRINCETON 16-19
The Crimson started the day of competition going head to head with Princeton, who Harvard has not beaten in a dual meet since 2013.
“Obviously it’s tough to go into the last bout of competition in a tie,” Weiss said. “We were right there with them, but ultimately couldn’t lock it down.”
Preston, ranked ninth in the country at the 141-weight class, established Harvard’s first lead of the day. Preston notched a major decision against Princeton’s Jordan Laster, giving Harvard the go ahead point and bringing the score to 10-9.
Princeton soon answered, as immediately following Preston’s match, co-captain Patrick Hogan was outwrestled by Princeton’s Chris Perez, 3-2, bringing Princeton to a four point lead, that proved difficult to recover from.
Senior Jeffrey Ott came through in a big way for the Crimson, pinning Princeton’s Noah Ajram at 133.
“He did a great job for us the whole day,” Weiss said. “He wrestled tough from start to finish, which was what we needed from him.”
Another standout performance came from sophomore Josef Johnson. While the sophomore lost to both his opponents of the day, Johnson wrestled his No. 16 ranked Princeton rival to an overtime period.
“I mean, that’s a top kid he’s wrestling against and he did really well,” Weiss said. “He’s finally seeing that he can compete against the best of them, and he’s just improving every week.”
The last bout of the match proved unsuccessful, as senior Michael Mocco lost by decision to Tiger Abram Ayala at 184.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The opening tip fell into her path, and freshman guard Madeline Raster collected the ball, raced towards the basket, and laid it in.
That was about as good as it got for the Harvard women’s basketball team (8-10, 3-2 Ivy), who shot a dismal 25.0% from the field in a 68-48 loss to Penn on Friday night at Lavietes Pavilion.
The conference-leading Quakers (15-3, 4-0), fueled by an 18-1 run from that Raster basket until well into the second quarter, led by as many 29 on the night. The Crimson were never closer than 16 in the second half.
“[We] were supposed to take care of the ball, [we] were not supposed to thread the needle with their decisions,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “We played tight. We played like a team that had expectations. They played like a team that’s confident and believe in themselves… they played looser.”
The team’s top scorer, captain AnnMarie Healy, led all scorers once again with 18 points on 7-of-16 shooting. Her two fellow seniors, captain Kit Metoyer and guard Shilpa Tummala, shot 1-for-12 and 1-for-10 from the field, respectively. It was the first time either had taken double digit attempts without converting at least two baskets this season.
Harvard’s ice cold shooting saw the team go over 11 minutes without a field goal during Penn’s early run. After Raster’s opening layup, the Crimson didn’t hit from the field until Healy converted a mid-range jumper with nearly two minutes gone in the second quarter.
“Our offense just wasn’t where it needed to be, so that dug us into a really deep hole,” Metoyer said. “We missed a lot of shots that we normally make. We missed a lot of freebies, like layups, free throws, which can really hurt you against a team that is defensively-oriented like Penn is.”
Penn came into the game with its traditional 2-3 zone setup on defense, while its twin tower pairing of Sydney Stipanovich and Michelle Nwokedi patrolling the paint and denying ball entry. Healy was often isolated on one side of the paint, with the Quakers’ Lauren Whitlatch doubling her when the ball rotated to Healy’s side.
This left openings for Metoyer, Raster, and Tummala from the outside, but Harvard missed its first 16 three-pointers. It took over 24 minutes of game time for the first to fall, with Tummala’s trey cutting Penn’s lead to 42-16 midway through the third frame.
“We couldn’t put the ball in the basket. Period. It’s that simple,” Delaney-Smith said. “When you’re statistical leaders are [so poor], that’s no good. Penn’s a good team, you can’t beat them and shoot like that… and then get blown off on the boards.”
Stinpanovich and Nwokedi, both 6’3”, came into the game as the Quakers’ leading scorers, but were quiet for the most part on Friday night. They combined to shoot 8-of-22 (36.3%) from the floor with the Crimson’s guards constantly hounding them. Penn’s guards weren’t particularly hot, but a couple of wide open triples by Kasey Chambers, who led the team with 16 points, helped to reverse any momentum Harvard picked up.
“The quick ball movements and the shots, they’re not going to beat us on that,” Delaney-Smith said. “They’re going to make some, since they’re Division I basketball players, but they’re not great. It looks nice, but it’s not what’s actually going to hurt you.”
Harvard also struggled to clean up on the glass, with the Quakers leading in the second-chance points department, 17-3, thanks to 18 offensive rebounds and a +16 rebound differential overall.
“They didn’t shoot too well from the field,” Metoyer said. “But the big thing is you need to get that rebound. If you are going rely on them missing shots, you have to get that first rebound and not let their bigs get easy buckets. That’s kind of how they got going, I think."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Prior to Saturday night’s game between the Harvard men’s basketball team and its Penn counterparts, oddsmakers introduced the Quakers as one-point favorites. Given that the Crimson had held Penn to just 38 points in its last trip to the Palestra, it was one more notice that as the 21st century hits its Sweet Sixteen, the Crimson have lost the aura a five-time defending champion typically carries.
The game, a 67-57 loss that dropped the Crimson (9-13) to 1-5 in Ivy League play for the first time since 2008, was a validation for Vegas. After making three of its first four shots en route to a 7-0 lead, Harvard went ice-cold—making just 18 of 64 attempts the rest of the way. Penn’s 52-32 advantage on the glass made up for its 17 turnovers and the Quakers (8-11, 2-3) never trailed in the second half.
“You can find your way quickly and things can go south quickly and we’re on that slide right now,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said.
THE NEW GUARD
One of the storylines coming into the game was the presence of freshmen backcourts on both sides. While the quartet combined for just seven turnovers, their other contributions dominated the game. Harvard freshman Corey Johnson led the Crimson’s early surge, nailing three triples in the first 10 minutes of play to push Harvard to a 13-12 lead.
However, Johnson and backcourt mate Tommy McCarthy were cold the rest of the way. After a four-point play from McCarthy late in the first half, the duo never made another basket—missing all 11 of their shots (including eight triples) in the second period.
Much of that had to do with the presence of Penn freshman Jake Silpe on the other end. Silpe twice denied McCarthy at the rim, including a strip in transition that had the Harvard rookie demanding a foul. Silpe stuffed the box score with nine points, five rebounds, four assists, and three steals—narrowly besting McCarthy’s eight points, five assists, three boards, and two steals of his own.
After the game, Amaker said that McCarthy and Johnson—who took nearly half the team’s shots—need more assistance from their veteran counterparts. On the game, Harvard’s three seniors (captain Evan Cummins, Patrick Steeves, and Agunwa Okolie) combined for 26 shots, the same number as the freshman backcourt.
“I think when you have younger players in certain positions like the guard position you’re hopeful that the veterans around them can really help them and that’s probably what we need a little more for our team,” Amaker said.
SHOT SELECTION
On the weekend, the Crimson averaged just under 60 points a game but ran into different offensive problems in each game. Against Princeton, the team had 19 turnovers and made just nine of 20 foul shots—repeatedly bogging down an offense that otherwise made 49 percent of its shots and 64 percent of its threes.
The contest at the Palestra was an about-face in each category. Despite making 80 percent of its attempts from the charity stripe and committing just six turnovers, Harvard made just 31 percent of its shots. Harvard’s two best shooters, Johnson and junior Corbin Miller, hit just three of 19 triples.
In the postgame presser, Amaker noted that his team had simply missed a lot of layups and open threes—shots he noted the Crimson would take any time.
“If we got those shots again, we’ll make them,” Amaker said. “Corey had a ton of wide-open shots and was unfortunate that he didn’t make many of them for us. Corbin [is] another one who can be very streaky and it wasn’t in our favor tonight.”

Down by two with less than twenty seconds on the clock in the fourth quarter, co-captain AnnMarie Healy caught a pass from freshman Nani Redford with the shot clock dwindling down.
Healy took a dribble and despite the arms of three Princeton players in her face, she hit the turnaround jumper—overtime.
In overtime, however, the Harvard comeback bid faltered. After scoring on the opening drive, the Tigers (14-4, 3-1 Ivy)  scored six in a row and the Crimson (8-11, 3-3) couldn’t make up the deficit late in the extra frame.
Playing against a veteran Princeton squad that has more experience winning, the Crimson’s comeback bid came just a bit short in overtime, 92-83.
Facing a Tigers squad that has won five Ivy League titles in the past six years it was a gritty affair at Lavietes Pavilion on Sunday in a matchup that would feature 14 ties and six lead changes.
“They’re very physical,” senior guard Shilpa Tummala said. “They’re going to grab your jersey, they’re going to set hard screens, they’re going to be gritty, they’re going to box you out—it’s going to be a physical game the entire time. That’s the game of basketball, it’s a physical game, we can’t be wimps about it and complain about it, we just have to match it.”
Late in the fourth quarter, Princeton would take the lead three different times in the last three minutes, but the Crimson would answer each of the Tigers’ last three shots with a shot of their own.
With the exception of Princeton’s last possession, no team would miss a shot for the last three minutes of regulation. The quarter ended with Healy’s tying jumper, sending the game into overtime.
In what started as what appeared to be a blowout early on, the score was tied ten times in the second half and for much of the third and fourth quarters it almost seemed as if neither team was willing to miss.
The Tigers shot 56 percent from the field but Harvard one-upped them, shooting 64 percent from the field and 43 percent from three in the final half.
“We’re trying to get our looks, we’re trying to execute,” said Tummala. “AnnMarie is a great look for us inside. That turnaround jumper for her is money all the time. We try and feed that if we need and there’s also Kit’s three.”
In a first half where Princeton led by as much as 13, the Crimson’s comeback was nothing short of amazing. After turning the ball over on three of its first four possessions, Harvard couldn’t seem to hit a shot early on.
The Tigers’ senior guard Michelle Miller went off for 13 of her 28 points in the first quarter to give Princeton a commanding 19-6 lead seven minutes into the first.
“You’re just supposed to get out to her [Miller] on the catch,” head coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “She can go one on one with you and if she crosses you over and hits the pull up we’ll live with some of those, but we gave up too many open threes. It wasn’t any one person, but she shouldn’t have had so many good looks for the open three.”
The Tigers rang off 13 consecutive points before the Crimson could stop the bleeding with a layup from freshman guard Sydney Skinner to cut the lead to 11.
From here Harvard slowly dug into Princeton’s lead despite taking a lot of shots deep into the shot clock, including one from co-captain Kit Metoyer about four feet beyond the arc.
After a high scoring first quarter Harvard managed to slow down the Princeton offense, forcing turnovers and hitting timely shots.
The half ended with a drive from Healy that sent her to the line for two with the Crimson down by one, 29-30. The senior drained both to take the lead at the half.
Tummala and Healy ended up combining for 40 points and 11 rebounds. Coming off the bench, junior forward Destiny Nunley tied her career high with 12.
“I thought we played really well,” Delaney-Smith said. “I liked how we finished. I think we got a little hurt by a rebound or two down the stretch. We had outrebounded them most of the game and then ended up not outrebounding them and I think that was in the overtime and in the last couple minutes. They’re a veteran team and they know how to win. We’re a little less veteran and we’ve got to learn how to win.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two weeks into the season, the Harvard women’s water polo team came into the games hoping to prove their place among the top teams in the nation.
On the road for the first time this season, the No. 21 Crimson squad (5-1), buoyed by veteran leadership and a productive core of freshmen, continued its formidable start to the season, posting a 3-1 record at the Brown Invitational in Providence to push its overall record to 5-1. Along the way, Harvard defeated No. 13 Indiana for the first time in program history, having previously gone 0-13 all-time against the Hoosiers, and shouldered past No. 20 Marist, 9-8. The Crimson closed out the tournament with a blowout victory over St. Francis.
Harvard’s lone defeat came in a hard-fought match to No. 4 Hawaii to open the tournament.
HARVARD 16, ST. FRANCIS 3
From the opening sprint, the first ever meeting between the Crimson and St. Francis Brooklyn was a one-sided affair. Harvard shut out the Terriers (0-4) through 24 minutes and got four-goal performances each from junior attacker Melissa Balding, freshman attacker Kristen Hong, and sophomore attacker Sami Strutner to pace its offense.
“[Coach Ted Minnis] always talks about not playing down to teams,” senior attacker Charlotte Hendrix said. “We tried to just go into that game and play how we know how to play, and think of them as fourth-ranked Hawaii or 13th-ranked Indiana and think of how we came out against them. We were able to do that, put them down early, and kept them down the entire game.”
With its first double-digit margin win of the tournament, the Crimson swept the second day of its tournament slate.
HARVARD 12, NO. 13 INDIANA 11 (OT)
Hendrix scored the game-tying goal in regulation and again in overtime to launch Harvard to its first victory over Indiana (3-3) in 19 years. Down 10-9 in the waning minutes of the final quarter, the Crimson stepped up to the plate and forced overtime.
“We went into the fourth quarter and we just said, ‘guys, we’re not losing this game. Let’s go for it’,” Hendrix said.
Harvard got a six-on-five in the last few minutes, and junior defender Zoe Osborne’s errant pass landed right in front of Hendrix, who quickly took advantage of her good fortune and threw home the tying goal.
“It’s just one of those instances,” Hendrix said. “It gave us that edge back and gave us a chance to prove ourselves in overtime.”
The Crimson scored the first two goals in the overtime periods on goals from Hendrix and junior attacker Michelle Martinelli to take the lead for good.
HARVARD 9, NO. 20 MARIST 8
Senior attacker Yoshi Anderson netted a pair of goals in the final frame to lead Harvard to a comeback win over the Red Foxes (2-6).
Andersen was quick to note the toughness and resilience of the entire Crimson team in the face of a 5-7 fourth-quarter deficit.
“I think that we showed a lot of heart in those games,” Anderson said. “We didn’t cower to the fear of being in a close game. We rose to the occasion and it really showed that we’ve developed a lot as a team. We really flourished under the pressure this weekend, and I’m proud of everybody on the team.”
NO. 4 HAWAII 13, HARVARD 8
Harvard’s tournament opener against the Rainbow Wahines (9-1) remained a close game through three quarters, but Hawaii shut out the Crimson in the final frame to pull away.
“In the fourth quarter, we got a little complacent,” Hendrix said. “We started making small mistakes that,against a team that wasn’t ranked fourth in the country, we could’ve gotten away with, but Hawaii capitalized on them.”
Balding scored three on the game and Andersen netted two in the second quarter, but the lack of consistent production on the offensive end of the pool proved to be Harvard’s downfall.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first time since 2009, the Harvard women’s fencing team earned a share of the Ivy League Championship trophy, thanks to strong performances from the saber squad and an epee group that held its own despite its relative lack of experience.
“It’s always been incredibly close, but this competition we were finally able to come through with a win in one of the most competitive leagues for fencing,” junior co-captain Liana Yamin said. “It was really a matter of mentality of being the underdog and coming out with a fighting spirit.”
On the men’s side, the chase to build upon a three-year Ivy Championship streak ended on Sunday afternoon. After entering day two of the round robin event with a 2-1 overall record, the men dropped two matches against Columbia and Penn, both by 16-11 bout scores.
Women’s Fencing
Two consecutive seasons of second-place finishes had left the Crimson women’s squad hungry for the top spot, and that showed on Sunday afternoon.
“I think our key was our incredibly high energy and our ability to remain positive when things didn’t go our way,” junior co-captain Adrienne Jarocki said. “Even when we were losing, we just stayed positive and tried to win one bout at a time until we ended up winning [the championship].”
With a record of 4-1 and the Quakers standing in its way of a share of the Ivy title, the saber squad carried the team to the trophy. While the foil and epee groups both finished with bout records of 4-5 against Penn, the third weapon did not fail Harvard.
Jarocki and senior Aliya Itzkowitz both swept their three Quaker opponents—three times by 5-4 individual bout scores—and the youngest member of that trio, freshman Gabby Tartakovsky, had two bout wins of her own to carry the overall Crimson women to a 16-11 win.
The same three saber fencers were also the catalyst behind Harvard’s 3-0 start on Saturday, with wins over Yale, Princeton, and Brown. In those three matches, the saber women earned a 24-3 record.
“Adrienne really led the team in every round [and] every pressure situation,” Yamin said. “She always dominated each bout and set the tone…. [and] Aliya Itzkowitz was such a strong performer and a big part of why we were able to win against Princeton.”
Both Jarocki and Itzkowitz finished as first team All-Ivy members, with the former tallying a 17-1 record and the latter a 14-4 mark. Rounding out the women’s squad’s All-Ivy representation, Tartakovsky and epee fencer and freshman Shawn Wallace were second-team members thanks to double-digit bout wins.
“It’s just such an incredible feeling to win as a team,” Jarocki said. “There’s no better feeling than that.”
The title was the Harvard women’s fourth in program history.
Men’s Fencing
After a Saturday that saw the Crimson collect victories over Yale and Brown by scores of 22-5 and 18-9, respectively, and a loss to Princeton by a 17-10 bout score, Harvard was still in position to run the table and earn at least a share of its fourth-straight title.
However, it would be the trio of Columbia, Penn, and Princeton that would come away from Ithaca, N.Y., with their hands on the trophy, with Harvard trailing behind in fourth.
An injury to co-captain Duncan O’Brien, who up until that point had a 5-4 bout record, did not help the Crimson’s cause. After a 5-4 defeat to Columbia’s Michael Costin in his 10th bout, O’Brien did not return to the strip the rest of the day, and the saber group finished with a 4-14 record on the final day of competition.
Senior Sasha Ryjik was Harvard’s lone men’s saber All-Ivy recipient, with his 9-5 record enough for a second-team mention. For the epee group, Nicolas Simko tied for fourth as an individual with a 9-6 record and also was an All-Ivy second-teamer.
Despite the 2-3 overall finish as a group, the Crimson foil squad was the strongest of the other Ivy competitors. The left-right-uppercut combo of junior Stephen Mageras, senior Jerry Chang, and co-captain Michael Woo each finished with double-digit wins for the championships, with the first two earning first-team All-Ivy honors and the third earning a second-team nod.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the past two weekends, the Harvard Nordic and alpine team traveled to Vermont to compete in the UVM Winter Carnival. While the Nordic team raced January 30th to January 31st, the alpine team took to the snow this past weekend. The Crimson placed 10th of 16 teams overall for the third consecutive time this season.
In the Nordic races this weekend, the women’s team showed consistency and significant improvement. Junior Rachel Hampton led Harvard in the women’s 10K classic, clinching a 25th place with 29:30.2, while senior Hannah Barnes was hot on her heels at 28th place. With all six racers clocking in before 43rd place, the team claimed a top-five finish overall.
“The girls’ team did especially well…. [The finish] was unheard of for us,” co-captain Soren Anderson said. “Both the girls’ team and the guys’ team are on an upward trajectory.”
The Crimson placed 8th overall in the women’s 5K classic. Hampton again led the pack with in 19th with 12:35.7, followed by senior Annie Harvieux at 33rd and Hannah Barnes at 37th of 70 racers.
The men’s Nordic team felt the impact of a few illnesses this weekend, placing 11th in the 10K and 12th in the 5K. Anderson claimed first for the Crimson in 39th. Junior Ian Meyer and sophomore Liam Mulshine finished close behind at 44th and 45th, respectively, in the 10K.
“On the guys’ side, we all seemed to switch in and out of scoring positions, which was fun,” Anderson said. “We all get a chance to contribute.”
The trio of Anderson, Meyer, and Mulshine took 47th, 48th, and 49th of 68 in the 10K classic.
“This has been a really weird season. We’ve had two weeks on and then a by week, and both of the first two carnivals were a different format, so we’ve had a hard time getting into rhythm,” Anderson said.
This weekend, the alpine team performed well against both collegiate and unusual non-collegiate athletes. Skiers on the World Cup circuit, who had been in Austria only days prior to the race, decided to participate in the UVM Carnival for extra training.
Taking on the challenge of extra competition, sophomore Kelly Steeves placed in the top-25 for both the Giant Slalom and Slalom races. The Whistler, British Columbia native has consistently placed in the top-30s this season and last, gaining crucial points for the team.
“For Kelly to place so well amongst non-collegiate skiers was really incredible,” sophomore Pieter Weemaes said.
Freshman Molly Leavens followed Steeves in the GS at 43rd. In the slalom race, junior co-captain Kaitlyn Gibson placed 50th, and senior Samantha Udolf rounded out the Harvard showing at 51st.
On the men’s side, a variety of skiers contributed points throughout the races. Co-captain Simon Merryweather, freshman Dennis Bao, and Weemaes all qualified for the second round of the GS. Weemaes claimed first for Harvard at 41st with Merryweather close behind at 42nd and Bao finishing at 46th.
A particularly icy course allowed the skiers to stay competitive throughout the day, as the snow did not deteriorate as skiers raced through the same course. But the icy conditions meant mistakes had a greater impact on time than usual, which was seen in the slalom race.
“I made a pretty big error so I didn’t register to finish,” Weemaes said. “But as a team, we had an extremely good day, we were ninth overall for the day which was incredibly since normally we don’t place that many men into the result sheets at all.”
Merryweather led at 33rd, followed by junior Kalvis Hornburg, senior Dan Rittenhouse, and Bao, to boost the Crimson to a top-10 finish.
“That was one of our most successful days of alpine skiing,” Weemaes said.
With three carnivals under its belt and three more to go, the Harvard Nordic and Alpine team is at the middle of its season. As a whole, continuously improving technique and team chemistry has allowed the team to maintain consistent and upward-trending placement.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After dropping its first match of the weekend to No. 37 Memphis (4-2) 6-1 on Friday, No. 32 Harvard men’s tennis team (6-3) returned to the courts with a vengeance on Sunday to take on No. 27 Vanderbilt (3-3) in Nashville, Tenn.
At a 3-1 deficit after clinching the doubles point but losing three straight singles points early on, things were looking dire for the Crimson. But three consecutive victories from the remaining Harvard players, senior Brian Yeung, freshman Andy Zhou, and senior Kelvin Lam, allowed the Crimson to overpower the Commodores and bring home a win.
HARVARD 4, VANDERBILT 3
The match started off with a nail-biter doubles contest. After the Harvard duo of Lam and co-captain Conor Haughey handily defeated their Commodores opponents 6-4, Vanderbilt came back to beat out junior Sebastrian Beltrame and sophomore Kenny Tao at second doubles.
In the deciding third match, Co-Captain Nicky Hu and Yeung fought hard, ultimately eking out a tiebreaker win to take the match 7-5 and give the doubles point to the Crimson.
Harvard suffered an early deficit in the singles competition, however. At first singles, No. 71 Hu took on No. 64 Vanderbilt sophomore Daniel Valent, who went 31-6 in singles last season. Beltrame, Tao and Hu fell in straight sets to their Vanderbilt opponents.
The Crimson needed three wins from Yeung, Zhou, and Lam. And it got three hard-fought victories. Yeung overcame a tiebreaker in the second set to keep his lead and beat out his opponent. Zhou bounced back from dropping the first set and took the next two for a 3-6, 7-5, 6-2 win. Harvard’s win was wrapped up with a straight-set victory from Lam.
MEMPHIS 6, HARVARD 1
On Friday, Harvard struggled at the Currey Tennis Center. Haughey and Lam fell in first doubles, but Beltrame and Tao beat out their Memphis opponents to take second doubles. It came down to a close tiebreaker for Hu and Yeung, but the Crimson was ultimately unable to overcome Memphis sophomores No. 87 Andrew Watson and Shakeel Manji, giving the Tigers the doubles point.
The only point of the day came from Lam at sixth singles, won his set against Manji 6-4.  Zhou fell first to his opponent after an unsuccessful tiebreaker in the second set at fifth singles, while Memphis freshman Chirs Patzanovsky came back from a 6-1 loss to Tao to take the next two sets at fourth singles.

The No. 1 Harvard women’s squash team (7-0, 4-0 Ivy League) was in a New York state of mind this weekend. It rounded out its road stint with back to back wins against Ivy League rivals, defeating No. 7 Columbia (4-4, 2-2) on Saturday and No. 8 Cornell (6-5, 2-3) on Sunday.
HARVARD 9, No. 8 CORNELL 0
Cornell, just coming off an Ivy League win against Dartmouth, was preparing to host Harvard at the Belkin International Squash Courts in Ithaca, NY on Sunday. With the home court advantage and facing a team that had just faced a tough Columbia team on top of five hours of travel, it seemed that The Big Red had the advantage over the Crimson.
For the visitors, the freshmen continued to dominate the courts, with Sabrina Sobhy, Kayley Leonard, and Sophie Mehta all recorded wins for the Crimson. Sobhy easily handled Michèle Garceau in the first position, 11-8, 11-2, 11-6.
Leonard had the longest match of the day, with four games against Cornell’s Rachel Scherman at the No. 2 position. It seemed like it would be a battle after the first two games were won by each player by 3 points or less.
In the last position, Mehta made quick work of the Big Red’s Sydney Francis, giving up just five points overall in the match.
Sophomore Alyssa Mehta ended the weekend with two wins, after she defeated Margaux Losty. Fellow sophomore Sue Ann Yong had the second quickest win of the day, defeating her opponent 11-3, 11-5, 11-5.
Junior Katie Tutrone, senior Michelle Gemmell, and junior Dileas MacGowan also recorded sweeps against their opponents.
Co-captain Saumya Karki extended her win streak with a win at the No. 7 position against Lauren Leizman. Co-captain Isabelle Dowling also won in an exhibition match against Olivia Wherry, 11-3, 11-5, 11-7.
HARVARD 9, COLUMBIA 0
The Crimson picked up its fourth sweep of the year with its 9-0 win over the Lions at the SL Green StreetSquash Center in New York, N.Y.
Sobhy and Leonard, and Mehta all swept their opponents. While Leonard and Mehta made quick work of their opponents at the second and third positions, respectively, Sobhy battled it out with Columbia’s No. 1 player Tanyi Khanna in the No. 1 spot, winning two of her three games by just two points.
Senior Michelle Gemmell had the longest match of the day in the No. 5 spot, playing four games against one of the Lions’ top three players, Catherine Jenkins. After losing the first game 5-13, Gemmell rebounded with two straight 11-3 wins. A last-minute effort by Jenkins forced the final game to be played to over 11 points, but Gemmell never lost momentum and won 12-10.
To round out the second flight, both junior Katherine Tutrone and Yong made quick work of  their Columbia counterparts in 3-0 sweeps. This is Yong’s first win at the No. 6 position.
The last flight, like the first, were sweeps, with Karki and freshman Sophie Mehta remained undefeated with their sixth win of the season. Junior Dileas MacGowan defeated Addie Fulton at the No. 8 spot.
This win also marked its second straight against an Ivy League team, and its fifth against Columbia to extend its win streak to 5-0.
“Leading up to nationals we are trying to keep our fitness level high,” Mehta said. “We are also working on the mental components of our games so that we are able to perform in high pressure situations.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The stage was set for a breakthrough weekend for the Harvard women’s tennis team. After an unconvincing start to this season’s campaign after dropping the first two decisions of the 2016 season, the Crimson headed to Hanover to compete indoors at the 3 day ECAC tournament.
The Crimson faced off against no. 43 Princeton in the first round and sent a message to the competition with a strong performance to upstage the second seed in the tournament 4-2. Waiting in the semi finals was Brown. Harvard once against came out victorious, albeit in more dramatic fashion, with sophomore Annika Ringblom clinching the win in game seven for a berth in the final.
The successful run came to an end for Ringblom and co. who would eventually fall to Columbia 4-2, but the weekend was a productive one.
For the last few weeks, the Crimson have often put themselves in the hole early on, with losses in the doubles matchups. But on Friday and then Saturday, Harvard found itself in unfamiliar territory, the team won both doubles contests to give itself a lead of 1-0 going into the six singles matches.
Sophomore Nikki Kallenberg and freshman Siabel Jasper showed their steel in the match up Sunday. They teamed up to trounce the Tigers, 6-2, and more importantly gave Harvard a 1-0 lead.
Against Brown, Kallenberg and Jasper once again settled a doubles win after Harvard initially fell down 1-0.
“It was huge for us to win the doubles points the first two matches because we have been working hard on doubles so it was good to see results and it gave us confidence that we are doing the right thing and it makes singles a little easier,” junior June Lee said.
Without the added pressure of having to make up points in singles, the Crimson showed its resilienceclass, then grit, in victories over Princeton and Brown.
Up 3-2 in matches against the heavily favored Tigers, senior Amy He thwarted any chance of a possible revival with a stylish performance against Princeton’s Emily Hahn,6-4, 5-7, 6-0.
The script changed against a strong Brown squad. After gaining the lead from doubles play the Crimson entertained the Bears in what was an agonizingly close singles competition.
The first two matches went to Brown, Lee and Kallenberg were both beaten in straight sets. The 1-0 lead had turned into a 2-1 uphill battle. Oosterhout and He kept their nerves and push the Crimson back into the lead 3-2. But again there was a change with the Bear’s Maddie Stern coming in the clutch to force a game 7.
Ringblom faced off against Katie Ta and managed to fend off an all out Brown comeback in an impressive performance from the sophomore. She would win 6-4, 6-7 (4), 6-3.
The victory sent Harvard to the finals.
Because of a technical issue, the Crimson did not know who would be its opponent until late morning on Sunday. Dartmouth wasere eventually beaten by Columbia, Harvard’s final hurdle.
Although Columbia had played earlier, its team came out fast in doubles and gained the advantage in a close third match.
With a loss in doubles, Harvard entered singles play down 1-0. Xiong and He both won in straight sets, but could do little as the Crimson slipped to a 4-2 loss.
“We are extremely happy with our performance this weekend and know that we still have the room the grow as a team before our Ivy matches in April,” Ringblom said. “Overall, this weekend was just a little glimpse into hopefully a very successful season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Playing its last regular season home game of the year in front of a raucous home crowd for Senior Night at Bright-Landry Hockey Center, the Harvard women’s ice hockey team (13-9-2, 10-6-2 ECAC) picked up a victory over ECAC and Ivy rival Yale (10-14-1, 9-8-1) by a 4-1 margin.
“We were ready to go right off the bat.” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “I thought it was a pretty great atmosphere, awesome intensity in the building. We made a few adjustments from last night to today…. We took 42 shots but we took some really good shots.”
The Crimson outshot the Bulldogs by a 42-24 margin and co-captain Emerance Maschmeyer picked up the victory while making 23 saves in between the sticks. The performance was a solid bounce back for the senior in her first start since being pulled after the first period of the Beanpot semis.
“Having this game, they had a few good chances so I can’t complain about that,” Maschmeyer said. “It was huge coming off of the loss on Tuesday in the Beanpot…. Today we needed the win to get confidence heading into these next few weekends.”
Sophomore Chelsea Ziadie opened the scoring for the Crimson at the 4:15 mark, as the blueliner sent a rocket from the slot past Yale goaltender Hanna Mandl to score her first-career goal. Classmate Karly Heffernan and junior Sydney Daniels picked up the assists.
Harvard held on to the lead until Eli forward Phoebe Staenz’s individual effort evened the score for Yale. After gaining control of the puck in the neutral zone, the junior streaked down the right side before crossing in front of Harvard co-captain Emerance Maschmeyer and sending a backhand into the mesh.
After being tied at one apiece going into the second stanza, it once again took less than five minutes from the beginning of the frame for the Crimson to find the back of the net, albeit via a recently unlikely source. After Yale’s Jordan Chancellor was sent to the box for an interference penalty, it took all of ten seconds for Harvard to capitalize as rookie Nikki Friesen scored her first-career goal and set off the siren from just outside the crease.
The Crimson looked impressive on both ends of the power play after struggling with the man advantage the night before.
Prior to Friesen’s tally, Harvard had failed to convert its previous 25 penalty opportunities since a power play score against Cornell on Jan. 8. On the other end, the Crimson killed a slashing penalty on Heffernan to shut down Yale’s only penalty chance of the game after failing to kill the game-tying penalty the night before against Brown.
“We went back to simplifying, really defining people’s roles without freelancing a lot and trying to get a big shot presence from our point and we did that,” Stone said. “You hope they work and they worked for us today.”
The Harvard lead doubled later in the frame, as sloppy play from Mandl allowed Heffernan to bang in her sixth goal of the season. D’Oench sent a rocket from the left at Mandl, who failed to control the puck, allowing it to fall to Heffernan for the goal.
Yale continued to pressure the Crimson and looked to have pulled one back late in the third frame, as a stray shot nearly made its way into the mesh before Maschmeyer’s skates prevented it from going in. After review, the referees confirmed the shot had been failed to make it past the line.
Shortly after the save, Heffernan picked up her second goal of the night as the Sherwood Park, Alberta native bagged an empty netter after Mandl was pulled by Yale coach Joakim Flygh in an attempt to get a goal back. D’Oench was credited with her second assist of the night.
“Playing with Miye and [Sydney] it’s pretty easy.” Heffernan said. “They get pucks to the net and I just go to the net and I happened to be there when Miye shot the puck and on the last one, Miye chipped it into the zone and it was an open goal so I just went for it.”
After the game, the Crimson celebrated an impressive senior class comprised of Maschmeyer, D’Oench, co-captain Michelle Picard, Mary Parker, and Jessica Harvey. While the Class of 2016 was honored in its final home game of the regular season, Stone insists the members will be back in Bright-Landry as the Crimson battles for ECAC playoff home ice.
“We’ve got a lot of hockey,” Stone said. “Our seniors have been great and obviously some have made an incredible impact on the program. We’re just going to try and play as much hockey as we can down the stretch and get as far as we can in the playoffs and play for them. That’s what you do at this stretch of the season."

After the E. Coli and Salmonella outbreaks, Chipotle has realized it needs to pull its act together.  All of its stores will be closed for lunch on Monday for a company-wide meeting about food safety. But fear not, the burrito chain will reopen at 3 p.m., and they’ll be offering free burritos this week to anyone who texts “RAINCHECK” to 888-222. (Read: Chipotle needs to remind people how much they love Chipotle by bribing them.)
Clearly, Chipotle has been keeping up with Mankiw’s book. After all, everyone knows that one of the Ten Principles of Economics is that “People respond to incentives.” But make sure you hop on this opportunity ASAP, because the website reads: “Offer available between 11:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on Feb. 8, 2016, subject to change in Sponsor's sole discretion. Quantities are limited and offer is first come, first served, subject to availability.”
Upon texting the keyword, Chipotle will reply within a few days with a coupon for a free burrito. If you’re like us, and you’ve been eating at Chipotle despite the horror stories of disease spreading around their chain, this is great news for you. You can continue to fuel your addiction, but now without the downsides of draining your bank account and then disappointing your parents when you ask to borrow money.
Even if you’re a bit weaker and slightly less courageous, and you’ve been abstaining from the delicious goodness of Chipotle, you’re still a college student. Free food is free food, regardless of whatever microscopic pathogens come along with it. Besides, Chipotle had a Skype sesh with all of its employees during lunch to talk about food safety, remember? Clearly the problem is resolved.
Still not convinced? Based on the amount of money Chipotle lost as a result of no one wanting to eat contagion-burritos, we’re hoping that food safety now qualifies as a worthy investment. We suppose the answer will be clear this week, when everyone gorges themselves on free burritos… So, text away, and may the E. Coli odds be ever in your favor.

A wise man once said “Pizza is a major key”, and he wasn’t lying. If you’re anything like us, pizza of questionable quality in your home town was a staple that you consumed more often than you’d like to admit. Then you got to college and the Freshman 15 quickly evolved into the Freshman 30 as you scarfed down late-night boxes from ‘Noch’s and slices from Otto’s.
Depending on what corner of the world you hail from, pizza could mean something completely different to you than it does to others. Take the divisive deep dish vs. thin crust rivalry, for instance. For me, the dough is the key - for others, the sauce can be an instant deal breaker. There are a ton of pizza shops in the square that claim to be the best store in town. Ever the fact-checking journalist, Flyby's Brandon Dixon went to investigate (at serious detriment to his waist size).
Ottos
Otto’s is an acquired taste, hinging mostly on what type of dough you love. Thin-crust lovers will devour box after box of this Portland-brand pizza, if they can get over the odd, grilled  after-taste that Otto’s brand of cooking produces. The only thing Otto’s is missing is a significant side menu; seriously, I crave cheese fries with every slice of pizza I eat. Shout-out to their Ricotta and Basil pizza; many have tried to get that combination right and, like sophomores slugging through Orgo, many have failed.
Pinocchio's
Pinocchio’s is one of those Harvard staples whose reputation is carried by how integral it is to the Harvard experience. Honestly, their pizza is not the best, but it’s highly edible -- especially after midnight. They get major props for the disclaimer on their website: “Please note that when the undergraduate students are not in session we close on Friday and Saturday night at 1:00 am instead of 2:30 am”, which shows just how well they understand the audience that they serve. Still, their pizza slices are unnecessarily greasy, which is why I recommend buying only a couple slices at a time. PSA: do not try to pay with a credit card. They’ve got one of those weird thresholds where you have to spend an outrageous amount of money in order to do so. It’s the perfect trap for a cash-less drunk freshman who desperately needs a slice.
Just Crust
This was a little gem that I stumbled into one afternoon because I happened to be walking back from the rear of the Radcliffe Quadrangle. Again, the secret to their success is delicious thin-crust style pizza. Plus, their slices are humongous -- perfect if you ever want to throw a dorm debate-watch party, and you don’t want to order from dominos.  Try their Margherita Pizza -- it’s legendary.
Dominos
Speaking of dominos, I hate to say it, but they have very little going for them. Sure, they’re an American staple, but they fall prey to all of the failures of chain pizza stores. Their pizza doesn’t have a distinctive taste and can sometimes taste just plain nasty. Also, the service: I ordered cheesy bread sticks the other day and didn’t receive any dipping sauce (I paid for three). Seriously the most disappointing thing that’s happened to me since I saw my semester one Ec10 grade.
HUDS
Thank you, Harvard Square, for giving hungry college kids the pizza selection we deserve.
