After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
 
As someone who studies science but reads for my own enjoyment, I don’t normally see my academic life intruding upon my leisure. Which is not to say that the two are incompatible— but the prevailing notion seems to be that the sciences and the arts are best kept distinct. E. L. Doctorow, however, cares little for this division in his twelfth novel, the frankly titled “Andrew’s Brain.” Doctorow, who has previously tackled historical terrain in “Ragtime” and “The Book of Daniel,” focuses in “Andrew’s Brain” on the titular cognitive scientist, who uses his scientific background to color the life story he relates. This setup could easily produce a hokey, awkward attempt to inject additional profundity into his work by means of complex terminology and obscure references; instead, the novel becomes poetic proof of the artistry inherent in the pursuit of science.
 It is obvious that, in order to write “Andrew’s Brain,” Doctorow has done his research. As Andrew relates his tale to a skeptical therapist, he explores real questions of modern neuroscience; at one point, he speaks of “the despair” of what he studies. “You’ve got to be brave when you do science. I reacted badly to the publication of an experiment demonstrating that the brain can come to a decision seconds before we’re conscious of it.” The experiment Doctorow describes is genuine—it is considered a seminal neurobiological study and has had a profound impact on the field. For this reason, his depiction of Andrew’s response—the “despair” associated with such results—becomes a moving statement of the philosophical and emotional implications of science. 
 Andrew himself makes such connections explicit: Doctorow casts him in the role of a teacher, where he can simultaneously expound to his students and the readers how he interprets his field. He describes the conundrum of what the brain would be in the absence of sensation as “the depthless dingledom of your own soul,” and intersperses such abstract descriptions in his lectures with abstractions on the beauty of the student with whom he ultimately falls in love. In this fashion, Doctorow makes two elements that could easily be dull and mundane themselves—the professor’s lectures and his love affair with his student—a beautifully expressed  facet of his novel’s overarching accomplishment.
 But what is most clever about “Andrew’s Brain” is the various levels on which Doctorow is able to express Andrew’s (and presumably his own) conception of art and science. As the novel continues, Andrew’s narration falls increasingly into doubt until one finally discovers that some of the more unrealistic events he relates, events the therapist calls into question, could not possibly have occurred based on the novel’s timeline. One is then left with the potentially uncomfortable conclusion that they must have taken place merely in Andrew’s own brain, as the title suggests, and so the entirety of the novel is cast into doubt. But the novel itself addresses the issues of experience, consciousness, and sensation in such a compelling way that perhaps, one thinks, it doesn’t matter if the novel is imagined. Near its conclusion, Andrew asks his therapist if he is the “first computer invested with consciousness? With terrible dreams, with feelings, with grief, with longing?” The therapist, eternally Andrew’s skeptic, rejects the idea immediately, but based on Doctorow’s prior exploration of the subjectivity of experience one cannot fully agree with him. And because, here as elsewhere, Doctorow so clearly expresses the artistic side of science, one cannot say that the novel would be cheapened in any way were Andrew in fact only the simulation of a mind.
 In a short 200 pages Doctorow manages to probe territory previously unexplored, perhaps because writers and scientists are often distinct populations. Thus the creative and literary implications of neuroscientific and psychological ideas—of the lack of free will, of the Prisoner’s Dilemma, of artificial intelligence—are denied entrance into the world where they could perhaps find the most meaning. The scientific has profound implications for the literary, and vice versa, and “Andrew’s Brain” is a decided testament to the arbitrary and even harmful nature of a strict division of those fields. For only a writer of Doctorow’s skill could remind us that neuroscience is not simply about manipulating cells and organs, but about attempting to discover “how that three-pound knitting ball makes you feel like a human being.”

Academy Award-winning actress Helen Mirren, known for her on-stage and on-screen portrayals of British queens, among other roles, has been named the 2014 Hasty Pudding Theatricals' Woman of the Year.
Initially a stage actress based in England, Mirren has performed in over 75 film and television roles. She received damehood in 2003 for excellence in the arts and won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance as Queen Elizabeth II in the 2006 film The Queen.
In a press release from the Hasty Pudding Theatricals, the Harvard-based organization that presents the annual award, Mirren said that she thought her selection as Woman of the Year was “very saucy.”
“As someone who adores Pudding in all its manifestations...Suet, Christmas, Treacle, Bread and Butter, Yorkshire, Plum, Figgy, etc., etc., I am so looking forward to the famous Hasty Pudding,” Mirren said in the release.
President of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals Tony T. Oblen ’14 said in the press release that members of the organization were pleased to honor Mirren with the award.
“We look forward to welcoming Ms. Mirren and celebrating and honoring her achievements in a truly unique and memorable way,” he said.
Mirren will be honored with a parade through Cambridge and a subsequent celebratory roast on Jan. 30. Following the roast, Mirren will receive her ceremonial “Pudding Pot” at Farkas Hall.
Established in 1951, the Woman of the Year Award is the Hasty Pudding’s oldest accolade. With her new honor, Mirren joins the ranks of esteemed performers including Ella Fitzgerald, Jodie Foster, and Meryl Streep.
In its press release, Hasty Pudding Theatricals stated that it would announce the recipient of its Man of the Year Award at a later date and will honor him on Feb. 7.

Sophomore forward Jimmy Vesey was nominated for the Hobey Baker Award, which was first commissioned in 1981 to recognize the nation’s most outstanding NCAA men’s ice hockey player. The namesake of the award, Hobey Baker, served in World War I and played ice hockey collegiately at Princeton.
Fans are able to contribute to the voting process through two phases. The first round of voting narrows down the field to 10 nominees and ends on March 9. The next and final phase of voting begins March 20 and ends before April 11, when the winner will be announced at the NCAA Frozen Four in Philadelphia. Fans are able to vote every 24 hours, and fan votes account for 1 percent of the total voting process.
Last year’s Ivy League Rookie of the Year has had a fast start in his sophomore campaign. Vesey leads the Crimson in goals and points on the season, with 10 and 14, respectively. Vesey has provided the game-winning goal in three of the team’s five wins this season thus far. The sophomore has also added four assists on the year and has registered a positive goal differential, despite Harvard’s losing record.
Vesey has also managed to stay healthy through the team’s 16 games this season. The second year player dealt with an injury for the latter part of last year’s season.
Vesey would be the first Crimson player to win this award since 1989, when  left wing Lane MacDonald captured the award. The only other Harvard stars to receive this honor were Mark and Scott Fusco, a pair of brothers who did so in 1983 and 1986, respectively.
