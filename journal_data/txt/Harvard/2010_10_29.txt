After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sometimes it’s hard to believe that in America the separation between church and state is as black and white as blue and red. Yet a recent survey conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute has found that attitudes toward gay marriage are changing: From 2008 to 2010 there was an eight percent increase—from 29 percent to 37 percent—in support for gay marriage across religious groups. Furthermore, relative to those who changed positions, gay marriage gained three supporters for every new opponent, and the study found the most movement among Catholics. Yet the Christian Church is certainly not changing its standpoint on gay marriage: With the release of the Manhattan Declaration in November 2009, Orthodox, Evangelical, and Catholic Christians created a veritable manifesto deeming gay marriage “a loss of the understanding of the meaning of marriage” and one of the three most pressing concerns in our society today.  Unfortunately for the Manhattanites, the fact that no Evangelicals under 40 initially signed the Declaration symbolizes the group’s greatest problem. The generation gap is pushing the priorities of younger Americans farther and farther away from those of older generations with regard to homosexuality.
The PRRI study found that 75 percent of Americans aged 18 to 29 support gay marriage or civil unions, in stark contrast to the just 51 percent of Americans 65 and older. And according to Dan Cox, the Director of Research at PRRI, the data indicate that “nearly two-thirds of Americans under 30 say that one of the biggest problems in the country is that not everyone is given an equal chance in life,” versus “less than half of adults 65 and older.” Initiatives like the Manhattan Declaration do not seem to be bridging the generation divide; they do not encourage discussion and youth involvement but rather make broad appeals with unequivocal labels such as “A Call to Christian Conscience,”
What galvanizes this generation is movement and lateral communication, specifically through the Internet. The lateral and interlocking function of the Internet is perhaps the most insurmountable distance for the elder generation to cross. I’m not saying that older people don’t know how to use the Internet, or even that all young people use it as much as we’re accused. Rather, it is the difference between a native speaker of a language and someone who learns it in school: The Internet is a resource and a refuge for our generation in a way that feels natural and organic rather than applied. As a sphere, the Internet can be as private or as public as the user needs it to be. It becomes a space where people can explore identities, probe taboos, and answer questions on their own, seeking the advice and experience of others as anonymously or vocally as they want.
The implications for LGBT youth, then, spread as quickly as the gap between the priorities of younger and older Americans. And as Robert Jones of PRRI notes, the more our social networks fill with LGBT friends, the more it matters to us that they have access to the same rights as everyone else. Anyone who regularly sifts through Facebook “Page” and “Cause” solicitations knows this to be true. The recent tragedies of Tyler Clementi and others reverberate through these networks, perturbing anyone with a familiar stake in the matter far more deeply than someone outside this social network.
In such a context, it is easy to see how the older generation of discussion dominators are falling behind on the gay marriage issue. How could the vertical nature of edicts such as the Manhattan Declaration appeal to a laterally oriented generation? How could such a statement trump the constant viral network of exchange, support, and discussion? What better suits our generation is interactive projects such as “It Gets Better,” a LGBT support website created in September 2010 as a “video archive to share the stories of people overcoming bullying and finding happiness.” The traditional churches could never have made this website, and this is their problem.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
News about the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico used to be everywhere. For months, it was impossible to open a newspaper or turn on the television without seeing a picture of an oil-covered pelican or a photo of black plumes gushing from an underwater vent. But as soon as the leaking oil well in the Gulf was plugged in September, the story dropped off the national news faster than a sinking rig.
Of course, the Gulf is still reeling from the damage. Just last weekend, miles-long stretches of weathered oil were found floating off of the coast of Louisiana, threatening the closure of fisheries that had just been reopened. However, without as many visible signs of damage, the American public has moved on, devoting its limited cognitive energy to more pressing issues like the rescue of the Chilean miners or NPR commentators who get nervous when flying with Muslims. The few public opinion polls that even contain questions about the oil spill have found that concern about the spill pales in comparison to the economy, budget issues, or health care reform.
Few of the campaigns for 2010 outside of the affected region along the gulf coast have even mentioned the spill, its cleanup, or offshore oil drilling in general. Although spending on campaign advertising has reached a record high this fall, the content seems much more focused on trade relations with China, illegal immigration and abortions than the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history.
When the new BP CEO, Robert “Bob” Dudley, blamed the media on Monday for creating a “climate of fear” in its coverage of the Gulf Coast spill, hardly anyone noticed. Compare that to the outcry when the former BP CEO was caught saying things like, “I want my life back.”
Even legitimate reports about the progress of the cleanup often cite confusing or contradictory findings. Fishermen in the region say that they have been seeing oily patches for days, contradicting claims by Coast Guard scientists that very little oil from the spill remained in the gulf, either on the surface or on the ocean floor.
It’s unlikely that the Coast Guard is trying to hoodwink the public. Tests conducted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on samples of both water and soil at various depths and distances from the coast found low levels of contaminants. But we don’t have good ways of knowing where the oil is, how much is left, and how it is affecting. Therein lies part of the problem: It is easy to get worked up by quotable figures, like barrels of oil leaking per day, but hearing scientists say “we just don’t know” isn’t enough to send cable news commentators into a spasm of righteous indignation.
Gulf publicity has suffered from the decrease in visibility of oil-covered birds, but that doesn’t mean that the birds are free from harm. Birds who ingest oil can suffer from ulcers, pneumonia, or liver damage, and eating contaminated food can adversely affect their ability to breed and take care of their young. In addition, reduced food supplies due to effects elsewhere in the food chain can push some avian populations that are already endangered to the tipping point.
Hearing about damage to big animals, like turtles, birds, and dolphins, touches our hearts more than plants, invertebrates, or microbes, but damage to habitat and animals low on the food chain contains the greater risk and the greater uncertainty. For instance, oil is hard to remove from the soils of estuaries and marshes, and it does the most damage by preventing marsh grass from growing. The grass is an important food source and provides cover for small animals, and having less grass will contribute to erosion. But we don’t know how reduced estuary land will affect the region over long periods of time.
The oil has also likely damaged ecological systems that we have yet to discover. The ocean remains a largely unexplored frontier, and new species and ecosystems are found every year. Undiscovered species may someday prove to have medicinal or agricultural value, and we would be robbing ourselves of future advances if we allowed these organisms to go extinct.
As responsible citizens, we must finish the cleanup and take steps to prevent another spill from happening. The only reliable way to ensure a natural disaster on this scale does not occur again is to end offshore oil drilling, especially on deepwater rigs, and minimize large oil shipments across the open ocean. Tougher regulations and enforcement will not change the fact that any machine or vessel built by human hands may someday break or malfunction in unforeseen ways. Until then, the best we can do is to remind the public that while the leak is plugged, the damage remains.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four Loko, the alcoholic energy drink quickly gaining popularity among college students, is under the national spotlight after last week’s incident at Central Washington University, in which several students were treated for dangerously high blood alcohol levels after consuming the drink. While some concerned lawmakers and school administrators have sought to ban the beverage, we believe that this approach incorrectly places the onus on authority figures to correct student behavior. While there should be increased education to raise awareness of Four Loko’s effects, ultimately students must take responsibility for their own drinking habits.
To this end, schools should ensure that students are prepared for the  drinking cultures prevalent on college campuses. Considering the occurrence at Central Washington University in which all nine hospitalized patients were freshmen, we believe that an emphasis should be placed on educating first-year students about the dangers of excessive drinking. Those just entering the college environment are least prepared for and most susceptible to potentially life-threatening habits. While the burden is on students to drink responsibly, this requires both support from the institutional level as well as conscientiousness among students themselves. Schools can help freshmen acquire this awareness as early as possible.
The Food and Drug Administration must also take initiative. The agency should mandate that all caffeinated alcoholic drinks bear a label explaining the physiological effects of this combination. In the absence of a disclaimer on the can, students can easily drink without understanding the amount of alcohol they are consuming. Four Loko is particularly disarming, as its uncanny resemblance to energy drinks could lead students to underestimate its alcohol content. The truth about these drinks must be made explicitly clear, and thus the FDA should take a role in disseminating this information.
The growing popularity of Four Loko is linked to its attractively low price. With the alcohol content of roughly five beers in each can, it is not surprising that students are drawn to the Four Loko craze, which has swept through college campuses across the nation. We recognize the unique appeal of such cheap modes of intoxication to young adults with limited budgets; for this reason, public awareness and explicit labeling is especially crucial.
When imbibed safely and responsibly, Four Loko is a perfectly reasonable product. So long as students recognize the amount of alcohol and caffeine they are consuming, there appears to be little justification for an outright ban. Four Loko is not solely to blame for the unsafe practices of college students. Instead of targeting the product itself, emphasis should be placed on individuals to remedy their risky drinking habits.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Oct. 8, word came from Oslo that this year’s Nobel Peace Prize went to Dr. Liu Xiaobo, a Chinese dissident currently incarcerated by his government, who has been in and out of jail since his participation in the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989. Liu was stripped of all political rights by his government, and he likely has no idea that he was named a laureate. The award will reenergize and further legitimize the struggle against human rights violations in the world’s most populous country. His cause, therefore, deserves more than the handful of media cycles that it received right after the announcement with the talking heads weighing in briefly and moving on.
The Nobel Committee has taken a strong turn in tone since bestowing last year’s award upon President Barack Obama, then a fledgling and overexposed actor on the world stage with two wars and an Afghan troop escalation under his belt. In honoring Liu, the Nobel Committee has returned to its cause of developing peace and justice and supporting those who suffer in the pursuit of them. The Nobel Peace Prize is among the highest honors a person can receive, and it is a symbol of moral righteousness and legitimacy. Perhaps even more importantly, though, it is the world’s largest spotlight, a chance to draw attention to and catalyze dialogue about a cause.
Oslo is at its most effective when it is using the Nobel Prize to draw attention to important causes and injustices that could otherwise fall through the cracks. Last year’s honoring of Obama was a misguided ploy to celebrate a politician and try to influence the direction of geopolitical relations by publicly pressuring the sitting president of the only remaining superpower. President Obama was the first to tell us that he had no business winning the Peace Prize. His body of work had barely begun, and he inherited two wars in which we were hopelessly entangled. The award drew widespread criticism from all corners and forced the president to accept an award in spite of the irony of awarding a peace prize to a wartime president. Unlike Liu, Obama’s cause needed no extra spotlight.
Liu is certainly deserving of his award.  He is a poet and literary critic who was a professor at Beijing Normal University when the Tiananmen Square student protests marked a boiling point in Chinese civil discontent. He was staunchly non-violent and probably prevented further violence during the demonstrations. As a political dissident, he is currently serving his fourth stint in jail, this one an 11-year sentence for spreading subversive writing. His crime was supporting the Charter 08 movement, which called for greater human rights, freedom of expression, and free elections. The Chinese government quickly arrested him and sentenced him to 11 years in prison after a two-year trial.
In his letter nominating Liu for the award, Princeton Professor Kwame Appiah quoted Nobel laureate Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.: “For an intellectual thirsty for freedom in a dictatorial country, prison is the very first threshold. Now I have stepped over the threshold, and freedom is near.”
Another Nobel Peace Prize recipient, Aung San Suu Kyi of Myanmar, was imprisoned by her own government for dissidence in 1991 when she was honored. Her opposition party, National League for Democracy, had taken the majority in Parliament the year before, but she was placed under house arrest. Since then, she has spent 14 of the past 20 years under house arrest. An international campaign for her release has pressured the Burmese government to announce her release next month, when she will be able to organize her party. Her Nobel Prize surely helped keep the international focus on facilitating her release, and hopefully Liu’s will serve a similar purpose.
The Chinese government is infuriated by the award. They have blocked all CNN and BBC reports of the announcement and ramped up internet censorship of sites pertaining to Liu. They have even stated that this could deteriorate Sino-Norwegian relations. Even if Liu does not know of all that is going on in his name, he would surely be proud of the completely non-violent way in which the world is focusing on and condemning Chinese civil rights abuses. His award can serve to draw further worldwide attention and scorn to the oppressive government that imprisons him.

THE CRIB
A contemporary home, built in the 1950s. Two stories. Three bedrooms, three bathrooms.
Location: Cambridge, Mass.
Price: Undisclosed.
Dershowitz shares his home with his wife, Carolyn Cohen, a psychologist and supervisor at Harvard Medical School. The couple bought their West Cambridge abode from Nobel-Prize-winning biologist David Baltimore, and they count Yo-Yo Ma ’76 as a neighbor.
However, the professor hasn’t let all of this get to his head. He still walks to work, and revels in inviting students to his house. “It’s important to live in the neighborhood,” he says. “When Harvard sold its houses in Cambridge, it relegated most professors to the suburbs—the most idiotic decision among the university’s many idiotic decisions. It’s devastating to the community.”
Dershowitz and Cohen managed to stay in Cambridge, and their low blue house is set back from the street, partially obscured by hedges and trees. The inside is as striking as the outside is unobtrusive.
THE ENTRANCE
When the door opens, the first thing that may catch your eye is a crouching man perched on the edge of a pedestal. The modern sculpture, found at a gallery in Brooklyn, is flanked by a vaguely totem pole-like antique drum, and a large stone Chinese warrior who sits guarding three dinosaur eggs. Next to it is a 4,000-year-old sarcophagus wearing a yarmulke made of Coca-Cola cans.
The walls are covered in art, including Dershowitz’s first purchase, an original Kandinsky. Dershowitz bought it for $25 on a Harvard Law School funded trip to Paris in 1965, and has been amassing art ever since. His love of art started earlier, when he was in school—sort of.  “I was a very bad high school student, so when I got suspended, which happened often, I would go to museums,” he explains. Clearly, the suspensions didn’t hold him too far back.
Dershowitz and Cohen have lived in their home for almost 20 years. Fortunately for them, their tastes mostly agree. “There’s a huge overlap in our Venn diagram, but we have some differences,” explains Cohen. “For instance, Alan tends to like rabbis. I also enjoy Judaic art, but there’s not the same nostalgia for the past—I’m from South Carolina, not Brooklyn.”
THE LIVING ROOM
Though the living room’s walls are bright blue and red, it is almost impossible to see them. “It would take me 10 hours to go through everything in this room,” Dershowitz says. He’s not exaggerating. One of the walls features built-in display cases that hold antiquities and other priceless objects Dershowitz describes collectively as “tchotchkes.” Another wall houses a small Chagall, among other paintings. “I got a great bargain on that one,” Dershowitz brags. “It was for sale at a Jewish auction, but it has a crucifix in it—no one else wanted it.”
On the floor lays a black rug designed by Cohen herself to incorporate elements of the art in the room. Nearby sits a Coney Island bumper car and a sofa made out of the hood of a Cadillac. On a small couch sits a lifelike doll of an old woman, a craft market find. “Some people think it looks a little bit like my mother. But I like it because it always scares people when they first come in,” Dershowitz says. “They always think it’s real for the first minute.”  FM is guilty as charged.
On a small wall separating the living room from the hallway, set apart from many of the other pieces, is a framed letter on the importance of free speech written by Thomas Jefferson. Discovered tucked in a book owned by the letter’s recipient, Dershowitz, with his notorious penchant for indulging this particular right, found it so significant that he’s written a book about it: “Finding, Framing, and Hanging Jefferson.”
DOWNSTAIRS
Blank walls do not exist in the Dershowitz house. The hallway at the base of the stairs displays Dershowitz’s collection of presidential signatures from every US president except Obama. Instead, Dershowitz has a business card on which Obama has handwritten his home address and phone number, pre-White House, tucked into one of the frames. “Some of them are specifically to me—obviously not Washington or Lincoln. Oh, and here’s a picture of Bill and me in synagogue,” he explains, pointing nonchalantly to the 42nd President, among various other Oval Office correspondences on the walls.
THE OFFICE
The stairs take us to the master bedroom and the couple’s home offices. “We keep some of our favorite pieces in the bedroom,” Dershowitz says.  “A couple Picassos, a Magritte, Modigliani, things like that.”
While the bedroom is uncluttered, Dershowitz’s office is just the opposite. Books, papers and frames are stacked in piles around the floor and on the desk, which spans two walls. On one wall is Warhol’s “Electric Chair,” a work Cohen deems too disturbing for shared living space. Next to it is a set of what Dershowitz calls “Me and whoever pictures.” He points to a smaller one. “Here’s one of my proudest pictures,” he says. “It’s of me getting arrested in Switzerland for confronting Ahmadinejad.”
In a display case, Dershowitz keeps some of his most prized rare books, including the earliest publication of the Declaration of Independence. A signed VHS copy of “O.J. Simpson: The Interview” sits on the same shelf.
On another side of the room, a program from a 1954 basketball game at Madison Square Garden leans against the wall.  Avi Dershowitz, playing for his yeshiva before the Knicks came on for the main event, guarded Ralph Lifschitz.  Today, Avi has become Alan, while Lifschitz has turned into Lauren. Next to it, in the middle of a pile of papers is a Fenway Park menu, including the “Dershowitz” pastrami sandwich.  Though he was born in Brooklyn, Dershowitz is a proud member of Red Sox Nation.  Picking up an 1865 plate used to make lithographs of Lincoln, Dershowitz declares, “In here, it’s just my junk.”
And what will happen to this “junk” if they ever move?
“I’m planning to retire in five years, and we won’t need this big house,” says Dershowitz.  “All I can say is that a lot of museum directors are going to be very happy.” Mazel tov.
CORRECTION: November 2, 2010.  An earlier version of the Oct. 29 magazine article "FM Cribs: Alan M. Dershowitz" incorrectly stated that Dershowitz's middle initial is C. The article also stated that David Baltimore is a physicist. Baltimore is a biologist.

Earlier this year, my sister sent me the YouTube video “Gingers Do Have Souls.” In a battle cry for the ginger cause, a ginger gentleman named “CopperCab” gives a three-minute monologue affirming that redheads are human too. While his passion and brutal haircut were absolutely hilarious, there was something true behind his words to which all gingers could relate.
Teased as a little ginger, I denied the pride that this man expresses. The denial went so far that until recently I insisted, “No, my hair is not red—it’s auburn,” as if there were even a difference.
I was born in September 1990 into a family that would eventually consist of two blondes­—my younger sister and mother—and a brunette—my father. I am the sole ginger of the bunch. Although my parents claim that my middle name Rose is from that of a distant relative, the color parallel hardly seems coincidental. From the beginning, I was stuck with ginger-themed epithets. Born looking like the Pillsbury Doughboy with a tuft of orange hair, I earned the nickname Pumpkin.
Growing up, my parents instilled an affinity toward ginger items. Maybe it was a coincidence. Or was it? At age 7, I received a reddish-colored hamster named Buttons, and the current family pet is a 9-year-old ginger and white cat, Tinker. And today, my go-to horse on the polo team is, yes, a ginger. My parents, who taught me to be a foodie, fattened me up with gingered foods. I grew up on ginger snaps, gingerbread, ginger ale, candied ginger, Chinese stir-fry with ginger, and pickled ginger on sushi. At Harvard, I’ve expanded to Dark and Stormies as well as Crema Café’s ginger steamer.
Most people don’t know what it feels like to be a ginger. That’s because redheads make up somewhere between one and two percent of the world’s population. I, however, am one of those (lucky?) people. The idea of redness, orangeness, and “gingerness” is a constant factor in my life, and this is besides the fact that I’m stuck 24-7 with bright ginger hair. There are colors, people, nicknames, and cultural references that are attached to the ginger category.  Although I’ve had my own personal experiences, a certain perspective seems to tie gingers together.
Entire colors palettes are banned for us gingers. According to fashion magazines, we have to eliminate yellow, orange, and most shades of red from our wardrobes in order to avoid a style faux pas. The clash between red hair and these “hot” colors would be egregious. Just like someone shouldn’t wear green pants with a green shirt, a ginger should never wear a red shirt (or pants) with red hair.
There is also the one question that only gingers get asked, and too frequently for comfort. Home decorating is not a topic we like to discuss.
Once one gets past the childhood years and over the fact that orange dresses are not an option, it becomes apparent that the perks of gingerhood are pretty nice. For example, we have Ginger Spice, Thomas Jefferson, Conan O’Brien, and Miranda from “Sex and the City” on our side.
Gingers are also the object of their very own fetish. A female ginger must always ask herself: is that guy hitting on me because he likes me, or does he just have a ginger fetish?  This fetish is real and more common than one might expect.
Throughout the year, we gingers take advantage of our genetic rarity. We are always prepared for certain holidays and Harvard athletic events. If someone asks me why I am not wearing crimson at a football game, I most likely will point to my hair. Of course I’m prepared, my hair is crimson! There is also Christmas and Valentine’s Day, which gingers can effortlessly dress up for. On Fourth of July, gingers can just wear blue and white. The red is already taken care of. And what fire-headed ginger hasn’t been the devil at least once on Halloween?
For the past year, I have been experiencing the life of a (fake) blonde. Now, however, I’ve decided to grow out my roots and become the Pumpkin I once was.

I have to say this when initiating new dining companions. My friends, however, already know the drill.
No meal, no matter how beautifully plated (especially if it’s beautifully plated), is complete without an extensive photo shoot. I’ve been known to sharply reprimand errant dining partners who ruin the perfect photo of a chocolate-chip-heaped cannoli.
No, seriously—this is a sacred and inviolable ritual. First, I hold my iPhone to my forehead for the extra glow it imparts in a dimly lit dining room. Never mind that I look like a tech-brainwashed spelunker. Then I squint through the viewfinder on my DSLR camera and fiddle with the ISO and exposure settings. Then, and only then, I snap at least two or three photos, check, recalibrate, and give the plate a twirl to see if I can find a more flattering angle.
Uncooperative dining partners get axed from the rotation.
Since I began blogging nearly two years ago, no dinner goes by without this meticulously documented sequence of photos. Even the breadbasket (if it’s artful) gets a moment in the sun.
In the early days, I shot everything with a Nikon point-and-shoot. Then I got into a New York City taxicab over the summer and we parted ways. Mourning the loss of my most reliable dining companion (the only one who doesn’t flake, or balk at ordering intestines), I decided to bring out the big guns on the rebound.
I upgraded to a Canon Digital Rebel XS. Still entry-level, but now I had a real lens. In doing so, I realized that bringing an imposing camera to dinner confers a new level of geekiness. Waiters are more likely to ask you what you’re doing. People assume you’re either an overzealous tourist or a photojournalist.
And you can also reach a whole new level of annoying. When I discovered continuous shooting mode, my trigger-happy finger captured my sleep-deprived boss in a sequence of eating lunch: a spoon piercing the cheesy crust of French onion soup, scooping in, coming out again triumphant.
After all, I was determined to capture nothing less than the foodtography equivalent of an elusive pregnant Beyoncé photo: the ultimate paparazzi shot.
All this obsessive behavior has resulted in some basic rules of thumb in restaurant food photography. If you, too, would like to annoy the hell out of your friends at dinner, take my advice to heart:
1. Avoid flash if you can. It makes your lemon tart look like a washed-out heroin addict.
2. Set your camera on “macro” for a romantic blurred background when you’re focusing up close. Aww.
3. Try a variety of angles. Low, close angles are generally flattering. Don’t do the same to your BFF.
4. Ask to sit near a light or by a window, or just try going earlier in the day.
5. Fake it! Fix white balance by shooting in raw mode if possible, and then fix the colors in Photoshop.
6. Set your ISO to as high a setting as possible without getting graininess or “noise” in the image. Too low, and your image will be blurred.
7. When photographing dark-hued dishes like meat, focus on capturing a bright spray of color—like the parsley garnish.
8. Forbid your friends from eating anything while you snap away, cackling like a maniac.

When her boyfriend told her last November about a commercial for “Terriers,” Sanyee Yuan ’12 first thought of canines. Last Friday in Lowell House, in a pleasantly ironic turn of events, Yuan, in collaboration with the Office for the Arts, the Harvard University Television and Harvardwood, organized a screening of “Terriers,” the new comedic crime drama on the FX Network, and a talk with its stars Donal F. Logue ’88 and Michael Raymond-James.
The show, which premiered in September, centers on ex-cop Hank Dolworth (Logue) and his ex-crook partner Britt Pollack (Raymond-James) as they launch an unlicensed private investigation business.
“It’s a love child between ‘Ocean’s Eleven’ and  ‘The Shield,’” Logue said. “We wanted to create a show for people who hate the contrivances of television.”
“We fought to make it real for the audience,” Raymond-James added.
Despite stellar reviews, “Terriers” is facing dismal ratings, which prompted Logue and Raymond-James to hit the road on a publicity tour across college campuses. The Harvard stop has special meanings for Logue, who spent his undergraduate years in Adams House. A history concentrator, he nonetheless found his calling in the performing arts after participating in a theater production.
“The experience was like a drug,” Logue said. “I feel comfortable with the fact that I’m never going to wear a suit and sit in an office. But I’ve made a decision to live and work in the creative arts until I die.”
Logue’s decision startled his Irish immigrant parents but thrilled Claire Mallardi, former Director of the Harvard-Radcliffe Dance Program and Logue’s teacher in a 1988 course titled “Movement for Actors.” “He’s truly funny and I’ve always remembered him,” she said as they reunited in a poignant embrace.
As their parting words, Logue and Raymond-James encouraged students to find their passion in life. “Live for what you love,” Logue said.

A capital “M” is the widest letter in the alphabet. The letter “e” is the most common letter in English.
These are the kinds of things you discover when you learn to “divide language up into its pieces,” said Molly E. Dektar ’12, one of students learning to operate the Bow and Arrow Printing Press last week.
“This is a back-to-the-roots process,” says Rachael E. Levay. Though she is not a Harvard student, Levay—who works in book publishing—attended the introductory class in Adams House on Sunday. This week, she says, she learned to set type, ink and clean the presses, and printed note cards with her monogram.
The press, located in Adams, was first used in the 1950s. Every Thursday night from 7 to 10 p.m. the press is open for use.
“It’s been mothballed on and off,” says Adams non-resident tutor and former graphic designer Theodore “Ted” Ollier. “A House tutor usually finds it and opens it up and starts working it again.”
This time, the press is in the care of Ollier and Zachary C. Sifuentes ’97, resident poetry tutor of Adams. Together they have used the press as a crossroads between visual and literary art.
Enter the Bow and Arrow and you will be greeted by the smell of ink and antique presses that date back to the 1890s. The three presses still in use are from the 1920s, 30s, and 50s. But these aren’t the only historical treasures. Dektar, when prompted,  will excitedly bring out some old zinc press-plates as well. Some, like the delicate image of the Madonna and Child, were from a Boston monastery. Others, like a detailed depiction of two hands, and one of chemical powders in labeled jars, are a mystery.
But the best part about Bow and Arrow, according to Ollier, is the people involved. “This is a self-selected group of people,” he explains. “They tend to be interesting and a little odd in an endearing and fun way...I wouldn’t have it any different.”

Although Salem, Mass. is famous for its campaign to eliminate witches in 1692, the townspeople must not have been too successful. The witches’ modern counterparts can still be seen around town today during Halloween—although they are sporting the more stereotypical hooked noses, green faces, and pointy black hats. Salem boasts an extravaganza of activities for its visitors, from ghost tours to séances and costume balls. This tourist magnet that continues to attract the living (and, supposedly, the dead) is a must-see for at least one Halloween during your college career.
Events take place all month. Salem, Mass.
Ghosts and Gravestones Tour
Once you hop on the “Trolley of Doom,” there is no going back. The tour takes you throughout Boston to explore the city’s darker facets: century-old burying grounds, haunted hotels, and murder sites. Your ghoulish guide will tell you all about the city’ s most infamous citizens, from the Angel of Death to the Boston Strangler. Easily scared? Not to worry; the tour is more entertaining and humorous than spine-chilling. It’s pricey, but the money goes toward the noble cause of maintaining Boston’ s historical sites.
Saturday, Oct. 30, tours depart from 7-9 p.m. $38 per ticket ($34.30 if purchased online). Boards from 200 Atlantic Ave., Boston.
Hogwarts at the HMNH
We already knew that Annenberg is really the Great Hall, but the Harvard Museum of Natural History has taken our Hogwarts resemblance to the next level. This weekend, the HMNH is treating its visitors to a more practical class schedule, with offerings ranging from Magical Creatures to Potter’s Potions. So grab an owl (or squirrel), brandish your wand (or HUID), hop on your Nimbus 2000 (or the shuttle), and head to Hogwarts—er, the HNMH.
Friday, Oct. 30, 2-5 p.m. Free admission for Harvard students.
GoreFest VIII: “Cirque du Slaughté”
“Cirque du Slaughté” is what you get when you combine one of Boston’ s top-rated comedy clubs with Halloween: a show overflowing with satire, innuendo, and red corn syrup. Billed as the “number one slasher-comedy-gore-musical in the world,” GoreFest—now in its eighth year running—spins the tale of a Depression-era circus. If you would rather laugh than scream, this is the event for you. But be warned if you sit up front: “Don’t wear your good clothes; you might just get splattered.”
Saturday, Oct. 30, 8-9:30 p.m. $19 for students. ImprovBoston, 40 Prospect St., Cambridge
“The Rocky Horror Picture Show” 
One of the most iconic movies of the 1970s, “The Rocky Horror Picture Show” is infamous for its parody of science fiction and horror films. The film is a series of twists and turns that leaves many viewers praising it—even for an intentionally terrible film. From the scandalous leather outfits to the clever songs, “The Rocky Horror Picture Show” has made its mark as a piece of Hollywood film history and Halloween culture.
Friday, Oct. 29 and Saturday, Oct. 30, 12:01 a.m. $10 admission. AMC Loews Harvard Square 5, 10 Church St.
 
 
“Psycho” at Emerson College 
Even if you hate horror movies, “Psycho” is a classic. The brilliantly edited psychological thriller, which ushered in an era of horror and slasher films, sets the perfect mood for Halloween. On Friday and Saturday nights, Emerson College is screening the film at the Paramount Center’s Bright Family Screening Room. From master of mystery Alfred Hitchcock, “Psycho” will torture you with suspense and chill you to the core. Once you see it, you might never leave your bathroom door unlocked again.
Friday, Oct. 29, and Saturday, Oct. 30, 7 p.m. $10 admission. 559 Washington St., Boston.
The All New Scarier and More Interactive
2010 Boston Ghost Cruise
If Halloween on land is not scary enough for you, maybe taking it to the water will help on the Boston Ghost Cruise. Aboard the cruise, strange characters narrate tales of terror while the boat steers toward the sites where they occurred. Whether you find yourself shivering from the blood-curdling stories or amused by the personas of the narrators, you will probably come off the boat with an experience to share.
Friday, Oct. 30 at 7:30 p.m. and Saturday, Oct. 31 at 7:30 and 9:30 p.m. $32 per ticket. Leaves from Long Wharf, Boston. Blue Line to Aquarium Station.
Trick-or-Treating
Contrary to popular belief, trick-or-treating is not just for children. Starving college students need candy, too. Luckily for you, Cambridge is considered one of the best neighborhoods in Boston to scour for candy. If you’ve never trick-or-treated before, this is the perfect opportunity to start. And if you’re a trick-or-treating veteran, why not continue the tradition?
Sunday, Oct. 31, after sundown.

Those venturing on late-night Berryline runs lately may have noticed the brand-new Dekey Tibetan Store, now open for business at 8 Bow St.
The store is easy to get to. Starting on Mass. Ave., turn onto Bow Street and look for the shop’s sign on the left. The sign’s rainbow-colored circular logo is a Gankyil, a traditional Buddhist symbol that the storeowner’s husband painted.
Step inside and take off your coat–the outdoor chill is held at bay by plenty of radiators. Light Tibetan music emanates from a nearby CD player, punctuated occasionally by the rumble of the T passing underground. The store’s owner is Tsering Dickey, a mild-mannered and friendly lady who can usually be found tidying up the store while humming along to the music.
“My kids got older,” she said, “and I didn’t want to look for a job, so I decided to open this store.” Dickey’s husband, Pasang Bachantsang, said they traveled to India and bought their merchandise wholesale, mainly from New Delhi.
Those underprepared for the upcoming winter may want to consider shopping at the Tibetan Store. From soft yak-wool shawls to cute, colorful bear-shaped hats woven by Tibetan refugees, the store’s inventory features a variety of practical goods.
And the prices? Alejandra Munguia, a customer, said the goods were cheaper than she found elsewhere. “It’s really good quality and a good price.”
Since the store is still new, business is unsteady. “It’ll maybe take one year to get established,” said Bachantsang.

The Challenge:
With All Hallows’ Eve around the corner and Salem an hour away by commuter rail, most of us will have to get our thrills and chills on campus. In the spirit of darkness and debauchery, FM has compiled a list of seven (and a half) of the creepiest places our quaint little brick-clad college has to offer. The challenge? Take a photo of yourself in costume at each of the listed locations this weekend and send them to fm@thecrimson.com. The best set of photos (as determined by a secret but totally objective judging process) will win you a $50 gift certificate to Russell House Tavern and a spot in next week’s issue.
 
1. The Adams Tunnels
Walk into any entryway in Adams and take the stairs down to the tunnel below, which was reportedly used by Adams students to move about the House without having to brave the cold. That’s great, but what do those creepy murals on the walls mean? What are they trying to cover up down there?
 
2. The Student Organization Center at Hilles (The SOCH)
If you’re feeling ambitious, shuttle to the Quad and explore literally anywhere in this building—it’s all spooky, particularly after dark. You might try the Penthouse “Coffee Bar,” if that’s really its function, or the SOCH Cinema downstairs. Even the students studying in the reading room on the ground floor are not to be trusted.
 
3. The Annenberg Balcony
Luckily, you don’t have to be a freshman to access the balcony. Or maybe it’s not so lucky, depending on what you find up there. Walk in the back, as if going into Sanders Theater, and take the elevator up to the balcony. Don’t be deceived by the happy, innocent freshman eating noisily below you. Something isn’t right there.
 
4. The Outside of The Lampoon Building
Located at 44 Bow St., near the intersection of Mt. Auburn Street. Any coulrophobics out there know what we’re talking about. This oddly narrow little building not only resembles a deranged clown, but is full of them.

5. Outside H-Entryway in Dunster House
It may have been 15 years since the infamous murder-suicide in this entryway, but the rumors of vengeful spirits still persist to the point that only tutors have lived in the suite of the incident ever since. 
6. The Middle of Cambridge Common
Have you seen this place at night? It doesn’t have to be Halloween for you to feel scared for your life as you pass through after dark. We’re pretty sure the Common has something to do with why Harvard was recently named the third most dangerous campus in the country by The Daily Beast.

7. Level D of the Widener Stacks
Take the rickety, spookily fluorescent-lit elevator to Level D on either side of the stacks, and dare to discover what’s lurking in dark shadows beyond (or between) those musty and obscure books that no one has touched for hundreds of years.

7 1/2. Pusey Tunnel
Considered half a place, as it’s really an extension of Level D, but if you’ve made it out and can muster up the courage to walk deeper into the stacks, find the tunnel that connects the D-East elevator to Pusey Library’s second level. It’s disconcertingly bright and echoey down there, but will anyone be around to hear your screams?

Looking out over the intimate audience in the New College Theatre Studio this Saturday, Slanty Eyed Mama headliner Kate Rigg opened her act with a sarcastic nod to the plethora of Harvard organizations hosting the music duo. “Our hosts just mentioned how excited you guys are to come together,” she said. “It’s a beautiful thing, and you’ll learn how to do it more in college.” Her sexual pun was referring to the nine student organizations ranging from the Harvard Queer Students Associaton to the Asian American Association, who collaborated to bring the Asian-American female spoken word duo to campus.
Rigg, wearing a single red satin arm warmer and a self-identified “narci-sexual,” provided the spoken word poetry and stand-up comedy for the pair, who specialize in tackling racial, sexual, and cultural issues in irreverent half-rapped songs. Her counterpart, Lyris Hung, strummed the electric violin like a guitar and sported a Chinese silk embroidered vest and tattooed arms. Much of the performance was an excerpt from their traveling show, “Birth of A nAsian,” which most recently appeared at the Michigan Womyn’s Music Festival.
Many different races and sexualities were represented in the audience, but some event organizers were excited to see more women in attendance than at other Harvard QSA events.  Harvard QSA co-chair Marco Chan ’11 observed, “People are interested in seeing representations of more queer women, especially when you see so many more gay males dominating the scene.”
Slanty-Eyed Mama’s repertoire delivers a provocative agenda, with slam-poetry songs addressing issues like Naughty Asian Schoolgirls, Mulan, and medical school. At one point, Rigg asked for a show of hands of Asian audience members. Then she asked for a show of hands of Asian pre-meds, which yielded much lower results.
“Looks like we have a bad case of PTAMD going on here,” she said. “Post-Traumatic-Asian-Mom Disorder.”
All joking aside, Rigg did get serious on some issues.
“Especially given the intense tragedy of the LGBT community recently, events that explore intersectionality are especially important,” said Chan. “Besides, can you remember the last time you saw a gay Asian-American female do anything?”

There’s a hand on the screen. To say it’s larger than life is to say nothing. It is the main focus on the screen that is movie-theater width and height, its area an integral proportional to how long it extends, taller than a person, wide as the classroom, where nearly every seat is taken.
Paul Bamberg’s hand on the screen is paused before writing. In real life, he’s leaning over the projector in front of his class in Science Center A. Paul keeps a pen in his front shirt pocket and wears a microphone on his second shirt-button. There is a videographer in the back of the room and her camera has remained motionless, trained on Paul in the center of the classroom, the cinematic focus of the lights hung on the walls. Paul’s hand turns side to side slightly, waiting for the ink or brain waves to flow. He uses a blue Bic pen that’s coming perpendicularly out of the paper, like his thumb does when checking for the direction of magnetic fields.
Paul moves away from the projector and takes three quick steps to the first row of students. He swipes his glasses away from his eyes before saying quickly, “The row reduction algorithm converts a matrix to echelon form. A pivotal one in the last column is the kiss of death.”
As he walks back to the projector, a student in the back raises two fingers.
“Paul,” he says.
“Yes,” Paul says, while swiping off his glasses.
“I’m a little bit confused.”
So Paul starts again, explaining the strategic placement of zeros. Row reduction is a technique that lets you solve systems of equations. It’s a powerful tool, and once everyone gets it, they’re nodding their heads in agreement, looking up between their papers and the giant screen. This is the part of math that can be gotten. You sit, you stare, eventually things make sense.
The thing about the real stuff of pure math, however—the flashes of brilliance, the lucid path through tangled equations—is that it seems like you either have it or you don’t. Like the level of musical adeptness that goes beyond hours and hours of practice, or perfect pitch: natural ability, that most feared and lauded thing. What can we call it except a thing? Like pornography, we know it when we see it. Genius, prodigy.
Which is what’s so strange about this class, Mathematics 23: “Linear Algebra and Real Analysis.” It’s not Math 55, which has its own Wikipedia page—where near-genius mathematicians converge to blaze through four years of math in a single year. It’s not Math 19 or 21 either, generally operating under the assumption that you just need certain practical equations for your science experiments, or your summer internship on Wall Street. Instead, Math 23 promises that genius-prodigy-material, theoretical math, can be taught along with the more practical material—that you too can learn about groups and topology or what it means to span a space. “It spans the subspace,” Paul says. He gestures into the air. The ceiling is blue. There is wood paneling on the walls.
It’s what explains the lack of empty seats in Science Center A, today and every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon; the fact that students of all ages sit and listen, students from New York and California and Uganda. There are doctoral candidates in social sciences, freshmen, humanities concentrators, a much more equal number of males and females than Larry Summers’ infamous declaration would suggest. There is a 10-year-old who sits somewhere in the middle. All here, taking notes, watching Paul trace symbols on the screen.
Paul
One of the first things that Paul G. Bamberg ’63 tells his students is that he wants them to call him Paul. He doesn’t have tenure, so technically it would have to be Dr. Bamberg—and that’s just rubbing it in, so Paul is much better, he likes to say. It’s also a practical thing; if you go up to him and say, “Hey, Paul,” he knows you’ve taken a class with him.
Today a senior lecturer in the mathematics department, Paul has been a math person since very young, teaching himself when necessary. In high school, his Westinghouse Science Talent Search project was a statistical paper involving baseball, developing the conceit—re-invented to popular fame 25 years later—of adding the on-base percentage to the slugging percentage as a good indicator of the successful hitter (concerning baseball, and Markov processes: “Your actual lineup, of course, is a product of nine matrices”). Paul was a physics concentrator at Harvard: “When I was an undergrad,” he says, “my main extracurricular activity was grading homework and writing homework solutions for the introductory physics courses.”
After Harvard, Paul went to Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar, where he worked on elementary particles. This was 1964; post-atom bomb, post-relativity, a time when physicists everywhere were searching for an elegant framework for the universe. “The longed-for Theory of Everything,” Cambridge physicist John D. Barrow once wrote, “promises to provide the final discovery after which all physics will become the refinement of its content, the simplification of its explanation.”
At the time, there were two basic visions of what it was exactly that made up the universe. The first, quark theory, was that there were a handful of elementary particles. The second, the theory supported by Paul and his thesis advisor, was that there were an infinite number of these elementary particles. This was a so-called non-compact theory of elementary particles—non-compact for not closed, not bounded, not finite. Paul worked out an entirely new structure of hyper-geometrized functions to rigorously support this hypothesis.
In his fourth year of graduate school, however, particle accelerators were being built that were powerful enough to look at the atom in a more experimental way, pointing towards a less-than-infinite set of underlying particles. “They were providing what was looking like fairly compelling theoretical experimental evidence for quarks,” says Paul. “When one of my classmates got a job with the title of quark physicist at a university in England, I figured that I had backed the wrong horse.” This is how theoretical physics is: a theory can be genius, elegant, sophisticated, and as right as a thing can be in its own innate sense—but sometimes, reality simply turns out to be different.
He never returned to particle research again: “It was a field that was developing so fast that unless you spent all your time on research you got scooped.” The new mathematics he discovered about generalized hyper-geometrized functions was interesting and valid, but the physical applications didn’t work out as well.
“That particular branch of thesis research was a dead end,” he says, “but what I really wanted to do was teach anyway.”
The Class
Paul has been teaching for 43 years. After returning to Harvard, he was involved with Physics 1—the introductory physics class for pre-meds—for a quarter century, and he’s been in charge of Math 23 for the past five years.
He’s won multiple awards for his teaching, including the Petra T. Shattuck Excellence in Teaching Award and the Dean’s Distinguished Service Award. But as is his custom, he’s not particularly verbose as to why he loves to teach (“I think what I like the very most is interacting with students”).
His passion only appears in action. When asked what he’d teach if he could give a lesson to everyone in Massachusetts, he gets visibly excited. “This is crazy,” he says. “I would teach everyone the small affine faculty senate. Either that or I’d teach everyone to solve quadratic equations with compass and straight edge.” Then he jumps up to the blackboard and starts drawing perpendicular lines. “It’s absolutely elementary.”
Central to the ethos of Paul’s class is the proof system. Mathematical proofs are strings of logical statements, like stepping stones leading from an extremely basic starting principle to an interesting or useful result. In Math 23, students are responsible for about 20 proofs. Manjinder S. Kandola ’14, who had no experience with proofs in high school, says, “I actually talked to an M.D./Ph.D. student last week who had taken 23, and asked, ‘Are you ever going to need proofs later?’ And he said, ‘The actual proofs, you don’t. But what’s interesting is that the kind of logic and way of thinking you develop from having to do those proofs is very important.’”
Paul would agree in part, but for him it goes deeper: it’s simply as important to Paul that you know why something works as how it works. He is, at times, disdainful of “plug-and-chug” methodology, just barging forward without understanding what you’re doing. Translating this philosophy into a grading rubric, however, proved more difficult. Students are responsible for knowing all 20 proofs: for their final grade, they receive .9 points for presenting one of these proofs to another student, and .1 points for listening to one (all catalogued carefully in one’s Proof Log). This direct transaction, however, leaves out an important step. “I started thinking about the logistics,” said Paul, “and I had to invent proof parties.”
Proof parties are publicized student gatherings at which at least 10 proofs are presented. Twenty-dollar refunds are available for refreshments (“We got nachos,” Kandola grins). Kandola relates a recent Harvard FML entry: “It said, ‘Proof loggers have become my primary social networking site.’ And then someone commented, ‘You seriously need to go to a proof party.’”
But the proof parties are emblematic of perhaps Math 23’s most astonishing trait: its social aspect. “It’s established a social schedule,” says Dylan C. Nagler ’14. “Sunday night is in Leverett, Monday night is in Grays, in between is office hours, you talk to people, you present proofs to each other.”
And while Paul might have the look of the traditional math guru (there’s the running joke: How do you know Paul’s feeling social? He’ll look at your shoes rather than his own when he’s talking to you), he is known for his accessibility, setting up extra one-on-one classes with students who have partial time conflicts with Math 23, for example. According to Gurbir S. Dhillon ’13, a current Course Assistant in Math 23 who took the class last year, Paul sent out an e-mail two days before last year’s final, inviting his students over to play an online video game with him. The game was called “Guild Wars.” “He’s quite a formidable player, yeah,” Dhillon says, “He had a whole personal island and all this stuff.”
Paul is known, too, for his anecdotes and shenanigans during class, with which he punctuates the material. “When we start talking about neighborhoods and open sets,” Nagler says, “one year he wore a red cardigan to class, pulled out his glasses and said, ‘Welcome to Mr. Rogers’ open neighborhood.’”
Keeping the math interesting and engaging is important to Paul, as is the fact that his class is a social experience. Everyone works together in the absence of a curve. You’re supposed to make friends, and everyone’s varied experiences are supposed to help you understand the material. This year, however, Math 23 put its open-neighborhood environment to the test, with the inclusion of a new type of student.
Youth And Beauty
It’s nine minutes after in the fourth floor Science Center classroom when Kevin walks in. He’s not quite late: the CA, Anji Tang ’13, follows closely on his heels, apologizing and saying that they really don’t have to get there right on time, she has a bit of a ways to walk. One kid in the back cracks, “Where else are we gonna go?” Math 23 lecture has just ended and it’s a quick elevator ride up to section. Kevin is grinning and taking his seat.
He has a blue binder, grey sweatpants, and a sweatshirt tied around his waist, holding his “Star Trek” T-shirt down like a belt. He’s a little smaller than his other classmates, and, at 10, a little younger, and he sits near the front with an almost-clear view of the board. Today’s proof concerns the mechanics behind differentiability. While one student presents, Tang passes back last week’s p-sets, and when Kevin gets his, he pumps his fist and says, “Yes,” softly to his desk.
Proofs can be tiresome. This one will go on for exactly 20 minutes, neat handwriting stretching from one side of the board to the other. Some students are lazing back in their seats as if waiting for the main event (which they are—homework help). Somebody takes a quick look at freestyle bike tricks on their laptop. Kevin reads the emergency-escape-plan sign on the wall next to him, but he nods his head vigorously in time with every “such that,” and “there exists.” He has an empty Poland Spring bottle that he fools with, and there are six yellow mechanical pencils fastened to the inside of his binder, five together, one apart. He shakes the bottle with his hand, unconsciously, as if trying to get the last drop out.
Kevin, whose name has been changed as per his parents’ request, is the youngest member of Math 23 and is generating a fair amount of excitement. He has been homeschooled up until now, although he did take online courses through a Stanford program until this year. “But he’s getting to an age,” says his father, “where I think it’s a positive thing for him to interact with other people, not just him and his computer.”
Kevin enjoys programming, Legos, and videogames, and the first time his parents knew that there was something wonderful and unusual was when Kevin was 4, on a beach in Jamaica. “We were sitting on the sand under an umbrella, watching the waves,” says his father, “and he was drawing in the sand with a stick. He then commented, out of the blue, how it was interesting that sqrt (5) + sqrt (5) = sqrt (20), and not sqrt (5+5) as one might naively suppose.” When asked how he knew this, Kevin drew a right triangle in the sand, specified a base of length two, a height of length one, and a hypotenuse of length sqrt (2x2+1x1)=sqrt (5). He said this was due to the Pythagorean theorem, which he’d just learned about. “He then noted that if you double the length of all the sides of the triangle you get a hypotenuse of length sqrt (4x4+2x2)=sqrt (20).” His father pauses. “This was when we first realized that Kevin had a special affinity for mathematics.”
At the end of section Kevin stays seated and asks the student next to him if he can do a proof for him. One of his legs is tucked under the other. While he explains the proof, the other student nods and smiles encouragingly, not needing to stop for corrections. “A lot of people tend to assume that he’s some sort of crazy calculator, but that’s not it at all,” Kevin’s father says. “We had to drill him on his times tables, he always forgets stuff like that. But he’s really good at the abstract.”
Office Hours
Paul himself is pleased to have Kevin in the course. “Some years ago the top student in Math 138 was a 13-year-old homeschooled student,” he says. “I myself had tried to learn calculus when I was 9 and had to give up because I couldn’t find anyone who knew any calculus and could help me.” He smiles when discussing his youngest pupil, his hand fiddling with his glasses. “I’m not at all surprised that there’s a youngster who can handle this course. And he seems pretty with it.”
For Paul’s office hours the door is always open. There are five folding chairs across from the blackboard that stretches from one end of the room to the other, and then the red armchair where Paul sits, holding court. Students go in and out to present proofs, talk about theory, discuss homework questions.
It’s here that Paul is in his element, correcting pluses and minuses in long mathematical sentences, coaxing students through the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, writing symbols on the walls. One student, who is heading out of a chat with Paul, lingers in the doorframe while another student begins a proof.
“Is it OK if I sit and watch?” he asks.
“Of course, of course!” says Paul, and the student takes a seat and gazes at the numbers and letters on the blackboard.
About Paul, Nagler says, “You know, no surprise, he’s also amazing at computer science.” Which is perhaps an understatement: Paul took a few years off from teaching in the late ’80s and ’90s to develop speech recognition software. The software relies on the fact that you can model speech as a so-called hidden Markov process, and some little mathematical tricks of replacing probabilities that are conveniently close to zero. Today it’s known as Dragon NaturallySpeaking: “You can buy it in Best Buy,” Paul says. It’s why he gets his own Wikipedia entry, along with his Rhodes Scholarship.
Modeling speech is a different type of research from his work in particle physics, but it has in it certain echoes: words, the building blocks, a universal theory. As a teacher, his work is partly in translation too. In class, Paul often insists that the mathematical symbology ∀, ∈, ∃, is the hardest part of math, and that it’s easy to impress your roommate when you know little things: “∀” means “for all,” “∃” is “there exists.” And then of course, there are the things beyond the symbols—the true thrill and genius of math, the part that Paul hopes his class can impart.
There are moments when the light breaks, even briefly, like it did for Kevin on a beach in Jamaica playing in the sand. “It happened last week,” Kandola says. “Paul was writing something. And he actually made a computational mistake, when multiplying a matrix. So he went on to the next part, and I was just looking over it like, ‘This should be something else.’ And then someone pointed it out, and I was like ‘Yes!’ Like, I’m not a moron. I actually picked up on this.”
“There was one specific proof that I sat through and just completely understood,” says Nagler. “Sometimes it all clicks and I really appreciate that.”
“It’s a bright bunch of kids,” Dhillon says about the students in his section. “It’s all pretty new to them, still retains that certain sense of wonder.” He snaps his fingers searching for an example.  “Like, I don’t know, like definitely once you hear about the fact that there’s different orders of infinity the first time. It’s just absolutely mind-blowing, until you get gradually acclimated to seeing these unbelievable things on a frequent basis,” he says.
“It’s kind of cool seeing the initial blush of excitement.”

Halloween is the only day of the year when it’s perfectly acceptable to look like a total skank.
Think about that statement. When else is it okay for a female to literally wear anything she desires, without facing judgment?
In this day and age, we—as women—like to think of ourselves as liberated; we like to believe that we can wear whatever we want, wherever we want. But everyone knows that this isn’t really the case.
Except on Halloween. No one will even blink twice as you parade down Mass. Ave., no matter how miniscule your skirt or low-cut your top.  If someone is to bat an eye—well, an even-teenier skirt is probably on the way.
And not only will no one judge you for wearing as little clothing as possible, you can also get some great bargains.  Paying $9.99 to morph into a sexy feline for the night? That sure is a lot cheaper than plastic surgery.
Meanwhile, at a place like Harvard, it’s not often that service industry jobs outside of finance and consulting get much love. But when it comes to Halloween, police officers, fire fighters, nurses, maids, and flight attendants are the professions of choice.
But it’s not just on the female side of the spectrum: Boys in scantily clad construction worker outfits can appear just as slutty. Isn’t it time that we at Harvard represent something other than Wall Street? Slutty Halloween costumes are all about bringing sexy back to Main Street.
Best of all, on Halloween, dressing like a slut doesn’t mean you actually are one.

This is what I despise about Halloween: the goal isn’t to think of a creative and witty costume; it’s to figure out how to make that costume you bought at Target the night before even sluttier. All that’s required is a pair of scissors and some lace, and that pumpkin costume goes from Jack-o’-Lantern to Jack-o’-Licious. Work it, girl.
This Halloween, do me a favor and throw some creativity in there. Don’t just be the slutty nurse—be the slutty nurse with the Russian accent.

Avraham S. Steinberg ’02, better known by friends and fans as Avi, has a new book and a glowing review from The New York Times. But, years ago, the former History and Literature concentrator from Kirkland barely finished his senior thesis. “I handed in my thesis without the last page,” he said. “It ends mid-sentence.”
The thesis on Bugs Bunny ended up winning the undergraduate Perry Miller Prize. Steinberg’s most recent project is a book titled “Running the Books: The Adventures of an Accidental Prison Librarian.” The memoir recounts his time employed at the Suffolk County House of Corrections, and profiles the relationships the author developed with the inmates. “I wouldn’t say I saw that coming,” said Peter Lurie, Steinberg’s senior thesis advisor and former History and Literature tutor. “But I easily could have anticipated Avi doing something socially conscious.”
Brad R. Sohn ’02, Steinberg’s three-year college roommate, agrees. “Avi working as a prison librarian probably trumps Chris Nowinski leaving Harvard to become a WWF wrestler on the unlikely Harvard careers list.”
Looking back, Steinberg says he now has the ability to value the times he was just hanging out at Harvard. While most students feel that spare time is unproductive, the author argues the contrary. “As an undergrad, I had long lunches,” he said. “So many creative relationships are created in this setting.” So stay a little longer in the dining hall. You’re not being idle—you might end up writing a book someday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Individuals with albinism in the United States may face discrimination and marginalization. But that experience hardly compares with the position of albinos in Tanzania, where individuals with the condition are routinely murdered for their bones, which are used in potions, according to accounts presented at a panel discussion last night.
Sponsored by the Harvard Foundation, the panel, titled “Prejudice and Violence Against People with Albinism,” included several individuals working to advance the cause of individuals with albinism.
“For witch doctors, people with albinism are commodities, things they can trade—not human beings” said Vicky Ntetema, a Tanzanian by birth and former BBC reporter.
After they are killed, albinos’ bones are often used for potions that witchdoctors say can make Tanzanians rich and successful.
At a conference for people with albinism in Tanzania, Ntetema said that an individual with albinism told the audience that, “We want scientists that can confirm these findings of witch doctors that albino body parts can make you rich”.
“That day I said to myself that I don’t know my country,” Ntetema said, adding that albinism has become so stigmatized that albinos would be willing to sacrifice themselves if sufficient scientific evidence justified their deaths.
This experience, she said, led her to become an undercover reporter to expose the practices of witch doctors in Tanzania.
Albino children in Tanzania have not been immune to the violence directed against their kin and many of them have taken shelter in a governmental school.
“The children would not laugh. They would not smile,” said Peter Ash, the founder of Under the Same Sun, which works to advance albino rights. “They were all living in a state of trauma.”
Marina M.A. Connelly ’12, a Harvard student with albinism, said that her cultural experiences in living with albinism have been very different, and that her experiences in the United States have “been far more inclusive” than in her native Australia. Connelly grew up in Australia and came to the United States to attend college at Harvard.
“Differences are something that we can choose to deny or choose to honor,” she said. Educating individuals about these conditions such as albinism, she added, is a “community effort.”
The panel also included Rick Guidotti, a documentarian, photographer, and co-founder of “Positive Exposure,” an organization that uses visual arts to embrace people with genetic differences.
Formerly a fashion photographer in New York City, Guidotti explained that he was “always forced to work within the beauty standard” but has recently worked with albino men, women, and children.
He has also traveled with organizations such as “Under the Same Sun” to hear the stories of Africans with albinism and to change perceptions of albinism through photography. Guidotti’s exhibit of people with albinism is on display in the lobby of the Science Center today.

As if the risk of heart disease was not enough, men now have another incentive to monitor their fat intake with the release this week of a Harvard Medical School study that found that high levels of saturated fats could damage their sperm.
According to the study, an increased intake of saturated fats and monounsaturated fats—which are commonly found in meats, butter, and dairy products—may result in a lower sperm concentration.
But the research also suggests that increasing consumption of polyunsaturated fats may have the opposite effect. The study found that omega-3 fatty acids, primarily those found in fish fats, are associated with improved sperm motility and morphology, which relate to sperm movement and the size and shape of the sperm.
According to the study’s lead researcher, Jill A. Attaman, who is an instructor in Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Biology at the Medical School, the results may impact  men in different ways. The study indicates that those with a marginal sperm concentration may see more of an effect than men who have a higher sperm count to begin with, she said.
“Overall, our work adds to emerging literature showing that modifiable lifestyle factors, specifically nutrition, have an association with male fertility potential,” said Attaman. “What is really significant is that this is the first study to show this specific relationship.”
The study was performed at Massachusetts General Hospital and involved men presenting to a fertility clinic for evaluation, some of whom had normal sperm levels and others with impaired semen quality. Men submitted a semen sample to be analyzed and then filled out a questionnaire about their intake of particular fats.
Researchers then examined the relationship between these two pieces of data and found a relationship between increased fat saturated fat consumption and lower sperm quality.
“There are multiple areas in which we are looking to focus on furthering this research,” said Attaman. “In particular, I would like to see how these findings apply in a population of males that are not presenting to a clinic for infertility.”
The findings were presented at the annual conference of American Society for Reproductive Medicine conference in Denver this week.

The Qur’an is fundamentally untranslatable, according to Bonn University Professor Emeritus of Semitic Languages and Islamic Studies Stefan Wild.
In a lecture sponsored by the Center for Middle Eastern Studies, Wild said yesterday that the sacred Islamic text cannot be perfectly replicated in another language.
“The miraculous rhetorical quality that the Qur’an has for the reader is lost in translation,” he said.
However, Wild added that globalization, which has played a role in the increase of non-Arabic speaking Muslims throughout the world, makes these translations necessary.
According to Wild, the problem then becomes how to translate the text in a way that creates meaning but also preserves the stylistic dignity of the original.
But this is perhaps “an unsolvable question,” he added.
Wild said that mistranslation usually occurs when translators retain Arabic terms or force a single meaning upon Arabic words. These decisions stem from an unsuccessful effort to stay true to the original text, he added.
“If the translator does not know and master the target language, he will fall into this trap,” Wild said.
Citing translation of the Qur’an into sign language as an extreme example of the modernization of the text, Wild said that translating the Qur’an has come into sharper focus in recent years.
Wild predicted that in the future, translations will become increasingly numerous and divergent from the Arabic text. He added that translators will continue to attempt what he dubbed an “impossible” task—translating the Qur’an into different languages while staying true to the text’s Arabic nuance.
Wild concluded his lecture by acknowledging the essential paradox in translating the Qur’an.
“It cannot be translated, but it must be translated,” he said.
Jonathan J.N. Edwards, a first-year graduate student at the Center for Middle Eastern Studies, agreed with Wild’s assessment of the challenges posed by translating the Qur’an.
“Like any other great literary work, it’s certainly impossible to do a full translation,” Edwards said.
Wild’s lecture—titled “The Qur’an Today: Why Translate the Untranslatable?”—was the final installment of the three-part Fall 2010 H.A.R. Gibb Arabic & Islamic Studies Lectures series.

Their Day in the Yard, a student-led initiative to right the wrongs of Harvard’s infamous Secret Court of 1920, has earned the support of various student groups and the attention of the City of Cambridge GLBT Commission.
The movement—spearheaded by a Harvard Extension School student who wishes to remain anonymous because she is also a University employee—was conceived over the summer to grant posthumous degrees to the seven homosexual undergraduates that Harvard persecuted and ultimately expelled in the early 1920s.
Student organizations on campus like Girlspot, Harvard Queer Students and Allies, and GLOW—Gay, Lesbian, or Whatever—have voiced their support for awarding the posthumous degrees on “secretcourt.org,” the movement’s website. Additionally, over 430 people have expressed their support on the movement’s Facebook petition.
QSA Co-chair Marco Chan ’11 said that Their Day in the Yard’s scope has extended beyond the confines of the University.
Shortly after The Crimson published a piece on Their Day in the Yard in late September, Robert L. Parlin ’85—a member of the City of Cambridge GLBT Commission—expressed his support for the movement, according to Chan.
Although Parlin could not be reached for comment, John W. Gintell, co-director of the commission, said that the issue of whether Harvard should award the posthumous degrees is “something the commission should at least talk about.”
He added that the commission’s monthly meeting—held last night—might not have room to discuss the history of Harvard and the Secret Court, as the agenda already contained a full list of other topics to discuss related to the present day.
The Cambridge commission deals primarily with GLBT issues in the police department, schools, medical services, and housing, according to Gintell.
“I kind of think that what our commission is most interested in is the present and the future,” he said. “This is my personal take, but I’d rather have things work out so that if sometime in the future there’s some GLBT issue, the Harvard police department will be better equipped to deal with it.”
Of the Secret Court itself, Gintell said, “it’s a pretty ugly thing in the past, but it was a long time ago.”
Leaders of Their Day in the Yard said that they would value the support of the City of Cambridge because it would show that the history of the Secret Court was a concern for the local community beyond the narrow scope of Harvard.
“These students were not only asked to leave Harvard,” the Extension School student said. “They were also asked to leave Cambridge the city, so that’s great that they’re supporting us.”

Administrators and students explored whether extracurricular activities induce excessive stress and whether the transition to sophomore year can be eased at a Committee on Student Life meeting yesterday morning.
After a fall in the number of recognized student groups this school year from 409 to 392 clubs, the committee—which comprises Undergraduate Council members, House Masters, and College administrators—discussed the broader role of student groups on campus.
While some students emphasized the importance of student group events, especially for social life among freshmen, others considered curtailing the intensity of extracurricular activities, from postponing the activities fair until after study card day to decreasing the number of e-mails groups send.
“Even before you get here in the fall, you’re hit over the head with a barrage of e-mails from all these groups,” said meeting attendee Catherine G. Katz ’13.
Although administrators said that academics must remain students’ first priority, some students said that extracurricular activities dominate campus life and, consequently, their time.
Committee members spent the second half of the meeting discussing the transition to sophomore year.
A survey conducted in the Houses last academic year yielded positive reviews of the sophomore advising program. When asked if they were satisfied with the program, 84 percent of students surveyed either agreed or strongly agreed.
The committee discussed whether, in addition to the advising program, it would be beneficial to have a broader sophomore welcoming program or orientation as students transition from freshman dormitories to upperclassman Houses.
To integrate sophomores into House communities, committee members suggested ideas ranging from a class-wide welcome-back event in Annenberg Hall—which was dismissed because of the use of the space by freshmen—to having Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds send an e-mail in August to welcome back returning students.
The group also talked about the concept of the “sophomore slump” and whether the College can help students avoid declining happiness during their sophomore year.
Many members said that the vibrancy of House Committees is particularly important for integrating sophomores into the House and maintaining student spirit.

Measuring the mass of a star now only takes two things: a planet and a moon.
David M. Kipping, a predoctoral fellow at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, has developed a new method to measure the mass of a star when provided information about the planets and moons orbiting the star.
The findings, published online earlier this month in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society Letters, will allow researchers to calculate the star’s mass with greater precision, according to Kipping. Previously, astronomers measured the temperature and age of the star to estimate its mass.
With Kipping’s method, researchers can measure the diameters, orbit radii, and orbit periods of the planet and moon. Then, Kepler’s third law of planetary motion can be used to derive the mass of the star.
“It was one of those papers where you get struck by an idea and you sit down late at night and do the math,” said Kipping, who researches exoplanets and exomoons, which are planets and moons outside of the Earth’s solar system.
Kipping has yet to use his method, as no exomoons have been discovered yet. But that may change in the near future, according to Laird M. Close, an astronomy professor at the University of Arizona and an exoplanet expert.
Close said that NASA’s Kepler spacecraft—an observatory launched in March 2009 that seeks to find earth-like exoplanets—has the ability to detect exomoons. Researchers have discovered more than 90 transiting exoplanets and confirmed the existence of more than 400 others.
Close said that Kipping’s method would allow researchers to confirm estimates and calibrate the models they use to measure the mass of a star.
“That’s what science is about—checking your assumptions,” Close said.
While Close said that Kipping’s method is a “difficult way to find the mass of a star,” he added it would likely still be accessible to undergraduate astronomy and physics students.

To properly store her delicate samples of carbon nanotubes, Ruby A. Lai ’12 spent her hot summer in Cambridge fixing a helium fridge that could cool the temperature down to a few hundredths of a degree above absolute zero.
The Chemistry and Physics concentrator has been working at the Harvard Marcus Lab since sophomore year to study carbon nanotubes, which are long, thin fibers of carbon atoms arranged in hexagonal patterns. Much “fundamental physical research” has been performed about nanotubes, which were first synthesized about a decade ago, according to Lai.
The researchers in the Marcus Lab are working to find a way to use the two spin directions of electrons in the nanotubes to encode information. Such a development would mark an important step toward the making of quantum computers.
Lai said that the researchers must overcome the difficulty of capturing an electron’s spin in the nanotubes—a task that her lab’s principal investigator, Charles M. Marcus, had hypothesized last year could be made possible by manipulating bends into the carbon cylinders.
A bend in the cylinder introduces a rapid change to the magnetic field that runs along the nanotube and may be used to manipulate electron spins, according to Lai.
“It’s a very new idea, and nobody’s ever done experimental studies on nanotube bends and how they behave electrically,” she said.
Lai’s experiments will be the first to characterize the effects of the bend and to determine the differences between bent and straight nanotubes. She said that she hopes to discover whether the bends have as great of a potential as hypothesized.
“Everything is in theory land right now, and we’re all just waiting for the first experiment,” said Marcus, a professor of physics. “I think [Lai’s] experiment can have a big impact.”
Lai first became interested in nanotubes and graphene—the research subject of the winners of the Nobel Prize in Physics this year—through her freshman seminar called “Molecular Motors: Wizards of the Nanoworld,” led by Professor Emeritus Dudley R. Herschbach, who won the 1986 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.
“During my freshman year, graphene research was really cutting edge,” Lai said. “I was really inspired by a presentation that I worked on.”

Benjamin I. Rapoport, a student in the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology, has developed a new model that allows marathon runners to calculate fueling requirements based upon their aerobic capacity and target pace.
Rapoport, the author of the paper that details the research, said that he sought to provide a tool that distance runners can use to prepare for and run a successful race.
Many marathon runners tend to run the beginning of a race too quickly, depleting their carbohydrate reserves and leading to the experience of “hitting the wall,” when the body begins to burn fat in the absence of carbohydrates. Not only is the experience painful, but it forces a runner to slow his or her pace considerably, according to Rapoport.
The model, published last week in PLoS Computational Biology, allows runners to calculate how much fuel they need to consume before a race to sustain their target pace without “hitting the wall.”
“No one before had properly quantified how much fuel you need [to sustain a given pace],” Rapoport said. “My goal was to generate a mathematical model to figure out how the body works as an engine.”
He has launched an online endurance calculator that uses his model for individuals to calculate their own fueling requirements given a target pace.
The model uses aerobic capacity, or VO2max, to calculate fueling requirements. VO2max is a measure of how much oxygen the body can transport to the muscles and use during aerobic exercise.
Although the energetics are different for each sport, the principles of aerobic exercise are the same, according to Rapoport. As a result, he said that his model could be extended to other athletes like triathletes, hikers, and swimmers, whose forms of exercise are mostly aerobic.
He also said that other factors—including the levels of fluid electrolytes such as sodium and potassium—also affect aerobic performance. Rapoport said that he hopes to conduct further research to quantify these parameters.
Rapoport started his research six years ago, when he missed a Medical School class to run the Boston Marathon. To make up for his absence, Rapoport was asked to deliver a talk to the class about the physiology of endurance running. Rapoport has given this lecture every year since.
“It is a beautiful thing to confront your limits,” Rapoport said about endurance running. “I hope that this model will help people to get as close to those limits as possible.”

The Harvard Museum of Natural History hosted a play highlighting the relationship between Charles Darwin and Harvard Herbaria founder Asa Gray, a devout Christian who was one of the first to address the conflict between religion and evolution.
Craig Baxter’s “Re: Design” is a one-act play performed by the English theater group Menagerie that depicts Darwin and Gray’s discourse. Originally commissioned to honor Darwin, the play provides a fresh perspective when viewed in the context of the bicentennial celebration of Gray’s birth, according to History of Science Department Chair Janet Browne, who organized the event.
In the play, Darwin and Gray never exchange dialogue and instead discuss their beliefs by writing letters and handing them to each other.
“Gray’s main argument was that Darwin’s theories do not explain where all the variations come from,” Browne said. “How could chance produce such exquisitely designed organisms?”
The pair enjoyed a warm relationship, and Gray helped Darwin publish the American editions of his marquee work “On the Origin of Species.” But throughout his lifetime, Gray attempted to resolve the apparent conflict between evolution and religion.
Browne said that she appreciated Gray’s efforts to bridge the gap between the two theories, for she believes that evolutionary biology and faith in a divine power are not necessarily mutually exclusive. As such, Gray’s 200th birthday presents an opportunity to engage in healthy and constructive debates on “good relations between science and religion,” Browne said.
“There is plenty of room to maneuver in the middle ground,” she added.

The American Physical Society named Physics Professor Gerald Gabrielse the winner of the 2011 Julius Edgar Lilienfeld Prize last week for his contributions to the study and teaching of physics.
Gabrielse developed novel methods of measuring with greater precision the magnetic moment of an electron and the fine structure constant—two quantities that are relevant to modern particle physics research.
The professor and his research team suspended an electron in an apparatus to study a loosely bound electron without the interference of other particles usually found in an atom. By examining the behavior of the electron, Gabrielse made precise measurements of the magnetic moment and fine structure constant.
“Our measurement is arguably the most accurate comparison of any theory and experiment in physics,” said Gabrielse, who added that the team measured the magnetic moment at a precision of three parts in 10 trillion.
Gabrielse emphasized the scope of the research efforts that finally led to the measurements.
“This measurement took us 20 years. There were about 10 grad students involved in it, each developing methods one thesis at a time that we hoped to eventually put together,” he said.
The Lilienfeld Prize awards $10,000, a certificate, and expenses for three lectures. The recognition can be awarded to anybody involved in physics research, regardless of the individual’s specific discipline.
Gabrielse said that he was particularly honored to have been named the winner of the prize due to its acceptance of various types of research within physics.
Gabrielse was also named the winner of the Lilienfeld Prize for his “exceptional skill in sharing the science with diverse audiences.” He delivers more than 50 lectures a year beyond his usual teaching duties at Harvard, and he had been awarded the 2000 Levenson Teaching Award by Harvard.
“He’s a fantastic teacher,” said Physics Lecturer David Morin.

In a recent study undertaken to explore the consumption of hydrocarbons in deep sea environments, two Harvard scientists discovered that microbes in the Gulf of Mexico are consuming methane up to a hundred times faster than previously thought.
Scott D. Wankel, research associate in earth and planetary sciences, and Peter Girguis, associate professor of the natural sciences, examined methane and other hydrocarbons in deep sea brian pools with the help of a newly designed instrument that enabled the researchers to collect samples in unfavorable conditions.
Brian pools are accumulations of fluids at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico that are three or more times saltier than the ocean, according to Wankel. The biggest obstacle faced by the research team, he said, was the high pressures that existed in the brian pools.
“If we took samples and brought them back to the ship, it would be like champagne, bubbling because the concentration of the gases is so high,” Wankel said.
To overcome this obstacle, the research team designed a mass spectrometer which enabled them to conduct the study. This instrument, classified as a great technological advancement by Wanker, enabled the researchers to gain access to samples that were never previously examined.
According to Wankel, similar research can possibly enable researchers to understand how chemical processes are working inside such extreme environments.
“The ultimate goal in terms of environmental policy as a biogeochemist, as I will call myself, is to better understand globally processes that control things like the climate,” Wankel said.
When asked about how this research relates to the recent Gulf of Mexico oil spill, Wankel emphasized the difference between the environment of the water affected by the oil spill and that of the extreme environments studied for his research.
“There has been some talk about the applications of our research to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill,” Wankel said. “These are very different environments.”

The number of undergraduate concentrators in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences has grown rapidly over the past three years, rising by more than 39 percent over that period.
Yet amidst this rapid growth, the school has seen its proportion of African-American and Latino students remain substantially below the proportions in the overall Harvard population.
With 415 students currently concentrating in SEAS, only 4.8 percent identify as African-American and 2.4 percent identify as Latino. Among all Harvard students, the corresponding percentages are roughly 11 percent and 10 percent, according to statistics from the Admissions office.
While SEAS makes some formal efforts to attract minority students, “we haven’t gone and tried to get internal recruitment,” says Harry R. Lewis ’68, former dean of the College and a professor of computer sciences.
Despite its struggle to attract underrepresented minority groups, SEAS has done well in drawing foreign national students and Asian and Pacific Americans. Eighty-seven foreign nationals—many from African nations—are pursuing an engineering or applied science concentration, as are 91 Asian or Pacific Americans, according to data published by SEAS.
As the school projects further expansion and nears SEAS Dean Cherry A. Murray’s stated goal of capturing 600 undergraduate concentrators, the question remains as to how SEAS can attract more students from underrepresented minority groups.
NATIONAL TRENDS
The underrepresentation of African-Americans and Latinos in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields is a problem that is not unique to Harvard.
A recent study published by the National Academies found that African-Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans hold only 9 percent of American jobs in STEM-related fields, despite comprising about 29 percent of the population.
And according to data provided by the American Society for Engineering Education, African-Americans comprised, on average, about 5.2 percent of national engineering students between 2000 and 2008, while Hispanics comprised about 5.8 percent.
The corresponding averages among Harvard students in SEAS over that period are very similar—about 5.1 percent for African-Americans and 4.5 percent for Hispanics.
“This isn’t a problem for Harvard so much as this is a problem in STEM in particular,” says Computer Science Professor Margo I. Seltzer. “It’s not clear that we’re going to be able to fix this single-handedly.”
Seltzer says she thinks that by the time these students arrive at college, they may be disinclined from studying a STEM field, an obstacle for colleges that wish to draw talented minority students toward fields within engineering or applied science.
“If someone had figured out...some recipe to get more minority students [to concentrate in STEM], it would be fabulous,” Seltzer says. “But at the end of the day, students get to pick their concentrations.”
AFRICAN OR AFRICAN-AMERICAN
As of last spring, only 20 African-Americans are concentrating in SEAS, according to SEAS data. But a far higher proportion of concentrators in engineering, applied math, and computer science self-identify as black because this group includes students who directly hail from Africa.
Most students contacted for this article say that they believe a higher proportion of black SEAS concentrators were African, rather than African-American.
In interviews with a number of black students within SEAS, a number of trends emerged which may shed light on why more African students than African-Americans may feel drawn to engineering and applied science.
Many African engineering concentrators pointed to cultural expectations as a primary motivation behind their decision to take on their major.
“In the countries where we come from, the economies are not really well-developed. The best way to get a stable job is in the physical sciences,” says Leonard C. Kogos ’12, a Kenya native who is studying engineering sciences. “There is a perception that when we go to school, we should study something like engineering.”
Nigerian student John Yusufu ’12 echoed this view, noting that engineering and some of the applied sciences are viewed as “prestigious” in Africa.
Yet some African-American students say that their engineering studies stem from individual interest. Hilton H. Augustine ’13 says he has always been interested in technology and electronics, and Ainsley E. Faux ’13 says he has “always been interested in understanding how things work and building things.” Both students plan to declare concentrations within SEAS.
Based on her experiences with African and African-American friends, Nigerian student Olumurejiwa “Mureji” A. Fatunde ’12 says she believes that the latter group is more receptive to choosing majors in the humanities simply because they have a broader sense of acceptable career options.
Even if cultural forces may encourage more African-American students to major in the humanities, no students indicated that any institutional barrier exists to discourage African-Americans from majoring in SEAS.
“I don’t see anything inside SEAS that is creating the discrepancy,” Augustine says.
DIVERSIFYING THE FACULTY
Murray says that one potential method to increase the number of African-American and Latino concentrators within SEAS is to attract a greater number of faculty members from underrepresented minority groups. Such efforts have shown to be successful among graduate students, she notes.
According to SEAS Director of Communications Michael P. Rutter, some efforts to diversify the faculty are already underway.
“I would say that we have begun to think about ways to further improve our efforts to diversify our junior faculty,” Rutter writes in an e-mail, adding that any diversification plans are still “nascent” and “in development.”
Several black SEAS students say that they noticed the relative lack of black professors within the school, though most say that the issue has not affected their perception of SEAS.
“I have not yet seen a black SEAS professor, but it hasn’t really been an issue for me,” Augustine says.
Several SEAS professors say they are skeptical as to whether these efforts would actually draw more African-American or Latino students.
“I’d love to see some data...It’s one of those issues that is somewhat speculative,” Lewis says, adding that he himself has never seen any evidence that underrepresented minority students did not study computer science because of a dearth of minority faculty in CS.
Seltzer also expresses doubts about the efficacy of such a plan, drawing on her own experience teaching introductory computer science as a female professor.
“When I taught CS50, I had no better success recruiting women than any of my male colleagues,” she says. “From my experience, diversifying the faculty is not enough.”
ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS
Besides faculty diversification, Murray says that she hopes to attract underrepresented minorities to SEAS by dispelling the notion that the school is a “Darwinian” place of intense competition and interminable problem sets.
“I would like to get away from [the] notion that you have to go over many hurdles before you can become an engineering concentrator,” Murray says. “I think if you make those first few courses more exciting, then it will be more inclusive.”
According to Lewis, SEAS makes “special efforts” to get in touch with minority students who have been admitted to Harvard and mentioned an interest in engineering or applied sciences in their applications.
Even if some African-American and Latino students choose majors outside of those offered by SEAS, Rutter, the SEAS communications director, says that popular introductory classes still allow the school to reach out to them.
“SEAS doesn’t educate just concentrators,” he says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In an effort to streamline the University’s capital planning, Harvard Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp has implemented a more rigorous and centralized process for reviewing each school’s building plans.
Every school will submit a five-year capital plan, which Lapp will review with University President Drew G. Faust. The plans will then receive official approval by the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body.
Lapp said that the change was spurred in part by the financial crisis and its severe effects on the University—including the indefinite halt in construction on Harvard’s Allston Science Complex announced in December 2009.
According to Faust, the University had plans to invest up to $10 billion over a 10- to 15-year period when it was actively pursuing development in Allston before the downturn.
“We were going to build very rapidly and on a larger scale, so when you have fewer resources and less access to debt, then you have to be more scrutinous,” Faust said. “What we’ve been focusing now is what we can get accomplished.”
Lapp said the University will encourage schools to fund projects through philanthropy wherever possible and appropriate.
“We want to be much more strategic than we may have been in the past, much more targeted about where we are going to put our capital dollars,” she said.
In the past decade, many University projects have been funded through debt sales and the University’s own funds. Such debts, which require monthly payments to bondholders, became less desirable after the University’s endowment plummeted by 22 percent in fiscal year 2008.
Lapp said that Harvard will concentrate more on financing projects in “conservative ways,” pointing to Harvard Business School’s recent announcement of two construction projects in Allston.
The Business School plans to build a new executive education building that will cost between $90 and $100 million, according to Dean Nitin Nohria. The building will be financed by a $50-million gift from Tata Trusts and Companies—philanthropic entities of India’s Tata Group, which is one of India’s largest companies.
In addition, the Business School will renovate the old WGBH building on Western Avenue to open a lab for innovation and entrepreneurship, which will cost between $15 and $20 million.
“As we’re much more rigorous about our resources, we’re going to be more explicit about tying funding to the inauguration of projects and making sure that projects we feel can have a significant philanthropic dimension have that in place as we go forward,” Faust said.
The WGBH building project uses an existing property holding for a new purpose—a goal of the revamped review process—according to Lapp.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 11 U.S. states and one territory, 13 Harvard alumni and one former professor are aiming for the highest political position—the prestigious post of governor.
From coast to coast and beyond—one is trying to nab the top spot in Alaska and another in the U.S. Virgin Islands—these alumni are striving to bring to their states the lessons they learned in Cambridge.
Among these candidates, two are sitting governors seeking reelection, and six are challenging the incumbent chief executives of their states. Three are Republicans, eight are Democrats, one is a member of the Green-Rainbow party, and two are Independents. Twelve are men and two are women.
Nine attended Harvard as undergraduates; two studied at the Kennedy School of Government and one taught there. Four hail from Harvard Business School and one from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences; one holds a degree from the Law School and another from the Medical School.
These fourteen candidates have their educational background in common, but beyond that, their opinions and experiences vary widely.
SEA TO TROUBLED SEA
Campaigning in states with vastly different populations, locations, and climates—both political and meteorological—they are focused on a wide variety of issues.
Running for governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands, Kennedy School and Business School graduate Kenneth E. Mapp says that “crime—violent crime in particular” is the most important issue in his campaign.
His eight-page platform opens with the words, “Hi, I’m Ken Mapp. Since Governor [John P.] de Jongh [Jr.] took office in 2007, violent crime and murder have set new records every year.”
Mapp, an Independent running against the incumbent Democratic governor in a race with no Republican candidate, continues, “Our homicide rate is more than four times the national average. People in the Virgin Islands are getting killed four times faster than anywhere in America.”
In South Dakota, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Scott N. Heidepriem is focused on his state’s poor performance in a different sphere—public education.
“South Dakota’s college students have the greatest percentage of debt of any state in the union,” Heidepriem asserts. “I think it’s because...we just really have not done a good job supporting education in South Dakota.”
Stating that the share of the state budget devoted to education has been slashed eight percent in the past year, he says, “I’m committed to reversing that trend.”
Over 2,000 miles away, Ethan A. Berkowitz ’83 is talking about issues that are particular to Alaska, where he is running on the Democratic ticket. “We’re a resource development state,” Berkowitz says. “We need to ensure that we continue to produce oil and begin to produce gas.”
For Samuel “Terry” P. Goddard ’69, who hopes to be the next Democratic governor of Arizona, immigration “undoubtedly is what has polarized this election more than anything else.”
Goddard says that his priority in addressing the issue of immigration would be to urge the federal government to pass an immigration reform bill. “Because of the federal government’s failure to act either in securing the border or in forcing employer sanctions...we may have to again go it alone and try to find a solution for our state,” he warns.
Though each state presents its own challenges to its would-be political leaders, there are some problems that are troublesome nationwide. All of the candidates interviewed for this story mentioned their states’ economies and budget deficits among their foremost concerns.
“By far the most important issue is our economy and the fact that it’s in such bad shape,” says Goddard. “After years of spectacular success, we’re on the rocks. We have the largest job loss in the country on a per capita basis, and that’s a real reversal of fortune for the state of Arizona.”
In Connecticut, Republican candidate Thomas C. Foley ’75 says, “To create jobs in Connecticut, it will require the government to get the budget under control, because no employers are going to come here. Too many people don’t see the opportunities here that they used to...we need to change the policies that have run businesses out of the state.”
Focusing on families as well as businesses, Foley, whose son is currently a sophomore at the College, added, “We simply tax people too much in Connecticut.... Families are struggling all over Connecticut, and state government isn’t reducing spending.”
THE HARVARD EFFECT
Many of the candidates reflect on elements of their Harvard backgrounds that influence their political involvement to this day.
Mapp says choosing to spend two years studying government and business at Harvard was “the singular most important decision I made that is benefiting my community.”
He adds that his education among classmates from a variety of countries “allowed me to put the problems confronting the people of the Virgin Islands in great perspective and realize [that] with some of the petty politics in our community, we were squandering great opportunities.”
Heidepriem also praises the political education he received at the Kennedy School. “I would say that the Kennedy School was an important laboratory of ideas for me. It was helpful in allowing me to think about policy questions and in crystallizing my own point of view,” he says. “I wouldn’t say that my opinions changed at all, but the way in which I approached public policy questions moved from an emotional basis to an empirical, rational structure.”
Berkowitz recalls discussing politics with his roommates in Quincy House. “Unfortunately for them, they are now some of my biggest contributors,” he jests, adding that his former roommates now send donations to his campaign, even though none of them live in Alaska,
Berkowitz’s undergraduate years also helped lead him to Alaska, the state where he has lived for the past 20 years and that he hopes to helm as governor. Raised in California, he wrote his thesis on “the political economy of Antarctica” and became enamored by the “high latitude attitude” that he found there while performing his thesis research.
“When you live in a place where you can rise or fall based on your own personal ability, that’s very attractive,” he says. “When you have fewer people, there are more opportunities for that.”
Foley noted that three current gubernatorial candidates—Margaret “Meg” C. Whitman of California, Governor John H. Lynch of New Hampshire, and himself—were all members of the Class of 1979 at Harvard Business School.  Lynch later served as the Business School’s director of admissions.
“We’re seeing a trend of people going into elected office who are not career politicians and have qualifications other than just having succeeded in getting elected to office,” Foley observed. “I think that’s a very good trend for the country.”
“I think the culture at Harvard is invested in service and a sense of giving back,” he adds. “A lot of my peers were interested in going into politics, and I think that certainly contributed to my heading down this path.”
BEYOND THE IVY GATES
Despite these fond memories of their education, most candidates shy away from mentioning their schooling on the campaign trail.
“Most folks who graduated from Harvard don’t walk around telling people that they graduated from Harvard,” says Mapp. “Sometimes they look at you like you’re sitting on top of the world or something. It’s not one to be thrown around.”
Goddard, who attended Harvard College before returning to his home state to earn a law degree at Arizona State University, says, “Here in Arizona, it would be a bigger local political advantage to go to one of the local universities.”
“I don’t wear it on my sleeve,” says Heidepriem, and Foley agrees, “I don’t mention it. People don’t want to hear about it from the candidate.”
However, Foley adds, “When they hear from other people that the candidate is a graduate of Harvard, I think it leaves a positive impression.”
Now that their school days are behind them, the candidates say that they have learned that politics is not always what it seems in an academic environment.
“I wish politics really worked the way it’s supposed to, the way we were taught at Harvard,” Berkowitz says. “It’s not as clean; it’s not as pure; and you get policy decisions that aren’t necessarily based on logical outcomes but more on expedience or self-interest. I think you need to remain an idealist and stay true to your principles and lead by example.”
“You need to watch for candidates who offer avenues to success,” he advises, “who want to talk about the issues in substantive ways. This isn’t a time for old-fashioned bland political rhetoric.”

With the official announcement of Undergraduate Council presidential tickets less than a week away, sources close to the candidates have confirmed that two Council insiders—Senan Ebrahim ’12 and Matthew S. Coe-Odess ’12—will face off for the presidency.
Ebrahim, who chairs the Student Life Committee, will partner with UC Secretary Bonnie Cao ’12 as the vice presidential candidate on the ticket. Coe-Odess, the Social Life Task Force Chair, will run with Tengbo Li ’12, the Council’s Education Committee Chair.
Both tickets bring years of UC experience to bear on the race, but the contest’s dynamics remain far from clear at this early stage.
“This year because they’re both on an even playing field, it’s hard to predict where it’s going to go,” said Finance Committee Chair Luis A. Martinez ’12. “There really is nobody who’s been the frontrunner.”
Ebrahim and Coe-Odess declined to comment for this article, citing election rules that prohibit campaigning before Nov. 8.
Having served on the Council since his freshman year, Ebrahim enters the race with the most Council experience. During that time, Ebrahim has worked under the auspices of the Student Life Committee to address issues of inter-House dining restrictions and the future of the Optional Winter Activities Week, better known as “J-Term.”
Coe-Odess joined the Council more recently after being elected to represent Kirkland House in September of last year.
Earlier this month, Coe-Odess, who was the UC Parliamentarian last semester, was selected to head the newly formed Social Life Task Force. In this position, he has worked to organize the upcoming Social Life Survey and the Game of the Week celebrations, an initiative that has attempted to increase student attendance at athletic events by giving out free food and T-shirts.
Although both tickets are made up of UC leadership, Coe-Odess and Ebrahim’s vice presidential candidates took on Council leadership positions more recently.
Since the start of the semester, Li has chaired the Education Committee, a body that has sought to improve undergraduate advising and worked on pre-term planning, the policy that requires College students to tentatively declare their course selection for the following semester.
Cao has focused on student services during her three semesters on the Council, particularly the UC TKTS program.
Martinez said that both platforms will most likely focus on social life, an issue that has been at the center of the final months of the current UC administration.
“They’re going to touch on similar themes,” Martinez said. “They’re going to be 80 percent the same.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s hockey team hopes that some fresh faces will make a big impact in keeping the puck out of the net this season.
The squad welcomes five new players—three defensemen and two goaltenders—onto the ice of Bright Hockey Center, and with their relentless work ethic and team-oriented mindset, the freshmen look to have great potential to help the Crimson build on last year’s 9-21-3 record and ninth-place ECAC regular-season finish.
“They’re a very strong group,” sophomore Alex Fallstrom says. “They came in here with a lot of strength, and they just wanted to take their spot on the team, and they don’t apologize for anything...I think they’re going to be great.”
The rookies are working hard to improve and to adjust to the college level of play, not only for their own benefit, but also for the betterment of the team.
“As freshmen, [they] have a lot to learn, but I think they’ve really pushed themselves so far,” says Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91.
“All of [the freshmen] are hardworking in practice and in the weight room,” freshman Dan Ford says. “Everyone wants to get better. [We] are taking extra time after practice to work on things, and [we] are just excited to be on the team and to try to contribute in any way we can.”
Although it is a small recruiting class in comparison to past seasons, the rookies are already bringing a lot to the rink in terms of their individual skills and strong backgrounds.
Ford, a defenseman, has had several years of experience in the United States Hockey League and opted to take a gap year before joining the Crimson this fall. He was recognized as an offensive-minded defenseman in his two years with the Sioux City Musketeers, being named the assistant captain and the defensive player of the year in his last season. He also played for and captained the Syracuse Stars of the Eastern Junior Hockey League and was selected as the league’s defensive player of the year.
“[Dan] has done a good job so far moving the puck and being sound defensively,” Donato says, going on to call him a “very solid stay-at-home guy.”
Ford is joined in the Harvard lineup by fellow freshman defensemen Danny Fick and John Caldwell.
Fick was a prominent player in the Upper Midwest High School Elite League and also captained his high school team to a Suburban East Conference championship. He was his team’s top scoring defenseman and MVP, the conference’s defenseman of the year, a two-time member of the all-conference team, and an all-state honorable mention.
Caldwell possesses similar leadership experience, being named the captain and MVP of his high school’s hockey team, as well as serving as captain of the Eastern Massachusetts Senators select team. He was also the recipient of the Best Pro Prospect award at the 2009 Hockey Night in Boston.
“Fick is a really great skater with a good work ethic, and Caldwell is a smart player who has good size and is also working hard to get better,” Ford says. Donato reiterates these comments by complimenting Caldwell’s, Fick’s, and Ford’s ability to skate and move the puck.
“[The] three defensemen...have all been impressive so far in the early going,” Donato says.
Fellow rookies Raphael Girard and Connor Riley are also looking to make a contribution between the pipes for the Crimson.
Girard posted a 26-6-3 record with a 1.55 goals-against average with his high school team. As a player for the College Antoine-Girouard Gaulois, he helped his squad have the league’s lowest goals-against average and was named the most valuable goaltender in the Quebec midget AAA, a first-team all-league selection, and his team’s most valuable player. He also attended Canada’s World Junior Challenge Tryout Camp as a member of Team East and was drafted by the Saint John Sea Dogs of the Quebec Junior Hockey League.
“Sometimes with goaltenders, there’s a difference in the level of shots they face in high school, [and] there is an adjustment period, but [Girard] seems to be making it very quickly,” Donato says.
Riley appears to be a similarly promising addition to the Harvard team, posting a 2.14 goals-against average and .921 save percentage for Deerfield Academy while also playing for Team Illinois in the Midwest Elite Hockey League.
All five Crimson rookies seem to be adjusting well to the level of college play and to the dynamics of the Harvard squad.
“Everybody looks good, everybody’s fitting in great, everybody’s getting along,” co-captain Michael Del Mauro says.
“There is really good chemistry on the team,” Ford adds. “[The team] welcomed the freshmen really well, and it’s been a great environment.”

Young and fast—those were two words Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 often used to describe his men’s hockey team last season. For the 2010-11 campaign, the Crimson will look to add another word to that description: mature.
“The guys are chomping at the bit to get going,” assistant captain Kyle Richter says. “We have a very positive outlook for the season. I think we’ve matured this year.”
Maturity, and the development of young talent, will be vital for Harvard’s attempt to climb back to the top of the ECAC. Last year, youth was the backbone of the Crimson offense—eight of Harvard’s top 11 goal scorers were underclassmen, and of those eight, six were freshmen.
Even before last season, the Crimson did have an idea that its young players would be major contributors. In fact, Inside College Hockey named Harvard’s freshman class the fifth-best group of recruits in the nation. Now sophomores, the skaters will try to break out even further.
“As far as the sophomore class goes, they’re all really mature, so any one of those guys could break out,” Richter says. “I’m really looking forward to seeing how those guys play.”
As the sophomore class looks to establish itself as a more powerful force in the ECAC, it must find a way to fill the skates of former classmate Louis Leblanc. During the offseason, the speedy forward left Harvard and signed a contract with the Montreal Canadiens, the team that selected the Kirkland, Quebec native in the first round of the 2009 draft.
“We wish him the best,” Donato says. “But on the other side of it, I have great confidence in the guys that are here and in their potential.”
Last season Leblanc led the team in points, goals, and plus-minus rating. His performance was impressive enough to earn him the Ivy League Rookie of the Year award.
“Of course the loss of Louis is a big loss, but it just means a lot of other guys have to step up...including me,” sophomore Alex Fallstrom says. “And I think all the guys appreciate that responsibility that they’re going to get.”
Fallstrom is in fact one of the sophomores with the potential to break out and fill the scoring void. The 6’2” forward, who was drafted in the fourth round of the 2009 NHL draft, registered four goals and eight assists last season.
“I feel like we have a really skilled class,” Fallstrom says. “I think we’re going to add a lot of speed and a lot of skill, and hopefully, a lot of goals.”
Another sophomore, Conor Morrison, will also try to build on a strong rookie performance.
The forward finished second on the team with 10 goals, including a four-score effort against Boston University.
Morrison and the rest of the sophomores should benefit from both learned team chemistry and a sense of familiarity with college hockey.
“As for freshman to sophomore year, I think you mature a lot more,” co-captain Chris Huxley says. “You feel more comfortable on the rink, you’ve been here for a year, and you know the protocol and the process. You just mature a bit and understand the game better.”
In the defensive zone, sophomore Danny Biega is poised to take on a greater leadership role. The 6’0” blueliner, who was drafted by the Carolina Hurricanes in the offseason, registered five goals last year. With the departure of former captain Alex Biega, Harvard will be looking for a defensive rock to emerge. Danny Biega and two other sophomore defensemen, David Valek and Brendan Rempel, will look to fill that role.
Rounding out the sophomore class are forwards Marshall Everson and Luke Greiner. Each scored three goals last season and is looking to increase his offensive impact.
A year later, last season’s freshmen now have become more experienced and more powerful. Whether that size will lead to more wins remains to be seen.
“They’ve all individually taken the summer to get bigger, stronger, faster,” Donato said. “They’ve looked like they’ve the made a significant jump from freshmen to sophomores, which is always what we hope for.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When they first walk into the Yard, many Harvard freshmen are expecting their college experience to be a stepping stone to the future. But for most athletes, these four years can represent the culmination of everything they’ve been working towards. The women’s hockey players are no exception.
“Apart from the Olympic team...this is our NHL,” freshman Lyndsey Fry says. “For most of us, this is as far as it’s going to go. And walking into that locker room, it’s like, ‘This is it. This is why we’ve been playing so long, and this is what we’ve been working for.’”
The seven freshmen of the women’s hockey team—Fry, Jackie Young, Marissa Gedman, Lauren Joarnt, Kalley Armstrong, Gina McDonald, and Elizabeth Parker—are, on paper, a hodgepodge of individuals. Some come from traditional hockey hotbeds like Minnesota and Ontario, while others grew up off the beaten hockey path. Two were high school teammates, while several hadn’t crossed paths before college.
But even after less than two months in crimson, the septet has already found two things it has in common: the seven women love playing hockey, and they love spending time together.
“We just have a lot of strong personalities that are a lot of fun, and they mesh very well,” Fry says. “So it’s just kind of crazy a lot of times. We’re always laughing.”
The freshman class comes in with one of the most impressive collective resumes of any recruiting class over the last few years. Three of the seven—Fry, Young, and Gedman—have played for the U.S. U-18 national team.
“You go to the development camps that so many girls go to...but you never think that you’ll be the one,” Young says. “And so to get that opportunity and be able to put that jersey on was amazing, something you’ll never forget.”
Young and Fry won gold at the 2009 world championships, and Fry and Gedman earned silver at the 2010 event. Though Young and Gedman were never teammates on the national team, the defensemen are no strangers—in fact, they were teammates at the Noble and Greenough School in Dedham, Mass. for the last three seasons.
The three national team veterans bring an added level of experience to the team in their first collegiate season. That familiarity with high-level hockey paid dividends in Harvard’s exhibition match with McGill last weekend, when Fry and Young each assisted on one of senior Katharine Chute’s goals.
“It helps,” Crimson coach Katey Stone says of the U-18 experience. “It’s just one more transition step that they have that makes it a little bit easier for them to get here, and you’ll see it. They’ll step into roles pretty quickly, because they can handle the pressure and they can handle the intensity.”
Fry and Young both agree that playing with the U-18 team has given them an early advantage as they learn Harvard’s hockey system.
“It was a level that is the same as the DI level, because you can tell that everyone’s there for the same goal,” Young says. “You want to be the best, you want to practice like you’re the best, and the coaches push you to that level, and everyone’s on the same page. And that really helped me prepare for college.”
But all seven of the Crimson freshmen are looking to make an impact this season—and all seven got a chance to skate in the 2-2 tie with the Martlets last Saturday.
“In general, I think it’s an extremely talented class,” tri-captain Leanna Coskren says. “They’re going to be given some responsibilities right away, and I think they can handle them.”
Gedman and Young will help anchor the young defense, while goaltender Joarnt is learning the ropes between the pipes as the backup to sophomore Laura Bellamy.
“There’s a lot of skill in that group,” Bellamy says. “They’re dangerous players, especially Gedman with her shot from the point. Jackie has done a good job with her size and strength.”
Meanwhile, Fry is joined by McDonald, Armstrong, and Parker on the offensive unit, where they are learning from some talented veterans.
“For the most part, all of the freshmen are thrown in with the upperclassmen—it’s not like we’re all on one line together,” Fry explains. “And I love it. Every practice, every play, they’re always trying to get us better.”
But so far, the biggest contribution the freshmen have made to Harvard hockey is the fresh energy they bring to the team.
“They’re characters,” Stone admits. “Trust me—they’re characters. We’ve had a lot of fun off the ice already.”
Fry and Young can’t help but laugh when asked about their off-ice antics, recalling a recent team dinner at Coskren’s house when Fry began playing the piano as her classmates sang Christmas carols—in the middle of October.
“There were literally times at that dinner when I was laughing to the point where I couldn’t breathe,” Fry says. “It’s just the silliest stuff, but we never have a dull moment.”
“And I think the main reason we have so much fun is because we know we can feel comfortable with the team,” Young adds. “If we didn’t feel so comfortable, I don’t think we would be as much of ourselves.”
Stone hopes that the evident off-ice chemistry will translate into on-ice results for her youngest players.
“They’re great kids,” she says. “First things first, we recruit great kids and people that are going to be a fine addition to the locker room. I mean, everybody’s different, and we want kids who love the diversity. But the number one thing is, they’ve got to be a great teammate first.”
As the seven rookies look to find their role on the team, the chance to be a part of Harvard hockey is already a dream come true in itself.
“Just seeing the jersey in the locker with the ‘Harvard’ on it, and your name on the back...it’s similar to the feeling you get when you play for the USA team,” Young says. “It’s something you dream of as a kid, and like I said, you look up to those girls that do it, and then you’re finally there, and the jersey has your name on it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Before she was elected tri-captain of the Harvard women’s hockey team, before she spent the summer with the national team, and before she became an All-ECAC selection and nominee for the Patty Kazmaier Award, Leanna Coskren was the baby of a hockey-playing family who was always trying to keep up with her bigger and stronger older brothers. It wasn’t easy—all four brothers went on to play Division I hockey.
“I guess growing up I was always trying to do everything they did and whatnot, and so that’s how I got into hockey,” Coskren says.
Not surprisingly, Coskren’s big brothers weren’t exactly excited about having their little sister tagging along.
“We certainly didn’t make it easy on her growing up,” recalls brother Nick ’09, a former forward for the men’s team. “We always gave her a hard time, us being older boys...It led to a few fights. Sometimes she would want to play, and we wouldn’t want to let her. She would play anyway...she didn’t really experience much success in the household. In the long run, obviously, it’s worked out for her.”
Coskren’s hunger for challenges carried into her organized hockey as well. Unsatisfied with the level of hockey on local girls’ teams, she signed up to play with the boys.
“If you wanted to play competitively, you basically had to play on boys’ teams,” the Massachusetts native explains. “So I played on two at the same time, and I was the only girl on both teams, and usually the only girl in the league most of the time...[Girls’ hockey] got more competitive as I got older, but I still played on the boys’ teams until I got to high school.”
When she finally started playing with girls, Coskren immediately went from underdog to top high school player. She was named all-league in the Independent School League all four years. With Coskren on the blue line, Noble and Greenough won four ISL titles and two New England Championships, making the finals a third year.
“She always had this uphill climb,” Nick says. “She always competed with us. Then when she started playing girls her own age, she had this edge...she had this leg up on other girls.”
But emerging as a star in her own right didn’t make Coskren forget about the big brothers who had helped her on the way, albeit unintentionally. While all four had played a role in toughening her up, brothers Mike ’09 and Nick would influence her in another way—helping her choose a college.
“I’d definitely say that their choices influenced me,” she says. “They would tell me for two years what [Harvard] was like, what their hockey was like. I’d come in every so often...I was able to see the school for myself. And then, I’m really close with my family, so having them here was definitely, it was an influential factor.”
Just as in high school, the youngest Coskren was quick to make an impact on the ice.
“She’s been awesome for us since she got here,” Crimson coach Katey Stone says.
In her first two years at Bright Hockey Center, Coskren earned her reputation as a defensive stalwart.
“She’s one of the smartest defensemen I’ve coached,” Stone says. “The way she feels pressure and reads the game is tremendous.”
But it wasn’t until her junior year that Coskren made the jump from a solid blue-line player to a star at both ends of the ice.
“Junior year is when I kind of put both [offense and defense] together, and it’s when I was able to become a consistent defender but also help contribute offensively,” she reflects.
Her emergence couldn’t have been better timed. With Harvard having graduated its top three scorers from the year before and with spark plug Liza Ryabkina injured during the first part of the season, Coskren proved to be a welcome addition to the Crimson’s offense in 2009. But it was back on the blue line where the skater made her biggest impact. Already a leader on the defensive end, Coskren took on even more responsibility when then-senior goaltender Christina Kessler sustained a season-ending injury. Rather than be undone by the injury, Coskren and co-captains Kathryn Farni ’10 and Cori Bassett ’10 helped current sophomore Laura Bellamy assimilate into net, and Harvard didn’t miss a beat, earning home ice advantage in the NCAA tournament.
“Leanna and Cori Bassett really took the lead and showed people what needed to be done on the ice and were shut-down defenders,” tri-captain Kate Buesser says.
Coskren’s efforts did not go unnoticed; she was named a second-team All-Ivy selection, a third-team All-ECAC selection, and a nominee for the Patty Kazmaier Award. The then-junior also garnered an invitation to join the national team for the summer.
Her efforts didn’t escape the notice of her family either. Once her rivals, Coskren’s brothers have become some of her biggest supporters.
“Now it’s completely different,” Nick says. “I think she’s a very talented player...I usually talk to her on the day and the day before games. I’m always telling her to be more offensive...trying to build her confidence. When she was trying out with the U.S. national team, I would text her, ‘You belong there, don’t be intimidated by the other girls.’”
While Coskren still relies on her brothers for guidance and support, she’s become one of the senior authorities in her second hockey family—the Crimson.
“As a goalie, I love her because I know she’s going to take care of the puck,” Bellamy says. “She’s been great with showing the underclassmen the right mentality...just to keep the puck away from the net. Her poise and calm on the ice are going to settle the underclassmen quite a bit.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a sport known for flashy playmaking and hard-hitting brawls, it’s easy to overlook the guy in the back minding the net. Goaltending may not be the most glamorous position in hockey, but in that role—perhaps more than any other—an individual can have a profound impact on whether a game is won or lost.
Senior netminder Kyle Richter’s career on the Harvard men’s hockey team certainly reflects this phenomenon.
After leading the team to the finals of the 2008 ECAC tournament and winning the Ken Dryden Award as the top goaltender in the league his sophomore year, Richter left Cambridge on a year-long leave of absence. His return to the Crimson crease, however, was tougher than anticipated.
“Last year was definitely difficult getting back into it, but I tried to approach it the same as any other year,” Richter recalls. “It was definitely a little different having the time off.”
Richter’s struggles in the first part of last season mirrored those of the team. After defeating Dartmouth, 5-3, in its first game of the season, Harvard went 0-8-2 in its next 10 matchups. In that same time period, Richter fought to hold the Crimson’s starting position and ended up sharing the job with classmate Ryan Carroll.
But by the end of the season, the talented Richter began to look a lot like his old self. He made a total of 70 saves as Harvard swept Princeton in the first round of the ECAC playoffs. In the second game of that series, Richter earned just the fifth shutout of his career, helping the Crimson defeat the Tigers, 3-0, and move on to the quarterfinals of the tournament.
“I eventually found my stride again and leading towards the end of last year, we really got in a good groove as a team,” Richter says.
Harvard will need Richter at his best this year as it seeks a return to the top of the ECAC and an NCAA tournament berth. During the 2007-08 campaign—during which Harvard finished second in the league—Richter started all 34 games for the Crimson and wrote his name all over the Harvard record books. That year, Richter notched a league-best .935 save percentage and 1.82 goals-against average. He also became the first goalie in Crimson history to score a goal in a 6-1 win against Yale.
Those statistics also helped Richter become the first Harvard goalie to earn a spot on the All-Ivy League first team since 2000.
But in addition to his role as the anchor of the Crimson’s defensive effort, Richter will have a new job this year as the team’s assistant captain.
It’s a rare job for a goaltender—Richter is the first to serve as a captain or assistant for Harvard in over 30 years—but the senior is more than ready to step into the role and help co-captains Michael Del Mauro and Chris Huxley lead the Crimson.
“We have a goalie who’s our assistant captain, which you don’t see often,” junior forward Alex Killorn says. “[Richter]’s always been a leader in the locker room. Huxley is more of a leader on the ice, whereas Del Mauro is a very vocal leader. Together they’re going to work really well.”
“I like to be as involved as possible off the ice, because in practice I can’t be as involved as the goalie,” Richter adds. “That’s where Del Mauro and Huxley come into play a little more. Overall, it’s really leadership by committee.”
And ultimately, despite all of his individual accolades and the specialized nature of his role as a goaltender, it really comes down to the team for Richter.
“My personal goals really tie into our team goals,” he says. “Our goal is to win the league and the Beanpot. That’s bigger than any personal goal I can think of. I just want to bring a consistent presence.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s that time of year again. As the temperature drops and the leaves start to change, people begin to question why there is already “snow” near the athletic fields across the river. The answer is simple: it’s almost hockey season.
In the final days before games begin for Ivy League teams, the Harvard men’s hockey team is gearing up for the start of its new campaign. The Crimson hopes to improve upon last year’s roller-coaster season, in which Harvard finished ninth in the ECAC with an overall record of 9-21-3 (7-12-3 ECAC).
“I think overall we have very high expectations for the season, with the players we have from last year maturing a little bit,” junior forward Alex Killorn says. “We’re a little disappointed by the way things ended last year, so we’ve been working really hard this summer.”
Despite several disappointing losses in 2009-10, including being swept by Cornell in the ECAC quarterfinals, the Crimson did some good things last season. Just before losing to the Big Red, Harvard ousted Princeton in two games in the first round of the ECAC Championships. The Crimson also claimed a four-game win streak in league play near the middle of the season and posted an impressive 3-2 victory over eventual regular-season champion Yale.
“[This season] our goal is to win every game, but, more importantly, to get better every day and learn from our mistakes,” says co-captain Chris Huxley, who led Harvard defenders last season with 13 points.
The team will face the first of many challengers on Monday, as the 2010-11 campaign begins with a matchup against the Swedish U-20 national team.
This year, while recent favorites look to maintain their dominance in the ECAC, the Crimson will attempt to re-establish itself at the top of the conference. Two-time defending ECAC champion Yale is predicted to win the league once again, while Cornell and Union are preseason favorites as well.
Even with these tough tests looming ahead for Harvard, the Crimson is taking its season just one game at a time.
“Before you play anyone, you can’t really say [who the biggest competition is],” Huxley says. “Every team is going to be the toughest. You can’t really single out one game as being the most important, because, when it comes down to it, all of the games are equally important.”
This is especially true for Harvard, because, due to the nature of the ECAC, the five non-Ivy League competitors in the conference have their first few games under their belt already. The Crimson’s second contest, and first league test, comes against Union (5-1, 0-0), which has gotten off to a strong start.
“They just get a little bit of a head start,” sophomore forward Luke Greiner says. “I don’t think in the long run it makes a big difference, but definitely in the beginning [of the season] we’re going to have to adjust a little bit quicker than they might have to in order to come out prepared.”
Harvard will begin the season without several key players from last year’s squad.
The Crimson graduated six seniors, including last year’s captain, Alex Biega. Louis Leblanc, who paced last year’s team with 11 goals and 12 assists, will not return for Harvard either after signing with the Montreal Canadiens for the upcoming season.
Luckily for the Crimson, reinforcements are available.
“Freshmen play a big role on this team, on any team,” Huxley says. “It’s a big step from wherever they came from—high school or junior hockey...There’s a little adjustment period, but the goal is to make the adjustment period as short as possible for each guy.”
Harvard returns strong leaders in co-captains Michael Del Mauro and Huxley, along with assistant captain Kyle Richter. The Crimson also boasts a core of 21 players from last season, including senior forward Michael Biega and sophomore defender Danny Biega. Every player is expected to contribute to the team’s leadership.
“One of the focuses of our team this year is that everybody’s going to have a leadership role and a following role,” Del Mauro says. “So it’s going to be different people at different times [stepping] up.”
“We have some good team chemistry,” Huxley adds. “We’ve had about a month or two together, which is a good amount of time to get to know each other. Everyone’s been working hard and getting better every day, and that’s what’s important.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Going into last season, some people doubted how well the Harvard women’s ice hockey team would perform, but a Beanpot championship, an undefeated nonconference record, and a Division I coaching record proved the team could hold its own.
This year, the Crimson is looking to build and improve upon those achievements as it takes to the ice for the 2010-11 season.
“I hope [last year] motivates us,” Harvard coach Katey Stone says. “[It was] disappointing how it ended, but a lot of really positive things came out of last year.”
Even with Harvard’s impressive record (20-8-5, 13-6-3 ECAC) and home-ice advantage in the NCAA tournament, the team was unhappy about closing out the year with losses in the ECAC semifinals and the NCAA quarterfinals. A lineup riddled by injuries caused the Crimson to falter towards the end of its schedule, but Harvard has remained healthy heading into the upcoming season.
“Our success will largely be determined by being able to stay healthy,” Stone says.
One of the biggest hits to last year’s squad was when goaltender Christina Kessler ’10 had her collegiate career ended abruptly by a torn ACL midway through January. As devastating as the loss seemed, it allowed for the development of goaltender Laura Bellamy, now a sophomore slated to start in net for the Crimson this season.
“A lot of kids stepped up in situations that maybe we didn’t expect,” Stone says.
Other underclassmen that proved themselves as rookies in the 2009-10 season include sophomores Jillian Dempsey and Josephine Pucci, who will both take on larger roles this year.
Dempsey scored 11 goals as a forward for Harvard last season and was named to the ECAC All-Rookie Team and All-Ivy Second Team. Pucci, a strong presence on the defense, played with the 2010 U.S. Women’s U-22 Select Team this summer and was chosen to play in November’s Four Nations Cup.
The Crimson is also boosted by a strong class of rookies that the team hopes will be able to contribute quickly on the ice.
“They were all highly-skilled, highly-recruited players in high school, and they have a lot of size and a lot of poise with the puck,” tri-captain Kate Buesser says. “We’re just trying to get them to shift into the speed of the game, but we have a lot of confidence in them going forward.”
Buesser, fellow tri-captains Leanna Coskren and Liza Ryabkina, and the rest of the senior class also add to a strong returning lineup. Ryabkina missed the beginning of the 2010-11 campaign with a dislocated knee, but if she can stay healthy this year, she and Buesser will add energy and experience to the Harvard offense.
“[Ryabkina] is a lightning bolt on our roster,” Stone says. “She’s got a great game, and [it’s about] just keeping it simple and taking advantage of the unbelievable skills that she has and when to use them.”
Buesser is coming off of a breakout season in which she led the team with 40 points, more than double her previous career high, and was a top-three finalist for the ECAC Player of the Year award.
While the team has worked especially hard in the preseason to make everything come together, several Harvard players took initiative over the summer to prepare and train on their own.
“One of the things I think I’m most pleased about is how well our returning players came back in shape,” Stone says. “They were in great condition and really took our words to heart. [They] put a lot of responsibility on themselves to get in the best possible condition.”
With its roster ready to go, the Crimson can now focus on the finer points of play as it faces an ever-improving group of ECAC teams.
Cornell, a team that surprised everyone by winning the ECAC and making a run all the way to the national championship game in 2010, is even stronger this season with an added year’s experience for its young stars and the return of Olympic gold medalist Rebecca Johnston. But the conference has more parity than ever before, with new forces like Quinnipiac and Clarkson challenging perennial powerhouses St. Lawrence, Harvard, and Dartmouth—a team that didn’t even make the ECAC playoff cut last season.
“Every team is good, so good,” Stone says. “[You’ve] got to have structure to what you’re trying to do and be able to show up every night. If you don’t show up, you’re going to have trouble, and you’re going to get stung.”
The nonconference slate isn’t any easier for the Crimson, as it travels to Minnesota and faces a host of top local teams. But with a healthy squad of new and returning talent, Harvard is ready to take on this year’s challenging schedule of opponents.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the ice, experience can be any hockey team’s seventh player.  For Harvard goaltender Laura Bellamy, experience will be the key to success in her sophomore season.
Bellamy unexpectedly became the starting goalie during her freshman year after standout keeper Christina Kessler ’10 suffered a season-ending injury midway through the Crimson’s schedule. With big skates to fill, the then-freshman stepped up to the challenge in a big way, racking up 326 saves and recording a save percentage of .921 and a 1.69 goals-against average in the final 18 games of the season, helping her team earn a berth in the NCAA tournament.
For Bellamy, this year is about coming back, with game experience under her belt, and doing even better.
“I want to win a national championship,” the sophomore says. “I want to build off last year. I got a lot of experience as a freshman and want to use that to the team’s advantage and really be a leader out there.”
Last year, Harvard produced 20 wins and secured its 13th Beanpot championship. This year’s squad currently ranks ninth nationally heading into tonight’s opener.
With the majority of the team consisting of a promising but young group of underclassmen, Bellamy’s leadership on the ice will be needed.
“It’s really different now, because she’s the one,” Crimson coach Katey Stone says. “There’s no Kessler...and so now [Bellamy] is already in this sort of mentor, leadership role.”
Bellamy’s first career start came in a game against Princeton on Jan. 8, in which the sophomore made 13 saves in a 3-3 tie with the Tigers. Her first career shutout, the first of three during her rookie season, came soon after, in a 4-0 win over Union on Jan. 22. During the Beanpot, Bellamy recorded 42 saves in two shutouts and was named the Bertagna Award winner as the tournament’s top goaltender.
Despite her accolades as a rookie, the real gain of Bellamy’s season came down again to experience.
“[Bellamy] came in at the end of the season, which is really pressure-filled,” tri-captain Kate Buesser says. “I think the greatest thing was getting that experience.”
“Getting into games is so different from practicing day in and day out,” Bellamy adds. “Just having a feel for that is so important and not something I have to learn now.”
Bellamy’s experience came with a price: an injury to a record-setting keeper.
But though Kessler could no longer play, she still served as a kind of guide to the rookie.
“Kessler was a big part of my transition,” the sophomore says. “While rehabbing, she was a huge mentor for me. Even when she was out, she was helping me learn the position and the mental side of it.”
Bellamy will need to know both the physical and mental aspects of her position as her team faces some of the top squads in the nation in the upcoming season. The Crimson’s schedule includes six teams that finished last season ranked in the national top 10, including No. 2 Cornell and No. 6 Minnesota.
“You have to have good goalkeeping...and show up every night,” Stone says. “We want to play the toughest schedule we can...because the more situations we can put our players in, the better they’re going to be down the road.”
“Down the road” will ideally include a ninth trip to the NCAA tournament, and the end to which Bellamy aspires, a national championship.
For Stone, in order to reach that goal, the young netminder needs to develop a sense of confidence, bordering even on overconfidence.
“Goalies have to...play with a little bit of cockiness because that makes them bigger, that makes them more imposing,” Stone says. “She certainly has the skill set to be a Division I goaltender. It’s just a matter of her just...having a little bit of an attitude.”
With a successful freshman season, and the experience that came with it, behind her, Bellamy no doubt has the ability to play with more confidence than she did as a rookie who came onto the ice in the place of a senior star.
But for the team to succeed, Bellamy’s game experience can’t manifest itself in attitude alone—the team now looks to her for leadership as well.
“It’s time to take the leadership role,” Bellamy says. “There are no more questions about what the college hockey world is like, but it’s much more important to produce and win games.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dartmouth hasn’t posed much of a challenge for Harvard football in recent years.
Over the past five seasons, the Crimson has dominated its Ivy League rivals, going 5-0 and outscoring the Big Green by an average of over 22 points per game.
But tomorrow in Hanover, N.H., Harvard (4-2, 2-1 Ivy) could find things significantly tougher against a much-improved Dartmouth (4-2, 1-2) squad.
“They’ve grown up,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said of the opposition. “They’re a big, physical, aggressive team. When they were competitive a year ago, they just couldn’t finish; now they’ve finished games...They have the people, the personnel, and the scheme to play with anybody in our league. It’s clear they’re the most improved team.”
The Crimson’s chances for success will begin at quarterback. After senior Andrew Hatch threw two interceptions last week against Princeton, he was benched in favor of junior Collier Winters—2009’s second-team All-Ivy QB—who made an unexpected return to action after missing the season’s first five contests with a torn labrum.
Murphy said Winters would get the call tomorrow­—making him the team’s third starting quarterback this season–and for the foreseeable future.
“Collier’s our guy,” Murphy said. “We don’t foresee any circumstances where that would change.”
Winters will look for continued reliable play from sophomore tight end Kyle Juszczyk, who has 11 receptions and three touchdowns in his past two games. Junior wideout Adam Chrissis leads the team with 251 receiving yards on the year.
But Harvard hasn’t had to rely on its passing game very much in recent weeks, thanks to the superb play of running back duo Gino Gordon and Treavor Scales.
Gordon rushed for 204 yards against the Tigers—his fourth consecutive hundred-plus yard effort—propelling him into the league’s lead in yards and earning him Ivy Player of the Week honors. The senior ranks second nationally with 7.8 yards-per-carry and is the Crimson’s all-time leader in that statistic.
“Gino is arguably the premier player in our league this year, and one of the premier players in the country in the FCS,” Murphy said.
Scales added a career-high 134 yards against Princeton, placing him second in the conference and 10th in the nation in yards-per-carry. The running game will try to control the ball against a Big Green squad that has only averaged 27 minutes of possession per contest on the year.
“We started off as a pass-first team, but lately we’ve been a run-first team, and now we intend to be a balanced team,” Murphy said. “We’re going to make people defend all aspects of our offense...we like to be in a position where we can dictate what we want to do.”
Dartmouth has a solid running game of its own, led by junior Nick Schwieger, who leads the Ancient Eight with 141.8 yards per game and seven scores. Classmate Connor Kempe has provided stability at quarterback, throwing for 180 yards per game and seven touchdowns. The duo is protected by a strong offensive line that has only allowed one sack this season.
“First and foremost our plan is to stop the run,” junior cornerback Matthew Hanson said. “That’s always our plan of attack–to stop the run and make our opponent one-dimensional.”
The Big Green offense has combined for 27.2 points per game, second in the Ancient Eight to Harvard’s 29.7.
But the Dartmouth defense has been another story, allowing 22.8 points and a league-high 232.8 passing yards per contest.
These struggles are the reason Dartmouth has already lost two close league games to Penn and Yale. Cornerback Shawn Abuhoff leads Dartmouth with three interceptions.
The Crimson defense, led by captain Collin Zych and defensive end Benjamin Graeff, ranks second in the Ivy after Penn. Graeff leads the conference with five sacks while Zych is fifth with 55 tackles. But the team has allowed nearly 25 points per game in conference play.
“Our concern is not just to stop the run, its to stop their offense,” Murphy said.  “We’ve got to be much more disciplined on the back-end of our defense if we’re going to beat Dartmouth.”
The game—which will be televised on NESN—will represent the 114th meeting between the rivals, and Harvard is 12-1 in its previous 13 games against the Big Green. But the Crimson knows that this year’s Dartmouth squad—whose four wins are already its second-most in 13 years—cannot be taken lightly.
“They’re definitely better,” Hanson said. “Just watching the film, they’re a very balanced team. They execute their game plan well. We’ve just got to play our style of football and not make mistakes.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Senior Alan Palmer first became hooked on sailing as a nine-year-old cruising the coast of Maine with his parents.
After years of challenging competition, he came to Harvard three years ago ready to make his mark on collegiate sailing.
“We were the young guys, like the ones in ‘The Mighty Ducks 3,’ where they beat the varsity team,” Palmer said of himself and the team’s other freshmen. “So that was our whole thing: we knew we were just going to do really, really good.”
At the start of his debut regatta, it looked as if Palmer and his teammates might follow through with their promise. But things didn’t go quite as planned.
“We were winning the race, right at the finish line,” Palmer remembers, “and then all of a sudden we just all flip.”
Luckily, the Crimson’s opponents lost control at about the same time, giving Palmer a chance to reclaim the win.
But as soon as his boat was ready to go, they flipped again—this time just short of the finish line, resulting in a last-place result.
“You could hear the coaches in the background, and they were just laughing hysterically saying, ‘Oh my god, these guys are so bad,’” Palmer says. “But now it’s kind of funny because we’re all sailing together again and actually doing well.”
In fact, Palmer and his Harvard teammates are doing great.
After being named US Sailing’s Sailor of the Week two weeks ago, Palmer led the Crimson to a victory at the Captain Hurst Bowl, skippering all 14 races in the A division.
But Palmer’s talent isn’t limited to just his sport.
“Alan Palmer is a legend,” senior roommate Dillon Powers says. “He’s one of the smartest people—if not the smartest person—I’ve ever met at Harvard.”
As an applied mathematics concentrator, Palmer excels in statistics as well as a number of other challenging fields.
After deciding to take CS50 last year, Palmer found that he had an uncanny gift for programming, and in one of the problem set competitions easily beat out his entire section.
“On the investment trading pset I found a bug in the program where you could instantly make, like, quadrillions of dollars,” Palmer says with a laugh. “So I just exploited that until I was winning…I’m pretty competitive, I like to win.”
“Everything is a game for him, and the odds are always on his side,” Powers adds.
And even with the odds in his favor, Palmer is clearly willing to do whatever it takes to attain victory—including dedicating the majority of last January-term to becoming the best in the world at SailX, an online sailing video game.
“It’s kind of like a tactic simulator so it’s pretty cool,” Palmer describes. “I started playing it the winter of my sophomore year when someone showed it to me, and then I just played it an awful lot—way more than I should have.”
After playing the game for two to three hours a day over the break, Palmer finally reached the pinnacle of SailX players worldwide.
“I mean there are guys in the middle of nowhere who will just play SailX and don’t do anything with their lives,” Powers says. “But somehow Alan still became number one.”
With his goal accomplished, Palmer made a strategic exit from the online sailing world.
“I could really only go down from there,” Palmer says. “So I retired on top.”
Nowadays Palmer focuses his competitive spirit on FIFA (and real sailing, of course), along with the position at J.P. Morgan he will begin after graduation this spring.
But if Wall Street doesn’t work out, Palmer’s roommates have another plan in mind.
“If I were to go to Vegas, I would take Alan with me to ask him what to do,” Powers says. “I feel like he would know how to cheat the casinos out of millions and million of dollars.”
He basically did it in CS50, so who’s to say it won’t work in the real world?

The time has finally arrived.
This Friday, the Ancient Eight’s cross-country teams will travel to Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx, N.Y., to compete in the Heptagonal Championships and to fight for the right to be called Ivy League champions.
“It’s always exciting since it’s the Ivy League, and you want to dominate all the other schools,” senior Claire Richardson said. “This is an opportunity to show how hard we’ve been working.”
After a season of strong individual and team performances, the Crimson will be put to the toughest test of all, as it faces formidable competition in its search for the title.
Currently ranked 18th in the nation, the Princeton women are looking to capture their fifth consecutive Ivy League title.
The Tigers return three of the top five runners who led them to victory in last season’s championships.
Cornell and Columbia, currently ranked fifth and seventh in the Northeast Region, respectively, also pose a serious threat to dethrone the reigning titleholder.
One thing is for certain: a new individual champion will be crowned.
Last year’s victor, Princeton’s Liz Costello, was a graduating senior, providing extra incentive for the competitors.
“The biggest challenge is staying focused, because it’s really easy to get overexcited,” Richardson said. “The Ivy League is competitive, and there are a lot of teams working for the top spot.”
Harvard hopes to pose a strong challenge for the title and to build off last year’s sixth-place finish, which saw three runners awarded All-Ivy League status.
The Crimson was led by Richardson, who recorded the eighth-fastest time in the women’s team’s history at the meet, but Richardson will not be running this year, due to a stress fracture.
She remains confident that her teammates will more than make up for her absence after the squad’s strong showing this season, peaking at 31st in the nation.
“I hope that they will work together, stay confident, believe in themselves, and have fun,” Richardson said. “If they do all of those things, they’ll do their best.”
While the Harvard men’s team  also looks to improve upon last year’s sixth-place finish, Dan Chenoweth has an additional goal: to defend his title as the individual reigning champion.
Chenoweth was last year’s top overall finisher with a time of 25:09 for the 8k course, becoming the first Crimson male to take the title in 14 years.
If he succeeds in defending his crown, he will be the first repeat Ivy League champion since 2005-06.
But it won’t be easy, since all of the top six finishers from last year will be returning to compete in this year’s championship.
“It’s interesting because so many of the guys are coming back,” Chenoweth said. “Some of those guys have gotten a lot better from last year, so it will make things more challenging. I’m making sure that I adjust my strategy so that I don’t underestimate anyone.”
He appears to be ready for the challenge after a season of strong results, including a third-place finish at this year’s NCAA Cross Country National Championships.
After being plagued with injuries to upperclassmen all season, the men’s team will continue to depend on its younger talent to fill out the top five with some strong results.
“We have a lot of young guys, and they’ve never been to a race like this,” Chenoweth said. “The biggest challenge that they’ll face is applying what they’ve learned to this race and the races in the next weeks.”
Columbia reclaimed the team title last year for the first time since 2004, breaking Princeton’s three-year streak, and the Lions hope to defend their position with the return of four of the top five runners from the meet.
Princeton, currently ranked 18th nationally, is a strong contender to reclaim the title.
With tough competitors facing both the men’s and women’s teams, the Harvard squads will have their work cut out for them.
But as the Crimson is fully aware, with any big meet comes the opportunity for big results.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend proves to be an exciting one, with four Harvard teams traveling to Dartmouth to take on the Big Green and other teams playing home matches for Crimson fans to enjoy.
Football stays on the road, traveling to Dartmouth this weekend, three weeks before the biggest Game of the year. The Crimson face off against the Big Green tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., looking to pick up its third conference victory. Last time out, the Crimson’s offense led the team to victory with a 45-28 win over Princeton to bring the team record to 4-2. Dartmouth also won last weekend, narrowly defeating Columbia, 24-21, but Harvard has won 12 of the last 13 meetings with Dartmouth and seeks to continue this dominant record.
The men’s soccer squad also travels to Hanover, N.H. to take on the Big Green tomorrow evening at 7 p.m. The Crimson, 4-5-5 overall, is on a two-game losing streak and looks to turn the season around in its fifth conference match. Dartmouth stands at 6-6-1 for the season, seemingly putting the teams on level playing field. Last season, Harvard scored a victory at home over Dartmouth, 2-1, but in the last four meetings, each team stands at two wins apiece.
Also in Hanover for the weekend, the women’s soccer team will challenge the Big Green tomorrow afternoon at 4 p.m. The women have a winning record, but just barely, going 7-6-1 so far. Contrary to the men’s team, the women are on a two-game winning streak, recording those victories against Quinnipiac and Princeton. Harvard is 2-0-1 in its last three matches against its Ivy League rival.
The final squad heading to Dartmouth is the field hockey team, taking on the Big Green tomorrow at 1 p.m. The team has increased its losing streak to seven, dropping its past two matches to Princeton and Boston College. Last season, the Crimson went down to Dartmouth, 5-3, and the Big Green has won the last two meetings against Harvard.
The cross-country team traveled to Van Cortlandt Park in Bronx, N.Y. for today’s annual Heptagonal Championships. Last year at this event, captain Daniel Chenoweth took first in the 8k race, leading the men to a sixth-place finish overall. The team repeated its sixth-place performance this year, but Chenoweth fell short of defending his title, placing second overall. The Harvard women placed fifth at Heps.
The men’s tennis squad hosts the Big Crimson Halloween Invitational today through Sunday. Action starts with the first round of singles and doubles this afternoon, with the finals taking place on Sunday. Junior Ali Felton and sophomore Andy Nguyen will team up again after winning the doubles crown at the ITA Northeast Regional Championships two weeks ago.
In other Harvard sports action, the women’s volleyball team goes to Cornell and Columbia this weekend, after notching wins over both teams at home earlier this season. The women will compete against Columbia tonight at 7 p.m. and against Cornell tomorrow evening at 5 p.m. The women’s ice hockey squad kicks off its home season tonight and tomorrow afternoon, taking on Yale and Brown. Finally, the men’s lightweight crew team travels to the annual Princeton Chase event.

To conclude our series on final clubs, we thought we’d take a quick little tour through the history of the clubs’ diversity. “We pride ourselves on the diversity of our club,” one member of the Phoenix wrote to us in an e-mailed statement. “And we define diversity to include race, socio-economic status, concentration, extra-curriculars, etc.” He added that the Phoenix has “some members from royal families and others whose parents are unemployed.”
Make what you will of that, but what did diversity in the clubs look like 50 years ago?  Or 100 years ago?  Here’s a timeline of selected events in the final clubs’ particular histories of exclusivity and inclusivity.
 
1912-1918 – No Jews are admitted to The Porcellian, the A.D., the Fly, the Spee, and the Delphic during these years, according to Jerome Karabel’s “The Chosen: the Hidden History of Admission at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton.” 
1938 – The Spee Club accepts John F. Kennedy ’40 in an era when many of the Final Clubs do not accept Catholics.
1965 – The Spee Club becomes the first final club to admit an African-American, Frank M. Snowden ’68. In response, William C. Coleman III ’66, president of the Delphic Club, told The Crimson, “I don't want to say that this is a precedent that all the clubs at Harvard should follow, or that the Delphic Club is definitely going to take in a Negro, or a Chinese, or whatever. I think as far as the clubs are concerned within the context of Harvard University, this is a good thing. It is an indication that clubs are not as exclusive—in any sense, not just racially—as people have tended to think they are."
1983 – The Porcellian Club admits its first black member, William Batts ’Jr. ’86.
1983 – Deval L. Patrick ’78, the first African-American governor of Massachusetts, claims to have quit the Fly Club.
1984 – The University severs its ties to the final clubs when they refuse to admit women. This meant that the clubs would be denied access to Harvard’s steam heat, alumni mailing lists, sophomore housing lists, and central telephone service.
1986 – One third of Final Club presidents are Jewish, according to Morton and Phyllis Keller’s “Making Harvard Modern: The Rise of America’s University.” 
1987 – Lisa J. Schkolnick ’88 files a complaint against the Fly Club for unlawful discrimination. The Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination states that it lacks the jurisdiction to order the club to integrate. 
1993 – Fly undergraduates vote unanimously to include women. A year later, however, they change their minds, favoring “club unity over women” after graduate board intervention.
2004 – The Spee Club elects its first African-American president, Randall J. Winston ’04-’05
2004 – Maureen D. Connelly ’06 and Julia M. Lewandoski ’06 co-launch “Students Against Super Sexist Institutions-We Oppose Oppressive Finals Clubs (SASSI-WOOFCLUBS).”
2006 – Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56 severs his ties with the Owl Club. This move comes after conservatives criticize him for speaking out against then-Supreme Court nominee Samuel A. Alito, Jr.’s involvement in the conservative-leaning Concerned Alumni of Princeton, which had (in Kennedy’s words) been formed “to resist the growing influx of female, African American, Hispanic and even disabled students who were changing the face of Princeton ‘as you knew it.’”
2010 – A group of seven students launches an initiative to combat what they perceive as the Final Clubs’ monopoly on Harvard’s social space.
